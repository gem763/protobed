My hosts were exceptionally gracious, but it was also obvious that the Catholic Church in what was once Germany\u2019s most intensely Catholic region is in terrible shape. The numbers tell the tale.\n\nThe parish in whose rectory I stayed has some 10,000 parishioners\u2014which is to say, the pastor knows that there are 10,000 people within the parish boundaries who, when paying their federal taxes, tick the box for the Kirchensteuer, the \u201cChurch tax.\u201d Having seen years of statistics on Sunday Mass attendance from the German bishops\u2019 conference, I was expecting the pastor to answer my question about his Sunday congregation with a figure somewhere between 700 and 1,000. No, he said; average Sunday Mass attendance among those 10,000 parishioners was 200. And when he asked people politely when he might see them at Mass, he frequently got the answer, \u201cLook, I pay the Church tax; what else do you want?\u201d\n\nSo it was with some interest that I read the recent explanation by Munich\u2019s Cardinal Reinhard Marx as to why he and the majority of the German bishops were defying the Vatican and plowing ahead with their \u201cbinding Synodal process\u201d in order to re-examine \u201cissues\u201d such as the Church\u2019s sexual ethic, its teaching on marriage, and its ancient pattern of ordaining only men to the ministerial priesthood. Cardinal Marx claimed that \u201cCountless believers in Germany consider (these issues) in need of discussion.\u201d The not-so-tacit suggestion was that questions once thought settled by the Church were in fact open.\n\nIn light of my recent experience in the cardinal\u2019s archdiocese, some questions immediately occurred: Who are these \u201ccountless believers\u201d? Do they participate in the Eucharistic community of the Church or do they just pay the Church tax (and get snarky when asked why worship is not on their Sunday agenda)?\n\nAnd further: How many of these \u201ccountless believers,\u201d who seem to think that what is settled is in fact unsettled, have ever had the truths they question explained to them? How many of German Catholicism\u2019s legion of theologians and church workers devote themselves to such teaching? The archdiocese of Munich and Freising has, I was told, some 2,000 employees. Do any of them live the vocation to explain what is challenging in the gospel and the Catholic Church\u2019s application of it?\n\nMoreover, in what time warp do these \u201ccountless believers\u201d live? The Catholic Church has spent an inordinate amount of time and energy over the past 50 years \u201cdiscussing\u201d the \u201cissues\u201d that Cardinal Marx suggests are at the top of German Catholics\u2019 concerns. Isn\u2019t the real problem here that, after a lot of discussion and deliberation, the teaching authority of the Church resolved those issues in a way that \u201ccountless believers\u201d didn\u2019t like and still don\u2019t like\u2014perhaps because the Church\u2019s settled answers are in severe tension with the libertine public moral culture that prevails across western Europe?\n\nA little honesty here would go a long way.\n\nMuch of the Catholic Church in Germany (and in other German-speaking lands) is in a de facto state of schism: Many of its leaders and intellectuals do not believe what the Catholic Church believes. And because of that, they do not teach what the Catholic Church teaches. Nor does this de facto schism touch on neuralgic moral questions alone. It involves the bottom of the bottom line: Is Jesus Christ the unique redeemer of humanity, such that all who are saved are saved through him (in one fashion or another)? Are there divinely revealed truths that remain binding over time? Is the Catholic Church speaking the truth when it solemnly declares that it is doing so irrespective of what the surrounding culture thinks?\n\nCatholicism is dying in the German-speaking world, not because the gospel has been proclaimed and found incredible or hard, but because it hasn\u2019t been proclaimed with joy, confidence, and zeal. Friendship with the Lord Jesus Christ, and incorporation into the community of disciples in mission that is the Church, has not been offered. That is why there is 2 percent Mass attendance in that Munich parish. Recognizing that hard truth is the only path toward a German Catholicism that has something credible to say to the rest of the world Church.\n\nGeorge Weigel is Distinguished Senior Fellow of Washington, D.C.\u2019s Ethics and Public Policy Center, where he holds the William E.
