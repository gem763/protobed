The calls started because both the president and Republican lawmakers wanted more coordination and collaboration, said one senior administration official.\n\nOn Tuesday, dozens of House Republicans stormed a secure hearing room where investigators have been deposing witnesses, which delayed the proceedings. The move came after Trump publicly said he wished Republicans were doing more to defend him \u2013 and after nearly two dozen members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus met with Trump at the White House for over an hour on Tuesday to discuss impeachment and other matters, according to lawmakers and aides.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill, insisted there has been \u201cminimal\u201d coordination between congressional Republicans and the White House.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham praised the House Republicans\u2019 actions, calling them \u201cgreat.\u201d\n\n\u201cDue process is vital and all of these false allegations being made behind closed doors is dangerous for this country,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cI hope the media, which are generally the first to demand transparency by those in power, will call the Democrats out for holding these meetings in secret.\u201d\n\nMore than 45 House Republicans have access to the depositions and transcripts.\n\nBut Trump allies say these different moves aren\u2019t enough of a coordinated defense for such a fast-moving story.\n\n\u201cFolks came rushing into the burning building to help with the Kavanaugh nomination to the Supreme Court. People are more than willing to help President Trump now, but they have to be given some direction or an elevator pitch,\u201d said Jason Miller, who served as senior communications adviser to the Trump 2016 campaign. \u201cOnce you get past the Republican talking points of Democrats running the impeachment inquiry in private and congressional witnesses not saying anything new, the talking points stop. There has be some meat to give to Trump supporters.\u201d\n\nMiller said Republican lawmakers need to do a better job of strategically leaking information to the media from the behind-closed-doors testimony to build Republicans\u2019 nothing-to-see-here argument. He alleges Democrats are leaking tidbits of information every day to drive news cycle favorable to them.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

The White House\u2019s top attorney Pat Cipollone laid out this thinking in a recent eight-page letter to Pelosi.\n\n\u201cBuilding that process argument is very important because it backs up the president\u2019s tweets perfectly,\u201d said David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth, who commended Trump as the best lead messenger in the impeachment fight. \u201cHis supporters do not trust anyone else in Washington.\u201d\n\nBut both McIntosh and other Trump allies argue the White House could marshal more forces to help Trump, with the Club for Growth as one group attempting to lead by example.\n\n\u201cRight now, the boss is doing a good job, but there are very few people amplifying that,\u201d said a former Trump campaign adviser. \u201cThat becomes the ultimate problem.\u201d\n\nConservatives worry the president can\u2019t defend himself all alone and run the country.\n\n\u201cThe Clinton machine did a lot of horrible things but one of the things they did well was set up a war room,\u201d said the conservative leader. \u201cAt this point, all of the White House\u2019s defense is being done via Twitter. No one argues that the president has a huge microphone, and it works for him in the press. Maybe he has got it? I don\u2019t know. I think it is concerning.\u201d\n\nMelanie Zanona contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "A Conservative Leader."], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fe/cd/c5e6347046ed989eeb09770d9990/191023-bannon-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
