She said the company will shut down fake accounts, including those belonging to undercover law enforcement, when they are reported.\n\nThe company\u2019s statement followed the AP\u2019s report Friday that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had authorized its officers to use fake social media accounts in a reversal of a previous ban on the practice.\n\nHomeland Security explained the change to the AP in a statement Friday, stating that fake accounts would make it easier for agents reviewing visa, green card and citizenship applications to search for fraud or security threats. The department didn\u2019t provide comment when asked Tuesday.\n\nThe plan would also be a violation of Twitter\u2019s rules. Twitter TWTR, -1.62% said Friday that it\u2019s still reviewing the new Homeland Security practice. It did not provide further comment.\n\nThe change in policy was preceded by other steps taken by the State Department, which began requiring applicants for U.S. visas to submit their social media usernames this past June, a vast expansion of the Trump administration\u2019s enhanced screening of potential immigrants and visitors.\n\nSuch a review of social media would be conducted by officers in the agency\u2019s Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate on cases flagged as requiring more investigation. The privacy assessment notes that officers can only review publicly available social media available to all users on the platform \u2014 they cannot \u201cfriend\u201d or \u201cfollow\u201d an individual \u2014 and must undergo annual training.\n\nThe officers are also not allowed to interact with users on the social media sites and can only passively review information, according to the DHS document.\n\nWhile lots of social media activity can be viewed without an account, many platforms limit access without one.\n\nFacebook said it has improved the ability to spot fake accounts through automation, blocking and removing millions of fake accounts daily.\n\nTwitter and Facebook both recently shut down numerous accounts believed to be operated by the Chinese government using their platforms under false identities for information operations.", "description": "Facebook said Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security would be violating the company\u2019s rules if agents create fake profiles to monitor the...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ613_facebo_ZG_20190903192609.jpg"}
