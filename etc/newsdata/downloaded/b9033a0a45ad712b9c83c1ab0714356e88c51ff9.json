For me, as an immigrant who came here almost 20 years ago, I came here to chase the American dream of hope, of possibility,\u201d he told The Associated Press backstage. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to contribute to the American economy.\u201d\n\nGurung said he was recently in a meeting, where he had mentioned he wanted to define a new America and was challenged by somebody in the room: \u201cWell, you don\u2019t look American.\u201d It was crystal clear, he said, \u201cwhat the implication was.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what set him thinking about \u201cwhat does America mean? America to me is the sum of all things,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone coming together, and that\u2019s the America I came for.\u201d\n\nFor spring 2020, his show finale included sashes draped on models asking his key question. Floral prints dominated, specifically the rose.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my favorite flower and also America\u2019s national flower,\u201d Gurung said.\n\nModels wore his crowns of flowers and also carried bunches in baskets and bouquets, as if the blooms were \u201cwelcoming different kinds of people in this world, in this country.\u201d\n\nHe put roses of purple, red and yellow on everything from sashes and his statement gowns to men\u2019s trousers and shirts. There was an optimistic shine to many of his looks. Others were adorned with loose feathers.\n\nGurung mixed his celebratory roses with tie-die prints. One men\u2019s look in denim included open red lace at the shoulders and black cowboy boots. Another pair of cowboy boots came in red, worn with jeans and a sleeveless white cotton T-shirt.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all about the flowers. One sleeveless dress with a high side slit was a sparkling patchwork of green, purple, pink and yellow squares and triangles.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the pragmatism of T-shirts and jeans and there\u2019s the fantasy and beautiful glamour of the eveningwear,\u201d Gurung said. \u201cI wanted to marry those two and really question, who does this country belong to?\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With flower crowns and beauty pageant sashes, Prabal Gurung asked a fundamental question of the day: Who gets to be an American?", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Leanne Italie"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/fashion_prabal_gurung_82745_c0-265-3492-2301_s1770x1032.jpg?5c45cb74106fa1c4b6be11e91646d81fcb039ba2", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
