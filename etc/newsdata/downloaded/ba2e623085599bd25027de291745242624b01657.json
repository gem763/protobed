Col. Alexander Vindman, a White House national security official and decorated Iraq war veteran, testified to House impeachment investigators on Tuesday, providing a first-hand account of the phone call in which President Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democrats, including political rival Joe Biden. Vindman listened to the call with other National Security Council officials, and said he was so \"concerned\" that he reported it to NSC lawyers. He said he thought Trump's request for the \"favor\" \u2014 in a conversation touching on military aid to Ukraine \u2014 could be seen as \"a partisan play\" and \"undermine U.S. national security.\" Vindman also reportedly said a transcript released by the White House omitted key phrases, including a Trump reference to Biden. [The Washington Post, The New York Times]\n\n2.\n\nHouse Democrats on Tuesday unveiled their proposed rules for making their impeachment proceedings public. The plan calls for the House Intelligence Committee to hold open hearings, and share its findings in a report on President Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate Democrats. The House leadership is preparing to hold a vote on the rules Thursday. The Intelligence Committee's report is to be passed along to the Judiciary Committee, which would then consider the evidence and produce articles of impeachment to submit to the full House. The draft spells out due process rights for Trump, which Republicans have said Trump has been denied in the current private depositions the House committees are holding. [The New York Times]\n\n3.\n\nBritish lawmakers voted 438-20 on Tuesday to hold a general election on Dec. 12. The House of Commons decision came on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fourth attempt to win approval for an early election to break the impasse over Brexit. The measure now goes to the House of Lords. The last national vote resulted in a \"hung Parliament\" in 2017, producing a government lacking the power to pass its agenda. Johnson's ruling Conservatives are hoping they will pick up seats and win a clear majority so they will be able to get a deal approved so that Britain can exit the European Union as planned. The leader of the main opposition Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, said he and his allies would campaign aggressively, \"giving a message of real hope where this government offers nothing.\" [CNBC]\n\n4.\n\nJudge Myron Thompson of the U.S. District Court in Middle Alabama on Tuesday temporarily blocked Alabama's strict new abortion law, which would have prohibited nearly all abortions in the state. The law, signed by Gov. Kay Ivey (R) in May, would make it a felony to perform an abortion unless a woman's health is at risk, with no exception for rape or incest. The law was to take effect on Nov. 15. Ivey had said the law would provide the Supreme Court an \"opportunity\" to \"revisit\" Roe v. Wade. In his decision, Thompson said the Alabama law \"contravenes clear Supreme Court precedent\" and denies women the right \"to make 'choices central to personal dignity and autonomy.'\" [The New York Times]\n\n5.\n\nThe National Weather Service on Tuesday issued a rare \"extreme red flag warning\" for Southern California, which could face its strongest winds in a decade through Thursday. Authorities said the winds, which could hit 80 miles per hour in some places, could whip up the Getty fire, which has burned 658 acres and several homes in recent days, and remained just 15 percent contained on Tuesday. The blaze has forced thousands of people to evacuate some luxury neighborhoods in Los Angeles, and the high winds threatened to help the wildfire spread. In Northern California, high winds continued to stoke the Kincade fire in Sonoma County wine country, where more than 76,000 acres have burned. That fire has destroyed 189 structures, including 86 houses. [Los Angeles Times, The Mercury News]\n\n6.\n\nCoal giant Murray Energy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday despite regulatory breaks from the Trump administration. President Trump has long vowed to bring back coal jobs and end what he called the \"war on coal\" being waged by Democrats. But Murray, based in Ohio, continued to struggle as utilities switched from coal to cheaper and cleaner alternatives, such as natural gas and renewable energy sources. Murray Energy CEO Robert Murray said the company now will be able to access cash and restructure. Cecil Roberts, president of United Mine Workers of America, said Murray couldn't withstand the combined effect of government preference for gas power generation, and falling coal exports. \"Now comes the part where workers and their families pay the price for corporate decision-making and governmental actions,\" Roberts said in a prepared statement.
