It was really tough. People from my school trolled me anonymously through chat websites, calling me things like 'fat thighs' and 'fat legs'.\n\n\"It affected me a lot mentally. You get that way where you think no-one likes you and people think you\u2019re embarrassing because of the bag.\n\n\"I eventually learnt just to get on with it and accept that my bag is now part of my life.\"\n\nHaving left her difficult school years behind her, Sophie is now studying at children's nursing at Edinburgh Napier University.\n\n(Image: Daily Record WS)\n\nShe recently shared her experience with a bladder bag through a Facebook post.\n\nShe wrote: \"I have realised that it is not something I should be embarrassed by. Life is too short to have others decide your strength.\n\n\"Going through everything I have been through has also made me realise who you really need in life.\n\n\"I went through my teenage years reaching out to people who aren\u2019t in my life now, because when you grow up you realise who truly cares and who is really there for you.\n\n\"My disability has only made me stronger through the years.\"\n\n(Image: Daily Record WS)\n\nThe reaction to the post was overwhelming, with thousands of people expressing their admiration and support in comments.\n\nSophie added: \"The reaction has really blown me away. I've had so many people reaching out.\n\n\"Other people have even sent me messages with pictures of them and their bag. It really has been unbelievable and made me glad I decided to post what I've been through.\n\n\"I\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve been through and who I am today.\n\n\"Long story short, you never know someone else's story, so please be kind with your words and actions.\"", "description": "Sophie Walls from East Dunbartonshire in Scotland decided to speak out about her medical condition in a bold Facebook post", "authors": ["Nicholas Keyden", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Daily Record Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650068.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_xxxxxxxxxx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
