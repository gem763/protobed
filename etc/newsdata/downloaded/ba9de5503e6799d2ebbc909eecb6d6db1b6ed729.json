The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause (the one that binds the federal government) is not intended to protect officeholders\u2014such as the individual who heads the entire federal criminal and military apparatus\u2014from political investigation or a House impeachment trial. Moreover, while a criminal defendant might be sentenced to a fine or imprisonment, a conviction in the Senate means that the president only loses his job. Even targets of grand jury investigations don\u2019t get the panoply of \u201crights\u201d that Cipollone wrongly claims the president deserves under the Constitution at the House stage of the impeachment proceedings\u2014namely, the right to call and cross-examine witnesses, to have counsel present during each stage of the process, to have access to the evidence, to get transcripts of the testimony, and \u201cmany other basic rights guaranteed to all Americans.\u201d\n\nThat said, as Republicans have pointed out, the full House of Representatives held votes formally triggering the impeachment inquiries for presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. For both Nixon and Clinton, the impeachment process began with resolutions giving the Judiciary Committee the power to conduct an investigation into whether grounds for impeachment existed. Republicans argue that this precedent\u2014although not binding\u2014should be followed here.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kim Wehle", "Thebulwark.Com Impeachment-And-The-Due-Process-Canard"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
