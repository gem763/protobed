Just as quickly, Morey deleted his tweet and apologized.\n\nNot only did the NBA clamor to side with the human rights-abusing Chinese government, but, worse, the league\u2019s press release in China was more effusive in abject apology than its statement in the U.S. press:\n\nIt gets worse for @nba. Per @FinancialTimes they provided statements that were translated differently in Chinese and English. Talk about duplicitous. Just pathetic. pic.twitter.com/H242uecC5H \u2014 Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) October 7, 2019\n\nBut not everyone felt that Morey needed to apologize. Both Republicans and Democrats have jumped to criticize the NBA for its support of China over the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, for instance, called the NBA\u2019s reaction \u201cdisgusting\u201d and added that it was \u201cgrotesque\u201d for the league to punish a U.S. citizen just to \u201cprotect the NBA\u2019s market in China.\u201d\n\n.@NBA is throwing the GM of @HoustonRockets under the bus to please the Communist Chinese Govt. Disgusting. They allow #China to punish a U.S. citizen for free speech in order to protect NBA\u2019s market access in China. Grotesquehttps://t.co/77lMHTGZyw \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 7, 2019\n\nRubio was not the only Republican to slam the NBA for its slobbering support of oppressive China. Others, including Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Rick Scott, and others joined Rubio in criticizing the league.\n\nSo let me get this straight. @HoustonRockets GM Daryl Morey expresses support for Hong Kong democracy movement & Chinese government pressures NBA to fire him? Moment of truth for NBA. Will they bow to pressure from repressive, authoritarian govt? https://t.co/S9fChodCfP \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 7, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the @NBA is more interested in money than human rights. Tonight\u2019s statement from Commissioner Silver is an absolute joke. The NBA is kowtowing to Beijing to protect their bottom line and disavowing those with the temerity to #standwithHongKong. Shameful! https://t.co/RBPJa04xzK \u2014 Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) October 7, 2019\n\nAs a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong. Now, in pursuit of big $$, the @nba is shamefully retreating. https://t.co/7waMde5KrM \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) October 7, 2019\n\nDaryl Morey is right. We have an obligation to stand with Hong Kong and hold the CCP accountable for its gross violations of human rights. His willingness to speak the truth is a great embodiment of the @NBA\u2019s global social responsibility campaign. https://t.co/eAdpxCpPJi \u2014 Rep. Mike Gallagher (@RepGallagher) October 6, 2019\n\nGOP Sen. Ben Sasse joined those slamming the NBA, and said that the league\u2019s greed for Chinese cash caused it to support a nation with one of the worst human rights records in the world.\n\nThe Republicans were not alone. A growing list of Democrats also took the NBA to task for its support of China over the pro-democracy movement:\n\nNo one should implement a gag rule on Americans speaking out for freedom. I stand with the people of Hong Kong in their pursuit of democratic rights. I stand with Americans who want to voice their support for the people of Hong Kong. Unacceptablehttps://t.co/5B5KMGZujh \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) October 7, 2019\n\nThe NBA is standing with the authoritarian Chinese government as they suppress democracy and shoot people in the street. I stand with the people of Hong Kong. https://t.co/QcUznmkpyx \u2014 Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) October 7, 2019\n\nChina is using its economic power to silence critics\u2014even those in the U.S. The United States must lead with our values and speak out for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong, and not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government. https://t.co/87U4jgsAAp \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 7, 2019\n\nListen\u2026.some things are more important than money. Like doing the right thing. @dmorey tweeted about human rights and supporting #HongKongProtests. How ironic that you\u2019re siding with communism to advance your greed. https://t.co/RoyJ3o3bbY \u2014 Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) October 7, 2019\n\nThe only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights. What an embarrassment. https://t.co/bbiwCBTwc1 \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) October 7, 2019\n\nBut politicians were far from the only detractors of the NBA\u2019s kow tow to China. Many others, both liberal and conservative, were also horrified by the NBA\u2019s cash grabbing:\n\n\u201cWhen all these NBA activists actually face real potential consequences to their wallet, when they are faced with real human rights abuses, when faced with actual wrongdoing that affects over a billion people\u2026they don\u2019t say a damn word.\u201d \ud83c\udf99 @ClayTravis https://t.co/IhH99P65uu \u2014 FOX Sports Radio (@FoxSportsRadio) October 7, 2019\n\nSo the @NBA will boycott Charlotte, NC over transgender bathrooms, but won't boycott China over Muslim internment camps? \u2014 Liz Wheeler (@Liz_Wheeler) October 7, 2019\n\nThis is who the NBA is apologizing to\u2026 https://t.co/GaSEvKoqze \u2014 sharia board \ud83d\udc73\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc7b\ud83c\udf83 (@SirajAHashmi) October 7, 2019\n\nNBA: Big Money 1, free speech zero \u2014 Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) October 7, 2019\n\nAdam Silver, @SteveKerr, Greg Popovich, @KingJames & @JHarden13 should all be ashamed of themselves. By not supporting @dmorey's call for democracy in China the NBA has proven its \"woke\" act is all hypocritical bullshit. https://t.co/7qVqBNpAsC \u2014 Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) October 7, 2019\n\nNew post: \"Stand for freedom, boycott the NBA\" https://t.co/uAXpjRigEX \u2014 Philip Klein (@philipaklein) October 7, 2019\n\nThe people of Hong Kong are risking their lives to stand up for human rights, and the NBA throws Darly Morey under the bus for a few bucks. Look to the streets of Hong Kong for courage, not to NBA owners. Disgraceful. https://t.co/m8VGkRVUiP \u2014 Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) October 7, 2019\n\nTime for the NBA to issue a statement reiterating that it supports freedom and the rights of people anywhere to engage in legitimate protest and expression. Then let the PRC and PRC basketball fans boycott the entire NBA if they want; they can focus on the CBA instead \u2014 Bill Bishop (@niubi) October 6, 2019\n\nOfficial @NBA statement different in Chinese, much more apologetic. Does NBA think US fans too stupid to notice? #StandWithMorey https://t.co/F3qDfkZqHv \u2014 ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) October 7, 2019\n\nPlease don't forget that the NBA has a training camp in Xinjiang, where upwards of a million Muslims are in concentration camps. https://t.co/64cJiPgHKj \u2014 Isaac Stone Fish (@isaacstonefish) October 7, 2019\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "The reactions to the NBA's \"disgusting\" support of the oppressive Chinese government continues to grow, as a diverse group of Americans take", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1163626850-640x480-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
