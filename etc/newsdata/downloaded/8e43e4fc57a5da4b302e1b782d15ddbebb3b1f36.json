I think that\u2019s misleading.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I am barely over the line as well. It\u2019s not a huge issue. But now I\u2019m facing a fine.\n\n\u2018There was an obstruction on the pavement \u2013 the parking meter \u2013 so I didn\u2019t park right up to the kerb.\n\n\u2018I just feel like I was fined because I have a nice car to be honest. I was just going to the gym. I paid to park. I\u2019m not trying to fleece anyone.\n\n\u2018I believe the bays are no longer suitable for the cars of today. They are wider and bigger now.\u2019\n\nMr Digva, who owns Road Angel, a website that sells travel products, must pay a \u00a350 fine within 28 days, although this can be reduced to \u00a325 if paid within 14 days.\n\nThe business owner has been slammed with a \u00a350 fine (Picture: Nottingham Post/BPM Media)\n\nHowever, he\u2019s refusing to hand over the money and says he will be appealing to the council.\n\nA Nottingham City Council spokesperson said: \u2018We\u2019re sorry to hear that Mr Digva feels his fine was unfair and he is welcome to challenge it through the official appeals process.\n\n\u2018It was issued because his car was parked outside the white lines of the parking bay and a distance from the kerb.\n\n\u2018Drivers are not permitted to park like this, even if they have a valid ticket or permit, because it can create an obstruction for other vehicles and particularly cyclists.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
