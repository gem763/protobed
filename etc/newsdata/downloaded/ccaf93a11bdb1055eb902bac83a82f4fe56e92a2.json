(AP) - South Carolina quarterback Jake Bentley will have season-ending surgery on his fractured left foot.\n\nGamecocks coach Will Muschamp announced Bentley\u2019s decision Sunday. Bentley suffered a Lisfranc fracture in the foot on the final play of a 24-20 loss to North Carolina on Aug. 31 and was in a walking boot and using a scooter to get around on the sideline as South Carolina beat Charleston Southern 72-10 on Saturday.\n\nMuschamp said nothing has been determined about the senior\u2019s future other than he\u2019ll have surgery this week.\n\nBentley thought about going pro last year before returning to the Gamecocks. He has not redshirted so he could come back to South Carolina or leave for a final season as a graduate transfer.\n\nFreshman Ryan Hilinski had 282 yards and accounted for three TDs in South Carolina\u2019s victory. The Gamecocks (1-1) play No. 2 Alabama (2-0) on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "South Carolina quarterback Jake Bentley will have season-ending surgery on his fractured left foot.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/charleston_southern_south_carolina_football_02025_c0-112-2667-1666_s1770x1032.jpg?587010d8a619d8ed2a2dbd4bf483329db9512ee9", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
