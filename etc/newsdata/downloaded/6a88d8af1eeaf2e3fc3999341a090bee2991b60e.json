The whole point of having the gender categories is to make it fair and equal, now we're going the other way and that apparently is progress. I think it's a load of nonsense.\"\n\nHowever, the history of the MTV Music Awards suggests otherwise.\n\nSince they replaced separate best male and best female prizes with an overall best artist award in 2017, the winners have been Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello and Ariana Grande.\n\nAt the National TV Awards, the best drama performance prize has been shared equally between men and women, with recipients including David Tennant, Richard Madden, Suranne Jones and Sheridan Smith.\n\nOrganised by trade body the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), the Brits have awarded prizes along gender lines since their inception in 1977.\n\nAlthough that will not change next year, Award organisers did concede there would be \"significant changes\" that would \"involve more music and some category changes\".\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
