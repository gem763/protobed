She was released early under a prison policy that allows inmates to leave the facility if they are set to be released on weekends, according to NBC News.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHuffman will also have to pay a $30,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service after pleading guilty to mail fraud and honest services fraud charges in May, charges that came from paying an SAT proctor to alter her daughter\u2019s scores.\n\n\"I accept the court\u2019s decision today without reservation,\" the \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d actress said in a statement after her sentencing. \"I have always been prepared to accept whatever punishment Judge Talwani imposed. I broke the law. I have admitted that and I pleaded guilty to this crime. There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period.\"\n\nHuffman was one of dozens of defendants charged in the scandal, dubbed \u201cVarsity Blues\u201d by federal officials.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the Federal Correctional Institution for comment.\n\nUnlike Huffman, fellow actress Lori Loughlin is fighting the Varsity Blues charges against her. Prosecutors say the former \"Full House\" star could face a substantially longer sentence if she is convicted after pleading not guilty.", "description": "Actress Felicity Huffman\u00a0walked out of federal prison on Friday after serving\u00a0less than two weeks for charges\u00a0springing from\u00a0the college admissions scandal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/huffmanfelicity_091419getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
