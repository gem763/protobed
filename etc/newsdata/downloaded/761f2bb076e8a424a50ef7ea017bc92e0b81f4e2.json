As Trysta Krick details, someone forgot to tell Juan Soto. USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 Shhh, keep it quiet, but the Washington Nationals have a secret incentive during this October run, a motivation burning deeply inside them.\n\nSure, everyone knows they\u2019d love to be the first team in Washington Nationals\u2019 history to win the World Series, and the first baseball club from the nation\u2019s capital since Calvin Coolidge was president in 1924.\n\nWhen the Nats closed out the Houston Astros, 5-4, in Game 1 on Tuesday, winning their first World Series game in franchise history, closer Sean Doolittle and catcher Kurt Suzuki solemnly shook hands on the field to commemorate the moment.\n\n\u201cWe congratulated each other on the mound in a very serious way,\u2019\u2019 Doolittle said. \u201cThis is cool. This is historic. The first World Series game. The win. The save. In Nats\u2019 franchise history. To be part of that, it feels really cool.\n\n\u201cThis is history, man.\u2019\u2019\n\nYet, if you want to know the reason they want to win, it\u2019s to actually ease their guilt.\n\nYou see, they\u2019ve been on this insane October run, winning 19 of their last 21 games since Sept. 23, resulting in three wild, commemorative celebrations.\n\nNationals left fielder Juan Soto touches home plate after his homer in the fourth inning.

Shea, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nBut the one perhaps most responsible has had to sit back, and watch everyone else guzzle champagne and beer, while he drinks his own personal bottle of sparkling grape juice.\n\nJuan Soto is just 20 years old.\n\nHe can\u2019t legally drink until his 21st birthday on Friday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to win this,\u2019\u2019 Nats second baseman Brian Dozier said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done all of this celebrating with him, and it sucks, because he\u2019s not old enough to drink.\n\n\u201cWe need to win this so we can do this thing right.\n\n\u201cThis guy is 20 winning a World Series game for us.\u2019\u2019\n\nSoto has yet to buy his first legal drink, but if the Nats continues this magical ride, he will be the toast of the town.\n\nWORLD SERIES: 20-year-old Juan Soto lifts Nationals in Game 1 win\n\nRECORD: Springer sets record with HR in 5th straight World Series game\n\nCRITIC: Springer defends himself for not running out the box in Game 1\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary how good he is,\u2019\u2019 Nats outfielder Gerardo Parra said. \u201cYou hate to compare anyone to Mike Trout, because there\u2019s only one Mike Trout.\n\n\u201cBut if he keeps doing this, I\u2019m telling you, he\u2019s going to be better than Mike Trout.\"\n\nSoto put his talents on baseball\u2019s biggest stage at Minute Maid Park, and stole the show.\n\nNo one could stop talking about him.\n\nLet's see, he hit a 417-foot, opposite-field homer in the fourth inning, becoming the second youngest player to homer in his World Series debut, behind Andruw Jones.\n\nHe hit a two-out, two-run, opposite-field double in the fifth inning, becoming the second-youngest to produce two extra-base hits in a World Series game, behind only Jones.\n\nAnd he became the youngest player in postseason history to homer and steal a base in the same game.\n\nJust another night for the kid.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he realizes the history behind this,\u2019\u2019 Doolittle said, \u201cbecause he wasn\u2019t even born yet when the Nats moved to D.C.\u2019\u2019\n\nWell, to be technical, he was 7 at the time, living in the Dominican Republic, but sorry, he wasn\u2019t quite up-to-date on his baseball-franchise relocation history.\n\nAnd, sorry, he had no idea that it had been 86 years since a Washington baseball team won a World Series game.\n\n\u201cJuan\u2019s grandfather,\u2019\u2019 said first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, the first player in Nats\u2019 history, \u201cprobably wasn\u2019t around.\u2019\u2019\n\nNow, the kid who was discovered in the Dominican by Johnny DiPuglia, the Nationals vice president for international operations, is on his way to becoming the face of baseball.\n\nCertainly, he\u2019s the new Bryce Harper in Washington, and virtually single-handedly has kept their World Series hopes alive.\n\nThe Nats were four outs from being eliminated in the wild-card game against Milwaukee until his bases-loaded, three-run single.\n\nThey were six outs away from going home in Game 5 of the NL Division Series when he homered off three-time Cy Young winner Clayton Kershaw, tying the game, and winning it in the 10th inning.\n\nAnd, on this night, he was the one who made Astros co-ace Gerrit Cole look human, with Cole losing his first game since May 22, snapping a 25-start streak in which he went 19-0 with a 1.59 ERA.\n\n\u201cHe was clearly the key guy that we couldn't control tonight,\u2019\u2019 Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cHis bat speed is electric. His energy and his body is as advertised. He's calm in the moment. Clearly this is not too big a stage for him.\n\n\u201cHe was the difference in the game.\u2019\u2019\n\nReally, he\u2019s the difference in their season.\n\nSoto hit 34 homers with 110 RBI and a .949 on-base percentage during the regular season, and his .403 on-base percentage the last two years is the fifth-best in baseball.\n\nAnd he\u2019s just getting started.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a blessing from God to be here in the big leagues,\u2019\u2019 Soto said Monday, \u201cand play baseball like I have. I never thought I\u2019d be this talented of a player.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Nationals, to steal a line from the Astros\u2019 front office, have never been so (bleeping) happy to have Juan Soto.\n\n\u201cGeez, man, it\u2019s like he wants to get in a couple more homers and extra-base hits before he turns 21,\u2019\u2019 Doolittle said, \u201cso he can have all of the records for a 20-year-old in the playoffs.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no need to remind the Astros, who share the same spring-training complex in West Palm, Fla.\n\nThey are believers.\n\n\u201cI feel like in the last 24 hours,\u2019\u2019 Astros catcher Martin Maldonado said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen Soto more than my wife. You have to prepared, you have to do scouting reports on it. That guy\u2019s good. He\u2019s very good. The numbers he put up this year and last year are amazing.\n\n\u201cFor a young guy like that. \u2026\u2019\u2019\n\nHe\u2019s a 20-year-old with the maturity of a 30-year-old and the plate discipline of a 40-year-old.\n\n\u201cI don't even look at him as young until you see his face,\u2019\u2019 Hinch said. \u201cHe's got kind of the 'it' factor. He's got the twitch. He's got fast hands. He's got no fear.\n\n\"It looks like he's completely in control of enjoying the moment.\n\n\u201cHe's mature. Don't let the age fool you.\u2019\u2019\n\nPressure? Nervousness?\n\nYou kidding?\n\nNot Soto.\n\n\u201cSometimes I just put gum in my mouth,\u2019\u2019 Soto said, explaining his mode of relaxation, \u201cbut most of the time just take a deep breath and focus. It's just the pitcher and me. Everybody around, I forget about everybody around.\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s a fight. Just the pitcher and me. That's how everything comes down.\n\n\u201cI just try to enjoy it.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd, oh, will they ever, tossing away that grape juice, dousing Soto with all of the champagne and beer they can find, and even watching him partake.\n\nSays Dozier: \u201cTo have our first drink with him during a World Series celebration, man, how sweet will that be?\u2019\u2019\n\nFollow Bob Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale", "description": "Washington's 20-year-old outfielder was the hero in Game 1, delivering a home run and three RBI in a 5-4 win over the Astros.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
