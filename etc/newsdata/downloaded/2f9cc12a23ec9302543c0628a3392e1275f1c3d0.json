The truth has slipped in: Abortion is a violent act, the taking of a human life.\n\nAnd having the truth plastered on the front page of the local paper is bad for business. South Bend\u2019s newly minted abortion clinic offered a statement over the weekend, expressing shock at the news and reading in part: \u201cWhole Woman\u2019s Health of South Bend is proud to serve the community with high-quality abortion care services that respect the dignity of women and families. We adhere to the highest healthcare standards and we treat our patients with compassion and respect when they need it most.\u201d\n\nIf all that health-care standards and compassion require is not to transport home the remains of aborted fetuses at the end of the workday, perhaps the Whole Woman\u2019s Health abortionist can manage it. But there is little distinction between what happens in that clinic and what happened at Klopfer\u2019s, between what their abortionist will do to those tiny bodies and what Klopfer did to the 2,246 found in his home.", "description": "", "authors": ["Alexandra Desanctis", "Nationalreview.Com These-Are-Human-Beings"], "top_image": ""}
