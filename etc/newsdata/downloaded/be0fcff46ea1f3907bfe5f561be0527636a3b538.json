Sullivan, You'd Better Start, Because Clarence Thomas Is Gunning for It", "language": "en", "text": "New York Times v. Sullivan is a unanimous Supreme Court decision handed down in 1964. It held that for a public figure to win a libel case against a news outlet, she or he would have to prove \u201cactual malice\u201d: that they printed something false either knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth. For over 50 years, it has been at the bedrock of freedom of the press, all the more so in an age when the president of the United States has labeled the press \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that he\u2019d possibly overturn it.\n\nThe context, perhaps ironically, was an appeal stemming from the Bill Cosby case. One of Cosby\u2019s accusers, Kathrine McKee, told her story to the Daily News, and Cosby\u2019s lawyer wrote a letter to the News accusing her of lying. McKee sued for defamation.\n\nShe lost, and the Supreme Court denied her a hearing, because as soon as McKee told her story to the press, she became a \u201cpublic figure,\u201d and, under NY Times v. Sullivan, she could only win a defamation suit if she proved \u201cactual malice\u201d on the part of those publishing the letter. Not only did the letter have to be false; the lawyer and the Daily News had to know it was false, or recklessly disregard whether it was false or not.\n\nThe question actually before the Court was whether McKee was really a \u201cpublic figure\u201d or not. But Justice Thomas took the opportunity to expand beyond that question to whether NY Times v. Sullivan, which no one has seriously questioned for years, is valid in the first place.\n\nIn a jaw-dropping 14-page opinion, he wrote that it probably is not.\n\nEssentially, Thomas\u2019s argument is originalism on steroids. Because when the First Amendment was adopted in 1791 (and later extended to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment), public figures could sue for libel, so they should be able to now.\n\nThe funny thing about \u201coriginalism,\u201d though, is how impossible it is to actually prove anything. In Thomas\u2019s opinion, he duly lists about a dozen examples of how libel against public figures was a crime in the 18th century.\n\nBut he also acknowledges that there were strict limits on that crime, how the \u201cpublic conduct of a public man\u201d was indeed exempted from prosecution, and how several statements made by James Madison and other Founders suggest that the First Amendment right to freedom of the press does, indeed, require allowing newspapers to print allegations which turn out to be false.\n\nInterpreting and balancing this conflicting evidence, Thomas concludes that there is \u201clittle historical evidence suggesting that the New York Times actual-malice rule flows from the original understanding of the First or Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d\n\nThat sounds very textually and historically grounded, but Thomas\u2019s interpretation and balancing are no less selective and subjective than a more principled, rights-based approach that asks what the real-world consequences of such a position would be.\n\nAfter all, he\u2019s weighting some sources over others amidst an ultimately inconclusive pool of available documentation. How is that more \u201cobjective\u201d than inquiring into whether there can be a meaningful freedom of the press if public figures can sue for libel when they don\u2019t like what is said about them?\n\nThomas dismisses such questions as whether New York Times has been \u201cpopular in some circles.\u201d But to ask about the real-world context of the First Amendment in 2019 isn\u2019t about popularity; it\u2019s about principle.\n\nIf he were to ask those questions, the answers would be devastating. Were New York Times overturned, news outlets would have to fact-check every assertion made by every writer, columnist, and even advertiser. (New York Times v. Sullivan itself was about a paid advertisement criticizing police brutality against civil rights leaders.) The consequences of one untrue allegation would be imprisonment.\n\nTo call this a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the free press is a massive understatement. No newspaper could report on as-yet-unproven but credibly sourced allegations\u2014regarding Russian kompromat against our president, for example, or regarding sexual harassment allegations against a Supreme Court Justice (or two). For better or for worse, the entire industry of entertainment journalism, which focuses on the private lives of public figures, would simply cease to exist, since anything damaging and false could be prosecuted.\n\n\u201c Justice Thomas would hand Donald Trump a machine gun. \u201d\n\nAll of this is doubly, triply true in the age of Donald Trump. Trump is a serial liar with contempt for the truth, for the rule of law, and for the free press. Most recently, defending a declaration of national emergency, he made up \u201cstats\u201d about immigrant crime, lied about drug interdiction, and attacked two news networks.\n\nHe has a large number of deeply relevant personal entanglements, which may well explain his fealty to Russia. He has threatened news outlets, again and again. And he has assiduously tried to sue his opponents into submission, using defamation law in particular, for over 30 years.\n\nJustice Thomas would hand him a machine gun.\n\nAgain, this does not mean that courts should make policy. It means that they should inquire into the real-world consequences of their decisions, in 2019 rather than 1791, and ask whether those consequences uphold or vitiate the constitutional rights at issue. A guarantee of freedom of the press is meaningless if wealthy individuals can stifle legitimate discourse regarding public figures. Just ask Gawker.\n\nAnd New York Times is hardly the free-for-all Justice Thomas describes. Remember, Hulk Hogan beat Gawker, not on libel grounds but on invasion of privacy. And there are numerous cases in which \u201cactual malice\u201d can, indeed, be proven: it is still illegal to publish statements with reckless disregard for the truth.\n\nIndeed, the conclusion to this very article illustrates the danger of overturning New York Times v. Sullivan.\n\nSuppose I were to speculate that Thomas has a specific interest in protecting the private lives of public figures because of his own very public debacle in 1991, when he was accused of sexual harassment by a former employee, Anita Hill. In the era of #metoo, many people have sought to revisit these claims or even mount efforts to impeach Justice Thomas himself.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether this highly personal motivation is behind Thomas\u2019s opinion. But it\u2019s a valid question to ask, since it is germane to the reasoning of a Supreme Court justice in a high-profile case.\n\nYet if Times v. Sullivan were overturned, such speculation could be impossible. Which maybe is what Thomas really wants.
