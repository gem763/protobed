Critics say it\u2019s a torture chamber.", "language": "en", "text": "McKamey Manor, based in Summertown, Tenn., bills itself as \u201can audience participation event in which (YOU) will live your own Horror Movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstand that each tour will be different based upon your personal fears, and can last up to 10 HOURS,\u201d the website says. \u201cEach guest will be mentally and physically challenged until you reach your personal breaking point.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAn online petition with tens of thousands of signatures says it\u2019s all a front for a torture chamber and urges state officials to shut down the attraction.\n\nAD\n\nThe complicated screening process for McKamey Manor is meant to select participants who can be easily manipulated as the attraction\u2019s cast duct-tapes their heads, forces them to eat things and waterboards them, according to the petition, which had been signed by more than 67,000 people by Wednesday afternoon. The petition also claims that founder Russ McKamey hires employees with violent histories and makes people ingest pills that cause hallucinations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally just a kidnapping and torture house,\u201d the petition says. \u201cSome people have had to seek professional psychiatric help and medical care for extensive injuries.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMcKamey told The Washington Post that he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to confirm or deny which areas are real and which are not\u201d from the petition but that no torture or illegal activities are part of the experience. Law enforcement keeps a close eye on the manor, he said, and he calls police to warn them before each new participants begin the tour in case they get reports of any issues.\n\nAD\n\nMcKamey said he does, however, use mental techniques to convince people they are experiencing things that they are not. He said he films every visit so he has proof of what happened and didn\u2019t happen during it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no torture, there\u2019s nothing like that, but under hypnosis if you make someone believe there\u2019s something really scary going on, that\u2019s just in their own mind and not reality,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nHundreds of haunted house attractions alarm and delight Americans each year, particularly around Halloween. \u201cExtreme\u201d haunted houses, which aim to terrorize through physical and psychological stress, are less common. They are often subject to fierce criticism, while thrill-seekers line up for the chance to be scared out of their minds.\n\nSince a story about the manor from WFLA-TV this month made waves online, McKamey said he has kept his phone on \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode because thousands of people have been calling to set up visits. He said the attraction has a long wait list.\n\nAD\n\nThe manor, he said, is an interactive experience that relies on mind games meant to make people believe things that aren\u2019t really happening. He said people are not really waterboarded, for example, but he uses hypnosis and other mind-control techniques to put that thought in their heads.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re good enough and you\u2019re able to get inside somebody\u2019s noggin like the way that I can,\u201d McKamey said, \u201cI can make folks believe whatever I want them to believe.\u201d\n\nMcKamey, who said he served in the Navy for 23 years and moonlights as a wedding singer, started the manor 30 years ago as a cross between his theatrical background and his love for haunted houses. In all that time, he said, no one has completed the manor experience.\n\nReservations are required to tour McKamey Manor, and only one or two people are allowed in at a time. Participants have to be over 21, or between 18 and 20 with a parent\u2019s permission. Guests who are pregnant or claustrophobic, or have seizures, respiratory, or heart issues, are urged not to participate. The cost of admission is a bag of dog food for McKamey\u2019s five dogs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nParticipants start the tour with the chance to earn $20,000 and lose $500 every time they fail an activity, McKamey said. He also takes away $500 if a guest says a curse word, since cursing is not allowed at the manor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like the most strait-laced guy you could think of, but here I run this crazy haunted house,\u201d McKamey said. \u201cAnd people twist it around in their little minds.\u201d\n\nMcKamey said he has invested more than $1 million in the attraction, which is a mobile experience. Guests start in Summertown, but McKamey said he transports them to different locations in Tennessee and rents out other people\u2019s farms and abandoned buildings for the stunts.\n\nAD\n\nIf participants lasted long enough in the experience, McKamey said they would end up in Huntsville, Ala. No one, however, has ever gotten that far.\n\n\u201cIt really is a magic act, what I do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of smoke and mirrors.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Participants in the horror experience at McKamey Manor are waterboarded and forced to eat things, a petition says.
