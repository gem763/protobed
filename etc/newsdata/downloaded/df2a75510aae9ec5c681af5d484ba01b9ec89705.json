But that has been delayed.\n\nThe railway was a pet project of President Uhuru Kenyatta who opened the extension on Wednesday.\n\nKenyatta was re-elected for a five-year term in 2017 after promising to develop the East African nation's infrastructure, but it has been dogged by problems.\n\nIn April, China refused to fund the planned $3.7 billion extension from Naivasha to the Ugandan border town of Malaba.\n\nTransport Minister James Macharia said then that the government would spend $210 million to rehabilitate the colonial-era Malaba line instead.\n\nKenyatta rejected criticism of his plans, likening suggestions that the new railway was to \"nowhere\" to criticism of the original Uganda-Kenya railway by politicians during the British colonial era, who called it the \"lunatic express\".\n\n\"Those who think they will take us backwards, they should leave Kenya and look for another country,\" Kenyatta said as he opened the new railway.\n\nWu Peng, the Chinese ambassador to Kenya, said the railway from Mombasa had already had a positive impact on the economy, citing tourism, investments and communications.\n\n\"More jobs will be created,\" Wu said at the same ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n\nTOO EXPENSIVE\n\nMany importers say the new Mombasa to Nairobi railway is too expensive to move freight and have been angered by government attempts to force them to use it.\n\nIt costs about $800 to truck a container from Mombasa to Nairobi, but $1,100 by rail, mainly due to extra costs for moving goods from the rail terminus to an inland depot.\n\nSome Naivasha residents questioned the government's priorities.\n\n\"Even as they build the railway, they should also repair this road,\" Dominic Njogu, a 35-year-old \"bodaboda\", slang for motorbike, driver, said of the road serving tourist resorts, flower farms and Naivasha itself.\n\n\"It is full of big potholes and we have even lost some lives as cars and motorbikes swerve to avoid the holes.\"\n\nGovernment borrowing has been ramped up to fund the railway and other projects such as roads. Total public debt stands at about 55% of GDP, up from 42% when Kenyatta took power in 2013.\n\nLast week, parliament raised the government's debt ceiling to 9 trillion shillings ($87 billion) after it came close to hitting the earlier limit of 6 trillion shillings.\n\nLee Kinyanjui, the governor of Nakuru county which includes Naivasha, said the arrival of the railway will spur investments.\n\n\"We have eight major companies who want to come set up here in Naivasha,\" Kinyanjui told the ceremony at the Mai Mahiu station near Naivasha, without specifying which ones.\n\nHe also said the line will help boost transport infrastructure in the region and lower costs for farmers.
