In a typical week, the under-35s spend \u00a3203 on fundamentals including housing, utility bills and transport \u2013 the largest proportion of any age group.\n\nOnce told of these figures, a quarter of over-50s said the revelation made them want to give more financial support to a younger relative.\n\nAngus Hanton, co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, says: \u2018Rather than being a generation of latte-drinking, country-hopping spendthrifts, young people today are under serious financial pressure from precarious employment, stagnating wages, high housing costs, sky-high student debt, high energy bills and the cost of domestic transport.\u2019\n\nHouseholds run by people in the 51 to 65 age bracket spend a smaller proportion of weekly expenditure on essentials than households in any other age group.\n\nHanton adds: \u2018Younger people face major challenges to put money aside and save for a rainy day. We have to do more so that different generations can help each other when they need it most.\u2019\n\nMore than 70 per cent of over-50s involved in the study were also unaware they could pass on \u00a33,000 a year in cash gifts, free of tax\n\nMore than 70 per cent of over-50s involved in the study were also unaware they could pass on \u00a33,000 a year in cash gifts, free of tax.\n\nThis is known as an \u2018exempted gift\u2019 under inheritance tax laws. So when someone passes away, cash gifts of \u00a33,000 a year are not counted when adding up how much inheritance tax is paid from the value of their estate.\n\nThe IF charity is campaigning for this limit to be raised to \u00a311,900 \u2013 a figure that would exist now had it been uprated in line with inflation since 1981, when it last increased.\n\nChancellor Sajid Javid hinted at Inheritance Tax changes at the Conservative party conference.\n\nOther \u2018exempted\u2019 cash gifts that can be given away each financial year free of tax include wedding or civil ceremony gifts of up to \u00a31,000 per person, \u00a32,500 for a grandchild or great-grandchild and \u00a35,000 for a child.
