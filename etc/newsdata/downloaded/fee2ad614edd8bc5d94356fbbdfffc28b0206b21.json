And then I want you to take action.\u201d\n\nInstead of prepared remarks, Thunberg submitted a 2018 report on global warming by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which warned about the impacts of global warming of 1.5\u00b0C that researchers say is likely between 2030 and 2052 if it continues at the current rate.\n\n\u201cThis is not political views or my opinions,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is science.\u201d\n\nThe hearing was part of a series of events intended to raise awareness of global warming before a planned \u201cclimate strike\u201d on Friday, when students around the world are being encouraged to walk out of schools and jobs to demand action on climate change before the annual United Nations General Assembly later this month.\n\nThunberg chastised members of the Senate Climate Change Task Force on Tuesday for inaction.\n\n\u201cPlease save your praise. We don\u2019t want it,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cDon\u2019t invite us here to tell us how inspiring we are without doing anything about it because it doesn\u2019t lead to anything.\u201d\n\nSwedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg testifies on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.

It doesn\u2019t matter how talented we are, how much work we put in, how many dreams we have. The reality is, my generation has been committed to a planet that is collapsing.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump and his administration have been widely criticized for rolling back Obama-era environmental protections, withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord and resisting the conclusions by the vast majority of scientists that global warming has been caused by humans.\n\nOn Monday, Thunberg met with former President Barack Obama at his Washington, D.C., offices.\n\nJust 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet\u2019s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she\u2019s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. pic.twitter.com/VgCPAaDp3C \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) September 17, 2019\n\n\u201cNo one is too small to have an impact and change the world,\u201d Thunberg said in a video posted to Twitter by the former president\u2019s charitable foundation. \u201cSo do everything that you can.\u201d\n\nThunberg, who has been nominated for a Nobel Prize for her work raising awareness about climate change, has become an inspirational figure for fellow teens. Last month, she sailed from Europe to the United States on a zero-emission yacht.\n\nArriving in New York City after her 15-day trip across the Atlantic Ocean, she was asked if she had a message for Trump.\n\n\u201cMy message for him is listen to the science,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cAnd he obviously doesn't do that.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Appearing on Capitol Hill for the second straight day, Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg urged U.S. lawmakers to take action.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dO.gwrybSBZLuNVcT.ODSA--~B/aD0zMDI4O3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/bc833a80-da26-11e9-aff5-3ddc1a96f2da", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
