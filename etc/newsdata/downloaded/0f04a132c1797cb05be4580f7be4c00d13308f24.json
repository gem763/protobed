Their identity is no longer relevant.", "language": "en", "text": "Over the past month, we have all learned more facts \u2014 from the White House\u2019s summarized transcript of the July call with Ukraine\u2019s president, from text messages provided to the House of Representatives by the former U.S. special representative for Ukraine, and from congressional testimony by people intimately involved with the circumstances the whistleblower first raised concern about. Much of what has been disclosed since the release of our client\u2019s complaint actually exceeds the whistleblower\u2019s knowledge of what transpired at the time the complaint was submitted. Because our client has no additional information about the president\u2019s call, there is no justification for exposing their identity and all the risks that would follow.\n\nHowever, even as the emerging facts have substantiated our client\u2019s complaint, the president continues to repeatedly ask, \u201cWhere\u2019s the whistleblower?\u201d (He did this as recently as Thursday night.) He has even described our client as a \u201cso-called whistleblower\u201d and suggested that the whistleblower is passing on information from Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Perhaps most concerning is that the president has equated whistleblowers with \u201cspies,\u201d even stating: \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d In the \u201cold days,\u201d spies were executed. It is clear to all what the president was suggesting.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bakaj", "Washingtonpost.Com Outlook We-Represent-The-Whistleblower-Their-Identity-Is-No-Longer-Relevant"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
