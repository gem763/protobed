Today\u2019s gaming laptops are not only capable of playing the latest games at high frame rates, but they can also pull double duty for productivity work just as easily.\n\nAlienware\u2019s new Area-51m, which starts at around $1,950 and can be configured well north of $5,000, is not one of those gaming laptops. It is a behemoth that calls back to the time when all gaming laptops were thick, heavy computers that never left the comfort of a sturdy desk.\n\nBut while the Area-51m is twice as heavy and almost twice as thick as the latest Razer Blade or thin MSI gaming laptops, it does things that those computers just can\u2019t. It\u2019s more powerful, thanks to a desktop-class processor and full-power mobile GPU, instead of the lower-power Max Q graphics cards and mobile processors found in those other machines. Unlike most, it has a 17-inch display and a full-size keyboard, with both a number pad and macro keys. But it also has the ability to let you upgrade its primary components when better, faster chips become available. That\u2019s just not something you can do with the vast majority of gaming laptops on the market right now \u2014 whether they\u2019re thin or not.\n\nThe Area-51m is technically not the first laptop to offer this kind of upgradability. There have been big clunkers of laptops in the past that let you upgrade the CPU, and there\u2019s still an upgradeable GPU standard called MXM. But there\u2019s not much movement or competition in the MXM market \u2014 an RTX 2080 module alone could cost you upwards of $1500, and the laptops that can make use of them are few and far between.\n\nTo avoid having to use MXM, Alienware\u2019s parent company Dell developed its own system for workstations called DGFF (Dell Graphics Form Factor) that allows it to put the latest GPUs on modular boards that can then be swapped out. The Area-51m is the first consumer laptop to make use of this new platform.\n\nFuture upgradeability is a nice thing to have, but when you\u2019re spending $2,000 or more on a laptop, you don\u2019t want to have to upgrade any of it anytime soon. The Area-51m\u2019s design may immediately separate from the rest of the gaming laptop pack, but if it\u2019s really going to justify its cost, it needs to be a top performer out of the box.\n\nFortunately for Alienware, it is.\n\nOur review of Alienware Area-51m Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Desktop-class performance\n\nVery effective cooling system\n\nUpgradable CPU and GPU Bad Stuff Requires two large power adapters\n\nPortable in only the most literal sense\n\nExtremely high cost relative to other gaming systems Buy for $1,949.99 from Dell\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps best to think of the Area-51m as a \u201cportable desktop,\u201d as opposed to a laptop or truly mobile computer. It\u2019s a massive machine, weighing over 8.5 pounds and measuring 1.7 inches at its thickest point. It has two power adapters, which vary in size depending on the internal configuration, but they add at least another few pounds to the total package. This isn\u2019t the kind of computer you can just unplug and carry away from your desk; moving it from place to place is a production each time.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the kind of laptop you\u2019ll use while traveling\n\nIt\u2019s also not the kind of computer you\u2019ll be able to use while traveling. Sure, you can bring it from one place to another, but you won\u2019t be gaming along the way because that demands two power outlets, and the giant machine is practically unsafe to use on your lap. Even though the Area-51m is far heavier and larger than most modern laptops (gaming or not), it\u2019s a pound lighter than the Alienware 17 it replaces, thanks to its new magnesium alloy chassis.\n\nThe Area-51m\u2019s overall design signals a new direction for Alienware, and it will inform other products the company releases in the future. I like it: the matte white (\u201clunar light\u201d in Alienware\u2019s marketing-speak) model I\u2019ve been using for this review is modern, attractive, and smooth to the touch.\n\nBut it\u2019s not subtle: there\u2019s no mistaking this for anything but a gaming laptop, with its multiple alien head logos and various lighting effects. The most prominent design feature is the gigantic rear exhaust, with its hexagonally patterned grates for ventilation, surrounded by a single ring of LED light that makes the whole assembly look a bit like the engine of a sci-fi spaceship. I don\u2019t mind the look, but if you want a sleeper gaming rig, this isn\u2019t it.\n\nIn terms of basic specs and layout, the Area-51m has a full-size, non-chiclet keyboard with a number pad, a traditional trackpad with physical buttons (it lights up when you touch it), and a 17-inch display with slim bezels on the sides and top. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of the keyboard or the trackpad \u2014 both feel like something that would have been appropriate on a computer a decade ago \u2014 but if you\u2019re coming from an older Alienware laptop, you\u2019ll feel right at home.\n\nThe keyboard and trackpad feel dated\n\nThe keyboard has customizable macro keys and full RGB lighting options, and since most people will instantly plug a gaming mouse into the side of the Area-51m, the trackpad\u2019s small size and so-so tracking performance aren\u2019t that much of an issue. My biggest complaint is the annoyingly squeaky N key on my review unit, but I have a feeling that is limited to my sample. Still, it\u2019s not something I\u2019d want to put up with on a multi-thousand-dollar computer.\n\nAlienware offers four different display options with the Area-51m, but they all share the same size and resolution: 17 inches and 1080p. The display on my higher-end review unit is a 144Hz panel with Nvidia\u2019s G-Sync tech plus built-in Tobii eye tracking, and it\u2019s great for gaming. It\u2019s fast, there\u2019s little to no ghosting, and its anti-glare finish helps cut down reflections. It\u2019s not the brightest screen, especially compared to something like a MacBook Pro, but it\u2019s about average for gaming laptops, and it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be using this thing outside anyway.\n\nI do wish there were higher-resolution options since the Area-51m\u2019s hardware is definitely capable of pushing more pixels, but Alienware tells me that there just aren\u2019t 17-inch, high-resolution, high-refresh panels with slim bezels available yet. When those components are available, it will make them an option at the time of purchase on the Area-51m, it says. (The display is not something you\u2019ll be able to upgrade after the fact.)\n\nThe Area-51m has a good number of ports, but it has room for even more\n\nThe Area-51m has the standard set of ports you\u2019d expect on a gaming laptop in 2019: three USB-A 3.1 ports, a Thunderbolt 3 Type-C port, HDMI, Mini DisplayPort, 2.5-gigabit Ethernet, a headset jack, a microphone jack, and Alienware\u2019s proprietary graphics amplifier port for an external GPU. That\u2019s probably enough ports for the average gamer, but I\u2019d have liked to have seen even more, including an SD card slot. There\u2019s a lot of empty space on the Area-51m\u2019s chassis that could be used for more I/O, and multiple Thunderbolt 3 ports or an SD card slot would have made the computer much more attractive to the content creators that would use its horsepower for video editing and other tasks.\n\nInside the hulking chassis is a Z390 chipset, with a desktop processor, up to 64GB (four sticks) of RAM, two M.2 SSD slots, a 2.5-inch drive bay, and Dell\u2019s DGFF modular graphics card. You can get the Area-51m with a Core-i7 8700 processor and Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU to start, but I think most people interested in this machine will opt for the higher-end (and more expensive) configurations. The model I\u2019ve been testing has the Core i9-9900K processor, RTX 2080 GPU, 32GB of DD4 2400MHz RAM, two 512GB M.2 SSDs (in a RAID 0 setup for a total of 1TB of fast storage), and an additional 1TB hybrid drive for more storage. Alongside the Tobii eye-tracking and 144Hz G-Sync display, this configuration costs about $4,500.\n\nIt is possible to buy the lower-end configurations and then upgrade down the road \u2014 after all, this is a desktop processor and modular graphics card \u2014 but that really only makes sense for upgrading to new generations of CPUs and GPUs, not ones from the same generation. Stepping up from the 8700 processor to the 9900K is a $450 option when you buy the Area-51m; doing it after the fact will cost about $525 at today\u2019s processor prices.\n\nThe battery inside the Area-51m is a large, 90 watt-hour unit, but that doesn\u2019t translate into great battery life. In my tests, I was able to get about 90 minutes to two hours of use between charges for productivity work and closer to 30 minutes while gaming. That means you\u2019ll want to carry around both of the Area-51m\u2019s power adapters when you bring the computer places, as you\u2019ll need both of them for full-power gaming. It is possible to rely on just the smaller, 180W charger for productivity work, but if you\u2019re already lugging the Area-51m around, you might as well fully commit.\n\nAll of those specs and power mean little if the components can\u2019t stay cool enough to run optimally, which is the biggest challenge with gaming laptops. Fortunately, the cooling system Alienware developed for the Area-51m is excellent, and it\u2019s able to keep both the CPU and GPU at temps well below their throttling points. It\u2019s not silent \u2014 the fan system is very loud, especially when at full speed \u2014 but it\u2019s effective, and it lets the Area-51m hit performance numbers that are much closer to what a desktop provides than a laptop.\n\nLoud fans are not really unusual for a gaming laptop, and if you\u2019re in the market for the Area-51m, you probably expect it. There are powerful speakers up front that can overpower the fan noise, but most people will just want to use a headset while gaming so they don\u2019t have to hear the fans at all. You just might not be able to get away with using the Area-51m in a quiet office or library without getting some dirty looks.\n\nPlaying games is what the Area-51m was designed to do, and it does that job excellently. It is able to play virtually any modern AAA game I throw at it with the graphical settings maxed out and still maintain high frame rates. Even games like Battlefield V and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which have a lot of eye candy and special ray-tracing lighting effects, could be played with virtually every setting turned on and maxed out and the Area-51m still maintains frame rates between 60 and 80 frames per second. That\u2019s not quite the full 144Hz that this screen can push, but it\u2019s still high enough for a great experience in those games.\n\nCompetitive shooting games, like Apex Legends, Overwatch, CS:GO, and everyone\u2019s favorite, Fortnite, can be played with all of their graphical features enabled at 120 to 144 frames per second. Players that prefer high frame rates over eye candy can configure these games with lower settings and run them at hundreds of frames per second, which is well more than the native refresh rate of the display. If stock settings aren\u2019t providing enough power, Alienware\u2019s Command Center offers overclocking options for both the CPU and GPU to squeeze even more performance out of them.\n\nThe high-end Area-51m configurations have plenty of headroom for competitive gaming\n\nAll of that performance headroom highlights the Area-51m\u2019s bottleneck: the display\u2019s resolution. I have no doubt that the Area-51m could easily push a 1440p panel or maybe even a 4K display in lots of games, but for the time being, you\u2019re limited to 1080p. If you\u2019re after the fastest frame rates you can get, you probably prefer a high-refresh rate screen, but if you are more into visual presentation and eye-candy, more resolution is appreciated, especially for non-gaming applications. For now, if you want to game or work at a higher resolution on the Area-51m, you\u2019ll just have to use an external display.\n\nAs it stands, the Area-51m is the most powerful gaming laptop you can buy, and its upgradeable features mean it could remain powerful for years to come. When we opened up the Area-51m ourselves, we found that \u2014 while it isn\u2019t exactly easy \u2014 swapping out the CPU and GPU isn\u2019t much different than doing so on an average desktop gaming PC. But there\u2019s an asterisk next to all of this: we don\u2019t know for sure that the next generation of Intel processors or Nvidia or AMD GPUs will actually fit in this computer or how much those modular graphics cards will cost. Dell has said that if it\u2019s possible to physically and electrically fit the chips onto its swappable graphics boards, it will offer upgrade options, but Dell admits it doesn\u2019t necessarily know what Nvidia\u2019s next plans are.\n\nThat uncertainty makes it tough to swallow the Area-51m\u2019s price because we really don\u2019t know if this experiment will last. For the cost of a well-configured Area-51m, you could buy a desktop computer and monitor with similar power and still have enough money left over to buy a more mainstream thin-and-light gaming laptop for when you want to game on the go.\n\nThe reality of Alienware\u2019s upgradability plans remains to be seen\n\nThe Area-51m is an unrealistic option for most gamers. The kind of gamer who is going to demand this level of performance in a portable machine and put up with all of the compromises and costs necessary to get it is likely a competitive e-sports player or a virtual reality game developer who needs an easier way to transport their desktop to the next trade show.\n\nThat said, what Alienware has done with the Area-51m is really impressive. Not only does it hit performance marks unmatched by other portable machines, but it doesn\u2019t have any glaring issues or show-stopping usability problems that bring it down, other than the obvious compromises with its size and weight. Even just being able to cool these desktop components efficiently enough for them to perform this well in a portable machine is a genuine feat. If you are the type of gamer who wants the ultimate power in a portable machine and are willing to pay any cost to get it, the Area-51m is for you.\n\nFor the rest of us, I\u2019m hopeful that Dell\u2019s plans for upgradability pan out because I\u2019m very curious to see where the Area-51m\u2019s ideas on performance and portability go in the future.", "description": "Alienware\u2019s new Area-51m isn\u2019t just a high-end gaming laptop with lots of power (although it definitely is that). It\u2019s also a laptop that can be upgraded like a desktop, including both its CPU and GPU.", "authors": ["Dan Seifert", "Apr"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6HftjbRE0ahIwpEEcXh2uDhjAT8=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16006212/akrales_190403_3328_0058.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-04"}
