His accuracy improved, the turnovers vanished and he was so efficient, Penix took a seat before halftime.\n\nNow, he\u2019s searching for a favorite receiver - not easy with all the available options in the Hoosiers\u2019 revamped spread offense.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great. Receivers love it,\u201d Penix said after Saturday\u2019s 52-0 rout over Eastern Illinois. \u201cThey always come to me, appreciate and love when they get the ball and I love throwing it to all of them, so they all work extremely hard in practice. Whoever is open, I tell them I\u2019m going to get them the ball and I make sure that happens.\u201d\n\nThrough the first two games, Penix has been true to his word.\n\nThirteen players already have receptions, and the five touchdown passes have been split between five different guys.\n\nThere was little to quibble with Saturday, when Penix and Peyton Ramsey were a combined 27 of 34 with 423 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions - connecting with 12 different receivers. Nick Westbrook, who led the Hoosiers in yards receiving (95) and TD catches (six) in 2016 didn\u2019t even catch a pass.\n\nInstead, Donovan Hale recorded the first 100-game of his career and Whop Philyor was selected the Hoosiers\u2019 offensive player of the game with a four-catch, 75-yard performance.\n\n\u201cI thought he set the tone for us with that first third-down catch he made as well as just the tough hard-nosed run he had that I thought was just a good tone- setter,\u201d coach Tom Allen said at Monday\u2019s weekly news conference.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the receivers.\n\nIndiana (2-0) ran the ball 34 times for 113 yards and three more touchdowns while the defense allowed only five first downs and 116 yards in total offense.\n\nNobody expects to see a replay when No. 6 Ohio State (2-0) comes to town this weekend.\n\nThe Hoosiers have a little bit of everything.\n\nWestbrook, Hale and Miles Marshall are all big-bodied players who double as deep threats. Philyor and freshmen David Ellis and Sampson James are speedy athletes, capable of electrifying plays. Running back Ronnie Walker Jr. demonstrated his receiving skills with a nifty a 64-yard TD reception Saturday, and the Hoosiers have turned tight end Peyton Hendershot into a bigger weapon in the middle of the field.\n\n\u201cHe (Hendershot) made some really good catches last week, took some hits,\u201d offensive coordinator Kalen DeBoer said. \u201cThis week he was in the right place and caught the ball first. After that he made some guys miss, ran through some tackles and had some third-down conversions.\u201d\n\nSo far, DeBoer\u2019s offense has worked perfectly against Ball State and Eastern Illinois.\n\nNow comes the big test - Ohio State, a team the Hoosiers haven\u2019t beaten since 1988 - and Penix thinks he can pass by following the script.\n\n\u201cMike doesn\u2019t have the one main guy. He thinks anybody can make a play for him,\u201d Hendershot said. \u201cI just like us all getting the ball. It makes it easier.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Indiana quarterback Michael Penix Jr. is still getting acclimated to his new job.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/e_illinois_indiana_football_58398_c0-172-3000-1921_s1770x1032.jpg?13092784dff4e53807a4960a7a8b145b195b5102", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
