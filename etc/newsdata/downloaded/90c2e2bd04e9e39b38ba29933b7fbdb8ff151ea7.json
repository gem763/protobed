This means the Pentagon will have to disassemble combat bases and other infrastructure that were built to stay for a mission that was supposed to last, all while protecting the troops as they withdraw amid a chaotic battlefield.\n\nWhere did U.S. troops operate before the Turkish offensive?\n\nBefore the Turkish offensive, American troops, mostly Special Operations forces, operated in an archipelago of about a dozen bases and outposts across northeastern Syria, mostly living alongside their Syrian Kurdish partners. They were divided into two main headquarters, known by their cardinal directions, East and West.\n\nThe outposts are often a mixture of blast-resistant walls known as Hesco barriers, rudimentary structures and all-weather tents. The large air base in the city of Kobani is replete with a small tent city and some container housing units.\n\nThe western headquarters, known as Advanced Operational Base West, oversaw roughly half a dozen smaller outposts that covered cities like Manbij and Raqqa. Roughly 500 troops are dedicated to the area overseen by AOB West.\n\nThe eastern headquarters, known as AOB East, is closer to the Iraqi border and helps monitor some of the roughly 500 troops in that area around the Euphrates River Valley, with several smaller outposts around Deir el-Zour and some near the Iraq-Syria border in towns like Bukamal and Hajin. The number of forces in the east, however, is fluid, as units frequently move between Syria and Iraq.\n\nWhere are those troops moving now?\n\nAs the troops withdraw, they first will collapse inward by abandoning the outposts closest to the line of advancing foreign troops, in this case the Turkish military and its ill-disciplined Syrian militia proxies, along with Russian and Syrian regime forces. That strategy was made clear in a video posted online Tuesday, showing a Russian journalist standing in an abandoned American outpost west of Manbij and closest to Syrian government troops.\n\nCol. Myles Caggins, a spokesman for the American-led coalition based in Baghdad, confirmed in a Tuesday message on Twitter, \u201cWe are out of Manbij.\u201d\n\nThe troops are likely to be repositioned to Iraq or potentially to Jordan. Some may return to the United States, officials said.\n\nWhat routes will the troops use in exiting Syria?\n\nThe western and eastern headquarters are likely to withdraw independently of each other. In the west, American forces will, according to American military officials, most likely leave through the Kobani airfield, known as the Kobani Landing Zone. That base, with its long dirt runaway, can support C-17 transport aircraft and has a large Air Force contingent of maintenance staff. In the east, those forces will most likely exit overland and into Iraq in convoys, with some traveling via helicopter airlift.\n\nAre there risks in the withdrawal?\n\nThe risk of confrontation with the medley of different ground forces \u2014 both state-led and proxy \u2014 is undoubtedly higher than it was several weeks ago.\n\nConvoys moving through contested territory and aircraft making repeated landings all might contribute to an accidental confrontation or a staged attack, especially from any Islamic State leftovers that might want to take advantage of the sudden withdrawal.\n\nOne of the biggest risks to the remaining American troops as they pull back will most likely be attacks from Turkish-backed Syrian militia called the Free Syrian Army, which has spearheaded the Turkish offensive in many places along the border. Those troops are supported by Turkish army artillery and mortar fire, and Turkish air force strikes.\n\nAmerican officials say these Turkish-backed militia are less disciplined than regular Turkish soldiers, and deliberately or inadvertently have fired on retreating American troops. Another emerging threat comes from Islamic State fighters, who had gone underground after the defeat of the final shards of the terror group\u2019s caliphate, or religious state, in northern Syria earlier this year.", "description": "President Donald Trump's decision -- made in the span of a week -- to withdraw about 1,000 American troops from northern Syria caught the Pentagon, and the forces on the ground, off guard.To carry out the \"endless wars\" since Sept. 11, 2001, which Trump has vowed to wrap up, the American", "authors": ["Thomas Gibbons-Neff", "Eric Schmitt"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EbVy1qtf7ZWdA.BAvUymVA--~B/aD0zODQwO3c9NTc2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/223b4d436994a3f1111aaff7d98b11b4", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
