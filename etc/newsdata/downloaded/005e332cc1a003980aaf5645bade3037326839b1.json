REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File Photo\n\nHuman Rights Watch said in a separate report Friday that authorities had arbitrarily detained and deported dozens of Syrians to northern Syria between January and September.\n\nTurkey currently hosts some 3.6 million refugees who fled Syria\u2019s eight-year-long civil war. But, with Turkish public sentiment towards them souring, Ankara hopes to resettle up to two million in the planned safe zone in northeast Syria.\n\nAnkara says more than 350,000 Syrian refugees have already voluntarily returned to their country.\n\nIn its report, Amnesty said refugees it had spoken to complained of being threatened or physically forced by Turkish police to sign documents stating that they were voluntarily returning to Syria.\n\n\u201cIn reality, Turkey put the lives of Syrian refugees under serious danger by forcing them to return to a war zone,\u201d the British-based human rights group said.\n\nAmnesty said it believed the number of forced returns in recent months to be in the hundreds, based on interviews it conducted between July and October, but said it was able to confirm 20 cases.\n\nSyrians who are deported are generally told they are not registered or live outside the Turkish province in which they are registered, the report said, adding that people were also deported from provinces in which they had been registered.\n\nAnna Shea, Amnesty\u2019s Researcher on Refugee and Migrant Rights, said Turkey deserved recognition for hosting so many Syrians over many years, \u201cbut it cannot use this generosity as an excuse to flout international and domestic law by deporting people to an active conflict zone.\u201d\n\n\u201cFALSE AND IMAGINARY\u201d\n\nThe Turkish foreign ministry said later on Friday that Turkey was fulfilling all of its responsibilities towards the refugees in accordance with international laws.\n\n\u201cThe claims in the report about Syrians being forcibly sent back, threatened and mistreated are false and imaginary,\u201d said Hami Aksoy, the foreign ministry\u2019s spokesman.\n\n\u201cOur country is reiterating at every opportunity that the return of migrants needs to be done voluntarily and safely, and that this process must be carried out in line with international laws,\u201d Aksoy said in a statement.\n\nA plan agreed between Turkey and Russia this week envisages Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters being removed from a 30 km (19 mile) strip of territory along the Turkish border and refugees being allowed to return there \u201cin a safe and voluntary manner\u201d.\n\nAddressing world leaders at the United Nations in September, President Tayyip Erdogan set out ambitious proposals to build dozens of new villages and towns in the planned safe zone.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A demonstrator holds a placard during a protest against Turkish government's recent refugee policies in Istanbul, Turkey, August 2, 2019. REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File Photo\n\nPro-government newspaper Yeni Safak said on Friday that life would \u201cnormalize\u201d in the Syrian border towns of Tel Abyad and Ras Al Ain now that Turkey has taken control of the area.\n\nIt said Turkey would reconstruct the two towns ravaged by years of war, establish security forces and a judiciary there and work to bring economic stability to the region.\n\nAksoy said the international community needed to be more active in facilitating the safe return of refugees to the zone.", "description": "Turkey is forcibly sending Syrian refugees to an area of Syria near the border where it aims to set up a \"safe zone\" even though the conflict there has not ended, Amnesty International said in a report published on Friday.", "authors": ["Ali Kucukgocmen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444984340&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0GK", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
