For all the excitement that followed the storming win over Scotland, raising suggestions that the Irish were back on track, the loss in Shizuoka brought Joe Schmidt\u2019s men crashing back to reality.\n\nHowever, to call the result a \u2018shock\u2019 is to do a disservice to the Japanese. That defeat may have shaken up Irish rugby and dented the national side\u2019s pride, but the result will not have come as a surprise for the hosts.\n\nThe Brave Blossoms had been preparing for last week\u2019s showdown since the pools were first confirmed back in 2017. That the evening ended with a spectacular fireworks display, prepared on the off-chance of victory, demonstrated the extent to which they quietly believed themselves capable of an upset.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Because, in truth, Schmidt\u2019s side were left blind-sided by their opponents. After pulling ahead through Garry Ringrose and Rob Kearney, their tries delivered in the early stages of the first half, Ireland took their foot off the pedal, allowing Japan to hit back. Unable to cope with their opponents intensity and ferocity, the Irish wilted.\n\nSchmidt admitted as much speaking yesterday in Kobe. \u201cWe converted two tries on the back of some really good line breaks and maybe that was to our detriment because we kind of stepped back after that and didn\u2019t play with the same front foot,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford to do that against a quality opposition.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Rugby World Cup team of round two 1/15 1, Ellis Genge (England) The loosehead prop may have only come on for England at half-time, but there had not been a run at the World Cup from a prop quite like what Genge produced against the USA. A barn-storming run saw him outpace one defender and trample over another, breaking the best part of 50 metres before it took two men to stop him. He was also excellent in the scrum to win countless penalties as the USA wilted. AP 2/15 2. Julian Montoya (Argentina) It takes something special to shine in Agustin Creevy\u2019s absence, but Montoya delivered with an excellent hat-trick to help lead Argentina to victory over Tonga. Montoya was smart to stay wide following a lineout for his first try, was the beneficiary of the rolling maul for the second and powered his way over from close range for a classy 26-minute hat-trick. AP 3/15 3. Levan Chilachava (Georgia) It\u2019s not often a Georgian makes the team of the round, but Chilachava lead an inspired Georgian pack to dominate Uruguay in their Sunday clash, scoring a try in the bonus-point victory and monstering the opposition front row in the scrum.

Lood de Jager (South Africa) The Springbok needed a big performance to strengthen his case for selection in what is a very competitive area for South Africa, and the giant second row delivered emphatically with a man-of-the-match performance. He may not have got on the scoresheet, but his impact in destroying Namibia\u2019s gameplan was standout nonetheless. AP 6/15 6. Aaron Wainwright (Wales) A young player whose development at the World Cup is really turning heads. Wainwright did not look out of place up against one of the greats of the game against David Pocock, and it was his ball-carrying ability that really stood out in an eye-catching performance. Getty Images 7/15 7. Lewis Ludlam (England) A remarkable rise to prominence saw Ludlam score his first World Cup try for England in the demolition of the USA, but it was his all-round performance last week that earns him his place in the side. From nowhere, Ludlam is emerging as a very important member of the England team. AFP/Getty Images 8/15 8.

Gareth Davies (Wales) Australia could not keep Davies out of the game in Tokyo, with the scrum-half twice intercepting Will Genia and Bernard Foley and nearly bagging himself a third in the second half. He was also excellent at injecting pace into the game and tried to catch the defence napping throughout. Getty Images 10/15 10. Felipe Berchesi (Uruguay) The Uruguayan was excellent in Uruguay\u2019s victory over Fiji, with the South American\u2019s forced to double-up across the round by playing Georgia a handful of days later. Berchesi had to make do with a team on the back foot more often than not, yet managed to release his outside backs to run Fiji ragged. AFP/Getty Images 11/15 11. Makazole Mapimpi (South Africa) Mapimpi emerged from the shadow of Cheslin Kolbe to star in South Africa\u2019s rout of Namibia, scoring two tries to trigger the landslide victory. Mapimpi may not get the shower of praise that his elusive teammate receives, but he showed how dangerous he can be with the ball in hand, showing a devastating turn of pace backed up by some serious power.

AP\n\nAlthough Russia don\u2019t perhaps qualify as \u201cquality opposition\u201d \u2013 the Bears are the only team in Pool A yet to pick up a point \u2013 Schdmit will know that his side needs to deliver a response. In the same way that Scotland hit back against Samoa after that farce of a defeat in Yokohama, it\u2019s time the men in green followed suit.\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be easy, though. The Irish are facing a tough six-day turnaround from the Japan loss, followed by a five-day gap before taking on Samoa, with the need to secure two bonus points of paramount importance. Unsurprisingly, Schmidt has rung the changes, making 11 in total for tomorrow\u2019s clash. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a bit of attrition,\u201d the Kiwi added. \u201cWe do need to make sure everyone is ready and involved as much as possible, to get everyone up to speed. We\u2019re looking to freshen it up and give guys an opportunity.\u201d\n\nAnd with two physical, ugly scraps set to come, the sort that might deprive Ireland the opportunity to deploy the free-flowing, fluid rugby we know they\u2019re capable of, Schmidt will no doubt be anxious to avoid any further injuries to his men.\n\nJack Conan was sent home last week after fracturing a bone in his foot, with Jordi Murphy called up to replace the Ulster back row. Robbie Henshaw remains absent from Thursday\u2019s team sheet \u2013 the centre has yet to feature in Japan after injuring a hamstring in training \u2013 while Chris Farrell is unavailable due to concussion. Another injury will only add to the quiet sense of concern that has been allowed to creep in.\n\nAlthough Ireland are expected to comfortably beat their Russian opponents, it\u2019s the manner in which they do so which will be of significance. \u201cWe have to stay around our performance-orientated goals,\u201d Schmidt said. That means learning from the Japan loss, whether it\u2019s maintaining focus and intensity levels or ironing out those sloppy set-piece mistakes.\n\nBecause while the Bears are realistic of what awaits in Kobe, that won\u2019t stop them from attempting to drag down the Irish. \u201cOur goal is to be competitive, maybe give Ireland a bit of a scare for a bit,\u201d said Russia forwards coach Mark McDermott. For all the introspection and scrutiny that followed last week\u2019s upset, Schmidt will know that another fright is the last thing his men need.", "description": "The question for Ireland, after what can only be described as one of the most humbling\u00a0World Cup defeats in their history, is this: have they learned their lesson?
