We're actually growing still.\"\n\nFinke's comments come amid worries that Washington's trade war with Beijing could drive the U.S. economy into a downturn, with the two powerhouses slapping tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods.\n\nThe data so far has been mixed. In August, the Institute for Supply Management's Purchasing Managers' Index contracted for the first time in three years, and nonfarm payrolls for that month fell short of estimates. On the other hand, the September print of preliminary data released by the University of Michigan showed consumer confidence stateside rising more than expected.", "description": "U.S. consumers and growth in sectors such as technology have offset declines in other American industries, says Tom Finke, chairman and CEO of investment management firm Barings.", "authors": ["Eustance Huang"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106084967-1566128169873gettyimages-1151712688.jpeg?v=1568863845", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
