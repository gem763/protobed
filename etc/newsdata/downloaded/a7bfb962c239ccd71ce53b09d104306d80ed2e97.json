It\u2019s hard to believe that someone did not get killed making this movie.\n\nViewers using the included digital code to watch the movie on iTunes will also find an extra 3-minute, too-quick analysis on select action scenes by fight and stunt coordinator Jonathan Eusebio. He covers the choreography that mixes jiu-jitsu, gun-fu, judo, karate, kung fu, and throwing knives.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that owners will need to download the Lionsgate app on their phone to get the code in a process that is cumbersome and a total time waster. Just give viewers a physical code on a piece of paper that they can type in and be done with it.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
