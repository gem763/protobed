It\u2019s decimated. Apocalyptic,\u201d said Lia Head-Rigby, who helps run a local hurricane relief group and flew over the Bahamas\u2019 hard-hit Abaco Islands. \u201cIt\u2019s not rebuilding something that was there; we have to start again.\u201d\n\nShe said her representative on Abaco told her there were \u201ca lot more dead,\u201d though she had no numbers as bodies being gathered.\n\nThe Bahamas\u2019 prime minister also expected more deaths and predicted that rebuilding would require \u201ca massive, coordinated effort.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in the midst of one of the greatest national crises in our country\u2019s history,\u201d Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said at a news conference. \u201cNo effort or resources will be held back.\u201d\n\nFive Coast Guard helicopters ran near-hourly flights to the stricken Abaco, flying more than 20 injured people to the capital\u2019s main hospital. British sailors were also rushing in aid. A few private aid groups also tried to reach the battered islands in the northern Bahamas.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want people thinking we\u2019ve forgotten them. \u2026 We know what your conditions are,\u201d Tammy Mitchell of the Bahamas\u2019 National Emergency Management Agency told ZNS Bahamas radio station.\n\nWith their heads bowed against heavy wind and rain, rescuers began evacuating people from the storm\u2019s aftermath across Grand Bahama island late Tuesday, using jet skis, boats and even a huge bulldozer that cradled children and adults in its digger as it churned through deep waters and carried them to safety.\n\nOne rescuer gently scooped up an elderly man in his arms and walked toward a pickup truck waiting to evacuate him and others to higher ground.\n\nOver 2 million people along the coast in Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina were warned to evacuate. While the threat of a direct hit on Florida had all but evaporated, Dorian was expected to pass dangerously close to Georgia and South Carolina \u2014 and perhaps strike North Carolina \u2014 on Thursday or Friday. The hurricane\u2019s eye passed to the east of Cape Canaveral, Florida, early Wednesday.\n\nEven if landfall does not occur, the system is likely to cause storm surge and severe flooding, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tough it out. Get out,\u201d said U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency official Carlos Castillo.\n\nIn the Bahamas, Red Cross spokesman Matthew Cochrane said more than 13,000 houses, or about 45% of the homes on Grand Bahama and Abaco, were believed to be severely damaged or destroyed. U.N. officials said more than 60,000 people on the hard-hit islands will need food, and the Red Cross said some 62,000 will need clean drinking water.\n\n\u201cWhat we are hearing lends credence to the fact that this has been a catastrophic storm and a catastrophic impact,\u201d Cochrane said.\n\nLawson Bates, a staffer for Arkansas-based MedicCorps, flew over Abaco and said: \u201cIt looks completely flattened. There\u2019s boats way inland that are flipped over. It\u2019s total devastation.\u201d\n\nThe Red Cross authorized $500,000 for the first wave of disaster relief, Cochrane said. U.N. humanitarian teams stood ready to go into the stricken areas to help assess damage and the country\u2019s needs, U.N. spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said. The U.S. government also sent a disaster response team.\n\nAbaco and Grand Bahama islands, with a combined population of about 70,000, are known for their marinas, golf courses and all-inclusive resorts. To the south, the Bahamas\u2019 most populous island, New Providence, which includes the capital city of Nassau and has over a quarter-million people, had little damage.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard airlifted at least 21 people injured on Abaco. Choppy, coffee-colored floodwaters reached roofs and the tops of palm trees.\n\n\u201cWe will confirm what the real situation is on the ground,\u201d Health Minister Duane Sands said. \u201cWe are hoping and praying that the loss of life is limited.\u201d\n\nSands said Dorian rendered the main hospital on Grand Bahama unusable, while the hospital at Marsh Harbor on Abaco was in need of food, water, medicine and surgical supplies. He said crews were trying to fly out five to seven kidney failure patients from Abaco who had not received dialysis since Friday.\n\nThe Grand Bahama airport was under 6 feet (2 meters) of water.\n\nLate Tuesday, Dorian was centered about 95 miles (155 kilometers) east of Cape Canaveral, Florida, and it was moving northwest at 6 mph (9 kph). Hurricane-force winds extended up to 60 miles (95 kilometers) from its center, while tropical storm-force winds could be felt up to 175 miles (280 kilometers) from the core.\n\nThe U.S. coast from north of West Palm Beach, Florida, through Georgia was expected to get 3 to 6 inches of rain, with 9 inches in places, while the Carolinas could get 5 to 10 inches and 15 in spots, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nNASA satellite imagery through Monday night showed some places in the Bahamas had gotten as much as 35 inches (89 centimeters) of rain, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue.\n\nParliament member Iram Lewis said he feared waters would keep rising and stranded people would lose contact with officials as their cellphone batteries died.\n\nDorian also left one person dead in its wake in Puerto Rico before slamming into the Bahamas on Sunday. It tied the record for the strongest Atlantic storm ever to hit land, matching the Labor Day hurricane that struck Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast in 1935, before storms were given names.\n\nAcross the Southeast, interstate highways leading away from beaches in South Carolina and Georgia were turned into one-way evacuation routes. Several airports announced closings, and hundreds of flights were canceled. Walt Disney World in Orlando closed in the afternoon, and SeaWorld shut down.\n\nPolice in coastal Savannah, Georgia, announced an overnight curfew. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper ordered a mandatory evacuation of the dangerously exposed barrier islands along the state\u2019s entire coast.\n\nHaving seen storms swamp his home on the Georgia coast in 2016 and 2017, Joey Spalding of Tybee Island decided to empty his house and stay at a friend\u2019s apartment nearby rather than take any chances with Dorian.\n\nHe packed a U-Haul truck with tables, chairs, a chest of drawers, tools \u2014 virtually all of his furnishings except for his mattress and a large TV \u2014 and planned to park it on higher ground. He also planned to shroud his house in plastic wrap up to shoulder height and pile sandbags in front of the doors.\n\n\u201cIn this case, I don\u2019t have to come into a house full of junk,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m learning a little as I go.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalist Ramon Espinosa reported this story in Freeport, AP writer Danica Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and AP writer Michael Weissenstein reported from Nassau, Bahamas.
