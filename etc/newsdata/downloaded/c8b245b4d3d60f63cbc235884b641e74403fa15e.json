REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Boris Johnson urged French President Emanuel Macron to \u201cpush forward\u201d to secure a Brexit deal and told him the EU should not be lured into the mistaken belief that the UK would stay in the bloc after Oct.31, the British prime minister\u2019s office said.\n\nJohnson discussed his Brexit proposal, which has received a cool reception in Brussels, with Macron and Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThis is the chance to get a deal done: a deal that is backed by parliamentarians and a deal which involves compromise on all sides,\u201d a senior British government source said on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe UK has made a big, important offer but it\u2019s time for the Commission to show a willingness to compromise too. If not the UK will leave with no deal.\u201d\n\nWith the Oct. 31 deadline approaching, Johnson has consistently said he will not ask for another delay to Brexit, but also when asked about legislation that forces him to request one if no withdrawal deal has been agreed by Oct. 19., he has said he will not break the law.\n\nHe has not explained the apparent contradiction in his comments.\n\nWith just 24 days before the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU, the future of Brexit, its most significant geopolitical move since World War Two, is uncertain. It could leave with a deal or without one - or not leave at all.\n\nBoth sides are positioning themselves to avoid blame for a delay or a disorderly no-deal Brexit.", "description": "Boris Johnson urged French President Emanuel Macron to \"push forward\" to secure a Brexit deal and told him the EU should not be lured into the mistaken belief that the UK would stay in the bloc after Oct.31, the British prime minister's office said.", "authors": ["Paul Sandle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437978953&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF950PP", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
