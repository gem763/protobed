Areas with outages marked in purple. On Wednesday PG&E canceled deliberate power shutoffs for customers in Alameda, Contra Costa, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, and San Mateo counties as the weather had improved in those areas\n\nMillions of people have been without power for days as fire crews raced to contain two major wind-whipped blazes that have destroyed dozens of homes at both ends of the state: the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County wine country and the Getty Fire in the hills of Los Angeles.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon PG&E was given given the 'all clear' to begin inspections for restoring power to locations affected by the safety power shutoffs. The company said they\u2019d don\u2019t anticipate another wind event \u2013 like the dangerous Santa Ana 'Devil winds' that whipped through the area last night \u2013 that would cause another preventative outage.\n\nKern County is expected to be given the all clear for inspections by Thursday morning.The areas of the Bay still left in the dark include the North Bay, specifically Sonoma, Napa and Solano counties.\n\nPG&E announced that as of Tuesday night they found 55 instances of damage to their equipment statewide.\n\nCustomers can check for power shutoffs in their area here.\n\nOn Tuesday PG&E said it continued to restore power to residents, even as it began de-energizing other customers, as part of the third intentional blackout in a week, as per the SFGate.\n\nChef and caterer Jane Sykes fumed on Tuesday when she realized she would have to throw out $1,000 worth of food, including trays of brownies, cupcakes and puff pastry.\n\n'I don\u2019t think PG&E really thought this through,' she said adding without electricity she couldn't run the machine she relies on for sleep for her apnea.\n\nAcross Northern California, people worried about charging cellphones and electric vehicles, finding gasoline and cash, staying warm and keeping their food from spoiling. They donned headlamps at home and parked their cars outside inoperable automatic garage doors.\n\nOakland police officers in a cruiser stay alert in the Montclair shopping district during the PG&E power outage on October 10\n\nFirefighters look on as a structure burns during the Kincade fire off Highway 128, east of Healdsburg, California on Tuesday\n\nSome ended up at centers set up by PG&E where people could go to power their electronics and get free water, snacks, flashlights and solar lanterns.\n\n'There\u2019s a hidden cost. Absolutely public safety above all else, but there\u2019s a big financial loss for my profession, having to throw away a lot of hard work,' Skye said.\n\nBy 5pm about 435,000 customers \u2014 or nearly 1.1 million people \u2014 were without electricity as restorations were made from Sunday\u2019s shut-off and new outages continued from Tuesday\u2019s wind event, the utility said.\n\nThe outages have made people like Linda Waldron, a mother of two who lives north of San Francisco in San Rafael, realize the things we take for granted.\n\nShe discovered she was low on gas and began to panic as she drove around looking for an open gas station. She wound up driving to San Francisco, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away, before she found one. She also stocked up on cash after realizing she had only $1 in her wallet.\n\n'What if we needed to evacuate and I had no gas in the car?' she said as her 5-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son cavorted at a playground.'I didn\u2019t even think about gas and cash because I\u2019m too busy with these guys.'\n\nIn Placer County, Angel Smith relied on baby wipes and blankets to keep her 13-month-old son Liam warm and clean. The family has been without power since Saturday night and cannot draw well water without electricity.\n\nShe ran a cord from her neighbors\u2019 generator to keep her phone and tablet charged so the two could watch movies. Temperatures were expected to drop below freezing overnight in parts of Northern California.\n\n'The hardest part about this for me has been making sure I keep my son warm as it gets cold here,' Smith said.\n\nIn the blackouts this Target in Novato, California was forced to shut down. The emptied refrigerator shelves pictured above\n\nIn Mendocino County, officials say they are struggling to keep the public informed because they can\u2019t trust the information they\u2019re getting from PG&E.\n\n'The issue isn\u2019t even all of the power shutoffs. It\u2019s the lack of communication. It\u2019s letting people think they\u2019re getting their power back,' Carmel Angelo, the county\u2019s chief executive, said.\n\nAfter the weekend shut-off, some people were led to believe the power would come back Monday and that the next round of outages would avoid Mendocino\u2019s most populous areas. But Angelo said she learned Tuesday that the outage was still in effect because of two damaged transmission lines dozens of miles away in Marin County.\n\nIf people knew the lights would be out for a week they could\u2019ve planned accordingly, she said. It\u2019s been especially troublesome for those who need oxygen. Some of the trucks that resupply oxygen have been caught in long delays for gas, and some patients have been admitted to the emergency room as a precaution, she said.\n\nMendocino residents Suzanne Lemley Schein and her husband, Glenn, lost power on Saturday and have been spending the time since playing backgammon by candlelight and going to bed early.\n\nThey haven\u2019t been able to rent out a studio on their property, or even offer it to wildfire evacuees, because it has no power or water.\n\nShe said she doesn\u2019t like 'the power that PG&E has over all of us,' she said. 'This has crippled us in a lot of ways.'\n\nSykes, the caterer, is among some people in well-to-do Marin County, north of San Francisco, who have been without power since Saturday.\n\nShe lives in San Rafael but works in San Francisco, so she has 'civilization during the day,' but she said it is eerie to drive along darkened highways. She hasn\u2019t opened her freezer since the outage and is not looking forward to it.\n\n'I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not going to be salvageable,' she said.\n\nPG&E, which is in bankruptcy after its equipment was blamed for a string of disastrous fires over the past three years, including a blaze that all but destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people, has said its foremost concern is public safety.\n\nPG&E workers pictured standing near a tunnel earlier this month in Oakland. The utility has come under fire for cutting more to more than half a million customers in Northern California this week to prevent wildfires\n\nBut Gov. Gavin Newsom and top utility regulators have accused the company of mismanaging its power system and failing for decades to make the investments needed to ensure it\u2019s more durable. He and others have also complained that the utility has botched the outages by not keeping the public adequately informed.\n\nPG&E Corp. President Bill Johnson says he talked to Newsom Tuesday and told him he agreed with his suggestion that the company give credits to customers who\u2019ve been hit by pre-emptive power shut-offs. Newsom had suggested $100 per household, or $250 per business. Johnson did not confirm a figure, saying only, 'We agree with his suggestion. As to how that gets done, the mechanics, we\u2019ll settle that when we get through this.'\n\nPG&E said Monday its power lines may have started two smaller wildfires over the weekend in a part of the San Francisco Bay Area, where the utility had kept the lights on because it was not designated a high fire risk.\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission plans to open an investigation that could result in fines against PG&E.\n\nThe commission said it also plans to review the rules governing blackouts, will look to prevent utilities from charging customers when the power is off and will convene experts to find grid improvements that might lessen shut-offs next fire season.\n\nThe state can\u2019t continue experiencing such widespread blackouts, 'nor should Californians be subject to the poor execution that PG&E in particular has exhibited,' PUC President Marybel Batjer said in a statement.", "description": "Northern California residents have been left outraged after a fourth day of no electricity on Tuesday as the state's\u00a0biggest utility began a third round of widespread blackouts.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/16/20385880-0-image-a-34_1572452582453.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
