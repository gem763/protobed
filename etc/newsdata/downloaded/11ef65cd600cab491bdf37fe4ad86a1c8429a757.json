REUTERS/Ali Hashisho\n\nLebanon\u2019s highest Christian Maronite authority and a prominent Druze politician threw their weight behind the groundswell for change, calling for qualified technocrats to be included in any government shake-up.\n\nWith a population of 6 million people including around 1 million Syrian refugees, Lebanon has been swept by protests against politicians blamed for corruption and waste in a state mired in debt and economic crisis.\n\nFlag-waving protesters kept roads blocked with vehicles and makeshift barricades for a seventh day on Wednesday. Banks have been closed since Friday and will remain shut on Thursday, the banking association said. Schools are also closed.\n\nSoldiers scuffled with demonstrators as they struggled to unblock main roads.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re staying in the streets until the looted public funds are restored, until the government falls,\u201d said Heba Haidar, protesting at a makeshift barricade of empty trash containers and steel rods in Beirut.\n\nPrime Minister Saad al-Hariri\u2019s government announced an emergency reform package on Monday, to try to assuage public anger and steer the state away from a looming financial crisis.\n\nHariri\u2019s government, which took office at the start of the year, groups nearly all of the main parties in a sectarian power-sharing system.\n\nThe idea of a reshuffle \u201cis being discussed widely among politicians in the country and we might get there if the protests remain in the street in the coming days\u201d, a senior political source said.\n\nAnother political source said the idea was \u201cstarting to mature\u201d. \u201cThe street is imposing its rhythm on the political class,\u201d he added.\n\nA third political source, asked about a reshuffle, said: \u201cEverything is being discussed in a calm manner.\u201d\n\nThe sources spoke on condition of anonymity as the consultations have not been made public.\n\n\u201cTHE PEOPLE\u2019S DEMANDS\u201d\n\nMaronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai, speaking alongside other top church leaders, said the measures announced by Hariri were a \u201cpositive first step\u201d but also required replacing current ministers with skilled technocrats.\n\n\u201cWe call on the president of the republic ... to immediately begin consultations with the political leadership and the heads of the sects to take the necessary decisions regarding the people\u2019s demands,\u201d he said.\n\nDruze politician Walid Jumblatt said he backed the idea of a reshuffle. \u201cA major reshuffle of the government could satisfy some of the demonstrators\u2019 demands,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nLebanon\u2019s unrest is the latest in a flare-up of protests around the world - from Hong Kong and Barcelona to Quito and Santiago - each having its own trigger but sharing some underlying frustrations.\n\n\u201cWe need to stay strong,\u201d said Manal Ghanem, a university graduate who works at a coffee shop, as she stood by a barricade in Beirut.\n\nMohammad Jana, 36, an unemployed chef at a roadblock on a main highway, said future generations were inheriting massive public debt. \u201cThey are stealing.

Hard currency has become hard to obtain at the official exchange rate and a parallel market has emerged.\n\nParliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Shi\u2019ite Muslim, said Lebanon could not remain in such chaos and he feared any power vacuum.\n\nThe government measures included halving ministers\u2019 salaries and steps towards implementing long-delayed reforms needed to fix the state finances.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\nUnder pressure to reduce the budget deficit, Hariri has said the central bank and commercial banks would contribute 5.1 trillion Lebanese pounds ($3.4 billion) to help plug the gap in 2020, including through an increase in taxes on bank profits.\n\nBut Moody\u2019s warned that confidence in the government\u2019s ability to service debt could be further undermined through its plan to force banks to accept a lower interest rate on its debt.\n\nHariri met Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh and a delegation from the Association of Banks in Lebanon.", "description": "Lebanese leaders are discussing a possible government reshuffle, sources said on Wednesday, to defuse unprecedented protests against the political elite that have paralysed the country for a week.", "authors": ["Ellen Francis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444158874&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1HL", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
