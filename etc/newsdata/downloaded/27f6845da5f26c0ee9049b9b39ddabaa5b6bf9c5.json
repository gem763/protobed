While there was some $17 trillion in bonds trading at negative yields in September, that\u2019s now fallen to around $13 trillion, according to the World Gold Council.\n\nBy 11:30 AM ET (1530 GMT) for delivery on the COMEX exchange were down 0.3% at $1,491.60 a troy ounce, while was down 0.2% at $1,489.23.\n\nwere off 0.2% at $17.85 an ounce, while were 0.5% higher at $923.10.\n\nWith the market already for an interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy meeting ends on Wednesday, the risks for gold are arguably skewed to the downside \u2013 especially if Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s guidance leaves doubt about the future path of rates.\n\nPowell has said repeatedly that the high level of uncertainty emanating from issues such as the trade dispute with China, or the risk of a disorderly Brexit, had been the main factor holding back the U.S. economy over the summer.\n\nBut with a partial trade truce with China reportedly nearing completion and with the EU having granted the U.K. another three-month extension, near-term risks appear to have abated for now \u2013 even if the most recent batch of economic data have been underwhelming. The October U.S. index fell to its lowest level since June, according to data out of the Conference Board on Tuesday, while the Dallas Fed\u2019s index of activity slipped back into recessionary territory in October and companies sharply lowered their outlooks.\n\nAlistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the World Gold Council, argues that the global outlook for gold is still supported by the outlook for monetary policy. A total of 54 central banks have cut their rates so far this year, he pointed out in a blog post on Tuesday. Among those cutting last week were three of the world\u2019s largest emerging economies: Russia, Turkey and Indonesia.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, more central bank interest rate cuts are likely, further supporting investor interest in gold,\u201d Hewitt said.", "description": "Gold Prices Fall Again as Traders Trim Bets Ahead of Fed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED1M0ED_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
