The Hall of Fame quarterback is telling potential buyers to sell on the idea of signing the wide receiver.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nBrown\u2019s trials and tribulations over the past few months have ranged from a reported physical altercation with Oakland Raiders General Manager Mike Mayock to allegations of rape and a looming civil lawsuit. Perhaps the most glaring of red flags to future NFL suitors, that the New England Patriots cut him last week, underscores that there is a liability attached to Brown\u2019s name.\n\nTheismann was asked by TMZ if he, as a former quarterback, would welcome the four-time All-Pro wide receiver into his locker room, knowing full well the baggage that is included.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to be on a team with him, simply because a lot of questions that I would be asked during the course of a week would be about him,\u201d Theismann told TMZ.\n\n\u201cIt becomes a distraction to be perfectly honest with you. He has issues that he\u2019s dealing with, he\u2019s been on three football teams right now. You don\u2019t know if he\u2019s ever going to be available to you for any extended period of time. There\u2019s no question that he has the ability to catch and run with the football, he does unbelievable things with the football in his hand. There's so much that's going on around his life that it just makes it really tough to say 'I just want to go to work every day and worry about myself.'\u201d\n\nPlenty of teams could use a wide receiver, including Theismann\u2019s former team, the Washington Redskins. The cost and risk might simply not be worth it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Brown jettisoned from three NFL teams over the course of this calendar year, and his agent claiming interest from several others, Theismann doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s a good investment for any team in the wide receiver.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who you need, I don\u2019t care what you need,\u201d Theismann said. \u201cThe answer would not come up with Antonio Brown. You can give me multiple choice on anyone you want. The one that would not come up Antonio Brown.\u201d", "description": "Joe Theismann doesn't think NFL teams should be interested in the star wide receiver, who is currently beset by legal issues.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/antonio-brown-AP-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
