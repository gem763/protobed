This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS,\u201d Graham wrote on Twitter, using an acronym for the Islamic State group.\n\nFaced with harsh rebukes, the mogul-turned-president \u2014 already under pressure in an impeachment inquiry \u2014 has sent mixed messages and threatened at the White House Wednesday to \u201cwipe out\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if Ankara\u2019s assault was not carried out \u201cin as humane a way as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf (Erdogan) does it unfairly, he is going to pay a big economic price,\u201d Trump told reporters, adding that he\u2019d \u201cdo far more than sanctions.\u201d\n\nBut he also distanced himself from Graham, saying that the hawkish senator \u201cwould like us to stay there for the next 200 years.\u201d\n\nDemocrats also roundly criticized Trump as abandoning allies, even though some agreed that US troops should leave.\n\n\u201cThese sanctions will have immediate, far-reaching consequences for Erdogan and his military,\u201d said Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat who teamed up with Graham.\n\nTrump signaled tentative support for sanctions but could veto the legislation if it is approved, setting up a showdown with Congress.\n\n\u2013 Erdogan invested in Trump \u2013\n\nGonul Tol, director of the Turkey program at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said that Erdogan was looking primarily at domestic considerations, especially after his party\u2019s humiliating loss in Istanbul local elections.\n\nErdogan links the Kurdish fighters, who head the Syrian Democratic Forces, to separatist militants at home and brands them as \u201cterrorists\u201d \u2014 and is also hoping to send back some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey.\n\nIf Congress goes ahead with sanctions, \u201cthis will mean a new low in Turkish-American relations, and that\u2019s going to be bad news for Erdogan as well because the economy matters a lot to him,\u201d Tol said.\n\nWith Trump known to break diplomatic norms, Erdogan likely sees the US leader as similar to him, with his every word becoming policy, Tol added.\n\n\u201cHe has invested so much in the relationship with President Trump and has complete faith in their chemistry,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cObviously that\u2019s not a wise decision because it completely disregards the role that Congress and other institutions play.\u201d\n\nEven before entering office, Trump enjoyed ties to Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s paramount leader since 2003. In a 2012 encounter drawing fresh scrutiny, the real estate tycoon\u2019s daughter Ivanka thanked Erdogan for attending the opening of Trump Towers Istanbul.\n\n\u2013 Sympathetic Trump in past \u2013\n\nErdogan has seen that Trump can push back against congressional anger in the past.\n\nTurkey has faced limited repercussions, and Trump voiced understanding, after the NATO ally defied the United States to buy Russia\u2019s S-400 air defense system.\n\nBut Trump last year imposed tariffs that threw the Turkish lira into a tailspin as he successfully sought the release of Andrew Brunson, a US pastor whose detention in the Muslim-majority country made him a cause celebre among Trump\u2019s evangelical Christian base.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has proven that he does not want to alienate Erdogan. But when he feels threatened or pushed, he could act otherwise,\u201d Tol said.\n\nErdogan \u201cunderstands that the US can inflict a lot of damage on the Turkish economy. He has seen that,\u201d she said.\n\nNicholas Danforth, an expert on US-Turkey relations at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said Erdogan feels he has a \u201cgood deal of leeway\u201d due to Trump\u2019s ambiguous threats and past hesitation at sanctions.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve also seen Trump change course dramatically,\u201d Danforth said.\n\n\u201cIf Erdogan somehow crosses whatever hard-to-fathom red line exists in Trump\u2019s head, sanctions could come suddenly,\u201d he added.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Turkey on Wednesday faced the threat of US \u201csanctions from hell\u201d as its assault on Syrian Kurdish forces set off a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/c8eb84_smoke-rises-syrian-town-tal-abyad-turkish-bombings-turkey-faces-us-sanctions-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
