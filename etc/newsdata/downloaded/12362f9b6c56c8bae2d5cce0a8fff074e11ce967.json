She said it was after the Patricia de Lille saga that the party then started to dip.\n\n\u201cI think the controversy around my tweets was very unfortunate and was part of creating a difficult context for the DA, yes,\u201d she said, when asked if her tweets had any bearing on the electoral results.\n\n\u201cI think the controversy around my tweets which was in part manufactured outrage, did have a negative effect on the DA. In long-term history, I think I will look back to say I was right to fight these things but short-term history is different,\u201d the former premier said, agreeing that she should have backed down for the good of the party.\n\nPreliminary reports on the party\u2019s poor performance indicated that poor messaging, infighting as well the handling of Zille\u2019s and De Lille\u2019s disciplinary matters were all matters that voters found off-putting.\n\nZille, who has always warned about overreliance on polls, said this week that the party took on a populist approach in conducting its polls.\n\nInternal polls had indicated that the party would garner around 24% to 26% of the national vote, but it ended up at about 21%, declining from the 22% it achieved at the 2015 polls.\n\nwe got \u2018soft ANC\u2019\n\n\u201cNormally we ask questions and then, depending on the response, we don\u2019t change our position on polarising matters but we make the messaging more palatable.\n\n\u201cThis time things changed; we got \u2018soft ANC\u2019 people into a room and polled their feelings and if their beliefs came up to be racial nationalists then we changed our message to be like that. So if they said we hate foreign nationals, we come up with a slogan, \u2018South Africans first\u2019. Where does that come from? It is so against my values.\u201d\n\nOpening up about the unravelling of a succession plan which she helped set in motion when she gave embattled leader Mmusi Maimane the nod for the job, Zille said that she was in part responsible.\n\n\u201cLooking back I don\u2019t regret that I made way for him to lead us into that election season. I don\u2019t regret that I made way for him to lead us to that electoral success at all. But different times require different actions and decisions.\n\n\u201cI did think it was time for the DA to have a black leader because the overwhelming narrative of everyone, our supporters, members, donors, everyone was leading in that direction. But I always knew that you could not put anyone into a key position only because of their colour.\u201d\n\nBeyond being black, she said, the leader had the charisma to drive the party to success in the 2016 polls.\n\nZille said she would not directly become involved in a succession debate again.\n\n\u201cI will not get involved in trying to find a successor ever again, but I don\u2019t want that to come across as if it is a bad reflection on Mmusi, no.\u201d", "description": "Former DA leader Helen Zille has conceded that the row caused by her tweets in May could have contributed to the party\u2019s electoral decline.", "authors": ["S Thembile Cele"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7815/a50a87ba79c645559efca7f151f82d09.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
