This was a weekly gain of 9,742 contracts from the previous week which had a total of 32,032 net contracts.\n\nThis week\u2019s net position was the result of the gross bullish position (longs) rising by just 143 contracts (to a weekly total of 49,626 contracts) while the gross bearish position (shorts) dropped sharply by -9,599 contracts on the week (to a total of 7,852 contracts).\n\nThe US Dollar Index speculators boosted net positions by the largest one-week amount since June 19th of 2018, which is a span of sixty-five weeks. Dollar bets have now gained for ten out of the past twelve weeks and this week\u2019s jump puts the current dollar standing at the most bullish level since April 25th of 2017.\n\nIndividual Currencies Data this week:\n\nIn the other major currency contracts data, we saw three substantial changes (+ or \u2013 10,000 contracts) in the speculators category and three others very close to that level as well this week.\n\nNew Zealand dollar speculator positions did not drop by over 10,000 contracts this week but did manage to hit a record high bearish level at over -36,000 contracts. This eclipses the previous record of -35,412 contracts on October 16th of 2018. The NZD bets have fallen in five out of the last six weeks and have now been in an overall bearish position for twenty-seven consecutive weeks.\n\nEuro positions dropped sharply this week by over -18,000 contracts and fell for a fourth consecutive week. The euro net position is now at the most bearish level since June 11th. Overall, the euro speculative level has been in bearish territory for 51 straight weeks.\n\nAustralian dollar bets improved sharply this week by over +12,000 contracts and have now improved for five straight weeks. The recent rise in sentiment has brought the overall net position to the least bearish level since February 26th.\n\nMexican peso bets dropped this week by over -14,000 net contracts and fell for the sixth time out of the past seven weeks. The peso speculative position has continued on a slow decline in recent weeks and months after reaching an all-time record high of +156,030 contracts on April 16th.\n\nOverall, the major currencies that saw improving speculator positions this week were the US dollar index (9,742 weekly change in contracts), British pound sterling (6,109 contracts), Canadian dollar (8,300 contracts) and the Australian dollar (12,932 contracts).\n\nThe currencies whose speculative bets declined this week were the euro (-18,717 weekly change in contracts), Japanese yen (-8,729 contracts), Swiss franc (-1,664 contracts), New Zealand dollar (-6,253 contracts) and the Mexican peso (-14,011 contracts).\n\nChart: Current Strength of Each Currency compared to their 3-Year Range\n\nCurrent Strength Of Each Currency\n\nSee table and individual currency charts below.\n\nTable of Large Speculator Levels & Weekly Changes:\n\nTable Of Large Speculator Levels & Weekly Changes\n\nThis latest COT data is through Tuesday and shows a quick view of how large speculators or non-commercials (for-profit traders) were positioned in the futures markets. All currency positions are in direct relation to the US dollar where, for example, a bet for the euro is a bet that the euro will rise versus the dollar while a bet against the euro will be a bet that the dollar will gain versus the euro.\n\nWeekly Charts: Large Trader Weekly Positions vs Price\n\nEuroFX:\n\nEuroFX COT Futures Large Trader Positions\n\nThe large speculator standing this week recorded a net position of -68,559 contracts in the data reported through Tuesday.
