This incident has been sensationalized and our officer has been sacrificed in favor of a media spectacle. This comes at a time when our department is already experiencing an unparalleled deterioration in morale and an unprecedented distrust of our leadership. Politically motivated decisions cannot be disguised as transparency. We appreciate the outpouring of support that has been received from our community and around the country.

At the time, the officer took the illegal alien into custody and eventually turned him over to ICE agents.\n\nIn response, Roessler said the decision by the officer was a violation of the agency\u2019s sanctuary policy.\n\n\u201cWhen I learned of this event, I directed an immediate internal investigation to look at all factors in this matter to ensure that all are held accountable for this violation,\u201d Roessler said.\n\nAs Breitbart News has chronicled, Fairfax County has become a central home to the violent MS-13 gang from El Salvador, in part thanks to the generous sanctuary county policy. The gang is made up mostly of illegal aliens from El Salvador who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, posing as unaccompanied minor children.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
