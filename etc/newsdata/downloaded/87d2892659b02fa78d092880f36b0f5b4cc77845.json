USA TODAY\n\nSTUTTGART, Germany -- You cannot do any better than Simone Biles.\n\nNot now, not ever.\n\nMaybe not in any sport.\n\nBiles etched her name more deeply into the record books Sunday, winning the titles on balance beam and floor exercise to make her the most-decorated gymnast, male or female, at the world championships. Her 25 medals are two more than Vitaly Scherbo of Belarus \u2013 who had two more events to collect his, mind you.\n\nOf Biles\u2019 25 medals, a whopping 19 are gold, including every one she won this year: team, all-around, vault, beam and floor. It\u2019s the first time she\u2019s won five golds at worlds, and is sure to spark conversation of whether she can do the same thing at next summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics.\n\nSimone Biles lets her world gymnastics medals speak for themselves.

All of them.\u201d\n\nBiles had tied Scherbo on Saturday after winning the vault title. That she would pass him Sunday was a given, considering she\u2019s the reigning world and Olympic champion on floor and has won a medal on beam at every worlds she\u2019s done.\n\nThat she got the record on beam was extra sweet, because it gave her redemption, too.\n\nBiles had won the beam title at the 2014 and 2015 worlds, and was the favorite for the gold in Rio. But her foot slipped on the landing of a front tuck, and she had to grab the beam to keep from falling off. She still won a bronze medal, but her confidence was shaken.\n\nAnother wobbly performance last year, which also earned her a bronze, only deepened her insecurities.\n\nBut Cecile Landi, who coaches Biles with husband Laurent and is responsible for beam, reworked her routine and helped her regain her faith in herself. She has been as consistent as a metronome at this meet \u2013 no small thing, given how many falls there were, across every phase of the competition.\n\nOn Sunday, she worked the 4-inch-wide beam with swagger, with nary a wobble or bobble on any skill.\n\nWhen her score \u2013 a 15.066 \u2013 popped up, a huge grin spread across Biles\u2019 face and she jumped out of her seat. She threw a roundhouse punch in the air, then exchanged a high-five and hug with Laurent Landi.\n\n\u201cCecile has really been working on bringing my confidence back up to where it used to be on beam, so to go out there and nail the routine just like I do in practice, it felt really good,\u201d Biles said. \u201cI'm thrilled with that performance.\u201d\n\nShe led off her floor exercise with the best triple-twisting, double somersault that she\u2019s done yet, getting huge height and sticking it as if she had glue on her feet. She beamed, and the crowd roared in appreciation.\n\nShe did go out of bounds on the leap that punctuates another pass, but it was a minor deduction.\n\nWhen Biles finished, she didn\u2019t drop the mic as she did at the end of the all-around competition. Instead, she took a moment and then blew kisses while Laurent Landi clapped his hands over his head.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s incredible,\u201d Landi said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to look at (the medals), just. We were here to do the job. The goal is to hit four out of four, every day, day after day. This is what she has shown everybody and to herself, her consistency not only in training but when it counts.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, if she can do this for eight more months, she\u2019ll be very, very successful.\u201d\n\nBiles was already in gymnastics\u2019 G.O.A.T. conversation before the Rio Olympics, and she left there with five medals, four of them gold. When she returned, having taken a year off after the Games, she worried that she had already reached her peak, and wouldn\u2019t be able to duplicate what she did in Rio.\n\nShe has. And then some.\n\nIt\u2019s clear Biles has no peer in gymnastics, having won every all-around competition she\u2019s been in since the 2013 U.S. championships. But she\u2019s now so dominant, the fairer comparisons are with the likes of LeBron James, Serena Williams or Tom Brady.\n\nOr, in Olympic terms, Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt.\n\nTheir sports are different, yes. But their singular achievements, as well as the way they\u2019ve changed their games, are very much the same.\n\nBiles leaves these world championships with two more skills named after her: the triple-double on floor and her double-twisting double somersault dismount off balance beam. The double-double is so difficult the International Gymnastics Federation actually gave it a lesser value than it deserves in order to deter other, less-capable gymnasts from trying it.\n\nBiles now has four skills named after her, two on floor and one each on beam and vault. She\u2019s added all but one in the last year.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve had so much success in the sport, what brings you back in the gym is something original. Some different stuff,\u201d Laurent Landi said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just winning, because it\u2019s hard to motivate yourself. It\u2019s much better to come with a purpose, putting your name in the Code of Points, or trying a different skill that nobody else did before.\n\n\u201cWhen they get older and when they have achieved as much as she did,\u201d Landi added, \u201cthis is a great way to motivate her to come back in the gym and to train.\u201d\n\nIt is one thing to achieve greatness, but it is quite another to sustain it over a long period of time. And that is what this medals record really means.\n\nMaybe there will be another gymnast who will be able to match Biles\u2019 skills that defy imagination as much as gravity. Maybe there will be another athlete with her athleticism or power. Maybe someone will have her longevity.\n\nBut all of it? Together?\n\n\u201cWe never expected somebody would dominate like this,\u201d national team coordinator Tom Forster said. \u201cCould it happen again? She\u2019s proven it could. Will it? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSimone Biles isn\u2019t just the best gymnast. She\u2019s one of the best athletes, period.", "description": "Simone Biles is so dominant, it's fair to compare her with LeBron James, Serena Williams or Tom Brady.
