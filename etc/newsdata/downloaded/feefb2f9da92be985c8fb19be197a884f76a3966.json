England\u2019s opponent on Saturday, the world champion All Blacks.\n\nThe All Blacks\u2019 mental skills coach will be \u201cthe busiest bloke in Tokyo,\u201d Jones said Tuesday. He described New Zealand\u2019s journalists as \u201cfans with laptops.\u201d He spoke of \u201comens\u201d in the week of Japan\u2019s enthronement of a new emperor.\n\nHe even made accusations of spying.\n\n\u201cThere was definitely someone in the apartment block, filming,\u201d Jones claimed after England\u2019s morning training session.\n\nJones, an Australian, didn\u2019t explicitly accuse the New Zealanders of spying - \u201cit might have been a Japanese fan, I don\u2019t care,\u201d he said - but he added that the viewer wouldn\u2019t have learnt anything new.\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t need to do it anymore,\u201d Jones said. \u201cYou can see everything. You can watch everyone\u2019s training on YouTube. There\u2019s no value in doing that sort of thing, absolutely zero.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows what everyone does - there are no surprises in world rugby anymore. That\u2019s the great thing about the game, you just have to be good enough on the day.\u201d\n\nOne of the most experienced coaches in world rugby, the 59-year-old Jones is widely known for employing mind games ahead of big test matches. The spy claim is likely an attempt to divert the pressure off his England players and onto the All Blacks, who are aiming to win a third straight World Cup title and become world champions for a record-extending fourth time.\n\n\u201cPut up your hand if you think we can win,\u201d Jones said to reporters in a Tokyo hotel, before adding: \u201cThere you go, so no one. No one thinks we can win. There are 120 million Japanese people out there whose second team are the All Blacks. So there\u2019s no pressure on us.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to have a great week, enjoy it, relax. Train hard and enjoy this great opportunity we\u2019ve got. Whereas (the All Blacks) have got to be thinking about how they\u2019re looking for their third (consecutive) World Cup and so that brings some pressure.\u201d\n\nJones said Gilbert Enoke, New Zealand\u2019s mental skills coach, was in for a busy few days.\n\n\u201cThey have to deal with all this pressure of winning the World Cup three times (in a row) and it is potentially the last game for their greatest coach (Steve Hansen) and their greatest captain (Kieran Read), and they will be thinking about those things,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThose thoughts go through your head. It is always harder to defend a World Cup and they will be thinking about that and therefore there is pressure.\u201d\n\nJones was in his element by now, using every trick in his book.\n\nAsked about the Emperor Naruhito\u2019s ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne in a ceremony in Tokyo on Tuesday, thereby becoming Japan\u2019s 126th emperor, Jones even found a way to link that to rugby.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a change in history, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a change in the history of Japan, now we are going to have a change in the history of the World Cup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice symmetry, and I do believe in omens.\u201d\n\nHansen, speaking before Jones in another area of Tokyo, said he could play his part in the expected psychological battle.\n\nJust not yet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real thing - sometimes you\u2019re better not to bother going there and sometimes you are,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cEddie will decide whether he wants to go there and I\u2019ve already decided what I want to do. You\u2019ll have to wait and see, I guess.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a couple more days to go. There\u2019s no point is there? He\u2019s a smart man. He knows me and I know him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It's Rugby World Cup semifinals week and Eddie Jones, one of the sport's sharpest talkers, is in full wind-up mode.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Douglas"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/18/kiwi_coaches_rugby_wcup_78711_c0-195-3500-2236_s1200x700.jpg?264c7fbef378cacdde13c86f54de0b0e08fb3183", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
