Earlier, roads were blocked and demonstrators surrounded the headquarters of the country's electoral board, guarded by rows of police in anti-riot gear.\n\n\"Evo Morales had an acceptable administration,\" said protester Jose Callisaya, 38. But \"it's healthy in a democracy to change leaders.\"\n\nMesa, a former president who leads the Citizen Community party, has called for indefinite protests until a second-round vote is convened, which Morales has ruled out as unconstitutional.\n\n\"The government is despising the popular vote,\" Mesa told local television channel Unitel on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEADY GROWTH\n\nA former union leader for coca farmers, Morales has overseen steady growth and relative stability in one of South America's poorest countries and is now the region's longest-serving president. He has accused the opposition of trying to stir up unrest and denied charges of vote-rigging.\n\nOfficials and diplomats raised concerns the conflict could hit Bolivia's ties with global trade partners and hurt an economy already straining under declining gas exports.\n\nThe country's electoral board denied any political interference in its count and invited anyone to examine voting sheets posted on its website.\n\nMesa's campaign has said it had found irregularities on the website that swung some 100,000 votes in favor of Morales.\n\nBolivia's electoral system was \"absolutely transparent,\" said Idelfonso Mamani, one of the five remaining members of the board following the resignation of its vice president in protest this week. \"We have the means to prove the results,\" he said.\n\nThe office of the country's ombudsman, which monitors conflicts, said 57 people have been arrested and 29 people wounded in this week's protests. Prosecutor Juan Lanchipa said 40 people have been investigated for vandalism.\n\nInterior Minister Carlos Romero called for calm. \"There are people out for blood...to say there's a dictatorship here.\"\n\nThe OAS, a regional group that sent an observer mission to Bolivia, has said it had \"serious doubts\" about the election and earlier this week accepted an invitation by Morales' government to audit it to clear them up. It was unclear when the audit would begin. (Reporting by Vivian Sequera and Daniel Ramos. Writing By Mitra Taj.
