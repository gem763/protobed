The council worker had been so busy that her diet simply wasn\u2019t a priority, resulting in her living off Chinese takeaways, chocolate bars, fish and chips for lunch and crisps for breakfast.\n\nAt her heaviest, Gemma weighed 17 stone and struggled to find clothes to fit her size 22 frame.\n\nShe decided to make a change after she discovered her weight was worsening her asthma, and was motivated to drop dress sizes when she looked at photos from her little boy\u2019s birthday party and didn\u2019t recognise herself.\n\nHaving planned her wedding for September 2019, Gemma officially had a deadline to lose the weight.\n\nAt her heaviest, Gemma weighed 17 stone (Picture: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nWithin the space of a year, she had dropped eight stone and looked completely different, receiving audible gasps from relatives as she walked down the aisle in her dream wedding dress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGemma, from Newcastle, Tyne and Wear, said: \u2018It\u2019s a massive achievement. I was so happy.\n\n\u2018When I bought my dream dress, it didn\u2019t even fit. It didn\u2019t close fully.\n\n\u2018I was a size 22 and it was size 14 \u2013 but it was the dress of my dreams.\n\n\u2018My mum said \u201cyou really shouldn\u2019t do this\u201d as I signed a waiver, confirming I was aware it didn\u2019t fit when I bought it.\n\nBecoming a mum meant Gemma didn\u2019t prioritise her health and lived off takeaways and chocolate (Picture: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\u2018We\u2019d been storing the dress at my mother-in-law\u2019s house for the last year, but eight weeks ago it went to the dressmaker for alterations.\n\n\u2018I was convinced it wasn\u2019t going to fit. I panicked.\n\n\u2018When I put it the dress on it still didn\u2019t fit \u2013 but this time it was too big!\n\n\u2018We had to take four and a half inches off the waist.\n\n\u2018I hit my target three days before the wedding on September 19. I was a size eight and weighed just 9st 3lbs. I\u2019d finally done it.\u2019\n\nGemma bought her size 14 wedding dress a year before the big day and used it as motivation for her weight loss (Picture: Kennedy News/Victoria Sponge Photography)\n\nGemma\u2019s partner Alan had never commented on her weight, but when she announced her plans he told her to do whatever she needed to feel good.\n\nBut as she walked down the aisle, Alan had a tear in his eye.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor family members who\u2019d travelled for the wedding, the big day was the first time they had seen Gemma since her weight loss journey began \u2013 and they barely recognised her after her transformation.\n\nGemma lost the weight by joining Slimming World. She knows she\u2019ll never be cured of her asthma, but she does feel she can breathe more easily now.\n\nHer diet went from chips and takeaways to overnight oats with berries and healthy wraps with chicken and rice.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy journey, but Gemma stuck to it. After just a month of following the plan she had lost half a stone.\n\nGemma said: \u2018I went to the first meeting and was like \u2018oh my god, how do I walk through that door myself?\u2019 But everyone was so supportive.\n\nShe ended up losing eight stone in total (Picture: Kennedy News/Victoria Sponge Photography)\n\n\u2018By September 19, I\u2019d lost half a stone and the following month we booked our wedding.\n\n\u2018The next month I went to the bridal shop and bought a wedding dress for the following September.\n\n\u2018It made me determined to stay on plan. I knew I wanted to fit into that dress.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s tough to keep going. I got bored of the same meals because I wasn\u2019t mixing up the recipes and by December, I almost quit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018My friend Bex joined too to give me motivation and I learnt to cook from fresh.\n\n\u2018There were points where my weight plateaued. I was trying so hard but for a few weeks I wouldn\u2019t lose anything.\n\n\u2018Now I plan each meal. I\u2019ll sit down on Thursday and plan Friday, Saturday and Sunday, then on Monday I\u2019ll plan the next three days.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s amazing to be able to run around with Charlie now and keep up.\u2019\n\nHow Gemma's diet has changed: A typical day in Gemma\u2019s diet before: Breakfast \u2013 chocolate bars and crisps\n\nLunch \u2013 fish and chips with bread and butter at chippy\n\nDinner \u2013 takeaway Chinese or pizza with kebab\n\nSnacks \u2013 sausage rolls or crisps with sandwiches A typical day in Gemma\u2019s diet now: Breakfast \u2013 overnight oats and natural yoghurt and fruit\n\nLunch \u2013 Weight Watchers wrap and pizza topping with measured cheese\n\nDinner \u2013 Diet Coke chicken rice\n\nSnacks \u2013 HiFi bars, fruit\n\nDo you have an amazing wedding or weight loss story to share?
