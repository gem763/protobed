Numerous state constitutions, like that of North Carolina, contain language that goes further than the U.S. Constitution in governing the way elections are held.\n\n\"With judges deciding behind closed doors how many members of Congress from each party is acceptable, judicial elections have become the most consequential in America,\" Phil Berger, the Republican leader of the state Senate, said in a statement.\n\nLast year, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court threw out the state's U.S. congressional lines. The new map was credited with helping Democrats split the state's 18 congressional seats in 2018 after years of Republican dominance.\n\nBoth North Carolina gerrymandering challenges were backed by the National Redistricting Foundation, the litigation arm of a Democratic group founded by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to help break Republican control of the redistricting process in states across the country.\n\n\"For nearly a decade, Republicans have forced the people of North Carolina to vote in districts that were manipulated for their own partisan advantage,\" Holder said in a statement. \"Now \u2014 finally \u2014 the era of Republican gerrymandering in the state is coming to an end.\" (Reporting by Joseph Ax in New York; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "description": "A North Carolina court on Monday temporarily blocked the state from using its congressional map in next year's elections and strongly suggested it would eventually rule the districts were illegally gerrymandered to favor Republicans.
