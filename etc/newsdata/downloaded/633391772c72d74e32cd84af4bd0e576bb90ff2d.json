And if Donald Trump\u2019s the scissors, I\u2019m the f\u2013ing rock,\u201d Mr. Yang said during the crowded event at L.A.\u2019s MacArthur Park.\n\nMr. Yang used similar language a total of nine times during his 32-minute address to supporters, or an average of about once every 3\u00bd minutes.\n\n\u201cYou have to be pretty f\u2013ing stupid to let a trillion-dollar tech company pay nothing in taxes,\u201d Mr. Yang said about retailer Amazon.\n\n\u201cWhat does this look like to you? It looks like a f\u2013ing revolution to me,\u201d Mr. Yang said about his White House campaign.\n\nMr. Yang, who described himself during the rally as both \u201cbarely a f\u2013ing politician\u201d and \u201ca non-politician who is not full of s\u2013,\u201d currently ranks among the top 10 candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, according to several recent nationwide polls.\n\nA 44-year-old tech entrepreneur and former lawyer, Mr. Yang is the only Democratic contender in his tier to not previously hold an elected position. He is hardly alone with respect to using off-color language, however.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke, a former congressman for Texas, pledged in March to curb his use of profanities after a voter asked him during a campaign event to \u201cclean up\u201d his language. He has since changed course, repeatedly describing a rash of recent mass shootings as \u201cf\u2013ed up\u201d and subsequently selling campaign T-shirts with that slogan.\n\nMore recently, the Democratic Party forwarded a memo to candidates from ABC reminding them not to swear during the most recent primary debate.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to take this opportunity to remind you that, as the debate will air on the ABC broadcast network, we are governed by Federal Communications Commission indecency rules,\u201d Rick Klein, the network\u2019s political director, wrote in the memo last month. \u201cCandidates should therefore avoid cursing or expletives in accordance with federal law.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
