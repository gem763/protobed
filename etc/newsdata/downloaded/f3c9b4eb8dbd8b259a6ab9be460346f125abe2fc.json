This simple risotto, easily doubled, is a good way to make the most of even the most modest of harvests.\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nCook 30 min\n\nServes 2\n\n20g dried porcini\n\n\u00bd onion or 2 shallots\n\n30g parmesan\n\n100g fresh chanterelles (or other mushrooms)\n\n1.1 litres good chicken or vegetable stock\n\n25g butter, plus 2 tbsp extra to finish\n\n200g risotto rice \u2013 I like carnaroli, but the more widely available arborio or more niche vialone nano will also do\n\n120ml white wine\n\n1 garlic clove\n\nA couple of parsley sprigs, to finish\n\n1 Chop and change\n\nThis dish is very versatile. I used chanterelles, but almost any fresh mushrooms will do (in fact, it will be lovely made with just dried porcini alone). If you don\u2019t have stock, soak the porcini in the same amount of hot water instead. You can use dry sherry or vermouth rather than wine. And for a vegan version, replace the butter with olive oil and the cheese with a sprinkle of nutritional yeast.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Get everything ready and good to go before you start cooking: chop the onion and clean the fresh mushrooms.\n\n2 Prepare the base\n\nBoil 150ml water and use this to soak the dried mushrooms for at least five minutes. Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the onion or shallots, grate the parmesan and trim and gently brush any dirt off the fresh mushrooms with a damp cloth. If you have large mushrooms, cut them into bite-sized pieces.\n\n3 Get the stock ready\n\nBring the stock to a simmer, strain in the mushroom soaking water, and set aside the soaked mushrooms. Taste the stock: you\u2019ll be reducing it further, so it shouldn\u2019t be too salty to begin with \u2013 dilute with a little more water, if necessary, then leave on a low heat while you get on with the risotto.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sweat the onion in melted butter until soft and translucent...\n\n4 Start the risotto\n\nMelt the butter in a wide saucepan over a medium-low heat, and gently fry the chopped onion until soft \u2013 don\u2019t let it colour. Tip in the rice and cook, stirring, until most of the grains are coated and translucent \u2013 this will take a few minutes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ... add the rice, stir to coat in the fat, then add the wine.\n\n5 Add stock and start stirring\u2026\n\nTurn up the heat under the pan slightly and, once it\u2019s warmed back up, pour in the wine; it should sizzle as it hits the pan. Cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated, then start adding the stock one ladleful at a time, continuing to stir as you do so, and not adding the next ladle of stock until the pan is almost dry.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Add the hot stock a ladleful at a time, stirring until it\u2019s absorbed by the rice before adding the next ladle.\n\n6 Repeat and stir some more\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, stir in the soaked dried mushrooms. Keep adding stock and stirring until the rice is done to your liking \u2013 this should take another eight to 12 minutes, though exactly how long will depend on your tastes. In theory, the rice should still be firm, but not chalky in the middle; if you prefer it softer, however, that\u2019s your prerogative.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Add the dried porcini and, once the rice is cooked, stir in the remaining butter and most of the grated cheese.\n\n7 Adjust the consistency\n\nOnce you\u2019re happy with the texture of the rice, correct the consistency of the mixture; risotto shouldn\u2019t sit on the plate like a solid lump, but flow across it like a wave, so add a little more stock, if need be, stirring until the rice is loose and creamy. Stir in most of the grated parmesan and a tablespoon of the extra butter, then cover the pan and leave to sit off the heat for five minutes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fry the fresh mushrooms, then plate up the risotto and top with the mushrooms, parsley and more cheese.\n\n8 Fry the fresh mushrooms\n\nWhile the risotto is resting, finely chop or crush the garlic and melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the garlic for 30 seconds or so, before turning up the heat and adding the fresh mushrooms. Saute for a few minutes until they\u2019re just starting to brown around the edges, then take off the heat.\n\n9 A final flourish\n\nGive the risotto a good stir and season to taste (it probably won\u2019t need any more salt, because the parmesan has a fair bit already). Divide between plates or shallow bowls and top with the fried mushroom mixture. Roughly chop the parsley and sprinkle over the top, then finish with the remaining cheese and eat immediately.", "description": "Autumn brings with it earthier flavours, celebrated in this step-by-step wild mushroom risotto", "authors": ["Felicity Cloake"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e1bad29b41e7562d4b85832a8ede1fbaefdc830/1160_1583_5467_3281/master/5467.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8eaa7a6f8cd62c69633a489e8b94bdb2", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
