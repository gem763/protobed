Like the horror films that inspired it, \"Nothing Is Safe masterfully builds tension and an imposing sense of dread. This is the soundtrack to our reality: unsettling, dark, sinister. \u2014Kevin Cole, KEXP, Seattle, Washington\n\nYouTube\n\nEsther Rose, \"Sex & Magic\"\n\nWYEP\n\nCountry music that's as raw as it gets, with squeaking lo-fi violin, plaintive vocals and sexual humor. \u2014Rosemary Welsch, WYEP, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nYouTube\n\nFlora & Fawna, \"Slow Burn\"\n\nFolk- and soul-inspired harmonies meet electronic production.

Sounding as if Imagine Dragons and AWOLNATION had a baby, this Nevada transplant found a way to placate the Renner fans who are mourning the loss of his app. We recommend listening to this electro-rock anthem as you sip the Jeremy Renner cocktail. (It's whiskey-based!) \u2014Malayna Joy, Gia DeSantis, David Hadel, Jake Wagner, NV89, Reno/Las Vegas, Nevada\n\nYouTube\n\nJuiceboxxx, \"Coinstar Song\"\n\nMilwaukee's Juiceboxxx may be broke, but he's not broken. \"Coinstar Song\" is an anthem for anyone scratching and surviving in a cash-strapped world. \u2014Gini Mascorro, KXT, Dallas, Fort Worth, Texas\n\nYouTube\n\nJulie Dexter, \"It Ain't Easy\"\n\nJulie Dexter creates music that moves your mind, body and soul. Her fitting reminder that \"It Ain't Easy\" inspires when life provides enormous challenges. \u2014J. Michael Harrison, WRTI, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nLady Wray, \"Come On In\"\n\nWUNC\n\nA simple drum, bass and piano riff drives \"Come On In,\" giving Nicole Wray a whole lot of room to let her vocals shine in an upbeat, hopeful jam. \u2014Brian Burns, WUNC, Chapel Hill, North Carolina\n\nYouTube\n\nParticle Kid, \"Radio Flyer\"\n\n\"Radio Flyer\" uses a mix of idealism and psychedelic rock to find a connection in a spiritually and morally disconnected world. \u2014Stacy Buchanan, WGBH, Boston, Massachusetts\n\nYouTube\n\nPony Bradshaw, \"Charlatan\"\n\nYou know the feeling of driving a high-performance car when you're forced to go 20 mph? That's the restraint you hear in \"Charlatan\" from Pony Bradshaw's new album Sudden Opera. It's powerful stuff. \u2014Jessie Scott, WMOT, Nashville, Tennessee\n\nYouTube\n\nThe Regrettes, \"I Dare You\"\n\nHouston Public Media\n\nOn the sugary lead single from The Regrettes' new album, frontwoman Lydia Night sings about mustering the courage to let yourself fall in love, in spite of the red flags. \u2014Troy Schulze, Houston Public Media, Houston, Texas\n\nYouTube\n\nThe Shivas, \"Gloria\"\n\nIn the first single from the Portland band's forthcoming Dark Thoughts, walls of choppy, psychedelic guitars give way to surf-rock solos and remarkable group vocals that move the hazy \"Gloria\" forward with surprising force. \u2014 Jerad Walker, OPB, Portland, Oregon\n\nVelvet Negroni, \"KURT KOBAIN\"\n\nAs his name implies, Velvet Negroni is smooth with a late-night vibe, stitching together healthy servings of soul, synths and lots of thick beats. \"KURT KOBAIN\" is not what you're expecting. \u2014Alisa Ali, WFUV, New York, New York\n\nYouTube\n\nStream this month's Station Breaks picks on NPR Slingshot's Spotify.", "description": "Discover an experimental hip-hop trio and an infectious combination of new wave, disco and indie rock.
