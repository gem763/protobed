Is that even a question? I spent the first 23 years of my life playing a straight man.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery gay man has the experience at some point in his life of pretending to be someone he\u2019s not,\u201d he continued. \u201cI knew as a teenager that I was gay, yet I was still sleeping with girls, pretending to be straight, playing this persona I thought I needed to be for my sport. The stakes were so high. I remember going to crazy lengths to make people believe I was someone I was not. That\u2019s acting.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, audiences have begun pushing back against actors who are not part of the LGBTQ community playing queer characters on screen. Last year, Scarlett Johansson dropped out of the upcoming film \u201cRub and Tug,\u201d about a transgender massage parlor owner, after her casting was widely criticized.\n\nAfter winning an Emmy for playing gay serial killer Andrew Cunanan in \u201cThe Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story,\u201d Darren Criss vowed to no longer play queer characters in an effort to make space for LGBTQ actors in the industry.\n\nOn the flip side, Kenworthy said he believes \u201cit\u2019s much more OK for a gay man to play a straight role than vice versa.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost shows are about straight people and straight lives and straight dynamics, and if there is a gay character on the show, it\u2019s usually a sidekick,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAllowing a gay person to play that character does a lot in terms of visibility and breaking down perceptions and stereotypes. ... There aren\u2019t many openly gay actors getting cast in straight parts. But that is changing, and I am lucky to have the opportunity to be part of that change.\u201d\n\nLike many Murphy-produced shows, \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d has boasted a queer-inclusive cast across all nine of its seasons. In addition to Kenworthy, \u201c1984\u201d stars Angelica Ross, who is transgender.\n\nActors Chaz Bono, Billy Eichner and Cheyenne Jackson have starred in other installments of the horror anthology series, the ninth season of which premiered Wednesday on FX.", "description": "\"I spent the first 23 years of my life playing a straight man,\u201d the Olympian, who is gay, wrote in an ESPN essay.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d83e03a3b0000039fd7e80c.jpeg?cache=kerfkpqiif&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
