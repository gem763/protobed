Trump\u2019s appeal, much of them involving discontent with the alternatives in both parties offered to voters in 2016. But now, 32 months into his presidency, the more pressing question is how Trump maintains such steady support despite his erratic behavior, his incessant lying, his outbursts of racist malevolence, and his many broken promises.\n\nIs it simply a matter of a booming economy anesthetizing people who really only care about their own pocketbooks, and if so, could the steadily increasing economic jitters \u2014 many of them directly attributable to Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 finally send his approval ratings into a downward spiral? Is the whole MAGA movement purely and simply an effort by demographic \u201closers\u201d \u2014 particularly white men on the margins of the economy and society \u2014 to turn back the clock? Or is Trump just an especially lurid product of extreme ideological and partisan polarization \u2014 proof that literally anyone can command one of the two major political parties with no serious erosion of support?\n\nTo these much-discussed possibilities \u2014 each with its own implications for 2020 and American political life generally \u2014 you can add an especially alarming alternative explanation highlighted in a column by the New York Times\u2019 Thomas Edsall: Trump is tapping into a hunger for chaos that he is uniquely qualified to feed. According to an award-winning paper by three political scientists (two from Denmark and one from Temple University), there is a sort of toxic synergy at work between this \u201cpopulist\u201d pol, chaos-seeking voters, and social media that has placed Trumpism in the mainstream of American politics:\n\nIt argues that a segment of the American electorate that was once peripheral is drawn to \u201cchaos incitement\u201d and that this segment has gained decisive influence through the rise of social media.\n\nHow do Petersen, Osmundsen and Arceneaux measure this \u201cneed for chaos\u201d? They conducted six surveys, four in the United States, in which they interviewed 5157 participants, and two in Denmark, with 1336. They identified those who are \u201cdrawn to chaos\u201d through their affirmative responses to the following statements:\n\nI fantasize about a natural disaster wiping out most of humanity such that a small group of people can start all over.\n\nI think society should be burned to the ground.\n\nWhen I think about our political and social institutions, I cannot help thinking \u201cjust let them all burn.\u201d\n\nWe cannot fix the problems in our social institutions, we need to tear them down and start over.\n\nSometimes I just feel like destroying beautiful things.\n\nIn an email, Petersen wrote that preliminary examination of the data shows \u201cthat the \u2018need for chaos\u2019 correlates positively with sympathy for Trump but also \u2014 although less strongly \u2014 with sympathy for Sanders. It correlates negatively with sympathy for Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nMore terrifyingly, they found sizable numbers of people agreeing with three of the five \u201cchaos\u201d statements:\n\nThe responses to three of the statements in particular were \u201cstaggering,\u201d the paper says: 24 percent agreed that society should be burned to the ground; 40 percent concurred with the thought that \u201cWhen it comes to our political and social institutions, I cannot help thinking \u2018just let them all burn\u2019 \u201d; and 40 percent also agreed that \u201cwe cannot fix the problems in our social institutions, we need to tear them down and start over.\u201d\n\nIf you ever wondered to whom Trump was addressing his dark vision of \u201cthis American carnage\u201d in his inaugural address, this could be your answer. More importantly, perhaps, these chaos-seekers don\u2019t seem to care about empirical data or even truthfulness:\n\nPetersen, Osmundsen and Arceneaux find that those who meet their definition of having a \u201cneed for chaos\u201d express that need by willingly spreading disinformation. Their goal is not to advance their own ideology but to undermine political elites, left and right, and to \u201cmobilize others against politicians in general.\u201d These disrupters do not \u201cshare rumors because they believe them to be true. For the core group, hostile political rumors are simply a tool to create havoc.\u201d\n\nTo put it another way, when Trump says and does outrageous things, he\u2019s just \u201cowning the libs,\u201d or defying \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d which is a more important goal than truth-telling to people driven by fury. This could well be the reality underlying Salena Zito\u2019s famous maxim that MAGA folk \u201ctake Trump seriously, but not literally.\u201d What are a few thousand lies among comrades-in-arms?\n\nEdsall ends his column with some unhappy thoughts about how these chaos-seekers, who are almost by definition hostile to democratic norms, might react to a Trump defeat in 2020:\n\nIf voters deny Trump a second term, how many of his most ardent supporters, especially those with a \u201cneed for chaos,\u201d will find defeat unbearable?\n\nIt\u2019s certainly a fear I\u2019ve expressed, based in part on the regular efforts of Trump and the GOP to promote voter-fraud and election-theft myths in the last few years. But beyond that lurid scenario, evidence that a significant share of Trump supporters are as nihilistic and destructive as Donald Trump himself supplies a sort of Occam\u2019s-razor answer to all the questions about why they put up with him: His worst traits are a feature, not a bug, for those who take pleasure in chaos. Yes, maybe there is a progressive cure for this malady that you can prescribe via the right mix of economic policies and demonstrations that cultural and demographic change is good for us all. But it would appear that appeals to sweet reason, or even to self-interest, will produce limited results. Maybe it\u2019s enough to drive Trump and his enablers from office, but the longer he\u2019s there, Americans addicted to the chaos he embodies will want more.", "description": "A new political-science study suggests that a significant number of Trump supporters seek and crave the kind of chaos he embodies, and don\u2019t care if he lies and says and does outrageous things, which is one key to the durability of his support.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/04/04-trump-supporters.w1200.h630.jpg"}
