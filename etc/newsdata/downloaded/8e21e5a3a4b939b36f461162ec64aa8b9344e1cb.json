The ideas on how to accomplish that are endless: a bath; a glass of wine; five minutes locked in the bathroom with a book.\n\nBut when I went looking for self care, what I found restorative wasn\u2019t restful at all. It was active, and had me hanging from the ceiling. I decided to take an aerialist silks class.\n\nRead more from Christa Couture: I Couldn't Find Disability Maternity Photos, So I Made My Own\n\nYou know, like in Cirque du Soleil, where the two long pieces of fabric hang from the ceiling and a person climbs up high, swings, dives and seemingly flies through the air.\n\nParenting is full of rewards, but at times, I have felt inept and disheartened by the challenges. I needed to find something where I could feel a little bit of mastery, feel wholly present in my body and feel like I was getting a genuine break from my home life in a short amount of time.\n\nI imagined I would have to be cut down.\n\nWhen you watch the pros do silks, it seems unfathomable, magical. It\u2019s not something I would have ever thought of trying, not in small part because it looks like you need killer core strength and I\u2019ve had two c-sections. But I was watching an episode of Queer Eye where someone tries silks for the first time, and I bolted upright. \"That looks like something I could do,\" I thought.\n\nOnce I started looking for a class, I found there\u2019s an entire circus arts community, including a number of options for teachers and spaces. I chose a private class because I\u2019m not exactly a sporty person. I don\u2019t run. I don\u2019t go to the gym. I have never taken dance classes. I\u2019ve done a little bit of yoga, but wouldn\u2019t be able to name half the poses I pull off in my living room sporadically. Taking any kind of fitness or movement class is daunting to me, and I didn\u2019t want to try something new in front of a load of strangers \u2014 strangers who might be immediate naturals, while I got stuck in a knot halfway to the ceiling.\n\nI imagined I would have to be cut down.\n\n...the arms that carry my toddler all the time, the back that\u2019s bending constantly to pick up toys, relaxed.\n\nI arrived at my scheduled time as a group class was ending. I took my shoes off and walked along the sidelines while a few women were suspended in moves high above the ground and a few others sat on the floor watching, commenting and encouraging their peers. I looked away, worried if I saw what others were capable of I\u2019d feel more insecure about my starting point.\n\nAfter the others filed out, the instructor instantly put me at ease. We stretched, chatted and then began. She showed me a \u201cleg lock\u201d used to climb up the silks, and with just one step, I was off the floor. I felt accomplished already! She tied a knot in the silks and showed me how to hang upside down. My body sighed into being inverted; the arms that carry my toddler all the time, the back that\u2019s bending constantly to pick up toys, relaxed.\n\nRead more from Christa Couture: I Went on Tinder When I Was Five Months Pregnant\n\nIt didn\u2019t take much to break a sweat \u2014 even small silks moves are a big workout \u2014 and I left my first class hooked. I returned the next week, and the week after that, slowly but surely building my confidence, my physical strength and my repertoire. Each week, my teacher gave me just enough instruction to both push my limits and accomplish something. That balance was critical, and it lifted my spirits and refreshed my body.\n\nPicking yourself up off the floor is an easy metaphor \u2014 in silks, you are literally using your own strength to lift yourself up. In the daily chaos and frustration of being a mom, it can often feel like you never get the hang of things, like you never do it right, or that you never do enough.\n\nAt silks, I get to try something that\u2019s also enormously challenging, to push past my boundaries and try, try again until I do get it right \u2014 for one hour a week. It\u2019s one of the few hours I get to myself, but it\u2019s enough to come home aglow, empowered and ready for the next toddler tantrum.", "description": "Everyone could use a break from parenting every once in a while \u2014 even for a short while.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/parents/content/imgs/_8col/christa-couture-aerial.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
