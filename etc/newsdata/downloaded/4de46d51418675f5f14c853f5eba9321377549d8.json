Not only does the singer\u2019s skimpy look reek of cultural appropriation, they say, but it also sexualizes an outfit that\u2019s meant to be serious and dignified.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\ni love u @kaceymusgraves, really, like i just bought tickets to your radio city music hall show in nyc. and u lookin' slim thicc and all that. but girl u can notttt wear a vietnamese ao dai without the pants. it's just wrong. pls respond bc this hurt my feelings :( pic.twitter.com/wJBHwybvyt \u2014 dan q. dao (@danqdao) October 12, 2019\n\nOn today\u2019s episode of Caucasian celebrity appropriating and oversexualizing an ethnic traditional costume #cultureappropriation https://t.co/KjHqp3YJ2C \u2014 Emmy Tran (@EmmyTranPR) October 13, 2019\n\n\u201cWhen people do things like this, all it does is contribute to the dangerous notion of Southeast Asian femininity as inherently sexual,\u201d Mai Nguyen Do, a poet and PhD student, wrote on Twitter, adding, \u201cPlease don\u2019t further degrade this key part of Vietnamese culture and put on some pants like everyone else that wears \u00e1o d\u00e0i.\u201d\n\nMusgraves\u2019s publicist did not respond to a request for comment late Tuesday.\n\nA two-panel tunic that drapes down to the knees or lower, the ao dai traditionally includes i underneath. As with other aspects of Vietnamese culture, the outfit represents a fusion of French, American and Chinese influences, according to Kieu-Linh Caroline Valverde, a professor of Asian American studies at the University of California at Davis.\n\nAD\n\nWhere the garment was traditionally worn as a school uniform, people in Vietnam now wear it on holidays, at pageants or on their wedding days.\n\nAD\n\n\u00c1o D\u00e0i is the representation of the idea \u201cwomen do not need to show skin to look pretty\u201d. You\u2019re doing the OPPOSITE of what this outfit was made for. Here\u2019s how we wear it throughout the years (notice how it\u2019s been decades and changes, we still have the pants on) : pic.twitter.com/781yl72cgi \u2014 \u201cFINALLY, LEO\u201d (@LeoTs13) October 12, 2019\n\nBut other social media users pointed out that Musgraves was also wearing a headpiece that looked a lot like a maang tikka, a form of Indian bridal jewelry. This mixing of cultures, they said, only made her clothing choice more tone-deaf and propelled her deeper into the discussion on cultural appropriation.\n\nIndeed, Musgraves\u2019s ao dai, first shown off on her Instagram, seems to be the latest episode in an ongoing controversy over how \u2014 or whether \u2014 someone can wear clothing from another culture. It\u2019s a question that has carried through to prom dresses, frat party themes, Halloween costumes and music festival garb, with some examples more widely condemned than others.\n\nAD\n\nThe music world in particular has been no stranger to this story, especially when white artists have worn clothing, jewelry or makeup from nonwhite cultures. Pop singer Katy Perry was slammed in 2013 for performing at an awards show dressed as a geisha. Selena Gomez and Iggy Azalea have drawn heat for wearing bindis. Miley Cyrus has apologized for being \u201cinsensitive\u201d in the past, probably referring to when she twerked and wore grills, though the same could not be said of Justin Bieber getting cornrows.\n\nAD\n\nBut perhaps the most egregious example came from Lady Gaga, whose since-altered lyrics in the leaked 2013 demo \u201cBurqa\u201d asked: \u201cDo you wanna see me naked, lover? Do you wanna peak underneath the cover?\u201d\n\nAs in that case, critics accused the pop star of imposing an overtly sexual narrative on a fashion that does not \u2014 and should not \u2014 hold such a connotation.\n\nAD\n\nIn the case of the ao dai, it carries \u201ca sense of elegance and modesty\u201d that Musgraves had ignored, one critic said. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t mind you wearing \u00e1o d\u00e0i but please show my culture respect by wearing it correctly,\u201d the man wrote on Twitter.\n\nIt\u2019s disappointing to see the beautiful Vietnamese \u00e1o d\u00e0i worn like this. It\u2019s meant to be worn with the pants. Personally, I don\u2019t mind you wearing \u00e1o d\u00e0i but please show my culture respect by wearing it correctly. @KaceyMusgraves\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s photos of my mom wearing it- pic.twitter.com/doWY12d1id \u2014 Follow: Find Triet (@yeuyourself) October 14, 2019\n\nAnother noted that ao dai shows that beauty doesn\u2019t come from showing skin. Naomi Campbell, Rihanna and Tyra Banks have all worn the garment appropriately, they said.\n\nIt\u2019s for that reason that some, like YouTube personality and beauty blogger Michelle Phan, were upset that Musgraves had snapped backstage photos of herself wearing little else but the garment, noting that Western culture has long fetishized Asian women and seen them as submissive.\n\n\u201cImagine seeing your national traditional dress being disrespected on stage,\u201d Phan wrote on her Instagram account. \u201cSince she\u2019s a public figure, she might influence more people to think it\u2019s trendy.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "At her show in Dallas last week, the country star wore only the tunic portion of the Vietnamese outfit.", "authors": ["Teo Armus", "Reporter On The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/T856fCJ3Ixe96KrQrXi1M66E7B4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y3XDO3HOIAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
