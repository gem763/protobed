He summoned him and said, \u2018What is this I hear about you? Prepare a full account of your stewardship, because you can no longer be my steward.\u2019 The steward said to himself, \u2018What shall I do, now that my master is taking the position of steward away from me? I am not strong enough to dig and I am ashamed to beg. I know what I shall do so that, when I am removed from the stewardship, they may welcome me into their homes.\u2019 He called in his master\u2019s debtors one by one. To the first he said, \u2018How much do you owe my master?\u2019 He replied, \u2018One hundred measures of olive oil.\u2019 He said to him, \u2018Here is your promissory note. Sit down and quickly write one for fifty.\u2019 Then to another the steward said, \u2018And you, how much do you owe?\u2019 He replied, \u2018One hundred kors of wheat.\u2019 The steward said to him, \u2018Here is your promissory note; write one for eighty.\u2019 And the master commended that dishonest steward for acting prudently. \u201cFor the children of this world are more prudent in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light. I tell you, make friends for yourselves with dishonest wealth, so that when it fails, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings. The person who is trustworthy in very small matters is also trustworthy in great ones; and the person who is dishonest in very small matters is also dishonest in great ones. If, therefore, you are not trustworthy with dishonest wealth, who will trust you with true wealth? If you are not trustworthy with what belongs to another, who will give you what is yours? No servant can serve two masters. He will either hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and mammon.\u201d\n\nFor today, I present Confession Time. Forgive me readers, for I have sinned \u2014 I went to Mass last night instead of today and listened to our priest\u2019s homily on this mystifying parable before writing my reflection. In this case, I truly needed all the help I could get.\n\nOn the surface and in its literal presentation, this parable makes little sense. Jesus tells the story of a dishonest servant who has been caught dissipating his master\u2019s property. Rather than repent, the steward decides to dissipate the master\u2019s property even further by ingratiating those who owe the master by cheating him to their benefit. That way, when the master throws him out, he will have earned credit with these other businessmen and might live without doing honest work. The steward falsely draws down their debt and makes the master poorer as a result. And yet, when the master finds out, he commends the steward for his prudence.\n\nNeedless to say, the literal moral of the story \u2014 cheat big \u2014 isn\u2019t exactly what one would expect to hear from Jesus Christ. One might think that the master\u2019s initial beef with the steward was that he wasn\u2019t dishonest enough. If one takes this literally and without the instruction that Jesus provides immediately afterward, it seems completely contradictory to Jesus\u2019 entire mission.\n\nThe key to unlocking this parable isn\u2019t the steward; it\u2019s the master. In Jesus\u2019 parables, the master is used to represent the Lord. We see this most clearly in the parable of the prodigal son from last week\u2019s Mass readings, but also in parables more structurally similar to this one. In Luke 12, for instance, Jesus talks about the necessity to prepare for the master\u2019s return from a wedding banquet at any hour, a clear reference to the Lord. In Luke 17, Jesus taught about the master and his commands to slaves being carried out as not being sufficient to overcome the need for humility, and in both Matthew and Luke we hear the parable of the talents, in which Jesus teaches that the master expects his stewards to use the gifts he has given them to increase his estate. Those who do are commended as \u201cgood and faithful servants,\u201d while those who do not are consigned to the outer darkness.\n\nThe steward in this parable is anything but \u201cgood and faithful.\u201d In fact, he\u2019s rotten and duplicitous, even more so after his master catches him at it. So why does the master praise him? It\u2019s because the steward is serving the wrong master. Unlike in Jesus\u2019 other parables, this master doesn\u2019t represent the Lord \u2014 it represents the material world, the priorities of fallen man, and perhaps even Satan himself. The steward gets rewarded for his fealty to avarice and corruption because that\u2019s precisely what he serves.\n\nOne has to wonder whether Jesus told this parable with a smile on his face, knowing that his disciples already had a sense of the rhythm of His parables. They would have expected that the master represented the Lord at the beginning of this tale, as do we all. The final line in the parable must have been quite a gotcha for them, as it is clearly meant for us.\n\nThis device causes confusion, perhaps even more so in its day, but Jesus makes clear what the parable means immediately afterward. People will adhere to whatever they put in their hearts. If they choose the material world over God, that will come out in ways both great and small over time. If they choose the Lord over the material world and sin, they will prove themselves over time in that as well. The choice to serve mammon becomes increasingly difficult to reverse; the more we follow that idol, the more corrupt we become, and the more we corrupt those around us. After all, we don\u2019t know if the master\u2019s debtors were corrupt before the steward went out to protect himself, but we certainly know that they were corrupt in their dealings with the servant \u2014 willing to cheat this master when it served them.\n\nWe hear the same lesson from Amos in our first reading. Not long before the Northern Kingdom is destroyed, the prophet warns the Israelites that their cheating in small ways is leading them toward destruction. They have taken the Lord\u2019s proscriptions, meant to protect the poor and needy, and have manipulated them for their own financial greed. \u201cNever will I forget a thing they have done!\u201d the Lord tells them through Amos. They have proven themselves unworthy in small things, and that has led them to openly defy the Lord on the larger things.\n\nThis parable reminds us that choosing the right master is the key to salvation. Choosing poorly locks us into a series of escalating corruptions from which we will find it difficult to extricate ourselves. Even in his crisis, the steward had a choice: he could go out and earn an honest living (or rely on the charity of good people), or he could increase his corruption to maintain himself. Jesus offers us forgiveness for our sins if we truly repent at any time, but the more we serve mammon, the less we are capable of hearing and believing that promise.\n\nWe have to choose not just between God and mammon, but between truth and deception. In the end, the latter becomes self-deception, to the point where we convince ourselves that the choice is no longer possible. And that\u2019s the greatest self-deception of all.\n\nThe front-page image is a detail from \u201cJesus Christ and the Rich Young Ruler,\u201d Heinrich Hoffman, 1889.
