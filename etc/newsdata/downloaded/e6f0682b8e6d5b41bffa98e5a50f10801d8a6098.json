I am truly disgusted.\"\n\n(Image: Leon Neal)\n\nMP Margaret Hodge, who has repeatedly clashed with Mr Corbyn over anti-Semitism,said she was \u201cabsolutely devastated that Louise Ellman feels that she no longer has a place in the Labour Party\u201d.\n\nShe tweeted: \u201cLouise has given decades of her life to public service & having known her for nearly forty years I am proud to call her a close friend.\u201d\n\nLabour MP Stella Creasy said she was \"ashamed\" that Dame Louise felt the need to resign.\n\nShe told the BBC: \"I'm gutted. It is heartbreaking for me.\n\n\"To be in a position where yet again another female Jewish MP feels no longer welcome in the Labour Party shames us all.\"\n\nLabour former deputy leader Harriet Harman described the resignation of Dame Louise as \"very sad news\".\n\nShe tweeted: \"Thank you, Louise, for your terrific contribution to Parliament, politics and the Labour Party!\"\n\nShadow Northern Ireland minister Tony Lloyd said Mrs Ellman \"isn't wrong\" to call on Labour \"to deal with anti-Semitism\".\n\nHe told the BBC: \"There are many decent people in the Labour Party and the majority of people hold no truck with anti-Semitism and we've got to drive it out.\n\n\"I don't want to be in the same party as that small minority of people who think that anti-Semitism is acceptable. It's not - it's not acceptable in my party, it's not acceptable in my country.\n\n\"We've got to work together to make it clear we will not tolerate it.\"\n\nLabour has previously said the handling of anti-Semitism cases - which relate to \"about 0.06% of members\" - had been sped up more than four-fold.\n\nA Labour Party spokesman said: \"Jeremy Corbyn thanks Louise Ellman for her service to the Labour Party over many years.\n\n\"Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party are fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and continue to take robust action to root out anti-Semitism in the party and wider society.\n\n\"Jeremy Corbyn has consistently supported struggles for human rights and justice around the world and made the right calls in the interests of security and peace.\"", "description": "MPs rallied round the 73-year-old MP for Liverpool Riverside since 1997 as she said she could return to Labour - but not under Jeremy Corbyn", "authors": ["Ben Glaze", "Dan Bloom", "Image", "Dan Kitwood", "Daily Mirror", "Leon Neal"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13180589.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Delegates-Attend-The-2018-Jewish-Labour-Movement-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
