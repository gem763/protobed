All have now stopped lending and are part of the administration process.\n\nPayday lender, The Money Shop, also closed earlier this year, making the third in just over 12 months.", "description": "Borrowers who believe they were mis-sold a loan by the collapsed payday lender will need to apply for compensation via an online portal", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article1754522.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Payday-loans.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
