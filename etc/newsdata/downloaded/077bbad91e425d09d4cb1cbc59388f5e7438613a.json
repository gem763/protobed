The tourists, monitored by television crews, waited patiently to see if conditions would improve.\n\nAn estimated 37 people have died on Uluru since Western tourists began climbing the site in the middle of last century, via a track so steep in parts that some scared visitors descend backward or on all fours. Some slipped on wet rock and fell to their deaths. Others, often unfit or elderly, suffered heart attacks from the strenuous walk and high temperatures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite the physical dangers \u2014 including the infamous 1980 killing of a baby by a dingo at a local campsite \u2014 Uluru became one of Australia\u2019s most popular and recognized tourist destinations.\n\nTwo years ago, the indigenous custodians of the area said they intended to close Uluru to climbers on Oct. 26, exactly 34 years after the national government transferred the site to its traditional owners. Climbers who violate the ban will face steep fines.\n\nThe decision by the Anangu people, who regard the rock as a sacred site and discourage people from climbing it, triggered an influx this week of visitors from Australia and overseas eager to make the ascent \u2014 and post the achievement on social media \u2014 while they could still do so legally.\n\nAlthough Uluru appears to be shades of earthy red, depending on the time of day, it is a gray sedimentary rock called arkose. Iron ore in the rock that has rusted from contact with water creates red flakes that have turned Uluru into a geological Instagram star.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo reduce the dangers of climbing it, Uluru is closed whenever winds pick up, the temperature rises above 97 degrees, or there is rain.\n\nOn Thursday, when it quickly hit 104 degrees, no one was allowed to climb after 8 a.m., an hour after opening.\n\nA 32-year-old Japanese tourist, Tomoyasu Kato, was among those who reached the top. \u201cIt was scarier than fun,\u201d he told an Australian newspaper, the Age. \u201cI enjoyed being at the top but my heart was beating hard when I was coming down. My heart was saying, \u2018danger, danger.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAs dawn broke Friday, a line of would-be climbers snaked 600 yards from the entrance gate. The sky was clear and the forecast was 91 degrees, but a strong easterly wind whipped through the starkly beautiful landscape.\n\nIt looked like those who had held out until the last day, or were too late on Thursday, might miss out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe spirits have a sense of humour,\u201d tweeted freelance writer Shaney Hudson.\n\nThen, around 10 a.m., several rangers gathered at the locked gate, surrounded by television crews and tourists.\n\nUluru had been one of the most popular topics on Twitter all morning in Australia, and many of the posts were critical of people willing to defy Aboriginal requests to observe the rock only from the ground.\n\n\u201cI need you to clear away from the gate,\u201d one ranger told a cameraman. \u201cThe climb will now be open.\u201d\n\nAfter brief, spontaneous applause, the crowd surged forward, led by a young man with a backpack who sprinted up the base.\n\nWithin half an hour, an antlike line of figures stretched from the ground to the summit, moving methodically up the red rock for the last time.", "description": "The Outback monolith is sacred to indigenous people, who have long implored visitors not to ascend the rock and have now imposed a ban on climbing it.", "authors": ["A.
