With products from mattresses to beauty to food being delivered straight to the consumer\u2019s doorstep, how are brands able to differentiate themselves from the competition? And with brands being laser focused on the shopper, are brands giving consumers too much control over how brand relationships are built and the content that brands put forth? Whatever the answers are, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re reaching a pivotal point in the DTC evolution.\n\nOn the one hand, VCs continue to invest billions of dollars each year to help consumer brands grow, with the hopes that they will go public or even reach unicorn status. On the other hand, we have started to see cracks in these strategies, with many brands not focusing enough on early profitability and caving to pressure from VCs to meet the valuation expectations of the market at all costs.\n\nThe good news is that there\u2019s a viable structure that isn\u2019t actually all that new \u2013 one that today\u2019s DTC brands are beginning to implement. More and more companies are finding success by returning to a traditional holding company approach, but one that has been re-engineered to fit today\u2019s market. Will this approach be the savior of DTC brands?\n\nThe original holding company model\n\nIn the 1950s, consumer holding companies like Procter and Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, and Unilever emerged as a way for each large parent company to essentially protect all of its assets by way of diversification.\n\nInstead of siloing individual brands, the holding company model allowed these companies to build best-in-class expertise in core functions and shared resources like distribution, marketing, and supply chain management that could be leveraged across their portfolio of products.\n\nAs a result, brands benefit from collaborative institutional knowledge, capital efficiencies, stronger IP, as well as bigger R&D and marketing budgets. For years, these companies operated primarily through traditional distribution channels (e.g. retail) and with limited technological support.\n\nThe evolution of DTC brands\n\nMore recently, there has been a seismic shift as DTC brands make technology a centerpiece of their marketing efforts, resulting in a more direct and ongoing dialogue with consumers. Digital engagement strategies have proven time and again that they can yield stronger one-on-one relationships with consumers. In turn, these relationships create communities of loyal, engaged audiences, which \u2013 in combination with engaging content \u2013 contribute heavily to brand success.\n\nThe problem, though, is that the success tends to be short-lived. While DTC darlings like Warby Parker and Casper experienced early success, they and other DTC brands are in danger of being stuck in venture purgatory. For one thing, these companies have learned that they have to build their own loyal followings \u2013 they can no longer just \u201cbuy\u201d them \u2013 and this is a process that takes significant resources, capital, and time.\n\nAdditionally, these companies have raised so much capital that they have to be hyper-focused on generating top-line revenue growth to validate valuations that satisfy their VC backers. These factors, combined with limited product diversity, makes it difficult to develop disciplined operational habits and achieve sustainable growth. Based on these challenges, a new approach is warranted.\n\nCredit: Casper Casper is one the best known DTC brands, but is it running on borrowed time?\n\nThe reemergence of the holding company model\n\nOne approach that is working well is a holding company model, where young companies with a DTC approach can take the learnings that the P&Gs and Unilevers of the past created and reimagine it for today\u2019s market. Companies like Harry\u2019s and Glossier are two success stories, both embracing the holding company model as an opportunity to create a portfolio of products and leverage owned audiences and shared resources across their portfolios.\n\nHarry\u2019s raised $112 million last February to move beyond just shaving products and set its sights on competing on an even playing field with Procter & Gamble, Gilette\u2019s parent company. Shortly after executing this strategy, Edgewell acquired Harry\u2019s for $1.37 billion because of Harry\u2019s next-generation holding company approach, product innovation through their \u201cHarry\u2019s Labs and Ventures\u201d arm and the ability to revitalize Edgewell\u2019s dated holding company environment\n\nSimilarly, digital-first beauty brand Glossier reached unicorn status last year by building the brand from consumers up rather than brand down. Glossier also recently launched Glossier Play, the first of many additional brands that the company will likely bring to market.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nLooking ahead, the brands that pivot to a holding company model will need to prioritize the following to be successful:\n\nEmbrace the right structure \u2014 Brands need to structure themselves with a portfolio of brands from day one, as opposed to starting out with one or two brands and leaning on a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach. This requires thoughtful ownership considerations from the launch stage of any brand.\n\n\u2014 Brands need to structure themselves with a portfolio of brands from day one, as opposed to starting out with one or two brands and leaning on a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach. This requires thoughtful ownership considerations from the launch stage of any brand. Leverage customer data \u2014 Brands need to understand the importance and value of data. Major companies like Nestle and Nike are proof positive that customer data matters. Last spring, Nestle embedded SAS Analytics into key business processes and Nike recently bought a data science company to better serve consumers personally at a global scale.\n\n\u2014 Brands need to understand the importance and value of data.

As brands find initial success and scale, they must stay nimble in how they build their operational processes and deploy resources. This is particularly important as multiple opportunities become available once momentum is gained.\n\n\u2014 Brands need to move with speed and dexterity in how they operate and pursue growth.

Brands should stay open to outsourcing any capabilities that are not core to the business in order to streamline processes and maximize efficiencies.\n\nThe evolution of today\u2019s holding company approach has been far from a straight line.
