Of course, with theater, the space is limited, but for all my previous films we had a lot of locations; like Okja starts in the deep mountainside [of Korea] and ends in Manhattan. So I was thinking, what story could I tell with just two houses? I came up with the idea of a poor house and a rich house, because at the time I was working on the post-production of Snowpiercer, so I was really enveloped in this story about the gap between the rich and the poor.\n\nAside from Snowpiercer and theater, I was fascinated with this idea of infiltration. When I was in college, I tutored for a rich family and I got this feeling that I was infiltrating the private lives of complete strangers. Every week I would go into their house, and I thought how fun it would be if I could get all my friends to infiltrate the house one by one.\n\nSims: You\u2019ve worked in the world of allegorical sci-fi and fantasy in recent years; did you consciously want to move away from harder genre films while keeping up the allegory?\n\nBong: Sci-fi gives you the advantage of being able to say what you want pretty directly. Like in Snowpiercer, that scene where Ed Harris has a long monologue in the engine car. Parasite has the landscape stone [a gift given early in the film that becomes crucial to the plot]. The movie has symbols, but I wanted to focus more on the mundane atmosphere, on the stories of our neighbors.\n\nSims: But Parasite still has the quality of a haunted-house story.\n\nBong: Yes, it\u2019s still a genre movie, and there is some kind of ghost story. In this story, the characters treat a normal person like a ghost, so you can say that\u2019s social commentary [and] a genre element. I think in my films it\u2019s always difficult to separate the two.\n\nSims: So many of your films are about people contending with monsters they don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s going on in Parasite as well; there\u2019s a gulf these two families can\u2019t breach.\n\nBong: I haven\u2019t heard this comment in a while! If you think about it, my films are always based on misunderstanding\u2014the audience is the one who knows more, and the characters have a difficult time communicating with each other. I think sadness and comedy all come from that misunderstanding, so as an audience member, you feel bad, you want to step up and reconcile them. As a filmmaker, I always try and shoot with sympathy. We don\u2019t have any villains in Parasite, but in the end, with all these misunderstandings, they end up hurting each other.\n\nSims: The design of the two houses is everything for the story\u2014it sets up how these families exist so differently. How did you approach that?", "description": "\u201cIt all came to me, and I wrote like it was a hurricane.\u201d", "authors": ["David Sims"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/h_15036402/facebook.jpg?1571152006", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
