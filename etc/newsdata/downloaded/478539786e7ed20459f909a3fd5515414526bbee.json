Holiday is precious so we were ready to take the five days to come here and now we think, hmmm,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s nice to see Tokyo but we came mainly for the World Cup, so very disappointed.\u201d\n\nMany fans also face disruption to organised tours, which revolve around the games, while hundreds of domestic flights have already been cancelled.\n\nMore than 100 flights were grounded when Typhoon Faxai \u2014 much smaller than Hagibis \u2014 hit Japan before the World Cup, leaving two people dead and cutting power to half-a-million homes.\n\n\u2013 \u201810,000 miles for a cancelled match\u2019 \u2013\n\nCatherine, a French tour guide who has lived in Japan for about 20 years, questioned the wisdom of holding the World Cup in typhoon season. Tokyo will also host the Summer Olympics next July and August.\n\n\u201cWhy are they holding the World Cup now, when everyone knows there are typhoons?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it.\n\n\u201cWhy are the Olympics in the height of summer when everyone\u2019s going to die of heat?\u201d\n\nEnglishman Paul Moore, 61, who lives in typhoon-prone Hong Kong, said it was the right decision to cancel the two games on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI know how bad typhoons can be\u2026 I\u2019m disappointed but it\u2019s the right decision,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a super typhoon so it\u2019s one of the big ones.\u201d\n\nAsked what he planned to do instead of going to the game, Moore said: \u201cFind a bar! Because there are other games still on so we\u2019ll find a bar somewhere.\u201d\n\nIt was a common solution raised by fans, although many of Tokyo\u2019s bars will be shut when the storm hits and it will be dangerous to venture outdoors.\n\nFlavia Spena, an Italian who lives in New Zealand, was disappointed to miss out on a rare match between the two countries.\n\n\u201cWe are very disappointed that it has been cancelled, but we understand that a typhoon is something very serious. But as a fan coming all the way, it\u2019s a little bit sad,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Chris, an English fan from Gloucester who was visiting with his brother and three friends, it was a long way to come for a match that isn\u2019t taking place.\n\n\u201c(We\u2019ve) made such a long journey, travelled 10,000 miles (16,000 kilometres) for a cancelled match,\u201d he said, sipping a beer to ease the pain.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Thousands of fans were left disappointed on Thursday as an approaching typhoon forced Rugby World Cup organisers to cancel two games, spoiling their trip to Japan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/JAPPY7159_RTRMADP_3_RUGBY-UNION-WORLD-SCOTLAND-JAPAN_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
