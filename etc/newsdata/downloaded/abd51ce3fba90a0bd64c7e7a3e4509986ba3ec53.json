We\u2019re all human. We\u2019re gonna die. The contemplative nature of it has to do with an accumulation of detail. Details, details.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a good thing for our culture to be able to take the time and experience it. You may like it, you may dislike it. But things move so fast now.\u2019\n\n\u2018We see the result of that in what\u2019s happened to our country. We get a soundbite without context. People are too busy. It\u2019s time to take time.\u2019\n\nAnd it took ages to get Scorsese, Pacino and De Niro together for a film.\n\nThe Irishman is their first film as a trio and that alone feel like a last salute to the ever-changing landscape cinema.\n\nOne where Scorsese\u2019s kind of detailed, three-hour plus movies have all withered away to binge-ready entertainment.\n\nDe Niro pushed for The Irishman from the start after he became drawn to Charles Brandt\u2019s book about Sheeran, \u2018I Heard You Paint Houses.\u2019\n\nPictured: De Niro as he appears during The Irishman trailer that stunned audiences with its age defying digital technology\n\nTo him, it held the potential to allow a more introspective peek into the world of organized crime that he, Scorsese, and Joe Pesci (who plays Mafia don Russell Bufalino) are so ingrained in.\n\nIt took a decade to see this vision onto the big screen and that\u2019s in part due to the improved digital de-aging effects allowing actors to perform a lifetime.\n\nIt also didn\u2019t hurt that Netflix backed the film with $159 million to create the film.\n\n'We couldn\u2019t have asked for anything more.\u2019 De Niro said. \u2018Period. That\u2019s it.\u2019\n\nPacino agreed, saying: \u2018It really was an exceptional kind of situation. It was funny. Marty, there, Bob. It was so easy. It\u2019s what we do.\u2019\n\nPacino (right): 'It really was an exceptional kind of situation. It was funny. Marty, there, Bob. It was so easy. It\u2019s what we do.'\n\nAnd as the The Irishman received rave reviews at the New York Film Festival, the three men shared a moment of raw joy as they banded together for final bang on the gong.\n\nScorsese and De Niro have a long history of collaborations that ended in nine feature films, but it\u2019s been quite a while.\n\nAlmost 24 years to the day the award winning, 1995 movie \u2018Casino' released.\n\nSomehow, Pacino never made a movie with Scorsese and he likens the experience to walking a high wire \u2018only Marty was the net.\u2019\n\nThe two man came close, though.\n\n\u2018Al, I always wanted to work with. We met through Francis Coppola,' says Scorsese.\n\n\u2018By the time other projects came up, I didn\u2019t have the cachet, or certain types of stories, you had already covered the territory, like in \"Scarface\" or \u201cCarlito\u2019s Way\u201d.\u2019\n\nPacino says: \u2018The big one I wanted to do \u2014 there was a lot of them \u2014 was the Modigliani.\u2019\n\nThe Irishman released at the New York Film Festival to rave reviews and praise for the three men's direction and performance\n\nScorsese agrees the script was good, but he reminds Pacino that the 1980s was a time the director was struggling to find studios to support him.\n\nScorsese says: \u2018What happened is that the whole industry changed. We opened \u201cRaging Bull\u201d nine or ten days before the same studio, UA, released \u201cHeaven\u2019s Gate\u201d.\u2019\n\n\u2018And then \u201cHeaven\u2019s Gate\u201d was closed by one review from The New York Times and that was the end of what\u2019s derogatorily, unfortunately, referred to as the \u201cauteur\u201d cinema of America. It was destroyed.'\n\nScorsese begins to talk about the difficulties he faced getting \u2018The Last Temptation of Christ\u2019 made.\n\nDe Niro and Pacino play real life men - Frank Sheeran (right) and Jimmy Hoffa (left) who became involved with organized crime to fight the corruption of worker unions\n\nIt was initially cancelled a few weeks before shooting before its debut in 1988.\n\n\u2018I took that as a voice shouting out to me, \u201cLeave Los Angeles!\u201d So I came back to New York and started over again,\u2019 Scorsese says.\n\n\u2018I saw that at the Ziegfeld,\u2019 Pacino cuts in.\n\n\u2018Amazing. They don\u2019t have the Ziegfeld anymore.\u2019\n\nThe loss of the iconic New York City movie theater in one of many things that has transformed for film making in the years since.\n\nThe Irishman is Scorsese\u2019s second film with Netflix this year and, as he repeatedly explained, they were the only one\u2019s willing to pay for it.\n\nHis new film is a poignant stake in Scorsese\u2019s criticism of the movie landscape pandering to blockbuster-dominated Hollywood.\n\nHe believes movies are worth more than pacifying audiences.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s all been about servicing the audience and not challenging them. Challenging a bit \u2014 maybe more than a bit \u2014 enriches the audience. And it enriches our children. Don\u2019t make the audience adolescent or childlike. The audience is ahead of you,\u2019 Scorsese says.\n\nNetflix will release The Irishman for a three-week exclusive run in theaters before dropping it on the streaming site on November 27.\n\nPictured: De Niro (left), Pacino (middle) and Ray Romano as Bill Bufalino (right) in The Irishman\n\nScorsese admits that The Irishman is more somber and subtle than his previous gangster movies \"GoodFellas\" or \"Casino.\"\n\nHe says: \u2018It may be in dialogue with those films. \u201cGoodFellas\u201d is on one level and \u201cCasino\u201d takes it another level. And that level ends it, in a way, at the end of \u201cCasino\u201d. It\u2019s the end of that time and that enthusiasm for that world.\u2019\n\nOn a different level than those films, The Irishman suggests there\u2019s a world outside the greed, corruption and violence of earlier crime films \u2013 one not lost on De Niro, Pacino or Scorsese.\n\nWhen they see each other, they say, their conversations aren\u2019t hinged on movies.\n\n'We talk about our kids,' says De Niro.\n\n'It\u2019s about living, really,' says Scorsese.\n\nAnd: \u2018How do I get a doctor in this city?,' adds Pacino as they all cackle.\n\n'That\u2019s the other thing!' Scorsese exclaims. '\n\nDoctors, medication. Oh, you\u2019ve got that, too! Oh no!'", "description": "Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino opened up about working together for the first time on Netflix's The Irishman, a movie following mafia hit man Frank Sheeran as he reflects on his life", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/16/20385638-0-image-a-2_1572452447930.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
