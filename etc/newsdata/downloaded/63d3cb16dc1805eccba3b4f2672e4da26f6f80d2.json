REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/File Photo\n\nFor Lazard, Pigasse has led the world\u2019s largest sovereign debt restructurings in Greece, Argentina and Ukraine, as well as multi-billion mergers such as those between Unibail-Rodamco and Westfield, Sanofi and Boehringer Ingelheim, Safran and Zodiac.\n\n\u201cI am excited to begin my next chapter beyond investment banking in a new entrepreneurial project,\u201d Lazard cited Pigasse as saying.\n\nPigasse has been reflecting on his future for about eight months, a source close to the banker said, adding that he took the decision only in the last few days. Lazard did not want to let him go, the source said, but Pigasse needed a new challenge.\n\nHis departure follows rumors about the future of the flamboyant 51-year-old Pigasse, a punk rock aficionado who has deep relationships with members of the French establishment.\n\nReuters reported earlier this month that he had talked to several U.S. boutique investment banks.\n\nIn May this year, Lazard announced a reshuffle of its senior leadership, with Pigasse named global head of banking and deputy CEO of financial advisory, while also retaining his job as chairman and chief executive of Lazard France.\n\nLazard CEO Kenneth Jacobs said at the time that Pigasse was \u201ccentral to our success in France and elsewhere\u201d and that his new focus would be to help the firm\u2019s new CEO of financial advisory, Peter Orszag, win more business globally.\n\n\u201cIt was not my decision, it was Matthieu\u2019s decision (to resign),\u201d Jacobs, who is in Paris, told Reuters on Sunday in a statement sent via a Lazard spokesperson.\n\nPigasse is well-known in Paris business and media circles due to his shareholding in newspaper Le Monde and business interests in Radio Nova and Les Inrockuptibles cultural magazine.\n\nHe joined Lazard as a managing director in 2002, becoming its youngest ever partner.\n\nThe bank said it would announce a new leadership team in France shortly.", "description": "French banker Matthieu Pigasse is to leave Lazard after 17 years to pursue a new entrepreneurial project, an exit that will see the firm lose one of its biggest rainmakers.", "authors": ["Gw\u00e9na\u00eblle Barzic", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443115508&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0M7", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
