REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\n\nTrudeau came to power in 2015 promising \u201csunny ways\u201d and a new way of doing politics but saw his popularity drop earlier this year amid an ethics scandal. Images of him in blackface emerged last month, further hurting his Liberal Party ahead of the Oct. 21 election.\n\nThe 47-year-old prime minister, his voice increasingly hoarse, said Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer would slash spending and rip up Liberal plans to fight climate change.\n\nPolls show the Liberals and the Conservatives in a dead heat, with neither able to capture a majority of the 338 seats in the House of Commons. This would leave the winner in a vulnerable position, seeking to govern with smaller parties.\n\n\u201cI know Canadians want a strong progressive government that would stop Conservative cuts,\u201d Trudeau told a rally in a fire station in the Ontario city of Hamilton, to the west of Toronto.\n\nIn the absence of an overriding narrative, dirty tactics and awkward moments have characterized the campaign.\n\nA Nanos Research poll for the Globe and Mail and CTV released on Saturday put the Liberals at 32.6% public support and the main official Conservatives at 30.3%. The left-leaning New Democrats, who compete for the same voters as the Liberals, were at 18.4%.\n\nTrudeau sidestepped questions about his plans if he did not win a majority. Minority governments in Canada rarely last more than two and a half years.\n\nScheer, speaking in Toronto, said Trudeau would spend his first 100 days negotiating a coalition with the New Democrats that would impose tax hikes.\n\n\u201cJustin Trudeau has made it clear he will pay any price to stay in power, and he will use your money to do it,\u201d he told reporters. There has only been one coalition in Canadian history, in 1917 during World War One.\n\nTrudeau and Scheer made multiple trips to Ontario, which accounts for 108 of the 338 seats in the House of Commons. The Liberals hold 76 of those seats.\n\nTrudeau was scheduled to make four stops in Ontario before flying later on Saturday to the western provinces of Manitoba and Alberta, where anger against the Liberals is rising over government environmental measures that critics complain will hobble the energy industry.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, facing the loss of his Parliamentary majority in an election next week, traded attacks with his main rival on Saturday as a bad-tempered campaign entered the last few days.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442715627&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0FX", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
