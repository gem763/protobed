International borrowing is up, and the country is having trouble paying back its loans. But Maduro and his government remain confident that cryptocurrencies will help the country find a way out of its financial quagmire.\n\nPer a report from Ultimas Noticias and an article published by NTN24, Maduro is planning to use cryptocurrencies to pay off debts to the country\u2019s two biggest creditors, China and Russia.\n\nSpeaking in a live TV address, Maduro stated,\n\n\u201cWe will negotiate [with our creditors] using cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nThe president added that he would reveal further details of his crypto payment plans \u201cin the next few days.\u201d\n\nAlthough the government has developed its own oil-backed cryptocurrency named the Petro, Moscow earlier this year rejected the notion of dealing in Maduro\u2019s token. Beijing is also believed to be lukewarm about the Petro \u2013 mainly because of the severity of the United States sanctions that have been placed on states and companies dealing with the token.\n\nHowever, as previously reported, the Venezuelan state is believed to be \u201csitting on a stash\u201d of Bitcoin and Ethereum tokens accrued by one of its oil producers \u2013 and could feasibly look to use these and other cryptocurrency holdings should Russia and China show willingness.\n\nMaduro stated that the American sanctions have left Venezuela with no choice other than to \u201crenegotiate\u201d with its creditors. The president said that \u201cfinancial transactions have been complicated with the rest of the world,\u201d but added that his cryptocurrency-powered plan will help the country \u201cmaintain [the flow of] imports and exports.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Joselit Ram\u00edrez, the head of Sunacrip, the Venezuelan government\u2019s cryptocurrency agency, has stated that the Petro can now be used in domestic real estate contracts. Per Noticas24, Ram\u00edrez stated that Petro housing deals are now incentivized, and claimed that a landowner had already paid for a contractor to build a house in the oil-backed token.\n\nRam\u00edrez said,", "description": "Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro says his country is working on an international and domestic payments system that will make use of cryptocurrencies.
