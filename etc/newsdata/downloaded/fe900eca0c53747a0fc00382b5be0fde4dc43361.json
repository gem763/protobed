A barrel of Brent traded up $5.33 to $65.55.\n\nThat spike represented the biggest percentage value jump in Brent crude since the lead up to the 1991 Gulf War that saw a U.S.-led coalition expel Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces from Kuwait.\n\nU.S. benchmark West Texas crude was up around 8%. U.S. gasoline and heating oil similarly were up over 8% and 7% respectively before markets opened in New York.\n\nSaturday\u2019s attack halted production of 5.7 million barrels of crude a day, more than half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s global daily exports and more than 5% of the world\u2019s daily crude oil production. Most of that output goes to Asia.\n\nAt 5.7 million barrels of crude oil a day, the Saudi disruption would be the greatest on record for world markets, according to figures from the Paris-based International Energy Agency. It just edges out the 5.6 million-barrels-a-day disruption around the time of Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution, according to the IEA.\n\nSaudi Arabia has pledged that its stockpiles would keep global markets supplied as it rushes to repair damage at the Abqaiq facility and its Khurais oil field.\n\nTrump said the U.S. had reason to believe it knows who was behind the attack - his secretary of state had blamed Iran the previous day. He assured his Twitter followers that \u201cwe are \u2026 locked and loaded\u201d depending on verification and were waiting to hear from the Saudis as to who they believe was behind the attack and \u201cunder what terms we would proceed!\u201d\n\nThe tweets followed a National Security Council meeting at the White House that included Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper.\n\nA U.S. official said all options, including a military response, were on the table, but said no decisions had been made Sunday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201clocked and loaded\u201d comment mirrors similar remarks he made following Iran shooting down a U.S. military surveillance drone in June. However, the president said he pulled back from retaliating against Iran at the last minute.\n\nU.S. officials also offered highly detailed satellite photos of the Saudi sites that show damage suggesting the attack came from the north, where Iran or Iraq are, rather than from Yemen to the south. Iraq\u2019s prime minister has denied the attack came from his country, where Iranian-backed Shiite rebels operate. Iraqi Premier Adel Abdel-Mahdi said he received a call Monday from Pompeo, without elaborating.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi on Sunday dismissed the U.S. allegations as \u201cblind and futile comments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Americans adopted the \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 policy against Iran, which, due to its failure, is leaning toward \u2018maximum lies,\u2019\u201d Mousavi said.\n\nOn Monday, Mousavi dismissed as mere \u201cspeculation\u201d media reports about a possible meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly later in September. The U.S. has said it will remain open for talks with Iran but Mousavi said a Trump-Rouhani meeting was not on the agenda.\n\nThe U.S. satellite photos appear to show the attack on Abqaiq may have struck the most-sensitive part of the facility, its stabilization area. The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies has said the area includes \u201cstorage tanks and processing and compressor trains - which greatly increases the likelihood of a strike successfully disrupting or destroying its operations.\u201d\n\nStabilization means processing so-called sour crude oil into sweet crude. That allows it to be transported onto transshipment points on the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, or to refineries for local production.\n\nThe attack \u201cdamaged five to seven spheroids and five out of ten stabilization towers,\u201d said Fernando Ferreira, the director of geopolitical risk at the Washington-based Rapidan Energy Group.\n\nFive \u201cor so stabilization towers appear to be destroyed and will have to be rebuilt - this will take many months,\u201d Ferreira said. \u201cThe sophisticated attack now seems likely to reduce Abqaiq\u2019s 7 (million barrels of crude oil a day) capacity for an indefinite period\u201d measured in months.\n\nSaudi Aramco did not respond to questions from The Associated Press regarding damage at Abqaiq and the satellite images.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Zeke Miller in Washington; Tali Arbel in New York; Elaine Kurtenbach in Bangkok; Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran and Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Global energy prices spiked on Monday after a weekend attack on key oil facilities in Saudi Arabia caused the worst disruption to world supplies on record, an assault for which President Donald Trump warned that the U.S. was \"locked and loaded\" to respond.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jon Gambrell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/persian_gulf_tensions_29447_c0-242-6000-3740_s1770x1032.jpg?3fa81245a29dcc55f35bc0fa2279c23c8ee99f6e", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
