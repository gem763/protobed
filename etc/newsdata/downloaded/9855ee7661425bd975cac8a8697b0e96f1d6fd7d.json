She and I, and former beauty editor Kathy Phillips, were discussing deodorant. What follows is an exchange, not from fantasy, but, if you can believe it, from life itself.\n\nMe: \u201cWhat deodorant do you use?\u201d\n\nNewby: \u201cI rarely use one. I have many problems, but body odor is not one of them.\u201d\n\nKathy: \u201cAre you using lemon, Newby? I have for years. No deo for me either.\u201d\n\nBut by this point, I was no longer conscious. Lemons? Really?\n\nI stopped wearing standard antiperspirant more than a decade ago. Like a college freshman trying on vegetarianism, I have experimented with body odor\u2013repellants of every kind, from the rock crystal to the Jasons and Schmidts. I\u2019ve even taken chlorophyll tablets, which is known to quell odors of all kinds \u2014 foot, underarm, even halitosis. And now, another edible-cum-deoderant intrigued me.\n\nIn a trance, I went to my refrigerator, opened the produce drawer and pulled out a lemon, already sliced into two halves, stored in a ziplock, probably having been squeezed onto some noodle dish or something. I rubbed one half along my underarm as if it were the roller head of Dry Idea.\n\nAfter wiping away a few lingering bits of pulp, I took a whiff, smiled at the pleasing familiar smell, and got dressed.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Manhattanite, you know this summer has had more than its share of soupy, muggy, sweaty scorching days, but it\u2019s been about five or six weeks since I started using lemons, and my armpits remain blissfully unaware of the disgusting conditions surrounding them.\n\nNow, you might be wondering, What about stress sweat? Passed! A few weeks ago, I hosted a chat with Maggie Gyllenhaal. I don\u2019t usually fare well with celebrity interviews (I once interviewed Madonna and pretty much made a fool of myself, fumbling with my questions and even saying \u201cYou rock\u201d after one of her innocuous answers. And this was over the phone.), and while my mouth may have experienced a mild misstep or two, my armpits sat quietly by and behaved.\n\nGiven the fruit\u2019s high level of acidity, I asked dermatologist Amy Wechsler whether she\u2019d endorse this action.\n\n\u201cLemon is way too acidic to rub on the skin!\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cIt can cause major irritation, and underarm skin is particularly sensitive \u2014 so it\u2019s a no from me!\u201d\n\nI lifted my shirt and looked in the bathroom mirror. No signs of irritation but a skin tag or two. I decided to ask a breast cancer specialist.\n\n\u201cI am unaware of any effect of lemon juice deodorant on axillary lymph nodes or breast health,\u201d says Kimberly Feigin, radiologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center. \u201cTheoretically, if the skin became irritated, that could cause the lymph nodes to react or enlarge, but any direct effect on the nodes themselves seems unlikely.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s enough of an endorsement for me.\n\nOn Fresh Direct, lemons cost 89 cents, or five for a dollar. Since I plan on altering my routine from halving to slicing, I figure each lemon should last me about a week, maybe ten days. Doing the math, my new citrus plan will still cost more than even an expensive luxury deodorant, but I don\u2019t care. The Earth mother in me has waved her freak flag proudly and confidently.", "description": "You are a nature goddess, and your armpits smell great.", "authors": ["Jane Larkworthy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/08/01/01-lemon-deodorant.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
