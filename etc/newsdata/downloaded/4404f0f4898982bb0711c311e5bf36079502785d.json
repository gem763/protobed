We have been able to add a bit more on our team togetherness and cohesion too.\n\n\"Now it is about putting in a game plan against Tonga and it is important to be tactically right. We know they are going to be ferocious and full of pride and passion.\n\n\"They are a side that if they get a bit of momentum they can be very dangerous and are well-coached by Toutai Kefu.\n\n\"They have a great World Cup record and we will need to be at our best on Sunday.\n\nEngland (15-1)\n\nElliot Daly; Anthony Watson, Manu Tuilagi, Owen Farrell (capt), Jonny May; George Ford, Ben Youngs; Billy Vunipola, Sam Underhill, Tom Curry; Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes; Kyle Sinckler, Jamie George, Joe Marler\n\nReplacements: Luke Cowan-Dickie, Ellis Genge, Dan Cole, George Kruis, Lewis Ludlam, Willi Heinz, Henry Slade, Jonathan Joseph", "description": "England have paid Tonga the compliment of selecting their strongest available side for the teams' World Cup Pool C opener at the Sapporo Dome on Sunday.
