Who would candidate Donald Trump take down this week? How would he dominate media questioners yet again?\n\nWhether you were for Trump, appalled by him or just curious, each debate was worth watching.\n\nDEBATE DESCENDS INTO MELEE OVER HEALTH CARE, OBAMA, SOCIALISM AS DEMS STRUGGLE TO SHOW UNITY\n\nTrump was so different \u2013 and so cheerfully direct and aggressive \u2013 that people began to see the debates as a sort of reality TV (which is what they should be). Our country is better when more people want to watch political debates and participate in elections.\n\nBy contrast, Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate was a bore, with an old-time politician tone that made it painful to sit through.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes of policy-wonk jargon about incomprehensible details of health policy, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., remarked: \"This discussion has given the American people a headache.\"\n\nLike or dislike Trump, I can\u2019t imagine a participant in a Trump-energized presidential debate saying \u2013 as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg did \u2013 that the debates \"are becoming unwatchable.\"\n\nThe most revealing moment of the debate may have been former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s comment that to help poor children learn more words, parents should \u201cmake sure you have the record player on at night.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIt may be tricky for Democrats if they nominate someone in 2020 who is mentally in a world of record players. It will be quite difficult to try to be the party of the future when you have a candidate of the past.\n\nSimilarly, the more radical candidates \u2013 virtually everyone other than the two semi-moderates, Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. \u2013 seemed to be in a contest to alienate the most Americans.\n\nJust in case the talk about \"Medicare-for-all,\" getting rid of private insurance, defunding charter schools and the usual left-wing radicalism wasn\u2019t enough, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas set the classic example of driving away voters and alienating entire regions of the country.\n\nSimilarly, the more radical candidates \u2013 virtually everyone other than the two semi-moderates, Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. \u2013 seemed to be in a contest to alienate the most Americans.\n\nWhen debate moderator David Muir of ABC News questioned O\u2019Rourke about his recent comments about firearms bans and confiscations, Muir asked bluntly: \"Are you proposing taking away their guns?\"\n\nApparently, O\u2019Rourke wanted to make absolutely certain that the millions of law-abiding Americans who own guns would understand that his candidacy was a mortal threat to their freedom and Second Amendment rights.\n\n\"Hell, yes, we're going to take away your AR-15, your AK-47,\" O'Rourke said.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also reminded millions of Americans about her elitist isolation from most people when she said: \"I've actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company.\"\n\nWarren\u2019s comment is quite revealing since the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that 58 percent of Americans oppose a health care policy plan that would force them to give up the private insurance option. Only 37 percent favored getting rid of all private health insurance.\n\nMeanwhile, support for \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d continues to drop when Americans\u2019 are told it would raise their taxes (37 percent), threaten the current Medicare program (32 percent), and cause delays in treatment (26 percent).\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWarren, of course, represents the 37 percent. President Trump would (and will) be happy to defend the 58 percent.\n\nEvery time there is another boring, wonkish and disconnected Democratic debate like this, the 2020 Trump victory will become bigger and bigger.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH", "description": "Thursday's Democratic debate was bizarre, boring and painful to sit through.
