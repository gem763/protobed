Will Kim Jong Un show up?", "language": "en", "text": "Two years later, he fled North Korea for a new life in the South.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jung, who trains in a Nike jersey and Adidas cleats with an amateur club, plans to root for his adopted home as the two Koreas face off in a qualifier match in Pyongyang for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than just a ballgame; it\u2019s a metaphor for the Korean War,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nThe neighbors \u2014 at once bitter enemies and long-lost brethren \u2014 have contested soccer games in the past. But political sensitivities have prevented the South Korean men\u2019s national team from playing in North Korea since 1990, when the two sides met for a friendly in Pyongyang for the first time since the peninsula\u2019s division.\n\n\u201cIt was a nervous arrival in unknown territory, and Pyongyang citizens carried us on their shoulders from the airport,\u201d said Kim Joo-sung, the former South Korean midfielder who scored the first goal in that match. North Korea won, 2-1, but Kim said he had no regrets because his team wanted \u201cto give peace a chance.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis week\u2019s game takes place as tensions rise once again on the peninsula, giving the encounter added gravity.\n\nPyongyang resumed weapons testing in July amid a deadlock in nuclear talks with Washington. And North Korea has suspended virtually all diplomatic exchanges with the South in recent months. It has not responded to Seoul\u2019s calls to discuss a live broadcast of the game and how or whether to allow South Korean spectators to enter North Korea for the match, South Korean soccer officials said.\n\nAD\n\nAs of Friday, it was not clear whether fans in South Korea would be able to watch the game live, and the country\u2019s soccer authorities conceded that it might not be possible.\n\nNo matter the political complexities, the South Korean team is gearing up for a serious competition against its northern neighbor to qualify for the 2022 World Cup.\n\nAD\n\nPaulo Bento, South Korea\u2019s head coach, told reporters in late September that he \u201ctries to understand what feelings South Korean people have toward this match.\u201d But, he added, \u201cthe important thing is to concentrate on the game and earn points.\u201d\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s 25-member squad, which includes top athletes who compete in the English Premier League, Germany\u2019s Bundesliga and Spain\u2019s La Liga, convened in recent days to train for the match.\n\n\u201cWe are not traveling [to Pyongyang] for leisure,\u201d captain Son Heung-min, who also plays for the Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur, told reporters Oct. 7. \u201cOur only focus is the faceoff itself.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCompared with the South\u2019s globe-trotting stars, most of the North Korean players are unknown outside of their domestic league. Still, they train with each other day-to-day and could prove to be stronger as a team than their rivals, said Kim Kyung-sung, head of the South and North Korean Sports Exchange Association.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSouth Korean players might excel in personal skills, but the North Korean brothers will strike back with ironclad teamwork,\u201d he said.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s captain is 26-year-old Jong Il Gwan, whose goals gave North Korea a 2-0 win in its first Asian qualifier match against Lebanon on Sept. 5. With a subsequent 1-0 win over Sri Lanka, North Korea rose to the top of its qualifying group.\n\nThe North Korean team hasn\u2019t lost at Kim Il Sung Stadium since 2005, when it failed to qualify for the World Cup in a match against Iran and angry North Korean fans hurled bottles and cans at referees and the Iranian players.\n\nAD\n\nIt remains to be seen whether North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will attend Tuesday, though he has been to events there before.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf Kim Jong Un comes to see the match, the North Koreans will play do-or-die-soccer to win, as the triumph will be attributed to the leader\u2019s glory,\u201d said Kim Kyung-sung.\n\nThe match holds significance beyond the field for North Korea. Under Kim Jong Un, North Korea has made unprecedented investment to raise the country\u2019s soccer profile and compete internationally.\n\nIn 2013, North Korea sent a group of handpicked young talent to an academy in Italy; the same year, it established the Pyongyang International Football School to train hundreds of aspiring players. In 2016, the men\u2019s national team hired Norwegian-born footballer Jorn Andersen as coach. (He later left, saying economic hardships made it impossible to stay in the country.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAntonio Razzi, a former senator in Italy who helped connect young North Korean footballers to ISM Academy in Corciano, said that Kim Jong Un likes soccer and that during the young leader\u2019s formative years in Switzerland, Kim watched Inter Milan games at San Siro Stadium.\n\nAmong the men Razzi connected to the academy is Han Kwang Song, who recently signed with Juventus\u2019s under-23 team and who has been on the North Korean team\u2019s roster for the World Cup qualifiers. Razzi said that Han\u2019s presence at the Italian club was \u201ca nice step forward for peace\u201d and that the young player plans to bring a Juventus jersey to Kim Jong Un.\n\nAs for the prospect of the match Tuesday leading to political breakthroughs off the field, Kim Kyung-sung pointed to the success of the 2018 Winter Olympics in helping to break the ice between North and South Korea.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis soccer match can open up a dialogue for peaceful resolution of North Korean nuclear tension, just like how the Olympic truce in PyeongChang led to the historic inter-Korean summit last year,\u201d he said.\n\nJung, the North Korean defector, said that although he will support the South Korean team, he hopes one day to return to Hamhung and play soccer with his former teammates.\n\n\u201cI want to kick balls with them and see how much we have grown,\u201d he said.\n\nStefano Pitrelli in Rome contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The two Koreas have had unified teams in some sports, but they remain major rivals in soccer.", "authors": ["Min Joo Kim", "Assistant Reporter In Seoul Covering South", "North Korea."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7qDLEDnOTRXW3lP6vG4vkiJtlms=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DACVJWXL4YI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
