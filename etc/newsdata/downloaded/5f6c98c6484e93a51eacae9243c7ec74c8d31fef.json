He\u2019ll be making a a campaign announcement this Saturday and looks forward to speaking with folks then.\u201d\n\nWeld, who served as governor from 1991 to 1997, waged an unsuccessful bid for Senate in 1996, trying to unseat then Sen. John F. Kerry. Weld is currently seeking the Republican presidential nomination, taking on President Trump. His strategy involves trying to win New Hampshire, where he\u2019s been heavily campaigning. There have been few public polls of the Republican primary in New Hampshire, but an April survey showed Trump more than 60 percentage points ahead of Weld.\n\nDuring his conversation with reporters, Weld ruled out running on the Libertarian ticket or as an independent if he fails to secure the GOP nomination. In 2016, Weld clinched the Libertarian Party\u2019s nod for vice president and ran on a ticket with Gary Johnson.\n\nWeld avoided offering any endorsements on the Democratic side, but shared some thoughts about the candidates.\n\nAbout fellow Bay Stater Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Weld said: \u201cShe sure is smart and she sure is filled with energy.\u201d But he added that her economic policies are too far left for the country and predicted she would lose in a general election.\n\nWeld sounded more impressed with former vice president Joe Biden, who is atop most of the Democratic polls. \u201cI\u2019ve known Biden the longest of any of these folks,\u201d Weld said.", "description": "Weld, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, told The Washington Post that he has known Kennedy \u201csince the day he was born.\u201d", "authors": ["Annie Linskey", "National Political Reporter Focused On The Presidential Campaign"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JGD7A3G3BMI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
