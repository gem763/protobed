For years, few financial managers factored in human rights. But as Beijing becomes more repressive at home and more aggressive about enforcing political loyalty aboard, that calculation is changing.\n\n\u201cI think American businesses are waking up to the risks,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cIt may seem that [doing business in China] makes profit in the short run, but the cost, the reputational cost to these companies, I think, will prove to be higher and higher as Beijing\u2019s long arm reaches out to them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut did you know that millions of Americans are \u2014 often unwittingly \u2014 betting their financial futures on the future success of the Chinese government\u2019s strategy? Without much oversight or consideration of the risks, Wall Street institutions are steering trillions of American investors\u2019 dollars toward Chinese companies that are complicit in China\u2019s military expansion and gross human rights abuses.\n\nCongress is now making an effort to force these Wall Street firms to stop exposing American investors\u2019 financial futures to Chinese companies that are not only beholden to the Chinese Communist Party but also in many cases directly involved in repression. The Chinese government is hoping Americans don\u2019t realize what\u2019s going on until it\u2019s too late.\n\nIn August, Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) wrote to Michael Kennedy, the chairman of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB), which administers the pensions of more than 5 million federal employees and military service members. They demanded he reverse the board\u2019s decision to steer more than $50 billion in the federal Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) toward China.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2017, the board decided to have the TSP\u2019s international stock fund mirror the MSCI All Country World ex-USA Investable Market Index, beginning next year. MSCI, the world\u2019s largest index provider, has been steadily increasing its holdings of Chinese assets, reportedly under severe pressure from the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cThe FRTIB\u2019s decision to track this MSCI index constitutes a decision to invest in China-based companies, including many firms that are involved in the Chinese Government\u2019s military, espionage, human rights abuses, and \u2018Made in China 2025\u2019 industrial policy,\u201d the senators wrote.\n\nThe index invests in Chinese companies that build equipment for the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), have been repeatedly sanctioned by the United States for proliferating dangerous weapons and assist Chinese government repression in places such as Xinjiang, where more than 1 million Uighur Muslims have been interned in camps.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of these companies, Hikvision, was just this week added with seven other firms to the Commerce Department\u2019s list of banned entities. The reason: It produces the surveillance cameras used in the Xinjiang camps. When Hikvision was sanctioned, its stock took a hit, understandably. If millions of federal workers were invested in this fund, their 401(k) accounts would take a hit, as well.\n\nIn addition to the added risk for investors, it doesn\u2019t make policy sense to sanction a Chinese company and then allow the same company to raise money from U.S. capital markets, Shaheen told me.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, if this change goes into effect, national security professionals who work daily to sanction companies that threaten the U.S. will likely invest their retirement savings in some of those very same companies,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a letter to the senators, the board said it was reviewing their concerns and would decide later this month whether to move forward with the plan. But even if the board changes course, millions of other American investors are still passively investing in illicit Chinese companies. Nearly $14 trillion in U.S. investment funds follow the MSCI indexes or use them as a yardstick.\n\nThe typical response from Wall Street types is that Washington China hawks can\u2019t be allowed to politicize investment decisions. But that argument misses the point; the risk is there because Beijing insists on weaponizing its economic leverage. Americans are becoming increasingly vulnerable, whether we point it out or not.\n\n\u201cIt would be ludicrous to claim that taking steps to avoid investing in Chinese concentration camps, sanctions violators, proliferators, PLA weapons manufacturers and other corporate abusers constitutes \u2018politicizing\u2019 our capital markets,\u201d stated Roger Robinson, chief executive of RWR Advisory Group, a Washington-based risk consultancy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe NBA is finding out the hard way that its financial exposure in China is a huge risk to its bottom line. American investors must make sure they don\u2019t find themselves, like the NBA, in a position in which the Chinese government forces them to choose between their pocketbooks and their values.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Investing in China poses risks that U.S. managers haven\u2019t been taking into account.", "authors": ["Josh Rogin", "Columnist Covering Foreign Policy", "National Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-X2vY31pdXcNdFj1oGEgKseAfgQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TPISDVHLU4I6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
