(Photo: Walmart/Yahoo Lifestyle) More\n\nThis is quite possibly the best TV deal we\u2019ve seen: The Sceptre 32-inch HD LED TV is on sale for just $85\u201453 percent off at Walmart.\n\nUsually going for $180, it features super-sharp images and shockingly bright colors. The TV comes with two HDMI ports for a Chromecast or Roku device, and features a QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) tuner built-in \u2014 making it possible to pick up over-the-air channels without a digital antenna.\n\nAt 32 inches, it\u2019s ideal for a bedroom or guest room. Some people, like the reviewer below, even use it as a computer monitor that can be mounted on a wall, which is great for clearing up desk space.\n\n\u201cThe picture quality is excellent and the HD is perfect as a computer monitor,\u201d says a five-star Walmart reviewer. \u201cIt can be mounted pretty much anywhere with an adjustable low-cost bracket, as it is much lighter than expected. I will finally have access to my desk. Overall, the quality is good. It also comes with a truckload of connection ports that will fit any setup. I don't think there is anything in a 32-inch unit that would be a better value for the price.\u201d\n\nWith 4,300+ reviews, this TV has a 4.6 out of 5-star rating. (Photo: Walmart/Yahoo Lifestyle) More\n\nMaybe you can use it in an RV, like this reviewer: \u201cWe bought this TV to replace a 32-inch Jansen in our RV. The picture and features are outstanding for the price. It has plenty of volume to hear over generator and air conditioner noise. After a little bit of use, I'll purchase another for home. So far, it\u2019s great!\u201d\n\nSome Walmart reviewers have even purchased more than one: \u201cI love these televisions, omg! They are perfect. I have four of them. I bought one about two years ago and it is still going strong. I bought two more and realized that I could use it as a computer monitor so I bought another one. I love the picture and sound. This is indeed a great buy.\u201d\n\nShop it: Sceptre 32-inch Class HD LED TV, $85 (was $180), walmart.com\n\nThe reviews quoted above reflect the most recent versions at the time of publication.\n\nRead More from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
