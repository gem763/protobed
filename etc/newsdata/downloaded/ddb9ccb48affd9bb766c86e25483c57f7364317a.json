That is a saving of nearly 20% compared to other retailers \u2013 even if that discount is closer to R500 than the R1,300 Checkers claims.\n\nOn beer, on the other hand, the Xtra Savings are not all the much extra. Checkers is offering what it describes as a R45 saving on 24 bottles of Heineken, available for R235 for those who swipe the new card. For the next week Makro, which also uses a membership card, is running the same case of beer on promotion for R239, or a little under 2% more.\n\nAnd on some items there is no sign of the discount Checkers claims at all, such as a two-pack of Twinsaver roller towel, which appears under a \"save up to 35%\" banner in a Checkers insert \u2013 yet is available for the exact same R24.99 at Pick n Pay.\n\nXtra Savings ran as a pilot project in some Western Cape stores in 2016. It was phased out in favour of what Checkers at the time said was a \"more convenient\" way of offering savings to customers, by having them enter their cellphone numbers at till points.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "If you are buying beer, the launch-offer Xtra Savings aren't all that extra \u2013 but for a Weber kettle braai the discount is genuine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9359/731447d29a084442ae556c87cd09844f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
