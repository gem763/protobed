Having fun with others and playing made-up games might seem silly, but that tomfoolery is vital to developing our self-confidence and social skills.\n\nIn The Power of Play, a documentary from The Nature of Things, we learn that play is just as important in the animal world \u2014 for youngsters and adults. Here are some examples.\n\nHorses\n\nHorses start playing just hours after being born. Exaggerated galloping, chasing, play fighting, and tossing objects like sticks and buckets are some of their favourite games. As you can see in the video below, it brings a whole new meaning to horseplay.\n\nOctopuses\n\nOctopuses are very smart, and many are capable of solving puzzles and performing complicated tasks like opening jars for a snack! But these boneless brainiacs also like to let loose and have fun. Researchers have observed captive octopuses playing with objects by pushing, pulling and floating them to the surface repeatedly. Other octopuses have been spotted blowing streams of water in a pushing game with empty bottles.\n\nIn The Power of Play, we watch how octopuses also enjoy playing games with other species \u2014 like us!\n\nElephants\n\nElephants play throughout their lifetime, in a variety of ways: with objects, with each other, on their own and even with other species. Males like to wrestle and shove, while females are more likely to play the \u201cenemies\u201d game, thrashing through vegetation, whirling and trumpeting \u2014 but they\u2019re also up for a game of soccer when they get the chance!\n\nSheep\n\nLambs love to frolic. Bouncing and leaping are popular activities, especially among females. Other types of play may include rough-and-tumble pushing and butting, and a peculiar game of balancing on their mother\u2019s backs. Sometimes, they\u2019re even keen to take up human sports.\n\nBonobos\n\nBonobos are our closest animal relatives, and they probably play a lot more than we do! The fun and games aren\u2019t just limited to young bonobos, either \u2014 it\u2019s also important for adults. By playing with each other, bonobos create strong social bonds and better understand the emotions of their friends and family, meaning the chasing, play fighting and acrobatics that make up bonobo play is serious business, too.\n\nMORE:\n\nRisky play for children: Why we should let kids go outside and then get out of the way\n\nUnstructured play can create mentally healthier kids\n\nHippopotamuses\n\nKnown to be aggressive and territorial, the imposing hippopotamus also has a lighter side. Young hippos engage in play fighting, games of tag, and hide and seek in their watery homes. As this video shows, they also don\u2019t mind trying to play with their other toothy neighbours.\n\nRavens\n\nRavens are one of the few bird species that are known to play. They like games of chase and tug of war. Play fighting and aerial acrobatics, like flying upside down, are some of their other favourite ways to play.\n\nWatch The Power of Play on The Nature of Things.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/content/images/episodes/Elephant_play_1920.jpg"}
