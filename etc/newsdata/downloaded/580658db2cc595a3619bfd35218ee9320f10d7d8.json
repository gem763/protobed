Bernie Sanders' controversial statement that \"there should be no billionaires.\"\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: 'BILLIONAIRES SHOULD NOT EXIST'\n\n\"Well, Mark, that\u2019s easy for you to say, since you are worth an estimated $70 billion dollars and since \u2013 despite the best efforts of people like Bernie Sanders \u2013 we are not yet a socialist nation and you know that money won\u2019t be confiscated from you,\" Lahren said in her Fox Nation daily commentary, \"Final Thoughts.\"\n\nZuckerberg was speaking during a recent livestreamed question-and-answer session with Facebook employees when he made the surprising assertion.\n\nAsked to respond to Sanders' declaration that billionaires should not exist, Zuckerberg \u2013 the fifth richest person in the world \u2013 offered his unexpected take.\n\nZUCKERBERG SIDES WITH BERNIE SANDERS ON BILLIONAIRES\n\n\u201cI understand where he\u2019s coming from,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have but on some level, no one deserves to have that much money.\u201d\n\nLahren went after the billionaire, slamming him for his \"hypocritical\" support of Sanders and his call to prevent Americans from attaining \"billionaire\" status.\n\n\"Looks like slamming capitalism, while benefiting from capitalism, is quite lucrative ... I\u2019m sure it is easy for you to sit in one of your 10 properties and ponder whether you deserve it...while basking in it all,\" she said.\n\nFACEBOOK CEO THREATENS LAWSUIT AGAINST ELIZABETH WARREN\n\nLater in the segment, Lahren applauded Zuckerberg's plan to donate 99 percent of his Facebook shares to charity, specifically the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative \u2013 which uses technology to solve challenges like eradicating disease and reforming the criminal justice system \u2013 but noted that his decision to do so represented the very premise on which capitalism was founded on.\n\n\"That\u2019s fantastic,\" said Lahren, \"but in a way, this only makes my point. Zuckerberg was able to achieve and attain his billions by working hard \u2013 harder than most \u2013 taking chances, building a company and a mega-brand via innovation and capitalist principles,\" she said.\n\nFACEBOOK CEO MEETS WITH TRUMP, KEY SENATORS\n\n\"Think Facebook could have been founded in Cuba or Venezuela? Think again,\" she continued, referring to countries ruled largely by socialism.\n\nLater in the segment, Lahren doubled down on her praise of the current capitalist structure in the U.S. and warned against redistribution of wealth.\n\n\"Zuck chooses to donate huge sums of his money the way he sees fit \u2014 not by government dictate or mandate. Would he prefer to pledge that estimated $67 billion in Facebook stock to the U.S. government? Send it to the swamp so the bureaucrats could divvy it up the way they see fit? I don\u2019t think so,\" the Fox Nation host said.\n\nBARR ASKS FACEBOOK CEO TO STOP END-TO-END ENCRYPTION PROGRAMS\n\n\"Whether Zuck wants to admit it or not,\" she continued, \"he knows taxation, confiscation and over-regulation kill innovation. He also believes he knows how to spend his money better than the almighty government. He lives his life like a compassionate capitalist and still feels like he must bow down to wannabe socialists like Bernie Sanders. Ridiculous,\" said Lahren.\n\nThe Fox Nation host reiterated her point, expressing support for hard work and unlimited financial potential \u2014 and urged liberals to \"butt out.\"\n\n\"I am sick of these liberals telling us what we deserve and don't deserve,\" she concluded. \"This is America, we deserve what we work hard to earn ... butt out.\"\n\nTo see Lahren's full remarks and for more episodes of Tomi Lahren's daily commentary offering a refreshing and unfiltered perspective on issues across the country, join Fox Nation and watch \"Final Thoughts\" today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
