REUTERS/Dinuka Liyanawatte\n\nRajapaksa is widely seen as the election frontrunner because of his popularity among majority Sinhala Buddhists over his role in ending a 26-year civil war in 2009, ushering in a decade of relative peace until Easter Day bombings that killed 250 people.\n\n\u201cA person who is not a citizen of Sri Lanka is not qualified to be elected to the office of the president,\u201d two rights activists said in the petition filed on Friday.\n\nThey argue that Rajapaksa did not properly obtain dual Sri Lankan citizenship in 2005, when he was a United States citizen.\n\n\u201cThe purported dual citizenship certificate is null and void,\u201d they added.\n\nRajapaksa, 70, renounced Sri Lankan citizenship in 2003 to obtain U.S. nationality, but returned to Sri Lanka two years later, applying for dual citizenship after his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa won the presidency.\n\nSri Lanka does not allow dual citizens or non-citizens to contest national elections.\n\nA spokesman for Rajapaksa, Keheliya Rambukwella, denied the contention.\n\n\u201cNot only are the allegations completely false, this is to create uncertainty and create panic among the general public about Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s candidature,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nNamed by the main opposition Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party as its presidential candidate last month, Rajapaksa also faces uncertainty over a legal battle regarding misappropriation of funds.\n\nStill, Rajapaksa\u2019s popularity has grown in recent months, especially after it emerged that the government had failed to act on repeated intelligence warnings from India ahead of the blasts, which were claimed by militant group Islamic State.\n\nMost Buddhist leaders, and some victims of the terror attacks, have since expressed their desire for the Rajapaksa family to return to power.\n\nThe activists who filed the petition, Gamini Viyangoda, an official of a citizens\u2019 group and Chandraguptha Thenuwara, an artist and lecturer, have campaigned for democracy, good governance and rule of law.\n\nIn the 2015 presidential election, they backed the winner, Maithripala Sirisena, against Mahinda Rajapaksa.", "description": "A court in Sri Lanka set up a three-judge panel on Monday to hear a petition challenging the citizenship of presidential nominee Gotabaya Rajapaksa, which could disqualify the hardline former defence chief from the Nov. 16 vote if it succeeds.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435654751&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T1FQ", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
