These people are lucky the tank didn\u2019t explode, or that the dancing hose didn\u2019t whip around at a bystander. Someone could have been hurt.\n\nOr, worse, they would have all been stained crimson from head to toe and I would have had to make a pitiful joke about how \u201cthe Greens really are Reds after all.\u201d\n\nI suppose the protesters\u2019 metaphor still works, though, no? The Treasury was supposed to be \u201cblood-stained\u201d because of the government\u2019s climate policies; instead, \u201cblood is running in the streets\u201d because of them.
