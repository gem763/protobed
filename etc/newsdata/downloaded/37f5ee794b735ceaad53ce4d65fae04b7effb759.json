At Paris fashion week the conceptual American designer Thom Browne answered the question no one had thought to ask with four pairs of vertiginous \u201cpedestal shoes\u201d in the shape of a leaping dolphin, stabilised by glossy black waves.\n\nModels required assistance to lower themselves into the surreal creations, and stood motionless throughout the show, granting new meaning to the expression \u201cfootlocker\u201d. The fashion publication WWD reported that the heels were so \u201charrowing\u201d one model had to extricate herself from them before the show finished.\n\nShoes so extreme they rob their wearers of mobility (and dignity) fitted the show\u2019s pre-French Revolution theme. High heels reigned, particularly for men, in the Rococo era. But the Sun King probably would not have approved of Browne\u2019s pairs \u2013 at the time, heels were a statement of social standing and the king had the highest pair in the room.\n\n'Ridiculous' micro handbag that can fit only a few mints becomes fashion sensation Read more\n\nAt Browne\u2019s spring 2020 menswear presentation, models were also motionless in their kicks \u2013 though those resembled beach balls rather than marine wildlife.\n\nLike the garden of white flowers, seersucker-covered pannier skirts and wire beehive headdresses covered in red, white and blue bows, Browne\u2019s shoes are purely for show. But that doesn\u2019t mean dolphins won\u2019t have a flipper in Browne\u2019s retail collection. They appeared as appliques on relatively wearable seersucker jackets \u2013 and a small sports bag also assumed dolphin form.\n\nThis follows Browne\u2019s $3,970 dog-shaped \u201cHector\u201d bag, part of a menagerie of animal handbags that also includes an $1,800 Loewe elephant and Judith Leiber\u2019s enduring crystal bird clutches ($4,000 and up).\n\nWhether you view these fauna flourishes as madness or a joyful element of fashion\u2019s fantasy, no model should have to fill out a worker\u2019s compensation claim stating \u201cankle injury due to fall from dolphin shoes\u201d.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
