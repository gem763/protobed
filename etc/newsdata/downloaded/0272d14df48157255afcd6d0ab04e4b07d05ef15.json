USA TODAY\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. \u2014 Now that\u2019s a quality win.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers trounced the Cleveland Browns, 31-3, on Monday night to remain the NFC\u2019s only unbeaten team and just maybe silence the questions about whether their perfect record (4-0) is legitimate.\n\nThey dominated Cleveland from the start, rushing for a season-high 275 yards, dominating on defense to throttle Baker Mayfield, forcing five turnovers and pretty much hosting a festival that sent a signal to the rest of the NFL.\n\nSure, the Browns aren\u2019t the New England Patriots (5-0), the NFL\u2019s only other undefeated team. Yet Cleveland (2-3) is a talented group that on paper appeared to be the most formidable foe the 49ers have faced this season after registering wins at Tampa Bay, at Cincinnati and against Pittsburgh.\n\nMaybe we should re-think that and recast the Week 1 victory against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers \u2014 who blew past the reigning L.A. Rams in Week 4 \u2014 as quality enough.\n\nIn any event, there was no dispute about the 49ers heft before a raucous crowd at Levi\u2019s Stadium.\n\nNext question: Are they legitimate enough to win the NFC West? They can address that on Sunday, when they meet the Rams at the L.A. Coliseum.\n\nNOW THAT'S FAST: 49ers RB hits top max speed in past 2 seasons\n\nPOPPING THE QUESTION: 49ers lineman proposes to girlfriend before game\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER: Sign up now to get football news conveniently delivered to your inbox\n\nRichard Sherman encourages the crowd before a play during Monday night's win over the Browns.

The 49ers rode the second-ranked rushing attack into the ground, so to speak, gashing the Browns for 275 yards on the ground as part of a 446-yard offensive output. The omen came on San Francisco\u2019s first offensive snap when Matt Breida ripped off an 83-yard touchdown run. Breida finished with 114 yards, while Tevin Coleman ran for 97. They threatened to become the first pair of 49ers to run for 100 yards in the same game since Frank Gore (158) and Colin Kaepernick (151) against the San Diego Chargers on Dec. 20, 2014.\n\n\u2666 That\u2019s what the worst game of Baker Mayfield\u2019s NFL career looks like. The Browns quarterback committed four turnovers \u2014 two interceptions and two fumbles \u2014 that summed up his night before the bright lights. Not good. In fact, Mayfield\u2019s 13.4. pass efficiency rating was the lowest in a game of his career. The previous low-water mark (52.6) came against the Chargers last season in Week 6. He completed just 8 of 22 passes for 100 yards with the 2 INTs on Monday night.\n\n\u2666 Antonio Callaway has a lot of rust. It was a season debut to forget for the Browns receiver, who was back after serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL\u2019s substance abuse policy. The worst moment came when it was still a ballgame in the second quarter and Callaway muffed a throw near the goal line that popped into the arms of K\u2019Waun Williams for a momentum-killing interception. This, after he flashed \u201calligator arms\u201d on a pass to the end zone on a previous drive and was flagged for pass interference. He was also the intended receiver on Mayfield\u2019s first pick, but that was on the quarterback as the pass sailed high.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
