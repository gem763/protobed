Late last year rumours began to circulate about my appearance at that event, many of which are simply untrue. While my intention was to honour a musical hero, I recognise my appearance was offensive and I made a terrible mistake.\n\nBen dressed up as a member of Run DMC (Picture: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018As a consequence of this, I readily agreed to disciplinary actions by my employer last year. Since then however, allegations surrounding the party have continued to be made against me. Moreover, they have been used against a wonderful company and the label I love. I have therefore come to the conclusion that I should make this statement and step down, with immediate effect.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continued: \u2018I am devastated that this mistake has caused upset and has called into question my commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion, values which I have championed throughout my career. I have learned a great deal from this event and will resolutely continue to champion these values moving forward.\n\n\u2018It has been an incredible privilege to have worked with the immensely talented artists, managers and team at Atlantic and the wider Warner family.\n\n\u2018I unreservedly apologise to anyone who has been hurt.\u2019\n\nBen gave Ed his first record deal (Picture: Luigi Rizzo/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nWarner Music, Atlantic\u2019s parent company, added in their own statement: \u2018Ben Cook is leaving Atlantic UK and this will be his last week in the office.\u2019\n\nCook joined Atlantic Records in 2007 as managing director of the Asylum imprint, after a successful stint at Ministry of Sound.\n\nHowever, in 2014, he was promoted to President after his huge success with Ed Sheeran.\n\nCook, along with Ed Howard, offered the songwriter a record deal in 2011 after noticing that his No. 5 Collaborations Project EP had reached number two in the iTunes charts as an independent release.\n\nEd went on to achieve two of the biggest albums of the decade with 2014\u2019s X and 2017\u2019s Divide, and under Cook\u2019s tenure, Atlantic\u2019s share of the album UK market grew to 7.9%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCook was also responsible for signing Stormzy to the label last year in a joint venture agreement with Merky, and worked with Anne-Marie and Rudimental.\n\nThe record label also looks after huge stars including Cardi B, Bruno Mars, Clean Bandit, Janelle Monae, Jess Glynne, Rita Ora and Panic! At The Disco.\n\nParlophone\u2019s co-president Mark Mitchell will act as President on an interim basis.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
