You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nLike the reaction to Berkeley city council\u2019s decision to rename \u201cmanholes\u201d as \u201cmaintenance holes\u201d, gendered images and language are divisive topics.\n\nThe evidence, however, suggests that the language and images we use in everyday life shape the way we think about who belongs in a particular social setting. And, more importantly, who doesn\u2019t.\n\nCamra explained its decision as a ban on \u201cdiscriminatory beers\u201d. The intention was to open beer drinking up to women who would otherwise feel alienated by sexist advertising.\n\nThere is nothing inherently male about beer, and no reason why women shouldn\u2019t drink it. So diversifying beer culture seems like good business sense for brewers.\n\nWomen make up only 17 per cent of beer drinkers in the UK so there is clearly an untapped market here. According to research conducted by YouGov for Dea Latis, a group of women brewers, advertising is the single largest barrier to more women drinking beer. So, from this perspective, banning sexist marketing seems like a good idea.\n\nIndustry-wide inequality\n\nWhile banning sexist beer names and pump clips might help to change the culture of drinking, more needs to be done to achieve gender equality in the brewing industry itself. There have certainly been moves to open up brewing to greater diversity. The Pink Boots Society has promoted women in brewing since the mid-2000s, and the FemAle beer festival has been celebrating women in brewing since 2014.\n\nDespite this, academic research suggests that significant cultural barriers to women participating in brewing remain. Research that Scott Taylor, Neil Sutherland and I conducted in the craft brewing industry, with women from the US, the UK and Sweden, found several persistent barriers to women getting into and progressing in the beer business.\n\nSexual harassment is an issue in a range of industries and brewing is no exception. Ranging from inappropriate touching to unsolicited sexual advances and objectifying comments, several of the women we interviewed reported sexual harassment at work. The regular consumption of alcohol as a part of everyday working life made harassment even more likely.\n\nFor anyone in marketing and sales, spending time in bars and pubs is a crucial part of the job, so dealing with men under the influence is a part of everyday work. Many find that their working life regularly overlaps with other people\u2019s social lives \u2013 and a \u201cprofessional context\u201d is far from guaranteed.\n\nThe hours involved in the brewing industry also create another barrier for women, who still shoulder most responsibility for unpaid domestic work and childcare. Unpredictable or anti-social working hours are more likely to impact on women\u2019s careers than men\u2019s.\n\nThe material process of brewing means that it doesn\u2019t always fit well into a standard nine-to-five working day. Depending on the type of beer being brewed, or the nature of the ingredients, getting the beer from raw material into the fermentation vessels, can stretch the working day from 5am to nearly midnight, as one brewer told us. Another explained: \u201cThe raw materials are in charge \u2026 I thought I was going to be home at a certain time, and I wasn\u2019t. We had to stick it out and babysit our beer and make sure that it was OK.\u201d\n\nAs many breweries, especially in the growing craft beer scene, are small, brewers have to see a process through from start to finish. This can clash with the responsibilities placed on women outside of work. As pay in the industry is relatively low, outsourcing these domestic responsibilities is not always an option.\n\nInadvertent sexism\n\nThe design of brewing equipment also creates barriers. As women are, on average, a different shape and size than men, the design of equipment can create additional challenges for women in the industry, a point that sociologist Cynthia Cockburn made back in the 1980s. Several of the brewers we spoke to discussed the physical demands of brewing, and recurrent back injuries. Of course, these affect men too, but have a disproportionate impact on women, as equipment is designed with men\u2019s bodies in mind.\n\nBrewers must master all aspects of the process and men can inadvertently exclude women from career progress by trying to help them. As one brewer told us, when she started out she faced \u201ca huge hurdle of getting over everybody\u2019s instinctual chivalry, which wasn\u2019t allowing me to do my job. There was never a problem about it, but I would go: \u2018Okay, I\u2019ll lift that,\u2019 and they\u2019d be like: \u2018No, are you sure? I\u2019ll lift it.\u2019 And I\u2019d be like: \u2018yes, I\u2019m really sure.\u2019\u201d Overcoming this inadvertent sexism was another barrier for women wanting to get on in the industry because they had to constantly prove themselves in a way that men didn\u2019t.\n\nThese kinds of everyday discrimination continue to create barriers to women working in brewing and suggest that genuine diversity in the beer business will require more than a change of pump-clips and advertising. Despite this, our research did suggest that changes in the industry, and particularly the rise of craft brewing, has created new opportunities for women.\n\nAs the craft beer scene is focused on innovation, experimentation and aesthetic taste, women can position themselves as disruptors in the industry, challenging the \u201cmale, pale and stale\u201d image that has fenced real ale off as a masculine space. By bringing new styles of beer, and new methods of production, women can claim a place in a business that has been dominated by men for the last 400 years.\n\nChris Land is a Professor of Work and Organisation, Anglia Ruskin University.
