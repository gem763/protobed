Of those appeals, over 10,000 have come from just one company: Arrowhead Engineered Products Inc. of Blaine, Minn.\n\nArrowhead imports thousands of aftermarket repair parts for cars, lawn mowers, all-terrain vehicles and other items from China, which are now all being taxed with a 25% tariff that is set to jump to 30% on Oct. 15.\n\nThe duties have undermined Arrowhead\u2019s business model of selling cheaper alternatives to manufacturers\u2019 parts, company officials say. Appealing the levies has proved a challenge in itself, illustrating the trade war\u2019s sometimes hidden toll on U.S. companies.\n\n\u201cWe basically put everything else on the back burner\u201d to appeal the tariffs, said John Mosunic, Arrowhead\u2019s chief operating officer.\n\nSeeing no viable alternatives to the many parts it imports from China, Arrowhead contacted the office of its local congressman, Rep. Tom Emmer (R., Minn.), to see if there was any way to streamline the appeals process.\n\nThe guidance Arrowhead received: Be as specific as you can in seeking exemptions, Mr. Mosunic said. So Arrowhead, which employs about 1,000 people, ended up filing appeals for each gasket, air filter, spark plug and other parts it imports, hiring a crew of temp workers to submit the requests manually.\n\nAn Arrowhead employee unpacks products shipped from China.

Others have filed single applications that cover many products, especially if those items all fall under the same 10-digit code in the tariff schedule.\n\nTrade attorneys and experts say it isn\u2019t clear which tack is more effective.\n\n\u201cIf I had figured out the secret recipe that explains approvals, I\u2019d be speaking from the beach,\u201d said Ted Murphy, a partner in the international trade practice at Sidley Austin LLP.\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has said it would evaluate appeals individually, weighing factors such as whether a product is only available from China and whether duties would harm the company significantly.\n\nTrade experts say navigating the process is especially tough on smaller companies with limited resources.\n\n\u201cSmall businesses wouldn\u2019t have that kind of money to hire one of the well-connected firms,\u201d said Clark Packard, the trade policy counsel at the free market think tank R Street Institute and a former Republican policy adviser. \u201cFor an administration that claims to be \u2018draining the swamp,\u2019 it\u2019s certainly been a bonanza for trade lawyers and lobbyists.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal analyzed filings posted on a website maintained by the USTR. Several hundred new filings have been added each day in recent weeks; the analysis covers filings posted through Friday.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly said tariffs are being paid by China, but in fact they are shouldered by U.S. importers. In filing after filing, companies said the higher costs threatened their survival and that they had no alternatives to the Chinese products.\n\n\u201cIt is not economically feasible for this irrigation-grade component to be manufactured in the U.S.,\u201d XCAD USA, an Idaho-based maker of sprinklers and other irrigation components, said in its filing.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Have the import tariffs affected a company you work for or own, or another business you\u2019re familiar with? Join the conversation below.\n\nBecky Oja, the company\u2019s controller and the lone employee filing requests, said she started building a spreadsheet in June to track information the government required, including confidential sales data. Employees helped her prep by weighing, measuring and describing how each component works.\n\n\u201cWe only have 15 employees\u2014we\u2019re very small potatoes over here in Idaho,\u201d Ms. Oja said. \u201cEvery little fitting and tube for the plumbing of [a product] has to be input into the exclusion request.\u201d\n\nAmerican Scientific, which supplies science products for educational purposes, has submitted more than 100 requests for items including beakers and prisms of various sizes and two colors of litmus paper that it says it can\u2019t find outside China.\n\nThe company said the tariffs could force schools to cut back. \u201cThe school-system budgets are remaining the same and will have to buy 25% less equipment in an environment where education materials are already scarce and [the] level of education is suffering,\u201d the company said in a filing.\n\nLawyers and consultants that some companies have hired to manage the complexities of the process say their clients are overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking clients through the stages of grief,\u201d said Mr. Murphy of Sidley Austin LLP, which helps companies navigate the new trade rules. \u201cThey\u2019re in denial; they\u2019re angry. Eventually you get to acceptance that this is U.S. trade policy.\u201d\n\nArrowhead\u2019s warehouse contains thousands of gaskets, air filters, spark plugs and other parts.

Mr. Hoge says he doesn\u2019t know why some were accepted and others weren\u2019t.\n\nThe USTR, in its decision letter on the denied products, said \u201cthe request failed to show that the imposition of additional duties on the particular product would cause severe economic harm to you or other U.S. interests.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the USTR granted exemptions for more than 400 additional items, primarily applications that had been filed on earlier tranches of tariffs. The decisions included 10 product exclusions requested by Apple Inc. for items such as its Magic Mouse 2 and internal PC components.\n\nAbout 540 companies have submitted just one request for exclusion from the $200 billion list, according to the Journal\u2019s analysis. More than 93% of the companies have submitted 10 requests or fewer.\n\nArrowhead\u2014under its former name, Arrowhead Electrical Products\u2014filed 474 exclusion requests under the tariffs imposed on $34 billion of Chinese goods in July 2018. About 35% of those requests were granted, according to USTR data.\n\nIts current requests for more than 10,000 exemptions are for items on a list of roughly $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that were first targeted with tariffs in September 2018, at a rate of 10%. Mr. Trump raised those levies to 25% in May, and they are set to go to 30% on Oct. 15.\n\nTo work as repair parts, Arrowhead\u2019s imports are carefully specified, making it difficult for the firm to switch suppliers, though it has been looking wherever it can, Mr. Mosunic said.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea with aftermarket parts is to find a lower-cost source,\u201d said Mr. Mosunic. \u201cAnd for a lot of these components there\u2019s no U.S. source, period,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it anymore\u2014it\u2019s gone. Alternators, starters haven\u2019t been manufactured in the U.S. for 20 years.\u201d\n\nWrite to Josh Zumbrun at Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.com", "description": "President Trump has said China is paying the cost of tariffs, but many U.S. importers see them as threats and are racing to seek exemptions.
