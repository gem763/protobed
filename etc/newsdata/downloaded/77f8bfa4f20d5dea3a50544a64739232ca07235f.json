The first step isn\u2019t to buy expensive software, but to look at the devices themselves.\n\nThe settings sections of common household Apple and Amazon devices, along with those that run Google\u2019s Android and Chromebook software, allow parents to do everything from block explicit content to set a fixed gadget bedtime\u2014all without paying extra or ceding privacy to an outside service.\n\nThis week, with the expected rollout of Apple\u2019s iOS 13, parents will more easily be able to set time limits on individual iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch apps. Later this fall, Apple will launch its most compelling upgrade: the ability to manage children\u2019s contacts and control who they can communicate with.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What tips do you have for managing your kids\u2019 digital activity? What are your biggest kid-monitoring headaches? Join the conversation below.\n\nGoogle recently extended its Family Link parental controls to teens and made it a part of the latest Android operating system, and Amazon continues to develop the voice assistant in the Echo Dot Kids Edition, which has the same parental controls as its kids\u2019 Fire tablets.\n\nBefore you go too crazy turning on controls, proceed with a megabit of caution. Family media experts advise parents to begin with more stringent controls when children first get internet-connected devices, then relax them as kids demonstrate maturity.\n\n\u201cWe call them digital on-ramps. When your child is really young, talk to them about everything they do with a device. When you snap a photo, talk about whether you\u2019re sharing it with Grandma, so it becomes embedded in their everyday practice of using devices,\u201d said Diana Graber, author of \u201cRaising Humans in a Digital World: Helping Kids Build a Healthy Relationship with Technology.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s much harder, she said, to impose controls once kids have tasted freedom.\n\nResearchers at the University of Central Florida last year found that too much parental control fosters distrust and encourages kids to do the very things digital controls were designed to prevent.\n\nWhat these settings won\u2019t do is tell you what your kids are seeing or posting online. That is where third-party services like Bark, which charge fees to monitor kids\u2019 online activities, come into play.\n\nAlso, remember that tech companies tend to treat teens as adults, because of a decades-old online privacy law, so managing their activities becomes harder. And of course, teens are notorious for finding workarounds to even the most sophisticated parental controls. Just as previous generations got around curfew by sneaking out of basement windows late at night, today\u2019s digital natives can venture out online by disabling settings, creating fake social media accounts and smuggling burner phones.\n\nStill, it\u2019s best to take a catalog of the devices in your kids\u2019 lives, and know the basic parental-control settings for all of them.\n\nApple: iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch\n\nEven though Apple Inc. AAPL 0.53% introduced parental controls for the iPhone back in 2008, its big leap into this space came last year with iOS 12. With the introduction of Screen Time, parents can track their kids\u2019 device usage, set time limits for categories of apps, such as games or social networking, and schedule downtime for their kids\u2019 devices.\n\nApple's new iOS 13, expected to launch this week, has a feature that allows people to tap \u2018one more minute\u2019 when a Screen Time limit is met, giving them a chance to finish playing a game or scrolling social media. Photo: Apple Inc.\n\nStarting Thursday with iOS 13, parents will be able to more easily create time limits for specific apps within the \u201capp limits\u201d section of Screen Time. Parents previously had to search for specific apps in their child\u2019s usage report, which went back only seven days. And now, they also will be able to track usage data for a month instead of a week.\n\nApple said it would update Screen Time further later this fall, giving parents control over who their children can text, call and FaceTime\u2014and who can communicate with them\u2014by managing their kids\u2019 contacts. Kids won\u2019t be able to bypass the controls by entering phone numbers manually. And parents will be able to get in touch with their kids, even when their devices are otherwise locked down.\n\nHaving no control over who kids can communicate with is a common complaint among parents, according to Christine Elgersma, senior editor of parent education at Common Sense Media.\n\nAnother complaint? Children whining when the game they are playing suddenly shuts down because they have reached a preset time limit. The new iOS has a feature that allows kids to tap \u201cone more minute\u201d when the Screen Time limit is met, giving them a chance to finish what they were doing.\n\nGoogle: Chromebooks and Android phones and tablets\n\nAlphabet Inc. GOOG -0.67% \u2019s Google has an app called Family Link, designed to allow parents to create and manage Google accounts for children under 13.\n\nIt allows parents to set screen-time limits, approve app downloads and set a bedtime for their devices. Parents also can see apps that are recommended by teachers.\n\nSo what happens if a teenager has a normal Gmail account, instead of one created under Family Link? Parents can still use the Family Link app to manage that teen\u2019s account. Just follow the steps to add a child with an existing Google account.\n\nFamily Link will now be accessible from the settings of every device running Android 10, which was released earlier this month, initially on Google\u2019s Pixel phones. Here\u2019s the rub: Teens must agree to allow parental supervision and can turn it off, though Google will alert parents if they do.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Family Link app lets parents set screen-time limits and a bedtime for kids\u2019 Chromebooks as well as devices that run Android.

AMZN -1.71% offers multiple controls under its no-charge FreeTime app. The FreeTime app is included on all Fire tablets, since many kids also use their parents\u2019 tablets. (Parents can upgrade the app by paying a monthly fee to get FreeTime Unlimited, which provides subscribers with e-books, audiobooks and other curated content.)\n\nBeyond the usual bedtime, screen-time and app limits, FreeTime allows parents to create up to four children\u2019s profiles per tablet and to customize age filters so that each child sees only corresponding age-appropriate content.\n\nAmazon allows parents to track how much time their children spend on apps and set goals for educational content. Photo: Amazon\n\nParents can set daily goals for educational content, blocking access to entertainment apps until after the day\u2019s educational goals are met. They also can set different time limits for different activities, allowing more time, say, for reading than for games. And they can disable the web browser.\n\nFor kids using the Echo Dot Kids Edition, parents can create the same controls as they can in the tablets, as well as filter songs with explicit lyrics.\n\nEven with all of these handy built-in settings, family media experts and tech executives alike say that nothing replaces the lessons parents can teach kids about safe and responsible internet usage.\n\n\u201cNo matter how good the product is, it\u2019s super important that parents talk to their kids,\u201d said Kurt Beidler, director of Kids and Family at Amazon. \u201cNo product is the magic pill.\u201d\n\nWrite to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com", "description": "The settings sections of many common devices allow parents to do everything from block explicit content to set a fixed gadget bedtime\u2014all without paying extra or ceding privacy to an outside service.", "authors": ["Julie Jargon", "Julie.Jargon Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107484/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
