Joseph Votel expressed disappointment on Tuesday with the Trump administration's decision to stand down as Turkey prepares to launch military operations in northeast Syria.\n\nThe Trump administration's said Sunday that it would move a small contingent of US troops away from Syria's border with Turkey.\n\nVotel, who oversaw the US's fight against ISIS before his retirement earlier this year, described the decision as an \"abrupt policy\" that appeared to \"abandon our Kurdish partners,\" in a candid column in The Atlantic coauthored with Middle East Institute non-resident fellow Elizabeth Dent.\n\nSeveral US lawmakers and allies also described it as an abrupt move that would all but assure the deaths of Kurdish partners who led the fight against ISIS. In addition to assistance fighting ISIS, the presence of US troops at the border has been viewed as a deterrent to potential Turkish incursions in the region.\n\nUS Marines fire 120 mm mortars at an undisclosed location in Syria in support of Operation Inherent Resolve, September 2018.

Trump has frequently claimed ISIS has been unequivocally defeated.\n\nBut the \"sudden policy change this week breaks that trust at the most crucial juncture and leaves our partners with very limited options,\" Votel added.\n\nSenior US military officials denied the characterization of the announcement as abrupt and said they were consulted in the days before the move.\n\nA senior US State Department official also said that it did not \"support\" Turkey's looming operation \"in any way, shape or form,\" according to The Washington Post.\n\nPresident Donald Trump presents the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy to the US Military Academy football team at the White House, May 1, 2018.
