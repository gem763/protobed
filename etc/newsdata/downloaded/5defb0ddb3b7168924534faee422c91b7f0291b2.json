She said Taipei will closely monitor further developments.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s ambassador in Tuvalu, Marc Su, said that Beijing had little influence there after an unsuccessful attempt to draw Tuvalu away just over a decade ago.\n\n\u201cYou can feel they are trying to attract our diplomatic allies in every possible way,\u201d Su told Reuters by telephone from the Tuvalu capital of Funafuti.\n\n\u201cThis country is OK - there won\u2019t be any effect,\u201d Su said, adding that Taiwan had good relationships in Tuvalu from \u201cgrass roots to top level\u201d.\n\nIn Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang declined direct comment on Tuvalu.\n\n\u201cWe are willing to develop friendly cooperative relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the \u2018one China\u2019 principle,\u201d Geng told a daily news briefing, referring to Beijing\u2019s principle that Taiwan and China are both part of \u201cone China\u201d.\n\nTaiwan will contribute $7.06 million to Tuvalu\u2019s budget in 2019, according to budget documents.\n\nAlong with aid, the nation of around 12,000 people is heavily reliant on income derived from the sale of fishing licences to foreign trawlers and revenue generated from its fortunate country code domain name, \u201c.tv\u201d.\n\nThe domain name attracts interest from many media companies and websites around the world which pay for the rights to use it.", "description": "Parliament in the tiny South Pacific country of Tuvalu elected a new prime minister on Thursday, making a change that analysts say could give China a chance to further undermine Taiwan in a region that has been a pillar of support.", "authors": ["Colin Packham", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
