Police enquiries were made and the friend voluntarily attended for a police interview.\n\n\"She denied all involvement and said she had no boyfriend and that she didn\u2019t loan the car to anyone. She denied all involvement with regards to that motor vehicle.\n\n\"This defendant was rearrested in October and fully admitted her guilt.\n\n\"She told officers that her half-sister had full comprehensive insurance to drive and she did not.\n\n\"She said there were [civil] court proceedings going... and she wanted to ensure she could attend court.\n\n\"No one has been arrested with regards to the theft.\"\n\nIn mitigation defence lawyer Michael Johnson said: ''She had been at a party and the car was taken to the party by someone else who was in attendance.\n\n\"It was the sort of party that had gone on all night and she was going to the shop to buy cigarettes or alcohol.\n\n\"She was given the keys and allowed to take the car and that is when she was stopped by police.''\n\nSentencing, Judge John Potter told Butler: \"I am not going to send you to custody. You have no previous convictions or cautions of any kind and yet here you stand in a criminal dock in a crown court for a serious offence.\n\n\"You gave a false name to police when asked having been found driving a car stolen a number of weeks before.\n\n\"You maintained that pretence then when you were discovered and rearrested you decided to tell the police the truth.\n\n\"You had been at a party for a number of hours and somebody at that party said you could drive that motor vehicle and so, sometime before 10am you did.\n\n\"You came to the attention of police and you were stopped.\n\n\"You gave the name of your half sister because you knew she had car insurance when you did not.\n\n\"That vehicle had been stolen and I accept that you had no involvement in that.\n\n\"You were interviewed and you maintained that pretence and provided police with a prepared statement of a pack of lies.\n\n\"That friend that you said you borrowed the car from was interviewed but she had no involvement with this car so you were rearrested and when interviewed made clear to police what the truth was.\n\n\"You had been concerned about whether you would be remanded in custody which would impact your attending court.\n\n\"That\u2019s the reason why you lied to police - an exceptionally stupid thing for you to have done.\n\n\"All you have done is made your situation worse. Lying does make things worse particularly to police. It was a foolish and stupid decision.\n\n\"You\u2019ve now ended up listening to these words standing in a criminal dock in a crown court facing a possible prison sentence.\n\n\"That is what happens when people tell lies to the police. Serious lies which result in suspicion going elsewhere.\n\n\"Thankfully, for you no one else was arrested and kept in custody as a result of those lies. Had they been then you would be going to prison.''", "description": "Jenna Butler, 24, knowingly gave a false name to officers and has admitted perverting the course of justice", "authors": ["Cameron Sinclair", "Todd Fitzgerald", "Image", "Jenna Butler", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20539152.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jenna-Butler.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
