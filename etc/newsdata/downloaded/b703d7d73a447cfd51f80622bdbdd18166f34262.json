It would be hard to launch a new connect scheme under the current economic situation,\" said Insurance Authority chairman Moses Cheng Mo-chi on Monday.\n\nCheng revealed in June last year that the authority has been in talks with its mainland counterparts to establish a special channel for the marketing, sale and processing of insurance products, using a model pioneered in the stock connect schemes that now link the stock markets of Shanghai and Shenzhen with Hong Kong. A bond connect scheme was added in 2017.\n\nMoses Cheng Mo-chi, chairman of the Insurance Authority, said: 'It would be hard to launch a new connect scheme under the current economic situation.'

The trade war has dragged China's economic growth down to 6.2 per cent in the second quarter, its weakest pace in at least 27 years.\n\nThe unprecedented anti-government protests in Hong Kong, which started peacefully on June 9 in opposition to a now withdrawn extradition bill, have turned increasingly violent and led to a sharp fall in tourist numbers.\n\nSome insurers believe sales to mainlanders have dropped by more than 20 per cent year on year over the last two months. At present, mainlanders must come to Hong Kong in person to buy the policies.\n\n\"Just like any other retail business, the insurance sales to the mainlanders are affected by the decline of tourists,\" Cheng said. \"We would need to wait until everything has calmed down and the economic situation has improved to study the new connect scheme.\"", "description": "A proposed new \"insurance connect\" scheme to allow cross-border sales of insurance products between Hong Kong and mainland China is on hold because of economic uncertainties arising from the trade war and the unprecedented social unrest that has rocked Hong Kong for the last three months.\"", "authors": ["Enoch Yiuenoch.Yiu Scmp.Com"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bUH0PfgOrMPiCGH4umm9Wg--~B/aD01NDg7dz05NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_us_228/326d1c2e766689b9e336a435c472010d", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
