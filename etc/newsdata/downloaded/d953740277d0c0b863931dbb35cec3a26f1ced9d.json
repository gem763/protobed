By contrast it has allowed a hatful of them, in a 35-3 World Cup loss to England and a 92-7 thumping by defending champion New Zealand in a pre-tournament warmup.\n\nKefu is hopeful that Telusa Veainu\u2019s return from a foot injury to play at fullback changes the dynamic.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have many players like Telusa. He is high quality and has a lot of X-factor,\u201d Kefu said of the Leicester Tigers player. \u201cHe is critical for us. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve thrown him straight in.\u201d\n\nTongan territorial gains counted for little against England, but Veainu could change that.\n\n\u201cI think we were very poor in attack. We didn\u2019t execute or throw any punches,\u201d said Kefu, a former backrower who won the 1999 World Cup with Australia. \u201cI think he will give us spark in attack, he can make something out of nothing.\u201d\n\nVeainu\u2019s selection somewhat softens the blow of losing flyhalf Kurt Morath to a throat injury which has ruled him out of the tournament.\n\nJames Faiva has the considerable task of replacing Tonga\u2019s World Cup and all-time leading scorer, in what will only be his sixth test appearance.\n\n\u201cJames\u2019 strength is his kicking game and that fits in very well with how we want to play. We want to play territory and keep the ball in front of the forwards,\u201d Kefu said. \u201cBut he is also going to have to tackle and communicate well.\u201d\n\nTo help Faiva cope with the defensive demands against a Pumas team which offloads well and has quick backs, Kefu has switched veteran center Siale Piutau from outside to inside center.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I play for Bristol. Obviously it\u2019s a different challenge here, but I will be closer to helping James,\u201d said the 33-year-old Piutau, who is making his 10th World Cup appearance. \u201cIt will be another physical battle. The scrum and lineout is also our strength and if we can match them (there), I think we will have a good platform.\u201d\n\nArgentina has twice finished the Rugby World Cup in third place, in 2015 and 2007.\n\nA defeat would all but end its chances of reaching the knockout stage, however, seeing as Argentina lost its opener against France.\n\nWales was the last team to fail to reach the knockout rounds in the tournament after playing in the semifinals - exiting at the group stage in 1991 after finishing third in 1987.\n\nTonga needs to win to keep its own slim chances alive in a hard Pool C, where it still has to play three-time runner-up France.\n\nAlthough Argentina is favored to win at Hanazono Rugby Stadium, on the outskirts of Osaka, the Tongans believe in a similar upset to Uruguay\u2019s 30-27 upset win over Fiji on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe have seen there is a chance,\u201d Piutau said. \u201cOnce the stars are aligned, there\u2019s a wonderful opportunity for us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tonga has been conceding heavily without scoring much lately, and the attack has to start firing against Argentina in Saturday's must-win Rugby World Cup match.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/japan_rugby_wcup_england_tonga_33169_c0-137-3276-2047_s1770x1032.jpg?6e89093f527f5783cf2159908538a30478650986", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
