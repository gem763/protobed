And seeing what Khabib did to Dustin Poirier in the fashion that he did it in, it motivated me a little bit more to go back down.\u201d\n\nHaving struggled in the past with his weight cuts down to lightweight, Lee admitted he was pressured to make the move up to 170.\n\n\u201cIt was something that was kind of in the back of my mind, especially after my last fight \u2013 and if I\u2019m being honest, maybe a little bit before, too,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI started my career at 155. There was a lot of pressure for me to move up to 170, and I kind of gave into that a little bit. But to be honest, my heart of hearts has always been at 155.\u201d\n\nLee has been criticized for continuously seeking the Nurmagomedov fight, but no one can argue that he doesn\u2019t aim for the toughest challenges. Despite losing three of his past four fights, the goal remains the same.\n\nHe wants to challenge Nurmagomedov for the title one day.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big factor in me going back down, is that fight with Khabib,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s been on my mind for years now. I like a big challenge \u2013 like, the biggest challenge possible. I\u2019m not Superman. It\u2019s not even saying I\u2019m going to go out there and defeat the world. But the biggest challenge, that\u2019s the one that kind of gets me up. That\u2019s what separates me from a lot of these dudes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Motown Phenom\u201d got an opportunity to taste gold when he faced Tony Ferguson for the interim lightweight title at UFC 216 in 2017, but ultimately fell short and was submitted in the third round. After a strong start, Lee started to tire, and the staph infection he suffered prior to the fight started to take a toll on his body.\n\nThat\u2019s a fight he\u2019d like to run back, too.\n\n\u201cGoing out there and getting the chance to compete with somebody like Khabib or Tony Ferguson, for that matter (is what I want),\u201d Lee said. \u201cIf Tony beats Khabib, that\u2019s a fight that I really want to get back, too. It\u2019s one that a lot of people want to see me go 100 percent healthy in and me, too, just for my own competitive drive.\u201d\n\nWith Nurmagomedov (28-0 MMA, 12-0 UFC) putting on one dominant display after the other, most recently submitting Dustin Poirier at UFC 242, people are having a hard time trying to solve his puzzle. His grappling has proven to be too dominant for his opponents to handle, and he\u2019s been able to control his fights with relative ease.\n\nThe theory many have, including Ferguson\u2019s jiu-jitsu coach Eddie Bravo, is that people are too defensive minded when they face \u201cThe Eagle.\u201d\n\nLee partially agrees with that, and says he\u2019s one of the fighters who can take it to Nurmagomedov in the grappling department.\n\n\u201cIt could be that,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re going against somebody and you don\u2019t have that wrestling background that he has, it could be that guys are just afraid to engage in the wrestling. I think it\u2019s going to take somebody who\u2019s not afraid, and that\u2019s me.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to be somebody who\u2019s unafraid to engage in the wrestling. I\u2019ll even go offensive. Nobody has even threatened to take Khabib down, so once you factor all that in, it changes the whole game.\u201d", "description": "Kevin Lee wants a fight with lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov and thinks he has the grappling ability to take the fight to him.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "George Garcia"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/kevin-lee-edson-barboza-ufc-fight-night-128-4.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
