Now they will also be able to buy cars that contribute to a climate-neutral future - vehicles such as the XC90 T8, for instance.\n\n\"I believe that this will sit well with South Africans, who are becoming increasingly aware of the need to reduce the carbon footprint of their cars,\" he added.\n\nTo realise the 40% reduction of its CO2 footprint per car by 2025, the company has devised a number of ambitions for different parts of its operations.\n\n'A climate-neutral future'\n\nIts previously communicated goal of generating 50% of global sales from fully electric cars by 2025 is a prominent one, which would result in a 50% reduction in carbon emissions between 2018 and 2025.\n\n\"We are transforming our company through concrete actions, not symbolic pledges. So at Volvo Cars, we will address what we control, which is both our operations and the tailpipe emissions of our cars,\" said H\u00e5kan Samuelsson, chief executive.\n\n\"And we will address what we can influence, by calling on our suppliers and the energy sector to join us in aiming for a climate-neutral future,\" he added.\n\nAnother one of the brand's ambitions is to include a 25% reduction of CO2 emissions related to its global supply chain by 2025, a 25% share of recycled plastics in new Volvo cars by 2025 and a 25% reduction of carbon emissions generated by the company\u2019s overall operations, including manufacturing and logistics.\n\nAn electrified future\n\nVolvo was the first conventional car maker to commit to all-out electrification and phasing out cars powered only by an internal combustion engine.\n\nAs of this year, every new car launched will be electrified while also launching its first fully electric car, the XC40 Recharge. Starting with the XC40 Recharge, the brand will disclose the average lifecycle carbon footprint of each new model.\n\nThe XC40 Recharge is the first car in Volvo Cars\u2019 new Recharge car line. Recharge will be the overarching name for all chargeable Volvos with a fully electric and plug-in hybrid powertrain.\n\nThe Recharge car line aims to further boost sales of Volvo Cars\u2019 electrified cars and encourage plug-in hybrid drivers via incentives to use Pure mode as much as possible.\n\nCompiled by: Robin Classen", "description": "Volvo Cars is aiming to radically reduce its lifecycle carbon footprint per car by 40% as part of an ongoing ambitious climate plan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2762/5e321504944643ca85bab70e165034b4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
