In the quarterfinals, he put on a two-round clinic in earning a unanimous decision over Alexandre Almeida. Palmer outstruck his foe 94-2 as he earned across-the-board scores of 20-18 for the victory.\n\nIn the semis, the former WSOF champion had a tough out in plucky Alex Gilpin. Gilpin, who handed Andre Harrison his first career stoppage loss with a second-round submission in the quarters, pushed the pace in the first half of the fight. Palmer rallied in the fight\u2019s second half, and seeming concerned how the scores may go, he really poured it on from top position in the final round.\n\nTurned out he needn\u2019t have worried, as the judges saw it 30-27 across the board, although the fight was more competitive than that score sounds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome to be back in the finals again,\u201d said Palmer, who has won 10 straight fights. \u201cI went against a great opponent in Alex Gilpin, I fought him twice this season and he\u2019s one of the toughest guys I\u2019ve fought this season. Nothing but respect for him.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll take on the surprise of the PFL postseason thus far in Pineda (28-13), a seventh-seeded competitor making his PFL debut who finished both of his foes in the first round. Pineda TKO\u2019d Movlid Khaybulaev in just 29 seconds in the quarterfinals, then used a guillotine choke to stop Jeremy Kennedy in an even four minutes to punch is ticket to New York.\n\n\u201cNobody showed me no respect,\u201d said Pineda, who has all 28 of his career victories by way of a finish. \u201cThey said I was done in the first fight. I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nSchulte takes two submissions to reach finals, Radzhabov grinds his way there\n\nWhile Palmer put in a hard 25 minutes to get to the finals, Brazil\u2019s Schulte (19-3-1) needed less than nine minutes combined to earn his return to the championship round.\n\nSchulte\u2019s quarterfinal bout with Ramsey Nijem was as frantic a 52-second fight as you\u2019ll ever see. Nijem, whose weight cut Thursday was so harsh he had to cut his hair to lose his final ounces and hit his mark, got his foe into a tight choke. But Schule escaped and soon thereafter trapped Nijem in a rear-naked choke for the victory.\n\nIn the finals, he met Aliev, who earned a unanimous decision over Rashid Magomedov in the quarterfinals. Aliev gave Schulte plenty of trouble, particularly in the clinch, and he outstruck Schutle 68-25 over the course of the fight.\n\nBut in the second, Schulte made a smooth transition from a successful hiptoss to side control to a sweet arm-triangle form mount, and Aliev went out rather than tap out, giving Schulte his ninth career submission win and second of the evening.\n\n\u201cBelieve in your dreams, trust in God\u2019s plan for you,\u201d Schulte said through an interpreter. \u201cHe knows everything. I feel so blessed right now.\u201d\n\nFight Twice, Win Twice, put your opponent to sleep twice, in the Same Night! @NatanSchulte's quest for back-to-back belts is alive and well! #PFLPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/vvZ1dJhOFG \u2014 #PFLPlayoffs (@ProFightLeague) October 18, 2019\n\nSchulte will meet Loik Radzhabov, who grinded his way to a pair of grueling victories, in the Dec. 31 finals. In the quarters, Radzhabov\u2019s fight with Islam Mamodev was as even as two rounds can possibly be. The judges scored a 20-18 for Radzhabov and a pair of 19-19s. For the tiebreaker, the judges declare an overall winner PRIDE-style, and Radzhabov got the nod from all three judges.\n\nFor the semifinal bout with Chris Wade, the duo had the shortest rest period of any of the semfinals and it fast turned into a battle of attrition. Wade had his moments, but Radzhabov simply had more in the tank, outgrappling Wade and outstriking him 104-45.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to go for the million, I represent my nation, I represent my roots, and I\u2019m going to go get it,\u201d Radzhabov said through an interpreter.\n\nFull results:\n\nLoik Radzhabov def. Chris Wade via unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27) \u2014 lightweight semifinal\n\nNatan Schulte def. Akhmed Aliev via technical submission (arm-triangle choke) \u2014 Round 2, 2:26, lightweight semifinal\n\nDaniel Pineda def.
