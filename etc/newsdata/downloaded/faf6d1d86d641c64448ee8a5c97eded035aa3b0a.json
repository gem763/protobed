As in Morrowind, the stars you were born under govern every aspect of your life. And now you can apply those celestial insights to that most dignified form of Russian roulette: stock picking!\n\nBull and Moon is an app from the professional pranksters behind MSCHF \u2014 yes, it\u2019s stylized like a mid-aughts synth band, and yes, it does say \u201cmischief,\u201d and yes, it really is a creative agency \u2014 and it\u2019s their latest effort to Zardulu the good, unsuspecting people of the world.\n\nThe app takes design cues from Co\u2014Star and The Pattern; it\u2019s blue and gold, with the cool minimalist lines that denote au courant taste. It\u2019s very simple to use: after you download Bull and Moon, all you do is input your first name, your date of birth, and your investing experience, and the app will give you personalized stocks.\n\nThat simplicity feels like it\u2019s hiding a lot of data. It doesn\u2019t show your chart, or when the companies were founded; it also doesn\u2019t seem to take into account the time of your birth, which devotees view as an important part of an accurate astrological chart. What is visible, though, is a historical breakdown of a company\u2019s stock price.\n\n\u201cBoss makes a dollar, I make a dime, that\u2019s why I shit on company time\u201d\n\nBull and Moon isn\u2019t the first foray MSCHF has had into making, hm, mischief online. Previous \u201cdrops\u201d (their term) have included Jesus Shoes (Nike Air Maxes with holy water from the River Jordan in the soles); The Word of the Day Is (a Slack game where you could win real money that was eventually banned by Slack); Netflix Hangouts (which allow you to watch Netflix at work by making it look like you\u2019re on a call); and Times Newer Roman (a font that looks like Times New Roman but is 5-10 percent bigger).\n\nEach project feels like a playful take on modernity\u2019s increasingly alienating trends; there\u2019s nothing like seeing the astrology boom, for example, taken to its logical endpoint, which is to say being captured entirely by capitalism. Jesus Shoes are hypebeast culture incarnate \u2014 there\u2019s nothing more #rare than walking on water. Making Netflix look like work is just the newest evolution of \u201cboss makes a dollar, I make a dime, that\u2019s why I shit on company time.\u201d\n\nThese pranks are clever bits of culture-jamming, poking fun at the weird trends that seem to arise every other week. The best part about MSCHF, though, is their regularity: each drop is scheduled in advance, and they\u2019ve been planned out every 2nd and 4th Tuesday through September 28, 2021. So get ready for the next one.", "description": "The app takes design cues form from Co\u2014Star and The Pattern; it\u2019s blue and gold, with the cool minimalist lines that denote au courant taste.
