He protested their resale, and urged the company to at least include an expiration or \u201cbest by\u201d date, or a date of manufacture, on the packaging.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed Tuesday by Siddharth Breja, a former senior vice president of global finance who worked at the San Francisco-based company from May 2018 to March 2019. In the lawsuit \u2014 filed in US District Court for the Northern District of California on the same day that Juul confirmed its plans to lay off about 500 people \u2014 Breja claims he was retaliated against for raising concerns about the contaminated shipment.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A former Juul executive is alleging in a lawsuit that the fast-growing startup shipped out one million contaminated e-cigarette pods earlier this year \u2014 but did not tell customers or issue a recall.\n\nDo you work for Juul or have you worked for Juul?

Crosthwaite in September, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cMr. Breja became aware of very concerning actions at the company, and he performed his duty to shareholders and to the board by reporting these issues internally,\u201d Harmeet Dhillon, an attorney for Breja, told BuzzFeed News when reached for comment. \u201cIn exchange for doing that, he was inappropriately terminated. This is very concerning, particularly since some of the issues he raised concerned matters of public safety.\u201d\n\nA Juul spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nJuul is fighting off a firestorm from government agencies, public health advocates, and clinicians, who blame the e-cigarette giant for addicting millions of teens to nicotine. A nationwide lung injury outbreak, now standing at 1,604 cases and 34 deaths, is being investigated by public health agencies, which have primarily linked the illnesses to vaping black-market THC. But the connection to nicotine-containing devices, such as Juul, has not been fully ruled out, either.\n\nBreja alleges that on March 12, 2019, in an executive team meeting, he learned that some batches of mint e-liquid had been found to be contaminated. Approximately 250,000 mint refill kits, the equivalent of one million pods, were manufactured with the contaminated e-liquid, shipped to retailers, and sold to customers.\n\nBreja was concerned about the public\u2019s safety, the lawsuit alleges, especially in the wake of consumers recently having reported seizures after Juuling.\n\nAnd he was asked to charge the supplier of the e-liquid, Alternative Ingredients, Inc., for $7 million for the contaminated batches. (That company did not immediately return a request for comment.) Breja was concerned by \u201cthis hypocritical approach of not informing the customers about the contamination on one hand (claiming it was not a serious issue) and charging the supplier for it on the other hand,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nThat same day, Breja \u201cprotested Juul\u2019s refusal to issue a product recall for the contaminated pods, or at a minimum issue a public health and safety notice to consumers.\u201d Then-chief finance officer Tim Danaher reportedly \u201cquestioned his financial acumen,\u201d since these suggestions would lead to billions of dollars in lost sales and hurt Juul\u2019s then-$38 billion valuation, according to the lawsuit.\n\nDanaher, whose departure was announced by the company on Tuesday, allegedly told Breja that he should remember his loyalty to Juul. (Danaher did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Breja was terminated on March 21, just over a week after he raised concerns about the contaminated pods. He was told it was because he had misrepresented himself as the chief financial officer at Uber. Breja says that he never made that claim, but had accurately stated that he was the chief financial officer of a division of Uber. Juul\u2019s claim is \u201cpreposterous\u201d and \u201cintentionally invented\u201d to hurt Breja\u2019s reputation and employment prospects, the lawsuit alleges.", "description": "\u201cHalf our customers are drunk and vaping like mo-fos, who the fuck is going to notice the quality of our pods,\u201d the former CEO allegedly said.", "authors": ["Stephanie M.
