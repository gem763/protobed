Image: JAXA\n\nThe goal of bombing Ryugu was to create an artificial crater that Hayabusa2 will later sample for scientists on Earth to analyze. Ryugu is a rather old and primordial asteroid, and the samples are expected to help \u201cclarify the origin of life\u201d in the universe, among other insights, according to JAXA.\n\nJapan originally launched Hayabusa2 in 2014 with a handful of \u201cbouncing\u201d rovers and enough firepower to make John Wick blush. In addition to the Small Carry-on Impactor that the probe just deployed to Ryugu\u2019s surface, Hayabusa2 was packing a five-gram tantalum bullet that it fired into the surface of the asteroid in early March.\n\nSo, not only has Hayabusa2 bombed an asteroid, it\u2019s shot one too. That\u2019s not a space probe you want to mess with.\n\nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.", "description": "Hayabusa2 was launched with a five-gram bullet and an explosive, both meant for the Ryugu asteroid 200 million miles from Earth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5ca7693d25495a00078fc020/lede/1554476210305-jaxa.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.9221311475409836xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-04-05"}
