Rams owner Stan Kroenke is doing with Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park, the extravagant attempt to create a West Coast shrine for the NFL that is under construction here.\n\nThere\u2019s a big cost to building a state-of-the-art football stadium these days, and this one dwarfs all others. The new L.A. stadium isn\u2019t just the most expensive in the U.S., and perhaps the world. It\u2019s costing more than double the next priciest NFL stadium, and far more than the industry standard. The estimated cost for the Raiders\u2019 new stadium in Las Vegas, for example, is under $2 billion.\n\nAnd every dollar spent here has gone toward tackling one of the toughest problems in American sports: making professional football work in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cYou have to go back to the history of: How do you solve the NFL in Los Angeles?\u201d said Kevin Demoff, the Rams\u2019 chief operating officer. \u201cIt was always predicated on getting the right location, the right stadium, the right teams and the right development.\u201d\n\nAt this time next year, the first stages of this sprawling project will be complete and two teams will call the new stadium home. Kroenke\u2019s Rams will move in from the Coliseum, while the Chargers will move from their temporary home in a soccer-stadium-turned-football-bandbox.\n\nA recent tour of the stadium and interviews with executives show the broader ambition of the project. Kroenke is spending lavishly to create a building they felt could only exist in Los Angeles, and is already set to host events like the Super Bowl in 2022, the college football championship in 2023 and the Olympics in 2028.\n\nThe complex is far larger than just a stadium, and the approximately $5 billion spent on the stadium may wind up being less than half the total cost. When the plot is fully developed, the total expenditure could exceed $10 billion, people familiar with the matter said. It isn\u2019t just largest sports complex around, it\u2019s one of the largest privately financed projects in the entire country.\n\nThe breadth of the project is captured by the makeshift village that has been constructed to carry out a vision that\u2019s far bigger than a home for some football games. Inside the 298 acres, there will be residences, a hotel, retail space, offices, a lake and more than 20 acres of public park. Temporary structures currently litter the grounds\u2014they had to build a makeshift city in order to build this miniature city.\n\nThe primary hub is actually three separate spaces. There\u2019s the stadium itself, which will seat 70,240 with the potential to expand to more than 100,000 for major events. Nearby, there\u2019s also a 6,000-seat performance venue. In between, there\u2019s a 2.5 acre plaza.\n\nAll three will be covered by a translucent plastic roof, like the one at the Minnesota Vikings\u2019 U.S. Bank Stadium. The roof, which will angle downward from the stadium, over the plaza and to the theater, will be one of the final pieces to go up. Unlike U.S. Bank Stadium, it isn\u2019t closed off by walls. The goal was a distinctly L.A. indoor-outdoor stadium hybrid.\n\nAnd the sight of all of this going up is striking to anybody even vaguely familiar with the NFL\u2019s blundering history here.\n\nAn aerial view of the new L.A. stadium Photo: LA Stadium at Hollywood Park\n\nFrom 1995 through 2015, there wasn\u2019t an NFL team in Los Angeles. The Rams and Raiders both left after the \u201894 season, creating a jarring vacuum. While the country\u2019s richest sports league placed teams in cities like Jacksonville, it didn\u2019t have one in the country\u2019s second most populous city. There was no shortage of proposed sites\u2014in City of Industry, Irwindale, Carson, downtown, even Anaheim\u2014but nothing came of them. People began to question whether professional football was legitimately viable here.\n\nBut there was one spot the league always coveted, and the Rams\u2019 move was approved because of their ability to maneuver for it and their vision there. That location was just a few miles from Los Angeles International Airport, in Inglewood across the street from the Forum. Kroenke, whose background is in real estate, purchased the first 60 acres between the Forum and Hollywood Park in 2014. That land was later merged with the land from the closed racetrack.\n\nIt was a speculation that paid off two years later: the Rams\u2019 proposal was approved in 2016, and the Chargers soon followed as part of the deal. They came up with broad plans for their giant tract of land, and that began with an expensive undertaking: digging 100 feet into the ground.\n\n\u201cIt created challenges just in terms of moving dirt,\u201d said Jason Gannon, the project\u2019s managing director.\n\nThe proximity to LAX had two distinct effects on the stadium\u2019s design. It meant that they obsessed over the optics and not just how the complex would look like from the inside or ground level, but also from up above for the nearly 200,000 passengers who fly in and out of the airport every day. It also meant they had to sink the stadium deep underground to avoid interfering with the nearby air traffic.\n\nA steel canopy wraps L.A. Stadium, the future home of NFL's Rams and Chargers.

The designers say this makes it easier for most fans to enter and exit. It\u2019s possible to be as high as the stadium\u2019s fourth or fifth level, out of eight, before being above ground.\n\nThe experience inside the stadium has a simple premise. Imagine a rooftop bar with some football going on. The concourses on the inside are designed to allow people to move freely throughout, while they enjoy the open air and sightlines into the stadium and the 70,000 square foot video board that\u2019s as long as the field.\n\n\u201cIf you close your eyes and saw the stadium you\u2019d say: It has to be in Los Angeles,\u201d Demoff says. \u201cThis couldn\u2019t be something you\u2019d envision anywhere else.\u201d\n\nA 6,000 seat performing arts venue being built on site at L.A. Stadium. Photo: Nick Agro for The Wall Street Journal\n\nOutside the stadium, there are currently vast and largely empty plots of land. But these are perhaps more important than the stadium itself. The Rams and the NFL knew for this project to make any sort of financial sense, it had to be operational year round and not just on Sundays.\n\nThroughout the design process, that was the parallel path they had to balance. The stadium was only part of the campus. At every step, they had to consider how it would work in tandem with the office buildings, retail space and more that will eventually inhabit the adjoining land.\n\nThey already have at least one notable tenant there: the NFL, which will move NFL Media and the NFL Network headquarters there in 2021.\n\n\u201cThis certainly could have succeeded without a stadium,\u201d Demoff said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the stadium could have succeeded without the project.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts How do you solve the NFL in Los Angeles?
