Royal Dutch Shell Plc and ConocoPhillips have expressed interest in bulking up in shale at the right price. Exxon Mobil Corp.\u2019s chief said Wednesday his company is keeping a \u201cwatchful eye\u201d on the Permian for potential deals.\n\nOil\u2019s drop to near $55 a barrel, from $75 in October, is putting pressure on shale producers at a time when investors are losing faith in an industry that has burned about $200 billion of cash in a decade. Despite record U.S. output, the S&P index of independent exploration and production companies is trading near its troughs of 2008 and 2015, when crude prices sank south of $35 a barrel. The producers are now worth just 4.5 times their earnings before certain items, compared with 9 times about a year ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear there are many E&Ps trading well below the Chevron valuation watermark from April,\u201d said Michael Roomberg, who helps manage $4.4 billion at Miller/Howard Investments Inc. He expects \u201cseveral additional deals over the next several quarters, and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the majors are involved.\u201d\n\nPioneer Natural Resources Co. or Concho Resources Inc., which have both struggled this year, would be a good fit for Exxon, while Shell may look at smaller players like WPX Energy Inc. and Cimarex Energy Co., according to Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.\n\nThe collapse in valuations has been so severe that the biggest shale producers may also come into play. EOG Resources Inc. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. could also be targeted, Ben Cook, a portfolio manager at BP Capital in Dallas, said earlier this year. Activist investor Carl Icahn is pushing for a shakeup of the board at Occidental.\n\nAfter a slow start in shale, Exxon and Chevron have expanded in the Permian at prodigious rates over the past two years and now see onshore exploration in the U.S. as a key part of their global growth plans. They expect to more than double output to roughly 1 million barrels a day each by the early 2020s.\n\nThe two heavyweights are betting their ability to fund enormous drilling programs and build associated infrastructure like pipelines and gas terminals means they won\u2019t encounter the growing pains the independents are currently experiencing.\n\n\u201cIf there is the opportunity to acquire something that brings unique value to Exxon Mobil, we\u2019ll be in a position to transact on that,\u201d Exxon CEO Darren Woods said at a Barclays Plc conference Wednesday.\n\nBut he\u2019s willing to let potential targets struggle for some time to get a better price.\n\n\u201cTime\u2019s on our side to let that play itself out,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI think people need to recalibrate what they\u2019re experiencing in that unconventional space, and that will have an impact on how people value companies.\u201d\n\nChevron will be \u201copportunistic\u201d in making acquisitions, the company\u2019s North America head Jeff Gustavson said at the same conference. Any deal would have to be a strategic fit and be good value, he said.\n\nBP Plc entered the fray a year ago, acquiring BHP Group Ltd.\u2019s onshore oil and gas assets for $10.5 billion. In hindsight, the timing looks bad given the slump in shale valuations since then.\n\nWaiting for too long could be risky as well. On the day Chevron bid for Anadarko (which it ended up losing to Occidental Petroleum Corp.), major shale producers surged as much as 12% as investors bet on a buyout frenzy.\n\nSo far, Exxon, Chevron and Shell are looking smart.\n\nSome shale producers are struggling to pay creditors, with Sanchez Energy Corp. and Halcon Resources Corp. recently filing for bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe majors \u201care going to go out there and run these guys into bankruptcy,\u201d Mark Rossano, CEO of C6 Capital Holdings, said on Bloomberg TV. \u201cThey\u2019re going to look to pick up acreage at significant discounts.\u201d\n\n(Corrects Pioneer\u2019s Permian output in chart titled \u2018Major Rivalry\u2019 in story published Sept. 4)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Kevin Crowley in Houston at kcrowley1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A bloodbath in energy stocks is creating a rich opportunity for Big Oil to dominate America\u2019s hottest shale play.Independent producers in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico are trading much lower than when Chevron Corp. bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp. in April.
