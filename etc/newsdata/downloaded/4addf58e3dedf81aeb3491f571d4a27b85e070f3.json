(For Some of Us, She Never Went Away.)", "language": "en", "text": "Perhaps she can capture the full emotional impact of Ms. Garland\u2019s last chapter the way that the great female impersonators, such as Jim Bailey and Tommy Femia, did fleetingly but brilliantly through songs and a bit of nightclub banter in their careers.\n\nPart of the Judy allure is, of course, her tragic demise: It\u2019s the classic life-cut-short tale so many of us are drawn to, from James Dean to Janis Joplin to Prince. Her unparalleled celebrity also remains intriguing; as with figures such as Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland\u2019s highs and lows \u2014 the booze, the pills, the husbands, the meltdowns on the Hollywood set \u2014 loom large.\n\nBut it\u2019s her raw talent that has kept her in that never-fade-out posthumous spotlight that shines on so few. There\u2019s a good chance we won\u2019t have Ariana Grande impersonators in sophisticated nightclubs in 30 years or YouTube deconstructions for those who think Lady Gaga was robbed of an Oscar for her performance in \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d 65 years from now the way we\u2019re still analyzing Ms. Garland\u2019s loss in the same role to Grace Kelly in 1955. (Groucho Marx reportedly sent Ms. Garland a telegram the next day: \u201cDear Judy, this is the biggest robbery since Brinks.\u201d)\n\nThe internet has also kept the Judy mystique alive in both hilarious and reverent ways. Just witness the Punchy Players online with their splicing of clips of Ms. Garland and her daughter Liza Minnelli from Ms. Garland\u2019s 1960s TV show into a skit about grocery shopping (complete with Ann Miller at the checkout counter). Or the various takes of \u201cThe Man That Got Away\u201d from \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d especially the final cut, which may be the greatest 4 minutes and 38 seconds you\u2019ll spend on this planet. Or consider a 14-minute YouTube retrospective of her career. It\u2019s exhausting to watch what a person can pack into 47 years.\n\nThe saddest part of \u201cJudy\u201d hitting big screens soon is that we know how it will end. We know that Ms. Garland did not fade into old age. She didn\u2019t wave to her fans from a balcony as Doris Day did in her 90s. Nor did she become a staple of \u201970s variety shows like Bob Hope or a fixture on daily talk shows like Zsa Zsa Gabor. Ms. Garland truly burned out \u2014 a victim of the Golden Age of Hollywood that served up so many victims as it churned out the facade of happiness and hope for generations.\n\nBut little Frances Gumm of Grand Rapids, Minn., was transformed into Judy Garland \u2014 in all her brilliance and tragedy \u2014 and the joy she brought to millions is singular, if only through the lens of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d perhaps the most watched and rewatched movie of all time, 80 years later. \u201cJudy\u201d will depict Ms. Garland\u2019s last chapter in all its sad finality, but we\u2019ll have Judy again for a couple of hours. And then we can go home and rely on YouTube and our memories to help get us through, come rain or come shine.\n\nDavid Belcher is an editor and writer with the Opinion section in Hong Kong.", "description": "The new film \u201cJudy\u201d offers another chance to bask in her glory, 50 years after the demise of her fairy tale gone wrong.", "authors": ["David Belcher"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/opinion/27belcher/merlin_144783912_d7ecde46-2fb3-456c-8e0b-1b6e0c354a1f-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
