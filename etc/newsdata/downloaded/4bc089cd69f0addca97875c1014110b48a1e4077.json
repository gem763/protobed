However, the man allegedly behind it, William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, was apparently fair game.\n\n\u201cThe film is not about any of the real families,\u201d Salky told the outlet. \u201cWe looked at all the families involved and we kind of said to ourselves, \u2018What kind of people were part of this? There were people connected to Rick, people who want the kids to go to those kinds of schools, people who had a certain socioeconomic level,\u2019 and we really actually tried to avoid any similarities to anyone specific with regards to the families. But Rick Singer is a real character in our film.\u201d\n\nLORI LOUGHLIN, MOSSIMO GIANNULLI HANDLING COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS: SOURCE\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, the movie, titled \u201cThe College Admissions Scandal,\u201d follows fictional interior designer Caroline and single mother Bethany as they deal with the fallout from paying the real-life scam mastermind to help get their kids admitted to the college of their choice.\n\nSinger, who was arrested in March after being paid by several wealthy parents to facilitate their kids\u2019 admission into elite schools, was one of the only real-life people dramatized for the film. Huffman and Loughlin, the two most high-profile parents swept up in the scandal, aren\u2019t featured. However, their stories are alluded to throughout the film.\n\nLORI LOUGHLIN'S COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL SENTENCE WILL LIKELY BE HARSHER THAN FELICITY HUFFMAN'S: US ATTORNEY\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud earlier this year. She confessed to paying an admissions consultant $15,000 to have a proctor correct her older daughter's answers on the SAT. She considered the same for her younger daughter but decided against it.\n\nIn addition to having to self-report to prison on Oct. 25, she also received one year of probation, was ordered to perform 250 hours of community service and pay a $30,000 fine.\n\nMeanwhile, Loughlin, 55, and her husband were accused of paying $500,000 to Singer to get their daughters Olivia Jade and Isabella recruited onto the University of Southern California's crew team despite neither girl ever being a rower. USC put the girls' enrollment statuses on hold amid an internal investigation into the scandal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe pair rejected the plea deal that other parents allegedly involved in the case \u2013 including Huffman \u2013 accepted. Giannulli, 56, and Loughlin then were hit with additional charges of money laundering and conspiracy and could face up to 40 years behind bars if convicted on all charges.\n\nFox News' Jessica Sager contributed to this report.", "description": "Viewers were surprised on Saturday when Lifetime\u2019s made-for-TV movie about the real-life college admissions scandal didn\u2019t include a single reference to Lori Loughlin or Felicity Huffman.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/lori-loughlin-felicity-huffman-college-scandal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
