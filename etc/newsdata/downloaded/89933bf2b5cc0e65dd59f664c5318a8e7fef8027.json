The movement had a far-reaching impact on how industries \u2013 from the arts to politics and business \u2013 dealt with allegations of abuse.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rosanna Arquette on Weinstein: \u2018There are very very powerful men in our business who feel sorry for him and that he lost his career and continue to behind the scenes figure out a way to support him.\u2019 Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI think [the Weinstein accusations] are the tip of the iceberg in what we are going to see and what will be revealed in the future \u2013 as we\u2019ve just seen from Jeffrey Epstein and his horrible network that\u2019s connected to so many powerful men worldwide,\u201d said Arquette, who has alleged that the Miramax co-founder sexually assaulted her in the early nineties.\n\nPerkins worked for Miramax in the 1990s and signed a non-disclosure agreement after she left the company when a colleague said they were attacked by Weinstein. She also said there were more stories to come about powerful men who have abused their positions.\n\n\u201c[Men like Weinstein] are everywhere and ultimately my call has not been so much about punishing these individuals \u2013 there are always going to be these individuals,\u201d she said. \u201cThe real issue is that society and the system needs to change because currently the systems all work in favour of the powerful.\u201d\n\nThe allegations against Harvey Weinstein \u2013 a list Read more\n\nWeinstein will face criminal trial in January 2020 for charges including rape and predatory sexual assault, all of which he has pleaded not guilty to. More than 80 women have alleged sexual misconduct by the producer over a period of four decades.\n\nBoth Arquette and Perkins said that while the publications of allegations against Weinstein had provoked some change for the better, they had not seen as much progress as they would have hoped for.\n\n\u201cIt has been a profound transformation,\u201d said Arquette. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive worldwide wake-up call to men in particular to change their bad behaviour on a fundamental level.\u201d But she added: \u201cThere are very, very powerful men in our business who feel sorry for him and that he lost his career and continue to behind the scenes figure out a way to support him.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zelda Perkins prior to testifying before British lawmakers investigating workplace sexual harassment in London, March 2018.

When you think about how shocking all the information that we have received \u2013 and are still receiving \u2013 is, unfortunately people have already been slightly inured to it.\n\n\u201cThe trickle-down effect is absolutely there and things are happening but it\u2019s a pendulum. The pendulum swung very, very far in one direction and then a lot of men got very upset and frightened and thought it was all frightfully unfair.\u201d\n\nPerkins said there would inevitably be a period of uncomfortableness. \u201cThere is when there is any big social change and I\u2019m afraid, yes, we probably will lose some fantastically talented people [who have abused their power], but that\u2019s the price that has to be paid to get back to zero and get proper equality.\u201d\n\nAsked why the Weinstein revelations had such a big impact, Arquette said: \u201cWe saw with the women who spoke out about Bill Cosby and Roger Ailes that the backlash can be horrendous. But for some reason, when the women came out against Weinstein the time was aligned with the stars, if you will, and somehow people were really ready and willing to listen in a way they hadn\u2019t been before.\u201d\n\nThe first use of the phrase \u201cMeToo\u201d to raise awareness about the prevalence of sexual assault and abuse against women was by the civil-rights campaigner Tarana Burke in 2006. \u201cThe sad truth is that it wasn\u2019t until white women and particularly famous white women started using the term that it was taken up by the media in such a way,\u201d said Perkins.\n\n\u201cUltimately it doesn\u2019t matter because I hope that the #MeToo movement has spread globally and I hope that all women feel that they own it.\u201d", "description": "Exclusive: Zelda Perkins and Rosanna Arquette predict more revelations about high-profile men to come", "authors": ["Frances Perraudin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d0315c24167a9788c9df9ce226ec4c2dab808c6/679_840_4628_2777/master/4628.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=965602d872008910fd9bb71d88666bcc", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
