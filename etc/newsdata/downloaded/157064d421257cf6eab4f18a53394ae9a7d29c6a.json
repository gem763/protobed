And then there's the glowing, awards-heavy reception for the animated \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\" starring the Miles Morales version of the character.\n\nBut Sony should look to its own history for lessons of hubris: after trusting director Sam Raimi's creative instincts on the first two wildly successful \"Spider-Man\" films, the studio tried to impose its will on the third installment (namely, shoehorning in Venom), resulting in a compromised vision that satisfied neither the filmmakers nor the audience, essentially bringing the franchise's momentum to a dead halt.\n\nRead More", "description": "Sony stands to miss out on the most if the studio and Disney walk away from their landmark pact that allowed for synergistic sharing, but moviegoers, too, stand to lose.", "authors": ["Analysis Scott Huver"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160310171550-02-spider-man-captain-america-civil-war-super-tease.jpg"}
