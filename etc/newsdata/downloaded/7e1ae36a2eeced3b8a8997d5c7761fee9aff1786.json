This trend began in May, when US-China trade tensions escalated and peaked in August.\"\n\nThe CIO also noted that the weak data coming from the US on manufacturing on Tuesday was a \"troubling sign that the downturn in manufacturing could be worse than we have been expecting,\" as recession fears continue to mount.\n\nHe added that due to Brexit and poor manufacturing data from Europe, fiscal stimulus across the continent may not be enough to stimulate markets.", "description": "UBS chief investment officer has a very negative outlook for 2020.\u00a0 Mark Haefele said that he expects 'global growth to slow in 2020 to its slowest p...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d9460916428f700ca2ee817-2400/gettyimages-102441523.jpg"}
