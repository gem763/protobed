Now, the Australian actor doesn't mind the world knowing about his own love life: Hemsworth was photographed out in New York City holding hands with a blonde woman. She has not been identified yet, but TMZ got photos of Hemsworth with her in West Village. The two ate at Sant Ambroeus, wore matching jeans and sunglasses, and went on a walk. The outlet obtained photos of both activities.\n\nHemsworth's apparent date sighting comes shortly after Us Weekly published a report detailing what he thinks of Cyrus publicly dating again so fast. \u201cHe wants what\u2019s best for her\u2014even if it\u2019s not him,\u201d a source told the outlet, adding that Hemsworth is not opposed to dating, either. Although he \u201chasn\u2019t been dating anyone,\u201d the source said, \"he\u2019s open to meeting people.\u201d And clearly he has.\n\nCyrus defended her own decision to date quickly on Twitter last week after a video emerged of her making out with Cody Simpson at an a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl eatery just two weeks after she ended her relationship with Kaitlynn Carter. Cyrus and Carter's romance became public just as she released her statement announcing she and Hemsworth separated. The married couple had reportedly secretly been separated for months.\n\nCyrus pointed out the unfair double standard between men and women in regards to dating behavior: \"I am trying to just THRIVE/survive in a 'man's' world,\" she wrote. \"If we can\u2019t beat 'em, join 'em! If our president can 'grab 'em by the pussy\u2026.' can\u2019t I just have a kiss and a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl?!?!\"\n\nShe also explained that she is just figuring out her love life too, while the world watches. Get used to it, and give her space to: \"This 'dating' thing is new to me too,\" she wrote. \"I\u2019ve never been an 'adult'/ grown ass woman experiencing this,\" she wrote. \"I was in a committed relationship for almost all my teens and early 20s, with the exception of a few breaks, which usually in those times I was working my ass off with not much R&R, and 'meeting / trusting' people in my position is really tuff. Don\u2019t fucking pity me, not what I\u2019m asking for. I have a great life; I wouldn\u2019t trade for 'privacy,' but PLEASE don\u2019t make this awkward for me! I am trying to make light and like always MAKE FUN of myself / and the public\u2019s perception of me! Get used to me dating\u2014this is where I am at! #HotGirlFall\"\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nWatch the latest videos Yahoo UK Lifestyle", "description": "Miley isn't the only one publicly moving on.", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yMPVqvkZCGGY9gH5Bi7bgQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/a7326b531e17225bf70d466594cbe5e3", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
