It's not our fault. It's not our problem. I'm not trying to get to the bathroom and get in someone's business,' Pippen responded.\n\nDefending herself: Larsa Pippen is defending her actions after going on vacation with Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian when a friend noticed a woman crying in the bathroom and Larsa didn't seem to care\n\nNot her business: Larsa said she didn't want to get involved in the woman's life but on her social media says she isn't 'in Turks to counsel anyone I don't know'\n\n'I'm sorry but I'm the caring friend. If I see someone crying, I'll be the first to ask them if they are ok,' a user commented on HollywoodUnlocked's Instagram.\n\n'Right a friend!!! If I knew them I would have. They were arguing all night. Like I'm not in Turks to counsel anyone I don't know. And we were all drinking so who knows how the night could have ended,' Larsa responded back to the comment.\n\nBut when another user commented: 'Why didn't she mind her business with Jordyn? Ran to the Hollywoodunblocked and TMZ. Spotlight seeking groupie,' that's when she got defensive.\n\n'Actually babe, I'm the one who tried to stop the stories by telling my friends what was going down. They also have called me, told me things about my situation and that's what friends do!!! But I'm in another country watching a couple fight all night long like what does that have to do with us? We're drinking, enjoying my friend's bday trip. The house I wanted us to go to was my longtime friend's house.'\n\nGirl's trip: Kourtney and Stephanie were there to listen to Sarah when she spoke about the upset woman, and they revealed they saw her upset too\n\nWhen the episode ended, the influencer took to her Twitter to defend her actions to her fans during the heated discussion.\n\n'I didn't mean to be dismissive to Sarah,' she wrote candidly on her social account.\n\n'I just didn't think we should be getting involved in any type of domestic situation when we're out of the country #KUWTK.'\n\nHaving fun! While on the trip Larsa and Khloe Kardashian donned matching braids while in Turks and Caicos\n\nAnd that's when Khloe pipped in once and for all to dissolve the situation.\n\n'I know that @LarsaPippen is a great friend to Kourt and she has a great heart. Sarah and her are simply different people. But both are good souls #KUWTK.'\n\nBut it seems as though it has all blown over as Kim Kardashian is celebrating her 39th birthday today and her longtime friend was there to give her a shoutout on social media.\n\n'Happy bday boo bear!! I love you so much, we\u2019ve been thru everything together. You\u2019re my Bestie for life. The best is yet to come,' she wrote along with a mirror selfie of the two.", "description": "Larsa Pippen is defending her actions after her most recent trip with Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian in Keeping Up With the Kardashians.
