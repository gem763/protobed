Some analysts saw the Hong Kong offer as a defensive move to scupper the Refinitiv deal and prevent the London exchange becoming a bigger rival like CME and ICE.\n\nHKEX, whose main shareholder is the Hong Kong government, said its proposal represented a 22.9 percent premium to the LSE\u2019s closing stock price on Tuesday.\n\nAfter initially jumping more than 17 percent in reaction to the news, LSE shares were trading 5.4 percent higher at 1205 GMT.\n\n\u201cIt looks uncertain whether shareholders will accept the offer, given that the Refinitiv deal is popular across the shareholder base for its potential to transform the business and add value over the long-term,\u201d said Guy de Blonay, a fund manager at Jupiter, a top-25 investor in the LSE.\n\nThe LSE announced in August that it had agreed to buy Refinitiv in a $27 billion deal aimed at transforming the exchange into a market data and analytics giant.\n\nRefinitiv declined to comment. Its majority shareholder Blackstone (BX.N) had no immediate comment, while minority shareholder Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO) declined to comment. Reuters news agency is a unit of Thomson Reuters.\n\nThe proposed takeover of the LSE comes at a time when Hong Kong is beset by political upheaval. Pro-democracy protesters lit fires and vandalized a metro station near the exchange on Saturday as increasingly violent clashes with police move into their fourth month.\n\n\u201cThis is not helpful. As a financial center, trust and confidence are important,\u201d HKEX boss Charles Li said of the protests last month, when HKEX reported a 21% fall in trading fees in the first half of the year.\n\nHKEX has been the world\u2019s largest listings venue in five of the past 10 years, splitting the crown over that decade with the New York Stock Exchange, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nBut this year it has fallen behind, raising $10.8 billion to the NYSE\u2019s $20.2 billion, with activity suffering as the political turmoil deepened. Last month, Alibaba delayed plans for a $15 billion offering because of the unrest.\n\n(GRAPHIC: LSE shares expensive even before HKEX offer, here)\n\nFor an interactive version of this chart, click here tmsnrt.rs/31gJ7W8\n\nFILE PHOTO: The name of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited is displayed at the entrance in Hong Kong, China January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo\n\nINVESTOR SOUNDS CAUTION\n\nA top-10 shareholder in the LSE, who declined to be named in line with his company\u2019s policy during potential mergers, sounded a cautious note about the prospects of a successful takeover of the exchange.\n\n\u201cHKEX bought LME a few years ago to have a presence in the UK already, but clearly they are trying to diversify away from their Chinese exposure, which is why they are bidding now and not nine months ago,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShareholders won\u2019t be rushed to make a decision as we like the Refinitiv deal,\u201d he added.\n\nFACTBOX-How the LSE and HKEX stack up:\n\nA successful Hong Kong bid for the LSE would sabotage Blackstone\u2019s lucrative deal to sell Refinitiv. It would also scupper plans to refinance some $13.5 billion worth of leveraged loans and bonds which were issued to pay for Refinitiv with investment grade bonds issued by the LSE.\n\nPrices of bonds issued by Refinitiv were only slightly lower in secondary trading on Wednesday, implying continued investor confidence in the company\u2019s tie-up with LSE.\n\nThe approach is the latest international attempt to acquire the LSE - Germany\u2019s Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) has failed three times in recent years, hitting opposition from politicians and regulators.\n\nLSE CEO David Schwimmer has said that big takeovers in exchanges are difficult due to political concerns and in recent years the LSE has sought to diversify away from basic trading and clearing to data and analytics.\n\nThe Asian exchange, however, said it was confident its proposal faced no major regulatory hurdles due to little overlap in markets.\n\nHKEX said it has already begun discussions with certain regulators in Britain and Hong Kong. \u201cThe board of HKEX believes that the two businesses are highly complementary and as such, looks forward to working with the relevant authorities to deliver a clear path to completion,\u201d it added.\n\nShould the proposed takeover be successful, it is expected that key LSE management would continue to operate LSE businesses, HKEX said.\n\nThe Hong Kong government threw its support behind the move.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Signage is seen outside the entrance of the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain.

REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\n\n\u201cThe government is glad to see HKEX\u2019s endeavor to enhance its core strength and seek international expansion in accordance with its strategic plan,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nThe UK Treasury declined to comment on commercial matters.\n\nBusiness Secretary Andrea Leadsom told Bloomberg TV the UK welcomed foreign investment but would \u201clook very carefully at anything that had security implications for the UK\u201d.\n\nHKEX said that under the terms of the deal, LSE shareholders would receive 2,045 pence in cash and 2.495 newly issued HKEX shares. It said it intended to apply for a secondary listing of its shares on the LSE once the deal has gone through.", "description": "Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing <0388.HK> has made an unsolicited $39 billion takeover approach for the London Stock Exchange , a proposal contingent on the LSE ditching its acquisition of data company Refinitiv.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428636079&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0LW", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
