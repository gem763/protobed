They noted gaps in the way both companies screen their drivers. For instance, neither collects fingerprints from drivers as part of their background checks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s woefully inadequate, leaving passengers vulnerable and at risk of harassment or assault,\u201d said Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Oregon, adding that the hearing should serve as a wake-up call to ride-hailing companies that their days of operating with little oversight are over.\n\nThe committee introduced a bill that aims to close some gaps, helping riders confirm that their drivers are legitimate. For instance, the bill would require drivers to have digital QR codes that a rider could scan with a smartphone. It also would prevent anyone but the ride-hailing companies from selling Uber and Lyft signs for drivers to display in their car windows.\n\nThe bill was inspired by college student Sami Josephson who was kidnapped and murdered after getting into a car that she thought was her Uber ride.\n\nLyft said it supports increasing penalties for anyone impersonating a rideshare driver or attempting to sell Lyft signs.\n\n\u201cWe share lawmakers\u2019 commitment to safety,\u201d said Lyft spokeswoman Campbell Matthews in an email.\n\nUber said it has been working closely with the committee since its initial outreach in September and will continue to work with lawmakers and law enforcement to focus on the most effective measures to put safety first.", "description": "Snubbed by Uber and Lyft, a House committee went ahead with its hearing Wednesday on safety and employment issues plaguing ride-hailing companies.
