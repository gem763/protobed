(Spencer Van Dyk/CBC)\n\nThat scenario played out earlier this month at Alexander Galt Regional High School in Lennoxville, in Quebec's Eastern Townships.\n\nA 15-year-old female student was allegedly threatened at knifepoint by a male student.\n\nAngry with the school administration's response to that incident and others, more than 300 students protested outside the school last week, demanding more be done to stop bullying.\n\nSherbrooke police have arrested the teenaged suspect. He's expected to appear in youth court Dec. 5.\n\nCollaboration rather than punishment\n\nCompared to the rest of the country, Quebec students actually report fewer incidents of some kinds of intimidation than other Canadians. They report less name-calling, fewer incidents of homophobic or transphobic comments, fewer incidents of being threatened with violence with a weapon, and fewer incidents of theft.\n\nIn another study released in 2018, Quebec students reported having observed fewer instances of aggressive behaviour than in 2013 and said they feel safer at school.\n\nUniversit\u00e9 Laval Prof. Claire Beaumont is the author of that 2018 study, which is based on interviews with 24,000 Quebec students at 84 schools.\n\nClaire Beaumont, an expert in school violence, said schools need to model respectful, positive ways for students to resolve conflict. (Universit\u00e9 Laval)\n\nStill, Beaumont said, she is not surprised by Mission Research's findings.\n\nAlthough the Quebec government passed a law in 2012 requiring schools to have an action plan to prevent violence and bullying, there are no requirements set out for schools to follow.\n\nSome are following best practices, Beaumont said, but the approach varies greatly from one school to the next.\n\n\"There's still work to do,\" she said.\n\nThrowing money at the issue will not solve the bullying problem, said Beaumont, nor will doling out punishment to those identified as the bullies.\n\n\"If we are kicking students out of school, are we showing them how to behave better?\" she asked.\n\nShe said suspensions can trigger more frustration and violence from the perpetrators.\n\nShe believes schools should focus on modelling healthy, respectful interactions and relationships, as well as constructive ways of resolving conflict \u2014 not just among students, but between teachers and students, too.\n\nShe thinks some teachers need to change their behaviour.\n\n\"There are some who humiliate students, who hand out humiliating punishments, who scream,\" Beaumont pointed out. \"We all need to work in the same direction.\"\n\nFeeling safe starts with 'respectful environment'\n\nRoyal Vale School's principal, Nathalie Lacroix-Maillette, said the school's first responsibility is to make sure all children feel safe.\n\nShe believes that starts with having a respectful environment.\n\nWhen CBC Montreal visited the school this week, the EMSB's violence prevention consultant was giving a teacher workshop on cyberbullying and online exploitation.\n\nThe program, called Kids in the Know, was developed by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection.\n\nFor students, it talks about how to set boundaries, how to develop the self-confidence to speak up in uncomfortable situations and how to resolve issues in a peaceful way.\n\nRoyal Vale School's principal Nathalie Lacroix-Maillette said the school acts quickly to stop bullying once it is reported to administration. (CBC)\n\nLacroix-Maillette couldn't comment on Sendel's case, as there are criminal charges against one of the people who allegedly bullied Sendel.\n\nBut in general, Lacroix-Maillette said, when a bullying incident is reported, the school's administration steps in and tries to resolve it right away.\n\nShe understands it is not easy for parents to see their child unhappy, but she said she's very satisfied with how the school has intervened once bullying is reported.\n\n\"Our mission is certainly not to please parents at all costs,\" she said. \"It's really to make sure that we have respectful relationships and if there's a case of bullying, it stops right away.\"\n\nShe thinks bullying and intimidation at Royal Vale are under control, she said.\n\n\"I am not saying there are no issues \u2014 absolutely not,\" said Lacroix-Maillette. \"No school can actually pretend that there are no issues. Whenever we have social interactions, I think it is pretty tricky.\"\n\nOften, she said some of the worst cases of bullying happen out of sight of teachers and are not reported.\n\nMission Research's survey shows of the more than 4,000 Canadian youth surveyed, 45 per cent said they did not report what happened to them to school officials.\n\n\"In order for us to intervene, we need to be aware,\" said Lacroix-Maillette.\n\n'It's not you'\n\nSendel hopes CBC's survey on school violence serves as a wake-up call for schools and students about the consequences of bullying and the fall-out.\n\nShe said she still suffers from social anxiety because of what happened to her.\n\nNow at CEGEP, she's happy about school for the first time in years.\n\nHer face breaks into a huge smile when she talks about her classes at the small, private college she attends.\n\n\"I'm glad high school is over,\" Sendel said.\n\nWhen asked what she thinks schools need to do better to combat bullying, Sendel believes they need to focus on the mental and emotional well-being of their students as much as on the academics.\n\nShe'd also like to see more resources made available, both to victims and to bullies.\n\nIn her case, she said, some of the people who targeted her were suspended from school, but little changed afterward. She wonders if mediation could have helped get to the root of why they were bullying her in the first place.\n\n\"No one is really born mean: they are taught to be mean,\" said Sendel.\n\nShe wants to remind other students who are being bullied that it gets better.\n\n\"It's not you. You're not the problem.\"\n\nRead other stories in this series:\n\nIf you have feedback or stories you'd like us to pursue as we continue to probe violence in schools in the coming months, please contact us at schoolviolence@cbc.ca.", "description": "More than half of Quebec youth say they've been on the receiving end of hateful comments and name-calling in high school, according to the results of a CBC poll of young Canadians asking about physical and sexual violence in school.", "authors": ["Leah Hendry Is A Tv", "Radio", "Online Journalist With Cbc Montreal Investigates.
