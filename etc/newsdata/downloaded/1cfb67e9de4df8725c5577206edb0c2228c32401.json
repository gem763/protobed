Myers revealed the news at a recent blockchain event Devcon 5, Coindesk reports Oct. 25.\n\nEthereum 2.0 is a major network upgrade on the Ethereum blockchain that is poised to shift its current Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm to Proof-of-Stake, passing block validation function from miners to special network validators. As previously agreed by Ethereum core developers, the first stage of the Ethereum\u2019s transition to Ethereum 2.0 is expected to take place on Jan. 3, 2020.\n\nETH 2.0 Calculator\n\nAt the same event, Myers also revealed a tool allowing validators to calculate annual gross and net returns, taking into account hardware and energy costs. Dubbed ETH 2.0 Calculator, the new web application is planned for launch in conjunction with Ethereum 2.0, Myers noted. The calculator\u2019s model is discussed in Telegram group ETH 2.0 Calculator.\n\nYesterday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed his stance towards the Google\u2019s much-discussed quantum computing progress, which could allegedly impact Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto. In a tweet on Oct. 24, Buterin pointed out that recent quantum supremacy is as far from real quantum computing as hydrogen bombs are to nuclear fusion, explaining them as:", "description": "In order to become a validator on the Ethereum 2.0, one is required to maintain 32 Ether, worth of $5,300 at publishing time", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZWE0MzNmZmY1NDBjNGI5OGU5NWNlYTQ5YWQwYTZjOTYuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
