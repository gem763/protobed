This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes.\"\n\nSpeaking with reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said his conversations with world leaders are \u201calways appropriate, at the highest level always appropriate.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he discussed Biden in this conversation, Trump said: \"It doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed.\"\n\nMore: Joe Biden: Trump suggestion of wrongdoing in Ukraine not credible\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Friday that, in a July phone call, Trump \"repeatedly pressured\" Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Biden's son, who had business interests in the country. The Journal said Trump told Zelensky \"about eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, on a probe, according to people familiar with the matter.\"\n\nAs Democrats look at allegations that Trump and aides sought to pressure Ukraine into helping the president's re-election bid, they are also seeking details of a still-secret complaint by an unnamed intelligence official regarding the president's talks with foreign leaders.\n\n\"We're determined to do everything we can to determine what this urgent concern is,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Cal., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called on the Trump administration to release the complaint to lawmakers. \"We must be sure,\" she said, \"that the President and his Administration are conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President\u2019s personal interest.\"\n\nBiden also called on Trump to release a transcript of the telephone call in question, saying \"such clear-cut corruption damages and diminishes our institutions of government by making them tools of a personal political vendetta.\"\n\nWhile campaigning in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Biden said accusations swirling around Hunter Biden's business interests in Ukraine, are entirely bogus and political.\n\n\"Not one single credible outlet has given credibility to these assertions \u2013 not one single one,\" Biden said. \"So I have no comment other than the president should start to be president.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. and Ukraine governments announced that Trump and Zelensky, will meet with next week at the United Nations.\n\n....statement. Strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2019\n\nTrump's relationship with Zelensky \u2013 including a July 25 phone conversation \u2013 is the subject of a congressional investigation, and perhaps part of the whistleblower complaint as well.\n\nThe Washington Post, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, reported that \"a whistleblower complaint about President Trump made by an intelligence official centers on Ukraine.\"\n\nCongressional Democrats said they don't know what is in the whistleblower complaint because the Trump administration is preventing them from seeing it. Trump administration officials have declined to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nEarlier this month, Schiff and two other Democratic House committee chairs asked the administration for a transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call, and other records related to Ukraine. In a letter to administration attorneys, lawmakers referenced news reports that Trump or his allies are urging Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of Biden's son Hunter.", "description": "House Democrats seek details of a still-secret complaint against Donald Trump filed by a member of the intelligence community.", "authors": ["David Jackson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kqBWKwU7vukR6blkizBe9w--~B/aD0zMjg3O3c9NDkzMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/1ca9912ac852579465275c70d5df4a14", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
