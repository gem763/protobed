To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in,\" Prince Harry said.\n\nBullying\n\n\"There comes a point when the only thing to do is to stand up to this behaviour, because it destroys people and destroys lives,\" he says.\n\n\"Put simply, it is bullying, which scares and silences people. We all know this isn\u2019t acceptable, at any level. We won\u2019t and can\u2019t believe in a world where there is no accountability for this.\"\n\nThe legal action, which is being privately funded by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, claims privacy infringement, infringement of copyright and a \"media agenda\", which \"is part of a campaign by this media group to publish false and deliberately derogatory stories about her, as well as her husband.\n\nEuronews has contacted Associated Newspapers for comment.\n\nWant more news?", "description": "'I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces,' Harry says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/10/92/1000x563_cmsv2_3c466f77-97d9-5b28-9389-6a947046c099-4201092.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
