We all believe in freedom of religion. We\u2019re all proud Americans, everybody has the right to practice their own religion. But we cannot now use the argument that it is my religious belief that if you\u2019re gay, I will not sell you a cake, or I will \u2014 if you are black, it is my religious belief you can\u2019t come into my store, if you\u2019re Jewish, or whatever. We\u2019ve gone way, way beyond that. And it worries me very much that there is a strong movement trying to bring \u2014 under the guise of freedom of religion, racism, and sexism, and homophobia back into this \u2013.\u201d\n\nHe later added, \u201cWe would pass federal legislation that makes it clear, absolutely clear that it is illegal to prohibit \u2014 to have discrimination against anybody because of their sexual orientation. That\u2019s clear, and it would be very broad and sweeping legislation, at work and any other capacity of life.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "During an interview with CNN on Thursday, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) stated that \"we cannot now use the argument | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1172144061-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
