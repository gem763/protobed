REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Sajid Javid said on Monday he planned to deliver the first post-Brexit budget statement on Nov. 6, less than a week after the country\u2019s deadline for leaving the European Union.\n\n\u201cI will be setting out our plan to shape the economy for the future and triggering the start of our infrastructure revolution,\u201d Javid said in a statement.\n\nIn the event of a no-deal Brexit, the government would act quickly to outline its approach and \u201ctake early action to support the economy, businesses and households,\u201d followed by a budget in the following weeks, the government said.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson says he will take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31, with or without a deal. But lawmakers have passed legislation which they say will force him to seek a delay if no transition agreement is struck in time.\n\nJavid, who took office in July, has already announced the biggest increase in day-to-day public spending in 15 years, putting borrowing on course to overshoot a cap set by his predecessor, Philip Hammond.\n\nJavid has suggested he is prepared to borrow more in the future to take advantage of record-low borrowing costs.\n\nBritain has steadily cut its budget deficit from almost 10% of gross domestic product in 2010 to just under 2% now.\n\nBut analysts have warned that Javid could end up weakening Britain\u2019s budget credibility by making big spending pledges at a time when the economy has slowed and the outcome of Brexit remains so unclear.", "description": "British finance minister Sajid Javid said on Monday he planned to deliver the first post-Brexit budget statement on Nov. 6, less than a week after the country's deadline for leaving the European Union.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440614930&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0FH", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
