It was a targeted campaign to pressure a foreign government to interfere with an American election on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf \u2014 apparently by holding hostage nearly $400 million in military aid.\n\nHe and many of his defenders have clung to the idea that there was no \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d a position rebutted on Tuesday by the testimony of William Taylor, the top American diplomat i n Ukraine.\n\nFaced with this jaw-dropping account from the president\u2019s own envoy, the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, dismissed it as part of \u201ca coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday the president went further. He called Mr. Taylor \u201cNever Trumper Diplomat Bill Taylor\u201d in one tweet and declared in another: \u201cThe Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them, they are human scum!\u201d\n\nBut as the evidence piles up, it gets harder to paint this as some groundless conspiracy. So Mr. Trump has resorted to the schoolyard taunt: You can\u2019t get me!", "description": "As more testimony is disclosed, it becomes clearer that President Trump\u2019s only defense against impeachment is to distract from the facts.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/opinion/23gopWeb/23gopWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
