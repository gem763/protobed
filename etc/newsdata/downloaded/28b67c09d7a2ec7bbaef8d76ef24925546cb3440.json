She was told the advanced stage of the sarcoma meant she probably had only days left.\n\nBut in a video posted to Twitter on Tuesday, Yetman flips through a series of signs, telling Canadians that despite her \u201cvery limited time\u201d, she had managed to cast a ballot in her first federal election.\n\nMaddison (@MaddiYet) This is my last chance to make a difference. Please share this with your network and get out and vote! #whatsyourexcuse @justinpjtrudeau @andrewjscheer @jagmeetsingh @MaximeBernier @liberalca @cpc_hq @ndp @peoplespca @CanadianGreens #cdnpoli #Elxn43 #canpoli pic.twitter.com/xxfXxuOrEf\n\n\u201cIf I can find the time to vote, you can find the time to vote,\u201d Yetman says, finishing on a placard that reads: \u201c#WhatsYourExcuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has time left on this Earth that is measurable in hours and she took time to vote,\u201d her uncle, Brent Williamson, told the Canadian Press. \u201cAnd yet 30 to 35% of Canadians won\u2019t bother to go vote.\u201d\n\nThe video, which has been viewed nearly 500,000 times, has been shared by federal leaders, who praised the teen\u2019s message\n\n\u201cI\u2019m speechless. This is truly powerful, Maddison \u2013 thank you for your courage in the face of adversity,\u201d tweeted Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic party. \u201cPlease watch Maddison\u2019s video, and please hear the call to action. Your voice, like Maddison\u2019s, deserves to be heard.\u201d\n\nScandal on all sides as Canada heads for \u2018election of discontent\u2019 Read more\n\nThe prime minister, Justin Trudeau, thanked Yetman for \u201creminding us how precious a vote is\u201d.\n\nWith less than a week before Canada\u2019s general election, there is uncertainty surrounding voter turnout, following an acrimonious campaign. In early voting last week, Elections Canada reported 4.3m ballots \u2013 a surge of 29%. But experts cautioned that a holiday weekend \u2013 which made voting more convenient \u2013 was probably a large factor in encouraging early turnout.\n\nStill, Yetman\u2019s family is hopeful her message will resonate in the coming days.\n\n\u201cAt her young age she understood how important our democracy is and our political system, and really wanted to play a part in it,\u201d said Williamson. \u201c[She] got to [vote] for one election and it\u2019s pretty unfortunate she won\u2019t be around to do it for others.\u201d", "description": "Maddison Yetman, 18, tells Canadians on video that despite her \u2018limited time\u2019, she managed to cast ballot in the federal election", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7ce57543794895a890bbfd064e9f0348c553791/0_236_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4d182ee5d2d686735bbc468a7ca0d69", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
