FILE PHOTO - U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence arrives in Dublin\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday dismissed Democrats' allegations of impropriety over U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's stay at Trump's Irish resort and over a Scottish airport near a Trump-owned golf course.\n\n\"I had nothing to do with the decision of our great @VP Mike Pence to stay overnight at one of the Trump owned resorts in Doonbeg, Ireland,\" he wrote in an early-morning tweet.\n\n\"I know nothing about an Air Force plane landing at an airport (which I do not own and have nothing to do with) near Turnberry Resort (which I do own) in Scotland, and filling up with fuel, with the crew staying overnight at Turnberry (they have good taste!). NOTHING TO DO WITH ME,\" he also tweeted.\n\nDemocrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are looking into Pence's stay at the Trump International Golf Club in Doonbeg on the west coast of Ireland, which is 300 km (180 miles) away from the capital, Dublin, where his meetings were held.\n\nElijah Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, wants documents on the visit sent to the committee by Sept. 19. Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee it looking into the stay as part of an investigation of Trump's decision to host next year's Group of Seven economic summit at his Florida resort.\n\nCummings is also concerned about Prestwick Airport, looking into purchase orders for fuel totaling $11 million and reports that the airport offered cut-rate rooms for select passengers and crew, as well as free rounds of golf at Turnberry to visiting U.S. military and civilian air crews.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution bars government officials, including the president, from receiving financial benefits known as emoluments from foreign or domestic governments, without approval from Congress.\n\nTrump has remained in control of his hotels, golf courses and other businesses, though he said he handed over day-to-day operations to his sons before taking office in January 2017.\n\nHis hotel down the street from the White House in Washington has stirred the biggest controversy. Trump opened the Trump International Hotel shortly before he was elected in November 2016 and it has become a favored lodging and event space for some foreign and state officials visiting the capital. In July a federal court dismissed a lawsuit filed by Democratic attorneys general over the hotel, saying the case lacked legal standing.", "description": "Trump says he had 'nothing to do' with Pence's stay at Trump's Irish resort", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8819Q_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
