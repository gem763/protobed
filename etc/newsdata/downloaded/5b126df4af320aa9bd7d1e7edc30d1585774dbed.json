REUTERS/Nacho Doce\n\nGlobal anxiety that not enough is being done on climate change has focussed on Brazil since August when it was revealed that fires in the Amazon have surged to their highest level since 2010.\n\nEnvironmentalists blame right-wing Bolsonaro\u2019s policies favouring development over environmental protections for that and rising deforestation.\n\n\u201cThe policy of the Bolsonaro government is the policy of environmental destruction and deepening the climate crisis ... this is why we\u2019re on strike,\u201d said Marcela Pimentel Miranda, an organizer for Youth for Climate\u2019s affiliate in Brasilia, which is helping to organise the protests.\n\nOn Twitter, Brazilians tweeted #EleNao and #ForaSalles, calls to reject Bolsonaro and oust Environment Minister Ricardo Salles. Protesters criticized and mocked the two leaders with signs and costumes.\n\nSalles told Reuters on Thursday that the majority of the Amazon remains intact, showing that Brazil is doing an \u201cexcellent job\u201d to preserve the environment. On Friday, Bolsonaro authorized the military to continue firefighting efforts in the Amazon for another month.\n\nThe Amazon is the world\u2019s largest tropical rainforest, 60% of which lies in Brazil, and absorbs vast amount of greenhouse gases.\n\nSalles acknowledged the existence of man-made climate change and said protesters are right to be concerned about the future.\n\n\u201cI have children and I am concerned about their future too,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nThe demonstrations in major Brazilian cities are among thousands of protests in a global \u201cclimate strike\u201d ahead of next week\u2019s U.N. Climate Action Summit and New York Climate Week, where political, business and civil society leaders will gather to discuss the issue.\n\n\u201cI am going to New York to show the world that Bolsonaro\u2019s policies do not represent Brazil, there are other views,\u201d congresswoman Tabata Amaral, 25, a member of a new generation of Brazilian politicians, said by telephone.\n\nSmall protests in the morning gave way to major demonstrations with hundreds gathering in Rio and Brasilia, while more than two thousand amassed in downtown Sao Paulo.\n\nA few dozen people, mostly students, gathered on the steps Rio\u2019s state assembly behind a banner reading \u201cclimate justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us to have a liveable planet and future, air to breath, food and water, we need to solve this problem now,\u201d said Julia Waddington, one of the protesters.", "description": "Thousands of Brazilians demanded action on climate change on Friday, taking aim in nationwide protests at President Jair Bolsonaro who they say is allowing fires to destroy the Amazon rainforest, worsening the environmental crisis.", "authors": ["Jake Spring", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432136756&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J26H", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
