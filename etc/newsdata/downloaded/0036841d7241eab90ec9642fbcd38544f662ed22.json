But instead, the brand has optimized its offerings to be a one-stop-shop for shirts and layers that do more. And that\u2019s how I came to find the ultimate flannel shirt.\n\nThe High Sierra shirt isn\u2019t a flannel. Okay, it is, but it\u2019s so much more than that. It\u2019s really an over-shirt and a layering piece together. The flannel layer is made from a luxurious flannel from Portugal. Paired with that is a cotton, thermal lining that reminds me of the long johns my mom forced me into when I was still (unsuccessfully) attempting to enjoy skiing.\n\nThere are some additional components to this shirt that make it so much more than just a really soft flannel. There\u2019s a reinforced bottle pocket to keep your drink handy but not in your hands. There\u2019s a water-resistant dry pocket so you can keep your phone or wallet safe when you\u2019re out and about in the snowy weather. There\u2019s even a sunglasses loop in the button placket (you know, that piece of fabric the buttons are on) so you can tuck your shades in easily. They\u2019ve thought of everything!\n\nI really thought I had grown out of my flannel phase in college, but this shirt has proven me wrong. It\u2019s what I want to wear over a T-shirt for an extra layer or pair with leggings when I really don\u2019t want to get dressed. | Shop at California Cowboy >\n\nScouted selects products independently and prices reflect what was available at the time of publish.
