The school district, by the way, did not offer a comment.\n\n\u201cWe're digging into it, even more, to see if this is viewpoint discrimination or are they not wanting to teach the full history of 9/11,\u201d Brown said of the school located in a Detroit suburb. \u201cWhat is it that they're afraid of?\u201d\n\nBrown also said a YAF memorial at Stetson University in Florida was vandalized Wednesday by chalk artists who desecrated the display with anti-American rhetoric.\n\nThe \u201cNever Forget\u201d project was created by Young America\u2019s Foundation in 2003 when it realized that schools and students were not doing anything to observe the anniversary of the terrorist attacks.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of the 9/11 Never Forget project is not to be political,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe whole point of it is to observe this factual thing that happened in history.\u201d\n\nThe centerpiece of the project is an American flag display made up of 2,977 flags memorializing the people who died that day.\n\n\u201cIt's really just an opportunity for Young Americans for Freedom chapters and other conservative clubs to create a moment of remembrance at their schools and really bring the community together,\u201d Brown said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nHe said the point of the project is to \u201cremind students that these radical terrorists still pose a threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so it's important to stay vigilant against that threat to freedom,\u201d Brown said.\n\nAs I write in my new book, \u201cCulture Jihad: How to Stop the Left from Killing a Nation,\u201d the left has turned our schools into indoctrination centers \u2013 spewing anti-American propaganda.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI\u2019m not surprised that the posters were banned at that Michigan high school. It makes me wonder if school leaders were trying to whitewash history.\n\nKudos to Young America\u2019s Foundation for standing in the gap and educating future generations about the truth of September 11, 2001. It was the day when Islamic radicals waged jihad on American soil in the name of their religion.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM TODD STARNES", "description": "Students at a Michigan high school were told they could not display posters promoting Young America\u2019s Foundation\u2019s \u201c9/11 Never Forget\u201d project because the images were too violent.", "authors": ["Todd Starnes", "Todd Starnes Is Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/11/694940094001_6085426667001_6085422570001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
