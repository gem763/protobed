The average age of their partner or assailant was reported as 27 \u2014 which, Hawks noted, suggests a \u201cmajor power discrepancy.\u201d More than 26 percent of women said they were physically threatened during the encounter, and 46 percent said they were physically held down. Fifty-six percent of women said they were verbally pressured into having sex, while 16 percent of women said their partner threatened to end the relationship if they didn\u2019t have sex.\n\nThe study, one of the first to look on a national level at the prevalence of rape as a woman\u2019s first sexual experience, found that many of the women whose first sexual encounter had been rape later reported painful gynecological or pelvic conditions. These women were also more likely to report a range of health issues, including unwanted first pregnancies, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and poor overall health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important wake-up call that this [kind of experience] can be associated with adverse health outcomes relatively early in life,\u201d Alison Huang, an associate professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, told NPR. \u201cIt poses a lot of questions about what happens to women later in life. It\u2019s very possible that the negative effects of forced sexual initiations may persist or show more in time.\u201d", "description": "Six and a half percent of American women say their first sexual experience was rape, according to a study published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association.", "authors": ["Erica Schwiegershausen"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/16/16-jama-study.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
