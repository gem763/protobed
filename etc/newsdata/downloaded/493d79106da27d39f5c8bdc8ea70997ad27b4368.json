Robbins, acting executive associate director at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said that\u2019s just one city in a state where sanctuary policies are now a law state wide.\n\nHe said before the law took effect in 2018 the Los Angeles area turned over 75 to 100 criminal aliens each day. Now, he said ICE gets fewer than five.\n\n\u201cAll things being equal, there are 70 to 100 criminal aliens hitting the streets in Los Angeles alone. That is one city within the United States. This is a significant problem that has been overlooked for too long,\u201d he said\n\nHis comments came during a hearing in the Senate, called to examine the dangers of the growing sanctuary movement.\n\nRepublicans have vowed to move legislation to crack down on sanctuaries.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, is proposing a bill that would still allow sanctuary cities to refuse cooperation, as many of them want to do, but would then make them liable to a civil lawsuit from anyone who was victimized by a migrant released under a sanctuary policy.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
