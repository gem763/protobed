So he hired an emotional support clown to join him.\n\nFor Joshua Jack, the suspicion he might lose his job was right.\n\nSpeaking to Newshub NZ on a video call, Jack confirmed his employer, advertising agency FCB, let him go this week. But having Joe the clown along for the ride definitely \u201clightened the mood,\u201d he said.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhen his supervisors scheduled the meeting, he said he \u201cthought it's either a promotion or worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought it's best to bring in a professional and so I paid $200 and hired a clown,\u201d he added.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But he did have two balloon animals: a unicorn and a poodle.\n\nThe process to blow them up and shape them got \u201crather noisy,\u201d he said, and the meeting attendees \u201chad to tell [Joe the clown] to be quiet from time to time.\u201d\n\nFCB could not immediately be reached for comment. But the New Zealand Herald obtained a photograph showing a man with his face blurred out sitting in an office next to a clown, who is wearing, well, a clown outfit, and what appears to be an inflatable hat. The clown reportedly also mimed crying expressions as Jack went over the paperwork describing his termination.\n\nWhen asked by Newshub NZ how his former colleagues reacted, Jack said they \u201cthought it spiced up the meeting.\u201d\n\nEmotional support clowns are typically used in situations with children that require a bit more, well, emotional support.\n\nThe US branch of Clowns Without Borders opened in 1995, and describes itself as an organisation that \u201cbrings laughter where it's needed most.\u201d The group sends clowns on missions to conflict zones, refugee camps and places experiencing emergencies to play with children and offer them an opportunity to momentarily escape their suffering.\n\nNot everyone, however, perceives clowns as sources of joy.\n\nIn recent years there have been increased reports of frightening clowns threatening people in both the United States and the United Kingdom. In 2016, a school district in Ohio even shut down schools after reported clown sightings caused widespread panic.\n\nThe American clown craze soon spread to the United Kingdom, where police said clown sightings increased in 2016.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

When photos of Daniel the duck went viral on social media, she said she was surprised by the attention. \u201cHaving an emotional support duck is normal - it's my new normal,\u201d she said.\n\nDelta Air Lines tightened restrictions on emotional support animals last year after the number of passengers trying to bring them on board skyrocketed, which in turn led to a dramatic uptick in incidents where passengers were attacked by animals on board.\n\nAs for Jack, he has since found a new job and starts next week, he told Newshub NZ. The Washington Post has been unable to confirm if Joe the clown will be by his side on his first day.", "description": "A man in New Zealand was called into a work meeting and feared the worst.
