It\u2019s not this dramatic. I don\u2019t usually do anything to my hair, just wash it and put my hands through it.\n\nHow has your look changed with age? I wear much less makeup now. At one time I would have been contouring, but I wouldn\u2019t dream of doing it these days.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Maggie Wright\n\nDo you feel beauty brands cater for you? Yes, more so than they used to \u2013 especially when you\u2019ve got people such as Isabella Rossellini as the face of Lanc\u00f4me.\n\nWho is your beauty inspiration? Lauren Bacall. It\u2019s completely unattainable and not my style, but she always looks naturally elegant, intelligent, sassy and in control.\n\nWhat has been your biggest makeup disaster? I\u2019ve had a few Oompa Loompa moments using fake tan.\n\nTop tip? Sun protection \u2013 I aim for factor 30-50, as I spend a lot of time on my allotment.\n\nWhat Nina Fay Robinson, our make up artist, did for Maggie Glossier\u2019s Boy Brow gives unbeatable brows. Add a barely-there base with the brand\u2019s Perfecting Skin Tint and highlight with Haloscope in Moonstone.\n\nDi Donaldson, 56, wears eyelash extensions\n\nWhat\u2019s your usual look? I generally wear only a light foundation with Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s Double Wear light mascara.\n\nHow has your look changed with age? I use less makeup. I used to put kohl on my bottom rim but found it closed my eyes up as opposed to opening them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Di Donaldson\n\nDo you feel beauty brands cater for you? The industry preys on women needing to look younger and younger, as opposed to embracing the lines and wrinkles, with creams and potions that claim to \u201chalt signs of ageing\u201d. I do not use any of them \u2013 too many chemicals.\n\nWho is your beauty inspiration? Grace Jones, for growing old disgracefully, and that skin! Lauren Hutton for her pure style, and Maya Angelou for being a woman\u2019s woman \u2013 and what a face.\n\nWhat has been your biggest makeup disaster? A sky-blue eyeshadow in 1970.\n\nTop tip? I make my own facewash and moisturiser, wear a light foundation to protect from everyday dust and pollution, always remove makeup and keep a positive attitude. Smiling helps to keep the glow \u2013 and I could not live without wheatgerm oil.\n\nWhat Nina Fay Robinson, our make up artist, did for Di Nars featherlight liquid illuminator in Hot Sand is great for cheeks and brows. Lend a fun dash of colour to eyes with Rimmel Wonder\u2019Swipe in Yassss.\n\nJoan Williams, 60, wears red lipstick\n\nWhat\u2019s your usual look? I don\u2019t generally wear makeup on a daily basis; when I do, it\u2019s really just a foundation base.\n\nHow has your look changed with age? I never wore makeup when I was younger. But as I approached 40, I began to explore and now that my daughter is older and has an interest in it, she often uses me as a guinea pig to experiment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joan Williams Photograph: Misha Meghna/The Guardian\n\nDo you feel beauty brands cater for you? Higher-end brands do more than chemists\u2019 products; there\u2019s more variety.\n\nWho is your beauty inspiration? My daughter, Leanne \u2013 she encourages me to try new things.\n\nWhat has been your biggest makeup disaster? I\u2019ve had a couple of funny experiences trying to find the right shade of foundation.\n\nTop tip? Moisturise, moisturise and moisturise some more!\n\nWhat Nina Fay Robinson, our make up artist, did for Joan Nars Natural Radiant Longwear foundation in Macao gives an even base. Add contour with Fenty\u2019s Sun Stalk\u2019r bronzer in Mocha Mami and finish with MAC\u2019s Diva lipstick \u2013 a bold, elegant red.\n\nFabia Khan, 56, wears bold eyeshadow\n\nWhat\u2019s your usual look? I wouldn\u2019t normally wear yellow eyeshadow or accentuate my lips. I prefer to wear subtle pink lipstick and brown tones on my eyelids.\n\nHow has your look changed with age? I wear cream blush, use less mascara and wear a foundation that doesn\u2019t require a powder finish, to avoid drawing attention to wrinkles.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fabia Khan.

I never struggle to find what I want.\n\nWho is your beauty inspiration? Rihanna with her Fenty lip glosses.\n\nWhat has been your biggest makeup disaster? Wearing orange lipstick with a pink blouse once, back in the 80s. But these two together are fashionable now.\n\nTop tip? Beauty comes from within. A smile from the heart can add beauty to a face. More practically, in hot weather, put your lipstick in the fridge: it will keep its consistency and apply better to your lips, and will stay on for longer.\n\nWhat Nina Fay Robinson, our make up artist, did for Fabia Kryolan\u2019s multipurpose pencil in 901 is a great staple. Add Nars Creamy Concealer and make a statement with MAC\u2019s Pigment.", "description": "After trying out beauty trends in our shoot, four women reveal their go-to products and top tipsRead more from the autumn/winter 2019 edition of The Fashion, our biannual fashion supplement", "authors": ["Photography Misha Megna"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a80852aa1f2f61bf69ffa268be412c5e50985c4/0_0_7111_4267/master/7111.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=96afeeaf6a32681ab3b5c9c9f23cd66d", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
