They buy a stake and come in and agitate for a break-up of the business or some kind of catalyst to unlock value. I feel like those are smash and grabs,\" Ms Howitt said.\n\nIn those situations, \"boards need to hear from longer term investors\".\n\n\"You find that management feel all their shareholders just want earnings upgrades for the next six months, and the next six months, and it\u2019s important for us to go and say, 'no, we will back you if you invest to make your business more resilient for the future',\" Ms Howitt said.", "description": "It's more challenging to find cheap companies as interest rates fall, but equities are still less expensive than other assets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3232%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_155%2C$y_125/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/44fef716e61c0e874f47a1d0bacfdbfa160ab748", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
