While the earnings calendar remains light for the week, a couple of key events will be in focus for investors.\n\nMarket watchers will be able to gauge the health of the U.S. labor market Friday when the August jobs report is released. Economists polled by Bloomberg are expecting the U.S. economy to have added 159,000 jobs in August, down from the 164,000 added in July. The unemployment rate is anticipated to have held steady at 3.7%.\n\nThough job gains have slowed from last year, consensus remains that the pace has still remained largely solid. \u201cEmployment growth should continue to hold up in August, giving the Fed no reason to adjust its July meeting characterization of the labor market as \u2018strong,\u2019 Wells Fargo said in a note Friday. \u201cThe six-month moving average of nonfarm gains has certainly come down, especially relative to last year\u2019s impressive pace, but continued gradual labor market tightening has kept income and spending rising.\u201d\n\nCredit Suisse economist James Sweeney argued that the labor market is not immune from broader growth weakness, and thus, job gains will continue to moderate. \u201cJob gains are slowing to a more-sustainable pace after several strong years, which should keep headline unemployment in its current range.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Sweeney pointed out that the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its preliminary revisions for 2018-2019 employment figures. \u201cNormally, this annual revision is small, but this year, it will subtract around 500K jobs from annual employment growth (~40k per month),\u201d Credit Suisse wrote in a note Thursday. \u201cThis does not impact forward-looking data, but it does make the current slowdown in job gains appear to be part of a multi-year trend rather than a sharp momentum reversal.\u201d\n\nThe August jobs report will be released this week. More\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve will be releasing its Beige Book on Wednesday and Chairman Jerome Powell will be speaking in Zurich on Friday at 12:30 p.m. ET on \u201cEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy.\u201d\n\nInvestors have been hyper-focused on the Fed in recent days as the September policy meeting approaches. Markets are expecting another rate cut at this month\u2019s meeting following the central bank\u2019s first interest rate cut in more than a decade at its July meeting.\n\nA couple of weeks ago at the Jackson Hole conference, Powell expressed that the Fed would do what it needs in order to prolong the current economic expansion. He explained that the U.S. is facing more challenges now than it was at the Fed\u2019s most recent policy meeting. \u201c\u201cThe three weeks since our July FOMC meeting have been eventful, beginning with the announcement of new tariffs on imports from China,\u201d Powell said in Jackson Hole. On Sunday, 15% U.S. tariffs were added on more than $100 billion worth of Chinese imports, as the trade war between the U.S. and China continues to rage on.\n\nSome economists believe that the trade tensions aren\u2019t too worrisome. \u201cThe trade dispute with China may be escalating at a rapid pace but, despite the concerns of Fed officials, there is still little evidence that this is having a significant impact on the economy,\u201d Capital Economics wrote in a note Friday.\n\nNevertheless, while some firmly believe that the economy is still strong, and some believe the headwinds facing the economy should not be ignored, Powell\u2019s speech on Friday will be closely monitored for any additional insight into what the Fed\u2019s assessment of the current economic situation is, as it plots its next policy move.\n\nEconomic calendar\n\nMonday: Markets closed in observance of Labor Day\n\nTuesday: Markit US Manufacturing PMI, August final (50.0 expected, 49.9 in July); ISM Manufacturing, August (51.2 expected, 51.2 in July); ISM Prices Paid, August (46.8 expected, 45.1 in July); Construction Spending month-on-month, July (0.3% expected, -1.3% in June)", "description": "It will be a shortening trading week, but the focus will be on the August jobs report and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech on Friday.", "authors": ["Heidi Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QHSYq3qcQ6jVqEvT2n4UTA--~B/aD0yNjA0O3c9MzcwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/6b642be0-9d8c-11e9-beff-5ed2474823ab"}
