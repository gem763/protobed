(AP) - Oakland Raiders rookie cornerback Trayvon Mullen spent his freshman year in college trying to knock down passes from Deshaun Watson during practice while both were at Clemson. The two will meet again Sunday when Mullen makes his first NFL start against Watson and the Houston Texans.\n\nThe 40th overall pick in this year\u2019s draft, Mullen is getting the first crack at replacing former first-round pick Gareon Conley as Oakland\u2019s left cornerback. Conley was traded to the Texans this week in exchange for a 2020 third-round pick.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity at hand so I\u2019m ready,\u201d Mullen said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got guys on the team that are ready for me to show what I can do and ready for me to show I\u2019ve got their backs. I\u2019ve got a lot to prove and a lot to stand up to.\u201d\n\nThe move to trade Conley was the latest in a series of deals the Raiders have made since hiring general manager Mike Mayock, significantly altering a roster that coach Jon Gruden inherited when he was hired in January 2018.\n\nConley missed most of his rookie season injured but started 20 of next 22 games he played in, including all six this season. Mullen, by comparison, has been on the field for only 14 defensive snaps over Oakland\u2019s past three games, including just one in last week\u2019s loss to Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.\n\nNow Mullen will go against his former college teammate. Watson was in final season at Clemson when Mullen arrived as a fresh-faced freshman.\n\n\u201cGoing against him in practice, I can say it made me better for that time that I was there,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cWatching him and being that freshman in college and the type of player he was, I know for sure he made me better in practice when I did have the opportunity to go against him.\u201d\n\nRaiders defensive lineman Clelin Ferrell was at Clemson while both Watson and Mullen were there and remembers watching the two go at it in practice, when Watson was throwing passes to current San Diego Chargers wide receiver Mike Williams.\n\n\u201cHe came in freshman year and he had to go against Mike Williams every day in practice with Deshaun at quarterback,\u201d Ferrell said. \u201cCoach (Dabo) Swinney used to call them out one on one. Stop the whole practice and call them out one on one. It\u2019d be Trayon and Mike, and best man would win.\u201d\n\nSo who won more?\n\n\u201cProbably Mike,\u201d Ferrell said. \u201cTrayvon won some of them but Mike won more.\u201d\n\nGruden expects Watson to target Mullen frequently on Sunday, knowing it\u2019s the rookie\u2019s first start. It\u2019s the NFL\u2019s natural food chain.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be challenged, I know that,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cBut I think his makeup is perfect. He\u2019s a very confident, well-prepared kid. We\u2019ll see what happens. I\u2019m not going to make any predictions. We\u2019ll get what we deserve at every position, including corner. I know he\u2019s going to be tested and I\u2019m anxious to see him compete.\u201d\n\nRather than look at it as a negative, Mullen sees the likely extra attention as an opportunity to showcase himself.\n\n\u201cMost definitely. Give me a chance to make plays,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m prepared and I prepare myself weekly and daily for those type of situations because you never know.\u201d\n\nNotes: WR Tyrell Williams (foot) returned to practice but is still questionable. Right tackle Trent Brown (calf) was limited. Running back Josh Jacobs (shoulder), right guard Gabe Jackson (knee) and center Rodney Hudson (ankle) were all held out of practice. . The Raiders signed defensive end Kasim Edebali, who last played in the NFL in 2018 with Cincinnati.\n\n__\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Oakland Raiders rookie cornerback Trayvon Mullen spent his freshman year in college trying to knock down passes from Deshaun Watson during practice while both were at Clemson.
