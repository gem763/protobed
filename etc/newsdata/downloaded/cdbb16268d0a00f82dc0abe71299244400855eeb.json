In it, Kristen Bell talks with fellow celebrity mom Jennifer Garner about child birth and IT. IS. HILARIOUS.\n\nThe two have \"baked\" five kids between them, so they sat down with new mamas to talk, well, EVERYTHING.\n\n'It's going to look like a homicide'\n\nOne pregnant woman, Emily, shares that she is starting to get a little bit nervous about labor.\n\n\"I think it is the most romantic day you'll ever experience,\" Garner says, clearly trying to be nice. Then Bell chimes in:\n\n\"You're a better person than I am because I was going to say, 'It's going to look like a homicide.' There's way more blood than you think there should be.\"\n\nBell tells the expectant mom that her best advice for her is to write a birth plan and really take time to think about it. Bell holds up an example of a birth plan, then proceeds to rip it into shreds and toss it aside.\n\n\"It's never going to happen like that and so get rid of it,\" Bell jokes.\n\nWater broke? Not exactly.\n\nAt the end of the clip, Bell shares a story about the moment her \"water broke.\" She shares two daughters with her husband and actor Dax Shepard.\n\n\"I was standing in the bathroom, my first child, and I was like, 'Honey, my water broke. I'm so excited. Let's call the doctor.' \"\n\nAt the doctor's office, Bell assured her doctor that there was \"big splash\" on the bathroom floor.\n\n\"Your water didn't break, but it is quite possible that you peed your pants,'\" Bell retells her doctor's words.\n\nToo funny.\n\nCatch more episodes of \"Momsplaining\" on Mondays on ellentube.com and Ellen\u2019s YouTube channel if you want a female anatomy lesson and more real tales of motherhood.\n\nREAD MORE", "description": "Kristen Bell is back for season 4 of \"Momsplaining\" on \"Ellen\" and it could be the most provocative yet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/16/USAT/2727f3e8-68ba-4139-a34e-a15e7d738e20-Haas_Rozman_17009_20190918_0133.JPG?crop=2999,1687,x0,y223&width=2362&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
