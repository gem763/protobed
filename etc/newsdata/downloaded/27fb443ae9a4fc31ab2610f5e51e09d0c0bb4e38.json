ANU astronomer Dougal Mackey says through studying our neighbouring galaxy, we found \u201cAndromeda had a pretty big breakfast maybe ten billion years ago\u201d and a \u201cdecent lunch much more recently, between two to three billion years ago\u201d. Mr Mackey told Sky News astronomers are able to tell that these are different events because \u201cthe remains of these destroyed galaxies and are moving on different orbits around Andromeda\u201d. According to the astronomer, Andromeda has its sights set on the Milky Way as its next main course, but it is not expected to happen for at least another four billion years.
