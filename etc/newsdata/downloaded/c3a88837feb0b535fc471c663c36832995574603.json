If she were able to bring the case to a public court, the cost would only be $450 in court fees.\n\nWard told HuffPost she had no idea what she was getting into when she agreed to submit to arbitration as part of her employment contract. She certainly didn\u2019t know how much money it would cost.\n\n\u201cIt is financially a train wreck to be staring at these bills,\u201d Ward told HuffPost Tuesday, speaking from her home in North Carolina. EYs response is discouraging and disappointing, she said. The notion that the firm is a good place for women to work is insulting: Ward complained of mistreatment, discrimination and harassment when she was working at EY throughout her time there, she said.\n\nWard filed her case against EY last October, detailing how her boss harassed her \u2015 commenting on her \u201cboobs\u201d and \u201cass\u201d and relegating her to the back of the room with the \u201cgals\u201d at a major conference. She says she was retaliated against and ultimately fired for speaking up about mistreatment. A subsequent HuffPost investigation uncovered emails and other evidence detailing the volume of complaints Ward lodged when she was at the company \u2015 and her growing frustration with the firm\u2019s response.\n\nEY says Ward was fired for her performance.\n\nStill, Ward had hoped EY would back down about arbitration in the face of mounting pressure over her case. After HuffPost reported on Ward\u2019s mounting legal costs in arbitration, a bipartisan group of New York state legislators slammed the company for hypocrisy in an open letter last month. They urged EY to release Ward from her arbitration agreement.\n\nErnst & Young cannot be a leader on gender equality while it is so far behind the curve in addressing workplace harassment. open letter from New York state legislators\n\n\u201cIt is disturbing that Ernst & Young is unwilling to recognize the negative impact arbitration requirements have on the ability of workers to get a fair hearing,\u201d said the letter, signed by 67 legislators. \u201cErnst & Young cannot be a leader on gender equality while it is so far behind the curve in addressing workplace harassment.\u201d\n\nReached by email on Tuesday, Rep. Maloney chastised EY.\n\n\u201cI am deeply disappointed that Ernst & Young does not recognize how their forced arbitration policies undermine the fight against sexual harassment and gender equality,\u201d she said. \u201cIts decision to inflict financial and emotional distress upon Karen Ward, whom I applaud for her courage and determination, is wrongheaded and must stop. Ernst & Young should immediately free Karen Ward from these harmful policies that promote discrimination and protect abusers.\u201d\n\nWard penned an open letter to EY\u2019s new global chairman and CEO, Carmine Di Sibio, pleading to be released from the arbitration agreement after the legislators spoke up.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of message do you think EY is sending about its values when it requires female employees to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to pursue claims of sexual harassment behind closed doors in arbitration?\u201d Ward wrote.\n\nThe 49-year-old Ward had worked for years in finance and said that nothing had prepared her for the boys club culture of EY. \u201cThe frat culture I experienced at EY was beyond anything I ever read that Wall Street could be like,\u201d said Ward on Tuesday.\n\nShe said she received little to no support from women who worked there, because very few women were leaders in the company. \u201cNo woman ever came to me,\u201d said Ward, who worked in a group with almost no senior women. \u201cI would\u2019ve gone to a woman in my chain of command if there were any.\u201d\n\nWard\u2019s case was the second harassment charge filed against the firm in 2018 \u2015 another former female partner settled claims that EY did nothing after she was groped by a male colleague.\n\nThe letter from Hauben last week was a response to Ward\u2019s recent missive \u2015 and did not mention the state legislators\u2019 response.\n\nHe seems to argue that because Ward was well-compensated as a partner at the firm, sharing the costs of dispute resolution was justified. \u201cHaving accepted the benefits of being an EY partner,\u201d he wrote, \u201cshe is also bound by these ... provisions.\u201d\n\nHauben insists that Ward\u2019s claims are without merit, a claim EY reiterated in statements to HuffPost and publicly since she filed her charges.\n\n\u201cEY is aggressively defending itself against these baseless claims,\u201d the firm said.\n\nHe also noted that they have a female leader. \u201cWe are proud that our US Chair and Managing Partner is a woman,\u201d he wrote in the letter dated Aug. 9. \u201cEY has a longstanding commitment to diversity, fairness and equity and a strong and recognized track record of being a great place to work for women.\u201d\n\nA supportive professional environment for women would not force female employees to sign away their rights to go to court when they\u2019re sexually harassed, force them to take their grievances to a private, confidential forum and pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to have their case heard, said David Gottlieb, a partner at Wigdor, the New York law firm representing Ward.\n\n\u201cIt is completely self-serving and inaccurate for a company to say they\u2019re a great place to work for women without acknowledging this is an unjust practice,\u201d he said.\n\nArbitration is widely believed to benefit companies at the expense of employees, who are less likely to win cases before these secretive courts. Even when they do win, research has found monetary judgments are typically smaller than they\u2019d be in public courtrooms.\n\nThere are a few bills before Congress that would eradicate forced arbitration in cases of sexual harassment, including the FAIR Act. New York state recently banned the practice \u2015 though it\u2019s expected that the provision will be overturned in court. And a few major companies voluntarily gave it up, including Facebook, Microsoft and Uber.\n\nWard said that she\u2019s heard from dozens of women bound by arbitration agreements, including some EY workers.\n\n\u201cThey see that the cost can cause financial ruin and they choose to live with injustice,\u201d Ward said, emphasizing how inspiring and gut-wrenching it\u2019s been to hear all their stories from people at all kinds of levels. \u201cSome of the assault that\u2019s occurred is shocking,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m left reeling.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s for these women and others that Ward said she\u2019ll continue to fight this case with EY.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do whatever it takes to be heard,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me and my costs, although that\u2019s incredibly difficult to bear. Enough is enough.\u201d", "description": "The firm insists it\u2019s a great place for women to work, despite forcing Karen Ward to pay hundreds of thousands just to have her case heard.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d372d072600004f000453e7.jpeg?cache=wcqaef4puf&ops=1778_1000"}
