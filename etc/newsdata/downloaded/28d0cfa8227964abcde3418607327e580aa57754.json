But watching Trump risk impeachment to try to blow up Grandpa Joe at this stage of the race is like if Obama had bet his presidency on taking out Jeb Bush circa July 2015.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to go nuclear on a frontrunner who isn\u2019t really the frontrunner anymore.\n\nAccording to USA Today/Ipsos, 42 percent say there are good reasons to investigate the Biden\u2019s Ukrainian activities versus just 21 percent who say there aren\u2019t. Even a quarter of Democrats agree. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that skepticism about the Bidens\u2019 shadiness doesn\u2019t seem to be undercutting interest in impeachment. Or in removal:\n\nAmericans by a 45%-38% plurality now support a vote by the House of Representatives to impeach President Donald Trump, a USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll finds, as allegations continue to swirl around an embattled White House. By a similar margin, 44%-35%, those surveyed say the Senate, which would then be charged with holding a trial of the president, should convict Trump and remove him from office\u2026 Americans have long been wary of impeachment. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll taken in June \u2013 months before the formal impeachment inquiry was launched last week \u2013 found opponents outweighing supporters by nearly 2 to 1, 61%-32%\u2026 One more warning sign for Trump: Nearly two-thirds of Republicans say there isn\u2019t enough reliable information to decide whether he should be impeached. That leaves open the possibility that dramatic disclosures and persuasive evidence could convince some in Trump\u2019s own party that impeachment is warranted.\n\nFrom a -29 net split on impeachment in June to a +7 net divide now. Thirty-six points is a big turnaround. The most ominous number is that last one, though, showing even many Republicans remain willing to reserve judgment for now. USA Today notes at one point that \u201cjust\u201d 17 percent of Republicans currently support impeachment, but 17 percent isn\u2019t negligible on a question as momentous as this. (Harry Enten notes that the sort of moderate Republicans who are more likely to support impeachment are also overrepresented in key Rust Belt states.) It\u2019s not a huge deal for Senate Republicans to find 45 percent of the public in favor of impeaching, as virtually any hotly contested partisan issue in 2019 will draw at least that much support via one party or the other. The noteworthy figure is the 38 percent in opposition; that number \u201cshould\u201d be higher considering that Trump regularly registers a job approval in the low 40s. There\u2019s a small but potentially dangerous GOP minority here that\u2019s not ready yet to view this through the familiar partisan prism. Maybe yesterday\u2019s Adam Schiff revelation will get them there.\n\nBut then, maybe this morning\u2019s Trump statement on the White House lawn will drive them further away from it.\n\nSpeaking of Trump\u2019s job approval, there continue to be some good polls for him amid this Ukraine clusterfark. Rasmussen (which is usually good for him) has him at 47 percent today. And the Hill/Harris X has him up to 49 percent, his single best mark of the year. Is that the smoking gun that impeachment is beginning to backfire on Democrats already? Probably not \u2014 for the moment, the RCP poll average shows Trump having *lost* a few points since a surge in late September.\n\nFiveThirtyEight\u2019s tracker also sees a loss of around two points or so over the past few weeks. That\u2019s not disastrous: Trump\u2019s RCP approval of 43.2 percent today is right in line with his average approval for the past 18 months. He had been rising in late September, though, even touching 45 percent for a day before the Ukraine stuff began to bog him down. If you want to see some real poll erosion, go look at the trend in Biden\u2019s polling against Elizabeth Warren. He\u2019s at 26.2 percent today, which is close to his worst number in the primaries this year; Warren, meanwhile, is at 24.0 percent, easily her best number of the campaign. She\u2019s gained seven points in the past 17 days and has led in two of the last three national polls taken. We\u2019re closer than we think to a political reality in which the Ukraine matter, which was supposed to be a weapon exclusively for the right to use against the left, becomes a weapon exclusively for the left to use against the right.\n\nHere\u2019s Biden warning Trump yesterday before a throng of supporters, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me.\u201d True. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s going to do it. Exit question: If Trump is telling the truth when he says that his interest in Biden\u2019s Ukraine conduct is all about exposing government corruption, not accruing political advantage against an electoral opponent, then we should continue to hear from him frequently about the Bidens and Ukraine long after Grandpa Joe\u2019s polls tank and he becomes an also-ran in the race, right?
