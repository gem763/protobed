Argentine law requires a candidate to garner 45 percent or more of the vote to win outright, or 40 percent with a 10-point advantage over his closest rival.\n\nAt around 10:20 p.m. local time (1920 GMT), Macri took the stage at his campaign headquarters and called for a smooth transfer of power.\n\nFernandez, born in 1959, graduated from Law School at the University of Buenos Aires. He served as chief of the Cabinet of Ministers from 2003 to 2008.", "description": "Argentine President Mauricio Macri conceded defeat in the presidential election, congratulating rival Alberto Fernandez on winning election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/28/5db67f29a310cf3e97a3385d.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
