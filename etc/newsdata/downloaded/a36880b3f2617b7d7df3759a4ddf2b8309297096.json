If they were more interested in protecting their star anchor than protecting the women of the company.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere needs to be an outside investigation into this company,\u201d she added. \u201cThey investigated themselves. That doesn\u2019t work. Fox News had an outside investigator. CBS News had an outside investigator. NPR, the NFL. This is how it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nNBC News chief Noah Oppenheim has pushed back on the claims in Farrow's book, calling some of the allegations a \"smear\" and \"conspiracy theory\" while defending the network's handling of Farrow's reporting and insisting they had no advance knowledge of Lauer's behavior.\n\nKelly, meanwhile, called on NBC to release any former or current NBC employees who have accused Lauer of sexual misconduct from any confidentiality agreements.\n\nNoting that there\u2019s a \u201clegal sleight-of-hand\u201d that NBC could have used to hide any settlement made to an accuser by calling it \u201cenhanced severance,\u201d Kelly said the network needed to disclose any payouts.\n\n\u201cThe number one thing that needs to happen now is they need to release any and all Matt Lauer accusers from their confidentiality agreements,\u201d she declared. \u201cNBC says it has nothing to hide. Great! Let\u2019s not hide anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cShow us all of the agreements, the enhanced severance agreements that were reached or at least the numbers, so we can see which ones pop out and which ones were super high,\u201d Kelly added.\n\nCarlson announced the Kelly interview during his Monday night broadcast, suggesting at that time that Kelly would largely be focused on the current turmoil at her former home NBC while saying he was sure she\u2019d have a \u201clot to say.\u201d\n\nFox News, meanwhile, made sure to quickly tamp down on any speculation that Kelly could be making a potential return, especially in the wake of longtime anchor Shep Smith\u2019s sudden departure.\n\n\u201cMegyn Kelly\u2019s forthcoming guest appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight was coordinated weeks ago and is a one-time occurrence,\u201d a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cAny future programming changes we are considering do not involve her.\u201d\n\nCarlson booking the Kelly interview, however, was a sore spot for many at Fox News. Multiple sources told The Daily Beast that nighttime hosts Martha MacCallum, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham were \u201cspooked and irked by the prospect of Kelly\u2019s return,\u201d prompting Fox News chief Suzanne Scott to reassure each one individually that their jobs were safe.\n\nKelly, who played a prominent role in the downfall of former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes in July 2016, is also downplaying any speculation that she\u2019s looking to come back to the network that made her a star. A source familiar with her thinking told the Beast that she \u201chas a good relationship with Lachlan [Murdoch] and Tucker, among others, but left Fox News for good reason and has no intention of going back.\u201d", "description": "\u201cThey investigated themselves.
