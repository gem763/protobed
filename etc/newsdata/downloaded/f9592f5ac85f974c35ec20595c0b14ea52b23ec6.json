REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico\u2019s foreign minister said on Saturday that President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump had agreed to take swift action to stem the flow of illegal weapons from the United States into Mexico.\n\nLopez Obrador told Trump on a phone call that technology could be used to halt the weapons entering Mexico, to which Trump responded that it was a \u201cgood idea,\u201d Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told reporters.\n\nThe two leaders agreed that U.S. and Mexican officials would meet in the next few days to discuss options, and would announce actions to \u201cfreeze\u201d illegal imports of weapons into Mexico through U.S. border crossings.\n\nThe discussion came in the wake of Mexican authorities\u2019 bungled attempt to arrest a drug kingpin\u2019s son, which prompted a wave of violence in the northwestern city of Culiacan.\n\nCartel gunmen surrounded about 35 police and national guard on Thursday in the capital of Sinaloa state and made them free Ovidio Guzman, one of jailed drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman\u2019s dozen or so children. Ovidio Guzman\u2019s brief detention had set off widespread gun battles and a jailbreak that stunned the country.\n\n\u201cIf the order would have been given to continue with the operation in Culiacan we estimate that more than 200 people, mostly civilians, would have been killed,\u201d said Ebrard, adding that so-called \u201ccollateral damage\u201d was unacceptable to the Mexican government.\n\nThe chaos in Culiacan, a bastion of the elder Guzman\u2019s Sinaloa cartel, has turned up pressure on Lopez Obrador, who took office in December promising to pacify a country weary of more than a decade of gang violence.", "description": "Mexico's foreign minister said on Saturday that President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump had agreed to take swift action to stem the flow of illegal weapons from the United States into Mexico.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442719743&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0GN", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
