And so it is with this first report of quantum computational supremacy.\"\n\nGoogle's CEO Sundar Pichai tweeted Wednesday he was \"very proud\" of the team's \"big breakthrough\".\n\n\n\n\n\n- Not so fast? -\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quest for quantum supremacy is still far from over, however. The authors themselves acknowledge the need for better hardware and more sophisticated monitoring techniques in order to truly harness the power of quantum.\n\nSome immediate applications of quantum computing could be in encryption software and AI, but its calculations could eventually lead to more efficient solar panels, drug design and even quicker and better financial transactions.\n\nWednesday's announcement was not without controversy.\n\nAfter a leaked draft of the Google lab's paper appeared online last month, chip-maker IBM, which runs its own quantum computing programme, said the boasts of the Sycamore computer's feats were exaggerated.\n\nInstead of 10,000 years for an ordinary supercomputer to match Sycamore's performance, IBM scientists in a blog post claimed it would be more like two-and-a-half years using the most sophisticated traditional processors.\n\n\"Because the original meaning of the term 'quantum supremacy'... was to describe the point where quantum computers can do things that classical computers can't, this threshold has not been met,\" they wrote.\n\npg/jj", "description": "Scientists claimed Wednesday to have achieved a near-mythical state of computing in which a new generation of machine vastly outperforms the world's fastest super-computer, known as \"quantum supremacy\".
