Disney purchased Lucasfilm for $4 billion in October 2012 and relaunched the Skywalker saga with director J.J. Abrams\u2019 \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d in 2015. Since then, Disney has aggressively put out new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies, and the company\u2019s CEO Bob Iger admits to The New York Times that the plan might have been too much.\n\n\u201cI just think that we might\u2019ve put a little bit too much in the marketplace too fast,\u201d Iger said about the response to \u201cStar Wars\u201d under Disney. \u201cI think the storytelling capabilities of the company are endless because of the talent we have at the company, and the talent we have at the company is better than it\u2019s ever been, in part because of the influx of people from Fox.\u201d\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nOne year after \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d opened to critical acclaim and huge box-office returns in 2015 \u2014 with $936 million, the movie remains the highest-grossing domestic release in history, unadjusted for inflation \u2014 Disney launched the first \u201cStar Wars\u201d spinoff movie, \u201cRogue One.\u201d The Felicity Jones-led adventure grossed more than $1 billion and was followed, in 2017, by \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d (another billion-dollar grosser), which was then tailed only several months later in 2018 by spinoff \u201cSolo.\u201d The \u201cSolo\u201d release was a notorious flop for Lucasfilm and Disney. The movie didn\u2019t break $400 million worldwide and tapped out domestically with just $213 million.\n\nMany people in the industry felt \u201cStar Wars\u201d fatigue hurt \u201cSolo\u201d at the box office (although the mixed reviews didn\u2019t help either), and it appears Iger agrees Disney put out too many \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies too fast and stymied interest in the overall property. Ron Howard, who stepped in to direct \u201cSolo\u201d after Lucasfilm parted ways with original directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, told MTV\u2019s \u201cHappy Sad Confused\u201d podcast earlier this year that he believed \u201cStar Wars\u201d fatigue was indeed part of the reason \u201cSolo\u201d nosedived at the box office.\n\nThe next \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie, \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker,\u201d arrives in theaters this holiday season, well over a year after \u201cSolo.\u201d Disney is certainly hoping the longer gap between \u201cStar Wars\u201d efforts increases the demand for \u201cThe Rise of Skywalker.\u201d The movie opens nationwide December 20 from Disney.\n\nSign up for Indiewire's Newsletter.
