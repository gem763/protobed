This immensely popular book established the perception of Kurdistan in central Europe: a place of brutal tribal warfare, na\u00efve honesty and sense of honour, but also superstition, betrayal, and permanent cruel warfare. It was almost a caricature of the barbaric Other in European civilization.\n\nIf we look at today\u2019s Kurds, we cannot but be surprised by the contrast to this clich\u00e9 \u2013 in Turkey, where I know the situation relatively well, I have noticed that the Kurdish minority is the most modern and secular part of society, at a distance from every religious fundamentalism, with developed feminism, etc. (Let me just mention a detail that I learned in Istanbul: restaurants owned by Kurds have no tolerance for any sign of superstition\u2026)\n\nThe stable genius (Trump\u2019s self-designation) justified his recent betrayal of Kurds (he effectively condoned the Turkish attack on the Kurdish enclave in northern Syria) by noting that \u201cKurds are no angels\u201d. Of course, since, for him, the only angels in that region are Israel (especially on the West Bank) and Saudi Arabia (especially in Yemen). However, in some senses, the Kurds ARE the only angels in that part of the world.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

More recently, for years, Turkey has played a well-planned military-political game, officially fighting Isis but effectively bombing Kurds who are really fighting Isis.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In northern Syria, the Kurdish enclave centered in Rojava was a unique place in today\u2019s geopolitical mess: when Kurds were given a respite from their big neighbors who otherwise threatened them all the time, they quickly built a society that one cannot but designate as an actually-existing and well-functioning utopia.\n\nFrom my own professional interest, I noticed the thriving intellectual community in Rojava where they repeatedly invited me to give lectures \u2013 these plans were brutally interrupted by military tensions in the area.\n\nBut what especially saddened me was the reaction of some of my \u201cLeftist\u201d colleagues who were bothered by the fact that Kurds also had to rely on the US military protection.\n\nWhat should they have done, caught in the tensions between Turkey, Syrian civil war, the Iraqi mess and Iran? Did they have any other choice? Should they sacrifice themselves on the altar of anti-imperialist solidarity?\n\nThis \u201cLeftist\u201d critical distance was no less disgusting than the same distance towards Macedonia. A couple of months ago, the discussion was around how to resolve the problem of the name \u201cMacedonia\u201d.\n\nThe solution proposed was to change the name to \u201cNorth Macedonia,\u201d but this was instantly attacked by radicals in both countries. Greek opponents insisted that \u201cMacedonia\u201d is an old Greek name, and Macedonian opponents felt humiliated by being reduced to a \u201cNorthern\u201d province since they are the only people who call themselves \u201cMacedonians.\u201d\n\nImperfect as it was, this solution offered a glimpse of an end to a long and meaningless struggle with a reasonable compromise. But it was caught in another \u201ccontradiction\u201d: the struggle between big powers (the US and EU on the one side, Russia on the other).\n\nThe West put pressure on both sides to accept the compromise so that Macedonia could quickly join the EU and NATO, while, for exactly the same reason (seeing in it the danger of its loss of influence in the Balkans), Russia opposed it, supporting rabid conservative nationalist forces in both countries.\n\nSo which side should we take here? I think we should decidedly take the side of the compromise, for the simple reason that it is the only realist solution to the problem \u2013 Russia opposed it simply because of its geopolitical interests, without offering another solution, so supporting Russia here would have meant sacrificing the reasonable solution of the singular problem of Macedonian and Greek relations to international geopolitical interests. (Now that France has vetoed the fast-track inclusion of North Macedonia into the EU, will they be responsible for an unpredictable catastrophe in that part of Balkans?) Will the Kurds be dealt the same blow from our anti-imperialist \u201cLeftists\u201d?\n\nThat\u2019s why it is our duty to fully support the resistance of the Kurds to the Turkish invasion, and to rigorously denounce the dirty games Western powers play with them.\n\nWhile the sovereign states around them are gradually sinking into a new barbarism, Kurds are the only glimmer of hope. And it\u2019s not only about Kurds that this struggle is fought, it\u2019s about ourselves, it\u2019s about what kind of global new order is emerging.\n\nIf Kurds will be abandoned, it will be a new order in which there will be no place for the most precious part of the European legacy of emancipation. If Europe turns its eyes away from the Kurds, it will betray itself. The Europe which betrays Kurds will be the true Europastan!", "description": "Well over a hundred years ago, Karl May wrote a bestseller, Through Wild Kurdistan, about the adventures of a German hero, Kara Ben Nemsi.
