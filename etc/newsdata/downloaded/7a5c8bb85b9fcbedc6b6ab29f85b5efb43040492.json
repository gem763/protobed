Ted Cruz this week \u2014 along with the Lone Star state as a whole \u2014 for contributing to the city\u2019s gun crimes.\n\nThe Democrat was none too thrilled with Mr. Cruz on Monday for pointing out the impotency of Chicago\u2019s gun control efforts, and she let him know it with a direct order: \u201cKeep our name out of your mouth.\u201d\n\nAt issue was Mr. Cruz\u2019s assertion on Twitter that \u201cstopping violent criminals\u2014 prosecuting & getting them off the street \u2014 BEFORE they commit more violent crimes is the most effective way to reduce murder rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cGun control doesn\u2019t work. Look at Chicago. Disarming law-abiding citizens isn\u2019t the answer,\u201d the Republican tweeted while sharing a story about 25 individuals shot in Chicago during the first half of Labor Day weekend.\n\nMr. Cruz\u2019s commentary, for all intents and purposes, echoed that of Chicago\u2019s leading police Superintendent Eddie Johnson in June.\n\n\u201cWe know who a lot of these people are. And how do we know that? Because we keep arresting them over and over and over and over and over again,\u201d Mr. Johnson said after a weekend in which 52 people were shot. \u201cIt\u2019s just a vicious cycle. So until we hold violent offenders accountable in the way that they should be, we\u2019re going to continue to see this.\u201d\n\nMs. Lightfoot, however, blamed \u201ccoward Republicans\u201d from out of state for not enacting Chicago-style gun laws.\n\n\u201c60% of illegal firearms recovered in Chicago come from outside IL \u2014 mostly from states dominated by coward Republicans like you who refuse to enact common sense gun legislation,\u201d the Democrat tweeted. \u201cKeep our name out of your mouth.\u201d\n\nHer rejoinder included statistics showing the origin of guns confiscated after Chicago crimes.\n\nOver 60% of guns came from Illinois (40.4%), and Indiana (21%), while 1.8% of Chicago\u2019s guns came from Texas.\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times reported 43 people shot \u2014 eight fatally \u2014 by the end of the holiday weekend.\n\n60% of illegal firearms recovered in Chicago come from outside IL\u2014mostly from states dominated by coward Republicans like you who refuse to enact commonsense gun legislation.
