They're being very careful what they say and how they position themselves.\"\n\nThe NBA controversy began after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey sent a now-deleted tweet over the weekend in support of the anti-government protests in Hong Kong, sparking a backlash from Chinese state media.\n\nThe NBA could now lose billions as Chinese partners cut or suspend ties with the league.\n\nCNBC reported earlier Thursday that NBA players' unusual quietness on China may stem from the private advice they are getting from sports agents to tread lightly or avoid discussing the issue entirely.\n\nMashburn, a former All-Star who retired in 2006, shared similar remarks, speaking on players thinking about life after they leave the basketball court for good.\n\n\"They really understand there's a really huge market in China for basketball fans,\" Mashburn said.\n\nHe continued: \"At the end of the day, you're going to have to go through China, India and emerging markets in also Africa as well.\"\n\nMashburn said players could eventually speak out once they process the political issue a bit or get more direction from Adam Silver, the commissioner of the NBA.\n\nMashburn has built a sizable business portfolio, with stakes in more than 100 restaurants and car dealerships across the country, according to the Dallas Morning News.\n\nOn Thursday Mashburn announced he is becoming an advisor to the board of Revolution Global, a Chicago-based cannabis company, joining a growing list of former professional athletes who have aligned with the burgeoning industry.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Kevin Stankiewicz contributed to this report.", "description": "NBA players understand the economic consequences of speaking out on political issues, former All-Star Jamal Mashburn tells CNBC.", "authors": ["Berkeley Lovelace Jr.", "In Berkeleylovelace", "Jabari Young"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106169434-1570519848064gettyimages-1173564439.jpeg?v=1570744994", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
