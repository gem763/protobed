Photo: David Walter Banks for The Wall Street Journal\n\nBruce Meyer, 77, the founding chairman of the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, on his Shelby Cobra CSX2001, as told to A.J. Baime.\n\nNearly 15 years ago, I went to a car show called R\u00e9tromobile, which happens in Paris every winter. I happened to be there the day before the show opened, wandering around, when I saw this striking vehicle. A Swiss dealer had it on display. I asked about the history of the car and he said, \u201cThis is CSX2001.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way. It can\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nThe dealer showed me all the documentation that proved it. The serial number CSX2001 signified that it was the first production Shelby Cobra ever built. This was the automotive find of a lifetime, and I bought the car instantly, for a high-six figure price. In the 1960s, This Car Caused a Sensation Steve McQueen was among the celebrities who bought a Shelby Cobra, built by racing icon Carroll Shelby.

David Walter Banks for The Wall Street Journal The story of the Cobra goes back to the early 1960s. Carroll Shelby was a race-car driver who retired due to heart problems. He had this idea to use an American engine (in this case, a Ford) to build a new kind of what he called \u201csport car.\u201d He used a chassis from a British company called AC, and he gathered a team of hot rodders to build the first Cobra. At the time, he didn\u2019t even have his own production facility. Shelby\u2019s dream was to build his own car that could beat the Corvettes and Ferraris on the race track. When he finished the first car\u2014CSX2000, a prototype\u2014he repainted it numerous colors and gave it to magazines for photography, making it appear that he was actually building these cars. After the prototype, he built the first \u201ccustomer\u201d car (CSX2001). The car was then shipped to France, to race. By 1965, the Shelby Cobra was a sensation\u2014winning races and respect all over the world, and luring a lineup of celebrity customers. I bought my first in 1965, and I got to know Shelby personally. [He died in 2012, at the age of 89.] The first production Cobra, meanwhile, spent most of its life in France, until I found it by accident at the R\u00e9tromobile car show. I have owned it ever since, and I restored it with racing #1, because it is the first production Cobra, and also because it raced with #1 in the sixties. Today, I have more Porsches than any other kind of car, including two that won the 24 Hours of Le Mans. But I love the Cobra. It is rowdy. It is spirited. It checks every box in terms of turning on all the senses. I have spent my life pursuing automotive passions, and finding this car is the automotive highlight of my life. Write to A.J.
