Of those firms, nine in 10 see Singapore as the best option -- beating any other destination in Southeast Asia or elsewhere.\n\nSome 80% of respondents said the protests have impacted their future investment decisions regarding Hong Kong.\n\nThe Chamber conducted the poll from Aug. 21-29 across 120 companies with regional head offices mainly in Singapore. Almost two thirds of the firms had an office in Hong Kong. While the survey represents a modest sampling of businesses in the two financial centers, the data shed light on corporate sentiment around a sensitive issue.\n\nThere\u2019s no indication that Hong Kong\u2019s turmoil will end soon, even as the city\u2019s Chief Executive Carrie Lam last week gave in on one of the protesters\u2019 demands by scrapping the extradition bill that initially drew people onto the streets three months ago.\n\nIn the meantime, Singapore officials have been reluctant to celebrate any wins on the sidelines. Minister for Trade & Industry Chan Chun Sing warned Sept. 2 that \u201ccontinued disruptions to Hong Kong\u2019s stability will have negative spillover impact on Singapore and the region given these close linkages\u201d in trade and investment.\n\nFirms in the survey appear more optimistic. Among those considering relocation out of the territory, 86% said Singapore will reap gains, while almost two-thirds of those staying put agreed.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Michelle Jamrisko in Singapore at mjamrisko@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nasreen Seria at nseria@bloomberg.net, Chris Bourke\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Almost a quarter of businesses in a new survey are thinking of leaving Hong Kong to escape ongoing protests, with most looking to Singapore as their favored location.Some 23% of surveyed companies with an office in Hong Kong are considering moving business functions from the city, while", "authors": ["Michelle Jamrisko"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bEoUBfSZ4AKt0bBMKX8CrQ--~B/aD03ODA7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/fbb14891aced7a83bd5ec6e4d76f51ea", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
