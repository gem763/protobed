No longer are these economies the most important in the world. Italy, Canada, even Germany and France, have drifted into socialist zombie land, unable to grow or realize their potential. When you include the intentional cultural suicide of Canada and Western Europe, which has destroyed the security of the average citizen by importing millions of North African migrants who have no intention of following laws, respecting Western culture, religion or women, the group becomes even more of a shell of its former self. In short, Western Europe is slowly dying.\n\nSo why would you need a meeting of its leaders to decide global policy and enhance security? It\u2019s like the English monarch issuing a statement of global affairs; it just doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\n\nNow that we have decided the G-7 is irrelevant, what about Russia and Vladimir Putin? Where does Mother Russia fit into these global shindigs?\n\nThere is a reason for the leaders of important countries to meet, that reason is world peace. Talking is not bad; it is good. Therefore, leaders should not be kicked out of such meetings over disagreements; that is how wars are started.\n\nI am not saying nations should not face unified consequences for behavior; I believe in the concept. However, I do not believe that ending communication should be a part of that process. We are all adults and should act as such, even if we vehemently disagree.\n\nRussia is geographically the largest country in the world. The Russian empire has a long history that deserves respect and inclusion in world affairs. The Western media has had a field day for the last few years demonizing Russia due to a made-up campaign to depose a duly-elected president of the United States.\n\nRussia is an adversary, not necessarily an enemy. Talking to the Kremlin and cooperating where we can will pay dividends for world peace and security.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union acted in malign ways, we still talked to them, as the consequences were too great not to.\n\nThe same situation exists today. The world is much more unstable and dangerous than during the Cold War, when the two superpowers simply stared at each other and played within certain rules.\n\nTerrorism and weapons of mass destruction are a deadly combination.\n\nI do not know whether Russia should be invited to the G-7, or if it should even exist at all. Frankly, I think it was just an idea by President Trump to start further discussions with Moscow. The venue really does not matter.\n\nWe are on the verge of another great conflict in the Middle East, between Sunni and Shia, between proxies of Moscow and the United States, between terrorism and stability, between freedom and religious totalitarianism.\n\nThe Iranian threat is real and the Trump administration is right to put Iran at the top of the list when it comes to deploying resources and using geopolitical capital.\n\nRussia can aid in solving this possible hot war in a region already devastated by decades of conflict.\n\nWe have written about the possibility of a deal in the works between Moscow and Washington. Russia wants sanctions removed; Washington wants help dealing with the mullahs and reducing their footprint of terror armies in the Middle East.\n\nTalking with the Kremlin in this set of circumstances makes even more sense than before.\n\nAmerica is tired of war. We need to spend money and human capital on our own country, rebuild our infrastructure, refill our financial coffers; in short, American needs to become great again. That will be a big job after the diabolical sedition of the Obama administration.\n\nIf we can talk with Russia and help avoid another conflagration in the Middle East, so be it.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
