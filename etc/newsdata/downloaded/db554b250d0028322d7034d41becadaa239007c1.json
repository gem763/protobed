Blumel immediately declared that \u201csomething has broken in our country\u201d and called for a nationwide dialogue to heal the deep divisions.\n\nFinance minister Felipe Larrain was replaced by Ignacio Briones, an economics professor.\n\n\u201cThese have been very difficult days. We have lived between pain and hope,\u201d said Pi\u00f1era, whose approval ratings are nearing single digits. \u201cChile changed and the government also has to change to confront these new times and new challenges.\u201d\n\nHundreds shot and beaten as Chile takes to the streets Read more\n\nBut after more than a week of often violent unrest over economic inequality, few expected that the reshuffle would end the upheaval: even as the president spoke, fumes from tear gas rolled into courtyards of the presidential palace, as protesters outside called for Pi\u00f1era to resign.\n\n\u201cMore than a change of faces, we need a change of politics. The government ought to proceed with an ambitious social agenda that takes charge of the citizen\u2019s demands,\u201d said Alvaro Elizalde, president of the Socialist party.\n\nFresh demonstrations have already been called for Tuesday, but in addition to public fury, Pi\u00f1era now faces efforts by opposition lawmakers to charge him for violating the constitution and permitting human rights violations during the street protests which have left least 17 dead, and led to the arrest of more than 7,000 people.\n\nOn Monday, Pi\u00f1era deplored the loss of lives and welcomed the arrival of a UN human rights team to Chile. \u201cWe have nothing to hide,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new interior minister Blumel repeatedly welcomed human rights investigations, and also reached out to the hundreds of thousands of immigrants recently settled in Chile \u2013 in dramatic contrast from the hardline authoritarian rhetoric of his predecessor Chadwick.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Demonstrators react as fire rages during an anti-government protest in Santiago.

Human rights groups on Monday demonstrated outside the supreme court and demanded stricter limits to the crowd control tactics used by security forces which thus far have led to more than 1,000 Chileans injured and more than 100 partially blinded after being shot in the eye.\n\nHeraldo Munoz, president of the progressive PPD party called on the new interior minister to investigate abuse allegations. \u201cWe hope to see an openness and real changes, not just staged scenes with applause,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an open letter published on Monday, 150 Chilean law professors condemned serious human rights violations across the country.\n\n\u201cWe demand that the right of protesters be respected,\u201d said the letter, which called for \u201can active and responsible dialogue, in good faith, to create pathways to solutions\u201d.\n\nPolice commanders have noted that hundreds of police officers were also injured \u2013 including those burned by Molotov cocktails thrown by protesters. Outnumbered officers have been unable to stop mass looting and vandalism which has left more than 100 supermarkets in ruins, alongside numerous subway stations, pharmacies and banks.\n\nAn explosion of protest, a howl of rage \u2013 but not a Latin American spring Read more\n\nDespite the widespread fury with Pi\u00f1era, Chile\u2019s progressive opposition has failed to harvest political capital from the crisis, said Pablo Zeballos, founder of iTask consulting, a Latin American risk analysis firm with headquarters in Chile\n\n\u201cFor the people who are marching, the entire political class from right to left is guilty. They are seen as the ones with all the privileges. Thus, they are invalid,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for the government will be to maintain \u2018normalcy\u2019 in the next few days, to advance with a new social contract and a political solution,\u201d said Zeballos. \u201cThese massive marches create a unification of those who feel rejected and the time to find a political solution is closing.\u201d", "description": "Fresh upheaval erupts shortly after president Sebast\u00edan Pi\u00f1era announces firing of hardline officials", "authors": ["Jonathan Franklin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49d4853f19880062c75a318f6403e44e4692520c/0_0_3442_2066/master/3442.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7a5a2e804ec8a1ca1353a4135c2ef294", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
