They were helped by higher sales of crop protection chemicals, seeds and consumer healthcare products.", "description": "Bayer says number of glyphosate plaintiffs jumps to 42,700", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9T0C9_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
