A whistleblower's complaint released this week alleges the White House tried to \"lock down\" Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's new president because officials were worried about Trump's request for help investigating Trump's Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe anonymous whistleblower alleges the White House also tried to cover up the content of other calls by moving memos onto a highly classified computer system.\n\nThe former White House official acknowledged that other calls were concealed, while casting the decision as part of an effort to minimize leaks, not an attempt to hide improper discussions. The former official was not authorized to discuss the classification system publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe White House was beset by leaks of highly sensitive information in the early days of Trump's presidency. Trump was particularly enraged by leaks that disclosed tough conversations with the leader of Mexico on paying for a border wall and with Australia on abiding by an Obama administration deal on asylum seekers.\n\nAfter those disclosures, a White House adviser raised the possibility of lie detector tests for the small number of people in the West Wing and elsewhere with access to transcripts of Trump's phone calls.\n\nIn previous administrations, rough transcripts of presidential phone calls were kept private, but not housed on the highly classified computer system unless sensitive national security information was discussed. Summaries of the calls were distributed to relevant officials in the White House, the State Department and other agencies.\n\nThe Trump administration's process curtailed the number of people who had access. The question is now why.\n\nThe whistleblower's complaint paints a picture of a White House scrambling to conceal damaging information about the president, including the July call in which he pressed Ukraine's leader for help investigating Biden.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get more serious than this. It is a betrayal of his oath of office for President Trump to pressure a foreign country to interfere in our elections. And yet that is exactly what <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@realDonaldTrump</a> did. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TruthExposed?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TruthExposed</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/MnB5ARJR35\">pic.twitter.com/MnB5ARJR35</a> \u2014@SpeakerPelosi\n\nThe White House released a rough transcript of the call this past week in which Trump repeatedly says Attorney General William Barr and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani could help with that effort.\n\nThe call came days after Trump ordered a freeze to some military assistance for Ukraine.\n\nThe contents of the restricted calls with Putin and bin Salman are unknown. But Trump's relationship with both leaders has been controversial, given Russia's attack on the 2016 U.S. election supporting Trump's bid for the presidency and Saudi Arabia's human rights violations, including the murder of a Washington Post journalist.\n\nThe relationship between U.S. President Donald Trump, right, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, shown here at the G20 summit in Japan in June, has been controversial, especially Russia's role in his election campaign.
