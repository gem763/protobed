That showed a drop in the US manufacturing gauge to 2009 levels.\n\n\"The ISM was a disaster. There's negativity around the US economy and a stronger case for the Fed to cut in October,\" Mr Callow said.\n\nWith heightened expectations for Fed easing, the Australian central bank \"does not want to be the odd one out on interest rates,\" asserted Mr Callow. The Australian dollar recovered to US67.1\u00a2 against the US dollar on Wednesday.\n\nOther options\n\nBut as interest rates head to zero, the Reserve Bank will need to consider other options to support the economy. Any unconventional measures will probably focus on bond-buying, said Mr Attrill. \"It depends on what amount of outstanding stock they have to buy.\"\n\nThat should in turn depress the currency, said Mr Callow. \"By buying bonds you are flattening the yield curve and lower yields should make your currency less attractive.\n\n\"Theoretically, money is being created so the supply of Australian dollars increases. All other things being equal, increased supply means the price should fall.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the US was at the height of QE, the Australian dollar was above parity with the US dollar.\n\nMr Callow said that while unconventional policy was the only real option for the central bank if it couldn't achieve its mandate with the cash rate alone, the Reserve Bank would not be rushed into anything.\n\n\"It's untested in Australia and it's a bit of a sign of desperation,\" he concluded.", "description": "The Reserve Bank got the currency reaction it wanted after its third rate cut this year, sending the Australian dollar to a 10-year low.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5132733f0289264be3527218a9dae1eb9e61becd", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
