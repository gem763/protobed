He has hit the hour-mark with a healthy 11 seconds to spare. The projected finish time is currently 1:59:48. A reminder: The sport's governing body, the IAAF, will not recognise the run as an official record because it is not in open competition and it uses in and out pacemakers. Kipchoge, 34, the reigning Olympic champion who set an official world record of 2:01.39 at the Berlin marathon in September last year, missed out by 26 seconds when he previously attempted to break the two-hour barrier in Monza in May 2017, a race run without spectators. Watch the above video as Eliud Kipchoge attempts to make history.\n\nPreview:\n\nWho is Kipchoge?\n\nKipchoge is perhaps the best candidate in the world to attempt such a historic achievement in breaking the two-hour barrier for the marathon.\n\nA four-time champion of the London marathon, having won the last two editions, as well as a two-time winner in Berlin and a solitary victory in Chicago to go with his Olympic gold medal.\n\nWhat is the 1:59 challenge?\n\nIneos have sponsored the event, which will take place around the 4.3km stretch on the Prater Hauptallee in Vienna, Austria, with 4.4 laps required to complete the marathon distance.\n\nElevation will remain comfortably flat, though it will fluctuate between 1.8 and 4.0 metres. One request of Kipchoge since Nike Breaking2 was to involve fans, meaning the route will be lined by spectators in order to provide him with support.", "description": "Eliud Kipchoge aims to break the two-hour barrier in the marathon today as part of the INEOS 1:59 Challenge.
