Most banks have been beaten down for more than a year since the collapse of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. and defaults by other shadow lenders including Dewan and Altico Capital India Ltd.\n\nShares of IndusInd have fallen more than 20% over the past week amid speculation that it was owed money by Indiabulls. As of Sept. 29, gross exposure to the housing finance company concerned, its units and associate finance companies stands at about 0.35% of the loan book and is backed by adequate collateral, IndusInd said in a Sept. 30 filing without naming any firm.\n\nConcerns over exposure to the troubled companies have also dragged another lender Yes Bank Ltd. shares by 81% in the past year, prompting the bank to lodge a complaint with the police on the dissemination of fake news and rumors about its financial health on social media platforms.\n\nIndusInd\u2019s gross bad loan ratio stands at about 2.2% as of June end, compared with more than 9% for the nation\u2019s banking system. Its return on assets rose to 2.1% in June from 1.9% in the year-ago period, filings show.\n\nIL&FS group is seeking to resolve most of its debt obligations by March, chief operating officer of the company said this month. Meanwhile, Dewan, the largest mortgage lender to default so far, has prepared a plan to resolve stress on its books. IndusInd, which has exposures to Dewan, IL&FS and Indiabulls, has seen repayments from some embattled borrowers in the September quarter, Sobti said, without providing further details.\n\n\u201cThe elephant has passed through, though the tail is still wagging,\u201d Sobti said. \u201cAs far as most of the big risks to the system are concerned, whether from non-bank financing companies or real estate, we have turned the corner.\u201d\n\n(Updates with shares in fifth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Divya Patil.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Suvashree Ghosh in Mumbai at sghosh186@bloomberg.net;Anto Antony in Mumbai at aantony1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Marcus Wright at mwright115@bloomberg.net, Jeanette Rodrigues, Arijit Ghosh\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- IndusInd Bank Ltd., which saw a fifth of its market value wiped out over the past week on concern about its creditors, says the crisis of confidence engulfing India\u2019s financial system is fading away.Outstanding loans to overstretched borrowers dipped at the Mumbai-based bank last quarter", "authors": ["Suvashree Ghosh", "Anto Antony"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2CTB610u4RU9zgqpZ9L8YA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/8b002ea63a398417388e6c4f46551693", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
