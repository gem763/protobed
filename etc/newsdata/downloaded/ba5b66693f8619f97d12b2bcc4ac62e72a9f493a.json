A pillar of the country\u2019s once-mighty defence industry, the company recorded a 1.76 billion rand loss in 2018.\n\nDenel has not yet released financial results for the 2018/19 fiscal year, but was projected to be insolvent, according to a presentation to parliament\u2019s portfolio committee on public enterprises on Wednesday.\n\nIt expects to raise 160 million rand in the third quarter of the 2019/20 financial year via the disposal of equity in Hensoldt Optronics, a producer of high-tech optics such as sensors and radars, in which it owns a 30 percent stake. The fiscal year runs from April 1 to March 31 with an October-to-December third quarter.\n\nDenel CEO Danie du Toit said any deals were subject to government approval but negotiations over Hensoldt were in progress.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on plan,\u201d he wrote in a text message on Friday.\n\nExiting its loss making LMT, an armoured vehicle business in which it holds a 51% stake, and its small calibre ammunition unit PMP should save it 70 million rand in the same quarter.\n\nEquity sales and partnerships involving core businesses like Denel Land Systems, missile unit Denel Dynamics and Denel Aeronautics should help raise another 4.4 billion rand through 2022.\n\nStreamlining supply chains, reducing staff costs and exiting other businesses, including Denel Aerostructures, could reap 862 million rand in further savings.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Denel said it foresaw some 30 billion rand in deals over the next two years, including the largest export contract in the company\u2019s history.\n\nDenel has not publicly named the customer. But the presentation to parliament says the contract, which includes a 1.5 billion rand advance, focused on Egypt\u2019s navy and ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems vessels.\n\n($1 = 14.7759 rand)", "description": "South Africa's struggling state-owned defence company Denel aims to begin disposing of equity stakes and exiting loss-making businesses within months as part of its turnaround strategy, it told a parliamentary committee.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426911240&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8516J-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
