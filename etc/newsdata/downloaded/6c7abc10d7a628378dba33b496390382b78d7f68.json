Lucien Favre's Borussia Dortmund play the way United fans expect of their team.\"\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOf Pochettino, he added: \"I am not convinced he is a ready-made Manchester United manager.\"\n\nSolskjaer's Manchester United lost 1-0 to Newcastle at St James' Park on Sunday, but it was the manner of the defeat that upset fans.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nThe team looked devoid of ideas and managed just three shots on target against the relegation-threatened Magpies.\n\nSolskjaer apologised to supporters after the defeat, saying: \"We have given ourselves a very, very tough task to get into top four, let alone the top six, and we need results straight away.\n\n(Image: PETER POWELL/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\"We're unhappy with the results and results bring out the mood of everyone.\n\n\"I've got to say sorry to the fans that we're not winning games, but that's down to a rebuild and this is not a similar situation to Everton last year when I felt people had given up. These boys give everything for the shirt.\n\n(Image: ARMANDO BABANI/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\"Luckily for us it's now the international break. We get time to evaluate what's gone on over these eight games.\n\n\"We will sit down, hopefully we'll get a few players back. It's my responsibility. I need to sort their heads out.
