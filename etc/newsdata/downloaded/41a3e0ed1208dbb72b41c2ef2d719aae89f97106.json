Some muscles.\u2019\n\nThor\u2019s position is safe (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nRuns in the family.\n\nWhen it came to Liam, Chris mused: \u2018Liam we could make\u2026we could change him to Captain Australia, maybe?\n\n\u2018No? I don\u2019t know.\u2019\n\nStill, there is no way Chris is going to bring his brothers in to replace the OG Avengers as he said: \u2018I love my brothers, but I love that cast.\u2019\n\nLiam also auditioned for the role of Thor back in the day (Picture: @chrishemsworth)\n\nPerhaps he can put the good word in Kevin Feige\u2019s ear about some spots in the upcoming Phase Four of the MCU, eh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan we have a little lol about the fact Chris kept Liam far away from taking over his role of Thor, after the actor admitted his little brother also auditioned for the role back in the day.\n\nAnd originally got further!\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nPreviously speaking to W Magazine, Chris explained: \u2018I came into the audition with Kenneth Branagh and thought I nailed it and then never heard anything back. Months went by and then my brother, my little brother, Liam, was in Australia and sent a tape across and he got a call back, then another call back and then was down to the last kind of four or five people for it.\n\n\u2018I remember sitting in Vancouver, shooting Cabin in the Woods with Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon. Both of them were looking at the trades at this sort of top five guys for Thor and saying, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in the mix here? What happened?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I blew my audition I guess.\u201d\u2019\n\nAfter none of those guys got it, Chris continued: \u2018My manager then called up and said, \u201cYou know, he\u2019s got an older brother. Can we bring him back in?\u201d So I did an audition in Vancouver in this hotel room with my mum reading Anthony Hopkins\u2019 part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She must have nailed it because it got me back in the room and that second audition was a lot different than my first one. I came in kind of with a little, I guess, motivation and maybe frustration that my little brother had gotten further than me.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a little family, sibling rivalry sort of kicked up in me. Then it moved pretty quick from there. It was cool.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
