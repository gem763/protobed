The View\u2019s Whoopi Goldberg was among those who accused Messing of echoing Joseph McCarthy\u2019s Hollywood blacklist of the 1950s. \u201cThe last time people did this, people ended up killing themselves,\u201d Goldberg said this week.\n\nTrump claimed that Messing is \u201calso being accused of being a Racist because of the terrible things she said about blacks and mental illness,\u201d Trump added, a claim Kimmel called \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Roseanne Barr\u2026 said what she did, even being on a much higher rated show, she would have been thrown off television,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cWill Fake News NBC allow a McCarthy style Racist to continue? ABC fired Roseanne. Watch the double standard!\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the way she was thrown off television,\u201d Kimmel said of Barr. \u201cNot \u2018would\u2019ve\u2019\u2014was.\u201d\n\nThe host said Trump \u201cdoes have a point\u201d when it comes to racists on TV. \u201cThis is America,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean the only racist who should be allowed to have a TV show is him, really. He\u2019s the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember when Donald Trump vowed to take out ISIS?\u201d Kimmel asked. \u201cI guess that didn\u2019t happen. So instead, he\u2019s going after Will & Grace.\u201d", "description": "The late-night host is utterly fascinated by the president\u2019s bizarre fixation on the \u2018Will & Grace\u2019 star.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1426,w_2535,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567743729/JK_3_kl8m1f", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
