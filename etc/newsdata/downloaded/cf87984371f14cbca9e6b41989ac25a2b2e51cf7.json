Why this fair isle jumper is turning heads\n\nName: Suggestive fair isle.\n\nAge: New for winter 2019/20.\n\nAppearance: Warm, festive, highly suggestive.\n\nSuggestive of Scottish winter skies and cosy nights by the fire? Among other things, yes.\n\nBut it\u2019s a jumper, yeah? \u201cFair isle\u201d refers to a type of knitwear pattern - named after the island in Shetland \u2013 which, in its traditional form, has a restricted palette of four or five colours.\n\nAs I said, a jumper. These days, of course, you can get some quite startling variations on the characteristic design, including this \u00a356 Felicity Fairisle sweater from the retailer FatFace.\n\nHas it got a reindeer wearing sunglasses on it? No, it\u2019s an abstract pattern, although many people see something else in it.\n\nSuch as? Breasts.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty normal with jumpers, but you are not meant to stare. We are not talking about the wearer. As a number of Mumsnet users have noticed, the design across the front of the jumper is easily mistaken for a long row of breasts.\n\nI\u2019m no anatomist, but don\u2019t rows of breasts normally consist of a maximum of two? On people yes, but here it\u2019s more like a continuous string of mammary bunting.\n\nI have got a very strange image in my head. Put it on a jumper, and you\u2019re there.\n\nOh my God! It\u2019s some kind of monstrous many-breasted sweater! Those who have seen it agree it cannot easily be unseen.\n\nYou would think the island crofters who knit these things would notice the problem before they got three breasts across. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s how it\u2019s done nowadays.\n\nI wonder if many other people have noticed. So far, comments below the item on the FatFace website are exclusively about the resemblance. \u201cNothing I like more than images of melons on my melons!\u201d wrote MelonGunsGuns.\n\nSo people are being quite grown up about this. Absolutely. \u201cThe pattern looks exactly like a row of boobs!\u201d wrote another commenter. \u201cMulti-boob bunting across your own boobs!\u201d\n\nTitter titter. That\u2019s what she said!\n\nSomebody worked hard on that design, and now it\u2019s ruined. \u201cBIT OF A BOOB\u201d writes one online shopper, Titania.\n\nThat\u2019s enough \u2013 the fun\u2019s over, people. The fun ended a while ago, but the people are just getting started. \u201cNORKTASTIC!\u201d adds Multinorks of Nork Park.\n\nDo say: \u201cOh, well. At least I know what to get Uncle Phil for Christmas.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for something more formal, we also do a lovely ball gown.\u201d", "description": "Shoppers have spotted an image that \u2018cannot be unseen\u2019 in the design of this FatFace sweater \u2013 much to their amusement", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0507d215ba7257ef1a1376b1260e7ce8ad6fbc85/0_275_5785_3471/master/5785.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0357d19398eff8e098c4cd893cad51b1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
