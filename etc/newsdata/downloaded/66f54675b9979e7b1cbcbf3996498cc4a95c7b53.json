Turn dark mode on your phone to try it out.\u201d\n\nAnnoyingly, there isn\u2019t currently a way to toggle the feature on and off within Instagram\u2019s settings, and instead, users have to opt for a system-wide dark mode to access the feature within Instagram.\n\nHow to get dark mode on Instagram\n\nTo try the feature for yourself, make sure you\u2019ve updated to the latest operating system - Android 10 or iOS 13.\n\niPhone\n\n1.
