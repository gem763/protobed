As the sole breadwinner there is no shame in that", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019m often taken aback at how comfortable some people are to talk about money and ask directly how much you earn.\n\nI\u2019m more likely to ask someone what kind of porn they like to watch then stick my nose into their financial affairs. (Type that into Pornhub\u2019s search engine, I bet you\u2019ll find it\u2019s somebody\u2019s kink.)\n\nIt\u2019s happened to me though, many times at social occasions.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cSo, how much do you make from your \u2018comedy\u2019?\u201d\n\nI have been asked from the very start of my career, 20 years ago. Three Live At The Apollo\u2019s 10 tours and two books later, there will still be a slightly baffled friend of a friend asking me this at a party after a few drinks. (Incidentally, the quotation marks around \u201ccomedian\u201d are indicative of their tone of voice. I don\u2019t mean they write the question down on a piece of paper and pass it to me over the potato salad, though I wish they would.)\n\nMany people seem slightly baffled that you can make a living from jokes and other creative endeavours, especially if they have never heard of you, which, tragically, happens a lot in my case.\n\nOver the years I have lost count of the number of times someone I barely know asks me how much I earn, how much my house was or what my book advance was. These people, over the years have, without exception, all been men.\n\nI point this out not to have a go at men. I\u2019m more interested in why women don\u2019t ask. Are we more polite? Or have we been raised to believe that business, the making of money, the managing of it, is mostly a man\u2019s job? I have found it incredibly difficult over the years to talk about money and negotiate. A crucial life skill if you are self-employed.\n\nIn my family, I am the sole breadwinner. The other two members of my family are 12 and six years old and thanks to The Man, they are not permitted to get work and keep ME in spotty pyjamas and Jaffa cakes. It\u2019s all down to me.\n\nSometimes, and by that I mean, frequently, I find the responsibility overwhelming and wonder if I was wrong, all those years ago, for judging Cinderella for marrying a prince. Of course, in the fairy-tale, she married him for love but, let\u2019s face it, the whole \u201cin love\u2019\u201d thing had a lot to do with his money and position. If he\u2019d been the bloke at a house party who brought along half a bottle Lambrusco he\u2019d found at the back of his fridge, Cinderella would have Uber\u2019ed herself a pumpkin out of there.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not judging. I have done much worse things for money than get married to a man I just met who has a foot fetish. I went on I\u2019m A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! for God\u2019s sake, and I don\u2019t mind at all telling you how much I got paid for it. I got paid over a year\u2019s worth of bedtimes with my children which was worth spending two weeks sitting on a log with complete strangers who said, \u201cIt is what it is\u201d, a lot.\n\nI did Celebrity Masterchef for the money. You get more the longer you stay in. I was pregnant, single, and I knew that if I got to the second round, I\u2019d have made enough for a short maternity leave. I made it through, got my maternity leave money, then made a sandwich and got booted off.\n\nAs someone who occasionally finds bank statements in her knicker drawer, I find managing money difficult. I don\u2019t open letters in brown envelopes. It causes me anxiety. I\u2019m a shambles.\n\nThis is the one subject I never talk with my friends about.\n\nWe talk about everything, my women friends and I. Love, affairs, love affairs, politics, haemorrhoids... few conversations are as varied and open as when female friends are catching up over almond croissants. But money, how we make it, when we worry about it, is rarely brought up as a chat. We are mindful perhaps, for all we know, that our friend is in a financial pickle and doesn\u2019t want to hear our money worries.\n\nWe have been taught that money is too personal, too rude, too gauche. Refreshingly, I have met young female comedians recently who are more open about being business savvy in this job. Being more open, we give each other a bigger idea of what is out there. If you don\u2019t ask, you don\u2019t get, as they say.\n\nWhy do we find it harder to ask those direct money questions than some men? If they are mothers, women do the lion\u2019s share of the childcare, so does that affect the way we see ourselves in business? That our career is an aside, not to be taken as seriously as a man\u2019s? Who knows. Most of the time, like so many other self-employed people, I\u2019m so busy hustling, I don\u2019t have time to think about whether I\u2019m doing it all as effectively as I could be.\n\nMy general M.O is to stick work out there and hope for the best. In this spirit, I hope it\u2019s not too pushy or forward to remind readers of this column that my two-week run of my show \u201cSkittish Warrior, Confessions of a Club Comic\u201d starts at the Soho Theatre on 17 September. Will you come? Like I say, if you don\u2019t ask, you don\u2019t get.
