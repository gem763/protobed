It could have been my son,\" O'Neal O'Neal told WXIA reporter Francesca Amiker. \"It could've been your cousin and she was living in a one-bedroom house with her two boys so we found her a one-bedroom house in College Park. Nice area. I'm going to get her some ring cameras on me. We're going to give her some furniture, TVs and pay her rent off for a year and help her get on her feet.\"\n\nRoby Lynch, the CEO of Papa John's, and Jeff Smith, the chairman of the board of Papa John's, are also helping O'Neal get this new house up and running for the family.
