Authorities said 22 people were killed and a further 38 wounded.\n\nThe explosions came after Donald Trump abruptly ended talks with the Taliban earlier this month over a deal that would have allowed the US to begin withdrawing troops from its longest war.\n\nIn a statement sent to media claiming responsibility for both blasts, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the attack near Ghani\u2019s rally was deliberately aimed at disrupting elections scheduled for 28 September. \u201cWe already warned people not to attend election rallies, if they suffer any losses that is their own responsibility,\u201d the statement said.\n\nGhani, who was speaking to his supporters at the time of the explosion, was unhurt but later condemned the attack, saying the incident proved the Taliban had no real interest in reconciliation. \u201cAs the Taliban continue their crimes, they once again prove that they are not interested in peace and stability in Afghanistan,\u201d Ghani said.\n\nIn Kabul, 60km (40 miles) away, shopkeeper Rahimullah said he had been sitting inside his shop in the capital at the time of the secondexplosion. \u201cThe wave broke all the windows,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cI rushed outside and saw several bodies just across the street. This is the second time in less than a month that a blast has broken our windows. I just fixed them a week ago.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump's cancelled Taliban talks are typical of a president who blows hot and cold Read more\n\nThe UN\u2019s mission in Afghanistan accused the Taliban of showing \u201cdespicable disregard for civilian life and fundamental human right to participate in democratic process\u201d.\n\nIn the elections, Ghani will face off against his chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, and more than a dozen other candidates, including men who have been warlords,spies or members of the country\u2019s former communist regime.\n\nFor weeks, the election have been sidelined by the US-Taliban talks, with many Afghans and observers expecting the vote to be cancelled if a deal was agreed. Candidates have done little in the way of campaigning. But with the deal off, Ghani and his rivals have begun the race.\n\nGhani is seeking a clear mandate to negotiate with the insurgents on a lasting peace in Afghanistan.\n\nTrump\u2019s declaration that the US-Taliban talks were \u201cdead\u201d spurred the insurgents to declare last week that the only other option was more fighting.", "description": "Explosions at election rally and in central Kabul follow collapse of US-Taliban peace talks", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Kabul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87352a1f02346203913f304e6d72c681e72ea691/0_127_2368_1420/master/2368.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bdbcd874d3e171d206128375512efae4", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
