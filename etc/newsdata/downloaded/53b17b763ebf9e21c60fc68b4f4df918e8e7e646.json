Changpeng Zhao, the CEO and Founder of leading crypto exchange, Binance, has voiced his approval of the new endorsement.\n\nPremier League Team First to Wear Sportsbet, BTC Logos\n\nWatford will wear the Bitcoin logo on their team jerseys as part of the sponsorship from Sportsbet.io. The logo itself did more for the club and the betting startup than any other form of advertising \u2013 while also giving exposure to Bitcoin in an impromptu mass marketing campaign.\n\n\u201cThe crypto community have been hugely supportive of us since we began, so putting the Bitcoin logo on the sleeve felt like a fun way to give something back while also showing them our support,\u201d said Justin Le Brocque, Head of Marketing at Sportsbet.io.\n\nSportsbet is the first crypto-related company whose name and logo appears on a Premier League club jerseys. The Watford team will give its Premier League fame to the leading coin at a time when BTC prices are outpacing any other digital coin in both trading and yearly gains.\n\nBinance\u2019s Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao Impressed with Marketing Move\n\nSportsbet\u2019s latest move attracted the attention of Binance\u2019s head poncho. \u201cCZ\u201d, as he is known in crypto communities, is also a proponent for crypto adoption.\n\nSmart move for Sportsbet. If they used their own logo, I wouldn't be retweeting for them.$BTC, just amazing how far a coin could go without a marketing team.

Sportsbet itself explained the decision to put up the logo as a thank-you to crypto supporters that used its service.\n\nFor the fans, Sportsbet is also giving away a signed Bitcoin logo jersey:\n\nWe also give away a SIGNED #Bitcoin Sleeve shirt + 5*2m\u20bf Free Bet! \ud83d\udd8b How to win\n\n\ud83e\udd1d Follow @Sportsbetio on Twitter\n\n\ud83d\udd01 Retweet this post & the sleeve announcement post \ud83e\udd471st prize \u2013 Signed #WatfordFC Shirt\n\n\ud83e\udd482nd-5th prize \u2013 2m\u20bf Free Bet on https://t.co/kI3TBVdgsK#Sportsbetio pic.twitter.com/R8XK1yd8z3 \u2014 Sportsbet.io (@Sportsbetio) September 12, 2019\n\nSportsbet\u2019s move resembles previous publicity stunts, although those were specifically intended by crypto supporters. Back in 2014, the Dogecoin community bought advertising and branded a Nascar vehicle.\n\nBitcoin had less luck \u2013 in the summer of 2018, the crypto community attempted to buy a featured ad on the Super Bowl half-time. Unfortunately, the NFL moved in to ban Bitcoin from being presented on one of the world\u2019s most viewed advertising slots.\n\nCrypto advertising is still a contentious topic. Because of the unfiltered advertising on the Internet, some projects managed to reach a wider audience, eventually leading to large-scale scamming. But Bitcoin has never led an advertising campaign, except for occasional flashes of the logo. Being featured during a football club\u2019s games is sure to give a boost to its visibility.\n\nWhat do you think about Sportsbet\u2019s move?
