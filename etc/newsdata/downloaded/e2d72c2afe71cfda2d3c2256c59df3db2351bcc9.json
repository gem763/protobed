They kick, they do some play in the middle. They are really structured and that for me is really good. I improved a lot [during by time in England].\n\n\u201cI think sometimes it\u2019s boring but it\u2019s good for England, and it works. Next Saturday is going to be like a war, it\u2019s like a final for us. Maybe my play in Worcester helped to see the way it will come on Saturday.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In my opinion I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very justified. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just trying to rattle us a bit. He\u2019s more than welcome to try.\u201d\n\nAttack coach Scott Wisemantel concurred with George, and having overseen England\u2019s improvement with the ball in hand since their 2018 barren run, the Australian fired off a few shots of his own.\n\n\u201cHe might just have been at a boring club, I don\u2019t really know,\u201d said Wisemantel. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is the case and he obviously hasn\u2019t been watching much of the Premiership. There are some excellent teams in the Premiership with so many different styles. And it is a bit like me making a judgement call on the Jaguares they are very different.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s varied and can be very structured at times but you have to remember in this tournament a third of our tries have come from unstructured play. I don\u2019t necessarily agree (with Creevy).\u201d\n\nThe 34-year-old Creevy remains a pivotal and inspirational figure in the Argentina set-up, despite losing the captaincy when Mario Ledesma was brought in from Australia to resurrect the side after their post-2015 World Cup slump under predecessor Daniel Hourcade.\n\nOne particular concern for Argentina was the fact that their scrum \u2013 forever considered one of the strongest in the game \u2013 had become something of a weakness in the Rugby Championship. But by installing Ledesma in charge and learning from the errors of their ways this summer, the pack looks to be heading back towards rediscovering that set-piece dominance.\n\nIt is also an area of strength for England, which should ensure Saturday\u2019s encounter produces fireworks up front as both packs look to dominate the opponent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really hard with the forwards. The scrum, the maul, the lineout, it\u2019s going to be good,\u201d Creevy added. \u201cI think the battle with the forwards will be the game. We need to win the scrum, win the lineout, win the maul, win the contact, the breakdown.\n\n\u201cWe trained a lot. Our skills in the scrums and the mentality, we worked a lot in that. I think we are improving a lot in the scrum and we feel good, but we need to continue. The England scrum is really good.\n\n\u201cWhen we put on this shirt we feel something different. It\u2019s our country, our family, my club. We play together, the group is really bonded. That is different to different teams. We love each other, and I think that is different to other teams. We are friends, we are brothers, inside and outside the field.\u201d\n\nCreevy is set to return to the starting line-up after watching deputy Julian Montoya score a 26-minute hat-trick against Tonga last weekend, and should he do so, he will become the most-capped rugby player in Argentinian history, overtaking the current record that he shares with former Leinster out-half Felipe Contepomi.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m really proud. I can\u2019t explain with words, and in English it\u2019s really difficult. I\u2019m really proud to get 88 games with this shirt. I never imagined that, it\u2019s a dream for me.\n\n\u201cI think about my club, family, a lot of things I did and that was hard. Now I think about it and say it was really great.\u201d", "description": "England\u00a0have hit back at Argentina hooker Agustin Creevy after the talismanic Puma accused them of relying on a \u201cboring\u201d style ahead of their Rugby World Cup \u201cwar\u201d this weekend.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/06/owen-farrell.jpg"}
