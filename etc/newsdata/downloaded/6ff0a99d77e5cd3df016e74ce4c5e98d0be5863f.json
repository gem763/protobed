T stock held most of those gains Sept. 10 after Elliott Management issued a letter claiming the company\u2019s problems can be fixed.\n\nThere's No Way AT&T Stock Is the Best Streaming Bet More\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis letter, published on the activating at&t site, is mainly word salad. It suggests that AT&T stop buying other companies, focus on operations and commit to giving more money back to shareholders. In a press release accompanying the full letter, Elliott Management claims that if AT&T follows the outlined plan it could see a 65% upside to the T stock price by the end of 2021.\n\nHowever, the letter doesn\u2019t address the serious structural problems I pointed to July 1. AT&T remains a yield trap, burdened by both enormous financial and technology debt as well as assets that are depreciating faster than the company can capitalize on them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere\u2019s the AT&T Stock Problem\n\nLet me illustrate this with a customer example. I\u2019ll use myself, Dana Blankenhorn.\n\nI have been sending AT&T as much as $450 per month for a combination of cable, internet and wireless services. But my family can do better.\n\nGoogle Fi, from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), would cost us $140 per month for the same wireless service I get from AT&T \u2014 a savings of about $70 per month. Google Fi is an mobile virtual network operator. Instead of owning its own wireless infrastructure, Alphabet runs Google Fi through several \u201cborrowed\u201d networks. These include European networks, meaning that when my family travels we get to keep our phone numbers.\n\nAlphabet launched Google Fi after failing to gain traction with Google Fiber, which I had installed behind my house a few years ago. Google decided it would cost more to connect me to that wired service than it could generate in cash flow from phone service, TV and fast internet.\n\nThat\u2019s the rest of my AT&T bill. Ruh-roh.\n\nWhy am I paying $150 per month for cable services I don\u2019t watch when I could buy a collection of streaming services that replicate the same plan? I only watch TV a few hours a day \u2014 mainly sports. ESPN+ carries most games for $5 per month. Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video is free if you find its two-day, free shipping worth $10 per month. Disney\u2019s (NYSE:DIS) Disney+ is set to launch under $10 per month.\n\nThat leaves the internet bit. That\u2019s under $100 per month for plenty of bandwidth to handle my work \u2014 and those TV streams. AT&T cash flow is about to take a hit.\n\nThe AT&T Confusion\n\nSince buying Time Warner and rebranding it as WarnerMedia, AT&T has been trying to nickel-and-dime everyone it can to pay down the $159 billion in debt it had at the end of June.\n\nMy cable plan has already lost the NFL Network. Now AT&T is fighting over fees with ESPN, its most popular service. Its streaming bundle, now called AT&T TV, is priced at $93 per month, making it completely uncompetitive.\n\nAT&T is killing the U-Verse brand. It made WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey the new president and chief operating officer, and he\u2019s now heir-apparent to AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson. In July Stankey was at WarnerMedia\u2019s helm as AT&T cut ad sales staff.\n\nThe Bottom Line on T Stock\n\nAT&T\u2019s \u201coriginal sin\u201d was its failure to invest in the cloud and instead move into programming. It bought DirecTv for $49 billion and, later, Time Warner for $84 billion more.\n\nMeanwhile, wired infrastructure inherited from its days as the Bell System has become worthless, now replaced by its own wireless operation. Shuffling the deck chairs, as Elliott proposes, and pushing more money onto shareholders may boost the stock price, temporarily.\n\nBut Elliott Management\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t even propose to solve AT&T\u2019s real problem: its technology debt.\n\nAT&T\u2019s market cap today of $272 billion is barely half that of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Facebook is the smallest of the five \u201cCloud Czars.\u201d It was founded in 2004. Google was founded in 1998. Its market cap is over $835 billion.", "description": "Shares of AT&T (NYSE:T) rose 5% Sept. 9.
