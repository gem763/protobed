Nixon\u2019s staff called the House Judiciary Committee a \u201ckangaroo court \u201d and charged that it had violated the president\u2019s due process. On the day of President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment, one of my colleagues said that \u201cnothing about this process has been fair.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 1998, we felt under siege. From the moment that independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr delivered his report to Congress in a convoy of SUVs, we knew Clinton would not receive a fair hearing. A relentless barrage of leaks from Congress and severe partisan attacks on the president followed.\n\nWe argued at the time, as you do in your letter, that Congress should provide additional procedural protections to the president. Although the House Judiciary Committee afforded us some measures, we still thought they were wholly inadequate. For example, instead of conducting its own investigation, the committee relied almost exclusively on Starr\u2019s report, which had serious flaws. The House took only three months to adopt articles of impeachment, and we had only two days to present our witnesses. The president\u2019s personal attorney, David Kendall, had only 30 minutes to question Starr. We felt this was deeply unfair and a derogation of the House\u2019s constitutional duty to investigate thoroughly whether impeachment was warranted.\n\nBut we never considered the possibility of refusing entirely to participate in the impeachment inquiry or completely blocking the House\u2019s access to documents and witnesses. We understood that, regardless of how partisan the impeachment process was, we had the moral, ethical and legal obligation to operate within the bounds of our constitutional system.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Constitution grants the \u201csole Power of Impeachment\u201d to the House of Representatives. Confronted with an exercise of that power, the White House, of course, can and should push for procedural fairness. It is not enough, however, simply to assert, as you have, that the impeachment inquiry is \u201cinvalid \u201d and therefore that the president has no choice but to refuse to participate.\n\nA total refusal to respect our constitutional system is without precedent. The founders understood, as Alexander Hamilton wrote , that impeachment, by its nature, \u201cwill seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused.\u201d Nevertheless, the White House cannot reject Congress\u2019s authority on the mere grounds that it believes the House of Representatives seeks to \u201creverse\u201d a past election and \u201cinfluence\u201d a future one.\n\nIf President Trump\u2019s White House bears any resemblance to Nixon\u2019s or Clinton\u2019s, I assume you feel unfairly attacked. Nixon\u2019s speechwriter, Pat Buchanan, accused \u201cthe big media\u201d of distorting coverage of Nixon during his impeachment process, and we felt that Clinton was subjected to numerous unwarranted attacks. That said, we recognized that Congress\u2019s motives for initiating an impeachment inquiry had no bearing on its constitutional authority to do so. We also understood that we had an independent and solemn responsibility to do our part to preserve our system of checks and balances by participating in the impeachment process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou are not representing just any client. As White House counsel, you have a responsibility to serve the Office of the President, not the president himself. Your letter unfortunately conveys a different understanding.\n\nYou should object and make cogent legal arguments to resist what you perceive as congressional overreach. Indeed, we fought hard at times to ensure a degree of fairness to the proceedings, and I advise you to do the same. Be zealous in your advocacy. That\u2019s expected and appropriate. But you do not have a right merely to will Congress\u2019s authority away. It\u2019s wrong to try, and it won\u2019t work.\n\nMoreover, such an ill-conceived and extra-constitutional strategy could cause lasting damage to the presidency and to the ability of the branches of government to function the way our founders envisioned. Of particular note, it could also inflict collateral damage on our justice system more generally, sending the message that subpoenas can be disregarded at will.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe White House counsel should convey respect for our constitutional system, not disregard for it, and defend the presidency without seeming to reject wholesale our constitutional system of checks and balances. I have confidence that our system is stronger than any one person, and you should, too.\n\nMy best,\n\nLanny\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The Trump White House can call the impeachment inquiry partisan, but it still has a legal obligation to let the process move forward.", "authors": ["Lanny A.
