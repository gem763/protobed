But Badziag noticed that entrepreneurs who had started e-commerce businesses after him were able to grow faster and surpass his success.\n\nTo figure out why some entrepreneurs end up as millionaires, but others surge ahead to become billionaires, Badziag decided to ask the billionaires directly. It took about six years, but eventually he spoke in person with 20 individuals across the globe who had made at least $1 billion, gleaning insights to the personal traits that made them so successful. As Badziag describes it, he wanted \u201cto dissect their minds, their hearts, their souls.\u201d\n\nUncredited\n\nThe resulting book he wrote, The Billion Dollar Secret, doesn\u2019t offer one single insight to success but instead 20 principles he found in common with all of them\u2014from Chip Wilson, the Canadian founder of Lululemon Athletica, to Lirio Albino Parisotto, the Brazilian founder, president and main shareholder of Videolar-Innova S.A.\n\nBadziag, who puts his age at 40-something, spoke with Penta about the process of compiling the book, and what he learned.\n\nPENTA : So what\u2019s the billion-dollar secret?\n\nBADZIAG: Billionaires are people from different countries, regions, religions, cultures, industries, age groups. They are different personalities, but they have certain things in common that make them so successful in business. I analyzed these commonalities and identified 20.\n\nFor example, billionaires are action-oriented, even without a guarantee of success. Most people avoid risks, avoid failures. Billionaires say, I would rather regret a mistake or a failure than regret not taking a chance in my life. Others think and then decide to act, while billionaires have already acted. Jack Cowin (founder of Competitive Foods Australia) always says, \u2018Don\u2019t wait for your ship to come in\u2014row out to meet it.\u2019\n\nThis is about resourcefulness, about being able to act with whatever you have at the moment.\n\nAnother principle is to be engaged in constant improvement in life and in business. [Billionaires] always want to learn something new, to improve their business, to improve themselves. Most people consider they are done with education when they get their degree. But billionaires, they want to improve all the time\u2014not through formal education, but mostly self-driven, by reading, by experimenting.\n\nAn example is Tony Tan Caktiong \u2014he built the largest restaurant group in Asia (Jollibee Foods, based in the Philippines). Even though he\u2019s a billionaire, and considered one of the top entrepreneurs, every year he goes to Harvard Business School for a one-week executive program to improve in one aspect of business or financial management. Even today, he considers that he doesn't know enough. There\u2019s still room for improvement.\n\nHow did you select the billionaires to interview?\n\nI wanted to learn from the best entrepreneurs about how to think and act in business. First, they needed to have a net worth of at least $1 billion. Second, they had to be self-made. You can see the difference between the first and second generations of wealth. The first generation had to build from scratch\u2014it\u2019s a completely different skill from somebody who was born into wealth.\n\nThird, I wanted people to be role models. One aim of the book was to show it\u2019s possible to become extremely wealthy while preserving personal integrity and upholding ethical values.\n\nFor example trust is a necessity, or a precondition, for a long-term business relationship, and in order to keep trust, with your customers, with your business partners, you have to act ethically to earn that trust, to hold that trust.\n\nFourth: philanthropy. A significant percentage of billionaires, especially self-made billionaires, develop vast philanthropic activities. I\u2019m not talking about going to charity balls, and sending money [to organizations] to look good; these people build huge philanthropic organizations.\n\nHow did you get them to talk to you?\n\nYou have to realize how improbable my project was when I set out. Apparently I employed some of the billionaire principles. Despite the extremely low probability of success, and the knowledge that it could fail, [I said], if I don\u2019t try, I will never be successful.\n\nPeople who are extremely successful in their industries, who have created great value and wealth, with time, they have to be philanthropic on the one hand, and on the other hand, they want to share the wisdom they have learned in their life. The knowledge or experiences they have accumulated\u2014they have the ambition to pass this to the next generation of entrepreneurs, and to improve the quality of entrepreneurship in the world. My mission aligns with their mission.\n\nHow has your billionaire research influenced your own business so far?\n\nI didn't change anything tangible. [But] I started to think globally, started to do big things...of course, this [book] project is a big thing...but since then, I started developing projects on a global scale, that have a much bigger impact on society, on improving people's lives, improving the world (Badziag founded the nonprofit Billionaires for Good last May.) I\u2019m not afraid of taking a chance, and spending several years of my life investing in something that may not work out.
