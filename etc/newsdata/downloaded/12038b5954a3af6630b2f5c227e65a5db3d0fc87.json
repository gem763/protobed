Rand Paul (R-KY) on Tuesday applauded President Trump\u2019s decision to move about 50 American soldiers in northern Syria away from a frontline in a pending war between Turkey and Syrian Kurdish forces.\n\n\u201cIt reminds me of President Reagan\u2019s decision after the bombing in Beirut that having a few hundred soldiers in the middle of the war, they\u2019re not necessarily a deterrent but often a tripwire to a larger conflagration and so I really think the president is making a wise decision,\u201d he told reporters on a conference call.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m of the opinion go big or go home and there\u2019s no reason to be putting a couple dozen soldiers in the middle of oncoming armies,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I think the president\u2019s made a wise decision, and I for one am very supportive of it.\u201d\n\nHe slammed Republicans criticizing the president over his decision as neoconservatives who \u201cnever met a war they didn\u2019t like.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are the people who never met a war they didn\u2019t like. Never met a war they wanted to end, never met a war they once declared victory from. And so no it doesn\u2019t surprise me. But I guess the onus is on those people to explain what the national interest is in Syria for us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll these same people who wanted to stay were advocates for getting into the middle of this Syrian civil war. They were all advocates for toppling Gaddhafi, they were all advocates for toppling Hussein, they\u2019ve been wrong about everything in foreign policy for the last several decades,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve gotten us involved in quagmire after quagmire, extraordinarily expensive, I agree with the president that the expense in both blood and treasure is disproportionate, something I think most Americans would actually agree with president that this is not a war that our national interest is at stake.\u201d\n\nA senior National Security Council official told reporters on Tuesday that the American troops, which number about 50 in northern Syria, would be redeployed elsewhere in Syria, contrary to reports suggesting that Trump with withdrawing all U.S. troops there.\n\nDuring the height of the U.S.-led war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), there were about 2,000 U.S. forces in Syria. The administration has pushed to reduce that to a presence of about 400.\n\nPaul said the backlash over moving 50 troops within Syria shoes the \u201clunacy\u201d of the war caucus\u2019 criticism.\n\n\u201cThis goes to the lunacy of the war caucus yelling and screaming over moving 50 soldiers. For Goodness sake\u2019s they want to lose 50 in the wake of a 600,000 person Turkish Army. Who are these armchair generals?\u201d he said.\n\nPaul argued the approximately 50 forces are not a deterrent \u201cto anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of different scattered special forces in those areas, but we have no deterrent to anybody\u2026it\u2019s not like we have a big army there to deter Turkey from coming in,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said the U.S. could not be responsible for all the refugees that would result from a Turkish offensive or refugees who are currently residing in Turkey.\n\n\u201cIf we were to deter Turkey from coming in, who\u2019s going to be responsible for all those refugees? There\u2019s like three million refugees \u2014 are we going to be responsible for them forever? The president makes a good point on the captured ISIS fighters and families \u2014 are we going to house 90,000 people until the end of time?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen are the Europeans going to step up and do anything? When are they locally going to do something? The Turks have at least stood up and said they\u2019re going to do something about it, so I think the president\u2019s made the right decision and anybody advocating, telling the president or demanding that the president leave 50 troops in place is somebody who really hasn\u2019t thought through the consequences,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul also slammed Democrats who have are for foreign policy restraint but are not backing up the president on his decision. Even the supposedly anti-war, ultra-progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) criticized Trump for moving the 50 U.S. troops from northern Syria.\n\nPaul chalked it up to \u201cTrump Derangement Syndrome\u201d:\n\nI think that why you hear such a uniform racket going after the president is the Democrats go after the president because of Trump derangement syndrome. They don\u2019t like him politically, and we\u2019re in the middle of a continuous campaign. And so there are Democrats who probably do think it was ill-advised to be in the middle of the Syrian civil war but they\u2019ve gone quiet or dormant since their preoccupation is more with expressing their displeasure for Trump.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans are actually more predictable in the sense that the neo-con hawks in our party really, like I said, never met a war they didn\u2019t like,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Rand Paul applauded President Trump's decision to move about 50 American soldiers in northern Syria away from a frontline.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/07/rand-paul-trump-thumbs-up-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
