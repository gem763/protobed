It\u2019s populists.", "language": "en", "text": "European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen is focused on the wrong threat.\n\nThe unveiling of her new roster of top civil servants this week contained more than a few surprises. Beyond a handful of new names and reshuffling of old hands, she has rejigged and renamed responsibilities in a way that could have serious ripple effects.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to make fun of the confusing array of buzzwords dreamed up by the Commission\u2019s communications team. And on the surface, the creation of a portfolio for the \u201cProtection of our European Way of Life\u201d seems a bit gauche, but innocuous enough.\n\nRead between the lines, however, and it prompts some awkward questions: What do we mean by \u201cour way of life\u201d? Why is it under threat, and from whom?\n\nVon der Leyen\u2019s answer to these questions, in the job description attached to the portfolio, is deeply misguided.\n\nThe new Commission chief should give free rein to her rule of law enforcers to tackle rule of law breaches with a firm hand.\n\nThe mission letter attached to the new brief calls for its head\u2014 Vice-President Margaritis Schinas \u2014 to \u201caddress and allay legitimate fears and concerns about the impact of irregular migration on our economy and society.\u201d The not-so-subtle suggestion is that our \u201cway of life\u201d is being threatened by people seeking asylum, or simply seeking a better life, in Europe.\n\nAnd yet, the real threat to Europe\u2019s values comes from elsewhere.\n\nNational governments within the EU\u2019s borders are chipping away at women\u2019s rights, LGBTI rights, freedom of the press and the independence of the judiciary. They want to replace democracy, diversity and the rule of law with \u201ctraditional values\u201d and \u201cilliberal\u201d democracy.\n\nTo be sure, von der Leyen has put in place a strong team to deal with justice and the rule of law. But she also has undermined this fight by adopting populist language and a xenophobic view of migration championed by anti-immigrant governments. Her choice of words will be noted by government critics, women, LGBTI people and minority groups across Europe who have seen the effects of this kind of euphemistic language.\n\nThe European Parliament, when it convenes to vote on von der Leyen\u2019s new Commission, should dispute her choice of words and correct this cosmetic wrong.\n\nPushback from MEPs will send an important signal. Language matters. And yet, it won\u2019t be enough to address the underlying problem.\n\nVon der Leyen\u2019s misstep shows the Commission is still in the pocket of EU member countries. Not only did governments go against the treaties and appoint vice presidents as part of their top jobs deal, they have also taken unofficial ownership of portfolios.\n\nIn the end, action will speak louder than words. Yes, von der Leyen has to ditch the silly portfolio with the embarrassing name. But she also needs to roll up her sleeves and face down the actual threat to our \u201cway of life.\u201d\n\nThe new Commission chief should give free rein to her rule of law enforcers \u2014 Vera Jourov\u00e1, vice president for values and transparency, and Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders \u2014 to tackle rule of law breaches with a firm hand and defend democracy and fundamental rights.\n\nThe Commission can\u2019t stay neutral and technocratic when it comes to these values. Von der Leyen will have to take sides when rights and freedoms are violated. She should speak out against bans on abortion, anti-gay propaganda law, constraints on academic freedom, government attacks on judges and critics, and discrimination of all kinds.\n\nInstead of devising creative new job titles, the Commission should focus on its core tasks. Protect the treaties. Stay independent of member states. Uphold European values. And, maybe most urgently, drop the buzzwords and communicate honestly with citizens.\n\nSophie in\u2019t Veld is a Dutch MEP from the Democraten 66 party, part of the Renew Europe group in the European Parliament.", "description": "Real danger to EU comes from \u2018illiberal\u2019 national governments.", "authors": ["Sophie In", "T Veld", "David M.
