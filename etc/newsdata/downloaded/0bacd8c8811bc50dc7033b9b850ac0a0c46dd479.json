In particular, Schweizer, who helms the Government Accountability Institute, noted that the former vice president\u2019s youngest son, Hunter, profited off deals with Ukraine and China that were inaccessible to the average American businessman.\n\nInstead of refuting Schweizer\u2019s argument, Bedingfield\u2019s letter attacked the Times for having published the opinion piece in the first place. The deputy campaign manger even went to the extent of accusing the paper of not having \u201cinternalized the sobering lessons of 2016\u201d by giving \u201ctop billing\u201d to a \u201cright-wing polemicist.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut today\u2019s decision is hardly the first example,\u201d Bedingfield wrote, before proceeding to claim the Times had an \u201coutsized hand in the spread of a baseless conspiracy theory\u201d concerning the Biden family. \u201cWhat was especially troubling about the Times\u2019s active participation in this smear campaign is that prior to its reporting\u2026 this conspiracy had been relegated to the likes of Breitbart, Russian propaganda, and another conspiracy theorist, regular Hannity guest John Solomon.\u201d\n\nThe campaign\u2019s line of attack, although unsurprising given their frequent broadsides against the media, comes as Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings have spilled into the open amid the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. At the center of the inquiry is a conversation the president had with the Ukrainian government suggesting they probe how the younger Biden secured an appointment to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden was appointed to the oil and gas giant\u2019s board, a position which paid as much as $83,000 per month, in 2014, around the same time his father was made the Obama administration\u2019s point man on Ukraine.\n\nBreitbart News has followed that story, along with Hunter Biden\u2019s ties to a private equity firm bankrolled by the Chinese government, since Schweizer published his bestselling book \u2014 Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends.", "description": "Joe Biden's campaign is furious NYT\u00a0is covering how the former vice president's political interests converged with his son's business dealings.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/biden-point-upshot-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
