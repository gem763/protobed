He does a lot of movement but that doesn\u2019t faze me.\u2019\n\nOleksandr Usyk hasn\u2019t fought since beating Tony Bellew at cruiserweight since last November (Picture: Getty)\n\nResponding to Wilder\u2019s barbs, Usyk said: \u2018I really don\u2019t care what he\u2019s saying. Actually, I like that he\u2019s talking about me because it means I\u2019m already into his head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a champion and knows what it takes. I like that he\u2019s thinking about me.\u2019\n\nBellew, meanwhile, who lasted eight rounds against Usyk, believes the 32-year-old would represent a significant threat to Wilder, but would struggle against both Joshua and Fury.\n\nAsked which heavyweight Usyk would stand a chance of beating, Bellew said: \u2018Wilder, and that\u2019s an easy answer. Don\u2019t get me wrong, if Wilder lands on him then it\u2019s not going to end well for Usyk, but you can say that about any heavyweight who Wilder lands on.\n\n\u2018I just think [Joshua and Tyson Fury] are too big for him. Fundamentally, he\u2019s a much better boxer than all of them, and I include Fury in that, but he\u2019s just too small to compete with them for 12 rounds. I think the size of Fury and Joshua would be a massive advantage and I don\u2019t think Usyk could overcome it.\n\n\u2018If he was to fight Andy Ruiz tomorrow, then I think he\u2019d win that fight by just being himself and doing what he does best. There are only a few guys I don\u2019t see him winning against, but he\u2019s by far the most skilled fighter in the division and that will always give him a chance.\u2019\n\nMORE: Triple H drags away Braun Strowman as Tyson Fury announces WWE match in Saudi Arabia\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Eddie Hearn praises Tyson Fury\u2019s WWE appearance but can\u2019t see Anthony Joshua following suit", "description": "Oleksandr Usyk believes he is already living in Deontay Wilder's head ahead of his eagerly anticipated heavyweight debut.
