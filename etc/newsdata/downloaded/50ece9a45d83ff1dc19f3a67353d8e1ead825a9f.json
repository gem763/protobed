The decision has divided rugby fans across the World but both Brian and Bob agree with the punishment and think it will lead to more sensible tackles moving forward.\n\nDespite the win, Brian is still not convinced we've seen the best of Eddie Jones' side just yet. Former World Cup winner Mike Tindall joins the show and gives us his take on how England should line up for their final pool match with France.\n\nAs for France, they laboured to a narrow win over Tonga and have guaranteed their place in the quarter-finals. Ahead of their pool decider with England there have been rumours of a rift between captain Guilhem Guirado and the senior coaching staff. One man who knows what it's like to coach France at a World Cup is Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9, he joins the show and explains why the French are more of a 4x4 than a Formula One car at present.", "description": "With the Pool stages of the 2019 Rugby World Cup drawing to a close, and the quarter-finals starting to take shape, Brian Moore is joined in the studio by former Springbok captain and World Cup winner Bob Skinstad to analyse which teams are likely to top their pool and ensure a safer route to the latter stages of the tournament.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/I_I_C1CLXDo/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
