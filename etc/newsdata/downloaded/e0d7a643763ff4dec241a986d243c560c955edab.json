We are devastated,\u201d the owners said in a Facebook message, adding that all staff at the winery \u2014 located in the town of Healdsburg, 70 miles north of San Francisco \u2014 are safe.\n\nAt least two hospitals in Santa Rosa evacuated patients over the weekend to other facilities.\n\nThe Kincade Fire \u2014 the most devastating in California this year \u2014 ignited Wednesday and spread quickly thanks to powerful gusts of up to 90 miles (145 kilometers) per hour.\n\n\u201cOver 3,000 people are working on the fire as we speak, making sure the evacuation is going smoothly and people are taking it seriously,\u201d said state governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nAn estimated 180,000 people were under mandatory evacuation orders, including in parts of Santa Rosa and a large swath of Sonoma County all the way to the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Largest evacuation in memory\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cThis is the largest evacuation that any of us at the Sheriff\u2019s Office can remember. Take care of each other,\u201d the Sonoma County sheriff\u2019s office tweeted.\n\nAuthorities said the area would remain under dangerous red flag conditions until Monday morning.\n\n\u201cThings will improve as we head into Monday and Tuesday but we need to be resilient,\u201d a spokesman for the National Weather Service told a news conference.\n\nA fire official warned that should the flames continue spreading west and jump over a major freeway \u2014 the 101 \u2014 that could prove even more catastrophic, as that region hasn\u2019t had any fires since the 1940s.\n\n\u201cThe fuels in that area are extremely dense, they are extremely old and decadent, and they are extremely dry,\u201d he said, referring to the combustible materials including shrubs and trees feeding the fire.\n\nMore than 3,000 firefighters backed by air tankers and helicopters were battling to control the blaze, which was not expected to be contained before November 7, fire officials said.\n\n\u2013 Police to prevent looting \u2013\n\nSonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick told a news conference that hundreds of police officers backed by the National Guard had been deployed in regions under evacuation orders to check property and prevent looting.\n\nSeveral other fires have erupted throughout the state in the last week, fueled by high winds, bone-dry conditions and temperatures in the 80s and 90s Fahrenheit (26-32 Celsius).\n\nOne major fire \u2014 the Tick Fire \u2014 in the southern part of the state, north of Los Angeles, also prompted evacuations and destroyed a number of homes near Santa Clarita.\n\nBut on Sunday, most evacuation orders were lifted as some 1,000 firefighters worked to contain the fire that burned more than 4,500 acres.\n\nIn a bid to reduce the risk of fire, California\u2019s largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., said it expected to turn off power to nearly one million customers across northern and central California.\n\n\u201cWinds of this magnitude pose a higher risk of damage and sparks on the electric system and rapid wildfire spread,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe fire risk is even higher because vegetation on the ground has been dried out by recent wind events.\u201d\n\nPG&E has come under intense scrutiny after it emerged that one of its transmission lines may have played a role in the Kincade Fire.\n\nThe same type of line was responsible for California\u2019s deadliest-ever wildfire \u2014 last year\u2019s Camp Fire, which killed 86 people.\n\nPG&E, which filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year, has been blamed for several other fires in the state in recent years.\n\nNewsom hit out at the utility earlier this week, saying he was infuriated that a state such as California \u2014 which boasts the fifth-largest economy in the world \u2014 had to endure blackouts.", "description": "Healdsburg (United States) (AFP) \u2013 California\u2019s governor declared a statewide emergency on Sunday as a huge blaze, fanned by strong winds,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/e29b35_firefighter-walks-burned-property-kincade-tore-healdsburg-california-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
