It is at Groom Lake, a dry lake bed in the Nevada Desert, 85 miles (135km) north of Las Vegas.\n\nWhat goes on inside is extremely secret. Members of the public are kept away by warning signs, electronic surveillance and armed guards.\n\nIt is also illegal to fly over Area 51, although the site is now visible on satellite images. The base has runways up to 12,000ft (2.3 miles/3.7km) long.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Some local businesses in the small town of Rachel have embraced Area 51's association with alien mythology\n\nThe facility is next to two other restricted military areas: the Nevada Test Site, where US nuclear weapons were tested from the 1950s to the 1990s, and the Nevada Test and Training Range.\n\nThe entire range covers more than 2.9 million acres of land.\n\nAccording to the US military, it represents \"a flexible, realistic and multidimensional battle-space to conduct testing tactics development, and advanced training\".\n\nWhy was it built?\n\nArea 51 was created during the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union as a testing and development facility for aircraft, including the U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance planes.\n\nAlthough it opened in 1955, its existence was only officially acknowledged by the CIA in August 2013.\n\nFour months after the CIA's disclosure, President Obama became the first US president to mention Area 51 publicly.\n\nImage caption Rachel and Hiko are the two closest towns to the Area 51 base\n\nWhat goes on there today?\n\nAlthough official information is sparse, it is believed that the US military continues to use Area 51 to develop cutting-edge aircraft. About 1,500 people are believed to work there, many commuting on charter flights from Las Vegas.\n\nAnnie Jacobsen, who has written about the history of Area 51, told the BBC that some of the world's most advanced espionage programmes are at the site.\n\n\"Area 51 is a test and training facility. The research began with the U-2 spy plane in the 1950s and has now moved on to drones\", she says.\n\nAre there aliens and flying saucers at Area 51?\n\nThe secrecy surrounding Area 51 has helped fuel many conspiracy theories.\n\nMost famous is the claim that the site hosts an alien spacecraft and the bodies of its pilots, after they crashed at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The US government says there were no aliens and the crashed craft was a weather balloon.\n\nOthers claim to have seen UFOs above or near the site, while some say they have been abducted by aliens, and even experimented on, before being returned to Earth.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Area 51 has featured in a number of sci-fi shows, such as the X-Files\n\nAnd, in 1989, a man named Robert Lazar claimed he had worked on alien technology inside Area 51. He claimed to have seen medical photographs of aliens and that the government used the facility to examine UFOs.\n\nArea 51's association with aliens may have served as a useful distraction for the intelligence agencies.\n\n\"As early as 1950 the CIA developed a UFO office to deal with the sightings of unidentified flying objects over Nevada. When people first saw the U-2 spy plane flying, no one knew what they were seeing,\" says Ms Jacobsen.\n\n\"The CIA used that disinformation to their benefit by fostering an alien mythology.\"\n\nGetty Area 51 in numbers 1955 Year facility opened\n\n2013 Year its existence was first officially acknowledged\n\n2.3 miles Length of longest runway\n\n1,500 Number of people who are thought to work at the facility Source: BBC\n\nWhat happens if people 'storm' Area 51\n\nMatty Roberts, 20, created a Facebook event proposing that \"we can run faster than their bullets. Let's see them aliens\". Two million people said they were \"going\", although a linked festival has since been moved because of fears of a \"possible humanitarian disaster\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The F-117 Stealth fighter made its maiden flight from Area 51 in 1981\n\nWarning signs around Area 51 make it clear that no trespassers will be tolerated.\n\nThe USAF warned that Area 51 \"is an open training range for the US Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces\".\n\nIt added: \"The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets.\"", "description": "The secret Nevada base, known as Area 51, is often the subject of alien conspiracy theories.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/BF9F/production/_108855094_gettyimages-1163654178.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
