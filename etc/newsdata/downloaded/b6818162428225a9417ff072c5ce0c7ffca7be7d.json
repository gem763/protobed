And while online shopping is growing, 77 percent of payments were made in-person.\n\nCreditCards.com reported earlier this year that cash is the preferred payment method even among credit card rewards members. For sales under $10, 43 percent of shoppers opted to pay with cash, compared with 31 percent who paid with credit and 26 who used debit.\n\nBut the lean toward cash declining.\n\nAlready, just 13 percent of adults in Sweden reported using cash for a recent purchase last year, down from 40 percent in 2010. More U.S. adults are going cashless, too.\n\nThe Pew Research Center polled 13,000 adults in 2018 and found a third of Americans made no cash purchases in a typical week, and the share of respondents who said all of their purchases were made with cash fell to 18 percent last year from 24 percent in 2015.\n\nU.S. Bank found similar trends: In a survey of 2,000 Americans, 50 percent said they carry cash less than half the time they\u2019re out, and when they do, 80 percent keep less than $50.\n\nIt\u2019s mostly young people paving the way for more digital sales and less cash, using mobile apps like Apple Pay, CashApp and Venmo. More than one in 10 millennials use their digital wallet for every purchase, according to Experian, particularly on food, rent and Uber.\n\n\u201cMany consumers view credit cards, debit cards, mobile payments and other cashless payment methods as faster and more convenient than paying with cash,\u201d Ted Rossman, an industry analyst at CreditCards.com, told FOX Business. \u201cWith these approaches, there\u2019s no need to fumble with bills and coins and no need to reload your wallet at the ATM, which can carry hefty fees of about $5 for each out-of-network transaction.\u201d\n\nPlus, he added, \u201ccredit cards in particular offer lucrative rewards programs that incentivize consumers to choose that payment method. As long as you\u2019re able to pay your credit card bills in full and avoid interest, rewards are a great way to get cashback or travel points.\u201d\n\nStill, there are drawbacks to going paperless. Studies show people tend to spend more when using plastic, and cashless payments can come with a litany of privacy risks.\n\nA hack at candymaker Russell Stover Chocolates in August, for example, affected the information of thousands of customers\u2019 credit and debit cards. The first six months of 2019 alone have seen nearly 4,000 publicly disclosed breaches, according to intelligence-data website Risk Based Security, exposing 4.1 billion compromised records.\n\nAs such, \u201csome people are uncomfortable with banks and technology companies being able to track their purchases and whereabouts,\u201d Rossman said. Whereas, cash is a bit safer.\n\nThe unbanked are another concern to going cashless, Rossman added, especially for retailers considering all-digital policies. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reports around 20 percent of households are underbanked and 7 percent are completely unbanked.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of people,\u201d Rossman said. And many cities are taking notice. Philadelphia recently became the first large American city to prohibit retailers from going cashless. Lawmakers across the country are working to pass bills forcing retailers to accept cash.\n\nThere\u2019s a noticeable shift from cash to digital, he said, but \u201ccash is still number one.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "A whopping 50 percent of Americans said they carry cash less than half the time they\u2019re out.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
