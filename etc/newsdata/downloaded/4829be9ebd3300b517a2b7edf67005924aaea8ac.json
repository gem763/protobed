Eight weeks to go.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not interested in looking at Tyson Fury, Deontay Wilder or anything else. It\u2019s just about winning one of the biggest heavyweight events of all time.\u201d\n\nJoshua has previously denied rumours he was knocked down while sparring in the build up to the first Ruiz Jr fight.\n\nThe Mexican-American is a unique fighter, and the relatively short time between the announcement of Miller\u2019s replacement and the fight left the Joshua camp struggling to find sparring partners who could replicate Ruiz Jr\u2019s style.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to replicate the style of Andy Ruiz. The guy is 6\u20191\u201d, he\u2019s 19st, and he\u2019s got speed like a middleweight,\u201d Hearn explained previously.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing getting a sparring partner in, it\u2019s getting them to let their hands go against Anthony Joshua. Would you want to do it? You\u2019ve got to be mad to even spar with him, let alone fight him.\n\n\u201c[Last time] we tried to get the sparring in, we struggled a little bit, no excuses, but this time around the preparation has got to be spot on.\u201d", "description": "Anthony Joshua has revamped his sparring with better partners in a bid to win his rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr. Promoter Eddie Hearn has revealed that Joshua struggled to find partners with styles similar to that of Ruiz Jr ahead of their first fight.", "authors": ["Harry Latham-Coyle"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/06/14/joshua.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
