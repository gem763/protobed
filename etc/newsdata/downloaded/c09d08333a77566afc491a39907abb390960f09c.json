Nevertheless, journos are still mad at the inclusion of Breitbart News.\n\nNew York Times writer Charlie Warzel said Facebook was \u201cignorant of the realities of the pro-trump media information war.\u201d\n\nshould clarify: \"outdated\" is an imprecise word. what i mean is it is willfully ignorant of the realities of the pro-trump media information war. \u2014 Charlie Warzel (@cwarzel) October 25, 2019\n\nLeft-wing blogger Judd Legum, a former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer, said Facebook was conferring \u201clegitimacy\u201d on the \u201cfar-right.\u201d\n\nThe distribution and legitimacy that Facebook confers on far-right publishers is a systemic issue I've been working on a story that reveals the massive scope of the problem that will publish Monday Sign up for my newsletter to get it \u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/Gl6evXRDcZ \u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) October 25, 2019\n\nCNN smear specialist Oliver Darcy said Breitbart News is known for \u201cmisinformation.\u201d\n\nOutside Breitbart, it's unclear what other websites known for misinformation might be in Facebook's news tab. The company is declining to release its list as of now. \u2014 Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) October 25, 2019\n\nReplies to Darcy\u2019s tweet showed ordinary Twitter users had a good idea of what websites \u201cknown for misinformation\u201d might be on Facebook\u2019s news tab.\n\nThe director of \u201csocial strategy\u201d at Conde Nast called Facebook\u2019s decision \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\nImportant thread on the outrageous inclusion of Breitbart as a \"trusted\" news source in the Facebook News Tab. https://t.co/TTN5fjbchG \u2014 Nadia Petschek Rawls (@nadiarawls) October 25, 2019\n\nThe editor-in-chief of the Information, a tech news website, called Breitbart\u2019s inclusion \u201cunfortunate.\u201d\n\nNo better example of how a biz models shapes biz decisions than Facebook's unfortunate move to include Breitbart, which is far more advocacy than journalism, in its News Tab. The ad biz pushes companies to a \"both-sides ism\" that thankfully reader-supported businesses can ignore. \u2014 Jessica Lessin (@Jessicalessin) October 25, 2019\n\nLeft-wing advocacy groups were also upset. Sleeping Giants, which specializes in harassing the advertisers of conservative media with smears, accused Breitbart News of \u201cunfettered racism, sexism, and violence.\u201d\n\nThe articles on Breitbart, and the unmoderated comments below them, which feature unfettered racism, sexism and violence, have consistently broken @facebook\u2019s Community Standards. Now they\u2019re featuring this site as \u201ctrusted news.\u201d Who made this decision and what was the reason? \u2014 Sleeping Giants (@slpng_giants) October 25, 2019\n\nWith Nostradamus-like prescience, Media Matters editor-at-large Parker Molloy said she was \u201clooking forward to getting my tweets added to some dumb listicle that\u2019s like \u201cLefties Lose their Minds Over Balance\u201d (because they view this as balance).\u201d\n\nAnyway, looking forward to getting my tweets added to some dumb listicle that\u2019s like \u201cLefties Lose their Minds Over Balance\u201d (because they view this as balance) \u2014 Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) October 25, 2019\n\n\u201cEvery day, Breitbart disseminates conspiracy theories about immigrants and LGBTQ people,\u201d said the official account of Immigration Equality, which has sued the Trump administration four times over its immigration policies.\n\nEvery day, Breitbart disseminates conspiracy theories about immigrants and LGBTQ people. Facebook's decision to partner with the white supremacist-connected site lends credibility to this misinformation and endangers our community. https://t.co/5IEPs02Qch \u2014 Immigration Equality (@IEquality) October 25, 2019\n\nLeft-wing clergyman Chuck Currie, whose Twitter header image features a picture of himself sporting a hoodie with the slogan \u201cJesus was a refugee,\u201d called Facebook an \u201cenabler of hate.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t ever say white nationalism isn\u2019t a critical problem in America. @facebook is an enabler of hate. In a moral universe, Breitbart would be the definition of fake news, not a trusted resource of @fbnewsroom. https://t.co/BD7PEJ1Ool \u2014 Rev. Dr. Chuck Currie (@RevChuckCurrie) October 25, 2019\n\nMark Zuckerberg has reportedly defended Facebook\u2019s decision, saying \u201cI think you want to have content that represents different perspectives.\u201d\n\nAre you an insider at Reddit or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
