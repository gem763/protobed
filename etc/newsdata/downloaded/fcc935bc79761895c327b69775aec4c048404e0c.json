His success is more than a little infuriating when you remember\u2014though of course he would prefer that you forgot\u2014that the original controversy surrounding him wasn\u2019t just partisan noise. The problem with a primetime dance competition giving Spicer a platform to burnish his reputation isn\u2019t that he holds conservative views; it\u2019s that he helped normalize practices, from his invention and repetition of obvious falsehoods to his antagonistic relationship with the press, that were previously beyond the pale for American politics. When Spicer appeared on the Emmys in 2017, just a few months after leaving the White House, former Obama Administration speechwriter David Litt called his comeback \u201can I\u2019m-getting-away-with-it-right-now-because-I-let-the-American-people-down-and-you\u2019re-applauding-me-for-it tour.\u201d Two years later, that tour rolls on.\n\nBergeron needn\u2019t have worried that the former press secretary would inject Republican talking points into DWTS or do anything else to jeopardize what the host described as a \u201cjoyful respite from our exhausting political climate.\u201d (Personally, I would describe the experience of sitting through the two-hour broadcast as more \u201cexcruciating\u201d than \u201cjoyful.\u201d) The danger in casting Spicer isn\u2019t that he could politicize the show; it\u2019s that, with each episode, the show will help to de-politicize Spicer.", "description": "", "authors": ["Judy Berman", "Time.Com Sean-Spicer-Dancing-With-The-Stars-Premiere"], "top_image": ""}
