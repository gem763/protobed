Apparently the man\u2019s 2014 Tesla Model S didn\u2019t brake either.\n\nThe report raises further questions about the effectiveness of Tesla\u2019s system, which was in operation before several other crashes including two fatalities in Florida and one in Silicon Valley. Tesla TSLA, -0.27% warns drivers that the system is not fully autonomous and drivers must be ready to intervene.\n\nThe NTSB report didn\u2019t state a cause of the crash. The agency will issue a final report Wednesday.\n\nThe driver in the Jan. 22, 2018 crash on Interstate 405 was not hurt. But the NTSB report said he did not have his hands on the steering wheel at the time of the crash.\n\nThe fire engine from Culver City, California, had stopped in the northbound high occupancy vehicle lane with its emergency lights flashing as it responded to another crash. The firefighters were also uninjured.\n\nThe Tesla driver, from suburban Woodland Hills, told the NTSB that he was traveling to work in Los Angeles when the crash happened. He told investigators he was looking forward with his hand rested on his knee while touching the bottom of the steering wheel.\n\nJust before the crash, a large vehicle, an SUV or pickup truck, changed lanes in front of him, the driver told the NTSB.\n\n\u201cAlthough the driver stated that he was looking forward, he was unable to see the firetruck in time enough to avoid the crash. The driver had coffee and a bagel at the time, but he wasn\u2019t sure if either was in his hand when the crash occurred,\u201d according to the report.\n\nCellphone data showed the driver was not using his phone to talk or text in the minutes leading up to the crash.\n\nA statement from a driver in a nearby vehicle provided by Tesla said the driver appeared to be looking down at a cellphone or other device he was holding in his left hand before the crash.\n\nThe NTSB determined in September 2017 that design limitations of the Tesla Model S Autopilot played a major role in a May 2016 fatal crash in Florida involving a vehicle operating under Autopilot. But it blamed the crash on an inattentive Tesla driver\u2019s overreliance on technology and a truck driver who made a left turn in front of the car.\n\nThe California investigation comes as the federal government has few regulations governing autonomous vehicles and driver-assist systems that can drive a car under certain circumstances. The systems can significantly reduce crashes, but computer-driven vehicles also can make mistakes.", "description": "A government report says the driver of a Tesla that slammed into a fire engine near Los Angeles last year was using the car\u2019s Autopilot system when a vehicle...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ608_teslac_ZG_20190903174539.jpg"}
