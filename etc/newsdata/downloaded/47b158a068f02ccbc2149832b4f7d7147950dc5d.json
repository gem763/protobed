But you might not be able to stream all of them because of DRM (Digital Rights Management) constraints.\n\nWhat is Widevine?\n\nStreaming services use a special DRM called Widevine, which is owned by Google. It requires Android manufacturers to meet certain criteria for video processing and cryptography that will secure the content being streamed. While Widevine doesn\u2019t require phone makers to pay a fee, they have to pass a test to acquire a certificate. Streaming apps such as Netflix will check for that certificate to stream HD content.\n\nAndroid devices have either L1 (high) or L3 (low) security level of Widevine certification.\n\nHow to check your device compatibility for Disney+\n\nNetflix allows you to stream at 720p if your device doesn\u2019t have an L1 certification. However, Disney+ will only allow you to stream content from its service if you have L1 certification. A Linux developer who goes by the name hansdegoede, tried the service in the Netherlands and found this caveat.\n\nWhile there is no certain list to check if a device has L1 or L3 certification, an Android called DRM info will help you out. Install the app, and open it to see your device\u2019s certification before purchasing a Disney+ subscription.\n\nHopefully, Disney will relax this norm after its launch.\n\nRead next: Aussie Feds seize arms dealer\u2019s Bitcoin, profit 20-fold", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F11%2FDisney-Plus.jpg&signature=e7082e565f491e9ace84875689b96fc5", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
