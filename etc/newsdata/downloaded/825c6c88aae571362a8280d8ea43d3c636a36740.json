There have been six deaths and 450 reported cases of lung illness across 33 states.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Imperial Brands owns the Blu e-cigarette brand\n\nImperial Brands, which is the fourth biggest cigarette firm in the world, has seen strong growth in sales of flavoured e-cigarettes such as its product Blu.\n\nBut it said it now expected growth in its cigarette alternatives division to be lower than expected this year, at 50%.\n\n'Less harmful'\n\nAlong with tougher trading conditions in Africa, Asia and Australasia, it said it now saw group revenues growing by 2%, down from a previously forecast 4%.\n\nVaping devices, which vaporise liquid containing nicotine, have suffered a number of regulatory crackdowns globally.\n\nLast week, India joined other the likes of Brazil and Singapore in banning the sale of e-cigarettes, as it warned of an \"epidemic\" among young people.\n\nIt has come as a blow to tobacco companies, which have been pumping investment into vaping and tobacco heating products.\n\nWhile these products still account for only a fraction of revenue at the biggest firms, demand for them is growing fast.\n\nDespite the regulatory pressure, many countries including the UK have no plans to curb e-cigarette use.\n\nLast week, Public Health England issued a statement saying that \"vaping isn't completely risk free, but is far less harmful than smoking tobacco. There is no situation where it would be better for your health to continue smoking rather than switching completely to vaping,\" it said.", "description": "Britain's Imperial Brands says the recent US crackdown on flavoured e-cigarettes will hurt sales.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/BE7F/production/_108976784_gettyimages-1044550076.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
