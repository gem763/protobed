Trump had been railing against Democrats, accusing them of trying to \u201cblacklist, coerce, cancel or destroy anyone who gets in their way,\u201d when a timely example came to mind.\n\n\u201cLook at what they\u2019re doing today to Justice Kavanaugh,\u201d he said, referencing Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh and drawing jeers from the rally\u2019s attendees. \u201cDid you see the New York Times?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments marked the end of a full day alternating between slamming the Times and defending Kavanaugh over a weekend report from the publication that revealed a new allegation of sexual misconduct against the judge, who weathered similar accusations last year ahead of his confirmation. Kavanaugh has denied the previously reported claims.\n\nThe Saturday piece, an essay adapted from a forthcoming book by two Times reporters, has prompted Democrats to demand further investigations and even impeachment. Conservatives, meanwhile, have slammed the report as an attempt to \u201csmear\u201d Kavanaugh, honing in on the fact that the woman at the center of the latest account reportedly does not remember the incident. This detail was left out of the essay, which was updated with an editor\u2019s note late Sunday.\n\nFor a president who regularly goes after the media, the controversy \u2014 a reminder of one of the most divisive moments in his term \u2014 has provided Trump with red-meat attacks against the Times and the journalists involved.\n\n\u201cI call for the resignation of everybody at the New York Times involved in the Kavanaugh smear story,\u201d Trump said Monday as the crowd cheered. \u201cThe Times is dead, long live the New York Times, and I do want it to live, but they have to change their ways.\u201d\n\n[A book on Kavanaugh has real news. But it\u2019s lost in the furor over a botched New York Times essay.]\n\nThe Times, which was roundly criticized for its framing of the news and for promoting the article with a tweet the newspaper later admitted was \u201coffensive,\u201d published a Q&A on Monday with its deputy editorial page editor to address the blowback. The editor defended the report, noting that the new allegation was corroborated by two government officials, who found it credible. The newspaper did not respond to a request for comment late Monday regarding Trump\u2019s most recent attacks, which began hours earlier on Twitter.\n\n[New York Times apologizes for \u2018inappropriate and offensive\u2019 tweet about Kavanaugh sexual misconduct allegation]\n\nQuoting from a \u201cFox and Friends\u201d segment on the essay, Trump tweeted shortly after 8 a.m. Monday, \u201cThe one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh \u2014 Assaulted by lies and Fake News!\u201d\n\nIn another tweet minutes later, Trump wrote, \u201cDO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY. They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions \u2014 but played the game badly. They should be sued!\u201d\n\nJust Out: \u201cKavanaugh accuser doesn\u2019t recall incident.\u201d @foxandfriends DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY. They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions - but played the game badly. They should be sued! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nOn Monday afternoon, speaking with reporters on the South Lawn ahead of his trip to New Mexico, Trump didn\u2019t hold back after a reporter asked if the people involved with the essay should be fired.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times made another terrible mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that a thing like that could happen.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThey have to be very embarrassed. But much more importantly, what they do is wrong, and they do it all the time.\u201d\n\nBack on Twitter, Trump continued ramping up his criticism, writing at around 5 p.m. that the Times should \u201cclose its doors and throw away the keys.\u201d\n\nThen, he called for everyone involved in the article to resign, a demand he repeated almost verbatim at the New Mexico rally.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do it, but I think they should for the good of the nation,\u201d Trump told the crowd.\n\n...She can never recover, and will never return to Greatness, under current Management. The Times is DEAD, long live The New York Times! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nAs he continued to rail against the Times report and Democrats at the rally, Trump also defended Kavanaugh, calling the judge a \u201cgreat, brilliant man.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say let\u2019s impeach Justice Kavanaugh \u2014 one of the smartest, most brilliant students, top at Yale, incredible life, incredible family,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a made up story.\u201d\n\nBut in Monday\u2019s Q&A, the Times\u2019 deputy editorial page editor, James Dao, said including the new allegation was \u201cwarranted\u201d because the reporters had official corroboration. According to the report, Max Stier, Kavanaugh\u2019s Yale University classmate, said he saw Kavanaugh with his pants down at a college party. Stier, now the head of a prominent nonpartisan group in Washington, alleged that friends pushed Kavanaugh\u2019s penis into the hand of a young woman at the same event. The book\u2019s authors, Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, wrote that senators and the FBI were aware of Stier\u2019s claim but that the FBI did not investigate.\n\nDao did not address the update and editor\u2019s note, but in an interview on MSNBC Monday night, Pogrebin and Kelly said their original draft of the essay mentioned the fact that the woman could not recall the alleged incident. The information was taken out during the editing process, Pogrebin said.\n\n\u201cI think what happened, actually, was we had her name and, you know, the Times doesn\u2019t usually include the name of the victim,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I think in this case, the editors felt like maybe it was probably better to remove it. And in removing her name, they removed the other reference to the fact that she didn\u2019t remember it.\u201d\n\nPogrebin added that she and Kelly were part of the discussion to include the note at the bottom of the amended piece.\n\n\u201cThere was so much heat,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone has been kind of seizing on various aspects of this that we certainly didn\u2019t want this to be an issue anymore. And we certainly never intended to mislead in any way. We wanted to give as full a story as possible.\u201d", "description": "\u201cThe New York Times made another terrible mistake,\u201d Trump told reporters Monday afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that a thing like that could happen.\u201d", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team", "September At Am", "Allyson Chiu Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
