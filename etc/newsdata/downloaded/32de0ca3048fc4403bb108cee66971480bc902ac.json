(AP) - A new harness racing facility near the Kentucky-Tennessee border is hosting its inaugural meet.\n\nThe Leaf Chronicle reports there is still a lot of work to be done at the Oak Grove Racing & Gaming, but the racetrack, paddock and horse stabling barns are complete.\n\nThat was enough to get the racing started on Oct. 18 at the venue that is a joint project of Churchill Downs and Keeneland Association.\n\nA joint statement said opening weekend was a great success with nearly 1,000 fans attending and a field of 172 horses over 24 races. Oak Grove paid out $142,000 in prize purses.\n\nThe meet runs through Nov. 12. Then Oak Grove will close for further construction. The $150 million facility should be fully built out by the summer of 2020.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Leaf-Chronicle, http://www.theleafchronicle.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A new harness racing facility near the Kentucky-Tennessee border is hosting its inaugural meet.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
