For the major broadcast networks, still yoked to the traditional rhythms of the business, more is riding on the days immediately following the Emmys.\n\nBeginning Monday night, the big four broadcasters\u2014ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC\u2014will roll out about 60 new and returning prime-time shows in the space of a week. It\u2019s the official start of the 2019-2020 TV season, as designated by Nielsen in a byzantine system tied to long-standing factors, ranging from the priorities of advertisers, to the looming holiday season, the pro sports calendar, and even autumn\u2019s earlier sunsets.\n\nThe prime-time bottleneck of premiere week seems increasingly outmoded to TV viewers now accustomed to on-demand everything and a year-round flow of shows. Meanwhile, the menu is about to get much longer in coming months as the streaming platforms of Disney , Apple and others media companies launch, offering loads of new programs and libraries of old ones.\n\nSome network schedulers chafe at the narrow launch window they have to work with each fall, when advertising for new cars, big movies and Christmas shopping hits high gear. Cramming most of their premieres into one week accentuates the competition broadcasters face not just from their main network rivals, but also the endless programming alternatives that audiences can summon on-demand.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate thing is we are all screaming in a room full of screaming people,\u201d says Andy Kubitz, ABC\u2019s executive vice president of programming strategy.\n\nNBC\u2019s Emmy-nominated \u2018The Good Place\u2019 will have its season premiere this week.

Still, with broadcasters remaining tied to this seasonal cycle, they\u2019re using premiere week to create a crescendo of marketing and cross-promotion, starting with the Emmys telecast itself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big opportunity to promote the entire business on our air, and do that on the night before premiere week starts,\u201d says Dan Harrison, executive vice president of strategy and scheduling for Fox Entertainment. The Emmy telecast, on Fox this year, rotates annually among the broadcasters.\n\nFox is raising the curtain on its fall season as well as its debut as an independent network. It was carved off when Disney purchased 21st Century Fox\u2019s other major entertainment assets last spring for $71.3 billion. The Fox Network\u2019s parent company, Fox Corp., shares common ownership with Wall Street Journal parent News Corp .\n\nFox\u2019s \u2018The Masked singer\u2019 returns Wednesday with a two-hour season premiere. Photo: FOX\n\nFox\u2019s has three new scripted series, including \u201cProdigal Son,\u201d about a psychologist ( Tom Payne ) who enjoys insights into criminal minds because his father ( Michael Sheen ) was a serial killer. One of Fox\u2019s urgent priorities is keeping afloat its big hit from last year, \u201cThe Masked Singer.\u201d The music/mystery competition returns Wednesday with a two-hour season premiere.\n\nA factor in Fox\u2019s premiere-week hustle is the October pre-emption of shows when it airs Major League Baseball playoff games and the World Series. \u201cPost-season baseball is coming up quickly, so we want to get moving and take advantage of higher viewing levels as it\u2019s getting darker earlier around the country,\u201d Mr. Harrison says.\n\nAfter spreading some of its series debuts into October last year, ABC is again focusing its firepower on the first week of the season. \u201cThe whole point is to try and build habits\u201d among viewers, says ABC\u2019s Mr. Kubitz.\n\nAmong ABC\u2019s returning series, the new shows aiming for lift-off this week are \u201cMixed-ish,\u201d the second spin-off in the \u201cBlack-ish\u201d franchise; \u201cEmergence,\u201da family drama fueled by an eerie mystery; and \u201cStumptown,\u201d starring Cobie Smulders as an Army vet-turned-private eye. Adapted from a graphic novel, the crime show is set not in New York or Los Angeles, but Portland, Ore.\n\nCBS takes a leap into the supernatural with its new series \u2018Evil.\u2019 Photo: CBS\n\nCBS, which hasn\u2019t wavered from its strength-in-numbers approach to premiere week, is adding several new sitcoms, including \u201cBob Hearts Abishola,\u201d an odd-couple courtship story from \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d co-creator Chuck Lorre. From its wheelhouse in hour-long procedurals, including the new courtroom drama \u201cAll Rise,\u201d CBS is taking a leap into the supernatural with producers Michelle and Robert King. The \u201cGood Wife\u201d and \u201cGood Fight\u201d creators are branching out from legal doings for \u201cEvil,\u201d in which a skeptical psychologist and a Catholic priest-in-training investigate alleged demonic possessions and other \u201cX-Files\u201d-ish stuff.\n\nAt the Emmys, NBC was the only network broadcaster represented in the top series-level categories, for its comedy \u201cThe Good Place\u201d and drama \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d Those marquee shows make their return in premiere week, along with the network\u2019s latest effort to inject music into a show that isn\u2019t \u201cThe Voice.\u201d Following last year\u2019s cancellation of high-school musical drama \u201cRise,\u201d NBC is trying \u201cPerfect Harmony,\u201d a comedy featuring Bradley Whitford as a music professor leading a small-town church choir.\n\nThe CW, the fifth-largest broadcast network, looks for elbow room by holding its premieres for the week of Oct. 6. To its returning lineup of DC Comics-based shows, the network is adding \u201cBatwoman.\u201d Ruby Rose stars as the vigilante hero (aka Kate Kane ) who also happens to be lesbian. The CW succeeded in making Archie and Jughead sexy with the noir melodrama \u201cRiverdale,\u201d and now the network is reintroducing another character born in the 1930s: \u201c Nancy Drew, \u201d starring Kennedy McMann as the teen sleuth, makes its debut after \u201cRiverdale\u201d on Oct. 9.\n\nWrite to John Jurgensen at john.jurgensen@wsj.com", "description": "Jumping off the awards fanfare, major broadcast networks\u2014still tied to a seasonal scheduling cycle\u2014will roll out around 60 prime-time shows in one week", "authors": ["John Jurgensen", "John.Jurgensen Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109345/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
