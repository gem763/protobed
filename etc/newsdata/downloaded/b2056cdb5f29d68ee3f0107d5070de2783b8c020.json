It will last for three years, meaning we only have 1,095 more days of philausophy to endure.\n\nIn light of \u201cphilausophy\u201d, Guardian Australia has compiled a list of the best, worst and most baffling Australian tourism ads of recent years, both state and national. From \u201cWhere the bloody hell are you\u201d to the big ball of yarn that briefly terrorised Melbourne.\n\nHave we missed any of your favourite, or least favourite, tourism ads? And where does the latest one rank? Tell us in the comments.\n\nThe bad\n\nPhilausophy \u2013 Australia\n\nForget Foucault, here\u2019s far north Queensland?\n\nPhilausophy has come out of the blocks very slowly. It\u2019s baffling to see and to hear. The pun is strange and, once you get it, not even particularly good, reminiscent of academia rather than fun.\n\nTechnically, the full slogan is \u201cCome live our Philausophy\u201d. The problem is that \u201ccome live our philosophy\u201d is not a thing that anybody really says anyway. \u201cCome live our philosophy\u201d is what you hear before you enter a large, sealed compound in Utah.\n\nAccording to the campaign, there are nine \u201cphilausophies\u201d. These include: mateship, \u201cno worries attitude\u201d, generosity of spirit, sense of adventure and boundless optimism.\n\nBondi-to-Manly interactive: experience Sydney\u2019s spectacular harbour walk Read more\n\nThe tourism minister, Simon Birmingham, said: \u201cPhilausophy is about giving travellers from around the world a taste of what makes Australia such an enjoyable destination by shining a spotlight on the people, lifestyle and personality that make Australian experiences so memorable.\u201d\n\nThese are strings of words that are somehow emptier and more meaningless than the invented word \u201cphilausophy\u201d. It takes a special kind of skill to take something so bad, and make it worse.\n\nWhere the bloody hell are you? \u2013 Australia\n\nThe sands of time have rendered this infamous ad \u2013 devised when now prime minister Scott Morrison was the managing director of Tourism Australia \u2013 better than it first appeared.\n\nMany may now look back on it fondly, with a healthy dose of nostalgia and irony. But there is no escaping the fact that, like \u201cphilausophy\u201d, it was almost completely incomprehensible to people outside Australia.\n\nLara Bingle\u2019s iconic \u201cswear\u201d even resulted in it being banned from many countries, thus falling at the first hurdle for an international ad.\n\nIt\u2019s also not even that appealing to those that do manage to see it. Confusing and jarring, it\u2019s the television equivalent of a jabbed finger and a sign that says, \u201cIf you lived here, you\u2019d be home by now\u201d.\n\nOld mate \u2013 South Australia\n\nIf you cannot handle too much sadness, you genuinely should not watch this ad.\n\nSouth Australia\u2019s latest campaign, launched only last month, is already one of the worst tourism ads ever created.\n\nActively mean, it essentially makes fun of an old man and has been described as \u201cso depressing it needs the Lifeline number at the end\u201d.\n\nTry and follow the twisted logic here. The ad shows an elderly man, called Dave, touring the beautiful sights of Adelaide, but then becoming sad that he didn\u2019t come here earlier. It ends with Dave crying, and the line: \u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for Old Mate \u2013 it\u2019s his own damn fault he didn\u2019t visit Adelaide sooner.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s a write-up where I\u2019ve toned down the tragedy. Watch at your own risk.\n\nJoe McKenzie (@aJoeMcKenzie) \u2018Adelaide: the city that makes old people cry\u2019 is some astonishing branding\n\nThe good\n\nBall of yarn \u2013 Victoria\n\nThis is a tricky one. I\u2019m going to say that it is good. Why? Well we\u2019re talking about it, aren\u2019t we?\n\nNot actively offensive. Not too confusing. Weird enough to hold your interest. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to lose yourself in Melbourne\u201d does what a good ad should. It highlights some distinguishing features about the place (laneways, a supposed sense of whimsy, indie music), and sticks in your head. Even if you hate it, it sort of works.\n\nBe consumed \u2013 South Australia\n\nThis award-winning ad for the Barossa Valley shows how good SA Tourism can be when not making old men weep.\n\nIt\u2019s mostly in here for the music \u2013 Nick Cave\u2019s Red Right Hand. The action is earthy, the camerawork atmospheric and again, it hits the food and wine element people are looking for. Roast a bulb of fennel! Caress some eggs!\n\nDoes it remind people of the Snowtown serial killings and Adelaide\u2019s supposedly abnormally high rate of murders? Maybe. Does the title hint that a visitor to the Barossa may not survive the experience? Perhaps.\n\nBut it also won the grand prix award at the Cannes Corporate Media and TV Awards, so something is going right.\n\nBeautiful one day, perfect the next \u2013 Queensland\n\nSo good they used it twice.\n\nGenuinely snappy and concise, the Queensland campaign slogan has been the state\u2019s official tagline for decades, and has made its way into the collective consciousness.\n\nWhen the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast came around, they used it again.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on a good thing \u2013 stick to it,\u201d said premier Annastacia Palaszczuk.\n\nIt\u2019s clearly stuck in the mind, and has now become a cultural reference in its own right, which is exactly what you want. Visiting US president Barack Obama even said it in 2015.\n\nC U in the NT \u2013 Northern Territory\n\nThis is not actually official. But nothing Northern Territory tourism creates can ever beat \u201cC U in the NT\u201d \u2013 a satirical, viral marketing campaign that first popped up in 2016 and is run by a private company.\n\nIt is miles better than actual Tourism NT slogans, such as 2018\u2019s \u201cBoundless Possible\u201d, which makes no sense.\n\n'Please say hello to my mum': a local's guide to Grafton, New South Wales Read more\n\nYou will still find many, many people who think that C U in the NT is official, and those who know will treasure it anyway.\n\nThe website sells its own merch, and has inspired tonnes of copycats, allowing it to proliferate all across the top end. Darwin City council has attempted to pass bylaws to ban it, but locals have steadfastly ignored them.\n\nMelissa Mackay (@_melissamackay) Our news director recommended blurring C U in the NT for 6pm broadcast, but switch over at 7pm and it\u2019s just... \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb #onlyintheterritory pic.twitter.com/fJ7ETS3LBV\n\nThe baffling\n\nRun, Rabbit, Run \u2013 Victoria\n\nWatch this. Even if you remember this ad from 2004, its weirder than you thought.\n\nQuite sinister, with a lot of over-the-shoulder shots, we peer round hidden corners as people crouch in fields and pursue a couple through the Yarra Valley. \u201cYou\u2019ll never want to leave\u201d, it says. This gets the message across \u2013 but at what cost?\n\nMany moments of this ad are strange, and will have you saying to yourself: \u201cHmm, I don\u2019t remember that.\u201d\n\nMaybe the tides of film culture have shifted in the meantime, and this came across as less frightening back in the day. Maybe it always elicited this response. For some reason, it led to an 18% rise in visitors in its first year.", "description": "As the concept of philausophy is unleashed on an unsuspecting world, please share your views on the good, the bad and the frankly odd campaigns in Australian tourism history", "authors": ["Naaman Zhou"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cbd62637ea9bdf2f3c3776fd423a56d914cedd3/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d8da36877b5739a575b388043ad603a4", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
