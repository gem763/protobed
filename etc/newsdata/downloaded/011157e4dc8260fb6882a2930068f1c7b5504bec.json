It will include two fighter squadrons, an Air Expeditionary Wing, two missile defense batteries and a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD.\n\n\u201cTaken together with other deployments this constitutes an additional 3,000 forces that have been extended or authorized within the last month,\u201d Hoffman said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe United States does not seek conflict with the Iranian regime, but we will retain a robust military capability in the region that is ready to respond to any crisis.\u201d\n\nRising tensions in the Persian Gulf region have been stoked by several attacks against various oil tankers in recent months. The U.S. administration, other Western governments and Saudi Arabia have blamed Tehran for some of the strikes.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the Iranians are responsible for the recent attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities,\u201d Esper told reporters Friday. \u201cOur international partners agree \u2014 including the United Kingdom, France and Germany.\u201d\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s continued malign behavior is part of its larger campaign to destabilize the Middle East and disrupt the global economy. Iran\u2019s attempts to use terror, intimidation and military force to advance its interests are inconsistent with international norms.\u201d\n\nHoffman said Esper informed Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman Friday of the decision and called on European allies and \u201cother like-minded countries\u201d to follow suit.\n\n\u201cSince May, the Department of Defense has increased the number of forces by approximately 14,000 to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility as an investment into regional security,\u201d Hoffman said.\n\nThe U.S. aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln is already in the Gulf region and will remain until the end of the year.", "description": "Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 The U.S. Defense Department announced Friday it will send thousands of additional troops and more equipment to Saudi Arabia, in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
