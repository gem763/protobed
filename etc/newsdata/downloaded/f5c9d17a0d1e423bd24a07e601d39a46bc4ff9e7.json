You can form your own view.

Time and time again we see people in positions of power fail us. I couldn\u2019t be more disappointed in how Disney treats their underage talent like cash cows.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

She alleges that the abuse began when she joined the label at 14, and continued until a week before her 16th birthday. She claims that the abuse involved oral sex, and that Thomas took her virginity. She also alleges that she was drugged and anally penetrated.\n\nThe suit claims that Thomas groomed Pruitt, controlling her professional life, distancing her from boys her own age, and criticising her appearance and ability.\n\nThomas is a prolific Nashville producer, having worked with country music star Ronnie Milsap, gospel singers Bebe and Cece Winans and Christian pop artist Amy Grant.\n\nFor the past 20 years, he has worked with many teenage female singers and in 2013 starred on Chasing Nashville, a Lifetime reality show following four girls pursuing their country music dreams.\n\nDisney and Hollywood Records did not comment on the complaint. Thomas directed a request for comment to his attorney, who did not respond to Variety.\n\nThe suit was originally filed under a pseudonym and was amended with the real names of the parties on Tuesday.\n\nPruitt is currently writing a book about her experience, entitled AA: Abused Anonymous.", "description": "Jordan Pruitt, a contestant on series three of the American version of The Voice, has filed a sexual abuse lawsuit against her former manager Keith Thomas.", "authors": ["Ellie Harrison"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/07/jordan-pruitt.jpg"}
