They\u2019re under enough pressure already.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need us coaches doing what he is doing. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, as a coach or a team, you can always find things after a game and get emotional about the fact that it is against you and not the opposition. We have done it ourselves.\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the day they go out there to do the best that they can and, yes, they don\u2019t get it right all the time, we have suffered from that, just like other teams.\u201d\n\nThe All Blacks were often alleged by fans and pundits to have received favourable treatment from match officials during a decade-long reign at the top of the world rankings.\n\nErasmus said he knew from personal experience that 50-50 decisions were likely to go your way if you came into a match with a reputation or on a lengthy winning streak.\n\n\u201cThere is certainly a time when you get that respect and even referees buy into that respect,\u201d Erasmus said. \u201cBecause you are playing so well, referees tend to almost find it tough to penalise you in 50-50 decisions.\u201d\n\nThree-times champions New Zealand were knocked off the top of the world rankings earlier this month after a draw with South Africa and a loss to Australia, with first Wales and then Ireland taking over as number one.\n\nErasmus believes the perception that as many as six teams will be in contention for the title this year could help.\n\n\u201cI think the way rugby has evolved in the last year or so, all teams are so close currently,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThis is a World Cup where any team can beat any team. That is the way it should be - referees should be open-minded going into test matches - which they are currently.\u201d\n\nWorld Rugby chief executive Brett Gosper said on Tuesday that he believed the referees for this World Cup were better resourced and trained than officials at any previous tournament.\n\n\u201cThis is the best prepared group of match officials we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s in place for as much consistency as possible.\u201d\n\nGarces is widely regarded to favour dominant teams at the breakdown and scrum.\n\nThe Frenchman has also handed out red cards to two All Blacks - Sonny Bill Williams in a 2017 British and Irish Lions test and Scott Barrett last month - as well as South Africa\u2019s Damian de Allende against New Zealand in 2017.", "description": "New Zealand coach Steve Hansen has dismissed the notion that referees favour in-form teams and says comments by counterpart Rassie Erasmus ahead of Saturday's Rugby World Cup opener against South Africa were aimed at putting the match officials under pressure.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431519210&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0G8-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
