the solution to Irish border issues agreed by former PM Theresa May which proved unpalatable to many MPs.\n\nHowever, his plans would see Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK - something the DUP, among others, has great concerns about.\n\nThe DUP has helped prop up the Conservative government since the 2017 general election.\n\nIn the past, a number of Tory Brexiteers have said their own support for a Brexit deal was contingent on the DUP's backing of any agreement.\n\nThe view from the UK...\n\nThe decision by the DUP to reject Mr Johnson's deal is a potential body blow.\n\nNot only would it seem to scupper the PM's prospects of securing a deal in Brussels today, but it also suggests he would be unable to win any subsequent vote in the Commons.\n\nIn their statement, however, the DUP do not quite close the door to a possible compromise in the future, implying were there further concessions, they might be won round.\n\nThe DUP highlight the new customs regime and the issue of consent as the key sticking points.\n\nHowever, it's understood issues around securing the consent of Stormont to the new customs regime have become paramount.\n\nThe fear in the DUP is that under the simple majority vote required by the EU to ensure continued membership of the new customs arrangement, the unionist community would have no veto.\n\nSo they worry they could remain trapped in an arrangement where increasingly the political and economic pull would be towards Dublin and Brussels, rather than London - threatening their core belief in the union.\n\nThe BBC has learned that the draft Brexit deal has a mechanism enabling Northern Ireland to approve or reject the border plans.\n\nThis would give the Stormont Assembly the chance to vote on Brexit arrangements four years after the Brexit transition period ends in 2020.\n\nBut the DUP has demanded assurances around this so-called consent mechanism.\n\nMr Jenrick said there would be more \"intensive\" work in the \"coming hours and days\" to reassure parties.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Movements and compromises have been required, but we are close to an agreement.\n\n\"We now need to go back and see what more we can do to persuade each side so we can get this done.\"\n\nMr Jenrick added: \"It would be a huge missed opportunity to miss this chance to get Brexit over the line and to move on with the life of the country.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Macron: 'I want to believe Brexit 'being finalised'\n\nAs well as the DUP, Mr Johnson is also trying to secure support from Tory Brexiteers, most of whom are part of the European Research Group.\n\nERG chairman Steve Baker told reporters after a meeting in Downing Street on Wednesday evening his group \"hope [to] be with the prime minister, but there are thousands of people out there who are counting on us not to let them down and we are not going to\".\n\n\"We know there will be compromises, but we will be looking at this deal in minute detail with a view to supporting it, but until we see that text, we can't say.\"\n\nFormer Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who wants any new deal to be put back to the public to approve, said it was not \"realistic\" for the prime minister to expect Parliament to scrutinise and approve a legal text on Saturday - even if Mr Johnson does manage to finalise the plan with the EU.\n\n\"I would normally expect there to be a week at least between a text being laid before Parliament and Parliament voting on such a matter of importance,\" the backbench Conservative MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nThe Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said that if a deal cannot be completed at the two-day summit, European leaders could gather again before the end of the month to continue Brexit talks.\n\nThe view from the EU...\n\nThis morning's statement from the DUP throws into jeopardy the planned choreography of the summit, which would have seen Boris Johnson and the 27 other leaders approve a revised Brexit deal when they met this afternoon.\n\nBut the EU's been here before with Theresa May, and knew that support for the deal at Westminster wasn't guaranteed.\n\nThat's why negotiators tried to address the concerns of the DUP - and the unionist community in general - in the new text of the agreement, with a promise that some goods crossing the Irish sea would be exempt from customs checks and by giving Stormont a choice about how Northern Ireland is treated in future.\n\nBut the EU says it could never give the Northern Ireland Assembly an up-front veto over the arrangements coming in to force in the first place.\n\nAnd that's one of the DUP's big demands.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Johnson likened the Brexit talks to climbing Everest, saying the summit was \"not far\" but still surrounded by \"cloud\", according to MPs he addressed at the 1922 committee of backbenchers.\n\nMr Johnson faces another deadline on Saturday - the date set out in the so-called Benn Act, which was passed last month by MPs seeking to avoid a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIf MPs have not approved a deal - or voted for leaving the EU without one - by Saturday, then Mr Johnson must send a letter to the EU requesting an extension to 31 January 2020 - something he has repeatedly refused to do.\n\nOn Wednesday, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay confirmed Mr Johnson would write such a letter if no deal was in place by Saturday.\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman confirmed the government will table a motion for Parliament to sit this Saturday from 09:00 to 14:00 BST.\n\nHowever, this does not mean the House of Commons will definitely sit on Saturday - the government could table the motion but not push it to a vote.", "description": "It is a blow for Boris Johnson as the PM heads to EU summit for more talks on his draft agreement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F2CC/production/_109265126_fosterjohnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
