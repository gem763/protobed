The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 1.1%.\n\nThe U.S. and China said last week they were moving toward an initial trade agreement, with Washington forgoing an increase in tariffs on imports from China that was scheduled for the coming days. While Beijing agreed to boost purchases of U.S. agricultural products, details remained elusive, and disagreements on other issues remained unresolved.\n\n\"At the end of the day, all that happened on Friday was the tariffs were postponed,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.\n\nState-run China Daily published an opinion piece Sunday suggesting that \"the champagne should probably be kept on ice,\" until a deal is signed, as Washington may yet reverse its decision.\n\n\"While the U.S. side has played up the agreement, in China, the reports have been much more measured,\" Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, said.\n\nBrent crude, the global benchmark for oil, fell 2.3% to $59.12 a barrel as trade concerns dampened the economic growth outlook. Investors sent gold, considered a haven, up 0.7%.\n\nAdding to the global growth concerns, Chinese trade data released Monday showed further declines in the country's exports in September, largely as a result of the trade dispute.\n\nStill, stocks in Asia, which ended trade Friday before President Trump said the U.S. and China had completed the early stages of a deal, rallied Monday. The Shanghai Composite gauge advanced 1.2% while the benchmark Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong rose 0.8%. The Chinese yuan strengthened 0.2% to 7.0661 a dollar in offshore trading.\n\nIn Europe, the pound fell about 0.7% against the dollar and the euro. The weekend of talks between European Union and British negotiators, who face a deadline this week to reach a deal on Brexit, failed to yield a breakthrough. Diplomats said even the outline of a deal looked difficult to clinch, given the gap between the sides and the complexity of the issues. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index dropped 0.6%.\n\nWhile U.S. bond markets will be closed Monday for Columbus Day, stock trading will resume, though likely with lower volumes than normal.\n\nWrite to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Joanne Chiu at joanne.chiu@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 14, 2019 06:45 ET (10:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
