That made the U.S. pullout even more bitter.\n\n\u201cThe Americans couldn\u2019t do a thing for us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an American betrayal of northeast Syria and the Kurdish people.... They left us between the jaws of a pincer.\u201d\n\nCaught in the crossfire, Meshmesh and his family are waiting, helplessly, to see how the shifting web of rivalries and alliances plays out in the tangled battlefield of northeastern Syria, which the Kurdish YPG militia controls.\n\nThe past week has redrawn the map of Syria yet again after more than eight years of war. Washington\u2019s move to pull out of the region, opening the way for Ankara\u2019s offensive, left Kurdish forces scrambling for protection. So the Kurds invited in the Syrian army and its ally Russia.\n\nMeshmesh said he would rather have Syrian troops take his hometown than see it fall to Turkish forces \u2014 which he fears would make him a target for his Kurdish ethnicity. Turkey launched the operation in the region to target the YPG, which it brands a threat to Turkey.\n\nThe ethnically mixed northeast region is home to up to 2 million people, including Kurds, Arabs, Assyrians and others, many of them uprooted from other parts of Syria.\n\nThe Syrian army\u2019s deployment raises questions about the fate of a region where the YPG and its local allies have carved out self-rule for years.\n\nMaking matters even more fraught, the humanitarian group M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders) announced Tuesday that it had suspended most of its activities in the region and evacuated all its international staff.\n\nMeshmesh said the new reality on the ground could pose a threat for people who had evaded mandatory military service or Kurdish activists who are wanted by the government.\n\nFor him, that paled in comparison to the Turkish incursion. \u201cIt is an existential problem,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be Syrian,\u201d he said. \u201cI prefer the Syrian government ... even if it may weaken the rights and dreams that were built in the past eight years.\u201d\n\nBut with territory shifting hands at lightning speed and a new exodus unfolding, Syrians must weigh up tough choices over where to seek shelter.\n\nIn the city of Raqqa farther south, a young Syrian Arab man hid in his home Tuesday, frantically following the news, worried about the prospect of Syrian government forces coming back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m living in a state of terror. I can\u2019t sleep at night,\u201d said the opposition activist, who is in his 20s and didn\u2019t want to give his name because he is afraid of retribution. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nHe has remained in his city since early in the war even as its rulers shifted from rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s rule to Islamic State militants and then to Kurdish fighters. But now he fears a return of state rule because of his past work with local outlets and activists opposed to Assad.\n\nSyrian Kurdish leaders have said the deal with Damascus involves only army troops deploying at the border, and there has been no official comment from the Syrian government.\n\nBut the activist and a second Raqqa resident said they still worried that Kurdish forces would cut a deal with Damascus and hand over Raqqa.\n\nSome in the city who support Damascus rallied on Monday, calling for a return of its rule and carrying photos of Assad for the first time in years, he said.\n\nIf it comes to it, his siblings, like many others, would have no problem staying in Raqqa, so he would have to find a way out alone, he said.\n\nHe hopes to get smuggled into territory in the north under the control of mainly Sunni Arab Syrian rebels funded and trained by Turkey, a swathe of Syria where Turkish forces are stationed. For now, though, he is waiting to see what happens.\n\nThe activist said he had heard from relatives in the north that some rebels had been looting and acting inappropriately but he would feel safer there than under state rule.\n\n\u201cListen, nobody is good \u2014 they\u2019re all criminals,\u201d he said. \u201cBut some are easier than others.\u201d", "description": "Driven from his hometown in northeast Syria as bombs rained down in a Turkish assault, a Kurdish father worried for his toddler son, who was ill, and accused America of betraying the Kurds in the region.", "authors": ["Ellen Francis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
