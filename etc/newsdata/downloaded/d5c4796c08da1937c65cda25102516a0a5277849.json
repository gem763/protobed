Courtesy Hansons Auctioneers and Valuers Ltd\n\nThe 75th anniversary of World War II\u2019s most iconic prisoner-of-war escape is less than two weeks away, on March 24, 2019. Just in time, Hansons Auctioneers in England is offering a rare relic of the daring feat: a diary that takes us inside the mind of one of the prisoners who planned it.\n\nIn its \u201cMedals & Militaria\u201d auction on March 22, 2019, Hansons will sell the journal that belonged to the late Royal Air Force Flight Lieutenant Vivian Phillips while he was held in the Nazis\u2019 Stalag Luft III camp, in present-day Poland. According to the auction house, it is the only such diary believed to have survived not only the camp, \u201cbut also a forced march of hundreds of miles across Germany\u201d later in the war. It is expected to sell, alongside Phillips\u2019s medals, for around $20,000 (or, \u00a315,000 to \u00a318,000).\n\nPhillips\u2019s depiction of a guard dog at the camp.

He joined prisoners from a variety of countries including the United States, Canada, Australia, France, Norway, Latvia, and Belgium in Stalag Luft III, which the Nazis considered one of their more secure POW camps. That\u2019s why Roger Bushell\u2014a Royal Air Force pilot who had been shot down during the rescue at Dunkirk, and who had subsequently escaped from two German POW camps\u2014was being held there when Phillips arrived. Undeterred, Bushell was planning another escape, despite the microphones that the Nazis had placed nine feet beneath the ground, and the sandy terrain that did not lend itself to tunnel construction.\n\nAs History details, the prisoners dug their tunnels\u2014codenamed Tom, Dick, and Harry\u2014via a trapdoor underneath a stove, which was kept lit in order to deter guards from approaching it. Slowly, they were able to dig beneath the range of the microphones, taking off their clothing so the guards wouldn\u2019t notice any telltale sandy stains.\n\nPhillips\u2019s \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d list. Courtesy Hansons Auctioneers and Valuers Ltd\n\n\u201cAll this was done under the very noses of the guards,\u201d wrote Phillips in his journal, one of those distributed to POWs by the Canadian Red Cross. He himself was one of the diggers, which Hansons says would have suited him as he was \u201crather short of stature and from Welsh coal-mining stock.\u201d Phillips wrote that, eventually, he \u201cgraduated to a kind of foreman\u201d in \u201ccharge of a gang of eight fellows\u2026\u201d A model of classic British stoicism, Phillips nonchalantly noted that \u201cthe whole thing was most efficiently run\u2026\u201d The operation inspired the 1963 Hollywood classic, The Great Escape.\n\nWhen the time came for the prisoners to put their tunnels to use, they had to draw names at random so as not to overwhelm the makeshift passageways. Phillips\u2019s name was not drawn, but he was actually lucky: Only three of the 76 escapees ultimately eluded the Nazis. The rest were caught within two weeks, and 50 of the prisoners\u2014including Bushell\u2014were then (illegally) executed on Hitler\u2019s personal orders. (A postwar military tribunal found 18 Nazis guilty of war crimes for the executions; 13 of them were executed in turn.)\n\nAnd so, even with all of the writings and drawings depicting daily life in the POW camp, and describing plans for the escape plot, the most striking section of Phillips\u2019s journal may be the \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d list, which names the executed captured prisoners and their countries of origin. It cements the journal as more than a record of brilliant enterprise in the face of fierce adversity, but as a testament to enduring humanity in times of brutality.", "description": "", "authors": ["Isaac Schultz", "July", "Rohini Chaki", "June", "Matthew Taub", "March", "Jessica Leigh Hester", "November"], "top_image": "https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvYXNzZXRzLzY4Yjg3MmRhLTU4M2YtNDQ2NC1iMWY1LTAxYWE5NTJmZGMxNDA5ODE2ODZiMzFkNWU0YTZmY19QT1dzIGluIGNhbXAgIDEgY3JlZGl0IEhhbnNvbnMuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCAiXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjIzODh4MTU5MisyNTkrNDQwIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiNjAweD4iXV0/POWs%20in%20camp%20%201%20credit%20Hansons.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-11"}
