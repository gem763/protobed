I\u2019m not even sure if there is a plan. How can I broach this?\n\nI can empathize. I recall, after my father died, trying to convince my mother that she needed to update her decades-old will and related documents. This took a good year or two; she simply didn\u2019t want to talk about it. So, starting a conversation like this can be difficult at best. Two approaches might help.\n\nFirst, try telling your parents that you would like to talk with them about their estate plan\u2014not because you want to know what, or how much, you might inherit, but because you want to make sure the transfer of their assets goes as smoothly as possible after they die. After all, you or one of your siblings, in all likelihood, will be responsible for carrying out your parents\u2019 wishes.\n\nAsk a Question Have a question about planning for and living in retirement? Email askencore@wsj.com.\n\nIf you think that approach is too blunt, try this: Tell your parents that you\u2019re doing your own estate planning, and the more you know about the family\u2019s finances as a whole, the better job you can do. It certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt to mention that your children\u2014your parents\u2019 grandchildren\u2014will benefit from such preparations. (It\u2019s an argument a grandparent might find hard to resist.)\n\nAnd please: If you or any of your siblings are interested in inheriting a particular item or heirloom, a sit-down with your parents is even more important. At times, the smallest objects\u2014a watch, a painting, a set of dishes\u2014can generate the biggest fights among heirs.\n\nAgain, I recognize that conversations about money are difficult for many families. And conversations about death can be even more difficult. If there\u2019s a silver lining here, your attempts to talk about estate plans may prod your parents to make an appointment with their lawyer to spell out their wishes more clearly. Knowing that your parents have a will in place, at the very least, and that they have met with their lawyer in the past few years can give you some peace of mind.\n\nTransfers of Wealth Between 1995 and 2016, an average 1.7 million households a year received an inheritance. About half of these 'intergenerational transfers' were less than $50,000: Less than $50,000 55.5% $50,000\u2013 $249,999 30.3% $250,000\u2013 $499,999 8.2% $500,000\u2013 $999,999 3.9% $1 million+ | 2.1%\n\nFinally, let me open this topic to our readers: If a particular approach has worked for you when it comes to talking with older family members about finances and estate plans, please write us at askencore@wsj.com. We\u2019ll do our best to get your thoughts into a future column.\n\n***\n\nI have almost all of my retirement assets, except Social Security, in Vanguard funds and believe they provide diversification. Should I transfer a portion of my Vanguard assets to another company, such as Fidelity or T. Rowe Price ? I think it unlikely that Vanguard would encounter a Bernie Madoff-type situation, but I have concerns about having most of my investment eggs in one basket.\n\nI shared this question with several financial advisers, and their answers were invariably the same: Not to worry.\n\n\u201cVanguard is one of the largest global investment firms, and there are numerous provisions in place to protect client assets,\u201d says Charlie Farrell, chief executive officer of Northstar Investment Advisors in Denver.\n\nStill, as we have mentioned many times in this column, the best investment plans are those that allow you to sleep soundly at night. With that in mind, \u201cif a single account really bothers an investor, there is nothing wrong with having another account at a large custodian,\u201d Mr. Farrell adds. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little more of a hassle.\u201d\n\n***\n\nFriends of mine are having a debate. Some of us are under the impression that the level of coverage for Medicare might be affected by the state/jurisdiction where you first enroll. So, here\u2019s my question: Does it matter in which state your first enrollment occurs? If so, which states are more advantageous?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter where you live if you decide to enroll in traditional Medicare; your coverage for Part A (hospital bills) and Part B (doctors\u2019 bills) would be the same. But\u2026the state where you live, as well as a move between states, could affect other pieces of the Medicare puzzle.\n\nStart with Medicare Advantage, an alternative to traditional Medicare, and Medicare Part D, prescription-drug benefits. Both types of coverage are provided by private insurers, as opposed to the federal government. As such, these plans\u2014their cost, availability and benefits\u2014vary from state to state. What\u2019s more, if you move to a new state, your existing Medicare Advantage or Part D plan may no longer cover you, which would mean searching for new insurance.\n\nPhoto: iStock\n\nThen there\u2019s Medicare Supplement Insurance, better known as Medigap. Such policies, which help pay bills that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover, also are sold by private insurers and are regulated primarily by individual states. The good news here: Some states are more lenient than others when it comes to enrolling in, or changing, a Medigap policy, says Neil Brown, a Medicare insurance consultant in Las Vegas.\n\nFor example, under federal guidelines, individuals who enroll in Medicare Part B have six months to sign up for a Medigap policy regardless of any health problems. After that window closes, insurers in most states can place restrictions on coverage due to pre-existing conditions. But if you\u2019re a resident of Missouri, for example, you have a two-month period each year in which you can switch insurers without penalty if you keep the same level of coverage.\n\nThe larger point: You should familiarize yourself with the rules governing Medicare Advantage, prescription-drug plans and Medigap policies in your particular state before buying coverage. A good starting point: \u201cState-specific Medicare information\u201d at Medicareresources.org. (At the top of the home page, click on: States.) Again, with Medigap in particular, some states, Mr. Brown notes, \u201cmight be considered more advantageous because they enable enrollment in Medigap well beyond the federally mandated period.\u201d\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal.
