The allegations were that Trump had some quid pro quo with the Ukrainian leadership, that he wanted them to investigate Biden\u2019s son for corruption, and that he might tie this move with aid to the country (via WSJ):\n\nPresident Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden \u2019s son, according to people familiar with the matter, urging Volodymyr Zelensky about eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani on a probe that could hamper Mr. Trump\u2019s potential 2020 opponent. \u201cHe told him that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know\u201d if his lawyer\u2019s assertions that Mr. Biden acted improperly as vice president were true, one of the people said. Mr. Giuliani has suggested Mr. Biden\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to fight corruption had to do with an investigation of a gas company for which his son was a director. A Ukrainian official this year said he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden or his son Hunter Biden. Mr. Trump in the call didn\u2019t mention a provision of U.S. aid to Ukraine, said this person, who didn\u2019t believe Mr. Trump offered the Ukrainian president any quid pro quo for his cooperation on any investigation. The interactions between the president, Mr. Giuliani and Ukraine have come under scrutiny in recent days in the wake of a whistleblower complaint that a person familiar with the matter said involves the president\u2019s communications with a foreign leader. The complaint, which the Washington Post reported centers on Ukraine, has prompted a new standoff between Congress and the executive branch.\n\nWell, first, the president can say whatever he wants to a foreign leader and it\u2019s not the job of the intelligence community to snitch on the president concerning communications like this. It\u2019s a gross overreach. Anyone who isn\u2019t a semi-mentally defective anti-Trump Democrat could see this from at least 1,000 miles away. This story was trash, the allegations were fake, and it wouldn\u2019t lead to Trump being in hot water. Once again, the Trump White House came out on top. Once again, anonymous and politically biased sources tried to deliver a death blow to the Trump White House. It failed.\n\nIn the publication\u2019s op-ed section, columnist Kimberley Strassel, who has torched many of the liberal talking points peddled by the Left in their years-long crusade to impeach Trump, went on a lengthy Twitter thread dissecting the latest spate of nonsensical allegations lobbed at the Trump White House over this phone call. One, Trump was asking Ukraine for assistance in a U.S. investigation into 2016 election meddling, and it was the Ukrainians that brought up Biden. This is another \u201cnon-smoking gun.\u201d Also, it proved that everyone got this story totally and utterly wrong.\n\n1) Having read DOJ\u2019s Trump-Ukraine release, here\u2019s the real story: This is another internal attempt to take out a president, on the basis of another non-smoking-gun. \u2014 Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019\n\n2)As to call transcript itself: Trump\u2019s actual \u201cfavor\u201d is that Ukraine look backward, to what happened in the 2016 election. This is a legitimate ask, since election meddling looks to have come from both Russia and Ukraine. \u2014 Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019\n\n3)(Indeed, this is a big enough issue that we find out this morning that U.S. Attorney John Durham is looking at what role the Ukraine played in the FBI investigation.) \u2014 Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019\n\n4)It is actually Zelensky who brings up Rudy Giuliani\u2014saying they can\u2019t wait to \u201cmeet him.\u201d And it is Zelensky who references \u201cthat investigation,\u201d as he goes on to promise that \u201call investigations will be done openly and candidly.\u201d \u2014 Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019\n\n5)Trump says \u201cgood\u201d and expresses worries that a \u201cgood\u201d prosecutor was \u201cshut down.\u201d Mentions \u201cBiden\u2019s son\u201d and that Biden bragged he \u201cstopped the prosecution.\u201d Ends that bit with \u201cIt sounds horrible to me.\u201d \u2014 Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019\n\n6)Trump's several references to Giuliani are mostly to say what a great guy he is. He says he will have Giuliani and AG Barr call. He asks Zelensky to speak/work with both. \u2014 Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019\n\n7)And, never mind, because: DOJ in statement says the President has not spoken to AG about investigating Biden and has not asked the AG to contact the Ukraine. Also, Barr has not communicated with Ukraine\u2014\u201con this or any subject.\u201d \u2014 Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019\n\n8)Meanwhile, the IG back in August referred this to DOJ as potential violation of campaign finance law, based on whistleblower complaint. Criminal Division evaluated and determined no violation: \u201cAll relevant components of the Department agreed with this legal conclusion.\u201d \u2014 Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019\n\n9) Whistleblower? Look at this nugget, referenced in the OLC opinion. The IG\u2019s review found \"some indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate.\u201d \u2014 Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019\n\n10)Media got all this so wrong. And Democrats look all the more partisan and radical to have moved toward impeachment. \u2014 Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 25, 2019\n\nAnd now these clowns want to push impeachment over an allegation shoddier that the Trump-Russia collusion myth?
