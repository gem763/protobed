All hope that today they will secure a job as a domestic worker in the Gulf states, cooking, cleaning and caring for another family thousands of miles from their own homes.\n\nPamela Mbogo* is one of them. The 29-year-old has found a job in Saudi Arabia starting next month. It\u2019s not her first time as a domestic worker. On the previous occasion she lived and worked for a family in Bahrain, where she was abused and locked inside the house for days at a time. Yet, this time, Mbogo believes it will be different.\n\n\u201cThe first time I went, I went in an illegal, chaotic situation through brokers who did not prepare us for what lay ahead,\u201d says Mbogo. \u201cI am more confident this time. I believe all will be well.\u201d\n\nHer confidence comes from a raft of legal reforms that Kenya has recently put in place to try to make it safe for women to travel to the Gulf to work.\n\nThe region is the most dangerous place in the world to find work for migrant domestic workers such as Mbogo. The Gulf has long been notorious for labour trafficking, with the 2.5 million-strong domestic workforce particularly vulnerable to widespread physical and sexual abuse, and having their passports and salaries withheld by employers.\n\nUnderpinning this abuse is the kafala system, which prevents migrant workers from changing jobs without their employer\u2019s consent. It can mean that women who face abuse at the hands of their employers are left trapped and facing arrest if they try to flee.\n\nReports of east African workers being raped and tortured across the region and haunting videos of Kenyan women pleading for help after allegedly being abused by their employers saw the Kenyan government follow other countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines in banning its citizens from travelling to work in the Gulf in 2014.\n\nSince then the government has been grappling with how to allow women and the country\u2019s economy to benefit from the huge demand for migrant domestic workers from countries such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, while keeping those who want to travel for work safe.\n\nThis year it introduced measures to mitigate the risk of abuse.\n\nBefore, Kenyan recruitment agencies had no legal obligation to bring women facing abuse home. Under the new rules, if a Kenyan woman is abused, agencies must help them leave, with the cost of their rescue coming out of a 1.5m Kenyan shilling (\u00a311,000) bond that the agent has to pay to operate.\n\nThe government has also negotiated an agreement with Saudi Arabia to enforce a minimum monthly wage of 40,000 Kenyan shillings (\u00a3300), as well as food and housing.\n\nIn recent months, newly registered recruitment agencies have been allowed to start sending domestic workers to the Middle East again.\n\nAt the Centre for Domestic Training and Development (CDTD) just outside Nairobi, students are cheerful and excited about their future as they make beds in mock bedrooms, cook chapati in practice kitchens, and study basic Arabic. Demand for the course is huge. About 350\u2013400 women are already graduating each month.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Edith Murogo in her office outside Nairobi. She worries that the new rules will have little effect in the Gulf states.

I have prepared my girls very well. They are ready for the market,\u201d says Murogo. \u201cBut is that market ready for them? Are they going to respect the rules? Are their governments ready to hold [abusers] accountable?\u201d\n\nPaul Adhoch, the executive director of Trace Kenya, a Mombasa-based counter-trafficking NGO, works relentlessly to protect Kenyan women who leave home to take up domestic worker posts in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Bahrain. He says that he\u2019s seen the ban have a positive impact, but the calls for help are still coming in.\n\nThe government may be well meaning, but I do not think it can change the attitude those people have to domestic workers Neema Khamis, abused worker\n\n\u201cWith the new rules it\u2019s easier,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in the last two weeks we have had three desperate calls from women [in the Gulf]. They have their passports and phones taken away, but they look for a Kenyan face when their employers send them to the mall and they approach them for help. They ask them to call us.\u201d\n\nHe estimates that there are at least 120,000 Kenyans in the Middle East, roughly one-third of whom have been trafficked. He uses outreach work to get his phone number into the hands of Kenyan workers before they go.\n\nHe and his colleagues at Trace are worried that, despite repeated requests, the government has not made the content of the new bilateral agreements with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE available to NGOs or to the public. Requests from the Guardian for copies of those agreements also received no response.\n\nThe Kenyan government\u2019s new website with information on credible employment agencies, launched as part of the reforms, is still only available in English, despite the fact that many low-income Kenyans are more comfortable in Kiswahili.\n\nDespite the Kenyan government\u2019s claim that the Saudi government had agreed a minimum wage, workers still report to Adhoch that they are earning as little as 18,000 Kenyan shillings \u2013 if they get paid at all.\n\nIn Kenya 42% of the population live below the poverty line and many women are prepared to risk abuse to send their desperately needed salary home.\n\nAdhoch warns that \u201crogue brokers\u201d have already emerged to circumvent the new regulations. \u201cThey say: \u2018You don\u2019t want to wait for a training course, an official visa, a passport? Pay me, and I can get you to the Middle East right now,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThese rogue labour brokers traffick workers abroad with fake visas, false promises, and no way to get home.\u201d\n\nQatar passes law to protect employment rights of domestic workers Read more\n\nOnly a broken leg allowed Shani Hassan* to escape to Kenya when she took a job in Saudi Arabia just before the ban was put in place. She was allowed to sleep for only two hours a night, and given little more than noodles to eat.\n\nAfter more than a year of abuse, her employer\u2019s son threw Hassan down the stairs, breaking her leg, leaving her unable to work. Finally, she was allowed to go home.\n\nShe says that she sees the cycle repeating itself. Her younger cousin took a job in Bahrain immediately after the ban was lifted. After only three weeks, Hassan says, her cousin escaped, open wounds still visible on her face from beatings.\n\nHassan doesn\u2019t believe that any policy emanating from east Africa can change the deep-rooted racism and abuse of foreign domestic workers across the Middle East. \u201cThe government may be well meaning, but I do not think it can change the attitude those people have towards domestic workers from Africa or Kenya,\u201d says Hassan. \u201cThey view us as slaves.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Jillian Keenan is a contributing journalist for the Fuller Project for International Reporting, a nonprofit newsroom investigating issues that most impact women.
