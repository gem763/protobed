So naturally, I lost my fucking mind when I saw that Gabrielle and her daughter Kaavia dressed up as Clovers head cheerleader Isis and bebe head cheerleader.\n\n\u201cBrought it. #CaliforniaLove,\u201d the 46-year-old actress captioned her Instagram photo.\n\nView this post on Instagram Brought It. #CaliforniaLove A post shared by Gabrielle Union-Wade (@gabunion) on Oct 27, 2019 at 1:50pm PDT\n\nBut if the photo wasn\u2019t enough to trigger some serious nostalgia, maybe the adorable mother-daughter video she shared will.\n\n\u201cIce Ice Ice\u2026 Its COLD asf,\u201d Union wrote.\n\nView this post on Instagram Ice Ice Ice\u2026 Its COLD asf #BringItOn #CaliforniaLove A post shared by Gabrielle Union-Wade (@gabunion) on Oct 27, 2019 at 1:52pm PDT\n\nKaavia is Gabrielle\u2019s adorable daughter that she welcomed with husband Dwayne Wade via surrogate 11 months ago.\n\nThe adorable duo dressed up for Gabrielle\u2019s 46th birthday party, which had a perfectly fitting \u201cCalifornia love\u201d theme. I don\u2019t know about you, but that sounds like a great excuse for chucking on a Clovers unform, and at 46-years-old, Gabrielle Union is still ON FIRE.\n\nIt was just a few months ago that co-star Kirsten Dunst said she\u2019d be down for a Bring It On reboot, so maybe this is Gabrielle\u2019s way of hinting that she\u2019s keen too?\n\n\u201cIf they wanted to make another movie, I would make another movie. Why not?\u201d Kirsten told Kelly Clarkson in an interview.\n\nYeah, Universal. WHY! NOT!?!\n\nThe Bring It On gods have already given us a slew of excellent straight-to-video sequels including the beloved Bring It On: All or Nothing starring my queen Hayden Panettiere, but surely they can do us another favour and give us one more? Just one. I\u2019m begging you.
