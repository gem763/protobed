Those with ROHHAD may also suffer from severe respiratory issues.\n\n\"Children with ROHHAD appear to have normal growth, development, and general health prior to the onset of symptoms,\" the information center states. \"The cause of ROHHAD is currently unknown. Treatment varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.\"\n\nMAN HAS 4-INCH'DEVIL HORN' REMOVED FROM HEAD\n\nBanner weighs 70 pounds, which SWNS reports is nearly twice as much as an average child his age.\n\nBanner\u2019s mom, Lyndsay, a hairstylist, of West Warwick, told South West News Service (SWNS), a British news agency, that she first started to notice her son\u2019s weight gain in February of last year \u2014 specifically after a nasty bout with influenza A.\n\n\u201cHe was 29 pounds at that point and completely average weight,\" she recalled. \"It was almost as if he gained six pounds overnight. His clothing was suddenly tight. I became panicked. I threw out all the junk food and looked forward to an appointment with an endocrinologist at the end of April.\u201d\n\nThe endocrinologist Lyndsay took Banner to reportedly told the mom her son\u2019s weight gain was linked to his diet. But Lyndsay said she had a feeling this wasn\u2019t the case.\n\n\u201cI knew this change in Banner wasn\u2019t down to Wendy\u2019s once a week and an hour watching TV at night,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I placed my trust in her because she was a doctor and I made efforts to clean up our lifestyle.\u201d\n\nThe lifestyle changes didn\u2019t seem to help--Banner continued to gain weight. By the next month, the young boy\u2019s weight had increased by about 10 pounds.\n\nLyndsay noticed her son also was having trouble breathing, especially when he was sleeping.\n\n\u201cI began to notice that when he was sleeping, he would skip a breath every three breaths,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWe had an appointment with our hematologist in June and when she saw us in the waiting room her face dropped. She was shocked and worried about Banner\u2019s weight gain.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe immediately recommended we go to another endocrinologist and rushed us to the top of the list,\u201d said Lyndsay.\n\nShortly after, Banner was diagnosed with ROHHAD. He\u2019s primarily receiving treatment for the condition at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, according to SWNS.\n\nBanner gains weight each time his immune system is compromised, according to the outlet.\n\nLast September, he was hospitalized for six months after contracting a viral infection.\n\n\u201cLast September, I heard Banner wake up and thought he was having a bad dream,\" his mother said. \" I wasn\u2019t going to get up but then I heard him wheezing. When I went into his room he was blue and unresponsive. He was rushed to the ER by ambulance. He started seizing and hyperventilating. He stopped breathing.\"\n\n\"With his condition, he can\u2019t regulate his heartbeat or his breathing like a normal person. Even something like a common cold can be very dangerous for Banner and it progresses his condition,\u201d she added.\n\nROHHAD patients are more likely to develop certain types of tumors. Banner has undergone one surgery to remove a tumor, Lyndsay said. Afterward, he was administered chemotherapy to help delay the onset of his condition, resulting in hair loss.\n\nIn December 2018, Banner was also fitted for a permanent trach tube \u201cwhich has helped ensure he is getting enough oxygen,\u201d his mom said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s super strong. He\u2019s really determined and stubborn like his mom.\" \u2014 Banner's mom, Lyndsay\n\n\"It was a decision we had to make after a surgery he had to address a tumor. He could no longer breathe effectively on his own after it and we needed him to be properly ventilated.\u201d\n\nLyndsay said Banner has been mocked because of his condition, and some people \u2014 namely adults \u2014 have made cruel comments and gestures to her son.\n\n\u201cWhen we were trick-or-treating last October one of the houses refused to give him candy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was mind-blowing to me that anyone could treat a child like that.\u201d\n\nBOY'S E. COLI-LINKED DEATH TRACED TO SUPERMARKET BURGER HE ATE NEARLY A DECADE AGO\n\nAdded Lyndsay: \u201cHe\u2019s just a little kid and he doesn\u2019t understand, which is lucky, but people are just unbelievably cruel.\u201d\n\nThough Lyndsay said her family has been \u201cdealt a devastating card,\u201d they make sure to \u201ctake every day as it comes.\"\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s super strong. He\u2019s really determined and stubborn like his mom,\" said Lyndsay. \u201c[He] is such an amazing little boy and I want him to have the best life possible.\u201d\n\nAs for the prognosis, the Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center says \u201cthe long-term outlook for people with ROHHAD varies.\"\n\nIt continues: \"Children who are diagnosed early and appropriately managed can have a good quality of life.\"", "description": "A Rhode Island mom recently opened up about her son\u2019s rare and life-threatening condition that causes him to gain weight at an abnormal pace \u2014 and the cruelty he has faced as a result.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Banner'S Mom", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
