I couldn't take it any longer.\"\n\nHe claims he hit Ekaterina in the neck and chest area with a knife at least five times, and says he regrets what happened and promises to cooperate with the investigation.\n\nIt is not clear whether the IT specialist had a lawyer with him when he made the video, or under what circumstances police obtained his confession.\n\nIn court, Gareyev claimed Ekaterina was a prostitute who charged 10,000 rubles (\u00a3120) an hour, and admitted to using the services of \"hundreds\" of sex workers.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nThey had nicknamed him 'Ken' because of all the plastic surgery he'd had to improve his looks, he told the court.\n\nAsked if he loved Ekaterina, Gareyev said \"of course not\", adding that he had only met her twice in his life.\n\nHe claimed the influencer had mocked his sexual performance and his debts, telling him she wouldn't make him a coffee and that he would have to save up for months to visit her again.\n\n\"I lost control. I grabbed a knife in the kitchen,\" Gareyev said.\n\n\"She half turned and I struck her\u2026.in the neck. She tried to escape to the bathroom and lock the door. I pulled her out of the bathroom.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"Her blood was dripping\u2026 Then in the corridor she started screaming. I covered her mouth\u2026 I stabbed her again, to her chest with a knife.\"\n\nHe went on: \"She ran to the living room and started fighting me, but I was in a state that I didn't feel pain.\n\n\"During the fight she fell down and I struck her twice again\u2026in the neck\u2026 She had convulsions and died.\"\n\nGareyev, who held his face in his hands in court because he \"looked bad\", insisted the murder was not premeditated.\n\n\"I want to apologise to Katya's parents. I am very sorry,\" he told the Instagram star's family before he was jailed.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nIn the wake of her murder, Ekaterina has racked up 30,000 more followers to her Katti_Loves_Life Instagram.\n\nHer very last post, published on July 22, spoke of her love for travelling after she'd returned from the Greek island of Corfu.\n\n\"It was very helpful for a few days to escape from heavy rains and cold to the Ionian Sea,\" she had captioned the snap of herself holding a glass of wine by a pool.\n\n\"Now I prefer to travel very often, but briefly, study and work do not let go. But the impressions of such short trips remain the most vivid.\"", "description": "Russian travel influencer Ekaterina Karaglanova was found dead inside her own suitcase in July - and a man later confessed to her brutal murder", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Instagram", "Cen", "Maxthecheater"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20713721.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Ekaterina-Karaglanova.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
