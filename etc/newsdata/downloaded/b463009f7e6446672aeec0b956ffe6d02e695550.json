Graham: The whistle-blower\u2019s explosive allegations\n\nThat standoff was ultimately resolved in Congress\u2019s favor. Nixon turned over the tapes, and soon after resigned. Legal experts expect that Trump would fare no better in the courts\u2014he hasn\u2019t this week\u2014but he may hope to stall out investigations until it\u2019s too late for Democrats to do anything. It\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s worked for him before.\n\nEven before Cipollone\u2019s letter, constitutional experts said Trump\u2019s attempts at stonewalling were baseless.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any power to have this. It\u2019s just a flat defiance of an obvious congressional authority,\u201d Frank Bowman III, a professor of law at the University of Missouri and author of a recent book on impeachment, told me. \u201cThe House has the power to inquire into facts that would support an impeachment. The president simply has no authority to refuse to produce those facts.\u201d\n\nMichael Gerhardt, a law professor at the University of North Carolina and a nationally recognized expert on impeachment, agreed that Trump had no grounds for blocking testimony. \u201cHe is playing politics and nothing but politics, though the law is clear: No privilege precludes an ambassador or any other official from talking about legal violations and abuse of power,\u201d Gerhardt said in an email.\n\nIndeed, though the letter is signed by the White House\u2019s top lawyer, its arguments are predominantly political rather than legal. In the first section of the letter, Cipollone lays out a few arguments based in law. He notes that the House has not held a vote to officially open an impeachment inquiry, which is true but largely beside the point; there\u2019s no legal requirement to hold a vote at this stage. Cipollone also complains that Trump has not been given sufficient opportunity to defend himself or respond to charges, and that this violates due process.\n\nThe problem for Trump is that the Constitution is minimal but direct on the matter of impeachment, leaving the rules to the House to set. If the House were to vote to impeach Trump without offering him a chance to defend himself, it would raise political question of fairness\u2014but the House is only in a fact-gathering stage, trying to interview witnesses and collect information, and hasn\u2019t even drafted articles of impeachment, which would come to a vote.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump is panicking.\n\nCipollone argues that House Republicans should have subpoena power, saying that minority parties had that power during the Nixon and Clinton impeachments\u2014but in both cases, minority subpoenas would have been subject to a vote by full committee, which gave the majority a de facto veto.\n\nFinally, the letter argues that executive privilege allows Trump to prevent testimony. But, as Bowman noted, Nixon v. United States concluded that the president can\u2019t invoke executive privilege to withhold evidence in a criminal case\u2014a precedent that would probably apply to impeachment as well. \u201cIt\u2019s clear as such a thing can be that a president cannot exercise executive privilege to bar the House from getting information necessary to exercise its impeachment power,\u201d he said.", "description": "A letter from the president\u2019s lawyer argues that the House probe is illegitimate, but its claims are more political than legal.", "authors": ["David A.
