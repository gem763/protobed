But the competitions committee rejected that idea, saying that it was against its rules to invert the order of the games.\n\nThe federation, in consultation with government officials, said it wasn\u2019t safe to play on the same day as the rally.\n\nThe Spanish league runs the top two soccer divisions in the country, while the federation controls regulations and matches for professional and amateur games.\n\nCatalonia has seen violent protests for the last few days with police clashing with protesters angered by a supreme court decision to sentence nine separatist leaders to prison. Separatist groups have called for supporters to rally in Barcelona on 26 October, the original date of the match. There appear to have been fears that protests could again get out of hand and make access difficult to the Camp Nou.\n\nCatalan independence flags are a regular feature at Barcelona\u2019s home games, as are collective shouts for \u201cindependence\u201d by separatist supporters.
