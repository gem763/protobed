Click here to learn more about the global movement fighting for our future.\n\nAbout five years ago, I started eating meat. My parents are veteran vegetarians, so I grew up on a meat-free diet. I never really developed a taste for meat as a kid \u2013 it wasn\u2019t until I was in my late twenties and really getting into food and cooking that I started broadening my gastronomical horizons to include the joys of the (literal) flesh.\n\nBut this new dietary expansion brought with it a conundrum. As the planet hurtles towards climate apocalypse, it\u2019s become common knowledge that a meat-based diet is one of the biggest contributors to global warming.\n\nAgriculture, particularly factory farming, contributes tonnes of methane to the atmosphere, and sucks up shocking amounts of resources \u2013 it\u2019s estimated that one kilo of meat can require between 5,000 and 20,000 litres of water to produce. According to research from 2016, if everyone in the world switched to a plant-based diet, we\u2019d cut greenhouse emissions by two thirds.\n\nMeat production, on the whole, is also a profoundly inhumane industry.\n\nIn Australia, 90% of pigs and most chickens raised for human consumption are kept in factory farming conditions \u2013 cramped, unhygienic, distressing environments where they are unable to act upon natural instincts to nest, forage, roost, and reproduce. It does not feel good to contribute to the needless suffering of the approximately 70 billion farm animals currently being raised for slaughter, just because I really, really like salami.\n\nVeganism is the fastest-growing diet worldwide, with most adherents citing the above reasons \u2013 global warming and ethics \u2013 for their switch to a plant-based lifestyle. And excitingly, the market is responding to the call for good meat alternatives, with a whole bunch of extremely palatable replacements for animal protein hitting supermarket shelves worldwide.\n\nThat being said, though, veganism is not the ultimate solution. Putting aside the fact that demands for soy protein cause mass deforestation in order to make space for monoculture plantations that in turn reduce biodiversity and put pressure on pollinators, it\u2019s a dietary restriction that for many people can feel too extreme, too expensive, and too time consuming \u2013 and once something\u2019s in the \u201ctoo hard\u201d box, it becomes real easy to ignore it altogether.\n\nSo how can you approach being an omnivore in a more ethical and sustainable way, if you don\u2019t want to completely ditch meat from your diet?\n\nIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve been thinking about for pretty much the last five years, and here\u2019s a list I\u2019ve come up with to eat ethical meat.\n\n1. Eat Less Of It\n\nThe mainstream Australian diet is still firmly founded on a big serving of meat, three times a day. Bacon and eggs for breakfast, meat pie for lunch, steak and three veg for dinner? An ideal balanced menu, according to like 80% of the population!\n\nBut simply replacing two meals a day \u2013 or a couple days a week \u2013 with vegetarian options cuts your meat consumption, and therefore your farming-related carbon footprint, down by a huge amount.\n\n2. Eat All Of It\n\nI\u2019m talking organ meat, y\u2019all! Our meat-eating practices have become increasingly wasteful as we\u2019ve become pickier about the cuts we eat. Fortunately a bunch of food influencers (sorry for using that word) have popularised nose-to-tail ethical meat eating, and there are a bunch of excellent recipes for \u201cvariety meats\u201d (organs, ears, heads\u2026 you get the gist) that both taste delicious and soothe your sense of responsibility.\n\nPlus, these cuts tend to have a bunch more nutritional value than more standard hunks of meat, and because you\u2019ll need to head to your local butcher to get them, you\u2019ll be supporting local businesses and the farms that supply them, too.\n\n3. Eat Wisely\n\nSpeaking of suppliers \u2013 if you\u2019re cutting back on eating meat every day, then you should be able to afford getting choosy with who you buy your cuts from.\n\nThis is a great list of ethical farmers who raise their animals humanely. Check out your local farmers market and ask the stallholders questions about how they raise their animals, and purchase accordingly. You might be paying $25 for a couple hundred grams of bacon, but it\u2019s gonna be the best damn bacon you ever had, and you can feel good about buying it.\n\n4. Eat The Problem\n\nThis is my personal approach to ethical meat eating: I\u2019m talking game, baby. I\u2019m fortunate enough to live in Tasmania, where wallaby and roo meat is very popular and widely available, along with deer, rabbit, and (depending on the season) the deliciously weird and fatty muttonbird.\n\nDeer and rabbits are obviously pest species and you should feel absolutely no remorse about chowing down on a slow-cooked shoulder of venison (chuck some apples in, it\u2019s the bomb). Eating our national symbols, though \u2013 kangaroos and wallabies \u2013 can cause a bit more of a reaction for lots of people.\n\nI spoke to Michael Coleman from Tandara Game Meats, my local supplier, about his reasons for getting into the wallaby meat market.\n\nIn Tassie, as in many rural places around Australia, farmers cull wallabies and roos on their properties because they eat crops and pasture, damage fences, and cause a bunch of mischief all round. Wallabies and roos are in no way endangered \u2013 they are, after all, perfectly adapted to live in Australia, unlike sheep and cattle \u2013 and culling by shooting is far preferable to poisoning, as the poison can work its way through the food chain and kill quolls, Tasmanian devils, and carrion eaters.\n\nThe problem was that the culled animals were being left in the field, and Michael hates to see waste.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any animal deserves to die unless it\u2019s being utilised,\u201d he told me. \u201cSo instead of leaving the waste on the ground, we decided to utilise it.\u201d\n\nThat was ten years ago, and since then, Tandara has grown a healthy customer base just via word of mouth. Michael\u2019s customers come to him for wallaby, rabbit and venison, citing the meat\u2019s high sustainability and lower cost compared to beef and pork.\n\nAnother bonus of eating game: the meat itself is bloody great.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got no hormones, no additives, it\u2019s all natural, it\u2019s very lean. It\u2019s a lot better meat because it\u2019s culled in the paddock, and it\u2019s not put under stress by going through to a slaughterhouse. It\u2019s put down very quickly and the meat is a better product because of that.\u201d\n\nWallaby sausages, steaks, roasts and burgers all beat their traditional cow counterparts hands-down, as far as I\u2019m concerned, and I\u2019m not alone. Michael reckons more and more people are switching to native and game meats, and the future of the Australian diet is already shifting.\n\nDon\u2019t live as rurally as I do? The good news is, wallaby and roo meat is readily available in supermarkets nationally.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re still on the fence about incorporating our furry national emblems into your ethical meat eating, keep Michael\u2019s advice in mind: \u201cJust try it.\u201d It could make a world of difference.", "description": "Becoming an ethical meat eater isn't as hard as you might think.
