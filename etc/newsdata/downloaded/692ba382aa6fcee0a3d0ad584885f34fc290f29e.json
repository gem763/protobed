He currently leads Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who has the support of 35 per cent of the Italian public.\n\nHead of the right-wing party The Brothers of Italy, Giorgia Melonile, came in at third, with 29 per cent saying they trusted her.\n\nThe poll conducted by Agor\u00e0, an Italian current affairs show, also showed that Salvini\u2019s populist League remained the most popular party, with 31.8 per cent supporting.\n\nBoth parties comprising the current left-wing coalition government in Italy, the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party, polled under 20 per cent.\n\nTens of thousands gathered on Saturday for an \u201cItalian Pride\u201d rally in Rome that saw Salvini joined by Giorgia Melonile and former prime minister and head of the Forza Italia party, Silvio Berlusconi.\n\nAddressing his supporters, Salvini said: \u201cThis is the Italy that works and suffers, that dreams and hopes.\u201d\n\nAs supporters shouted her name from the piazza, Melonile said: \u201cWe are people. And we have our identity. I am Giorgia, I am a woman, I am a mother, I am Italian, and I am Christian, and you cannot take that away from me.\u201d\n\nA 61-year-old woman who attended the rally said to the Associated Press: \u201cWe ask Matteo (Salvini) to lead us to the polls as soon as possible. And once we\u2019ll be finally allowed to vote, we\u2019ll win big.\u201d\n\nIf Salvini, Melonile, and Berlusconi\u2019s respective parties strike an alliance, pollsters believe they would easily have enough support to gain control of the Italian parliament in the next election.", "description": "A recent poll found that former Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini is the most trusted Italian politician.", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Matteo-Salvini-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
