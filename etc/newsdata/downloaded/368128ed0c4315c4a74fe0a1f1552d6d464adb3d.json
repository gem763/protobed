I went outside to try and help him and took a broom and a piece of bread but he knocked the broom out of my hand then attacked me,\" Smith said.\n\nThe 64-year-old managed to get the roo off her husband and grabbed a piece of wood to defend herself, while her 40-year-old son \"came out to try and help me and hit him over the head with a shovel\".\n\nThe kangaroo then hopped off back into the bush, Queensland Ambulance Service's senior operations supervisor Stephen Jones said, adding that the attack was \"rare\".\n\n'An act of nature'\n\n\"They are known to attack and can be quite vicious, particularly the large males. But it is something that is uncommon, something that I haven't come across in my 30-odd years in the service,\" Jones told AFP.\n\nHe added that if Smith had not intervened to help her husband, who suffered multiple cuts and abrasions to his arms, chest and legs, he could have suffered more serious injuries and \"the outcome may have even been death\".\n\nSmith, who said she has been a wildlife carer for 15 years, added that she did not want the marsupial to be hunted down and killed.\n\nCalling what happened \"an act of nature\", Smith said she was always aware she was dealing with wildlife.\n\n\"I am always careful, especially of the males. It's breeding time so they can be more aggressive. I don't want this kangaroo to be hunted down and killed, I love animals,\" she added.\n\n\"I do understand what happened but I have never seen one that aggressive \u2013 it was in there for a fight and it wouldn't back off.\"\n\nThere are more than 46 million kangaroos across Australia, according to a government count last year, but conservationists warn that population numbers are falling amid a long drought in the vast continent's east.", "description": "Three members of an Australian family used a broom and a shovel to fight off a rare attack by a large kangaroo that has left all of them injured, one seriously.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5284/b5055d3f0f5c4ee4854f42556317fb59.png", "published_at": "2018-10-14"}
