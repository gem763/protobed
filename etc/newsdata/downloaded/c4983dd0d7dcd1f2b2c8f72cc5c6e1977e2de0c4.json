Ilhan Omar \u2014 one of his favorite Democratic foils in Congress, whose district includes Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cThe lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cDump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again!\u201d\n\nFrey responded an hour later, quoting Trump\u2019s message and tweeting: \u201cYawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors.\u201d\n\nBut the president kept bludgeoning the mayor on social media, referencing a \u201cFox & Friends\u201d segment on a newly introduced policy by the Minneapolis Police Department that bans officers from appearing in uniform in support of candidates at political events or in advertisements.\n\nLt. Bob Kroll, president of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis, had appeared on the morning cable news show earlier Tuesday to promote the union\u2019s \u201cCops for Trump\u201d T-shirts for officers to wear instead.\n\n\u201cThe Police are fighting the Radical Left Mayor, and his ridiculous Uniform Ban. Actually, I LOVE the Cops for Trump shirts. Want to bring some home. I am with you 100%!!!!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\n\u201cSomeone please tell the Radical Left Mayor of Minneapolis that he can\u2019t price out Free Speech. Probably illegal!\u201d he added. \u201cI stand strongly & proudly with the great Police Officers and Law Enforcement of Minneapolis and the Great State of Minnesota! See you Thursday Night!\u201d\n\nFrey retorted to that post, as well, tweeting: \u201cSomeone tell the President of the United States that he can afford to help pay for the extra time our officers will be putting in while he\u2019s in town.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/31/66/cf0109074a5d986117197f6e70b1/191008-hacob-frey-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
