They\u2019re also tracking whether you\u2019ve opened the email, when you opened it, and where you were at the time by using software like MailChimp to embed tracking software into the message.\n\nHow does it work? A single tracking pixel is embedded into the email, usually (but not always) hidden within an image or a link. When the email is opened, code within the pixel sends the info back to the company\u2019s server.\n\nThere have been some attempts to restrict the amount of information that can be transmitted this way. For example, since 2014, Google has served all images through its own proxy servers, which could hide your location from at least some tracking applications. And extensions such as Ugly Mail and PixelBlock have been developed to block trackers on Chrome and Firefox.\n\nThere is also a simple basic step you can take to avoid trackers: stop your email from automatically loading images since images are where the majority of these pixels hide. You won\u2019t be able to avoid all of the trackers that can hide in your email this way, but you will stop many of them.\n\nHere\u2019s how to do it in the major desktop and mobile email apps:\n\nDisable image autoloading in Gmail:\n\nClick on the gear icon in the upper right corner to access your settings\n\nIn the \u201cGeneral\u201d tab (the first one), scroll down to \u201cImages\u201d\n\nSelect \u201cAsk before displaying external images\u201d\n\nScroll down to the bottom of the page and click on \u201cSave Changes\u201d\n\nNote that this will also turn off Gmail\u2019s dynamic email feature, which makes emails more interactive.\n\nDisable image autoloading in Microsoft Outlook (Office 365):\n\nClick on \u201cFile\u201d > \u201cOptions\u201d\n\nIn the \u201cOutlook Options\u201d window, select \u201cTrust Center\u201d\n\nClick on the \u201cTrust Center Settings\u201d button\n\nCheck the boxes labeled \u201cDon\u2019t download pictures automatically in standard HTML messages or RSS items\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t download pictures in encrypted or signed HTML email messages.\u201d You can make a number of exceptions to the first item if you want by checking the boxes underneath it.\n\nDisable image autoloading in Microsoft Mail:\n\nClick on the gear icon on the bottom left\n\nFrom the \u201cSettings\u201d menu on the right, select \u201cReading pane\u201d\n\nAt the bottom of the menu on the right, turn off \u201cAutomatically download external images and style formats except S/MIME Mail\u201d and \u201cAutomatically download external images and style formats for S/MIME Mail\u201d\n\nIf you are using Mail with more than one email account, make sure \u201cApply to all accounts\u201d is checked\n\nDisable image autoloading in Apple Mail:\n\nSelect \u201cMail\u201d > \u201cPreferences\u201d\n\nClick on the \u201cViewing\u201d tab\n\nUncheck \u201cLoad remote content in messages\u201d\n\nDisable image autoloading in Android / iOS Gmail:\n\nTap on the three lines in the upper left corner\n\nScroll down to and select \u201cSettings\u201d\n\nTap on the email account that you want to work with\n\nScroll down to and select \u201cImages\u201d\n\nTap on \u201cAsk before displaying external images\u201d\n\nAs of September 3rd, 2019, Google has added the setting to the iOS version of Gmail as well.
