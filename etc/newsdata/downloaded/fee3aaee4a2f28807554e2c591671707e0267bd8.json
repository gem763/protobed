Right: One of the black hooded men puts piles of the stolen goods into the boot of the car\n\nAmong the things stolen are what looks like a pile of black jeans still on the hangers.\n\nWhen the men have taken what they want, two jump in the front seats as the final man pushes the last items into the boot and gets in the back.\n\nThe car then speeds away through the busy car park.\n\nAn eyewitness said: 'I was outside and a red car reversed into a car parking space outside the shop. Some men got out. They left all the doors open and opened the boot.\n\n'Four men charged into the shop. They were all dressed in black hoodies and one had a crowbar and one had a machete.\n\nThe group of men left all the doors open and opened the boot as they made journeys to and from the store\n\nWhen the men have taken what they want, two jump in the front seats as the final man pushes the last items into the boot and gets in the back (pictured)\n\n'As they were coming back towards the car an old man asked them what they were doing and they threatened him with the machete.\n\n'They went in and out about three times, and on the last time they came they had a till.\n\n'I was quite shocked, it didn't seem real, you only see stuff like this on Crimewatch.\n\n'I was quite scared but just kept my distance.\n\n'I went into the shop afterwards and the staff were very scared and in shock.'\n\nA West Midlands Police spokesman said: 'Police are investigating reports of a robbery at a shop in Crown Wharf Retail Park, Wolverhampton Street, Walsall at 2.15pm today (14 October).\n\n'It is believed a group of masked men armed with weapons ran into the store before taking the contents of the till and items from the shop.\n\n'Fortunately, no one was injured.
