Other agencies, such as the Hong Kong Office of the Ombudsman and the Independent Police Complaint Council, lack the powers needed to conduct thorough investigations.\n\n\u201cThe current trust crisis makes it difficult for citizens to believe that the police officers breaching the law would receive appropriate punishment,\u201d NOPAID argued.\n\nThe bulk of the report consists of photos and videos documenting reported police abuses, with each incident classified by whether it violated the statutory guidelines on the use of police force, obstructed journalists, hindered medical assistance to the injured, or was conducted without the police displaying a proper warrant.\n\nNOPAID also noted when the police treated Hong Kong citizens rudely, which they once had a good reputation for avoiding thanks to a strict code of conduct. Hong Kong police regulations also require officers to actively \u201cfacilitate the work of the news media as much as possible and accord media representatives consideration and courtesy.\u201d\n\nThe archive of evidence in the report runs back to June 10 and currently fills about 250 pages of Google Documents. NOPAID argued the conduct of the police during the current crisis has \u201cseverely shaken the foundation of the rule of law, and eroded the public confidence in the \u2018One Country, Two Systems\u2019 principle and the Basic Law.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo restore effective governance and to prevent recurrence of such incidents, a holistic political reform and universal suffrage for the CE and Legislative Council elections are still topics that cannot be avoided,\u201d the group concluded, a more formal way of saying that all of the protest movement\u2019s \u201cFive Demands\u201d should be met.\n\nSome protesters have recently begun speaking of a \u201cSixth Demand,\u201d the complete disbanding of the HKPF as currently constituted. NOPAID told Breitbart News that while they believe drastic reforms are needed, \u201cdisbanding the police force may not be the best immediate solution,\u201d but discussions should be held to determine how reforms can best be implemented.\n\n\u201cThis is outside the scope of the report, and more research is definitely needed,\u201d they said.\n\nNOPAID told Breitbart News its members have been individually active, but the Police Force Investigation Report is the first time they have worked together as a group.\n\n\u201cWe met on the internet, through LiHKG and Facebook. We are not an organization with a clear structure, but we all care about the excessive power of the police force,\u201d they said. LiHKG is an online forum similar to Reddit that is popular with protesters.\n\nNOPAID noted that as a volunteer group of citizens, it lacks the resources of a major journalistic organization and the statutory authority to conduct the kind of thorough investigation of the police force that Hong Kong desperately needs.\n\n\u201cThis report serves as a starting point for further investigation, and we hope that investigative journalists will pursue further investigation and reporting,\u201d NOPAID told Breitbart News.", "description": "A Hong Kong group called NOPAID this week published an extensive report on the excessive use of force by police against protesters.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/hong-kong-arrest-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
