REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\n\nDavid Marcus, who heads the Libra project for Facebook, told a banking seminar the group\u2019s main goal remained to create a more efficient payments system, but it was open to looking at alternative approaches for the currency token it would use.\n\n\u201cWe could do it differently,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of having a synthetic unit ... we could have a series of stablecoins, a dollar stablecoin, a euro stablecoin, a sterling pound stable coin, etc,\u201d Marcus told the panel.\n\n\u201cWe could definitely approach this with having a multitude of stablecoins that represent national currencies in a tokenized digital form,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is one of the options that should be considered.\u201d\n\nMarcus said he was not suggesting currency-pegged stablecoins were the group\u2019s new preferred option.\n\n\u201cWhat we care about is the mission and there are a number ways to go about this,\u201d Marcus told Reuters after the panel, adding that the Libra needed to \u201cdemonstrate a lot of agility.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook-led project suffered severe setbacks earlier this month, as major payment companies Mastercard Inc (MA.N) and Visa Inc (V.N) became the latest partners to quit the group behind the project.\n\nOther key members that have pulled out included Stripe, eBay Inc (EBAY.O) and Booking Holdings Inc (BKNG.O) and PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O).\n\nGlobal policymakers and regulators have also worry that creation of a new synthetic global currency could upend the global financial system, threaten users\u2019 privacy, and facilitate money laundering.\n\nGroup of 20 finance leaders on Friday agreed to set strict regulations on cryptocurrencies and said such stablecoins should not be issued until various global risks were addressed.\n\nMarcus told Reuters that Facebook was still aiming for a June 2020 launch of Libra, but acknowledged it could miss that target due to regulatory hurdles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see. That\u2019s still the goal,\u201d Marcus told Reuters when asked if the recent departure of several major partners from the project would delay the planned 2020 launch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always said that we wouldn\u2019t go forward unless we have addressed all legitimate concerns and get proper regulatory approval. So it\u2019s not entirely up to us,\u201d he said.", "description": "Facebook Inc , facing growing skepticism about its digital currency project Libra, on Sunday said the initiative could use cryptocurrencies based on national currencies such as the dollar, instead of the synthetic one it initially proposed.", "authors": ["Andrea Shalal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443217534&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0NU", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
