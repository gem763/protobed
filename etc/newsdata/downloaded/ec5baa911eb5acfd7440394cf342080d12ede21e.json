One of the main things to look out for is the progression from gentle nursery slopes to longer runs that allow you to practise your technique without throwing you in at the deep end.\n\nSome resorts have very little to offer between the nearly flat baby slopes and the more demanding pistes that might be classified as blue (easy) but in reality are quite challenging to a newbie. You\u2019ll also want to be able to ski at altitude rather than being stuck at village level, plus look out for resorts that offer free beginner lifts. If you want a taste of skiing, these are some of the best beginner ski resorts in Europe.\n\nThe Independent\u2019s ski recommendations are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.

You\u2019ll find superb nursery slopes at Courchevel 1650 and Courchevel 1850, and the move to longer blue runs is an easy one.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

With the jagged peak of Monte Cervino to gaze at, you have high, wide slopes to progress to once you\u2019ve mastered the village slopes. If you whizz to intermediate level, you can even ski across the border to Zermatt.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nInghams has seven nights\u2019 chalet board at Chalet Hotel Dragon in Cervinia from \u00a3999pp, including flights and transfers, departing 18 January.\n\nMontgen\u00e8vre, France\n\nThe only French ski resort in the mainly Italian Milky Way, Montgen\u00e8vre also has the most varied skiing. Beginners are in for a treat once they get up to speed on the village nursery slopes \u2013 they can then move to beautiful high-altitude green and blue runs at the top of Les Gondrans. And the prospect of walking into Italy for lunch is too tempting to resist.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nPeak Retreats has a week\u2019s self-catering in a one-bedroom apartment at the four-star Hameau des Airelles residence from \u00a3798, including Eurotunnel crossing, for January departures.\n\nAlpe-d\u2019Huez, France\n\nWhile many ski resorts reserve the best views for more competent skiers, that\u2019s not the case in Alpe d\u2019Huez. This high-altitude resort has some of the most uplifting ski slopes for beginners \u2013 mainly because there\u2019s a large network of green slopes that go up to 2,109m.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nNeilson has a week\u2019s chalet board at the Chalet Hotel Escapade from \u00a3779pp, including flights and transfers, departing 4 January.\n\nLa Rosi\u00e8re, France\n\nLa Rosi\u00e8re doesn\u2019t get the attention that its bigger neighbour across the valley, Les Arcs, does, but its intimate atmosphere is one of its strong points. So are its sunny south-facing slopes that lead down to the main village and the laid-back hamlet of Les Eucherts. Intermediates who have gained a bit of confidence can ski across the border to La Thuile in Italy.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nSki Solutions has a week\u2019s chalet board from \u00a3600pp at Chalet Papillon 1, including flights and transfers, for an 11 January departure.\n\nLa Plagne, France\n\nWith about 10 villages dotted throughout La Plagne, there are plenty of places to learn, and most come with free beginner lifts. Plagne Centre is the focus, with the other villages scattered above and below it. Beginners have a large number of very good nursery slopes to start with, and the progression to long blue runs is an easy one. There\u2019s also a cable car that links the village of Montchavin to the neighbouring Paradiski resort of Les Arcs.\n\nStaying there\n\nAlpine Elements has a week\u2019s chalet board at Chalet Capella in Plagne 1800 from \u00a3776pp, including flights and transfers, for a 5 January departure.\n\nValloire, France\n\nThis small village in the Maurienne Valley combines warm Savoyard charm with some excellent slopes for novices, including a lovely long green run that winds through the woods. You\u2019ll also find beginner slopes at close to 2,600m, offering wonderful views of the Maurienne Valley.\n\nStaying there\n\nPeak Retreats has a week\u2019s self-catering in the Chalets d\u2019Adrien luxury apartments in the village centre for \u00a3996, including Eurotunnel crossing, for a 4 January departure.\n\nSaalbach, Austria\n\nIf you\u2019ve always wondered what the fuss is about with apr\u00e8s-ski, this boisterous Austrian resort will introduce you to all its raucous pleasures. But knuckle down with the skiing first, where nursery slopes are divided between Saalbach and its near neighbour Hinterglemm. The whole area is now part of the catchily named Skicircus Saalbach Hinterglemm Leogang Fieberbrunn ski domain, of which 140km of its 270km pistes are for beginners.\n\nStaying there\n\nIgluski.com has a week\u2019s B&B at the Pension Schattberg from \u00a3574pp, departing 4 January, including flights and transfers.\n\nAvoriaz, France\n\nTraffic-free streets give this purpose-built resort a cosy feel, and its altitude gives it a good snow record. Once you\u2019ve mastered the nursery slopes, it\u2019s a straightforward progression to much longer slopes \u2013 as well as the huge terrain available at the other resorts within the Portes du Soleil domain.\n\nStaying there\n\nPierre & Vacances has a week\u2019s self-catering in a one-bedroom apartment at Residence l\u2019Hermine from \u00a3585 for 11 January.\n\nSaas-Fee, Switzerland\n\nYou don\u2019t have be a Wham! fan to fall under Saas-Fee\u2019s spell (the resort served as the backdrop to the band\u2019s \u201cLast Christmas\u201d video). Tons of snow at high altitude \u2013 plus an attractive village \u2013 make this Swiss resort an appealing option for beginners. There are plenty of long blue runs to progress to once you\u2019ve honed your skills on the large nursery area, and even some of the reds are gentle enough to give you a confidence boost.\n\nStaying there\n\nInghams has a week\u2019s self-catering at Allalin Apartments from \u00a3665pp departing 4 January, including flights and rail transfers from Zurich.", "description": "If you\u2019ve been enviously watching your family and friends skiing and finally fancy a go yourself, you\u2019ll need to choose your ski resort carefully.
