Scientists found microplastics \u2013 most of which were from clothing fibres \u2013 in reasonable quantities in all layers of the core after 1945.\n\n\u201cOur love of plastic is actually being left behind in our fossil record,\u201d Dr Brandon told The Guardian. \u201dThis study shows that our plastic production is being almost perfectly copied in our sedimentary record.\u201d\n\nScientists found that by 2010, people were depositing 10 times as much plastic in the basin as they were before the Second World War. The postwar period also showed an increase in the diversity of plastics \u2013 including plastic bag materials and plastic particles as well as fibres.\n\nThe study, published in Science Advances, is the first to look at the accumulation of plastic in one location. Researchers chose to study Santa Barbara Basin because the waters are still and there is a near total absence of oxygen, helping to preserve sedimentary layers.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In April, an explorer visited the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean \u2013 the deepest natural trench in the world \u2013 and found plastic bags.\n\nScientists estimate that between 4.8 and 12.7 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the ocean every year.\n\n\u201cOur results demonstrate that such an increase is now detectable not only in surface ocean water but also in a benthic ecosystem [the lowest level of a body of water], as recorded in the sedimentary record,\u201d researchers wrote in the paper.\n\nScientists say they \u201cpredict that this growing rate of plastic deposition will continue to increase in the future, barring marked changes in policy or waste management\u201d.\n\nEarlier this year, scientists from the Marine Biological Association and the University of Plymouth found there had been a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in larger plastic items found in the ocean from 1957 to 2016.\n\nPlastic objects such as bags, rope and netting were among those retrieved from oceans. This rubbish already causes more than \u00a310bn in economic damage to marine systems each year.\n\nIf these trends continue, marine plastic is set to outweigh fish by 2050.", "description": "Plastic pollution is now in the fossil record \u2013 a discovery that\u00a0may mean this period of time becomes\u00a0known as the plastic age,\u00a0scientists say.
