Jerry Nadler, Adam Schiff and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThese three Trump-hating malcontents have destroyed the faith the country had in the U.S. Constitution by illegally changing the rule of law in attempts to destroy our president, making him the most tortured and maligned president this country has ever seen.\n\nPresident Trump brought us back from the disastrous Obama years that killed morale with class warfare and race relations, and which set our country back to times long forgotten. We are no longer the whipping boy for other countries that lost all respect for us. And this brings me back to the three aforementioned anarchists.\n\nMr. Schiff is one of dirtiest politicians I\u2019ve ever seen. In fact, I would put him at the top of the list of all the criminals I encountered during my long career in law enforcement. He lies with impunity. He is nothing less than a diehard sociopath who has no conception of remorse or feeling for those he tortures. His so-called intelligence committee is run like a banana republic, denying the Republicans the right to confront any of his witnesses.\n\nMr. Schiff, Mr. Nadler and Mrs. Pelosi have violated numerous laws governing politicians. They have also violated their oaths of office with their unethical practices. Thus, I felt it my civic duty to file charges with two government agencies to have these three answer for their crimes against the president and the people of the United States.\n\nGREGORY J.
