(He denies the accusation.)\n\nIn Manhattan federal court on Tuesday, counsel for Giuffre and Dershowitz argued over whether the defamation suit should be dismissed\u2014despite Dershowitz\u2019s previous claims to the press that he welcomed such litigation to prove his innocence\u2014and whether Giuffre\u2019s lawyers should be disqualified from the case.\n\nDershowitz argues Giuffre\u2019s lawyer David Boies and his firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, should be booted from the case because the defense will call them as witnesses. Dershowitz claims a member of Boies\u2019 firm consulted with Dershowitz and nearly represented him in 2015 over Giuffre\u2019s allegations. He also claims to have a secret phone recording where Boies allegedly questions his own client\u2019s credibility.\n\nSend The Daily Beast a Tip\n\nEpstein Accuser Sues Alan Dershowitz Over Alleged Sex Ring\n\nBoies\u2019 firm has denied Dershowitz\u2019s interpretation of events, saying that Boies has no doubts Giuffre is telling the truth, and that he was speaking hypothetically with Dershowitz, who, he says, is taking the recording out of context.\n\nImran Ansari, a lawyer for Dershowitz, told Judge Loretta Preska that he plans to file a transcript of the recording under seal. Ansari also referred to a separate conversation relating to Wexner, prompting Judge Preska to say Wexner was \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the arguments.\n\nBut Howard Cooper, another lawyer for Dershowitz, replied that Giuffre\u2019s complaint accuses Dershowitz of making defamatory statements relating to Wexner, and that one of Dershowitz\u2019s defenses in court will be proving his claims are true. (\u201cRoberts made up the accusations out of whole cloth in order to obtain millions of dollars from Leslie Wexner,\u201d Dershowitz declared in December 2018, according to Giuffre\u2019s lawsuit.)\n\nWexner\u2019s name also came up while Dershowitz\u2019s team tried arguing that he couldn\u2019t be sued for repeating in 2018 and 2019 \u201cvirtually the same statements\u201d he made in 2015.\n\nSigrid McCawley, a lawyer for Giuffre, disagreed and told the court that Dershowitz hasn\u2019t merely been recycling his 2015 statements. Instead, she said he\u2019s elaborated on his old claims and referred to other individuals including Wexner. \u201cThese statements go well beyond his statements in 2015,\u201d she said.\n\nMcCawley argued that the law doesn\u2019t allow someone to become a \u201cserial defamer\u201d and avoid legal accountability after they\u2019ve said one bad thing about someone in the past. Every new publication of defamatory statements triggers a new statute of limitations, she said.\n\nMcCawley argued Giuffre has an actual malice claim against Dershowitz because he \u201cwent to the media and said he wanted to be sued\u201d by Giuffre. Dershowitz \u201cknew he had abused my client, then went before the public and called her a liar,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Cooper said Dershowitz has continued to call Giuffre a \u201cliar\u201d in order to defend his reputation\u2014referring to the constant stream of news relating to Dershowitz\u2019s friend and former client, wealthy sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. \u201cWhat would someone in Professor Dershowitz\u2019s position do?\u201d Cooper asked Judge Preska.\n\nAfter the proceeding, Dershowitz and his team addressed reporters outside the courthouse, where the Harvard academic claimed he was \u201cdefending not only my right but the rights of everyone who\u2019s ever been falsely accused.\u201d\n\nAsked for proof that Giuffre\u2019s claims were false, Dershowitz said, \u201cI am standing here in front of you the media and I am stating unequivocally without the protection of defamation privilege, subject to being sued for defamation, I am saying to you I never met Virginia Giuffre. I never had sex with her. And the reason I\u2019m saying it is because it\u2019s true. She on the other had\u2026 has never and will never stand in front of any media and repeat her lie saying that she did have sex with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe you. We don\u2019t believe you. Go back to your office!\u201d a woman in the crowd yelled over Dershowitz, but he was undeterred.\n\nWhen a reporter asked about the Victoria\u2019s Secret mogul, Epstein\u2019s only known client, Dershowitz replied, \u201cLes Wexner will be a major witness.\u201d", "description": "Jefferson Siegel/ReutersAlan Dershowitz is dragging Victoria\u2019s Secret mogul Les Wexner into his legal battle with Virginia Roberts Giuffre\u2014a victim of Jeffrey Epstein who claims she was coerced into sex with Dershowitz and is suing him for defamation.
