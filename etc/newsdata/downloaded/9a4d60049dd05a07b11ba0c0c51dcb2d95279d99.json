But there are not enough sane people in California to fix a state that is almost certainly beyond repair, too far gone to ever come up with the 51 percent of voters needed to put sane, grounded leaders into the state capitol. I am talking about leaders who will focus on the basics before they chase the unicorn of a green energy utopia, who are not willing to watch responsible home and business owners chased away by outrageous taxes, regulations, and fuel costs, but are willing to defy the enviro-nuts to remove the brush and trees close to power lines.\n\nEven New York City, at its worst in the seventies, was not as failed as the state of California is now.\n\nAs I write this, millions and millions of Californians, who pay outrageously high taxes, are having their electricity cut off for up to a full week because 1) Californian can afford to give illegal aliens free health care and welfare, but not bury power lines, and 2) California can waste untold billions on green energy boondoggles but refuses to upset Mother Earth by implementing proven forest management techniques.\n\nApparently Mother Earth would rather burn than receive a brush-cut.\n\nCan you imagine not having electricity for five days?\n\nI\u2019m 53-years-old, I\u2019ve lived in rural areas most my life, and the longest I\u2019ve been without power is 14 hours.\n\nOh, sure, California has all kinds of time and money to welcome, house, feed, educate, and provide for illegal aliens, but look at what is happening to the legal residents of California:\n\nPacific Gas & Electric Corp. said its latest blackout would affect about 1.5 million people in 29 counties. At the same time, about 1 million people were still without power Tuesday after a shut-off over the weekend that affected nearly 2.7 million. \u2026 Petaluma resident Scotty Richardson, whose lights went out Saturday, said the prospect that power might not be restored for days makes him \u201cfurious, furious.\u201d He vented frustration over the on-again, off-again outages but also anger at the utility\u2019s role in causing deadly fires in the past, and apparently sparking some of this season\u2019s blazes. \u201cPG&E can\u2019t figure out how to deliver power reliably without killing people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is more than three strikes \u2014 it\u2019s a failure of epic proportions.\u201d\n\nAlready, one person has been killed by these ridiculous blackouts, a 67-year-old man who was dependent on oxygen.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the most infuriating part of all this\u2026\n\nEven with these blackouts\u2026\n\nThe state is still getting hammered by deadly wildfires.\n\nBut great job California, voting in super-majorities of Democrats, so many Democrats they can get away with whatever they wish without any fear of pushback or ever losing electoral power.\n\nYou might not have any power for your air conditioner, refrigerator, and baby monitor, but you still gave Democrats unlimited political power.\n\nWhile your power is off for five days, your government is using your tax dollars to pay for a prisoner\u2019s sex change operation.\n\nNaturally, the politicians are blaming PG&E, as though those same politicians have no control over PG&E.\n\nThe hoax of Global Warming is also being blamed, as though that would be a legitimate excuse even if it were true. This is not the first time, after all, that California has been beset by drought and the Santa Ana winds. This problem reaches back decades, and here California is, knee-deep in the 21st Century, with all this wonderful technology and a third of a trillion \u2014 with a \u201cT\u201d \u2014 dollars in annual revenue, and the government still cannot keep your electricity on, still cannot stop the wildfires.\n\nIt\u2019s outrageous. Good heavens, this is the United States of America, and we have a state that can only come up with the genius idea of pushing its own citizens back into the Dark Ages to NOT stop wildfires.\n\nWhat is most discouraging, though, is the lack of anything that looks like a voter backlash.\n\nI mean, if more than 50 percent of California\u2019s citizens are willing to keep a government in power incapable of delivering the basics, if they prefer social justice over electricity\u2026 Well, that is just the most pathetic thing I\u2019ve ever seen. This is not how Americans are supposed to behave.\n\nSheeple indeed.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
