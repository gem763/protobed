(DPZ), the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales, announced results for the third quarter, comprised of growth in global retail sales and earnings per share. Global retail sales increased 5.8% in the third quarter, or 7.5% without the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. U.S. same store sales grew 2.4% during the quarter versus the prior year quarter, continuing the positive sales momentum in the Company's U.S. business. The international division also posted positive results, with same store sales growth of 1.7% during the quarter. The third quarter marked the 103rd consecutive quarter of international same store sales growth and the 34th consecutive quarter of U.S. same store sales growth. The Company had third quarter global net store growth of 214 stores, comprised of 40 net new U.S. stores and 174 net new international stores.\n\nDiluted EPS was $2.05 for the third quarter of 2019, up 5.1% over the prior year quarter, primarily resulting from higher income from operations, offset in part by a higher effective tax rate.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Company repurchased and retired 384,338 shares of its common stock under its Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for approximately $93.7 million, or an average price of $243.79 per share. On October 4, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock.\n\nOn October 4, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors declared a $0.65 per share quarterly dividend for shareholders of record as of December 13, 2019 to be paid on December 27, 2019.\n\n\"It was a good quarter for Domino's, as we continue to lean on our fundamental strength against a unique competitive environment,\" said Ritch Allison, Domino's Chief Executive Officer. \"Strong unit growth and positive comps yielded a solid and balanced quarter of retail sales growth across both the U.S. and international businesses. We remain steadfastly focused on driving profitable growth for the Domino's system, and most importantly, for our franchisees.\"\n\n(1) Refer to the Financial Results Comparability section on page three and the Comments on Regulation G section on pages four and five for additional details.\n\n(1) As previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2019, the Company sold 59 U.S. Company-owned stores to certain of its existing U.S. franchisees. The same store sales growth for these stores is reflected in U.S. franchise stores in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nThe table below outlines certain statistical measures utilized by the Company to analyze its performance. Refer to the Comments on Regulation G section on pages four and five for additional details.\n\n(2) Trailing four quarters net store growth does not include the effect of transfers. In the second quarter of 2019, the Company sold 59 U.S. Company-owned stores to certain of its existing U.S. franchisees.\n\nThe Company announced a new long-range outlook for certain business metrics. This new two- to three-year outlook replaces the Company's prior three- to five-year outlook.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nThe Company will file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q this morning. As previously announced, Domino's Pizza, Inc. will hold a conference call today at 10 a.m. (Eastern) to review its third quarter 2019 financial results. The call can be accessed by dialing (866) 470-5929 (U.S./Canada) or (409) 217-8311 (International). Ask for the Domino's Pizza conference call, ID 7185367. The call will also be webcast, and will be archived for one year, on biz.dominos.com.\n\nFinancial Results Comparability\n\nFinancial results for the Company can be significantly affected by changes in our capital structure, our effective tax rate, adoption of new accounting guidance, store portfolio changes and other factors. Our recapitalization transactions have historically resulted in higher net interest expense due primarily to higher net debt levels, as well as the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the repayment of certain of the Company's notes. Additionally, repurchases and retirements of the Company's common stock pursuant to our existing share repurchase program have reduced our weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to the above factors impacting comparability, the table below presents certain other items that affect comparability between 2019 and 2018 financial results. Management believes that including such information is critical to an understanding of the Company's financial results for the three fiscal quarters of 2019 as compared to the same periods in 2018 (refer to the Comments on Regulation G section on pages four and five for additional details).\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Fiscal Quarters\n\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n\nPre-tax\n\n\n\nAfter-tax\n\n\n\nDiluted EPS Impact\n\n2018 items affecting comparability:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecapitalization expenses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses (1)\n\n$ (532)\n\n\n\n$ (411)\n\n\n\n$ (0.01)\n\nInterest expense (2)\n\n\n\n(142)\n\n\n\n\n\n(110)\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\nDebt issuance cost write-off (3)\n\n\n\n(3,164)\n\n\n\n\n\n(2,446)\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.06)\n\nTotal of 2018 items\n\n$ (3,838)\n\n\n\n$ (2,967)\n\n\n\n$ (0.07)\n\n\n\n(1) Represents legal, professional and administrative fees incurred in connection with the Company's 2018 recapitalization transaction in which certain of the Company's subsidiaries issued notes pursuant to an asset-backed securitization (the \"2018 Recapitalization\"). The notes consisted of $425.0 million of Series 2018-1 4.116% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I and $400.0 million of Series 2018-1 4.328% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II (collectively, the \"2018 Notes\"). (2) Represents interest expense the Company incurred on its 2015 five-year fixed rate notes subsequent to the closing of the 2018 Recapitalization but prior to the repayment of the 2015 five-year fixed rate notes, resulting in the payment of interest on both the 2015 five-year fixed rate notes and 2018 Notes for a short period of time. (3) Represents the write-off of debt issuance costs related to the extinguishment of the 2015 five-year fixed rate notes in connection with the 2018 Recapitalization.\n\nShare Repurchases\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Company repurchased and retired 384,338 shares of its common stock under its Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for approximately $93.7 million, or an average price of $243.79 per share. As of September 8, 2019, the end of the third quarter, the Company's total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases was approximately $53.6 million.\n\nOn October 4, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock. This repurchase program replaces the remaining availability of approximately $53.6 million under the Company's existing $750.0 million share repurchase program.\n\nLiquidity\n\nAs of September 8, 2019, the Company had approximately:\n\n$66.7 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents;\n\nof unrestricted cash and cash equivalents; $3.44 billion in total debt; and\n\nin total debt; and $126.9 million of available borrowings under its $175.0 million variable funding notes, net of letters of credit issued of $48.1 million .\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $324.6 million during the three fiscal quarters of 2019. The Company invested $42.7 million in capital expenditures during the three fiscal quarters of 2019. Free cash flow, as reconciled below to net cash provided by operating activities, as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), was approximately $281.9 million during the three fiscal quarters of 2019 (refer to Comments on Regulation G section below for additional details).\n\n(in thousands)\n\nThree Fiscal Quarters of 2019\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n$ 324,596\n\nCapital expenditures\n\n\n\n(42,676)\n\nFree cash flow\n\n$ 281,920\n\n\n\nComments on Regulation G\n\nIn addition to the GAAP financial measures set forth in this press release, the Company has included non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G, including free cash flow metrics and measures related to items affecting comparability between fiscal quarters and other fiscal periods. The Company has also included metrics such as global retail sales growth and same store sales growth, which are commonly used statistical measures in the quick-service restaurant industry that are important to understanding Company performance.\n\nThe Company uses \"Global retail sales\" to refer to total worldwide retail sales at Company-owned and franchise stores. The Company believes global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. The Company reviews comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the Domino's Pizza\u00ae brand. In addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales. Retail sales for franchise stores are reported to the Company by its franchisees and are not included in Company revenues. Global retail sales growth is calculated as the change of U.S. Dollar global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. Global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year.\n\nThe Company uses \"Diluted EPS, as adjusted,\" which is calculated as reported diluted EPS, adjusted for the items that affect comparability to the prior year periods. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is diluted EPS. The Company believes that the diluted EPS, as adjusted, measure is important and useful to investors and other interested persons and that such persons benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison between reporting periods. The Company uses diluted EPS, as adjusted, to internally evaluate operating performance, to evaluate itself against its peers and in long-range planning. Additionally, the Company believes that analysts covering the Company's stock performance generally eliminate these items affecting comparability when preparing their financial models, when determining their published EPS estimates and when benchmarking the Company against its competitors.\n\nThe Company uses \"Same store sales growth,\" which is calculated by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable period of the prior year. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported excluding foreign currency impacts, which reflect changes in international local currency sales.\n\nThe Company uses \"Free cash flow,\" which is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, both as reported under GAAP. The Company believes that the free cash flow measure is important to investors and other interested persons, and that such persons benefit from having a measure which communicates how much cash flow is available for working capital needs or to be used for repurchasing debt, making acquisitions, repurchasing common stock or paying dividends.\n\nAbout Domino's Pizza\u00ae\n\nFounded in 1960, Domino's Pizza is the largest pizza company in the world based on retail sales, with a significant business in both delivery and carryout pizza.
