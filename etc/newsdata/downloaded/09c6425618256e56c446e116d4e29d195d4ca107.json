GM 2.90% closes out its second day, the company\u2019s use of temporary workers has emerged as a key bargaining issue as the United Auto Workers union negotiates a new labor contract.\n\nWith U.S. auto industry sales slowing, GM and its two Detroit peers\u2014 Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV\u2014are looking to increase the number of lower-cost temporary workers at their plants so they have more flexibility to dial back factory output if demand falls.\n\nRelying more on temporary workers is one way the car companies hope to keep rising labor costs in check without affecting the pay and benefits of full-time workers.\n\nThe union has resisted such efforts in the past and wants the car companies to restrict their use of temp hires, arguing that those workers fill jobs that could go to full-time employees. In asking workers to strike over the weekend, the UAW leadership cited GM\u2019s demands on temps as one reason the negotiations had stalled. The union has also said the expansion of temp workers\u2014who are also represented by the UAW\u2014in similar roles as those held by union members creates an unfair workplace.\n\nThe UAW resumed bargaining with GM this week trying to make progress on negotiations that have proceeded haltingly and aren\u2019t as far along as union and company negotiators had expected at this point, say people close to the negotiations. With key issues still unresolved, the strike appeared headed to a third day late Tuesday, according to a person close to the talks.\n\nThe two sides are trying to reach a new four-year labor agreement for nearly 46,000 full-time workers at GM\u2019s U.S. factories, a deal the union hopes to use as a template for talks with Ford and Fiat Chrysler.\n\nIn addition to temp workers, matters involving wages, health care and job security are also central to the negotiations. The union is also pushing GM to reopen idled factories and eliminate the pay gap between newer hires and veteran workers.\n\nThe use of temporary workers has long rankled many UAW members, who say it isn\u2019t fair to have temps working alongside permanent workers on the assembly line but earning less in wages and benefits. On average, temporary employees at GM start at about $15 an hour, whereas full-time line workers start at $17 an hour and can progress to $28 an hour over eight years.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to have them, at least give them an opportunity to become full-time,\u201d Keith Barbee, a UAW-represented full-time worker at GM\u2019s Detroit assembly plant, said of temp hires.\n\nThe auto industry is aiming to maximize its flexibility as it faces uncertainty on multiple fronts, including on trade and fuel-economy regulations, which could make it more difficult to plan for the future. Auto executives have argued temp-worker restrictions, which are agreed upon in the union contract, put U.S. car makers at a competitive disadvantage to foreign rivals.\n\nTemps account for about 7% of GM\u2019s factory workforce, versus more than 20% for the foreign-owned car plants, according to industry data. Ford has 6% temp workers. Fiat Chrysler declined to give a specific percentage but said its figures are in line with those of GM and Ford.\n\nGM has said its use of temporary workers has been critical to keeping its labor costs in check postbankruptcy. The car company often leans on temps to keep plants running smoothly as it launches new models or at times of the year when absenteeism peaks. Temporary shifts can also help in periods of high demand when GM needs to increase output quickly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a competitive issue,\u201d said Kristin Dziczek, a labor expert at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cAll of the other producers in North America are using a much, much higher percentage of temporary workers than GM is using.\u201d\n\nThe UAW has targeted other car makers in recent years for their use of temp workers as well. In trying to organize Nissan Motor Co. \u2019s factory in Canton, Miss., in 2017, the UAW sought to win over manufacturing workers by criticizing the company\u2019s widespread use of temp employees. That organizing drive ultimately failed.\n\nDennis Laubernds, a temporary worker at GM\u2019s assembly plant in Orion Township, Mich., has been a temporary worker on and off at the company since 2013. He hasn\u2019t secured a full-time job that would give him better health-care benefits, retirement savings and profit-sharing checks. \u201cIt\u2019s not really fair,\u201d he said.\n\nThe UAW leadership is sensitive to this issue because union negotiators must ultimately deliver a labor deal its rank-and-file members will ratify with a majority vote.\n\n\u2014Ben Foldy contributed to this article.", "description": "As a nationwide strike at General Motors closes out its second day, the company\u2019s use of temporary workers has emerged as a key bargaining issue as the United Auto Workers union negotiates a new labor contract.", "authors": ["Nora Naughton", "Nora.Naughton Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108033/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
