Dorsey said online political ads presented new challenges to the democratic process that require \u201cforward-looking\u201d solutions, including new regulations and improved transparency.\n\n\u201cWhile internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions,\u201d Dorsey said.\n\n\u201cInternet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimisation of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes.

(@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said he had considered removing political ads from Facebook entirely. The ads make up only a small portion of the social-media platform\u2019s advertising revenue, but Zuckerberg said banning ads from politicians could create a slippery slope in which ads dealing with specific issues, like healthcare and immigration, could be banned.\n\n\u201cPolitical ads are an important part of voice \u2013 especially for local candidates, up-and-coming challengers, and advocacy groups that may not get much media attention otherwise. Banning political ads favours incumbents and whoever the media covers,\u201dZuckerberg said in a speech delivered at Georgetown University.\n\n\u201cEven if we wanted to ban political ads, it\u2019s not clear where we\u2019d draw the line,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are many more ads about issues than there are directly about elections. Would we ban all ads about healthcare or immigration or women\u2019s empowerment? If we banned candidates\u2019 ads but not these, would that really make sense to give everyone else a voice in political debates except the candidates themselves?\u201d\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s speech was focused on freedom of expression, and the Facebook CEO said he didn\u2019t want his company to become the arbiters of truth on its social-media platform. Zuckerberg said the public should be able to decide which information is true or false in political ads and discourse. As a result, Facebook has chosen not to fact-check political ads, though commercial ads are subject to third-party fact-checkers.\n\nIn his thread announcing Twitter\u2019s complete ban on political ads, Dorsey\u2019s comments appeared to be in direct conversation with Zuckerberg\u2019s speech, including his claim that the decision was not about freedom of expression. Dorsey said Twitter considered just stopping ads from candidates but realised that ads about specific political issues created the same problem. As a result, Twitter won\u2019t allow paid advertisements about political issues, either.\n\nAs for the issue that removing paid political advertising would benefit incumbents: Dorsey said that while Twitter acknowledges that argument, he believes that politicians can still connect with users via organic conversations, rather than paid reach.\n\nIn addition, we need more forward-looking political ad regulation (very difficult to do). Ad transparency requirements are progress, but not enough. The internet provides entirely new capabilities, and regulators need to think past the present day to ensure a level playing field. \u2014 jack ???????????? (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nDorsey said Twitter wanted to focus on \u201cthe root problems\u201d that promote misinformation, threaten political discourse, and put elections at risk \u2013 accepting money from groups with political agendas puts Twitter in a compromising situation that hurts the company\u2019s credibility, he said. And so, Twitter has chosen to put a stop to political advertising altogether, at least for now.\n\nYou can read Dorsey\u2019s full Twitter thread below:\n\nWe\u2019ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons\u2026\n\nA political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimised and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.\n\nWhile internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions.\n\nInternet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimisation of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale.\n\nThese challenges will affect ALL internet communication, not just political ads. Best to focus our efforts on the root problems, without the additional burden and complexity taking money brings. Trying to fix both means fixing neither well, and harms our credibility.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s not credible for us to say: \u2018We\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad\u2026well\u2026they can say whatever they want!\u2019\n\nWe considered stopping only candidate ads, but issue ads present a way to circumvent. Additionally, it isn\u2019t fair for everyone but candidates to buy ads for issues they want to push. So we\u2019re stopping these too.\n\nWe\u2019re well aware we\u2019re a small part of a much larger political advertising ecosystem. Some might argue our actions today could favour incumbents. But we have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising. I trust this will only grow.\n\nIn addition, we need more forward-looking political ad regulation (very difficult to do). Ad transparency requirements are progress, but not enough. The internet provides entirely new capabilities, and regulators need to think past the present day to ensure a level playing field.\n\nWe\u2019ll share the final policy by 11/15, including a few exceptions (ads in support of voter registration will still be allowed, for instance). We\u2019ll start enforcing our new policy on 11/22 to provide current advertisers a notice period before this change goes into effect.\n\nA final note. This isn\u2019t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
