That was fewer than the 159,000 added in July but enough to keep unemployment levels near historic lows at 3.7%. Average hourly earnings increased 3.2% from a year earlier, the same pace as a month earlier.\n\nThe effects of trade tensions between the US and China have grown increasingly evident in recent weeks, fueling broader concerns about the economy. In a rare development that has historically preceded recessions, the yield curve inverted last month for the first time since before the global financial crisis.\n\nWhile the record 107th month of job gains could calm worries about an imminent downturn, it was unlikely to temper market hopes that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates again later this month. Policymakers have said they will closely monitor a trade dispute between the US and China that has grown more volatile in recent weeks.\n\n\"Today's jobs report is still a good sign for the labor market, indicating that workers continue to come in off the sidelines,\" said Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at Glassdoor. \"However, the pace of growth has slowed and sectoral weakness in manufacturing and retail don't bode well for an economy dealing with escalating trade tensions.\"\n\nThe US and China raised tariffs on each other on Sunday and vowed to expand them to far more consumer products in the coming months, escalations economists said would ripple through the labor market. Higher prices and disrupted supply chains have weighed on sectors like manufacturing, which added just 3,000 jobs in August.\n\n\"The narrowing in profit margins, disappointment in corporate earnings and a second-quarter decline in fixed business investment \u2014 which has defined the response to the radical changes in trade policy \u2014 are likely to lead to reduced hours, consideration of layoffs, and subsequently, reductions in workforce,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM.\n\nThe August print was partly boosted by the federal government, which hired a wave of temporary workers for the 2020 census. Healthcare added 24,000 jobs last month, while the financial services sector also posted robust growth.\n\nThe labor market struggled to pull Americans from the sidelines in August. The labor-force participation rate edged up to 63.2%, a figure that is still low by historical standards and compared with other countries.\n\nWith the effects of a $1.5 trillion tax-cut package and other stimulus measures fading, hiring was expected to cool over the past year. On average, the US added 156,000 jobs a month from June to August.\n\n\"At least some business owners and managers appear to have believed that the spike in demand triggered by the tax cuts would be sustained, despite the intensifying trade war, and hiring plans rose accordingly,\" said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \"But this outbreak of irrational optimism lasted only a few months.\"\n\nMarkets Insider is looking for a panel of millennial investors.
