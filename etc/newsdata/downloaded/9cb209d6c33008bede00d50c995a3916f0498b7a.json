On Wednesday, he said Ryan Fitzpatrick would start in Week 7 against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nRosen was benched at halftime against the Washington Redskins and Fitzpatrick nearly led the Dolphins to a win. Still, it\u2019s odd to give Rosen a vote of confidence and then yank him after only one half of football.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDolphins change their minds at quarterback\n\nHow surprising was the switch back to Fitzpatrick? Flores took questions for about seven minutes at his news conference before he was even asked about the quarterback position.\n\n\u201cIt gives us the best opportunity for this team to go up into a tough environemnt and try to pull out a win,\u201d Flores said.\n\nThe Dolphins are 0-5. It already looks like 0-16 is possible. Miami wants to avoid that. But it still seems like a statement about Rosen that a second-year quarterback who was drafted 10th overall last season and then acquired by the Dolphins in a trade isn\u2019t going to start for a hopeless, winless team.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of confidence in Josh, or else we wouldn\u2019t have played him,\u201d Flores said. \u201cFor him, it\u2019s got to be a day-to-day improve, get better and continue his development.\u201d\n\nJosh Rosen benched\n\nRosen hasn\u2019t been very good, though that\u2019s not all his fault. The Dolphins\u2019 offense around the quarterback position is the worst in the NFL. Rosen was 15-of-25 for 85 yards and two interceptions in the first half last week against the Redskins.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the annals of a league celebrating its 100th season, it's hard to do something that's never been done before. But according to @pfref no one before Josh Rosen on Sunday had thrown at least 25 passes, completed at least 15 and thrown for 85 yards or fewer. So, there's that. \u2014 Ben Shpigel (@benshpigel) October 16, 2019\n\nFlores put it simply: The Dolphins were better on offense with Fitzpatrick in. So the change was made. Again.\n\n\u201cOffensively we need more production,\u201d Flores said. \u201cWe got that out of Ryan the other day, for a quarter. In this game, this week, that was the best chance for us to be productive and we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d\n\nClearly the Dolphins aren\u2019t enamored with Rosen. Fitzpatrick is 36 years old. He\u2019s not the future. Rosen probably isn\u2019t either.\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick will start at quarterback this week for the Dolphins.
