Her national tour of Born in the City, Made for the Mountains is back in Toronto after packed shows in Calgary and Vancouver.\n\nOn Oct 5th, Gunaratnam is headlining the 16th New Normal show with her satirical and sometimes dark humour that celebrates her culture and love for camping.\n\nI think my life is a joke. - Thurka Gunaratnam\n\n\"It's funny that you sleep in the dark by yourself for fun, when you know there are bears around. Why are people doing this to themselves?\"\n\nWhen she took drama in high school, Gunaratnam says her parents asked her, \"why would you waste your time on that? Why aren't you taking the chemistry or the biology?\"\n\n\"Even now, my mom is like, 'are you sure you don't want to go to med school?' I'm like, 'I have two degrees, I think I'm okay.'\"\n\nAs a teacher, Gunaratnam says she brings a specific lens to the comedy scene. She is almost constantly wondering, \"how can we punch up instead of punching down?\"\n\nDj On, Tin Lorica, Belladonna VonShade, Thurka Gunaratnam, Emily Bilton and Sasha Mark.\n\nGunaratnam's line-up includes women, comedians with disabilities, indigenous comedians, people of colour, and the LGBTQ community. It brings in drag queens and kings, stand-up, and sketch groups.\n\n\"When I see people with humour from communities that are often not celebrated, or who are trolled, those are the comedians that I book,\" says Gunaratnam.\n\nNew Normal centres the narratives of the performers and compensates comedians, even if it is their first show.\n\nAudience at New Normal Comedy.\n\n\"At New Normal, your jokes cannot be homophobic, transphobic, racist or sexist.\"\n\nShe says it is the kind of show where the whole room will stand up and ask a person to leave if they are heckling.\n\nThese seemingly strict rules of behaviour make for a unique comedy experience.\n\n\"At New Normal we can make jokes in our mother tongue and translate,\" says Gunaratnam, \"we can do an accent and feel safe knowing half the room is here to laugh with us not at us or our culture.\"\n\nYou can see New Normal Comedy on the first Saturday of every month.", "description": "She turned her adventure into comedy.
