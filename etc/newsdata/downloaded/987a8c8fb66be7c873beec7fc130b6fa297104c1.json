Four years ago, Janine had to abandon her doctoral studies in teaching to look after Lukas full-time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d had a normal pregnancy, and Lukas looked healthy and normal when he was born. At six weeks [after his birth], the doctor sent us to have a head scan done because his head looked abnormally large. That\u2019s when we started noticing the first abnormalities \u2013 there was fluid in his head,\u201d Janine tells YOU.\n\nLukas didn\u2019t develop like other children. He\u2019s still unable to speak and walk, and his mom has to process his food otherwise he\u2019ll choke on it. He has an abnormally narrow airway, and a part of his brain is underdeveloped.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken him to more than 15 specialists in the past four years. He still has an MRI scan twice a year. But we don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing his condition and whether he has some sort of illness,\u201d says Janine.\n\nA few months ago, Lukas was hospitalised when he was diagnosed with swine flu. He also developed pneumonia.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t think he\u2019d make it,\u201d Janine recalls.\n\nHe\u2019s since been diagnosed with cerebral palsy and is injected with Botox to relax his hands and feet. He wears back and leg braces to straighten his legs and spine.\n\nThough he can\u2019t walk, he\u2019s able to propel himself on his tummy, Janine says.\n\nKoos, who works for a construction company, is the breadwinner.\n\nLukas has speech therapy and physiotherapy weekly. His parents would like to start him on occupational therapy, but they can\u2019t afford it right now.\n\n\u201cThough we have medical aid, his therapy isn\u2019t covered. He weighs 24 kg and I\u2019m really struggling to pick him up and carry him but we can\u2019t afford a wheelchair.\u201d\n\nJanine is convinced Lukas will continue making progress.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s improved so much since he started speech therapy. Eighteen months ago he wasn\u2019t communicating at all. Now he\u2019s trying to communicate in his way. He\u2019ll be watching something on the tablet and when the story is finished, he\u2019ll take my hand and [gesture to] me to put it on again,\u201d she says.\n\nJanine can\u2019t leave Lukas alone even for a moment as he starts screaming hysterically when she isn\u2019t near him. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d she says. \u201cBut on Saturday when Koos took him to his [therapeutic] horse-riding lesson, I was home alone. After a while the house was so quiet that I missed him.\u201d\n\nJanine and Koos have sent DNA and blood samples overseas for testing but all the tests came back normal.\n\n\u201cIt cost more than R50 000,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided we\u2019re done with testing to try to find out what\u2019s wrong. Now, we\u2019re just trying to keep him healthy.\u201d\n\nJanine admits she gets sad and disheartened sometimes when she sees other four-year-olds running around and climbing trees. But she can\u2019t imagine a life without Lukas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to find him a good school because I know the interaction will do him good and help him develop.\u201d", "description": "The family has travelled all over the country to various specialists in search of answers but without much success.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9432/d54b26b5f18c4180a70dc6b5d8d185b2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
