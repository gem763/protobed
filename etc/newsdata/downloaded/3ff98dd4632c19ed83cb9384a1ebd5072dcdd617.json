I can't stop working,\" Wenger told Sky Sports .\n\n\"I decided to move out of the Premier League because I am too linked with Arsenal. I had opportunities to work in England but I turned them down.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"I don't want to tell you [which clubs] because there are people in charge and it would unfair to them.\"\n\nThe 69-year-old became the latest recipient of the Legends of Football award at an event supported by the Premier League in aid of Nordoff Robbins charity.\n\nHe joins the likes of Sir Bobby Robson and Sir Kenny Dalglish on the exclusive list, and commended Arsenal for their bravery in appointing a \"Mr Nobody\" like him back in 1996.\n\n(Image: JM Enternational/REX)\n\n\"I'm very grateful for having been accepted in this country, because when I arrived it was not obvious.\n\n\"I have a huge respect for this country because they have a big passion for the game. And they are brave.\n\n\"And when I think of what Arsenal did when I arrived here I think it was really brave. And I respect that. Give a chance to Mr Nobody.\"\n\n(Image: JM Enternational/REX)\n\nWenger recently revealed he was considering a job offer from FIFA, but was yet to make a decision.\n\nAsked about his next steps at the awards bash, he added: \"What I'm doing in the future is to share what I've learned in the game. Where I don't know.\n\n\"Football today has a fantastic responsibility around the world. We live in a world where sport has become the religion all over the world, and world football has a huge responsibility now, and if I can help a little bit, why not?\"", "description": "He commended the club's bravery in appointing a \"Mr Nobody\" like him as manager over two decades ago", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Jm Enternational Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20534543.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-ENG-PR-ARSENAL-BURNLEY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
