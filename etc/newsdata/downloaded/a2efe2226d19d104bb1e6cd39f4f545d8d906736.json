Because, I had lost myself a bit.\u2019\n\nClarifying, she added: \u2018I think it happened as my relationship with Brad was coming to an end, then at the beginning of our separation. It was a complicated moment, where I didn\u2019t recognise myself anymore, where I had become\u2026 how can I say\u2026 smaller, almost insignificant, even if it wasn\u2019t necessarily visible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I felt a deep and genuine sadness, I was hurt. On the other hand, it was interesting to reconnect with this humility and even this insignificance I was feeling. Maybe this is what being human is in the end\u2026 On top of all this, I suffered some health issues. All these things settle in you and remind you of how lucky you are of being alive.\u2019\n\nSpeaking to French magazine Madame, the mum-of-six went on to say that rediscovering joy is a lesson she wants to teach her children.\n\nAngelina opened up about being a mum (Picture: Getty Images for Netflix)\n\nBrad and Angelina got married in 2014 and quickly became one of Hollywood\u2019s most beloved couples, before splitting in 2016, 11 years after they first started dating.\n\nThe Ad Astra star also previously spoke out about how he dealt with his pain from the split.\n\nBrad said he used \u2018drugs, booze and Netflix\u2019 to escape the pain of the split (Picture: NBCUniversal via Getty Images)\n\n\u2018What I realised is that I was running to avoid tough feelings, painful feelings,\u2019 he told CNN about their relationship ending.\n\n\u2018I just didn\u2019t know how to deal with them. Anything I found that I used for escape.\n\n\u2018Those kinds of difficult feelings, I don\u2019t know how better to describe it. It can be anything, drugs, booze, Netflix, snacks.
