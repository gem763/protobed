He demanded that Democrats provide him a copy of the Mueller report, sending Democratic staff scrambling to find one. He read directly from the report and asked Democrats to read passages to him.\n\nDuring a bathroom break, Lewandowski, who is considering running for the US Senate in New Hampshire, took an opportunity to tweet a link to his new Super Pac.\n\nTrump cheered Lewandowski along as he testified, tweeting that his opening statement was \u201cbeautiful\u201d. Meanwhile, Republicans on the panel forced a series of procedural votes, sending the hearing into disarray.\n\nThe hearing underscores what has been a central dilemma for the judiciary committee all year as it investigates, and potentially tries to impeach, Trump. Many in the Democrats\u2019 base want them to move quickly to try to remove Trump from office. But the White House has blocked the committee\u2019s oversight requests at almost every turn, declining to provide new documents or allow aides and associates to testify.\n\nLewandowski was a central figure in Mueller\u2019s report, which described two episodes in which Trump asked Lewandowski to tell the former attorney general Jeff Sessions to curtail Mueller\u2019s investigation, and fire Sessions if he refused to meet with Lewandowski. Lewandowski never delivered the message, instead delegating the task to the White House aide Rick Dearborn, who declined to comply, according to the report.\n\nPressed by a lawyer for the Democrats, Barry Berke, Lewandowski acknowledged he might have lied in a cable interview when he said he didn\u2019t remember the president asking him to get involved with Sessions. He added: \u201cI have no obligation to be honest with the media because they are just as dishonest as everybody else.\u201d\n\nTwo other witnesses who were subpoenaed alongside Lewandowski, Dearborn and the former White House aide Rob Porter, did not show up, on orders from the White House, which holds that former aides are \u201cabsolutely immune\u201d from testifying. Democrats are challenging that position in court.", "description": "Former campaign manager accuses lawmakers of \u2018petty and personal politics\u2019 as judiciary committee considers impeachment", "authors": ["Maanvi Singh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24dc2fa84f1d1e34c82c2021048dca72aadb584f/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=93f8d101ccecc9d72fb9f5c2e54f104f", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
