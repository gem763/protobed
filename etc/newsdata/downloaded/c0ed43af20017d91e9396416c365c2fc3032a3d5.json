Technically it wouldn't be a difficult or complex thing to do. There are plenty of precedents around the world where it has worked really well,\" said Duby.\n\nMini grids have become increasingly important on the continent and are being built at a rapid rate with more than 2 000 mini grids currently across Africa.\n\n\"It's a combination of people waking up to the fact that it is the only realistic solution for remote and rural electrification, combined with the ever-falling costs of the technology that make it increasingly viable,\" says Duby.\n\n\"At the same time, you have got governments starting to see precedents, starting to see regulations and policy landscapes that have worked and are not quite so scared of it as a route.\"\n\nHe said slowly the regulation side is easing and as a result the sector is growing.\n\nIn the view of Penny Herbst, director of strategy for Africa GreenCo, the business model for energy investment needs to change.\n\n\"There are far too many players that are comfortable with the same structures for investment, selling to an SOE with a government guarantee. What we really need at present is for investors to have a stake where their influence contributes to improving the electricity supply industry (ESI) as a whole,\" says Herbst.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The African Utility Week and POWERGEN Africa conference and exhibition will take place in Cape Town in partnership with the SA Ministry of Energy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8617/e33334e1c5474a169d04f53a35a5c7a0.png", "published_at": "2019-05-06"}
