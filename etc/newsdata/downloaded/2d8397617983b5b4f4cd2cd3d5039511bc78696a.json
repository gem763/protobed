SOP must be followed. Integrity is key!\n\n\n\n2)We have not chosen anyone as our strategic partner as alleged.\n\n\n\n3)It was a group meeting together with ORANGE eSports https://t.co/XB3dJEJbz4 \u2014 Syed Saddiq (@SyedSaddiq) October 25, 2019\n\nBut Syed Saddiq\u2019s response did not address the main question at the centre of the allegations: why was Cleo\u2019s owner Nur Fathiah Syazwana Shaharuddin part of the group meeting?\n\nChecks by Malay Mail have found that Cleo had been registered as a transportation and logistics firm and is an entity that is barely a week old, further fueling questions as to the company\u2019s legitimacy as an eSports specialist.\n\nIt was also revealed that Nur Fathiah had just joined Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM)\u2019s Segambut branch as a member earlier this week.\n\nThe Esports Kuala Lumpur Association (ESKL) had alleged that they were stopped by the minister\u2019s special officer from presenting its eSports development plan, while Cleo International and Orange E-sports were granted an audience with Syed Saddiq.\n\nNur Fathiah currently goes by the moniker \u201cCleopatra\u201d on her Instagram account, and was referred to as such by Orange E-sports in its statement to Malay Mail last Tuesday.\n\nShe is one of Cleo International\u2019s two directors. The other is one Mohamad Shahid A. Samad, 42, who shares the same residential address as her.\n\nNur Fathia received brickbats from some members of the public after a video of the meeting went viral on social media; there were (now-debunked) claims that she is Syed Saddiq\u2019s personal assistant, a transwoman, and that she received a major contract from the ministry.\n\nOrange\u2019s parent company Esports Business Network Sdn Bhd told Malay Mail it was invited to the meeting by Cleo International to introduce a youth initiative to the Youth and Sports Ministry.\n\nIt further explained that its role in the meeting was solely to discuss the eSports planning and execution part of the programme, and it holds no further role in the project aside from being the service provider of the eSports pillar.\n\nRelated Articles What criteria did Cleo International meet to be granted a meeting with you?
