Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal, as long as you bring on one new nuclear power plant every other day.\n\nRoger A. Pielke Jr., who teaches in the environmental studies program at the Boulder campus, ran the numbers on Democratic proposals to achieve carbon neutrality, which range from the New York Democrat\u2019s 2030 goal to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s 2050 target.\n\nTo reach net-zero emissions by 2030, or in 3,746 days from now, would mean deploying about four nuclear power plants per day globally, and \u201cfor the United States, the deployment of a new nuclear plant about every other day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t often see these numbers for obvious reasons,\u201d Mr. Pielke said in a Monday op-ed in Forbes. \u201cThe scale \u2014 no matter what assumptions one begins with \u2014 is absolutely, mind-bogglingly huge.\u201d\n\nAchieving net-zero carbon emissions worldwide by 2050 would mean firing up three nuclear power plants every two days the size of the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station in Homestead, Florida, which produces about 1 mtoe [millions of tons of oil equivalent] in a year.\n\nLots of discussion and comments on this piece, thanks.\n\nThe scale of net-zero carbon dioxide is tough to appreciate, this is my attempt to put it into readily comprehensible terms \u2935\ufe0f https://t.co/jtAxkuLtKx \u2014 Roger Pielke Jr. (@RogerPielkeJr) October 2, 2019\n\n\n\nOf course, Democrats are split on nuclear power. The Ocasio-Cortez Green New Deal resolution calls for solar and wind energy, but says nothing about nuclear, although the congresswoman has said her plan \u201cleaves the door open for nuclear so that we can have that conversation.\u201d\n\nAmong the 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidates, Sen. Cory Booker and Andrew Yang have expressed support for building new-generation nuclear power plants, while Sen. Bernie Sanders is leery, calling it a \u201cfalse solution.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren has committed to achieving 100% carbon neutrality on electricity emissions by 2030 \u2014 and 100% renewable, zero-emission energy by 2035 \u2014 while phasing out nuclear power by 2035.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to build any nuclear power plants and we\u2019re going to start weaning ourselves off nuclear energy and replacing it with renewable fuels,\u201d she said at last month\u2019s CNN town hall on the \u201cclimate crisis.\u201d\n\nWhat that means: lots of windmills. Using wind energy instead of nuclear to achieve net-zero global emissions by 2050 would require deploying about 1,500 wind turbines over about 300 square miles \u201cevery day starting tomorrow and continuing to 2050,\u201d Mr. Pielke said.\n\nHe pointed out that the world is actually moving away from net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions, adding last year \u201cmore than 280 mtoe of fossil fuel consumption and 106 mtoe of carbon-free consumption,\u201d he said, citing figures provided by the BP Statistical Review of World Energy.\n\n\u201cIn a round number, the deployment rate of carbon-free energy would need to increase by about 800%,\u201d Mr. Pielke said. \u201cMake no mistake, these numbers are sobering. They indicate in readily understandable terms that the world, and the United States, are not moving towards net-zero carbon dioxide emissions and in fact, every day, we are moving in the opposite direction.\u201d\n\nReaching net-zero emissions by 2050 may require an enormous undertaking, he said, but is not impossible as long as policymakers and others understand the scale of the challenge.\n\n\u201cAuctions of promises for emissions reductions don\u2019t actually reduce emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology reduces emissions.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
