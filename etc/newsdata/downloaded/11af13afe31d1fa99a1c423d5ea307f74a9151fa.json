Facebook responded to that letter today with their own letter to Biden saying that the company\u2019s policies prevented it from making judgment calls on the veracity of speech in political advertisements. The New York Times has a full run-down of the situation.\n\nFacebook isn\u2019t alone in this manner; Fox News is remaining fair and balanced on the issue as well. CNN refused to run the ad.\n\nPolitical campaigns are messy, so America\u2019s largest content company \u2014 with more content moderators than any publication in the country \u2014 is leaving it to the free press to debunk what it\u2019s getting paid to broadcast. But it\u2019s not that Facebook wants to keep raking in stupid amounts of advertising dollars, no, it\u2019s that the company is grounded in a \u201cfundamental belief in free expression,\u201d they say.\n\nHere\u2019s a quote from the company\u2019s letter to Biden\u2019s team: \u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry, what? Facebook\u2019s \u201crespect for the democratic process\u201d should raise eyebrows given how its products have been used in some highly publicized scenarios, but how does a platform that\u2019s been abused so much to the detriment of democratic processes feel like it deserves to rattle that phrase off as another PR talking point?\n\nHere\u2019s the rest of the letter:\n\nHere's the letter Facebook sent the @JoeBiden campaign explaining why it allowed Trump to run Facebook ads with false allegations about the VP and Ukraine \u2014 @sarahmucha reports. https://t.co/HFMdDqpzXH pic.twitter.com/VbUlW2C6qI \u2014 Donie O'Sullivan (@donie) October 9, 2019\n\nIf Facebook just wants to allow politicians to spout mistruths and conspiracy theories without fact checks on its platforms as status updates from their personal pages, then some of these claims could be taken more seriously, but Facebook is getting paid to push these messages to its users. It\u2019s algorithmically deciding where these messages go based on parameters set by the campaigns via a system it designed.\n\nBefore you sound off, yeah, political advertising isn\u2019t anything new. I am well aware that TV channels and newspapers have carried messy attack ads and hauled in the advertising revenues for decades, but Facebook is a platform designed around scale. Scale has allowed the company to tap massive revenue streams, but it\u2019s also opened up the company to critiques. The company has learned to respect this scale after sizable amounts of external pressure were applied, but they\u2019ve always defaulted to dated comparisons when it\u2019s profitable to them.\n\nNewspaper and TV political ads are painted with a wider brush and are subject to more stringent laws, but there\u2019s a responsibility in Facebook\u2019s precise ad-targeting that the company still doesn\u2019t seem to respect. The company has the tools to push out judgment calls on content, and it could still do so on a case-by-case basis. Some truths are buried in more nuance than others, but by painting all political claims in its same bath of indifference to truth, Facebook is abusing its scale and creating a platform where a politician\u2019s speech is exempt, as if political leaders aren\u2019t the ultimate primary sources on politically contentious matters.\n\nPolitical advertising legislation is going to take far too long to catch up to the current landscape of technology platforms \u2014 it would be nice if we could trust Facebook to stay at a moral forefront that isn\u2019t legally mandated. Twitter and YouTube aren\u2019t immune to this same criticism either, but Facebook is operating in broad daylight, believing that they can reverse engineer a free expression mission statement to prevent responsibility-free revenues from leaking out.", "description": "Ensuring politicians in the 2020 election stay truthful is hard work, so Facebook has decided it\u2019s going to sit this one out.
