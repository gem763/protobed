The show is pure comedy gold, thanks in no small part to its phenomenal cast.\n\nNow, six years since the show\u2019s season nine finale, actors Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey, who played the roles of Pam Beesly and Angela Martin respectively, are teaming up on a podcast about the series called Office Ladies \u2013 and I can\u2019t wait.\n\nThe duo will re-watch episodes of the show and share trivia, stories from behind the scenes, and other anecdotes from their lives on set, as well as from their years-long friendship that\u2019s outlasted the series.\n\nIt\u2019ll be published by Earwolf, A Stitcher-owned podcast network that\u2019s also produced big-name shows like Conan O\u2019Brien Needs a Friend, Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness, and How Did This Get Made?\n\nCredit: Earwolf A selection of Earwolf\u2019s podcasts\n\nOffice Ladies will launch on October 16, with one episode a week \u2013 which, as TechCrunch noted, doesn\u2019t give Fischer and Kinsey enough time to go through all 188 episodes before the TV series leaves Netflix in 2021. Oh well, I\u2019m fine with them skipping the final season anyway.\n\nRead next: PSA: You can now cover your iPhone with a monthly AppleCare+ plan forever", "description": "Actors Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey, who played Pam Beesly and Angela Martin on The Office, are teaming up on a podcast about the series.", "authors": ["Abhimanyu Ghoshal"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F09%2FPam-Angela-The-Office.jpg&signature=b7e3f7b759058d4fd45641bed564b6a3", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
