Our intelligence source was involved in sending coordinates, directing the airdrop, participating in and making the operation a success until the last minute,\" he said.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @PolatCanRojava 3 - Our own source, who had been able to reach Al Baghdadi, brought Al Baghdadi\u2019s underwear to conduct a DNA test and make sure (100%) that the person in question was Al Baghdadi himself. \u2014 \u0628\u0648\u0644\u0627\u062a \u062c\u0627\u0646 Polat Can (@PolatCanRojava) October 28, 2019 Report\n\nMr Can added that the SDF had been working with the CIA to track Baghdadi since 15 May, and had discovered that he was hiding in Idlib province, where the raid took place.\n\nThe source, said Mr Can, had found out that the IS leader was about to move to a new location in Jarablus.\n\nThe SDF have been key allies of the US in the battle against the Islamic State (IS) group, but earlier this month Mr Trump pulled American troops out of northern Syria.\n\nAnalysts say the US withdrawal in effect gave Turkey the green light to begin a cross-border assault on the region.\n\nWhat do we know about the raid?\n\nSeveral US allies or powers in the region were given advance notification of the raid, including Turkey, Iraq, Kurdish forces in north-eastern Syria, and Russia, which controls airspace over Idlib.\n\nThe troops arrived to a barrage of shots from the ground, reports said.\n\nOn landing, the US force called on Baghdadi, who had fled into a tunnel, to come out and surrender.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Security correspondent Frank Gardner: \"He has symbolised the leadership of so-called Islamic State\"\n\nThe force blew holes in the walls to avoid any booby traps in doors. The retreating Baghdadi then detonated his suicide vest, killing himself and three children in the tunnel.\n\nMr Trump said test results carried out on the remains \"gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification\" that it was Baghdadi.\n\nThe tests were carried out on site by technicians who accompanied the special forces personnel and had samples of Baghdadi's DNA with them, reports said.\n\nThey combined facial recognition technology and a smaller DNA reader that troops can use aboard their helicopters to obtain the results, according to the Daily Beast.\n\nThe technicians also brought \"substantial pieces\" of the body back with them on the helicopters.\n\nOn Monday, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen Mike Milley, said that American officials had disposed of Baghdadi's remains.\n\nHe said the burial was now \"complete and was handled appropriately\" without providing any further details.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Body language expert analyses Trump's Situation Room photo\n\nAn anonymous official told the Reuters news agency that Baghdadi had been given religious rites according to the Islamic custom and buried at sea.\n\nA similar process was carried out following the killing of al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011.", "description": "Kurdish-led forces say their spy stole the clothing from the IS chief's hideout, proving he was there.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07sdyjd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
