I only quit full-time work in May 2018. Still, it doesn\u2019t take long to pick up a few things about life in retirement. Here are four insights I\u2019ve gained over the past year and a half:\n\n1. It\u2019s important to have a plan. I have witnessed how some retirees, without a plan or direction, struggle to fill the empty time. Here in Spain, for some retirees it can become an endless \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d cycle of daily drinking and tapas hopping. The only sign of creativity is, \u201cWhich bar today?\u201d One study linked retirement to a 40% greater probability of suffering from clinical depression, especially among men.\n\nWhen your day is no longer occupied with work, meetings, projects and commutes, how do you fill the time? Retirement is like a blank canvas. You\u2019re free to paint, draw or make of it anything you want. That can be liberating, but it\u2019s also quite daunting when you first confront the canvas. Many retirees are uncomfortable with the prospect, especially if they step in front of the blank canvas with just the vague notion that they want to create \u201csomething.\u201d In retirement, we not only have to continue to do things on purpose, but also we need a sense of purpose.\n\nRead: How this couple retired to Spain\u2019s gorgeous Andalusia region on about $40,000 a year \u2014 and you can, too\n\n2. Old habits die hard. It\u2019s hard to switch off \u201cworking mode\u201d right after retirement. I admit I still tackle tasks furiously, with an imaginary deadline-meeting determination that causes my husband, Jim, to joke, \u201cDon\u2019t get in Jiab\u2019s way, because she\u2019s on a mission.\u201d It\u2019s a lifelong habit that I developed from a young age. No doubt this focus helped me to succeed in graduate school and in my career. But in retirement, it can also bring self-imposed stress. Every day, I work to tame my relentlessness\u2014but at least I haven\u2019t set a deadline to achieve this particular goal.\n\nSimilarly, I\u2019ve noticed that how others deal with retirement isn\u2019t so different from how they approached life before retirement. Passive people tend to stay passive, proactive people stay proactive and busy people find things to keep themselves busy. If you\u2019ve been pushing off exercise your whole life and think you\u2019ll get fit after you retire, you will find plenty of excuses to not exercise, even after you quit the workforce. It is easier to remain the same\u2014unless you make a conscious effort to change.\n\n3. It\u2019s better with a partner. While change is hard to both initiate and adjust to, it is easier if you have a partner\u2014one who\u2019s on the same page as you. Jim and I retired at the same time with similar outlooks on retirement. Not only do we share goals, like traveling, but also we support each other\u2019s individual passions, from Jim\u2019s book writing to my learning guitar.\n\nWe also push each other to be better. That\u2019s our competitive nature. Our Spanish has improved significantly over the past year, because we see each other practicing and neither wants to be left behind. When you live alone, it\u2019s easy to take the path of least resistance and binge watch Netflix in English for three days, instead of getting out. This is why many improvement programs have a buddy or sponsor system. Being accountable to another person makes you, well, accountable.\n\n4. Learning gets harder as we age. After my retirement, I took up designing, building and maintaining a blog. Along with the blog, I started to write, both for our blog and for financial websites. I found that writing is a process that can\u2019t be rushed. For every piece I draft, I have to edit it multiple times more. I now call writing \u201crewriting.\u201d The process takes many weeks, because I need to let the ideas and phrasing flow and gel in my mind. As a lifelong numbers person, writing is definitely using a weaker muscle. It\u2019s what makes it hard, but also rewarding.\n\nBecause I\u2019m already fluent in Thai and English, learning another language\u2014Spanish\u2014should be easy, right? Not quite. It\u2019s much tougher to learn a new language in my 50s than when I began learning English at age 10. I don\u2019t retain words as well as I used to and the rules don\u2019t click quite as easily. While it\u2019s true that you\u2019re never too old to learn something new, the older you are, the steeper the learning curve.\n\nStill, there\u2019s one Spanish phrase I\u2019ve learned that gives me heart: poco a poco\u2014little by little.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Humble Dollar.
