So much for Bulgaria manager Krassimir Balakov\u2019s claim that the country\u2019s football culture does not have a problem with racism.\n\nThe game does.\n\nThe hope is this is the start of something different in tackling it.\n\nThe events that this game will really be remembered for began around the 27th minute. That was when an angry Mings signalled to teammates, after monkey chants had been heard when he and Rashford got on the ball. This was passed on to captain Kane, who notified referee Ivan Bebek.\n\nUefa delegate Danilo Filacchone had by this point already been animatedly talking into his walkie talkie from his pitchside hut.\n\nIt was then that a grim piece of history was made. It was the first time that Uefa\u2019s three-step protocol was put into effect, with the public address system declaring that the referee would consider abandoning the match due to \u201cracist behaviour\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is an important stadium announcement,\u201d began what was genuinely a historic announcement. \u201dBecause of racist behaviour which is interfering with the game, the referee has indicated that he may have to suspend the match.\n\n\u201cRacism in football stadiums will not be tolerated. Please be in no doubt that the game will be suspended and may be abandoned if racist behaviour continues amongst spectators. Help everyone enjoy the game and say no to racism. Thank you.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t have the desired effect, as events instead got more complicated.\n\nThe abuse continued, and the game was stopped again. Some FA officials privately expected step two to be enacted, with the players moved to the dressing room. It was then that Kane could be seen consulting with his teammates.\n\nThey pointedly stayed on the pitch, but \u2013 notably \u2013 other figures left the stadium. A group of hoodied home supporters entirely dressing in black and believed to be \u2018Lauta Army\u2019 Levski Sofia ultras were marched out, as riot police also gathered outside.\n\nInside, England fans were continuing their own chanting of \u201cyou racist bastards, you know what you are\u201d. They were later warned to stay in their end for security reasons.\n\nThe situation hadn\u2019t quite yet quelled, and it was at half-time we had the remarkable scene of Bulgarian captain Ivelin Popov going over to his own fans, having a clear argument with them about the seriousness of the situation.\n\nThat brought the welcome lull of the break, and \u2013 according to sources \u2013 fevered discussions among officials about what to do next.\n\nSo much was at that point unclear, other than the depressing grimness of this situation.\n\nThe Bulgarian players were themselves involved in a long discussion at half-time, which meant the England team were actually on the pitch on their own for a surprisingly extended period. They came out to the sound of boos from the home crowd.\n\nThere was a sense of unreality to the game at that point, as if everyone \u2013 and especially the Bulgarian team \u2013 was going through the motions.\n\nEngland were 4-0 and just creating chances with ease, before Raheem Sterling added the fifth, and Kane the sixth.\n\nIt all seemed secondary.\n\nThe running order, for the record, was Rashford opening the scoring after seven minutes with a spectacular drought-ending goal that will be personally important to him, before Ross Barkley added two from close range after some brilliant football. The abuse and protocol had by then started, creating such a sombre context for Sterling to hit a fourth before half-time. He claimed his second and England\u2019s fifth shortly after it, but these were then mere details.\n\nEvents had taken over. This was no longer about the football, but is so important to football.", "description": "This was a night of grimly unprecedented scenes in Sofia, which brought up so many present problems in the game and society, but may well prove a landmark for its future.", "authors": ["Miguel Delaney"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/14/21/southgate-rashford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
