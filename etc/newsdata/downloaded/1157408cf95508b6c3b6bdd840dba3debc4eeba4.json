In 2019, Apple will represent 47.3% of proximity mobile payment users. Starbucks will represent 39.4% of proximity mobile payment users.\n\nThe point-of-sale terminal upgrade has given Apple Pay a boost, but also is giving Google Pay and Samsung Pay a lift. Those two payment systems are splitting the Android market, said eMarketer with Google Pay leading Samsung Pay by a little more than 2 million users.\n\nOverall, proximity mobile payments will be a $100 billion market in the US with 64 million users.", "description": "An upgrade cycle for point-of-sale terminals has given Apple Pay and its Android rivals a boost.", "authors": ["Larry Dignan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/12/05/a4d8f3c1-2949-461c-a533-2ccb21df6f62/thumbnail/770x578/0f43e874e2af192edae179ea88e3898b/apple-pay-cash.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
