She wrote that \"existing rules of the House provide House Committees with full authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction.\"\n\nPelosi added: \"We hope you and other Republicans share our commitment to following the facts, upholding the Constitution, protecting our national security, and defending the integrity of our elections at such a serious moment in our nation\u2019s history.\"\n\nOn Thursday night, McCarthy fired back. \"Your proclamations of fairness fall flat when you deny a process that provides it. Simply put, you are failing to meet the basic standards of due process observed by past speakers of the House,\" he wrote in a letter. \"Without transparent and equitable rules and procedures, the American people will forever understand this sham process for what it is\u2014the fulfillment of a partisan goal to reverse the 2016 election.\"\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s complaint about limiting Republican participation is a reference to reports that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., was limiting Republicans' ability to ask questions during Thursday\u2019s testimony by former U.S. envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker.\n\nIn his initial letter to Pelosi, McCarthy asked a number of questions, including whether Pelosi plans to hold a full House vote on authorizing the impeachment inquiry, whether she plans to grant subpoena powers to both the committee chairs and the ranking members, and whether she\u2019ll allow Trump\u2019s lawyers to attend the hearings.\n\nAfter concerns were first raised about an \"equal playing field\" during the Volker session, Fox News is told Democrats made concessions and agreed to equal representation from Democratic and Republican counsels in the room. However, even though there are representatives from the Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees, only the Intelligence Committee can ask questions.\n\nVolker \u2013 who resigned from his post last week -- testified Thursday in a closed-door interview about an anonymous whistleblower\u2019s complaint about a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s family\u2019s dealings in the country.\n\nVolker was expected to voluntarily give a transcribed interview before the Schiff-led Intelligence Committee as part of its impeachment inquiry into whether Trump abused his authority by asking Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden, a leading candidate for the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential nomination. Trump is being investigated amid claims that he threatened to withhold $400 million in military aid unless Ukraine investigated Biden, his son Hunter, and their business dealings in the country.\n\nThe House minority leader's letter earned him the praise of President Trump, who also took the opportunity to slam the Democrats who opened the impeachment inquiry into him.\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s questions come a day after the leading Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Michael McCaul, said in a letter to Chairman Eliot L. Engel, D-N.Y., that despite statements made by Pelosi and other Democrats, \u201cthere is not a 'House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry\u201d because the entire House has not voted on the matter.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nCiting House Rules X and XI, McCaul said that until Congress members from both parties vote to create a special impeachment task force to carry out proceedings, \u201cIntelligence Chairman Adam Schiff lacks the jurisdiction to investigate the Department of State\u2019s conduct of United States foreign policy toward Ukraine. That prerogative belongs to our Members.\u201d\n\n\u201cOfficial impeachment inquiries are initiated by the adoption of a House resolution empowering or creating a committee or task force to undertake such activities,\u201d McCaul continued. \u201cIn both the Nixon and Clinton cases, the Judiciary Committee debated and reported a resolution authorizing the Judiciary Committee to investigate whether there were sufficient grounds to impeach the President, which was then debated and voted on by the full House of Representatives. There have been no such debates or votes in this Congress.\u201d\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram, Danielle Wallace and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., sent a letter on Thursday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., calling on her to suspend the impeachment inquiry into President Trump until \u201cequitable rules and procedures\u201d are set up.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/25/694940094001_6089426092001_6089421483001-vs.jpg"}
