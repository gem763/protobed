Norwich head coach Daniel Farke had a typically colourful way to describe the size of his task right now.\n\n'As a coach you are a competitor and sometimes try to create some unrealistic things, unrealistic targets.\n\n'That's what we are trying to do. Our sporting director (Stuart Webber) created the spectre of we have to try and climb Mount Everest at the moment without any tools. We are trying to go for that one. It's not like we want to climb down or to die, we want to see the sun go up and we are on top.'\n\nDaniel Farke's Norwich side played out a goalless draw away at Bournemouth on Saturday\n\nThe loss of his impressive 21-year-old defender Ben Godfrey, Norwich's last fit centre back, meant their injury curse struck again. But buoyed by a first away point of the season at Bournemouth, Farke is still finding a way to smile and remain upbeat.\n\nTo get through their difficulties Farke has had to be creative, especially tactically. He ended this game with two central midfielders in the heart of his defence. He has had to keep his players' spirits up, and persuading those responsible for 'doing something magic on the pitch' to contribute to the other side of the game \u2014 the 'soft skills' as he calls them \u2014 has also been key.\n\nTop scorer Teemu Pukki busting a gut to chase lost causes, Emiliano Buendia barging past badly-positioned referee Lee Mason to keep Norwich on the attack rather than throwing up his arms in frustration, and Todd Cantwell popping up everywhere was just the sort of application he wanted to see against Bournemouth.\n\nNorwich's injury curse struck again after Ben Godfrey was forced off against Bournemouth\n\n'Good body language, good reaction to loss of the ball, help a bit more in defence, show more steel in many situations. For that I have just compliments for my offensive players and little magicians.'\n\nThere was less to encourage Bournemouth's Eddie Howe, who admits his side's home form is a worry.\n\n'Two wins in 11. You want to be winning regularly at home. That is tough in this division. We want the supporters to be in a really good atmosphere and the only way to do that is to win. That's our objective in our next home game.'", "description": "Newly-promoted, favourites to go down, a tiny budget and an unprecedented injury crisis.
