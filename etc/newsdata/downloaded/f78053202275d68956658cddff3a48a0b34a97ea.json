John Zmirak is, like Barrett, a Catholic. But he believes the law-review article demonstrates an understanding of church and state both false and dangerous. He argues that Barrett cannot be trusted to rule in line with the Constitution, might make decisions that instead follow the faddish dictates of a pope, and would render any ruling overturning Roe v. Wade illegitimate. He concludes that unless she renounces her \u201cweirdly theocratic\u201d views, she should not be nominated and senators should vote against her if she is nominated.\n\nZmirak has drawn several responses (here and here for example). As the respondents note, he ignores comments by her, including comments at her confirmation hearing, that contradict his argument. He ignores her record as an appeals-court judge, which includes none of the lawless imposition of papal views that he warns against. And the article is more than two decades old; she wrote it with a professor while she was a law student.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ramesh Ponnuru", "Nationalreview.Com Defending-Amy-Coney-Barrett-Religious-Views"], "top_image": ""}
