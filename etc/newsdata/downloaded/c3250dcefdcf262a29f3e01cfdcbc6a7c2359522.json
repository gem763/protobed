With nearly 1 million unauthorized crosses in fiscal year 2019, the government still only charged about 106,000 people with either illegal entry or illegal re-entry after a previous deportation.\n\nAnother 4,297 people were charged with migrant smuggling, harboring or otherwise assisting in the illegal traffic.\n\nMost of those were drivers or foot guides, who help the illegal immigrants cross the border and get to their destinations inside the U.S.\n\nEach category set a new record.\n\nThe previous high for smuggling cases came during the George W. Bush administration, while the highest numbers for illegal entry and re-entry came during the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThese record-breaking numbers are a testament to the dedication of our U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices throughout the nation, especially our Southwest border offices,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
