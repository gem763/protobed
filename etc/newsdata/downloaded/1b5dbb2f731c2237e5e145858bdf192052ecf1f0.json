Peterman on Seinfeld, was discussing Will & Grace stars Debra Messing and Eric McCormack, who called for a list of people attending an upcoming Beverly Hills fundraiser for President Donald Trump. (O\u2019Hurley obviously isn\u2019t a fan of their controversial stance and referred to their comments as \u201clunacy.\u201d)\n\nView photos John O'Hurley attends the 2019 Festival of Arts Celebrity Benefit Event on Aug. 24 in Laguna Beach, Calif. (Photo: Michael Kovac/Getty Images for Festival of Arts of Laguna Beach) More\n\nIn a phone interview Thursday, he tells Yahoo Entertainment more about what he meant.\n\n\u201cYou just feel like your ideas are not welcome, that everybody is moving in a lock-step,\u201d O\u2019Hurley says. \u201cIt creates a very uncreative atmosphere, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that\u2019s healthy for Hollywood. I believe that all ideas should be welcome, that\u2019s the nature of creativity. The artistic expression is the act of the infinite possibility. And in order to have that, you have to have all the colors available on the palette. You have to have all perspectives of what you\u2019re working with, and for people to want to cancel each other out because of the way that they feel, is just a dangerous and unhealthy atmosphere.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Hurley\u2019s suggestion for remedying that is for people to approach everything with civility.\n\n\u201cAll ideas are welcome. Whatever my political thoughts are are really nobody else\u2019s business and... they don\u2019t deserve to be celebrated just because I\u2019m a celebrity,\u201d O\u2019Hurley says. \u201cI don\u2019t feel as though I have an additional pulpit, that I\u2019ve earned that because I\u2019m a so-called celebrity.\u201d\n\nThat may be the most precious response I have received since I spoke yesterday on Fox... bless you for your gentility and civility... dogs teach us that- don\u2019t they....? https://t.co/vIjXN3e9XH \u2014 John O'Hurley \u2618\ufe0f\ud83d\udc15\u2618\ufe0f (@ImJohnOHurley) September 4, 2019\n\nO\u2019Hurley reveals he received \u201can enormous amount of support\u201d on social media in response to his comments. Both Trump and The View co-host Whoopi Goldberg also went in on Messing and McCormack, who have since said their comments were misinterpreted.\n\nAs for O\u2019Hurley, he\u2019s focusing on the Los Angeles debut of his one-man show, A Man With Standards, on Sept. 20-21 at Feinstein\u2019s at Vitello\u2019s in Studio City, Calif. It\u2019s his part in bringing back the supper club, where audiences enjoy dinner and entertainment in the same place, making for what he considers an elegant evening, the way it was when going out for dinner was still an event.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just basically the stories of my life, and I use the music of the \u201850s and \u201860s \u2014 Sinatra, Mancini \u2014 to underscore and accompany these kind of wacky periods of my life,\u201d O\u2019Hurley explains.\n\nView photos John O'Hurley played J.

Although he was only on Seinfeld from 1995 to 1998, the so-called show about nothing is still going strong in reruns today and he continues to be recognized by fans.\n\nHe has nothing but fond memories of his time there.", "description": "John O'Hurley talks about being a conservative in Hollywood and \"Seinfeld.\"", "authors": ["Raechal Shewfelt", "Editor", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_zlGlca5kz8f3YGVXMyL2Q--~B/aD03NDc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/456b6980-d027-11e9-bfbd-a5d8e1b8cdc3", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
