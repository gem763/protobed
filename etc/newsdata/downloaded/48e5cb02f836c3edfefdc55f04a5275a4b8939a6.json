But they haven\u2019t brought the American people with them.\n\nEven as nearly two-thirds of Democratic members favor impeaching President Donald Trump or at least opening an impeachment inquiry, a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows they haven\u2019t made the sale to voters. Only 37 percent support beginning impeachment proceedings, while half oppose it. Just 12 percent of voters are undecided.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSince the release of former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report in the spring, overall support for impeachment has fluctuated between 35 percent and 38 percent, while opposition has ranged from 46 percent to 53 percent.\n\nAmong Democrats, however, 7 in 10 support beginning impeachment proceedings. Only 18 percent of Democratic voters oppose impeachment. Among registered voters who said they intend to participate in a Democratic presidential primary or caucus in their states, 68 percent want Congress to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump, while 20 percent do not.\n\nRepublicans are in near-lockstep in opposition to impeachment: Only 6 percent want to begin proceedings. But independents tilt heavily against impeaching Trump. Only 31 percent want Congress to begin impeachment proceedings, compared with 50 percent who think Congress should not begin impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cInitiating impeachment proceedings against President Trump remains a popular move among the Democratic base, but it won\u2019t necessarily help them win voters across the aisle,\u201d said Tyler Sinclair, Morning Consult\u2019s vice president. He added that the \u201cnumbers have marginally changed from July following Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill, after which 34 percent of independents and 8 percent of Republicans supported impeachment.\u201d\n\nLast week, the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to establish the parameters of an impeachment inquiry. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has downplayed the possibility that Democrats would move to impeach Trump, given the realities of public opinion and the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nWhile less than 40 percent of voters support impeaching Trump, the president is still in severe political peril, the poll shows. His approval rating is 43 percent and has been mired in the low 40s for most of the summer.\n\nJust 37 percent said they will \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d vote to reelect Trump next year, while 53 percent will \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d vote for someone else.\n\nThe POLITICO/Morning Consult poll was conducted Sept. 13-15, surveying 1,994 registered voters. The margin error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nMorning Consult is a nonpartisan media and technology company that provides data-driven research and insights on politics, policy and business strategy.\n\nMore details on the poll and its methodology can be found in these two documents: Toplines: https://politi.co/2klGn9N | Crosstabs: https://politi.co/2mfiMIr", "description": "7 in 10 Democrats support beginning impeachment proceedings, a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll found.", "authors": ["Steven Shepard"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/79/d8/799fec7747e2adb35a5de6544162/190917-pelosi-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
