AAP\n\nThe Treasurers agreed with Prime Minister Scott Morrison that capacity constraints caused by the current large infrastructure build mean no more large projects can be brought forward as a stimulus measure.\n\nThe federal government is holding out against spending more money, arguing its current policy settings are adequate. It is banking on the tax cuts which began on July 1 to start boosting growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe government will not know whether the tax cuts have worked until the September quarter National Accounts figures are released in early December.\n\nShadow treasurer Jim Chalmers said the states were right to push the Commonwealth to do more.\n\n\"If the Treasurer was doing his job the states wouldn\u2019t be piling on the pressure to bring forward infrastructure investment,'' he said.\n\n\u201cJosh Frydenberg shouldn\u2019t be using this as another opportunity to point the finger or pass the buck to distract from the economic failures of a third-term government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Morrison Government should bring forward the mid-year economic update (from December), and outline a plan to boost the economy and safeguard it from global turbulence.\u201d\n\nMr Frydenberg has previously put pressure on business to help boost productivity by lifting investment.\n\nAt the same time, he is under pressure from Reserve bank Governor Philip Lowe to do more.\n\nMr Frydenberg pointed out that the states should be doing more outside of infrastructure.\n\n\"Lifting Australia's productivity will require the combined effort of the Commonwealth and state governments,'' he said.\n\n\"This is illustrated by the Productivity Commission's Shifting the Dial report which outlined 28 policy recommendations, 22 of which are either the sole or joint responsibilities of the states and territories.''", "description": "Josh Frydenberg has rejected a new push to bring back asset recycling as the state-federal infrastructure stand-off continues.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6237%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_47%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b2798f40f22dbe9cba7390dc3924d9935e363cb5", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
