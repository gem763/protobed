On the phone with Burstyn one recent afternoon, I asked her which poem she\u2019d most recently committed to memory. I expected her to recite the title, or maybe just the name of the poet. \u201cDid you read, by any chance, that beautiful poem in The New York Times Magazine section this week?\u201d I had not. \u201cIf you hold on a minute, I\u2019ll read it to you,\u201d she said. Burstyn put down the phone. A moment later, I heard a little rustling: \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to get it,\u201d she said politely. \u201cJust a minute.\u201d\n\nBurstyn didn\u2019t just read this poem, she performed it for an audience of one. \u201cI can\u2019t pronounce the name of the poet; it looks like Danusha Lam\u00e9ris, L-A-M-E-R-I-S, and it\u2019s called \u2018Small Kindnesses.\u2019 Her last name has an accent over the e.\u201d It\u2019s a few verses about treating one another tenderly, being gentle with strangers. Life is hard, \u201cSmall Kindnesses\u201d says, and we shouldn\u2019t make it any harder on ourselves by missing an opportunity to be gracious. Burstyn took her time as she read it, punctuating some words with passion, whispering others with reverence. Over the phone for the next half-hour, buzzing from her own interview with Al Pacino the previous night for Inside the Actors Studio, Burstyn discussed poetry, staying sharp at 86, and her childhood fantasy of being Betty Grable.\n\nHow are you today?\n\nI\u2019m doing very well. I had a big event last night. I interviewed Al Pacino. We started at 7 and it was supposed to be an hour, and we went till 10. [Laughs.]\n\nI heard! I know someone who went, and it sounded like it was very cool.\n\nIt was for our master\u2019s-degree program, the Actors Studio master\u2019s-degree program at Pace University. It\u2019s part of our curriculum. It\u2019s called a craft seminar. We\u2019ve had the show, Inside the Actors Studio, on the air for close to 20 years. It was hosted by Jim Lipton, who\u2019s retired now, so we now have circulating hosts. Alec Baldwin started hosting, and we\u2019ve had three others. Last night was my turn, and I did Al.\n\nHe\u2019s so brilliant, and he\u2019s just a genius. I just saw the film that he did with Marty Scorsese that\u2019s going to open soon, called The Irishman. That is staggering, it\u2019s so brilliant. Al\u2019s playing Jimmy Hoffa in it. Marty very graciously gave us a scene from it to show last night. Al is just a genius! He\u2019s a little unusual, shall we say. He talks brilliantly, but [in conversation] he comes to many crossroads and takes them. It\u2019s kind of my job to to wrangle him back. It was fun and deep and wonderful, and I just love it. They said they\u2019re going to make two shows out of it.\n\nWhat did you think of the de-aging?\n\nIt was so successful that I didn\u2019t even notice. They looked young and they looked old, but the technology wasn\u2019t anything that jumped out. It\u2019s amazing. I wish they\u2019d invented it for people offscreen.\n\nYou and Al have known each other for a long time, right?\n\nWell, we\u2019re co-presidents of the Actors Studio \u2014 have been for years and years, since Lee Strasberg died [in 1982]. So we\u2019ve known each other. We\u2019re not, you know, bosom buddies, but we have a lot of shared interests and respect and admiration. I mean, that\u2019s how I feel about him, anyway.\n\nIn conversations like that, with someone who does the same work you do but maybe approaches it differently, does it make you reflect on your own process?\n\nNot really that, so much as how hard it is to express what happens. Really, what goes on in the creative process is that you feed data into your psyche and focus on it for as long as necessary, and then if necessary you let go, turn your attention somewhere else. But you\u2019re always with the intention of coming to some understanding about the character. And finally, what happens is the solution rises up from your unconscious and you go, Oh, I get it! But the unconscious is so involved in the creative process, and it\u2019s hard to talk about the unconscious, you know?\n\nMhm.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to be specific about steps, like, This is what I do and then I get that result. That\u2019s what was transpiring last night: Al describing things like walking from uptown, maybe 90th Street, down to the Village, as he\u2019s thinking about The Godfather. He did it every day, and then the answer came to him. You know, it\u2019s so gloriously mysterious when it flowers in you.\n\nI like that.\n\nYou can\u2019t force it, you know. You can only feed it information and then allow it to, in its own time, send up its blissful answers.\n\nIs there a certain place or time of day, maybe, when you feel your unconscious the clearest? Or the strongest?\n\nCertainly in dreams. Dreams are very usable. I can ask a question before I go to sleep and hope to get the answer in a dream, and sometimes I do, but not always. I find when I\u2019m by the ocean, the unconscious is more available. Silence is important; but not silence: solitariness. Being quiet and alone, staring into space, and asking questions: I wonder why she says hello there? That\u2019s funny, I didn\u2019t think she would do that. With that kind of question, you just wait, and then, Oh my God, that\u2019s why! And so, it comes up. It\u2019ll always reveal. I love to go near the ocean when I\u2019m finding a character.\n\nLet\u2019s start talking about Lucy in the Sky \u2014 how did this part come to you?\n\nThey just called my agent and said they wanted me. It wasn\u2019t complicated. It might\u2019ve been Natalie who asked for me, because I knew her before. I didn\u2019t know Noah Hawley. I just flew in and shot it and flew out. Natalie\u2019s so wonderful. I just love spending a little time with her, you know?\n\nI went to the Q&A in Toronto, where she said you were the sharpest actress she\u2019s ever worked with.\n\nIsn\u2019t that lovely? I love the report I got from the screening: It was Natalie and Jon Hamm, and somebody asked her how it was working with me, that I was such a legend, and that she was very complimentary and said something like I was there in the moment, every moment. I told her that I memorized a poem every day to keep my mind sharp and my memory working. Jon Hamm piped up and said, \u201cOh, she told me it was cocaine!\u201d [Laughs.]\n\nSo what is the truth, which is it?\n\nWell, it\u2019s not cocaine, I\u2019ll tell you that! I memorize poetry whenever I\u2019m not working on a role. I love poetry and I read it a lot, and if anybody asks me to speak at an event, I always take that opportunity to recite a poem. I carry a lot of them in my memory. If I feel like it\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve memorized something, I memorize a new poem.\n\nYou have my favorite line reading of the year in Lucy in the Sky: \u201cAll that astronaut dick has made you soft.\u201d\n\nYes! I knew it was funny. The character knew it was funny.\n\nHow did you prepare to play Nan?\n\nI\u2019m trying to remember, because I did three movies in a row last year. My big concern with this role is I remember I loved that she was smoking cigarettes and had an oxygen tank. But I was terrified to inhale smoke because I get bronchitis so easily. I cough very easily if I inhale smoke. So they kept assuring me that I wouldn\u2019t have any trouble with these herbal cigarettes that they got. But I was terrified. Well, terrified is too strong a word. Weary. And then, sure enough, I could smoke those darn cigarettes and inhale them and have no bad side effects at all. So that was a big relief. That was my main preparation: how was it gonna go with those cigarettes.\n\nI had to find her walk, moving into that time where she\u2019s at the end of her life. She lives in a home like that, looking out at the golf course, where people still could move around and she couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s like tamping down all of the energy that I have into a more constricted, quieter ball. I had to allow myself to be frail. But tough, that\u2019s what she was. She was physically frail and emotionally tough, or her character was tough. So I loved her, she was funny!\n\nIt\u2019s funny, because you seem so vivacious, so full of energy. I mean, you did three movies last year!\n\nOh, I\u2019m very grateful that I got to 40 and decided I better pull my act together or I wasn\u2019t gonna live very long. I stopped smoking and I stopped drinking and I stopped the occasional marijuana. I stopped eating meat and just got healthy. Started exercising, which I hadn\u2019t done. And now, 46 years later, I\u2019m so glad I did it because I feel really healthy and strong and I\u2019m still working. I\u2019m actually working more now than I ever did. I look at people that are ten or 15 years younger than I am and can hardly move, and I just came up from the gym where I was lifting weights. I don\u2019t mean to brag. I\u2019m gonna knock on wood; it sounds like I\u2019m bragging \u2026\n\nNo, please brag!\n\nI\u2019m a healthy person and I work at it and I\u2019m thrilled that it pays off.\n\nPart of Lucy in the Sky is about a love triangle, and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve ever been in a love triangle.\n\nOh, at least a triangle, yeah.\n\n\u201cAt least a triangle!\u201d Tell me more.\n\nI\u2019m just being sarcastic. A love triangle, not really. But overlapping relationships where I started one with someone who hadn\u2019t yet ended the other one \u2014 that\u2019s happened a couple of times.\n\nI tried not to do that. I mean, when I was doing that, you know, in that period of my life, I tried to be respectful of people\u2019s relationships. But on occasion there\u2019s, you know, the strong attraction, and the other thing has to be resolved before you can really move forward. You know, what a mess it is. Maybe you don\u2019t. But it\u2019s a mess.\n\nA lot of people\u2019s childhood dream is to be an astronaut. What was yours?\n\nWhat did I want to do when I was a child? Oh, I think I wanted to be Betty Grable. Do you remember who Betty Grable is?\n\nSure, from How to Marry a Millionaire.\n\nWhen I saw movies like The Dolly Sisters, where they wear costumes with sequins and feathers, I thought I\u2019d like to do that, and sing and dance and flirt with Tyrone Power, or one of those handsome men. I don\u2019t think I had very high aspirations. I think I pretty much wanted as much glitter as possible. Only later did I start discovering other aspects of life that were possible ways to go.\n\nBut I must say that acting was always part of me. I did it in school, it\u2019s what I could do well, it\u2019s what I came in with. I tell you, when you come in with something that you can do fairly easily and well, that\u2019s a direction that your genes or fate or the spirits, whoever it is, is pointing you in a direction and you should probably follow it and see if there\u2019s any way you can be of use there.\n\nDo you think of acting, or being an artist, as a vocation? Like a higher or spiritual calling?\n\nTo me, being an artist is such a gift that anybody who comes in with talent of any kind, whether it\u2019s in music or painting or acting or writing, whatever it is, it\u2019s such a gift to be born that way. I am very grateful to live the life of an artist and also to live with other artists. All of my friends are artists. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t feel comfortable with people who aren\u2019t artists, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s that I feel at home with artists. I just think it\u2019s a real blessing.\n\nI know that you are a lifelong Democrat. Have you decided whom you\u2019ll support in 2020?\n\nWell, I like Elizabeth Warren!\n\nMe too.\n\nVery good. I think her policies are sound, I think she\u2019s the woman who\u2019s dedicated her life to helping the middle class. I think she\u2019s saying all the right things. I never thought that she was going to catch on because I heard too many people say she\u2019s too liberal, whatever that means. But she is, and people are listening to her and she\u2019s rising, and I\u2019m really happy about it.\n\nI think she has the best shot. She\u2019s better than Joe Biden by a mile.\n\nI do too. Yeah, I like Joe Biden very much, but he is looking not young enough, isn\u2019t he? And who am I to ever pull age on someone, but you know, I don\u2019t feel he\u2019s still strong enough.\n\nWhat was it about \u201cSmall Kindnesses,\u201d the poem you read me, that resonated with you?\n\nSo much. The fact that we\u2019re cast, \u201cwe\u2019re far from the tribe and the fire,\u201d which connected us in humanity. But even so, that there are these \u201cfleeting temples\u201d \u2014 I love that phrase \u2014 \u201cthese fleeting temples, the true dwelling of the holy,\u201d that we just bring into being with a little kindness to each other, even though we\u2019re strangers. It makes life seem so grounded and spiritual, even though we\u2019re far from the tribe and the fire. I guess that\u2019s what I like about it.\n\nWe\u2019re having a very hard time right now, you know? We\u2019re living in such a dangerous and explosive and brutal, brutal time. The fires raging, and the hurricanes, and the mountains \u2014 people needing shelter and people closing the doors to them because they can\u2019t handle any more in their shelter. It\u2019s really unlike anything any of us have ever experienced. It\u2019s new on the planet. So I guess we have to make more of an effort to remember to be kind even to strangers. Maybe especially to strangers.\n\nThank you for reading that.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s a pleasure to give a poem like that to someone.
