The Fund seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the long-term sector of the U.S. Treasury market as \"defined by the Barclays Capital 20+ Year Treasury Index\".\n\nLet's look at a number of charts to get some perspective on this investment arena.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of the TLT, below, we can see that prices have climbed dramatically from an early November low. Prices are above the rising 50-day simple moving average line and above the bullish 200-day line.\n\nThe 50-day average crossed above the 200-day line in late January for what is commonly called a golden cross. This is a long-term buy signal that typically only works well in trending markets. It is also typically late but in this case it provided followers a great entry point.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been climbing with the price action and confirms the price gains.\n\nThe 12-day price momentum study is not showing any meaning slowing in this rally.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of TLT, below, we can see that prices have broken above the 2016 highs. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line. The OBV line is bullish and price momentum has not slowed.\n\nIn this monthly bar chart of TLT, below, we can see a longer-term uptrend from 2004. Obviously this is not a new trend and fighting it has been an expensive lesson.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of TLT, below, we can see that a potential upside price target of $220 is being projected.\n\nIn this monthly line chart of the 10-year Treasury yield, below, we can see that the 1.50% area has represented \"support\" since 2012. With the yield on the 10-year below 1.50% now, the next 1/4-point benchmark is 1.25% and then 1.00%. Looking at government yields around the world these targets are not hard to imagine.\n\nBottom line strategy: We live in interesting times and it is not hard for me, at least, to imagine yields falling still lower in the weeks ahead. I would stay long the TLT and not be in any rush to pick a top, or worse, shorting this instrument because you believe rates cannot stay this low.", "description": "Let's look at a number of charts to get some perspective on this investment arena....TLT", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "How Low Can Treasury Yields Fall In The U.S.", "Let'S Look At A Number Of Charts To Get Some Perspective On This Investment Arena.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jonathan Heller", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/202f2b28-7be5-11e9-9035-19dd25868aaa.jpg"}
