Mandatory Credit: Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs quarterback went from writhing in pain during his previous game, to being helped to the sideline, to having a dislocated kneecap popped into place, to walking into the locker room, to reportedly being out three weeks, to practicing Wednesday.\n\nThe next step could signal a football miracle if Mahomes plays Sunday against the visiting Green Bay Packers in a prime-time matchup.\n\nAdditional evaluation is needed to make a further determination of when Mahomes will return to action, but his presence on the practice field certainly displays his toughness and leadership.\n\n\u201cAfter it happened, he thought he could go back in,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said of the injury Mahomes sustained in a 30-6 win at Denver on Oct. 17. \u201cThat\u2019s how he\u2019s wired. ... He attacks everything. That\u2019s how he goes about it. He\u2019s been full steam ahead.\u201d\n\nKansas City (5-2) will, nonetheless, need to summon every ounce of fortitude against Green Bay (6-1) and its standout quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, who is coming off a perfect passer rating in a 42-24 win over the Oakland Raiders.\n\nAfter stretching and jogging Wednesday in his first practice since the injury, Mahomes did some handoffs and executed simple throws. The backup used in the Denver win, Matt Moore, also participated in drills along with Chad Henne and Kyle Shurmur. Henne has been out with a broken ankle and cannot be activated until next week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a tricky deal right now,\u201d said Moore, an 11th-year veteran who didn\u2019t play anywhere last season and hadn\u2019t taken a first-team rep with the Chiefs before replacing Mahomes against the Broncos. Moore fired a 57-yard touchdown to Tyreek Hill while passing for 117 yards.\n\nDeclining to rule out Mahomes for this week, Reid said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to try and take it day to day, and at the same time make sure Matt\u2019s ready to play.\u201d\n\nThe experience possessed by Moore, who quarterbacked the Miami Dolphins in the 2016 playoffs, makes the Chiefs \u201clucky to have him,\u201d Reid added.\n\nMahomes leads the NFL with 2,180 passing yards and has thrown one interception in 241 attempts.\n\nRodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week after passing for 429 yards and five touchdowns and compiling a perfect 158.3 rating in the rout of Oakland.\n\nFirst-year Green Bay coach Matt LaFleur, however, deflected any talk about perfection as a team.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never going to be a perfect game,\u201d LaFleur said, \u201cand there\u2019s always room for improvement. That\u2019s always going to be the constant theme. ...\n\n\u201cAll I know is we\u2019re going to Kansas City this week, and they\u2019re a damn good football team.\u201d\n\nPackers wide receiver Davante Adams went through practice warmups early in the week after injuring his right toe against Philadelphia in Week 4, and he is day-to-day. Safety Darnell Savage (ankle) returned to practice.\n\nThree key starters for Kansas City \u2014 offensive tackle Eric Fisher (groin), wide receiver Sammy Watkins (hamstring) and defensive tackle Chris Jones (groin) \u2014 received optimistic assessments from Reid.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Patrick Mahomes made one thing obvious during the course of a week.
