Analysts said it is likely the move was partly driven by the weakness of the pound.\n\nThe board of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) Group responded to the approach on Friday, four days after receiving it, saying it \u201cunanimously rejects the conditional proposal and, given its fundamental flaws, sees no merit in further engagement\u201d.\n\nIn a letter to HKEX, the LSE wrote that it does not see strategic merit for the group in the tie-up, and that regulatory and government support for the deal is \u201chighly uncertain\u201d.\n\nWill Howlett, an analyst at Quilter Cheviot, echoed these doubts in a comment on the HKEX\u2019s proposal. He noted \u201creal risk that politics would disrupt this deal, with the UK \u2018losing\u2019 an industry leader, particularly at a time when Brexit may elevate such sensitivities\u201d.\n\nThe LSE also criticised the amount on the table, saying the offer significantly undervalues the group. It added that three-quarters of the \u00a331.6bn bid was made up of HKEX shares whose value it called \u201cinherently uncertain\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing situation in Hong Kong adds to this uncertainty,\u201d the LSE wrote.\n\nMassive and increasingly violent protests against a proposed extradition law have rocked Hong Kong since June. The legislation would allow criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China to stand trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party. In contrast, Hong Kong has an independent judiciary.\n\nThe unrest has continued despite the leader of Hong Kong formally scrapping the extradition bill, as the demonstrations have broadened into wider calls for democracy.", "description": "The London Stock Exchange Group has soundly rejected a \u00a332bn takeover bid from its Hong Kong counterpart, listing a host of reasons including the protracted protests in Hong Kong.Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) surprised markets on Wednesday by announcing that it had offered to buy the London", "authors": ["Olesya Dmitracova"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2D.BN02NY0VVpGWt.zjLLw--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/2f3e888e3312fcf0a457f142542d85aa", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
