The first carrier, the Liaoning, is a refurbished ex-Soviet vessel.\n\nThe Liaoning could carry twenty-four J-15 fighters. The Type 001A can carry thirty-six J-15s plus various support aircraft and helicopters, according to Chinese media.\n\n\u201cAlthough the second carrier known as the Type 001A is similar to the Liaoning, it has an optimized flight deck, reduced weapon areas and a smaller superstructure with added deck areas,\u201d a Chinese naval expert told China\u2019s state-owned Global Times. \u201cIt also has an enlarged hanger, but reduced space for missile storage compared to the Liaoning.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Global Times suggested that twenty-four J-15s on the Liaoning \u201ccould be a limit factor as a regional combat might require about 40 aircraft in order to seize air supremacy. The 36 fighter jets on the Type 001A would greatly expand its combat capability.\u201d\n\nBut Global Times also noted that the United States \u201coperates much larger aircraft carriers, including the Nimitz-class which can carry about 60 aircraft, while the country's latest Ford-class can carry about 75.\u201d\n\nWhere China\u2019s inexperience with building and operating aircraft carriers is seen by critics as a drawback, Hu Wenming, chairman of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation and head of China's aircraft carrier program, suggested that Chinese shipbuilders are both mature\u2014and youthful\u2014at the same time.\n\n\u201cChina now has a mature development and construction team, and the average age of team members is only 36,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever type of aircraft carrier our country wants to develop in the future, we can make it on our own,\u201d\n\n\u201cIt took only 26 months to build and launch the Type 001A, which is China's first domestically developed aircraft carrier, almost half of the time for a foreign aircraft carrier of similar type to finish construction,\u201d Chinese state-owned broadcaster CCTV added.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "It's not all about size.", "authors": ["Michael Peck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/esgMwTO.0EI9NZs6TsXcEQ--~B/aD04Mjg7dz0xMzI3O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/0b58256e30f45db1f29148e6e2689f75", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
