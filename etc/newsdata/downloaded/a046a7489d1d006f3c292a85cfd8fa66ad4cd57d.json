Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Tuesday pointed to global warming as a major cause of Hurricane Dorian, which has pummeled the Bahamas with devastating winds and massive flooding and is slowly churning toward the coast of Florida.\n\nIn a tweet, the Democratic presidential candidate slammed the fossil fuel industry for wreaking havoc on the environment, arguing that it \u201ccreates death and destruction, then spends billions denying its responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us be clear: Hurricane Dorian has everything to do with climate change, which is the existential crisis of our time,\u201d he added.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry is now the equivalent of the tobacco industry. It creates death and destruction, then spends billions denying its responsibility.\n\n\n\nLet us be clear: Hurricane Dorian has everything to do with climate change, which is the existential crisis of our time. https://t.co/TBLiIcKb1W \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) September 3, 2019\n\nSanders\u2019 remarks were spurred by a New York Times op-ed on worsening hurricanes, which was shared by the New Consensus, a liberal think tank helping to develop the Green New Deal. Sander\u2019s is a co-sponsor of a version of the Green New Deal. which proposes a broad range of environmental and economic initiatives and has been closely linked to freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\nAs of Tuesday, Dorian had wound down from a Category 5 storm to a Category 2. It was initially able to gain significant force by feeding on warm ocean waters. Though it may be too early to determine the exact impact of climate change on the hurricane\u2019s development, the warming of the planet\u2019s oceans seems to have fueled upticks in the intensity of hurricanes. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, more than 90% of Earth\u2019s warming over the last 50 years has occurred in the planet\u2019s oceans, where heat is absorbed much more readily than on land.\n\nThe 2018 National Climate Assessment, published by the federally mandated U.S. Global Change Research Program, pointed to the rise in greenhouse gasses as a contributing factor in triggering hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean region.\n\nIt also attributed the intensity of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season to \u201ca combination of natural and human-caused\u201d elements. That year\u2019s hurricanes included Harvey, Irma, Jose and Maria \u2015 each of which reached Category 5 or 4 intensity.", "description": "The Democratic presidential candidate warned of global warming's potential contribution to the storm's development.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ed3fd3b0000e000cc0522.jpeg?cache=4zjxmxpx8h&ops=1778_1000"}
