Energy Secretary Rick Perry said he contacted Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani at the president\u2019s behest to talk about Ukraine\u2014and then resigned. And European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland told House investigators that Trump had delegated power over U.S. foreign policy in Ukraine to Giuliani, and added that it was \u201cwrong\u201d to link political requests to actions on Ukraine.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how Trump\u2019s mounting troubles will affect the impeachment proceedings in Congress. Even if the Democratic House votes to impeach the President, the Republican-controlled Senate must vote to convict him in order to remove him from office. But the events of the past 24 hours have turned up the pressure on an increasingly embattled Trump.\n\nIn the White House briefing room Thursday, Mulvaney publicly confirmed that Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate Democratic Party actions during the 2016 election in exchange for releasing the flow of military aid. \u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing he was worried about in corruption with that nation, and that is absolutely appropriate,\u201d Mulvaney said, explaining why the aid to Ukraine was delayed. \u201cGet over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he also mention to me in [the] past the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely,\u201d Mulvaney said, confirming that Trump had also brought up the debunked conspiracy that Ukrainian individuals were involved in the investigation into the Russian hacking of the DNC server in 2016. \u201cNo question about that. But that\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s senior-most aide announced publicly that political considerations influenced Trump\u2019s foreign policy, Trump allies scrambled to do damage control. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Jay Sekulow told TIME Trump\u2019s legal counsel \u201cwas not involved\u201d in Mulvaney\u2019s briefing, and a senior official in the Department of Justice also distanced DOJ from Mulvaney\u2019s comments. \u201cIf the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us,\u201d the official wrote in a statement.\n\nThe reaction was swift. Within hours, Mulvaney had walked back his comments, repeatedly asserting that the White House decision to hold up nearly $400 million in military aid had nothing to do with an investigation into hacking the Democratic National Committee\u2019s server and whether that server ended up in Ukraine. \u201cLet me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThere never was any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server.\u201d Mulvaney\u2019s carefully-worded statement pointedly did not mention any other investigations into Democrats, including Trump\u2019s fixation on Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company that once employed former Vice President Biden\u2019s son.\n\nWhile Mulvaney said during the press briefing that the delay in military aid \u201chad absolutely nothing to do with Biden,\u201d his subsequent statement did not mention Burisma or Biden at all. The omission was conspicuous in part because text messages made public by House investigators last week made it clear that Ukrainian officials believed that the White House visit they sought was dependent on their opening a probe into both the DNC server and Burisma. \u201cOnce we have a date we will call for a press briefing,\u201d a Zelensky aide texted the U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker. The briefing would announce \u201camong other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations,\u201d he wrote. Volker responded, \u201cSounds great!\u201d\n\nWhile Mulvaney\u2019s comments exploded onto cable news chyrons, Trump\u2019s hand-picked ambassador to the European Union, GOP donor Gordon Sondland, began speaking to House investigators. He told them it would have been \u201cwrong\u201d to withhold military aid in an effort to pressure Ukraine to take on a political investigation. \u201cLet me state clearly: Inviting a foreign government to undertake investigations for the purpose of influencing an upcoming U.S. election would be wrong,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cWithholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong. I did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s not yet clear how Trump\u2019s mounting troubles will affect the impeachment proceedings in Congress.", "authors": ["Brian Bennett"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GTyx6TZH1JSo8aqzGxVrmw--~B/aD03MTQ7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/8b7918e8a9e48ecaa6b7fd2c5960d17e", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
