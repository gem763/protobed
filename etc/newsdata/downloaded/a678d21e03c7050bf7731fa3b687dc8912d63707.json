Buzz60\u2019s Maria Mercedes Galuppo has more. Buzz60\n\nIt's OK, Pisces, you can open your eyes now.\n\nFor film enthusiasts who love all things Halloween, October means candy, costumes and, most importantly, horror flicks. But with all the terrifying features out there, where should you start your spooky movie binge?\n\nAccording to celebrity astrologer Michele Knight, the Zodiac (the calendar, not the killer) can give you a clue.\n\nA horror fan herself, Knight is a psychic and astrologer whose celebrity clientele includes Russell Brand, Leona Lewis and Sharon Osbourne.\n\nFor Knight, your astrological birth chart encompasses \"a map of the soul\" \u2013 and your deepest fears.\n\n\"There are certain things that will scare the bejesus out of certain signs,\" Knight says. For instance, \"Cancerians are all about the family. If they're watching a horror film about the family, oh, my God, it's going to freak them out.\"\n\nWho knew? Glenn Close is totally down for a 'Fatal Attraction' remake, with one major change\n\nThough she advises against watching horror frequently, Knight says the desire for the occasional scare \"is in our primal DNA.\"\n\n\"Halloween is very important. It allows us to face our fear of death and face our fears of being out of control,\" she says. But a caveat: \"Don't do it all the time. Do it as like a once-a-year thing to cleanse yourself of your fear, to indulge in your fear, to indulge in your shadow.\"\n\nKnight outlines what, in her professional opinion, the scariest movies are for each sign. Read on, if you dare.\n\nHalloween costume ideas: What you should be based on your zodiac sign\n\nA group of teens (including, from left, Fran Kranz, Chris Hemsworth and Anna Hutchison) venture to a cabin in the woods.

If any kind of movie satisfies an Aries, it's one that shows characters determined to survive and that have a clear winner.\n\nThe classic 1979 sci-fi thriller \"Alien,\" for instance, which follows Sigourney Weaver in a fight for her life against a monster from outer space, is another great Aries choice.\n\nAlso try: 2009's \"Drag Me to Hell,\" about a loan officer who becomes cursed after evicting an old woman from her home. \"An Aries often gets in trouble for their big mouth,\" Knight says, \"but they will fight like hell to survive.\"\n\nThe famous 'chestbuster' scene: New 'Alien' documentary shows the funny, phallic origins\n\nA relaxing bath comes with a terrifying twist in 1984's \"A Nightmare on Elm Street.\" (Photo: Courtesy of New Line Cinema)\n\nTaurus\n\nThese earth signs love a good throwback. Knight recommends horror classics like 1996's \"Scream\" or 1984's \"A Nightmare on Elm Street.\"\n\n\"Taurus are naturally attached to retro horror and films they loved when they were young,\" she advises.\n\nAlso try: When it comes to relationships, meeting the family \"is also a big deal\" for a Taurus, Knight adds. Check out films that give this situation a terrifying twist, like 2017's \"Get Out.\"\n\nThe Mothership podcast: We're celebrating Halloween with Freddy Krueger\n\nIn an iconic scene from the 1980 horror classic \"The Shining,\" twins make an ominous appearance down a narrow hallway. (Photo: Courtesy of Warner Bros.)\n\nGemini\n\nGemini may be the sign of the twins, but duos can seriously freak them out.\n\n\"The astrological twins fear twins!\" says Knight, recommending scary Gemini fare \"where doppelg\u00e4ngers rule,\" like 1980's \"The Shining\" and this year's \"Us.\"\n\nAlso try: This air sign is also known for its multiple personalities, Knight notes, so 2017's \"Split\" is another frightful choice.\n\n'I'm a truth seeker in my work': Jordan Peele embraces his latest role with 'Us'\n\nToni Collette plays a mother haunted by family secrets in \"Hereditary.\" (Photo: A24 VIA AP)\n\nCancer\n\n\"Home is where the heart is for Cancer,\" Knight says. So horror films involving families, like \"Hereditary,\" will definitely make waves with this emotionally intuitive water sign.\n\nAlso try: Movies that show kids in danger or put a sadistic spin on a mother relationship will also upset \"sensitive souls\" like the nurturing Cancers. Think 2018's \"A Quiet Place,\" 2019's \"Ma\" and 1960's \"Psycho.\"\n\n'Hereditary' hype is real: It's insanely scary and impossible to shake off\n\n\"It Follows\" stars Maika Monroe as a girl hunted by a supernatural force. (Photo: RADIUS)\n\nLeo\n\nWhich scary movies pair best with the sign of the lion? The 1982 film \"Cat People\" is \"the ideal horror because it involves felines, is sexy as hell and a cool '80s classic,\" says Knight.\n\nKnight also recommends Hitchcock's 1963 film \"The Birds,\" \"where the birds bite back \u2013 no lion is happy with that!\"\n\nAlso try: Because the fire sign is known for confidence, Knight also suggests 2015's \"It Follows,\" in which the only way to stop a supernatural force from killing you is by passing it on to someone else through sex. (Yes, you read that correctly. It's basically about a demonic STD.)\n\nFrom 'Addams Family' to 'Zombieland': 10 terrifying horror movies you must see this October\n\nVirgo\n\nCan't leave the house without hand sanitizer? You're probably a Virgo.\n\nSince this tidy, detail-oriented earth sign is known for being germophobic, Knight recommends \"any virus movie,\" such as 2011's \"Contagion.\"\n\nAlso try: Brad Pitt's \"World War Z,\" where Virgos \"can relate to a hero saving the world from disease,\" is another terrifying option, Knight says.\n\nLibra\n\nThis air sign is all about keeping the peace, so Knight says movies about chaos will drive Libras insane.\n\n\"Libras love harmony and balance, so are freaked out and adore movies like (1990's) 'Misery,' where to survive they have to try to calm an out-of-control bad guy,\" she says.\n\nAlso try: Additionally, because of their affinity for harmony, a movie like 2014's \"No Good Deed\" where \"nice personalities are not rewards\" will also set Libras on edge.\n\nVera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson lead \"The Conjuring\" franchise as a pair of paranormal investigators.

A \"Halloween\" series binge session, anyone?\n\n\"Scorpios are the biggest horror fans in the world, because they live in the underworld,\" Knight says. \"They're happy with the shadow.\" Anything supernatural like 2013's \"The Conjuring\" or 1982's \"Poltergeist\" will keep the intense Scorpios intrigued, she says.\n\nAlso try:Zombie movies are also strongly encouraged.\n\nAppreciation: Vera Farmiga mourns death of Lorraine Warren, 92, who inspired her 'Conjuring' character\n\nFar from civilization, a family becomes terrorized by a group of mutant cannibals in the 2006 remake of the 1977 horror classic \"The Hills Have Eyes.\" (Photo: LACEY TERRELL/FOX SEARCHLIGHT PICTURES)\n\nSagittarius\n\nPeople born under this fire sign are independent-minded explorers who march to the beat of their own drum. According to Knight, however, Sagittarius' affinity for travel makes them susceptible to particular frights.\n\nSagittarius \"love to hate\" films that give trips a dark twist, like 2005's \"Wolf Creek\" and 2003's \"Wrong Turn,\" she says.\n\nAlso try: 1977's \"The Hills Have Eyes\" and 2006's \"Hostel.\"\n\nChristian Bale plays murderous investment banking executive Patrick Bateman in \"American Psycho.\" (Photo: KERRY HAYES, XXX LIONS GATE FILMS)\n\nCapricorn\n\nKnown for their efficiency and drive, people born under this earth sign take great pride in their work.\n\nFor Capricorns, Knight recommends horror \"connected to work or career\" \u2013 where your \"colleague could be a serial killer\" or when \"a work away day goes hideously wrong.\" Think 2000's \"American Psycho\" and 2007's \"Severance.\"\n\nAlso try: 2015's \"The Voices\" starring Ryan Reynolds.\n\nThe 1999 thriller \"The Sixth Sense\" includes an iconic plot twist. (Photo: RON PHILLIPS/SPYGLASS ENTERTAINMENT)\n\nAquarius\n\nPeople born under this intellectual air sign go for the intelligent slasher pic or thriller, according to Knight.\n\n\"Scary psychological thrillers and science-fiction horror grab these air signs,\" says Knight, suggesting 2003's \"Gothika,\" 1992's \"The Lawnmower Man\" and 2002's \"Resident Evil.\"\n\nAlso try: Movies with cunning psychological twists like 1999's \"The Sixth Sense\" and 1987's \"Fatal Attraction.\"\n\nMovie trivia: Donnie Wahlberg starved for Vincent Gray in 'Sixth Sense,' wanted to play him naked\n\n\"The Shape of Water\" follows an interspecies romance. (Photo: Fox Searchlight)\n\nPisces\n\nHonestly, the sensitive Pisces probably shouldn't be watching horror films at all.\n\n\"They don't like horror,\" Knight says of the creative water sign. \"They cannot do it. They should not.\"\n\nHowever, if a Pisces does decide to endure a scary movie, one should opt for \"gentle horror\" where the thrills are more emotional. These movies include 2016's \"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\" and recent best-picture Oscar winner \"The Shape of Water.\"\n\n\"You can talk to any Pisces,\" Knight says. \"They don't want to watch scary horror, because it traumatizes them. They like nice, romantic horror.\"\n\nAlso try: \"Twilight.\" (It may not technically be a horror film, but a supernatural romance with high stakes feels plenty scary for a Pisces.)\n\n'Twilight' turns 10:How Bella and Edward's girl-meets-vampire love story changed Hollywood\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/22/halloween-horror-scopes-scary-movies-based-on-your-sign/4013484002/", "description": "Celebrity astrologer Michele Knight says the Zodiac (the calendar, not the killer) determines your best Halloween horror film recommendations.", "authors": ["Charles Trepany", "Published P.M.
