This escalation in ceasefire violations by India is continuing from 2017 when the Indian forces committed more than 1970 ceasefire violations, the FO noted.\n\n\u201cPakistan categorically rejects Indian media reports about so-called \u201claunchpads\u201d being targeted by India along the LoC.\u201d\n\nThe statement said that earlier, highlighting the Indian threat to regional peace and security, Pakistan has called upon the P5 to ask India to provide information about the so-called alleged \u201claunchpads\u201d and stated its willingness to arrange a visit of the P5 diplomats to those locations to expose Indian falsehood.\n\n\u201cHeinous Indian targeting of civilians is a typical attempt by India to divert international attention from the humanitarian nightmare in occupied Jammu and Kashmir,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe deliberate targeting of civilian populated areas is indeed deplorable and contrary to human dignity, International Human Rights and Humanitarian Laws. The ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Dr. Mohammad Faisal, summoned the Indian Deputy Envoy Gaurav Ahluwalia on Sunday and condemned the unprovoked ceasefire violations by New Dehli", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/11903588681571570816.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
