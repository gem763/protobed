You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut does it really matter? And who to?\n\n13 billion\n\nThe not-so-gradual demise of cash is well documented. UK Finance, the trade body that represents the banking and finance industry, calculates that in 2007 more than 60 per cent of all transactions were in cash.\n\nJust 10 years later the figure was down to 34 per cent \u2013 the same year that debit card transactions took over as our preferred method of payment for the first time.\n\nBy 2027, cash will account for barely one in every 10 transactions.\n\nBut the chances of us being completely cashless anytime soon remains unlikely. At least, the 1.3 million people in the UK who still don\u2019t have a bank account must hope so, along with the 2.2 million people who rely on cash for their everyday spending. That\u2019s 4 per cent of the adult population.\n\nEven last year, 13 billion transactions were still made in cash, according to Sarah John, chief cashier for the Bank of England.\n\n\u201cThose most reliant on cash tend to be from lower household incomes, with over half having total household incomes of less than \u00a310,000 per year,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThe tangibility of cash is a key benefit, allowing them to physically calculate and budget their spending. Digital payments do not yet work for everyone.\n\n\u201cTechnological advances in payments have the power to support financial inclusion. But they currently tend to be designed for the mass market rather than for vulnerable groups, meaning vulnerable groups are rarely early adopters of new payment offerings.\u201d\n\nPaying for the privilege\n\nAnd yet consumer group Which? this week revealed that deprived areas are losing free cash machines at a much faster rate than affluent ones, forcing thousands of people in poorer communities to pay up to \u00a32 per withdrawal to use the growing number of pay-to-use machines now quickly replacing the free ones.\n\nWhich? analysis of data from Link \u2013 the UK\u2019s biggest ATM network \u2013 shows one in 10 free cashpoints across the country closed or switched to a fee-paying one in a 17-month period after major changes to how the network is funded.\n\nCost in the community\n\nAmong the hardest hit are Birmingham\u2019s Ladywood constituency, where 47 free machines closed in less than a year and a half, followed by Bristol West, Manchester Central, Belfast South and Cardiff Central \u2013 all constituencies with a large proportion of deprived areas whose residents are most likely to rely on cash.\n\nWhile some communities in cities and towns can lose a few cashpoints and still have a reasonable level of access to free-to-use ATMs, people in less well-served and rural areas that have seen a spike in the percentage of fee-paying machines are more likely to be left with no option but to pay to withdraw cash.\n\nIn Great Yarmouth, for example, half the cash machines will now charge up to \u00a32 to allow residents and visitors access to their own money. It\u2019s a similar situation in Vauxhall in London, and Blaenau Gwent.\n\nOverall, Which? found that the most deprived areas across the UK saw a reduction of 979 free-to-use machines in that 17-month period alone \u2013 equivalent to 6 per cent of their ATM network.\n\nWhich?, along with the Independent Access to Cash Review, has this week called on chancellor Sajid Javid to take action to guarantee people\u2019s ability to access and pay with cash as digital payments grow in popularity.\n\nThe consumer group is concerned that measures put in place by Link and the banking industry to help those in deprived or isolated areas just won\u2019t do the job adequately enough long-term.\n\nWhich? believes the Payment Systems Regulator must urgently take control of how cashpoints are funded to address the rapid reduction in free cash access across the UK.\n\nThe regulator must ensure those still reliant on cash aren\u2019t forced to pay because of the double blow of bank branch and cashpoint closures and an alarming shift to fee-charging machines, Which? warns.\n\n\u201cA year ago, leaders in Sweden \u2013 the most cashless society in the world \u2013 warned us to act now to stop the UK sleepwalking into a cashless society,\u201d said Natalie Ceeney, the independent chair of the Access to Cash Review.\n\n\u201cSix months ago, we presented recommendations of what steps should be taken to make sure no one was left behind. With ATM numbers declining, cash use dropping, and more and more shops not accepting cash, our fear is that the UK will fast go cashless, leaving millions of people behind.\u201d", "description": "This week saw another milestone reached in the journey towards a cashless UK with news that consumers now spend more money on credit cards alone than they do in hard cash.\u00a0 While that may say quite a lot about our debt crisis, it\u2019s also another nail in the cash coffin.\u00a0 Physical money now forms just \u00a31 in every \u00a35 spent with UK retailers, according to data from the British", "authors": ["Kate Hughes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/12/13/cash-machine.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
