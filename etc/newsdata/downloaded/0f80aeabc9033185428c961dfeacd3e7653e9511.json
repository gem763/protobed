FiveThirtyEight\u2019s impeachment tracker, which aggregates the polling from a number of outlets, puts support for impeachment at about 47%, with opposition at about 45%. At the beginning of September, average support stood at about 39%, with opposition near 53%.\n\nThe polling doesn\u2019t offer a total consensus about exactly who are changing their minds on impeachment. A number of surveys, including initial HuffPost/YouGov polling, found that the movement was due mostly to Democrats, who followed their party\u2019s leaders in coalescing around support for an inquiry. Others, however, also found rising support among independents or even Republicans.\n\nDemocratic backing for impeachment is increasingly verging on the universal, with most polls finding three-quarters or more in support. In the most recent Quinnipiac survey, 90% of Democratic voters said Trump \u201cshould be impeached and removed from office,\u201d and 95% favored the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. If support for impeachment is to continue to grow much further, it\u2019ll also need to make inroads beyond just the party \u2015 a path that\u2019s complicated by the already-polarized reactions to Trump\u2019s conversation with the leader of Ukraine.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ariel Edwards-Levy", "Huffpost.Com Entry"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
