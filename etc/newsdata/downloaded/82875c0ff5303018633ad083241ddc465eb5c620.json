The Guardian spoke to female MPs about the intimidation they face, including Paula Sherriff \u2013 whose speech about Cox and the threats she receives was dismissed as \u201chumbug\u201d by the prime minister in the House of Commons.\n\nPaula Sherriff, Labour MP for Dewsbury\n\n\u2018I have had so many, too many, threats to detail\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paula Sherriff.

Since I confronted the prime minister on language, we have already had to report two or three to the police. You just can\u2019t take any chances.\n\n\u201cThe abuse is virtually constant, certainly on social media. It does peak and trough according to what\u2019s going on in parliament. It started with the referendum. Brexit really seems to have empowered some people who feel this sort of language, and these sorts of threats, have become legitimised.\n\n\u201cIt can be tough. Let\u2019s be absolutely clear, we are very resilient. I reject those saying we are snowflakes and weak. Quite the opposite. We are very, very tough. To be a female MP, certainly in a marginal seat, isn\u2019t easy. The vast majority of us accept robust debate comes as part of our role, as well as constructive criticism. Unfortunately, so many cross the line with threats of violence, and sexual violence, and some are really offensive. I have had so many just this afternoon. One said \u2018you fat twat\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt can be wearing. You try to balance it against the good work you are doing and the supportive messages. You try to remember these people are quite sad really, keyboard warriors who take to the computer and start sending these toxic rants.\n\n\u201cI think you become a little bit inured to it. You must, because when I tell people outside politics that I probably had over 1,000 messages overnight, and maybe 200 were really, really offensive, people respond: \u2018Oh my God\u2019. Genuinely, I am quite matter-of-fact about it.\n\n\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t shock me in the way it might have done three years ago when I did sometimes cry when I saw them. But now I rarely do. Now, it makes me feel angry, and it makes me feel really sad about where we are as a society, because I don\u2019t want the widespread feeling that it\u2019s just OK to abuse your MP, or indeed anybody in public office.\n\n\u201cI do fear with an election looming, it could get worse. I think everybody does. Jess Phillips tweeted that she is not worried about an election, she is worried that somebody will kill her. You have to ask, what the hell is going on?\u201d\n\nTulip Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn\n\n\u2018The abuse comes in all forms\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tulip Siddiq. Photograph: Felix Clay/The Guardian\n\n\u201cAbuse is directed pretty much at all politicians. But if you are also female and from an ethnic minority background, the abuse has a different angle. And that has become worse since the referendum.\n\n\u201cYou are not just a \u2018traitor\u2019, you are a \u2018coloured traitor\u2019. It\u2019s not just about \u2018betraying\u2019 the country, it\u2019s about \u2018betraying the country that gave you a safe home\u2019. And then the old chestnut \u2018go home\u2019; \u2018If you\u2019re not going to deliver Brexit, go home\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe language people use matters. It matters that in the chamber the language [is] of traitors, of surrendering, of betrayal. But the language outside [the chamber], such as \u2018letterboxes\u2019, about painting the referendum as a proxy vote on immigration, that matters as well.\n\n\u201cThe abuse comes in all forms. It\u2019s not just from the general public, it\u2019s from the media as well. One article was headlined: \u2018Where do her loyalties really lie?\u2019 I was born in London, I\u2019m a politician in London, I grew up in London. What do you mean where do my loyalties really lie?\n\n\u201cThe abuse is on Twitter, in emails and in letters. I have had death threats, and they have been reported to the police.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that I am a lot more careful now than I was when I first started. That has a lot to do with the fact that Jo [Cox] was murdered. I think all of us were a little bit complacent before.\n\n\u201cWill an election make it any worse? Whether it\u2019s an election, or a campaign, it\u2019s about the tone that people from all sides take, especially at the top. The tone that the prime minister takes. It\u2019s about the general conduct. I think at election time, yes, of course, there is heightened emotion. There is more scrutiny of politicians. I think things are so tense at the moment, that can an election make it get any worse? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nRushanara Ali, Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Bow\n\n\u2018Politics of hate has been allowed to take centre stage\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rushanara Ali. Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\u201cLast year, I received one of those \u2018Punish a Muslim\u2019 letters which a number of people received. It contained a red liquid substance. It was horrible. I had to call the parliamentary police, who brought in a specialist team.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to leave my office for a couple of hours while the liquid was analysed. The perpetrator was recently jailed for 12 years. When these things happen, it\u2019s hugely disruptive in all sorts of ways and all you want to do is just put it behind you and get on with the job but, equally, I feel we need to speak out about these threats.\n\n\u201cThreats and intimidation are not new to me \u2013 I\u2019m dealing with a very serious case at the moment which is with the CPS \u2013 but it has increasingly become commonplace for so many of us across parliament.\n\n\u201cThey are now even more widespread, and how could it be otherwise? We have a prime minister using language deliberately designed to incite violence and hatred.\n\n\u201cA lack of a moral compass among political leaders is dangerous, and yet the prime minister is leading the charge, deliberately causing chaos and putting people\u2019s lives at risk. That\u2019s what really worries me.\n\n\u201cThere are no boundaries now: the politics of hate has been allowed to take centre stage. Once we start to drive a wedge between people and bring the language of the far right into the mainstream, it becomes extremely difficult to undo the damage.\n\n\u201cSince the 2016 referendum, it does feel like threats have become more serious and more dangerous. What worries me most now is that we\u2019ve got certain public figures amplifying these tensions: it\u2019s one thing dealing with people directly threatening you but quite another when their hatred and anger is fuelled by political rhetoric.\u201d\n\nLuciana Berger, Liberal Democrat MP for Liverpool Wavertree\n\n\u2018The threats are never-ending\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Luciana Berger Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe threats come all the time. Because I\u2019m Jewish and a young woman, I have always had a disproportionate level of it but it\u2019s got worse. My security has been considerably ramped up to protect me physically and I try to insulate myself against the online abuse by being careful when I look at my emails, Facebook or my Twitter streams. But the threats are never-ending: you can\u2019t avoid them altogether.\n\n\u201cThe threats range from sinister and abusive to physically threatening. Ninety percent of the perpetrators are men but sometimes you can\u2019t tell: I got an email the other week to my parliamentary office that had been through such sophisticated malware that the police couldn\u2019t trace where it had come from.\n\n\u201cWe have to report threats to the police at least once a week. They called me yesterday about an ongoing case and I had to ask them to tell me which specific one they were calling about, there are so many. There have been six people convicted for harassment and threats directed at me, and there are more cases in the pipeline. Two people have been sent to prison, one of them for four years, one was given community service and one a suspended sentence.\n\n\u201cThe threats are toxic and they permeate our parliamentary debates. That\u2019s the norm today and it\u2019s given permission to those outside the chamber to amplify their hatred and abuse.\n\n\u201cWe have a prime minister and attorney general who boom toxic, divisive soundbites that are immediately posted on social media by the far right. It\u2019s a deliberate and planned strategy: someone behind the scenes is saying this will create the chaos we need to get the policies through that we want.\u201d", "description": "As Boris Johnson is criticised for his divisive comments, MPs shed light on the intimidation they have suffered", "authors": ["Amelia Hill", "Caroline Davies", "As Told To"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2f2665f7fdd59c143245969a9ca5ad5b4719602/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=10fbc485ea479296e7175bd305b8fb92", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
