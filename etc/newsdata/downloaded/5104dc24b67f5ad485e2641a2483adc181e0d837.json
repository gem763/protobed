It\u2019s perfect for a short break and ideal as a base for cruising.\n\nOn a Uniworld cruise you can have both pleasures: enjoy a short break in Bordeaux together with a jolly river adventure.\n\nWineland: To reach the Dordogne and Garonne rivers, cruise boats must squeeze underneath Bordeaux's Pont de Pierre\n\nCruising here looks away from the sea and concentrates on the two rivers that meet up near Bordeaux: the Dordogne and the Garonne. To reach these rivers, cruise boats have to squeeze themselves under the city\u2019s Pont de Pierre \u2013 one of the great spectacles of modern river cruising.\n\nActually, river-cruise ships can\u2019t journey far down either river, so on a seven-night cruise from Bordeaux you\u2019re never very far from the city.\n\nThe basis of a gentle holiday should be some relaxed pottering about. And this is exactly what you get.\n\nOur Uniworld vessel, SS Bon Voyage, ventured 30 miles up the Gironde to Blaye and Pauillac before returning towards Bordeaux and then heading up the Garonne to Cadillac and afterwards up the Dordogne to Libourne before finishing with two nights in Bordeaux.\n\nNoble rot: A visit to Chateau d'Yquem includes a tasting of Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Yquem vintage, considered the finest wine in the region\n\nTRAVEL FACTS Uniworld\u2019s eight-day Brilliant Bordeaux river cruise itinerary on board the SS Bon Voyage is priced from \u00a32,499 pp, twin share. Price includes seven nights in a river-view stateroom, all meals and unlimited beverages, flights and transfers, including excursions and gratuities. Visit uniworld.com.\n\nAlmost the first thing you are given on board is a wine map of Bordeaux. A journey here is like a voyage through a posh wine list: heading up the Gironde there are great names to the right and left. On the left bank, for example, look out for St-Estephe, Pauillac, M\u00e9doc and Margaux \u2013 over on the right bank you\u2019ll find of St-Georges and St-Emilion.\n\nEverything is included \u2013 food, alcoholic drinks (including, of course, excellent local wine with meals) but also gratuities and excursions. Every day there\u2019s an excellent outing, usually wine-related.\n\nBut not always. Our first tour, for example, was a Bunkers Archaeological Tour. A \u2018bonkers\u2019 tour or a \u2018bunkers\u2019 tour?\n\nActually it was a tour of the German Second World War bunkers built at Soulac-sur-Mer near the mouth of the Gironde.\n\nThese concrete fortifications were so well built that the German soldiers occupying them didn\u2019t surrender until April 19, 1945, a full ten months after D-Day and just a few weeks before the end of the war.\n\nOur next visit was to a privately owned castle \u2013 the Ch\u00e2teau de Cazeneuve, once the residence of King Henry IV and Queen Marguerite.\n\nEveryone\u2019s favourite excursion was to St-Emilion, a small town with a big reputation for fine wine.\n\nIt\u2019s a thriving hub, packed with wine shops and good restaurants, with plenty of interesting sights, including the Eglise Monolithe, an 11th Century church that is cut out of the limestone rock.\n\nBeneath it are historic catacombs \u2013 next door you can also visit the Ermitage Saint-Emilion, once the home of the eponymous saint.\n\nBordeaux, for the final two nights, provides the icing on the cake. One of the most handsome cities in France, its good looks relate directly to the wealth generated by the wine business.
