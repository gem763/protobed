General Assembly, Abbas also criticized the U.S. for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, for saying that Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories are legitimate and cutting development aid to the Palestinians.\n\nU.S. policy, he said, is \u201cpushing large segments of the Palestinian people to lose hope in the possibility of long-awaited peace,\u201d and renewed his call for an international peace conference.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it is working on a long-awaited peace plan, which the Palestinians have rejected over what they see as the administration\u2019s unfair bias toward Israel. The last round of direct peace negotiations broke down in 2009, shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assumed office. Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Israel Katz, was scheduled to address the General Assembly later Thursday.\n\nSee: Netanyahu given first crack at forming the next government in Israel\n\nAbbas opened his speech with a warning: \u201cOur people are waiting for hope. Be careful, be careful, be careful,\u201d Abbas said. \u201cYou should not ignore this generation and deprive them of this hope. I hope you do not deprive them of this hope.\u201d\n\nAbbas was not the only one seeking U.N. help to address conflicts with neighbors as leaders from nations struggling with war and poverty had their say before the world body.\n\nThe president of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, accused Turkey of undermining recent peace talks with its aggressive behavior. The two have been at odds since 1974, when Turkey invaded following a coup by supporters of union with Greece, splitting the country along ethnic lines.\n\nInequality within the United Nations also was a theme: Abbas urged the General Assembly to give the Palestinians, who in 2012 were granted the status of a U.N. observer state, full membership in the 193-nation world body.\n\nSeparately, Sierra Leone\u2019s president, Julius Maada Bio, called for the Security Council to give Africa a permanent seat on the Security Council, which is the U.N.\u2019s most powerful body.\n\nIt currently has 10 members elected for two-year terms and five permanent members \u2014 the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s patience has been tested,\u201d he said, noting an urgent need for the continent\u2019s representation.\n\nFor decades, there have been calls to expand the U.N.\u2019s most powerful body, but competing national and regional interests have prevented council reform so far.\n\nThe most off-beat argument for reform came from El Salvador\u2019s new leader, who opened his speech by taking a selfie and suggesting that the global gathering is out of touch with the times.\n\nPresident Nayib Bukele said the U.N. needs to embrace change and technology to stay relevant \u2014 and suggested the assembly could meet via video and engage people around the world in its work.\n\nLater Thursday, diplomats from Israel and Saudi Arabia, which blames Iran for a Sept. 14 attack on its key oil sites, were expected to push their causes.\n\nIran has denied any involvement in the Saudi strike, which jolted global oil prices and temporarily knocked out nearly 6% of daily global crude oil production.\n\nSaudi Arabia insists Iranian weapons were used and has invited U.N. investigators to assess where the strikes originated. The U.S., France, Britain and Germany have said Iran was behind the attacks.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani again denied any responsibility for the attacks in a news conference on Thursday.\n\nIsrael considers Iran to be its greatest enemy and has been a leading opponent to the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran. Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, says Tehran is trying to build a nuclear weapon \u2014 which Iran denies \u2014 and has accused the Iranians of violating provisions of the agreement.", "description": "\u2018Our people are waiting for hope,\u2019 Abbas tells the UN General Assembly. \u2018I hope you do not deprive them of this hope.\u2019", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS167_abbas__ZG_20190926172415.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
