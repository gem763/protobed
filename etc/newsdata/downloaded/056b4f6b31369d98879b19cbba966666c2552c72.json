And in a slap at the West, the ships will be built in a shipyard in the Crimea, forcibly annexed from Ukraine in 2014, which led to Western sanctions against Russia.\n\n\"Two amphibious assault ships, with water displacement of up to 15,000 tons, will for the first time in Russian history be laid down at the Zaliv shipyard in Kerch in 2020,\" one source said. The first vessel is slated to be delivered before Russia\u2019s current 10-year arms procurement plan ends at the end of 2027.\n\n\u201cThe ships will be able to carry over 10 helicopters of various types and will be equipped with a dock-type chamber for landing craft utilities (LTU),\u201d TASS said. How many troops will be carried wasn\u2019t specified, though TASS noted that such ships carry from a few hundred to more than a thousand soldiers.\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates eight Wasp-class amphibious assault ships, each about 41,000 tons. They carry almost 2,000 Marines, plus up to a dozen landing craft, 30 M-1 tanks and AAV7A1 amphibious armored vehicles, eight towed 155-millimeter howitzers, and almost a hundred trucks, Humvees and other support vehicles. That ground force is supported by a powerful mixed air unit comprising about 20 to 30 transport and attack helicopters, MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, AV-8B Harrier jets and F-35B short-takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) stealth fighters.\n\nThe Wasps give the United States the capability to land a Marine Expeditionary Unit (essentially a reinforced infantry battalion) by sea or air, backed by armor and air support. Deployed around the world as the centerpiece of Amphibious Ready Groups complete with escort warships, such groups have allowed America to land troops at global hotspots at short notice.\n\nBut the Russian vessels seem closer to France\u2019s Mistral-class amphibious assault ships. The 21,000-ton Mistrals accommodate up to 900 troops, 40 Leclerc tanks, 16 transport and attack helicopters, and a few amphibious landing vehicles. France operates three, while Egypt has two.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Vital for power projection.", "authors": ["Michael Peck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GEu2qHXvVGTIGHKZ3uCRMA--~B/aD04NzA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/8c0db1101d0ce6193360e77692b3e597", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
