They have planned an itinerary of workshops and events for campers and visitors.\n\nEarly on Saturday morning, protesters from XR\u2019s Animal Rebellion chapter sat down to block the entrance to Billingsgate, the UK\u2019s largest inland fish market, while one demonstrator locked herself to the entrance, a statement from the group said.\n\nAbout 200 protesters who had gathered in Canary Wharf began their protest at about 3.30am, the group said in a statement circulated to the media.\n\nPolice initially tried to prevent them from reaching the market but relented after negotiations, the group said. Billingsgate management refused a request to enter into a dialogue, according to protesters.\n\nThe Metropolitan police said there had been 1,290 arrests in connection with Extinction Rebellion protests as of 9.30am on Saturday. The Met did not respond to a request for comment on the demonstration.\n\nKerri Waters, a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion, said: \u201cTo many, eating fish is seen as the healthy choice. But just as land animals suffer, so do fish, who think, make friends and feel pain. But their suffering goes unnoticed.\n\n\u201cAt London\u2019s Billingsgate Market, thousands of fish, stolen daily from their ocean homes, lie dead or dying. Many will have suffocated slowly when pulled aboard fishing vessels, whilst thousands of others remain alive as they\u2019re transported by lorry to the market, where they\u2019ll be gutted or boiled alive.\u201d\n\nAnother spokesperson for the group, Alex Lockwood, said: \u201cIt was our duty to come here and make these demands that we must transition to a sustainable food system and stop exploiting the millions of fish that pass through this market every year.\u201d", "description": "Activists say 28 people were arrested after trying to block access to London fish market", "authors": ["Damien Gayle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7e41e16ab7b5945a564911835f271725ad29549/0_182_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c7c022e59912ac5ca374771b4638a11e", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
