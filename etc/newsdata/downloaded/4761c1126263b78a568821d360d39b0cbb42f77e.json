Lego saw \u201cstrong double-digit growth\u201d in China and will open an office in Dubai this year. \u201cIn places like China and India as we expand our geographic reach, people actually don\u2019t know Lego at all, so we still can learn what it means and build up that muscle to be a challenger brand and to learn what it means to have competition and fight copycat \u2026 It\u2019s a matter of staying humble,\u201d Kim said, speaking at Advertising Week Europe. Lego announced a partnership with Tencent in January, which will see Lego games offered by the Chinese internet giant, as well as an extension of Lego Life in China.\n\nNewer entrants are also coming into the market all the time, such as GoldieBlox, a toy company encouraging girls to build and aiming to inspire careers in the science and technology industries. \u201cIt would be easy to be arrogant and just say that everyone knows the brand, and we just keep doing what we\u2019re doing and we\u2019re good, but it\u2019s always, hey, what do consumers want, how do we get there, how do we deliver?\u201d Kim said.\n\nFinding out what children and their parents want is the secret to Lego\u2019s success. According to Goldin, the answer is novelty: each year, 25 percent to 30 percent of sales come from new products. \u201cAs a chief marketing officer you really need to understand how the whole process works, how you can accelerate it, how you can bring things to market faster, how you problem solve around it, but also how you inspire innovation,\u201d Goldin told CNBC. And it is here that her experience selling cosmetics to women at Revlon helps her.\n\n\u201cLike in the toy business, the beauty category depends a lot on novelty \u2026 Like kids, women don\u2019t know what they want \u2026 No woman would ever tell you what it is that she really wants. No woman would ever tell you that she has enough pairs of shoes or enough colors of lipsticks or enough makeup. But if you ask them what is it that you want, they will never know. And it's the same with the kids, they're looking for novelty.\u201d", "description": "The humble Lego brick is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year.
