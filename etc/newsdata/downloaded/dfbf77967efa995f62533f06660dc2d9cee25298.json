The facial recognition bill explained", "language": "en", "text": "Though both the Identity-matching Services Bill and the Passports Amendment Bill were reintroduced in July by the Immigration Minister, the bulk of their powers would have accrued to the Department of Home Affairs.\n\nThe laws authorise Home Affairs to maintain centralised databases of facial images from government-issued documents (for example, passports and driver's licences) and other identity markers such as address and birthplace. These facilities are known as the \"interoperability hub\" and the \"National Driver Licence Facial Recognition Solution\".\n\nThe department may then use and transmit this information to perform a range of \"identity-matching services\" for other government agencies and non-government contractors.\n\nThe most general of these functions is identifying an unknown person by cross-referencing their image (say, from a CCTV screenshot) against the pictures in the database. But there are also more specialised services such as facial recognition to detect whether a person has multiple driver's licences.\n\nAccordingly, the scope of activities for which the department can authorise the use of identity-matching services is expansive. Besides national security and law enforcement, it encompasses \"community safety\" and \"road safety\" activities, as well as the puzzling category of \"verifying identity\".\n\nWhy did the PJCIS reject it?\n\nIn a surprise move, the bipartisan parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security knocked back the facial recognition bills last week, recommending that the laws be redrafted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe PJCIS said the bills were inconsistent with a set of principles including \"privacy and transparency\", and agreed with four key criticisms of the laws.\n\nFirst, the committee said it \"had not been persuaded\" that it would be inappropriate to require enforcement agencies to obtain a warrant before accessing certain facial recognition services.\n\nHome Affairs said a warrant system would have a \"significant impact\" on the ability of authorities to use the service by impeding operational activity and diverting resources from investigations.\n\nThe PJCIS questioned the strength of these arguments but did not dismiss them altogether, requesting \"further advice and briefings from relevant enforcement and security agencies\".\n\nSecond, the committee found that the laws allowed the home affairs minister to indefinitely expand the number of biometric markers included in the database, and felt this was not appropriate.\n\nThough the data used for identity-matching is initially restricted to information available on government-issued documents, the bill allows the minister to add \"any information that is prescribed by the rules\" without the need for primary legislation.\n\nThe Law Council of Australia said this may lead to the expansion of the databases to encompass a \"larger, more intrusive set of data sources\", such as charge photos and prison photos. The PJCIS cited \"iris scanning\", which is already used in smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy, as a biometric marker that a future minister may choose to include.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThird, and still on the theme of excessive discretion, the committee concluded that the legislation allowed Home Affairs to indefinitely add to its list of identity-matching services.\n\nHere, the concern is that facial recognition will expand beyond \"one-to-one\" or \"one-to-many\" systems, which compare a single nominated person against one or several faces in the database, to \"many-to-one\" or \"many-to-many\" models, which scan for multiple people (say, in a crowd) at once.\n\nThe PJCIS accepted that this was not the intention of the government, but that the bills nonetheless \"could theoretically empower the Minister to allow for this\".\n\nFourth, the committee recommended that the bill be changed to ensure that automated decision-making can only be used for decisions that \"produce favourable or neutral outcomes for the subject\".\n\nThe Passport Amendment Bill authorises the use of \"computer programs\" to automate the sharing of passport-related information under the act.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which has primary responsibility for passports, acknowledged the possibility of \"incorrect automated decisions\". But it said automation would not be used to make decisions that have a \"negative impact\" on the individuals concerned.\n\nThe PJCIS concluded that this was not adequately reflected in the bill.\n\nHow will the bills likely (not) change?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHome Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has vowed to bring back a revised version of the facial recognition laws, saying that the rejected bills \"will become legislation\".\n\nThe PJCIS has said \"the Bill would need a significant amount of redrafting and not simple amending\" to win its support. But its report nonetheless sided with the government, and against the concerns of civil society groups, on three key points that are likely to remain a feature of the revised bill.\n\nFirst, the bipartisan committee mostly elided over the concerns that the scope of activities that justify facial recognition services is too broad.\n\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission said that the use of identity-matching technology for \"road safety activities\" and \"verifying identity\" should be disallowed.\n\nBut the PJCIS said road safety activities qualified only for specific services involving facial recognition such as the \"one person, one licence\" test, and cited a submission from the Victorian government that supported their inclusion in the scope of use.\n\nSecond, the committee did not make a recommendation in response to the concerns of civil society that facial recognition technology carries a \"bias towards the dominant ethnic group in the area in which it is developed\".\n\nAside from inbuilt biases in the technology, the act excludes ascriptive characteristics such as ethnicity or religious affiliation from the \"identification information\" held in databases. But it acknowledges that these may be inferred from a person's name or place of birth.\n\nThe PJCIS said it was \"interested in the accuracy of the technology\" and that Home Affairs had declined to identify the makers of the software, citing risks of external attack. But it ultimately noted that there the act would be reviewed within five years of its commencement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThird, the PJCIS seemed to weigh against the appointment of a new \"biometrics commissioner\" to oversee the retention, collection and use of biometric information.\n\nThe Law Council of Australia was among the civil society groups that cited Britain's biometrics commissioner, a position established in 2012, as a model.\n\nWhile noting that the oversight mechanism should be the subject of consultation, the PJCIS said that an expansion in the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner's remit may be one option.\n\nThe bipartisan committee's report included a final barb against the government.\n\n\"A citizen should be able to read a piece of legislation and know what that legislation authorises and what rights and responsibilities the citizen has in relation to that legislation,\" the committee said.\n\n\"It is clear that the Identity-matching Service Bill does not inform the citizen reader in this way.\"", "description": "Home Affairs says the measures are a necessary protection and not \"mass surveillance\".
