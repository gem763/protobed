Love U.K.\" (punctuation very much the president's own).\n\nCorbyn has called on opposition party leaders and MPs to support a Labour-led vote of no confidence in Johnson's government, in a bid to force him from office and stop a no-deal Brexit.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump backed another of his European friends, Giuseppe Conte, saying: \"Starting to look good for the highly respected Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, Giuseppe Conte. Represented Italy powerfully at the G-7. Loves his Country greatly & works well with the USA. A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister!\"\n\nIn an earlier version of that tweet, Trump called him \"Giuseppi\" Conte.\n\nWould be very hard for Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain\u2019s Labour Party, to seek a no-confidence vote against New Prime Minister Boris Johnson, especially in light of the fact that Boris is exactly what the U.K. has been looking for, & will prove to be \u201ca great one!\u201d Love U.K. \u2014 Donald J.
