It was paradise. We lived surrounded by beauty and lots of friends and no parents.\"\n\nIt was also a life lived in the outdoors with plenty of swimming and hiking to keep her healthy, she says.\n\nAlthough she was educated in St Andrews, she returned to Borneo until she was 17 when her parents moved back to Scotland.\n\nImage copyright Gillean mcleod Image caption Gillean says she always felt tall and gawky as a child\n\nGillean says that when she was young she did not ever consider herself beautiful.\n\n\"I was so skinny. I was always thought of myself as tall and gawky,\" she says.\n\n\"Then by the time I reached an adolescent and was at school in Scotland I had terrible acne for most of my teen years. So that resulted in crippling shyness and being very self-conscious about that.\"\n\nIn her 20s, Gillean moved to London and, although she says she was approached about modelling, her teenage acne had affected her self-esteem and she always said no.\n\nHaving lived in Los Angeles for decades, Gillian was finally persuaded to have some professional photos taken.\n\n\"I wasn't really convinced because I had always been really shy, especially putting my face in front of a camera,\" she says. \"But I did it.\"\n\nShe says: \"I had couple of jobs until I was about 60 and then I did a story in a bathing suit that went viral.\"\n\nGillean now has a flourishing career, recently working in Germany, New York and Los Angeles.\n\nHer campaign for Oliver People's resulted in a massive billboard in New York's Times Square, which Gillean flew out to see.\n\nImage copyright Gillean McLeod Image caption Gillean in Times Square with her billboard in the background\n\nGillean warns young girls looking at Instagram and magazine images that they are not real life.\n\nShe says they are shot by professionals who use the best lighting and the images are almost always retouched afterwards.\n\n\"You have to believe in yourself and eating healthy really helps a lot too,\" she says.\n\nAccording to Gillean, there are now more older women being used a models.\n\n\"I don't think I started it but that H&M campaign made more people aware of how women can look in their 50s and 60s,\" she says.\n\n\"I am with an agency in New York where almost everybody is over 60 and they are gorgeous.\"", "description": "Gillean McLeod only had her first professional photos taken when she was in her early 50s.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nw1h1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
