The new OS adds better multitasking features, a desktop-class Safari experience, and it even adds support for connecting a mouse to the tablet. New features showcased on Sept. 10 also include a redesigned home screen, which shows more apps on each page, as well as a new video editing experience and new ways to use the Apple Pencil.\n\nFor the very first time, the entry-level iPad features the smart connector so that users can connect the optional full-size Smart Keyboard. The seventh-generation iPad also features 3.5 million pixels -- more than three times the number of pixels than the top-selling PC laptop in the US for the first half of this year, Apple says. It also offers greater brightness and a wider viewing angle. Apple also claims this iPad, featuring the A10 Fusion chip, is up to 2X faster than that top-selling PC.\n\nThe new device weighs just about a pound, and its enclosure is made from 100 percent recyclable aluminum.\n\nThe entry-level, 9.7-inch iPad brings more new users to iPad than any other model, according to Apple. For nearly 60% of users, this is their first iPad.\n\nMust read\n\nThe iPad has been a strong performer for Apple, bringing in more than $5 billion in revenue in the last reported quarter. Customers have had as many as 68 iPad options to choose from, with five models and a variety of finish, storage capacity, and LTE or wi-fi options.\n\nDisclosure: ZDNet may earn a commission from some of the products featured on this page.", "description": "The new entry-level tablet, which starts at just $329, was engineered to take full advantage of iPadOS.", "authors": ["Stephanie Condon"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/10/cb2e3b8a-2e37-455d-a869-efc97c2380c9/thumbnail/770x578/90dc335a10c6a26d36991d0b39c5cbca/apple-new-ipad-new-seventh-generation-091019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
