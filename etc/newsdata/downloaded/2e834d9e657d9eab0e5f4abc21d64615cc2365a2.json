And everybody wants light and love!\"\n\n\"Love is the most important thing in music and you always want to transport this feeling and comfort people with sound, and words, and poetry, and maybe there Nasimi\u2019s poetry and the music meets today,\" says soprano, Margriet Buchberger.\n\nBMC Zaur_M\n\nThe Nasimi Festival runs from the 28 September to 1 October 2019, in Baku.", "description": "Kicking off in Baku,  the multi-disciplinary festival bears the name of Imadeddin Nasimi a great 14 century poet and thinkers.", "authors": ["Katy Dartford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/29/76/1000x563_cmsv2_de1ced1f-b5c8-59c1-a532-30cad2f5f2ad-4202976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
