In fortunes backed by decades of accumulated assets and dividends, the true extent of an individual's or family's holdings is often obscured. Most in this tax bracket are not thrilled to have their names, assets, shares, and interests published by a global news organisation. Automotive wealth also tends to be a family affair. While individual members of these dynasties may not make the list, a clan's overall wealth may be vast. (See: the Ford, Porsche, and Pieech families.) So we followed the same criteria applied to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index.\n\nTo keep it (relatively) simple, we have omitted those whose wealth comes from oil. Take the House of Saud, for instance. The family is worth an estimated $US100 billion, a figure based on the cumulative payouts the country's royals have received over the past five decades from the executive office of the king. That number doesn't even include the planned initial public offering of its crown jewel, oil giant Saudi Aramco. It will be offered with an anticipated valuation of $US2 trillion.\n\nMaybe we'll come up with a special list for members of the House of Saud. In the meantime, here are the year's richest people in cars. Stake value and per cent of net worth figures are as of July 19, 2019. Total wealth figures are as of October 9, 2019.\n\n1.

Larry Ellison\n\nCompany: Tesla\n\nStake Value: $US730,773,000 to $US1 billion\n\nPer cent of Total Net Worth: 1.3 per cent\n\nTotal Wealth: $US58.5 billion\n\nLocation: Palo Alto, California.\n\nSegment: Passenger vehicles\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough he is the company's second-largest shareholder, Ellison's recently announced stake in Tesla is not the primary source of his wealth.
