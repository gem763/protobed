A New Power Deal for UK Steel.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIt says: \u201cThe UK\u2019s energy intensive industries face some of the highest industrial electricity prices in Europe.\n\n\u201cThis damages the steel sector\u2019s competitiveness as it is both electro-intensive and highly exposed to international competition, meaning it cannot pass on additional costs to customers.\n\n\u201cWith steel producers\u2019 direct competitiveness and levels of investment both being affected, electricity prices have become a major ongoing concern for the sector and its long-term sustainability.\u201d\n\nDespite wholesale prices dropping over the past year, there remains a \u201cpersistent gap between UK industrial power prices and those elsewhere\u201d, with German and French steelmakers paying \u00a319 per megawatt-hour and \u00a322/MWh less respectively than those in the UK.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBritish steel firms pay \u00a350/MWh, compared with \u00a331/MWh in Germany and just \u00a328/MWh in France.\n\nA typical steel plant could use more than half a million MWh each year.\n\nFor some steel companies, electricity represents the largest cost after raw materials - including workers\u2019 pay.\n\nExperts warn that higher prices mean there is less cash to pump into new equipment and technology.\n\nThe burden also puts off potential investors, \u201cseverely reducing the sector\u2019s ability to be competitive today and through to the long term\u201d.\n\nUK Steel added: \u201cThis ultimately erodes the sector\u2019s future in the UK.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe report says: \u201cUK prices for extra-large industrial users currently stand 56% above the EU average.\n\n\u201cThis fact is consistently cited by all UK steel producers as harmful to their competitiveness and an impediment to investment.\u201d\n\nNearly 32,000 people are directly employed in Britain\u2019s steel industry, which contributes \u00a31.6billion to the economy.\n\nUK Steel director general Gareth Stace said: \u201cOur new report plainly demonstrates that UK steelmakers face systemically and persistently higher electricity prices than our competitors.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cElectricity is one of the biggest costs for the steel industry and it damages our competitiveness that we are consistently forced to pay significantly more.\n\n\u201cThe Government must act now to provide that level playing field the sector desperately needs.\u201d\n\nCommunity steelworkers union operations' director Alasdair McDiarmid said: \"It's disappointing we're still talking about this difference in energy costs because we've been calling for action for years.\n\n\u201cOur steel industry is continuing to compete with one hand tied behind its back.\n\n\u201cGiven all the pressures facing the industry it's high-time the government got real about the steps that must be taken to put UK steel companies on a level playing field with their competitors.\"\n\nThe Mirror has been calling for an energy price cut for steel firms as part of our Save Our Steel campaign, launched in 2015 as the industry was battered by job losses and factory closures.\n\nLast month, the sector suffered a fresh blow as it was announced the Orb Electrical Steels plant in Newport, South Wales, will close after 121 years of steelmaking, along with a service centre in Wolverhampton.\n\n(Image: Scunthorpe Live)\n\nSome 400 jobs were plunged into jeopardy.\n\nScunthorpe-based British Steel went into liquidation in May but talks continue over a rescue deal which could save more than 4,000 jobs.\n\nLabour MP Stephen Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency includes Britain's biggest steelworks, Port Talbot, said: \u201cBritish steelworkers make the best steel in the world but they\u2019re made to do so with one hand tied behind their backs due to the grossly uncompetitive electricity prices that our steel companies are forced to pay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an outrage that ministers claim to be standing up for steel whilst doing absolutely nothing about the fact that British steelmakers are paying 80% more for electricity than their French counterparts, and 62% more than the Germans.\n\n\u201cIf it were to level the playing field on these costs the Government would, at the stroke of a pen, be enabling the release of an additional \u00a347million of desperately-needed investment into our steel industry.\u201d", "description": "The trade body called for prices to be slashed so UK companies can become more competitive", "authors": ["Ben Glaze", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Scunthorpe Live"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16175391.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILES-BRITAIN-POLITICS-STEEL-BRITISHSTEEL.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
