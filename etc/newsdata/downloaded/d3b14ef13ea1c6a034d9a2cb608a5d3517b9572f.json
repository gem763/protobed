What do the last 24 hours tell us about the chances of a deal actually being done?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Johnson: EU have had \"bellyful\" of delays\n\nPodiumgate tells us that both sides find it hard to present a joint front, and perhaps the relations of Brexit are so fractured that political leaders are not willing to observe the normal rules of diplomatic engagement.\n\nAnd if, in the months to come, either side is looking to apportion blame, Monday's events could play equally strongly into both sides' hands.\n\nMore pertinently maybe, when we asked the prime minister how he actually intended to get a deal, he suggested that there was space to revise the arrangements around the controversial backstop but simply wouldn't elaborate on what those details might be.\n\nAnd when we asked, repeatedly, exactly how he intends to get round Parliament's decision to try to outlaw leaving without a deal he just would not say.\n\nRight now it seems the volume is rising, but the clock is still ticking down.", "description": "\"Podiumgate\" in Luxembourg was a pantomime distraction to the developments in the bigger Brexit story.", "authors": ["Laura Kuenssberg", "Political Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nj0lw.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
