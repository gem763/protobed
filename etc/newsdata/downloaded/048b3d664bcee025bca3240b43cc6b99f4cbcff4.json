Citibank violated rules that set a maximum limit on how long banks are allowed to own a property.\n\nThe bank doesn\u2019t admit or deny wrongdoing, the OCC said in its order. The regulator said the bank has paid the fine. \u201cSince identifying the issue, we have strengthened controls, processes and procedures to ensure the timely disposition of these assets,\u201d a bank spokesman said in an emailed statement. Citibank lacked the necessary policies and procedures to monitor its compliance with rules that govern how long banks can hold on to the property, according to the OCC order. The OCC\u2019s consent order states that the bank violated the holding period more than 200 times over a two-year period that ended this past August. The bank, since 2015, has committed multiple times to fix its deficiencies, the OCC said. The OCC continues to monitor the bank\u2019s efforts to strengthen its internal controls, it said. \u2014Kristin Broughton contributed to this article.
