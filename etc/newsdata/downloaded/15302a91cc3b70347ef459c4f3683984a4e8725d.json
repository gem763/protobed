But it is on the anniversary of his death that she is most drawn to the site where two 110-story towers stood until Sept. 11, 2001.\n\n\u201cEvery year I feel compelled to come,\u201d she said Wednesday in lower Manhattan on the 18th anniversary of the worst terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Joel Miller and nearly 3,000 others died at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and in a field near Shanksville, Pa., when terrorists commandeered four jetliners and turned them into weapons.\n\nMr. Miller\u2019s remains, like those of many victims, were never recovered.\n\n\u201cIn many ways this is our cemetery,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cTo me, this is his place, and this is my place. He breathed here, he died here. This is where I feel him.\u201d\n\nMs. Miller and thousands of others attended a ceremony at the Ground Zero memorial site that began just before 9 a.m., with moments of silence and the ringing of bells to mark when planes hit the World Trade Center and when the twin towers fell. Mr. Miller had been at work at Marsh & McLennan on the 94th floor when the first plane hit his tower.\n\nAs with previous anniversaries at the 9/11 Memorial, the names of the nearly 3,000 victims killed in the attacks were read by family and friends.\n\nCeremonies were held in New York City and Washington, D.C., to commemorate the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Mr. Trump later headed to the Pentagon, where he recalled the day 18 years ago, describing the attack as \u201cseared into our soul.\u201d He praised first responders, offered support to families who lost loved ones and promised to respond to any future threats with military might.\n\nNation Marks 18th Anniversary of 9/11 U.S. honors those lost in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 Visitors take a moment during the reading of victims\u2019 names Wednesday at the National September 11 Memorial during ceremonies marking the 18th anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks.

The president said he would posthumously award the Presidential Citizens Medal to Mr. Rescorla, who as first vice president of security at Morgan Stanley on 9/11 helped thousands of fellow workers escape.\n\nFor many of the loved ones of the victims, time hasn\u2019t eased their pain.\n\nLa-Shawn Clark was one of the dozens of relatives who took part in reading the victims\u2019 names on Wednesday at the ceremony in lower Manhattan. Her husband of 15 years, Benjamin Keefe Clark, was a chef for Fiduciary Trust and died trying to get people out of one of the towers when it collapsed.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you commemorate 9/11, the people we lost and those who helped rebuild?
