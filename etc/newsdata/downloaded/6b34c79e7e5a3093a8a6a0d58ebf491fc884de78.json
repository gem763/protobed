The level of your offending is increasing and not diminishing.\u201d\n\nHe told the defendant he will serve at least two-thirds of the 12-year sentence - and be required to spend an extended five-year period on licence following his eventual release.\n\nIn a statement read to the court, PC Phillips told how he blacked out and regained consciousness in the road feeling \u201cpain I can\u2019t describe \u2026 pain I had never felt before\u201d.\n\nHe said he spent two weeks in intensive care and was told by doctors that the first operation had saved his life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say what my long-term prognosis will be and I\u2019m certainly facing more surgery in the weeks and months to come,\u201d PC Phillips said.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear if I will ever be able to return to work - but being a police officer is a job that I love. It is something I have done for almost the two decades, and will do everything I can to get back into policing.\u201d\n\nWhen being interviewed by police, Hussain apologised and claimed to \u201cfeel bad\u201c for what he\u2019d done, suggesting it was \u201cmadness\u201d and that he had panicked.\n\nHe was initially charged with attempted murder but later admitted an alternative charge of wounding with intent to resist arrest at Birmingham Crown Court.\n\nHussain also admitted 11 other offences including causing grievous bodily harm, two counts of vehicle theft, dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, assaults against three other officers, aggravated vehicle-taking and two charges of having no insurance.\n\nHe has four previous convictions for dangerous driving and has also been jailed for car theft and conspiring to steal motor vehicles.\n\nGhafoor, of Fulham Road in Sparkhill, was jailed for 28 months after admitting two counts of car theft and three other offences.\n\nThe 24-year-old also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, having no insurance and driving other than in accordance with a licence.\n\nSupt Dave Twyford, the head of West Midlands Police\u2019s traffic unit, said PC Phillips had been working a normal day hunting car thieves and trying to protect the public.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard people say many times how he lives for the job and is a copper through and through,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhat happened on the afternoon of 10 August was nothing short of horrific. Gaz suffered awful injuries. He could have died.\u201d\n\nSupt Twyford said the attack had a \u201chuge emotional impact\u201d on the officers who witnessed it and their colleagues, and that psychological help was being offered.\n\n\u201cDespite the awful impact the incident had on our staff I\u2019m proud to say they remained stoic in the face of adversity and worked together to ensure a comprehensive investigation was carried out,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cHussain has rightly been put behind bars for many years for this deliberate act of grotesque violence against a man whose job it is to protect the public.\u201d\n\nChief constable Dave Thompson said it was never acceptable for people to consider attacks on officers as simply \u201cpart of the job\u201d, amid rising assaults.\n\nHe said there were an average of 25 assaults on West Midlands Police officers every weeks, adding: \u201cThe nature of policing requires officers to handle difficult, sometimes hostile situations, but assaults upon them are serious and unacceptable.\u201d\n\n", "description": "A man has been jailed for 12 years for running over a police officer in a hijacked police car before speeding through Birmingham at 97mph.
