At a Tuesday event for investors, Victoria\u2019s Secret Chief Executive Officer John Mehas offered up his vision for a revival. Unfortunately, it was frustratingly vague \u2014 making it difficult to say whether things will turn positive anytime soon for Victoria\u2019s Secret.\n\nAdvertising is one of the areas where Victoria\u2019s Secret most acutely needs an overhaul, and the recent departure of longtime marketing chief Ed Razek provided a glimmer of hope that change was imminent. The brand needs to be seen as \u201cby her, for her,\u201d said Mehas, without providing too many specifics. (There was also a certain irony in the fact that, as my colleague Jordyn Holman noted, the company trumpeted this notion during an event in which most of the speakers were men.)\n\nIf the new mantra indicates an intention to deliver a more empowering message, then it\u2019s an encouraging sign. Again, however, details were lacking. Would the company replace its splashy holiday fashion show, which it has said it is rethinking? Mehas didn\u2019t say.\n\nHe did show a video presentation of Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s new collaboration with the brand For Love & Lemons. It featured racially diverse models that didn\u2019t necessarily have the Barbie-doll bodies of past Victoria\u2019s Secret campaigns, suggesting a fresh and much-needed focus on inclusivity. Yet the product in the ad was more frivolous than functional.\n\nMehas also talked about needing to get back to an emphasis on bras, innovating in this core product area to win women back. That is surely the right idea, though there was no single forthcoming product described that sounds like it could truly separate it from the competition.\n\nMeanwhile, Victoria\u2019s Secret has been working to change its pricing strategy to offer a mix of \u201cgood, better, best\u201d items that it hopes will nudge shoppers toward paying more premium prices. It is a sensible choice, as it would make Victoria\u2019s Secret more distinctive from its sister chain, Pink, and could help pad profit margins.\n\nThe problem is that the lingerie chain has leaned so heavily on discounts for so long that it is going to have a hard time training shoppers to pay up. Executives didn\u2019t have a particularly satisfying explanation for how they will manage to do that.\n\nDespite all this vague talk of what\u2019s to come at Victoria\u2019s Secret, investors sent shares of L Brands up more than 3% on Tuesday. This probably reflects faith in the company\u2019s Bath & Body Works chain, which looks poised to continue a streak of solid performance, as well as optimism about Pink, its lingerie and apparel store aimed at the college set. Pink\u2019s new leader, Amy Hauk, outlined her vision for restoring that chain with a focus on athletic wear \u2014 a tack away from big logos and bling \u2014 and a marketing campaign featuring college students with \u201creal bodies.\u201d\n\nThose chains, though, can only take the company so far. Victoria\u2019s Secret needs to start pulling its weight. It\u2019s just not clear that it is changing quickly enough to do so.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Sarah Halzack at shalzack@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Newman at mnewman43@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nSarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.
