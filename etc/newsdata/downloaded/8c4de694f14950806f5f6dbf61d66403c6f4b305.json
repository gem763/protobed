Gov. Wilder says he\u2019s been cleared of claims that he kissed 20-year-old but university says matter is unresolved", "language": "en", "text": "Wilder, 88, had appealed the original finding over the summer after a VCU investigation led by an outside attorney concluded he kissed the young woman without her consent.\n\nAD\n\nThe initial investigation had cleared Wilder of three other charges \u2014 sexual exploitation, gender-based discrimination and retaliation \u2014 but found him responsible for the fourth. The former governor, who is on the faculty at the Richmond-based university, said in July that he would challenge the finding before a four-member internal review panel.\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking Thursday at a news conference at VCU\u2019s L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs, Wilder said he had been cleared after a six-hour hearing last week.\n\n\u201cI am pleased that panel members confirmed what I have stated from the very beginning,\u201d he said.\n\nA lawyer for Sydney Black, who filed the complaint, said his client is waiting to see how the university resolves the matter before deciding her next step.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very upset, very disappointed,\u201d lawyer Jason V. Wolfrey said, but he cautioned that Wilder is not exonerated.\n\n\u201cThey found him not responsible for the unwanted sexual contact, but they didn\u2019t clear him,\u201d Wolfrey said. \u201cIn fact they made certain findings of fact . . . that they characterized as \u2018deeply concerning\u2019 and passed that information on to the powers that be at VCU.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWolfrey attended last week\u2019s hearing along with Black. They sat in a separate room from Wilder and communicated with the review panel by video. He said several facts of the case were accepted as \u201cundisputed\u201d and that the panel termed them \u201cdeeply disturbing conduct.\u201d\n\nVCU declined any further comment about the process, which it said is private.\n\nAD\n\nBlack, now 22, has said Wilder kissed her and made other overtures, including suggestions that she could live at his country house and accompany him on foreign travel. He also offered to pay for law school, she said.\n\nIn sharing her story with The Washington Post, Black said Wilder had taken an interest in her education after she was hired as an office assistant at the Wilder School in 2015. She said she was flattered by the attention from someone she admired, the nation\u2019s first elected African American governor.\n\nAD\n\nShe said she accepted his invitation to dinner in a Richmond restaurant to celebrate her 20th birthday. During dinner, she said, he ordered her vodka martinis and told her he could help her get accepted at the Howard University School of Law, where he is a board member.\n\nAD\n\nAfter dinner, Wilder, who is divorced, drove her to his nearby condo, Black said. As they talked, she said, \u201che reached over and put his hand on my right leg, and I just kind of looked at him, and as soon as I looked at him, he kissed me on my mouth. I immediately jerked away.\u201d\n\nWeeks later, he invited her to brunch at his country house, where he showed her a room where he said she could live rent-free, she said. Black said she declined Wilder\u2019s offers and told him she was looking for mentorship, not a personal relationship.\n\nThey had little contact until May 2017, when Wilder informed her there was no longer funding for her position at VCU, she said. Black said she waited nearly two years to report the incidents because she felt intimidated.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolice produced a two-page police incident report, dated Jan. 3, 2019, that says a 20-year-old woman reported that an assault had occurred Feb. 16, 2017, in a residence in the same block where Wilder owns a condo. No charges were filed.\n\nVCU then began an investigation under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program. While the investigation was pending, the university renewed Wilder\u2019s contract. He draws a $150,000 annual salary to teach courses at the school named for him.\n\nWolfrey, Black\u2019s lawyer, said the dinner, drinks and time alone at Wilder\u2019s home were not disputed in the review panel case.\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday, Wilder denied having any role in Black\u2019s job at the Wilder School and said her claims that he had harassed her by phone and eliminated her position after she rejected his advances were untrue.\n\nAD\n\nHe said he would continue teaching and acknowledged his reputation might have suffered.\n\n\u201cThe attention tarnishes my legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cSure, it\u2019s there. But it\u2019s like a coat of paint \u2014 it goes away.\u201d\n\nWolfrey said the matter will not go away just yet. Black, he said, is \u201cwaiting to see what VCU does\u201d with the report before deciding next steps. \u201cIn light of the undisputed findings about the contact between the two of them, the question is: What would VCU do if this was any other professor?\u201d\n\nJenna Portnoy contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "L.
