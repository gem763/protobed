People who own a Portal and use Workplace in the office will be able to combine the two to make video calls to colleagues.\n\n\"Even with the first generation of the device, we started seeing a lot of people asking to be able to call in to work calls,\" Karandeep Anand, Facebook's head of Workplace, told CNBC.\n\nThe videoconferencing space has received a healthy amount of attention this year, following Zoom's IPO, which rocketed the company up to a $21 billion market cap. Global Market Insights expects the market to reach $20 billion in revenue by 2024.\n\nWhile Zoom, in its IPO prospectus, highlighted competition from Cisco, Microsoft, Citrix and Google, it said that \"other large established companies like Amazon and Facebook have in the past and may in the future also make investments in video communications tools.\" Workplace already allows for video chat within the app on a smartphone or computer.\n\nIf you haven't previously heard of Workplace or Portal, you aren't alone. The two products are among the newer pieces of Facebook's portfolio. They're part of the payments and other fees business segment, which accounted for less than 2% of total revenue in the latest quarter.", "description": "Facebook said that its Workplace service for businesses will now work on Portal video chat devices.", "authors": ["Salvador Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105974278-1560857198722gettyimages-1146088646.jpeg?v=1562202866", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
