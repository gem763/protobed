( CVS last week, but with Deutsche Bank recommending it today as its top pick we will visit it again this Thursday morning as it's the Real Money 'Stock of the Day'.\n\nLast week we said, \"CVS is pointed up but there is a band of resistance around $66 that could get in the way of reaching the Point and Figure target of $73.\" Let's see if anything has changed.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of CVS, below, we can see that prices have crept higher the past week and trading volume looks like it has increased. Technical analysts love to see a stock increase on better volume. The 50-day moving average line is still pointed up and getting closer towards a probable cross of the 200-day line leading to a golden cross buy signal.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has remained steady and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has moved to a new outright buy signal.\n\nIn this updated weekly bar chart of CVS, below, we can see that our favorite indicators have continued to move in the right direction. Prices are above the bottoming 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is pointed up and the MACD oscillator is close to crossing above the zero line for a buy signal on this longer time frame.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of CVS, below, we can see one more new high at $63.50 when compared to last week. Our target of $73 is unchanged.\n\nBottom line strategy: CVS continues to move in the right direction for the bulls. Right below $58 on new or increased long positions.", "description": "CVS continues to move in the right direction for the bulls....CVS", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Cvs Health Continues To Move Higher - New Stop Recommendation", "Cvs Continues To Move In The Right Direction For The Bulls.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Guy Ortmann", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/539059b6-6c16-11e9-a10a-8f1df5237de4.jpg"}
