In a paper published in the journal Austrobaileya, botanist Dr Russell Barrett from the Sydney Royal Botanic Gardens describes the dog\u2019s balls shrubs as a unique species, with the newly christened scientific name Grewia savannicola.\n\nThe plant, known variously as (get ready for this) \u201c\u2018dog\u2019s balls\u2019, \u2019emu berry\u2019, \u2018dogs nuts\u2019, \u2018dysentery bush\u2019, \u2018dysentery plant\u2019 or \u2018turkey bush'\u201d, was previously considered to be a member of another species from south-east Asia, Grewia retusifolia.\n\nIn the paper, Grewia savannicola is described as \u201ca small, lignotuberous shrub, usually <0.8 m high\u201d with \u201cbisexual flowers with 10\u201315 stamens\u201c. Please, contain your arousal.\n\nFrom looking at an image of the plant, it seems pretty self-evident why it would have picked up the \u2018dog\u2019s balls\u2019 name, but in case you need it spelled out, here\u2019s Barrett talking to the ABC:\n\nMost people ask why is it called dog\u2019s balls until you show them a picture of the fruit. Then the penny drops. It\u2019s because the fruit generally has two seeds that are fused together side by side, covered in soft hairs, that hang down on a short stalk.\n\nNever has the phrase \u201csoft hairs\u201d managed to evoke in me such visceral disgust.", "description": "The wonderfully unique and upsettingly lifelike 'dog's balls shrub' has finally been recognised as a unique species by botanists.", "authors": ["Ben Mcleay"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/dogsballs.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
