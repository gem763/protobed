But that record took a bit of a beating in the company\u2019s previous report in late July, which showed a notable slowdown in revenue and earnings growth for the unit and a rare shortfall against Wall Street\u2019s targets for the operation.\n\nAmazon\u2019s shares have fallen 11% since that report, setting the largest decline among big tech companies slated to post September-quarter results over the next few weeks. Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, is up 9% in that time. It didn\u2019t help Amazon that the Capital One Financial Corp. hack, in which a former AWS employee was accused of stealing more than 100 million records from the lender, was reported just days after its July results. Amazon is also now among the weakest big tech stocks for the year, with an 18% gain to date against the Nasdaq Composite\u2019s 22% climb.\n\nThat has Wall Street smelling a bargain\u2014especially since Amazon is one of the few S&P 500 stocks to have a unanimous \u201cbuy\u201d rating from analysts. Indeed, at around 68 times forward earnings, Amazon\u2019s shares look cheap against the multiple of 100 times forward earnings that the stock has averaged over the past four years, according to FactSet.\n\nBut that also speaks to Amazon\u2019s unique challenge. The company has managed such a heady valuation precisely by giving investors the best of both worlds: a massive, scaled-up business still growing revenue at more than 20% annually while also expanding its bottom line. The cloud segment is a key component in the latter, especially as the company\u2019s retail side now absorbs the costs for taking on more of its own deliveries\u2014and delivering more of those products in a single day.\n\nAnalysts expect AWS revenue to log a rise of 37% for the third quarter to $9.1 billion. Operating income for AWS is projected at about $2.55 billion, which would produce a margin of 28%\u2014up from the 25% reported in the previous quarter. Amazon still has a comfortable lead on cloud challengers including Microsoft and Google, and analysts widely expect overall cloud spending to remain resilient compared with other areas of corporate tech budgets that are getting pinched. But the company\u2019s cloud can ill afford another slip.\n\nWrite to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com", "description": "An AWS target miss and the Capital One hack have punished the highflying stock since its latest report.", "authors": ["Dan Gallagher"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-119689/social", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
