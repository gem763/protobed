If this proves challenging, the regulators should increase the financial sector levies to ensure that they can hire the staff with the expertise and experience required, the MPs said.\n\nThey must maintain a very low tolerance for service disruption by providing guidance on what level of impact should be tolerated, they said. The regulators cannot allow firms to set their own tolerance for disruption too high, the report said.\n\nIndividuals and firms should be held to account for their role in IT failures and poor operational resilience, it added.\n\nMPs said if future incidents occur without sanction, parliament should consider whether the regulators\u2019 enforcement powers are fit for purpose.\n\nTSB suffered a high-profile IT failure last year that left customers unable to access their accounts, following the introduction of a new system.\n\nUp to 1.9 million people lost access to online banking services.\n\nThe MPs said regulators must provide them with the outcome of their investigation into the TSB IT failure as soon as possible.\n\nIt said time and cost pressures may cause firms to cut corners when implementing change programmes, and regulators must adopt a proactive approach to ensure that customers are protected.\n\nMr Baker said: \u201cFor too long, we have waited for a comprehensive account of what happened during the TSB IT failure.\n\n\u201cOur inquiry into service disruption at TSB remains open.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Customers are being left \u201ccashless and cut off\u201d by unacceptable IT failures in the\u00a0financial services sector, the Treasury Committee has said.
