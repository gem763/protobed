It is not uncommon for high-level officials with sensitive dossiers in important ministries to take three or four weeks off, without checking email. The entire country operates on what\u2019s basically an academic schedule. In May and June, people start making appointments for after the rentr\u00e9e\u2014that is, September. Employees have seven weeks of paid holiday time (albeit with lower pay than their counterparts elsewhere).\n\nAnd then there is the news in August. This summer, France Inter, the country\u2019s equivalent of National Public Radio, ran a daily five-minute series just before 8 a.m. The topic was \u201cA Summer With Pascal,\u201d on the life and work of Blaise Pascal\u2014his views on God, the body, justice, free will, his method, his writing style, his reception during the Enlightenment. Vive la France. One of the most famous radio and TV hosts here, L\u00e9a Salam\u00e9, ran a summer series on France Inter called \u201cPowerful Women,\u201d for which she interviewed some of the most powerful women in France\u2014writers, politicians, a rabbi. That powerful women are seen as material for a series that airs only during the summer, when listenership is down, may say something about the state of feminism in France today.\n\nNewsrooms empty out, and so newspapers prepare long summer serials in installments. These are often the most engrossing pieces in all of French journalism. Le Monde\u2019s series included \u201cOn the Planet of the Ultra-Rich,\u201d (in New York, Silicon Valley, private schools), as well as one on the decline of the French Socialist Party. This began with \u201cFran\u00e7ois Hollande: The Original Sin,\u201d about the former French president, and went through the rise of President Emmanuel Macron, who split from the Socialists to form his own party. Le Monde also ran series on DNA evidence and six interviews with feminists (Emma Thompson; the Egyptian author and activist Mona Eltahawy; Inna Shevchenko, a co-founder of the Ukrainian collective Femen.) Good profiles, but again part of the women-as-special-section-in-August phenomenon.\n\nThis summer, the conservative daily Le Figaro\u2019s series included \u201cIntellectuals Forced Into Exile\u201d and\u2014this is classic Figaro\u2014\u201cDescendants,\u201d which began with Laura Keynes, whom it described as \u201cgreat-granddaughter of Darwin and a practicing Catholic.\u201d A few years ago, Le Figaro, the preferred newspaper of France\u2019s conservative upper-class, had an 11-part series following in the footsteps of Napoleon, and another in the footsteps of George Orwell, from Catalonia to Wigan Pier to Burma.\n\nOne drowsy August evening, I turned on French TV to find an in-depth candid-camera investigation into the many and various ways a person can get ripped off in Paris\u2014cabs at the airport who scammed unsuspecting Canadians; a gang of girls who stole a tourist\u2019s cellphone by the Seine; a restaurant that claimed its food was homemade when it wasn\u2019t. \u201cC\u2019est quoi, \u00e7a?\u201d (\u201cWhat exactly is this?\u201d) the reporter leading the investigation asked, with disdain that bordered on horror, as the hidden camera showed her lifting a leaden lump of pale melted cheese out of what was supposed to be homemade French onion soup.", "description": "The French capital empties out in August, but still has energy\u2014just a different sort.", "authors": ["Rachel Donadio"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/AP_19238495458721/facebook.jpg?1567174367"}
