There\u2019s been some pushback to Moreno by people who claim that his professor was just trying to get him to take a position and defend as a teaching tool. In an interview/podcast published Tuesday by Benjamin Boyce, he asked Moreno about this.\n\n\u201cOne of the pushbacks is that maybe he\u2019s just making these absurd claims\u2014he could infinitely hide behind that\u2014he\u2019s trying to teach you to take another point of view and trying to force you to think in an unnatural way, let\u2019s say,\u201d Boyce said.\n\n\u201cYeah, I get why people would think that because these are absurd claims,\u201d Moreno replied. He continued, \u201cBut if you listen to the audio and I think even the audio that I show, these aren\u2019t in the context of a debate round. He\u2019s presenting these positions and we\u2019re supposed to ask him questions if we\u2019re confused, right. And so when I ask him questions, he\u2019s dismissing them.\n\n\u201cIf he were really just presenting these absurd arguments he\u2019d be like \u2018yeah, Michael, you could make those arguments, they might say this but yeah, you could make that argument.\u2019 Instead, he\u2019s like \u2018No, you\u2019re white you can\u2019t speak\u2019 or \u2018No, space doesn\u2019t exist, here\u2019s why.\u2019 We\u2019re not sparring in the debate round, so he has no excuse to be presenting them this way. Nothing in any of the footage suggests that he is just playing the devil\u2019s advocate.\u201d\n\nMoreno said there was another way it became clear that his professor wasn\u2019t just teaching debate techniques. \u201cArguments that kind of go with this anti-white, postmodern, identitarian victim narrative he will give barely any criticism to. He\u2019ll just let them flow by,\u201d Moreno said. He cited a portion of the audio he posted this week in which two black students suggest sending all white people into outer space.\n\n\u201cHis only criticisms were \u2018How are we going to get white people to space,'\u201d Moreno said. He added, \u201cThese are pathetic criticisms to make against their case. Obviously, in any real debate, the main criticism of this argument would be the racist assumptions underlying it against white people, but he does not bring this up at all.\u201d\n\nAs for his motive in recording his professor and putting all of this on YouTube, Moreno said he believes debate as it now exists has become a waste of time and he hopes to reform it into something better by exposing what is going on.\n\n\u201cBy you quitting, they won,\u201d Boyce suggested. \u201cThey kicked you out. They proved that you\u2019re logic is inferior to their power games,\u201d he said.\n\nMoreno\u2019s answer is that he didn\u2019t have a problem staying in the class so long as he was free to disagree, but once his professor indicated he would not be allowed to participate if he were using his own arguments, he felt there was nothing more to be gained.\n\n\u201cI do not think that it is a benefit to learn sophistry and rhetorical manipulation of words. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what debate is about or should be about,\u201d Moreno said.\n\nHere\u2019s the full interview:", "description": "\"Nothing in any of the footage suggests that he is just playing the devil's advocate.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Moreno-Boyce.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
