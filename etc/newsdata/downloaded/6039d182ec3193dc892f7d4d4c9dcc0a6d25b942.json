Going back to school is often a stressful time of year for both parents and children.\n\nOne study found that being a parent is more stressful for mothers than it is fathers, anyway.\n\nAccording to Kelly Musick, an associate professor of policy analysis and management at Cornell University, mothers experience more stress than dads because they are more involved with the day-to-day parenting tasks society expects of them.\n\nFIRST DAY OF SCHOOL PHOTO SHOWING 8-YEAR-OLD COMFORT CLASSMATE WITH AUTISM GOES VIRAL: 'HE HELPED ME AND I WAS HAPPY'\n\nAnother recent survey conducted by the Kiddie Academy found that 62 percent of mothers have the hardest time in the family when it comes to dealing with the first day of school. This stress is a lot more common than you\u2019d think, especially for mothers of younger children.\n\nIt makes perfect sense. Parents are trying to make their child\u2019s life happy and comfortable as they head off to school, and they want to make everything as perfect for their children as they can.\n\nParents suddenly find they must be very pragmatic and check off all the items on the school supply list.\n\nIt is the parent who must acclimate their children to the early to rise school schedule.\n\nLife might be stressful in the moment, but that doesn\u2019t make it unmanageable. Try to turn your negatives into a positive.\n\nParents have to create an upbeat attitude in their children toward school so they can feel comfortable. All these new routines after a relaxed summer are enough to spike anyone's stress hormones. This anxiety often stems from a basic belief that we are not able to control or resolve stressful situations. It\u2019s this feeling that causes us to question our capabilities, overestimate potential dangers, and to doubt positive outcomes.\n\nFor the mother who is sending her child off to school for the very first time, the fear she feels on her child's behalf is very real.\n\nWill her child make new friends?\n\nWill the pressure cause too much stress?\n\nWill his or her new teacher be kind and nurturing?\n\nWill their child feel safe and be safe?\n\nThese concerns are not easy for any parent to manage, especially for new moms.\n\nThe reality is that going to school is a rite of passage all kids and their parents need to experience. It is a milestone moment that can be filled with understandable worry. Still, it\u2019s important and healthy for children to get into a regular routine, to achieve moments of independence and to develop a sense of self-reliance when away from home.\n\nAs the school year begins, it\u2019s essential to keep in mind some trusted ways to combat this common \"back to school angst.\"\n\nRemember, kids will often reflect parents' feelings, so it helps to try to take things one day at a time. Realize you are not alone. Most parents and children are a bit nervous at the beginning of the school year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nHaving said this, It is important for parents to put a calm perspective on re-starting school. The calmer and more positive the parent, the more comfortable the child.\n\nIn order to feel more relaxed, know everything will come together. Don\u2019t overdo it. Take a step back, take little breaks, call another mom-friend who is probably also going through a similar experience.\n\nWe know stress can be harmful to our well-being, so de-stress by having a relaxed and positive conversation with your child about school.\n\nContact friends and family members who are supportive and positive people.\n\nFocus on all the good that school life can bring both you and your child.\n\nLife might be stressful in the moment, but that doesn\u2019t make it unmanageable.
