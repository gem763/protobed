EU leaders meeting in Brussels reiterated their call early Friday for Turkey to end its assault, while noting the pause in the offensive.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu insisted to journalists in Ankara that Turkey was \u201csuspending the operation, not halting it\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is not a ceasefire. A ceasefire is reached between the two legitimate parties.\u201d\n\nAnkara considers YPG militants to be an extension the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) \u2014 a group that has fought a bloody insurgency inside Turkey for 35 years.\n\nTrump hailed the deal, reached after more than four hours of talks led by Pence, as \u201ca great day for civilisation\u201d.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the Kurds, because they were incredibly happy with this solution,\u201d he said during a visit to Texas. \u201cThis is a solution that really \u2014 well it saved their lives, frankly.\u201d\n\nA day after the leak of a letter in which Trump warned Erdogan not to be a \u201cfool,\u201d Trump hailed the Turkish president as \u201ca friend of mine\u201d, adding: \u201cHe\u2019s a hell of a leader.\u201d\n\nErdogan on Twitter called for action to \u201cdefeat terrorism,\u201d saying \u201cI am confident this joint effort will promote peace and stability in our region.\u201d\n\nErdogan, who like Trump has faced political setbacks at home, found wide domestic support for the operation.\n\nBut Trump faced accusations even from usual supporters that his withdrawal of 1,000 US troops \u2014 practically the entire US contingent in the region \u2014 betrayed Kurdish militants who bore the brunt of the fight against the Islamic State group in recent years.\n\nTrump quickly faced renewed attacks over the deal.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to help Turkey push the Kurds out of their home in northern Syria after all they have done to help the US defeat ISIS is outrageous,\u201d said Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat.\n\n\u2013 Erdogan to head to Russia \u2013\n\nErdogan wants to destroy Kurdish hopes of an autonomous enclave that Turkey fears could serve as a launchpad for attacks on its soil.\n\nHe also wants to resettle some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees Ankara is hosting.\n\nJeffrey said Turkey had promised that its presence in the zone would be short, insisting that the United States still recognised Syria\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\n\u201cThe Turks have reassured us many times that they have no intention \u2014 no intention whatsoever, from President Erdogan personally on down today \u2014 of staying in Syria very long,\u201d he said.\n\nThe US pullout has strengthened both Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who for the first time sent troops to the northeast in an agreement with Kurdish forces, and Russia \u2014 Assad\u2019s main backer.\n\nErdogan will meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday \u2014 when the five-day period will come to an end \u2014 in the Black Sea resort of Sochi as both sides seek to prevent a war between Turkey and Syria.\n\nburs/fo-raz-sct/jah", "description": "Ankara (AFP) \u2013 Turkey has agreed to suspend its Syria offensive for five days and will end the assault if Kurdish-led forces withdraw from a safe", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/634304_turkish-soldiers-syrian-rebel-proxies-gained-ground-in-ras-al-ain-key-border-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
