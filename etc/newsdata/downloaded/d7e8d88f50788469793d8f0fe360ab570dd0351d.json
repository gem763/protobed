After giving birth to her second daughter, Kacey, she was straight back to university after just two weeks off.\n\nBut just as she thought her life was about to \u2018finally be easier\u2019 as she neared the end of her final year of studying, she was diagnosed with motor neurone disease.\n\nHer letter continues: \u2018Through every year at university, I thought this is too much, I can\u2019t do this. But I kept pushing myself for my girls.\n\n\u2018Any student nurse knows how hard work life and student life is.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s round the clock, listening to patients, comforting them, changing beds, feeding them\u2026 the list is endless and they are under valued and underpaid.\n\n\u2018Then, at the end of my long hard journey when I could see light at the end of the tunnel, I was diagnosed with MND.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That is unfair. Being diagnosed with a terminal illness is unfair at any age \u2013 but before 30 it\u2019s gut-wrenching.\n\n\u2018Knowing I never got the reward of being in a qualified nurse post after all the work is unfair. It\u2019s unfair two kids are going to lose their mum.\n\nThe student and mum has shared a letter encouraging people to stop moaning about the small stuff (Picture: Jennifer Bell /SWNS.COM)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s unfair that after school, all the kids in Georgia\u2019s class go home and she has to go to Marie Curie sessions. It\u2019s unfair I can\u2019t read my kids a book or sing them a song.\n\n\u2018Most unfair is that MND has been around for so many years and there\u2019s not one thing out there to help or cure it.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s unfair to be told you have MND and its just \u2018bad luck\u2019 and, \u2018We can\u2019t help you\u2019.\u2019\n\nJennifer shared her letter to encourage people to stop moaning about the small stuff and be grateful for being healthy, alongside raising awareness of motor neurone disease.\n\nShe ends the letter by writing: \u2018So before you moan about how you had a crap sleep last night or you can\u2019t be bothered with work or you have a sore throat, maybe think to yourself in the grand scheme of things is this really important?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You only have one life so live it and if there\u2019s something you don\u2019t like change it.\n\n\u2018Stop wishing for more than you have or you will never find happiness as it comes from within.\u201d\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t take life for granted because tomorrow is never guaranteed.\n\n\u2018Life is short, live it properly.\n\n\u2018After spending 28 years of not being content the only thing now that keeps me content is the love of my family and my two beautiful daughters.\n\n\u2018If I had lived the last 28 years not taking things for granted I would have done it the right way\u2026so do it right people, you only have one chance.\n\n\u2018So here\u2019s to finding a cure for MND, appreciating your nurses and the NHS and not taking life for granted.\u2019\n\nWhat is motor neurone disease?
