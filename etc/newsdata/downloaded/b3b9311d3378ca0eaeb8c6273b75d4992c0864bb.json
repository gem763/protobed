Now Its Doubling Down on Steak", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill stock rocketed this year as the restaurant chain has revived its brand without remaking the menu. The burrito maker will change that Tuesday, launching its first major national menu addition under its current management team.\n\nChipotle stock (ticker: CMG) has risen 86% this year through Monday\u2019s close at $799.87. The company is adding carne asada, a sliced steak flavored with squeezes of lime and chopped cilantro, to its menu\u2014though it will be available only to loyalty program members ordering online until Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 16%, while the S&P 500 has gained 20%.\n\nThat makes the new steak, an alternative to its traditional chopped steak (which remains on the menu), Chipotle\u2019s first significant new menu addition under CEO Brian Niccol, who started in early 2018 after joining from Yum Brands \u2019 (YUM) Taco Bell. (Chorizo, which was served up last year, was a callback to a previous offer from 2016.)\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nRather than shake up the menu, Chipotle has focused on strengthening the brand, boosting digital effectiveness, and store-level operations. That has helped boost same-store sales substantially in recent quarters: They rose 10% in the second quarter, ahead of the Street\u2019s consensus expectation.\n\nIt\u2019s also helped Chipotle stock recover, in dramatic fashion, from the depths to which they sunk after food safety concerns made diners loathe to line up for tacos or burrito bowls. (Barron\u2019s took a long look at the company\u2019s comeback in July.)\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, most of the new food options the company has considered\u2014including nachos and quesadillas\u2014have yet to emerge from testing, with the company stressing that any national launch needs to appeal to diners, make financial sense, and not cause fumbles on the assembly line. (A white version of Chipotle\u2019s queso dip is also in tests.)\n\nThe carne asada is considered a limited-time offer, though executives at a media event Monday afternoon didn\u2019t specify a set end time. Instead, they said, the company will determine the length of the offer based on demand\u2014and its supply of the beef it uses in the recipe.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not able to secure the quantity of the raw material\u201d needed to run the offer indefinitely, Nevielle Panthaky, Chipotle\u2019s vice president of culinary and menu development, told Barron\u2019s at the Monday event.\n\nCarne asada could give the stock another lift, some analysts believe, since steak costs more than chicken, potentially boosting check sizes. Currently, steak represents about a fifth of the protein the chain sells.\n\nThe new dish \u201cperformed incredibly well\u201d in the company's Cincinnati and Fresno test markets, said Chris Brandt, Chipotle\u2019s chief marketing officer, in a statement.\n\nEmail David Marino-Nachison at david.marino-nachison@barrons.com.
