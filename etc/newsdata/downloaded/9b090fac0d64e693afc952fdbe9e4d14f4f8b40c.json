Mahoney is proposing a six- to eight-year prison term.\n\n'Horrible abuse'\n\nEmilio's fatal, catastrophic brain injury happened July 9, 2015, but the five-year-old had been suffering what Faulkner described as \"horrible abuse\" for months.\n\nScars on his back indicated the boy had been whipped.\n\nBruises covered his feet, shins, knees, thighs, groin, stomach, chest, arms, face and head.\n\nOn Emilio's left upper arm: a bruise in the shape of an adult-sized grip mark. His right elbow was so swollen and bruised, doctors believed it was broken.\n\nDuring the trial, the judge heard evidence that Perdomo Lopez cut off contact between Emilio and his family in Mexico shortly after the boy's arrival.\n\n\"Emilio must have felt incredibly lonely and abandoned,\" Faulkner told Neufeld.\n\nGrandfather calls boy 'ungrateful demon'\n\nDuring conversations recorded by police, Perdomo Lopez referred to Emilio as an \"ungrateful demon\" whose spirit needed to be cleansed from the family's home.\n\nFaulkner said those \"negative and spiteful terms\" were used by the grandfather in an effort to \"justify the blows.\"\n\nEmilio's mother, Melody Segovia, appeared in the courtroom over closed circuit-TV from Mexico and read a statement written by her mother, Marisol Segovia-Alvarez, who helped raise the boy. She said the family is \"devastated\" at the loss of Emilio.\n\n\"We always remember his graceful ways and his mischief,\" said Segovia through tears.\n\nDuring the trial, the judge heard heartbreaking evidence that a man who worked at a flea market frequented every Sunday by the Perdomo Lopez family became so concerned with Emilio's obvious physical injuries that he called child protective services.\n\nThe man said the boy seemed quiet and afraid. He called the authorities after one Sunday when he saw Emilio was barely able to walk and had a bandage on his head.\n\nPerdomo Lopez's wife, Carolina Perdomo, was to go on trial alongside her husband but earlier this year her charge was stayed by prosecutor Shane Parker.\n\nThe sentence is due to be handed down on Friday.", "description": "Before he was beaten to death by his grandfather, five-year old Emilio Perdomo told his mother he wanted to buy her a house when he grew up.", "authors": ["Cbc Calgary Reporter", "Meghan Grant Is The Courts", "Crime Reporter For Cbc Calgary.", "Follow Her On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5247317.1569349084!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/emilio-perdomo-allan-perdomo-lopez.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
