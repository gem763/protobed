Now, 30 of his songs are getting a second life from Shakespeare\n\nEven in a completely empty theatre, Max Martin manages to disappear, choosing to perch himself on the back row, almost completely hidden in shadow. If you didn\u2019t know whom you were looking for, you would assume the long-haired, 48-year-old Swede, dressed in a black T-shirt, was taking a break from shifting props for that night\u2019s performance of the new jukebox musical & Juliet.\n\nIt seems inconceivable that someone so unassuming could have dominated pop music for more than 20 years, but the statistics speak for themselves. Martin has co-written and co-produced 73 US Top 10 singles for the likes of Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Katy Perry and Britney Spears. Twenty-two went to No 1, with 12 also topping the UK charts. Collectively, these have sold more than 150m copies globally, earning Martin an Oscar nomination, five Grammys and the 2016 Polar Music prize (previously won by Bob Dylan and Patti Smith). Martin\u2019s 22 US No 1s make him the third-most successful songwriter in US chart history, behind only Paul McCartney (32) and John Lennon (26).\n\nHe is the man who introduced the imperishable, if occasionally linguistically questionable, choruses \u201cHit me baby one more time\u201d, \u201cI kissed a girl and I liked it\u201d and \u201cBackstreet\u2019s back, all right!\u201d to karaoke booths everywhere, with songs that were at once dramatic, melancholic and never less than relentlessly catchy. The hugely ambitious & Juliet \u2013 a modern re-telling of Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo & Juliet in which Juliet decides not to kill herself , but to head to Paris in order to live a little \u2013 is woven expertly around 30 of these hits, originally written for artists ranging from Celine Dion to \u2018NSync, the Weeknd to Pink.\n\nMartin hardly ever gives interviews. \u201cI\u2019m not a shy person,\u201d he clarifies as we sit in one of Manchester Opera House\u2019s tiny bars, his accent a mix of Swedish and the Los Angeles drawl of his adopted home. \u201cI just like to stay in the background as much as possible.\u201d\n\nWhen I heard Britney singing I just knew instantly. The way she recorded that song, she added another dimension Max Martin\n\nEver since he earned his first US Top 10 hit in 1997 by co-writing and co-producing fellow Swede Robyn\u2019s Do You Know (What It Takes), Martin has been a self-confessed \u201cstudio nerd tucked away in a basement somewhere\u201d. One rock star due to get the Max treatment assumed the quiet man he had met was an engineer and asked him when Martin was due to arrive.\n\nWe are joined by the writer of & Juliet\u2019s book, David West Read, who, much to Martin\u2019s delight, has shown up in a vintage Britney T-shirt. \u201cYou\u2019re about to find out I love talking,\u201d Martin continues, popping a snus (a moist tobacco bag, popular in Sweden) under his top lip. \u201cWe\u2019ve been putting a lot of work into & Juliet and it\u2019s a new field for me, so I don\u2019t mind talking about this.\u201d\n\nMartin had been toying with the idea of a jukebox musical for years, inspired by Abba\u2019s global behemoth, Mamma Mia! If a feminist retelling of a Shakespeare soundtracked by Spears sounds like the work of someone who has just had a bump to the head, well, that is because it is. \u201cI had hit my head on a kitchen cabinet and couldn\u2019t look at screens or light for a while,\u201d West Read says (he was concussed). \u201cSo I made a playlist of Max\u2019s catalogue and realised that so many of the songs are about young love \u2026 of course Romeo & Juliet came to mind.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bard times \u2026 the cast of Max Martin\u2019s new musical & Juliet. Photograph: Michael Wharley\n\nAs well as getting involved in the auditions and workshops, Martin also recorded the cast album. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be like: \u2018Oh, just do it,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of the songs were written with the artists and co-writers, and so I feel responsible for all these people that have been involved throughout my career.\u201d It also represented something that has perhaps been missing from his, as he calls it, \u201cday job\u201d: risk. If you have done it all, your songs turning Swift, Perry and Grande into superstars, where do you go next? \u201cThere was so much for me to learn here,\u201d he smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to go on autopilot. If I\u2019m feeling uncomfortable then that\u2019s probably where I should be, rather than in a place where I\u2019m like: \u2018I totally got this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe foundations for Martin\u2019s empire were laid during an apprenticeship with Denniz PoP, whose 90s productions for Ace of Base had become international hits. Martin (born Karl Martin Sandberg in Stockholm) had played the French horn at school; when he met PoP (born Dag Krister Volle) he was the frontman of It\u2019s Alive, a Kiss-inspired glam rock band. Discerning that Sandberg had an ear for pop music, PoP \u2013 a fan of pseudonyms \u2013 rechristened him Max Martin and employed him as a songwriter and producer at his Stockholm powerhouse, Cheiron studios. Cheiron\u2019s records would fuse R&B grooves with happy/sad Abba-esque melodies. The former glam rocker Martin brought an edge of bombast and some weapons-grade melodies, soon employed on records for the Backstreet Boys and the British boyband Five.\n\nPoP died of cancer in August 1998, two months before the release of what may be Martin\u2019s most famous creation. ... Baby One More Time, which he wrote singlehandedly, got to No 1 in just about every country it was released. But it almost came to nothing. The demo, Martin remembers, sat lying around for \u201cmaybe six months, a year\u201d and attempts were made to pitch it to \u201creally established artists\u201d. Eventually the Backstreet Boys\u2019 label, Jive, offered it to their new signing, Spears. \u201cWhen I heard her singing, I just knew instantly,\u201d he says. \u201cThe way she recorded that song, she added another dimension.\u201d\n\nAmong the artists who turned it down were TLC, assuming that the line \u201cHit me baby one more time\u201d advocated domestic violence. Martin and his fellow Swedes at Cheiron had meant it simply as slang for \u201ccall me\u201d. Other Martin lyrics of the era also presented problems for West Read when he was weaving them into & Juliet. \u201cIt\u2019s really kind of confusing,\u201d he says of the Backstreet Boys\u2019 I Want it That Way, a song that seems to undermine itself at every turn.\n\n\u201cYou know that\u2019s a thing, right?\u201d Martin beams proudly. \u201cLike: \u2018What does it mean?\u2019 There were forums of people discussing it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One more time \u2026 Max Martin and Britney Spears in 2017. Photograph: Lester Cohen/WireImage\n\nWhile the grammatical error that appears in Ariana Grande\u2019s 2014 EDM stomper Break Free (\u201cNow that I\u2019ve become who I really are\u201d) may have been placed there on purpose \u2013 including a \u201cjuicy line\u201d that sticks in the listener\u2019s memory is a very Max Martin move \u2013 the Backstreet Boys song is a clearer example of Martin\u2019s obsession with words serving the melody, a concept he calls \u201cmelodic math\u201d.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I listened to songs by Abba, Elton John, the Beatles, and I had no idea what they meant, so to me phonetics have always been important,\u201d he explains. \u201cI felt something hearing this music, and it meant something to me. If you can have a great lyric that also phonetically sounds amazing, then you\u2019re golden. But it\u2019s also kind of cool if you write a song and people are emotionally moved without understanding what\u2019s being said. That, to me, is as powerful.\u201d\n\nHe favours simplicity, repetition and instant familiarity over unnecessary complexity, but balks at the idea that his songwriting is governed by strict rules. \u201cIt\u2019s about having tools for when you\u2019re stuck,\u201d he says, leaning in as if divulging a secret. \u201cIf you have a verse that\u2019s super-busy, and you want to take it to the next part, you might want something that has a little more space, so [the listener] can take in the information and not get lost.\u201d\n\nYou can hear this technique on Taylor Swift\u2019s Shake It Off, for example. \u201cThat\u2019s a mathematical way of thinking, it\u2019s not about doing it by feel,\u201d he concedes. \u201cBut if it\u2019s flowing, you don\u2019t need any of that stuff.\u201d He thinks for a moment. \u201cAlso, if there was a hard rule then all of my songs would be huge and, trust me, they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve seen it many many times, what fame does. We\u2019re not made to be that famous, it\u2019s not normal Max Martin\n\nMartin\u2019s early hit rate largely depended on Spears. A handful of their collaborations forms the backbone of & Juliet, tracing a narrative arc that runs from ... Baby One More Time\u2019s \u201cmy loneliness is killing me\u201d to Stronger\u2019s assertive declaration of the opposite (\u201cMy loneliness ain\u2019t killing me no more\u201d). Did you allow yourself a little high five in the studio when you linked those two songs? \u201cEr \u2026 maybe,\u201d he laughs, self-effacing as ever.\n\nHe is keen, too, to give the artists he has worked with credit, even when, as he puts it delicately, \u201csomeone isn\u2019t a songwriter per se\u201d. Britney Spears, for instance. \u201cShe\u2019s a genius,\u201d he says, popping a fresh snus. \u201cSo much had happened to her in that [early period] and she had to grow up quickly. We had conversations with her about what she wanted to do and what she wanted to say.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the world of pop songwriting and production is still dominated by men, easily characterised as ruthless svengalis. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think I\u2019m one of them,\u201d Martin says carefully. \u201cWe try and do our best to make [the studio environment] diverse, welcoming and inclusive. Let\u2019s try and inform and be role models as much as possible in our world and hopefully it will spread.\u201d\n\nJohn Seabrook on The Song Machine: 'There's a dark side to pop' Read more\n\nWould he like to see more female producers? \u201cWomen aren\u2019t encouraged in the right way,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re still programmed to think: \u2018The boys take care of the computers\u2019 and that has to change, and it is changing. Even if you come from a very dark place of,\u201d \u2013 he slips into a convincing American accent \u2013 \u201c\u2018I want to make a lot of money.\u2019 It\u2019s a stupid decision. We\u2019re missing out on 50% of the talent.\u201d\n\nA lot of Martin\u2019s biggest hits have been with female artists: not just Spears, Swift and Perry but also British stars such as Adele, Ellie Goulding and Jessie J. He has seen at close proximity what can happen when unimaginable fame takes hold, not least Spears\u2019s distressing, and hugely publicised, breakdown in 2007. \u201cI think we all should be grateful [to the artists],\u201d he says, growing animated for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for us to say that they become these rich, spoilt divas \u2013 and I\u2019m not talking about Britney specifically, just in general \u2013 but we forget that these artists go out into the world and work and tour and become super-famous for our enjoyment. And then we watch their lives fall apart in front of our eyes for doing something amazing.\u201d\n\nHe sighs. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful that someone actually still wants that job. I\u2019ve seen it many many times, what fame does. And it goes back to why I don\u2019t do interviews. Especially now with social media: our lives are on display all the time and when you\u2019re famous it\u2019s on a whole other level. We\u2019re not made to be that famous, it\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s not in our DNA.\u201d\n\nHis more recent work with the likes of Normani and Grande have seen him embrace the fact that pop\u2019s pendulum has swung away from pop and towards R&B and hip-hop, a shift that \u2013 when it happened in the early 00s with the rise of Pharrell Williams\u2019s songwriting and production outfit the Neptunes \u2013 briefly knocked Martin off course. Does he have similar concerns this time?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to a point where I try not to think about the perception of the work,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first time it happened, when the boyband era crashed in front of my eyes, I was freaking out a bit, but I\u2019ve never really been worried.\u201d That LA breeziness returns. \u201cI\u2019m not [making music] because I want to be successful; I would be doing this anyway. Also, popular culture is supposed to move.\u201d Making records, he says, is \u201cabout staying inspired, but also sticking to your guns of what you love doing\u201d.\n\nSuddenly, the musical\u2019s in-house band starts up next door, a sign that Martin is free to stop doing something he is still learning to love. As we get up to leave, we are joined by a PR who needs to speak to Martin about that evening\u2019s opening press night. One-sided discussions are had about red carpets, photographers and local press, with Martin looking increasingly nervous. \u201cI can still arrive via the side door right?\u201d he says, edging back into the shadows.\n\n& Juliet transfers to the Shaftesbury Theatre, London on 2 November. The cast recording is released on 15 November.\n\nMax power\n\nMartin\u2019s landmark hits, by Ben Beaumont-Thomas\n\n1996: Backstreet Boys \u2013 Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)\n\nHis production would get more sophisticated \u2013 the claps sound like the punching sounds from Street Fighter 2 \u2013 but the songwriting is already rock solid on his first US Top 10 single.\n\n1998: \u2018NSync \u2013 I Want You Back\n\nWith this and Tearin\u2019 Up My Heart, Martin cemented his style of keeningly melancholic minor-key pop; despite their crotch-grabbing tempos, they are among the most savagely sad breakup songs ever.\n\n1998: Britney Spears \u2013 ... Baby One More Time\n\nThe shamelessly provocative video helped her break through, but the song is what matters: one second and three piano notes was all it took to become unforgettable.\n\n2004: Kelly Clarkson \u2013 Since U Been Gone\n\nMartin\u2019s ultra-synthetic pop was innovated out of the zeitgeist by R&B, so he wisely took a different tack. Strident, compressed guitars now underpinned his biggest hits, including another breakup masterpiece with Kelly Clarkson, as well as a string of songs with Pink.\n\n2008: Katy Perry \u2013 I Kissed a Girl\n\nBy riffing on a bit of classic pop \u2013 Gary Glitter\u2019s Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Part 2, currently causing controversy in Joker \u2013 and adding Perry\u2019s lipstick lesbianism, Martin created one of his most muscular, brilliant hits.\n\n2012: Taylor Swift \u2013 We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\n\nMartin runs the acoustic guitars forwards then reverses them, the perfect sonic symbol for Swift stepping back from country and facing forward into pure pop.\n\n2014: Ariana Grande feat Iggy Azalea\u2013 Problem\n\nIn Grande, Martin found a Britney-level foil: someone adept at both his traditional melancholia as well as exuberant sass. A string of brilliantly varied hits ensued.\n\n2016: Justin Timberlake \u2013 Can\u2019t Stop the Feeling!\n\nWith this good angel to the coke-snorting devil that is the Weeknd\u2019s Can\u2019t Feel My Face, another Martin smash the same year, the producer brought an ass-shaking disco sensibility to the middle of the decade.\n\n2019: Sam Smith \u2013 How Do You Sleep?\n\nWith Grande, Martin has helped to define pop\u2019s current dominant mode, where intimacy and sensuality is prized over trashy bombast, and yet still works in the club. This cut with Sam Smith is a beautiful example.", "description": "The man behind two decades of hits for Britney, Ariana, Taylor and more is \u2018thankful\u2019 singers still put themselves out there.
