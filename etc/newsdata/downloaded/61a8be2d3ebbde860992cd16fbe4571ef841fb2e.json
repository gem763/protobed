REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/File Photo\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Operating income at Germany\u2019s BASF (BASFn.DE) dropped 24% during July-September as uncertainty over trade disputes weighed on prices for its basic petrochemicals and foam ingredients.\n\nBASF, the world\u2019s largest chemicals company by sales, said on Thursday that earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), adjusted for one-off items, dropped to 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion), in line with market expectations.\n\n\u201cThe trade conflict between the United States and China is weighing on our business. Moreover, there are uncertainties related to Brexit,\u201d said Chief Executive Martin Brudermueller.\n\n\u201cThese events are acting as a drag on the economy,\u201d he added.\n\nBASF, whose products include vitamins, foams for car seats, engineering plastics and superabsorbers for diapers, reaffirmed earlier projections that adjusted full-year EBIT would be as much as 30% below the year-ago numbers.\n\nHigher earnings in company\u2019s seeds and pesticides as well as specialty chemicals, such as catalytic converters and battery chemicals, cushioned the blow.\n\nCEO Brudermueller is trying to cut costs at the group\u2019s large integrated chemical complexes around the globe, while divesting businesses that are not closely connected with that production network, such as oil and gas as well as BASF\u2019s pigments and construction chemicals businesses.\n\nUnder an ongoing scheme to ramp up cost cuts to an annual rate of 2 billion euros by 2021, BASF said cost cuts would be at around 500 million euros in 2019.\n\n($1 = 0.8981 euros)", "description": "Operating income at Germany's BASF dropped 24% during July-September as uncertainty over trade disputes weighed on prices for its basic petrochemicals and foam ingredients.", "authors": ["Ludwig Burger", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444392583&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0E2", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
