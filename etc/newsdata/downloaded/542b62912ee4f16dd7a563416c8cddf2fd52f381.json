The worst thing about playing an MMORPG with your friends is that it sucks more when they leave you behind.\n\nInstead of hanging out at the local dive bar or playing yet more Super Smash Bros. in someone\u2019s living room, my friends and I decided to spend our weekends running around World of Warcraft Classic as a band of ugly Horde hooligans. Optimistic that we\u2019d stick things out together, we engineered a balanced party\u2014a warrior, a shaman, and a hunter\u2014and excitedly talked over what professions we\u2019d take on to boost the party\u2019s equipment. Meeting in-game together for the first time, we cheered when we took down a tiger three times faster than we had on our own. We spoke in silly role-play voices and acted out ridiculous emotes.\n\nThen, we damned ourselves with a social contract: to wait up for each other if someone levelled too quickly.\n\nWorld of Warcraft Classic is unambiguously better with friends, especially in its early stages. It\u2019s a punishing game that makes you earn the more beautiful zones, the more epic fights, the sexier armour, and the more engaging quests. But because the ramp is so slow, the early game is really grindy.\n\nI wasn\u2019t put off as we headed to the Echo Isles with a log full of quests to collect the cat pelts, the bird eggs, the crab meat, and kill mob after mob after mob. We swam over together, remarking on the excellent shade of the sky and the calming water texture. We gossiped and told jokes. Each bullet point on our huge checklist went by quickly. And then, about halfway through, it was time for bed. We pledged not to level too much before our next session.\n\nFast forward one week. We stuffed into my tiny, Brooklyn home office and all logged into World of Warcraft Classic. I spawned in the Echo Isles. My friends didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHuh,\u201d I said. \u201cYou guys finished these quests already?\u201d\n\n\u201cYup,\u201d they said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll do them with you! It\u2019s fine!\u201d\n\nThey dutifully returned to the islands and messed around underwater while I trawled through the ocean for crabs to axe. They were at least five levels ahead of me, and I felt guilty as they trudged through the same boring quests again.\n\nWe returned to the mainland. I was in awe as we approached the first city, a mass of spindly towers and winding roads lined with shops. It was exquisite, and I couldn\u2019t wait to explore its nooks and crannies. Of course, one of my friends had already seen it. It was nothing new. I got lost on the way to the auction house, and it took forever before I was ready to head out again. Soon after, it was time for bed.\n\nA could of days later, I received a dreaded but inevitable message on Facebook Messenger: \u201cSo about that level 15 cap...\u201d I was level 9.\n\nAs my friends kept chugging through the low-level quests and discovering new zones, I kept finding reasons not to play. The quest I stopped on was boring, or I wasn\u2019t sure I could take on higher-level monsters that might attack without provocation.\n\nI wasn\u2019t in a guild yet, either, and didn\u2019t want to upset my friends by joining one and finding new allies. Other games had fewer barriers to entry before the funtimes: Overwatch, Magic: The Gathering Arena, Control, Fire Emblem: Three Houses. Opening the Battle.net client, I kept urging myself to log onto World of Warcraft Classic and catch up, but the goalpost kept getting pushed further and further away. After some time, the prospect of reaching level 20, level 23, or level 25 alongside my friends simply became unrealistic.\n\nWhen the newness of a new zone was dulled by my friends\u2019 been-there-done-that-ness, I wasn\u2019t getting the World of Warcraft Classic social experience I craved. When the guilt struck after they offered to go back and do some tedious thing, it pushed me further and further into a state of dread and apathy. At first, I thought, I couldn\u2019t be mad that they played a game they bought, and I was happy that my friends were enjoying it.\n\nThen, over Facebook, one asked whether we wanted to do the Instance in Orgrimmar. \u201cI\u2019ll play too,\u201d I said, \u201cunless a low-leveled troll like me is not invited.\u201d The response: \u201cI think you\u2019re too low level for that one, C. But we can do something else\u2026\u201d. Self-pity quickly curdled into a small bit of resentfulness, putting me off even more from logging in and levelling up. I haven\u2019t played in weeks.\n\nMy character wallows alone at level 11. It\u2019s my own fault for letting myself spiral. And yet, it\u2019s easy to get down on yourself in MMORPGs, to feel you\u2019re not getting out of it what other people are when the trappings of success, like armour and new abilities, are worn like badges out in public. To get the most out of this game, I need to recalibrate my character\u2019s goals so they\u2019re individual and not collective. It\u2019s time to envision a new type of game, one where I\u2019m half paying attention while listening to a podcast or one that I play in solitary weekend streaks. Or I can make some new friends...", "description": "The best thing about getting together to play an MMORPG with your friends is knowing you\u2019ll have people to shoot the shit with when you\u2019re grinding out low-level quests.
