And it still outsells every SUV in its segment. However, the ageing Creta is all set to receive a long-overdue update soon. The new Creta will share its platform with the Kia Seltos, and have design cues similar to the smaller Hyundai Venue sub-4 metre SUV. This new Creta (named ix25 elsewhere) is now ready for launch in China. We take a look at one example spotted at a Chinese dealership to see what the 2020 Creta coming to India will look like. Like the Grand i10 Nios, which became the best-selling Hyundai following its launch, we expect the impressive update to the Creta to perform well here as well.\n\nSeen from the front, the ix25 looks like a cross between the Hyundai Venue and the Palisade SUV. It features eyebrow-like LED DRLs like its sub-4 metre sibling. Under it lies the new headlamp housing that gets three-projector units and an L-shaped LED strip. Look closer, and you\u2019ll notice an additional light placed between the DRLs and the headlamp. The ix25 also gets a larger, more imposing version of Hyundai\u2019s cascading grille. In profile, the new vehicle is instantly recognisable as the Creta we all know. At the rear, the taillamps sit far below the windshield under the beltline of the car.\n\nOn the inside, the updates are significant. An all-new dual-tone dashboard features a vertical touchscreen infotainment system, while the steering wheel is similar to the one in the Venue. The new SUV is slightly larger than the Creta that is currently on sale in India; it\u2019s 10mm wider, 30 mm longer and gets a 20mm longer wheelbase. This could translate into more cabin space in the 2020 Creta.\n\nThe 2020 Creta is based on the Kia Seltos, and may get the latter\u2019s BS6-compliant engines. The Seltos is available with three engine options - a 1.5-litre diesel, a 1.5-litre petrol, and a 1.4-litre turbo-petrol. The diesel makes 115PS and 250Nm of torque. The larger petrol makes 115PS and 144Nm of torque, while the turbo-petrol makes 140PS and 242Nm of torque.\n\nThe current Creta is priced from Rs 9.6 lakh to Rs 15.65 lakh. However, the new model is expected to cost more thanks to its new range of BS6-compliant engines.", "description": "The China-spec Hyundai Creta sports sweet proportions and soft curves", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.zigcdn.com/media/content/2019/Oct/zw-ix25-6_300x225.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
