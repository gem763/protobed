At that rate, Bitcoin passes PayPal\u2019s annual transaction volume \u2014 $578 billion for 2018 \u2014 in just two months.\n\nPlanB used his Bitcoin full node to verify the transaction data. The numbers underscore the continued interest in Bitcoin, coming despite the bearish price action in the second half of 2019.\n\nCan BTC overtake Visa and Mastercard in ten years?\n\nIts ability to beat out major fiat alternatives including Visa and Mastercard is meanwhile nothing new. As Cointelegraph reported, in April, new research even suggested that Bitcoin could overtake the fiat payment heavyweights by 2029.\n\n\u201cIn just 10 years, Bitcoin has managed to compete with the leaders of the payment system industry. Bitcoin\u2019s development is occurring exponentially,\u201d analysis firm DataLight concluded at the time.\n\nIn the future, as the development of off-chain scaling solutions such as the Lightning Network brings new advances, less and less activity in Bitcoin will occur on the blockchain. This, commentators note, should ensure current block sizes cope with demand.\n\nEarlier this month, Samson Mow, CSO of Bitcoin technology company Blockstream, suggested that there is already more than enough spare capacity in Bitcoin.", "description": "Bitcoin\u2019s transaction activity on the blockchain dwarfs competitors around for longer, notably PayPal, whose annual volume Bitcoin beats in just 60 days", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZDE3Njc1ODZiNDU0MDI4OTJhODA5YmJkYTMxNTYzNjcuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
