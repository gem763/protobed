U.S. citizens can now sue Cuban regime companies for trafficking in stolen American property. For the next 30 days, Americans can bring legal action against 205 companies that are owned and operated by the Cuban military, intelligence, and security services. These recent actions are in response to the Cuban regime\u2019s continued human rights abuses and destabilizing role in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cNearly 6,000 Americans and U.S. entities had their property and assets \u2013 worth an estimated value of nearly $8 billion \u2013 seized during Fidel Castro\u2019s revolution. The Castro regime\u2019s confiscation of Cuban-American assets is believed to be even higher.\u201d\n\nQuintana: \u201cWith this action, the Trump administration has dealt a blow to Cuba\u2019s police state that empowers and protects Venezuelan Pres. Nicolas Maduro. Havana has aided Maduro\u2019s destruction of Venezuela and should be held accountable. Ultimately, if U.S. partners and allies want to successfully address the Maduro regime, they must also amplify efforts against Cuba.\u201d\n\nCarafano: \u201cSince the Cuba sanctions were codified into law in 1996, U.S. administrations have refused to implement this component of the law. Today, the Trump administration took an encouraging step in allowing Americans to seek justice for their stolen property. More broadly, it also reinforces the U.S.\u2019 efforts on Venezuela.\u201d", "description": "Washington, D.C. -- Ana Quintana,\u00a0Heritage senior policy analyst for Latin America, and James Carafano, Heritage vice president for national security and foreign policy, responded Monday to the White House\u2019s historic enforcement of Cuba sanctions:", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
