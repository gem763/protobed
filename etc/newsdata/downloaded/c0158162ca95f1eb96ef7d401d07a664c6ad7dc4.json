For every 100 men promoted to those roles, the study found, only 72 white women were promoted. The numbers are even worse for women of colour - only 58 black women and 68 Latina women were promoted for every 100 white men.\n\nPart of the problem, Huang said, is due to lack of awareness on the part of both employees and human resources departments about the gaps. Companies also have to understand the issues before they can remedy them.\n\n\"They've been focusing a lot of energy on taking action at more senior levels and they haven't carried that down to the manager level,\" Huang said, suggesting that promotions and hiring practices could be more fair and inclusive.\n\nGender stereotypes\n\nSome of the disparity in who is chosen for management roles comes from stereotypes about women, said Caitlyn Collins, an assistant professor of sociology at Washington University in St Louis and the author of Making Motherhood Work: How Women Manage Careers and Caregiving.\n\n\"Women, by definition, are seen as less capable and less committed at work because they are associated with all these gender-essentialist beliefs,\" Collins told Al Jazeera.\n\nCollins pointed to research by Shelley Correll at Stanford University on status discrimination, probing stereotypes about how are naturally more emotional, nurturing or focused on relationships than men. Women can be penalised if they are perceived as behaving outside of those stereotypes.\n\n\"They've defied these gendered beliefs about femininity,\" Collins explained, adding that women now are generally perceived as more competent but also often as \"aggressive and pushy\".\n\nRachel Thomas, the cofounder and CEO of LeanIn.org, the organisation behind the Women in the Workplace study, said meaningful change is possible.\n\nThomas emphasised setting targets for diversity, giving employees training to spot unconscious bias and making sure there are consistent practices for evaluating people.\n\nMyth of 'opting out'?\n\nThe study also discredited two commonly held beliefs about why women are not promoted in the workplace: because they are opting out to have children or simply not asking for raises.\n\nIn fact, less than two percent of people who said they were planning to leave their companies did so because of family obligations, and women are \"asking for promotions and negotiating salaries at the same rates as men\", the study found.\n\nThe study also showed that women and men are beginning to take paid family leave to care for children at similar rates.\n\nThomas hopes that \"a lot of the stigma or kind of age-old stereotypes around being a new parent ... will start to fall away.\"\n\nBut that has yet to happen. While the average length of paternity leave has quickly increased from four weeks in 2016 to seven weeks in 2019, average maternity leave has remained stagnant at 10 weeks. And among employees who take leave, \"women are more likely to say they've had negative impacts on their career trajectory,\" Huang said.\n\nMicroaggressions at work\n\nThe study also found that while the majority of women have reported experiencing microaggressions - everyday slights rooted in bias - there is a disconnect in people recognising and reporting them. In the study, 33 percent of women and 11 percent of men said they had seen or heard biased behaviour towards women in the past year, but only one-third of people say they personally spoke up about it.\n\nPerspectives about what constitutes bias may also be impacted by broader trends in US political culture, and attitudes towards women in the workplace do not happen in a vacuum, Collins said. The rise of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements - as well as the words of leaders like US President Donald Trump - have also influenced workplace dynamics.\n\nCollins added that having Trump in a position of such institutional power \"sends a message to people that [disrespect] is acceptable\".\n\nBut positive changes have an impact, too, including the record number of women serving in Congress, Thomas added.\n\n\"We will have more women standing on a stage running for president [on Tuesday night] than we've ever had before,\" said Thomas, cautioning not to \"lose sight of what's happening day-to-day in the workplace\".\n\n\"Although we do see some bright spots at the top of the pipeline, we know that women continue to be significantly underrepresented.\"", "description": "More women are in the C-suite than four years ago, but the management ladder remains a huge obstacle to true parity.", "authors": ["Kaelyn Forde", "About The Author"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/96eabeed70fc47e4bb173cd34a73c34c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
