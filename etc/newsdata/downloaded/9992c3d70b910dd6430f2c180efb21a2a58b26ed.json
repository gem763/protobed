Enough people are involved, Pfeiffer said, that it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d of the administration not to release exactly what Trump has promised: \u201cthe complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they release anything that looks less like a verbatim transcript,\u201d said Pfeiffer, who also spent roughly three decades in the National Security Agency and Central Intelligence Agency, \u201cthere are a handful of people involved in this process who could be fact witnesses for whether what was released is what was actually said.\"\n\nDuring the two years he led the Situation Room, organizing calls with foreign leaders behind the scenes was one of his main responsibilities, he said. He was the guy who sat at the end of the couch in the Oval Office, ready to provide any technical support should something go wrong. He\u2019d wait for Obama to signal he was ready to hop on the call, and in turn, Pfeiffer said, he would notify the folks in the Situation Room: the transcribers. Depending on the call, Pfeiffer said he typically assigned two or three of them.\n\n\u201cThese guys and gals would be seriously hammering away at the keyboard, trying to capture the call as best as they could,\u201d said Pfeiffer, now the director of the Michael V. Hayden Center for Intelligence, Policy, and International Security at George Mason University. \u201cAt the end of the call, those two or three people would get together and compare their transcripts and come up with a unified transcript.\u201d\n\nHe said when he first started in the Situation Room, he asked his predecessor why they didn\u2019t just record the phone calls rather than going through all the trouble of this furious transcription. \u201cThe answer I got was \u2018Oh God, no. They haven\u2019t recorded those calls since the early \u201970s,\u2019\u201d Pfeiffer recalled. After that, he said he didn\u2019t feel the need to inquire any further.\n\nOnce the team of transcribers finalized their work, Pfeiffer said, the transcript would be sent to the National Security Council directorate staff with firsthand knowledge of the circumstances the president may have been discussing with foreign leaders. They would correct the transcript for accuracy, make edits for eloquence and clarity \u2014 or sometimes simply reduce the entire transcript to a short summary, Pfeiffer said. Whatever they chose to do, that document would become the final memorandum and official record of the phone call, Pfeiffer said.\n\nOthers say no precise transcripts are kept by the White House, as one former National Security Council senior director told the Wall Street Journal. Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Twitter Tuesday, \u201cWhat you tend to have is a memo prepared by a NSC staffer listening in that captures what he/she believes are main points.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly what type of document Trump\u2019s administration plans to release of his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nPfeiffer said the procedures he practiced had been in place for years in the White House, but he cautioned that he is not privy to any changes the Trump administration may have made to the rules. Trump, for example, had been furious in 2017 after The Post published leaked transcripts of his phone calls with the Australian prime minister and Mexican president, leading the administration to curtail public and private availability of readouts summarizing the calls. The White House didn\u2019t immediately return a message about its current procedures for such calls.\n\nStill, Pfeiffer described Trump\u2019s decision to release the rough transcript as remarkable.\n\n\u201cPresidential head-of-state phone calls are so deeply protected by executive privilege, it\u2019s frankly remarkable that the president is actually releasing a transcript of his call,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented. It\u2019s unusual. And the internal operations of the White House around specific events and calls is normally something that is very highly protected under executive privilege. So it will be interesting to see whether the existence of an impeachment inquiry changes that.\u201d\n\nNixon famously asserted executive privilege to block the release of tapes capturing his coverup of the Watergate scandal, defying a congressional subpoena ordering him to turn most of them over. The tapes captured thousands of hours of conversations recorded from the Oval Office, a practice that stopped after Watergate.\n\nAt first, he gave Congress 19 tapes \u2014 but when they requested 42 others, Nixon instead handed over only transcripts.\n\nIn a presidential address to the nation announcing their release, he insisted to the public that the transcripts would exonerate him. \u201cI want there to be no question remaining about the fact that the president has nothing to hide in this matter,\u201d he said on April 29, 1974. He explained that he edited the 1,200 pages of transcripts to remove \u201cirrelevant\u201d information that was not subject to Congress\u2019s subpoena, citing executive privilege and privacy concerns, promising the rest would be sufficient.\n\nBut to House leaders, it wasn\u2019t. Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr. (D-N.J.) had said \u201cwe will accept nothing less\u201d than the tapes \u2014 and months later, they got them.\n\nIn July 1974, the Supreme Court ruled against Nixon\u2019s claims of executive privilege and ordered the release of the tapes. The court acknowledged some presidential communications should be confidential but said that right was not unlimited, that a president can\u2019t simply assert a \u201cgeneralized need for confidentiality\u201d if the information is needed in a criminal trial, in that case the Watergate break-in.\n\nSixteen days later, Nixon resigned.\n\nOn Tuesday, like Rodino decades ago, both Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) demanded nothing less than the release of the full whistleblower complaint.\n\nThe complaint involves Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky, in which Trump has admitted asking Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, one of Trump\u2019s potential 2020 rivals, and Biden\u2019s son Hunter. Trump made the call to Zelensky days after he directed that nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine be withheld, The Post reported Monday. An anonymous intelligence official was so troubled by the exchange that he filed a complaint, describing an alleged \u201cpromise\u201d Trump made in the call. Under congressional pressure, Trump ultimately released the funds.\n\nSo far, the Trump administration has stonewalled Congress\u2019s requests for the full complaint, as Trump has denied there was any quid pro quo between his request to investigate Biden and the military aid.\n\nThe rough transcript of the call itself, Schumer said, would only provide Congress with an incomplete picture of what the whistleblower found so troubling. The complaint is said to cover more than just the phone call.\n\n\u201cWe need the complaint as sent to the [inspector general],\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWithout the complaint, we don\u2019t know what the IG thought was so urgent. We do not know what the whistleblower thought was so urgent. So simply to release the transcript is not going to come close to ending the need of the American Congress and the public to see what actually happened.\u201d\n\nTrump has insisted the rough transcript of the call will clear him of any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nonsense,\u201d Trump told reporters Tuesday. \u201cWhen you see the call, when you see the readout of the call, which I assume you\u2019ll see at some point, that call was perfect. It couldn\u2019t have been nicer.\u201d", "description": "To some critics, Trump's willingness to turn over the transcript of the call, but not the whistleblower complaint it generated, sounds a lot like President Richard M. Nixon's agreement to turn over the transcripts but not the tapes.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/56vWurgd1CWmtxYS4cWmSCmbbbA=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-24-2019/t_162bbc14e73b4a2abdd5c4eb14e3ad79_name_96f244aa_dbd4_11e9_a1a5_162b8a9c9ca2__1_.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
