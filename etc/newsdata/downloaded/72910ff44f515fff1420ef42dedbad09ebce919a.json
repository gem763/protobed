We are going to work round the clock to try to secure it.\"\n\nBut EU diplomats were pessimistic about the chances of Johnson's hybrid customs proposal for the Irish border issue.\n\n\"We are not very optimistic,\" a senior EU diplomat told Reuters.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nIt raises the possibility of an emergency EU summit at the end of the month to finally approve any 11th hour deal.\n\nAt the State Opening of Parliament, the Queen\u2019s Speech stopped short of repeating Mr Johnson\u2019s explicit promise to leave the EU on Halloween come what may.\n\nMr Johnson faces a major Commons showdown when he returns to Westminster after the summit for an emergency Saturday sitting of Parliament, the first since the Falklands War.\n\nIf he fails to get a deal, he is expected to ask MPs to vote on a no deal Brexit . Opposition MPs could also attempt to table a vote on a second referendum.\n\nBut No 10 said Mr Johnson would not resign if MPs voted down the Queen\u2019s Speech next week - and could even plough on and introduce the bills regardless.", "description": "Michel Barnier said it was still possible to get a deal this week - but time is running out for Boris Johnson ahead of Thursday's crunch EU summit", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Pippa Crerar", "Image", "Reuters", "Jessica Taylor Uk Parliament Handout Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20582366.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EUs-Chief-Brexit-Negotiator-Michel-Barnier-attends-the-General-Affairs-council-addressing-the-state.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
