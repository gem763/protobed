Yesterday, however, this bullish momentum grinded to a halt when Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted below $10,000, which may spell trouble for the markets in the near-term.\n\nIn spite of this potential bearishness, one prominent crypto analyst is now noting that one piece of on-chain data may signal an underlying bullishness for the cryptocurrency, which may mean that today\u2019s drop is simply a flash in the pan that is ultimately followed by an extension of its recent established upwards momentum.\n\nBitcoin Dips Below $10,000 in Sharp Overnight Movement\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading down nearly 3% at its current price of $9,920, which marks a slight retrace from its 24-highs of $10,300 and an even steeper drop from its weekly highs of nearly $10,500.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s inability to maintain its position within the five-figure price region certainly signals that bears may currently have a slight edge over bulls, and it also points to the possibility that BTC will once again revisit its historically established support level around $9,300.\n\nIn the near-term, it does appear that BTC\u2019s bulls and bears are currently locked in a tight battle, and the low-$10,000 region may mark a turning point where the crypto\u2019s near-term trend grows increasingly clear.\n\nThe Cryptomist, a popular crypto analyst on Twitter, spoke about the importance of this level, explaining that she expects BTC to move upwards towards $10,050, which is where it may once again incur significant selling pressure that sends it reeling lower.\n\n\u201c$BTC: There was the drop mentioned. However, am little surprised at the strength of the bulls. I do see bulls pushing this back up to 10050 range, where we could load up for another drop. No bias however, waiting for 10050,\u201d she explained.\n\n$Btc There was the drop mentioned.\n\nHowever, am little surprised at the strength of the bulls I do see bulls pushing this back up to 10050 range, where we could load up for another drop.

MVRV ratio gives a good idea of exchange price relationship to \u201cfair value\u201d of a Bitcoin. MVRC <= 1 has been an excellent buy every time,\u201d he explained while pointing to the below chart that shows that Bitcoin\u2019s MVRC is currently well below 1.\n\nWith $BTC continuing it's month long chop, I've been learning more about on-chain metrics.
