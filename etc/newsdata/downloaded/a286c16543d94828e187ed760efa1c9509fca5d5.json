It\u2019s the only way to stop the world\u2019s criminals flourishing in the UK | Nicholas Shaxson", "language": "en", "text": "The trouble with getting into a rat race, the American comedian Jackie Gleason once said, is that even if you win you\u2019re still a rat.\n\nInfluential people in the UK are cheerleading for a \u201cSingapore on the Thames\u201d economic model after Brexit: a strategy to win the great global race to attract financial capital by lowering taxes, loosening regulations and turning a blind eye to the world\u2019s dirty money. Britain is already, on some measures, the biggest player in the global tax haven game. A spider\u2019s web of satellite havens, from the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands to Jersey, captures wealth from around the world, polishes it and feeds it to the City of London. The world\u2019s best known independent rankings of tax havens by importance \u2013 the Tax Justice Network\u2019s financial secrecy index and its sister publication, the corporate tax haven index \u2013 both show that the UK, considered together with its satellites, is the biggest player in the offshore world.\n\nWe need a revolutionary overhaul \u2013 first we must overthrow an ideology, one that is sometimes called 'competitiveness'\n\nA new report from Transparency International, provides the latest evidence of the devastation Britain\u2019s offshore spider\u2019s web causes globally. It tots up \u00a3325bn of funds \u201cdiverted by rigged procurement, bribery, embezzlement and the unlawful acquisition of state assets\u201d, from more than 100 countries \u2013 mostly in Africa, the former Soviet Union, Latin America and Asia. The financial criminals include a kingpin of a multibillion-pound scam to loot Malaysia, and a jailed former Moldovan prime minister. \u201cPeppered throughout most major cases of bribery, embezzlement and rigged procurement,\u201d says Transparency International, \u201cyou will find a UK nexus.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem. I don\u2019t disagree with the report\u2019s recommendations: open up crime-infested corporate registries in the UK and its offshore territories (some limited progress is evident here, after sustained campaigning); get businesses to apply \u201cethical principles\u201d, improve oversight and enforcement, and create credible deterrents for bosses of all those crime-dealing City firms.\n\nFine. But this report reminds us just how little progress we\u2019ve made, and how widely and deeply the rot has spread. The world\u2019s crooks find accomplices in our purveyors of private jets and yachts, our estate agents, the \u201cbig four\u201d accounting firms, globe-striding banks, schools, universities, football clubs, thinktanks and newspapers \u2013 and, of course, across our political establishment.\n\nWe need a complete, revolutionary overhaul. Yet if we want to take on this giant network of vested interests, we must first overthrow an ideology: something that sometimes gets called \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d.\n\nOn the one hand, most British voters hate it when poor countries get looted, and hate being tainted by dirty money. On the other hand, though, we like the dirty money that flows in. Crackdowns may help others abroad, people fret, but they may make us less competitive, ultimately hurting us. And, they also worry, if we stop doing these bad things, someone else will. This ideology is a recipe for inaction. But there is now a way to change this record. A new tune is being played by two unlikely saviours: the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers\u2019 bank. Since 2012, they have spearheaded a growing body of academic research known as Too Much Finance? \u2013 a foundation of what I call the \u201cfinance curse\u201d.\n\nStudy after study now finds a nonlinear relationship between the size of a country\u2019s financial sector and its long-term economic growth. Every nation needs banking and finance, but only up to the point where it provides all the useful services the country needs: taking deposits, lending, handling business payments and so on. But once finance expands beyond this ideal size and the aforementioned roles \u2013 the City of London passed this point long ago \u2013 it turns nasty. It reduces economic growth, boosts inequality, distorts the economy and curbs entrepreneurialism and productivity (the UK\u2019s is about 10% below France\u2019s or Germany\u2019s, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). A study by Sheffield University last year estimated that the UK had lost a cumulative \u00a34.5tn in income between 1995 and 2015 due to the City\u2019s bloated size.\n\nThe reasons for this \u201ccurse\u201d are many but include a drain of talented people into highly paid City jobs from other parts of the economy and from government. People who might have devised cures for Alzheimer\u2019s or led a dynamic, forward-looking political party into power instead get rich as wealth managers to Kazakh oligarchs.\n\nAs finance grows, its collective attention turns away from useful activities that help support the creation of wealth towards often more profitable activities extracting it \u2013 from other parts of the economy, from the environment and from foreigners. Oversized finance also delivers crippling financial crises. Foreign dirty money flowing into British real estate helps the one-percenters prosper but hurts the UK overall: not just for the reasons above, but by inflating property prices, pushing millions down or off the property ladder, or deeper into mortgage debt. In short, too much finance makes us poorer.\n\nThe WeWork debacle should be an indictment of modern finance | Nesrine Malik Read more\n\nThe implications of understanding the finance curse are hopeful \u2013 and immense. Growing the City of London by making it more competitive is exactly the wrong goal for us to be pursuing. To prosper, we must shrink it, down to its economy-supporting core.\n\nHow? One way is to deliberately deter harmful financial inflows through \u201csmart capital controls\u201d. I don\u2019t mean blocking financial flows at the border: I mean by doing the right thing. Tax billionaires and multinationals effectively, crack down properly on all those who take crooked money from overseas, and implement radical, widespread transparency. In short, the opposite of a tax-haven strategy. Not only will this curb corruption in poorer countries, but the finance curse analysis shows it will make the UK better off overall.\n\nShrink the City, for prosperity\u2019s sake. We have literally nothing \u2013 and no time \u2013 to lose.\n\n\u2022 Nicholas Shaxson is the author of The Finance Curse: How Global Finance is Making us All Poorer", "description": "Dodgy cash has spread across the country, boosted by Britain\u2019s opaque and oversized financial sector, says Nicholas Shaxson, author of The Finance Curse", "authors": ["Nicholas Shaxson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b861796e6a51fa98adbafa33457b50e85f267a84/0_192_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=74aae82d9d80b47de7bb548b12537c9c", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
