(AP) - Losing the free agent running backs San Francisco signed the past two offseasons to injuries did little to slow down the 49ers ground game.\n\nA trio of undrafted free agents is making sure the Niners don\u2019t miss a beat.\n\nMatt Breida, Raheem Mostert and Jeff Wilson Jr. combined for San Francisco\u2019s sixth most productive rushing day of the past decade last week in Cincinnati, leading the team to 259 yards on the ground and two touchdowns and creating the threat that fueled the play-action passing game from Jimmy Garoppolo.\n\nIt was an impressive performance from three players who entered the league with little notoriety. Breida, Mostert and Wilson all failed to get drafted but are proving they can play now that they\u2019ve gotten the chance.\n\n\u201cWhen you come in the league undrafted, usually you\u2019re last on the depth chart and they don\u2019t expect you can play,\u201d Breida said Wednesday. \u201cYou have to prove you can belong in the league.\u201d\n\nThe three are doing just that, making sure the Niners don\u2019t miss Jerick McKinnon and Tevin Coleman, who were supposed to be the center pieces of the running game.\n\nMcKinnon, who signed a four-year, $30 million contract in 2018, has yet to see the field in San Francisco because of a pair of knee injuries that have sent him to injured reserve before the start of the season each year.\n\nColeman signed a two-year, $8.5 million contract this offseason but sprained his ankle in the season opener at Tampa Bay and will be sidelined for at least a few weeks.\n\nThat opened the door for the cheaper crop of backs to step up and they are making the most of their opportunities.\n\n\u201cI always look at how much they get that we block for and then they are paid for what they get after. All three of our guys broke a lot of tackles and did a great job,\u201d coach Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cIf you want one guy to do it all on his own you might have to always go for a top-five pick and you\u2019re going to be disappointed until Barry Sanders comes around. I never feel like running the ball with just one guy, it\u2019s got to take everyone.\u201d\n\nBreida is one of four backs to average at least 5.0 yards per carry the past three years with a minimum of 250 attempts, showing the patience to find the hole in San Francisco\u2019s zone-running scheme and the speed to break long runs when he gets the chance.\n\nBreida has 11 runs of at least 20 yards the past two seasons, trailing only former top 10 picks Saquon Barkley, Todd Gurley and Ezekiel Elliott and second-rounder Nick Chubb.\n\nHe had 12 carries for 121 yards last week and has been at his best when Shanahan has been able to limit his playing time to make sure he doesn\u2019t wear down.\n\n\u201cHe always hits the right hole and that\u2019s why he was hard to get off the field last year, even when he wasn\u2019t always 100%,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cBreida\u2019s also as tough as any running back I\u2019ve been around, but it\u2019s also very important to keep him fresh.\u201d\n\nThat was difficult at times last year but was possible in large part last week because of the emergence of Mostert, a special teams standout who carried the ball only eight times his first three seasons in the NFL. But he showed flashes last season with 28 carries for 250 yards during a four-game stretch that ended when he broke his arm against the Raiders.\n\nMostert is healthy again and off to a good start this year with 22 carries for 123 yards the first two weeks, to go along with a 39-yard TD on a screen pass last week.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t really know our abilities,\u201d Mostert said of the scouts who overlooked him and Breida. \u201cIt was pretty cool, going out there and competing together and doing what we love to do and showing we can play. We were just having fun.\u201d\n\nWilson began this season on the practice squad after providing a late-season spark last year. He got called up last week to replace Coleman and showed the toughness to provide two TD runs in the red zone.\n\nThe success of that running game played a big role in Garoppolo\u2019s success last week. He went 10 for 10 for 213 yards and two TDs for a perfect passer rating of 158.3 when using play action against the Bengals, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\n\u201cWhen you rush the ball for 250 yards, that makes everything a lot easier,\u201d Garoppolo said. \u201cThose guys up front, selling the run, getting downhill on guys, the defense has to respect the run when you\u2019re running it for whatever, 10 yards a carry, something like that. Just all those things coming together.\u201d\n\nNOTES: DE Dee Ford missed practice with irritation in his quadriceps and is day to day. \u2026 S Jaquiski Tartt (toe), WR Jalen Hurd (back), WR Trent Taylor (ankle) also missed practice and DB Jimmie Ward (finger) was limited.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Losing the free agent running backs San Francisco signed the past two offseasons to injuries did little to slow down the 49ers ground game.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/49ers_bengals_football_92790_c0-131-3131-1956_s1770x1032.jpg?e941af7d0fc3ffae8e2274a3f1e26d6e2a6d1c9d", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
