Despite what should be a fairly obvious problem in the whole Separation of Church and State thing, candidates seem to do this every cycle. The big takeaway from his sermon, er\u2026 speech, was that he wants to show the country that he\u2019s as woke as the rest of the field when it comes to problems of systemic racial inequity. To that end, he assured the congregation that he\u2019s fully aware that white people just don\u2019t get it. (Associated Press, emphasis added)\n\nBiden\u2019s appearance comes at an inflection point for Democrats\u2019 2020 leader in the polls. He is trying to capitalize on his strength among older black voters while navigating criticism from some African American and other nonwhite leaders, particularly younger ones, who take a skeptical view of the 76-year-old white man\u2019s willingness and ability to address systemic racism. During his 20 minutes at the pulpit, Biden condemned institutional racism as the direct legacy of slavery and lamented that the nation has \u201cnever lived up to\u201d the ideals of equality written into its founding documents. But then he added a more personal note \u2014 perhaps the closest he would come to addressing his detractors. \u201cThose who are white try,\u201d Biden said, \u201cbut we can never fully understand.\u201d\n\nWhite people are the worst, aren\u2019t they?\n\nLook, I get what Biden is trying to do here. He owes his frontrunner status \u2013 particularly in states like North Carolina \u2013 to the strong support he receives from black voters. And that support is seen as possibly being in jeopardy after a series of gaffes where he\u2019s come off looking entirely tone-deaf on questions of race. (We\u2019ll have more on the record player moment later today.) So this trip was probably pitched as a bit of damage control. In that regard, he seemed to do pretty well.\n\nI also can\u2019t entirely disagree with his message, at least in theory. The majority of black and white Americans have very different experiences growing up in America even today. But that really applies to anyone. Growing up Asian, Hispanic, Jewish or Muslim will also result in unique experiences and challenges, as much as some of us might like to think otherwise. And believe it or not, growing up white if you are poor, despite having some inherent advantages, is also no picnic. Perhaps sharing more of our experiences could help alleviate the situation a bit, but I\u2019m no expert on that.\n\nBut nothing is going to change on the racial divide front just because one politician showed up at a primarily black church and said white people can\u2019t understand. And it\u2019s unclear if this is going to be an effective damage control measure. But the other question is whether or not Biden actually needed any damage control. We\u2019ll have to wait through a couple of polling cycles to know for sure, but Biden\u2019s support among black voters has been strong from the beginning. And those voters already knew that he\u2019s an ancient white man in his seventies who frequently puts his foot in his mouth. I think his relationship with Barack Obama buys him a lot of forgiveness on that front.\n\nI\u2019m willing to offer Crazy Uncle Joe a nickel\u2019s worth of free advice here. If his support among black voters doesn\u2019t significantly tank by the end of the week, he should probably close the book on this chapter of the campaign and get back to his usual schtick. The more he talks about race, the greater the chance he\u2019ll have another record player moment and seriously start digging his own grave.", "description": "White people are the worst, amirite?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/BidenStaresOutOvalOffWindow715.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
