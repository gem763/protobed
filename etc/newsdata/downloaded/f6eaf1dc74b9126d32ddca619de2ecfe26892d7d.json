The chip giant is expected to report adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share on $4.56 billion in revenue, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg.\n\nDespite the fact that most semiconductor companies have been caught in the crosshairs of the more than yearlong U.S.-China trade war, Micron and the rest of the industry has managed to outperform the broader market this year.\n\nMicron shares have rallied 55% this year, while the ETF tracking semiconductor stocks, SMH, jumped 38% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 20% in the same time period.\n\nTuesday at the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump addressed world leaders and mentioned that he had previously met with Micron CEO to chat about the difficulties chip companies are facing due to the trade war and tariffs.\n\nMicron beat both on the top and bottom lines in its fiscal third quarter, and the stock soared on the results. Management said that if Huawei were to remain on the U.S. entity list through 2020, Micron would see an impact and that it would ultimately impact its revenue. According to the company, Chinese tech giant Huawei represented about 13% of Micron\u2019s total sales for the first six months of fiscal 2019.\n\nThe options market is implying a 8% move in either direction for Micron stock following its earnings release.\n\nYahoo Finance All Markets Summit More\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
