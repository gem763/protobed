Burfict was ejected from the game. Now he's been handed the longest punishment for an on-field act in NFL history. #VontazeBurfict #raiders #nfl pic.twitter.com/qgF2io60uI \u2014 Anthony Leong (@anthonyleong83) September 30, 2019\n\nThough, in an interview with TMZ Sports, Romanowski called the NFL\u2019s suspension of Burfict, \u201cB*llsh*t. He also likened football to a \u201cbattle,\u201d where players have to have a \u201ckill or be killed\u201d mindset.\n\nWatch:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the heat of battle. Your mindset is kill or be killed. Because the offensive linemen are still coming at you. You\u2019re in war. You\u2019re supposed to be able to be violent sometimes and other times you\u2019re supposed to just be able to take your foot off the gas like that. That is hard, my friend.\u201d\n\nI feel for this guy. Do I think he should be fined? Yes. Do I think he should be kicked outta the league? No. I think it is absolutely dead wrong. This guy has handled himself like a pro. And yes, he is a violent mother f\u2019er and I love the way he plays the game of football.\u201d\n\nAs far as what punishment Romanowski believes the NFL should have given Burfict?\n\n\u201cI think a fine, maybe a game because there\u2019s previous stuff. Other people just get kicked out of the game. I\u2019ve been kicked out of games for things like that, so I get it. But, for him to be suspended for the season, I think is bulls**t.\u201d\n\nAs TMZ Sports reports, Burfict and Romanowski are friends. Burfict has been disciplined 13 times for illegal hits throughout his 8-year NFL career.Burfict is expected to appeal his suspension.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict's repeated illegal hits have certainly earned him his fair share of detractors.", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images_Scott-Halleran-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
