Beyond Meat, Shopify Fallout Is Latest Sign of Growth Reckoning\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The price that equity investors are willing to pay for fast growth is being tested again as slumps in Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: ) Inc. and Shopify Inc. show they\u2019re demanding more of companies with premium valuations.\n\nThe veggie-burger maker and e-commerce platform on Tuesday became the latest examples of firms that delivered on revenue-growth expectations only to see their stocks fall. Meanwhile, the food-delivery company GrubHub Inc. showed how damaging the fallout can be when that growth fades.\n\nShopify slid as much as 7.7% in Toronto despite boosting its revenue forecast for the year. The company reported an unexpected third-quarter loss after it increased spending to expand its customer network and build out fulfillment centers across the U.S. The stock was up 124% year to date through Monday\u2019s close and has a forward price-to-estimated sales ratio of 18, compared with an average of 1.6 for the S&P/TSX Composite Index.\n\nA higher sales forecast also proved insufficient for Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: ), which saw its shares tumble as much as 24% on concerns about competition and the expiration of a lockup for early investors. Beyond Meat shares are still up 240% since their initial public offering in May, but that\u2019s far from their 800% returns back in July. The stock trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 12, more than 6 times the average multiple for stocks in the S&P 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nGrubHub may provide a cautionary tale. Its shares plunged a record 44% after the food-delivery company gave a fourth-quarter outlook that was well below expectations, as intensifying competition and \u201cpromiscuous\u201d customers weighed on growth trends.", "description": "Beyond Meat, Shopify Fallout Is Latest Sign of Growth Reckoning", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC180BO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
