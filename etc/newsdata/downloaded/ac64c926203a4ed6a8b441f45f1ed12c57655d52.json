He revealed he has had to pull Farrell to one side to discuss how focusing too much on the captaincy has affected his performance but in the biggest selection call of his England tenure, Ford has been relegated to the bench.\n\nEngland lurch back to the future as Eddie Jones gambles on Owen Farrell | Robert Kitson Read more\n\nEngland go into the match on a six-game winning streak against Australia but this will be their first World Cup knockout match for eight years and of the XV Jones has chosen, only two players have experience of starting a World Cup quarter-final with Ben Youngs and Manu Tuilagi the only survivors from the last-eight defeat by France in 2011. \u201cIt\u2019s do-or-die time,\u201d said Jones. \u201cEvery time the samurais fought, one lived and one died. It will be the same on Saturday: someone is going to live and someone is going to die. That\u2019s what the game is about and that\u2019s the excitement of the game. You get the best eight teams, all playing for their lives.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about the World Cup is that every game is a knockout. No one has won a World Cup after losing a game and there\u2019s a reason for that. That\u2019s what I enjoy so much about a World Cup.\u201d\n\nAfter England\u2019s last match \u2013 the 39\u201110 victory over Argentina 12 days ago \u2013 the attack coach, Scott Wisemantel, revealed Farrell had described his own performance as clunky, having missed four consecutive kicks at goal in the first half. Ford, on the other hand, has been among the standout players of the World Cup and has outshone Farrell since Jones rekindled their 10-12 partnership over the summer. But in a move that echoes England\u2019s disastrous 2015 campaign, when Stuart Lancaster in effect made the same call for the defeat by Wales, Ford has been relegated to the bench with Farrell getting the nod for the No 10 jersey. As a result, Tuilagi switches to inside-centre with Henry Slade coming in for his first start of the tournament in the No 13 jersey.\n\nRugby World Cup\u2019s Battle of the Big Mouths: Eddie Jones v Michael Cheika | Simon Burnton Read more\n\n\u201c[Owen\u2019s] ability to delegate, to know what to say to players is a challenging experience for a young guy like him,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe\u2019s coping with it really well. I feel like sometimes, maybe earlier in the tournament, he spent too much time in the captaincy area and not enough on his own individual prep but I\u2019ve seen a real change in that this week.\n\n\u201cYou get all the family issues. You go to the dinner table, one brother is happy, one brother is unhappy. Someone doesn\u2019t know if they are happy or not. He\u2019s the father of that group, so to speak.\u201d\n\nFarrell has been picked at fly-half once in England\u2019s past six matches \u2013 the World Cup warm-up victory over Italy last month. The last time Tuilagi and Slade started outside him was the 38-38 draw with Scotland during this year\u2019s Six Nations, when England let a 31-7 lead slip. Farrell was replaced in the latter stages \u2013 by Ford, who scored the levelling try and conversion \u2013 a performance that raised questions over whether he was overburdened with too much responsibility.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got quite a big job for us,\u201d said Jones. \u201cHe\u2019s captain and he\u2019s goal-kicker. The responsibility of being captain at the World Cup is much larger than normal Test matches, because you\u2019re bringing a group of 31 players together for eight or nine weeks.\u201d\n\nAsked about Jones telling him he needed to focus more on his own performances, Farrell said: \u201cIt\u2019s just checking on me, making sure I am doing that, making sure that you\u2019re not getting caught up in other things and making sure it is about doing all you can to play your best at the weekend.\u201d\n\nAustralia have also made unexpected changes to their starting XV with the 19-year-old Jordan Petaia preferred at outside-centre to James O\u2019Connor. Petaia has won two caps, both on the wing, having made his debut against Uruguay less than two weeks ago, and Jones questioned how well the teenager will handle the occasion. He has previous for questioning opponents\u2019 ability to cope with pressure after claiming Wales would have doubts over Rhys Patchell before England\u2019s narrow Six Nations victory in 2018.\n\n\u201c[Petaia is] a handy player,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough of him to know he can play a bit, but it\u2019s going to be a big occasion for the boy. He\u2019s playing a quarter-final in front of 40,000 people in Oita where you know that you don\u2019t get another day. This is the day and for a young player you can either rise to the occasion or you can find it difficult, and I don\u2019t know his mindset but if Michael [Cheika] picks him then we\u2019d anticipate that he\u2019s ready to play.\u201d", "description": "The England coach has dropped George Ford and revealed he has had to talk to Owen Farrell to make sure captaincy does not continue to hurt his form", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a04e48503dea17a2d4fd9ba83cb4dc343b3968d2/0_127_2745_1646/master/2745.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dc40ef33f475e63c6e91b9e088e7f6c0", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
