And a late story about claims of accounting irregularities at Disney (DIS) seemed to spark an even wider selling into the close.\n\nI was impressed with the market breadth, especially with the NASDAQ, which saw 307 issues hit new 52-week lows last Thursday. That was the most since December 24, 2018, when 1,110 finished at their one-year low. Yesterday, 111 names finished at new highs against 65 new lows.\n\nDuring the session, big Chinese names enjoyed strong gains, including Sina (SINA) and Weibo (WB) Corporations. They were joined after the close when Baidu Inc (BIDU) posted monster results, and the shares initially popped at 15%.\n\nEating On The Run\n\nWe\u2019re a very busy nation that\u2019s always on the run, and that\u2019s helping to fuel impressive stock results for so-called fast-casual stocks. Old-school fast-food operator stocks are also doing very well.\n\nFast-Casual\n\nShake Shack (SHAK): +112%\n\nChipotle (CMG): +90%\n\nStarbucks (SBUX): +51%\n\nYum! Brands (YUM): +27\n\nWingstop (WING): +59%\n\nDunkin\u2019 Brands (DNKN): +28%\n\nFast-Food\n\nRestaurant Brands Int\u2019l (QSR): +43%\n\nWendy\u2019s (WEN): +31%\n\nYum! Brands (YUM): +27%\n\nThose restaurant chains where you wait for a server to take you to a table and peruse the menu aren\u2019t fairing as well. I still think investors should have exposure to the meteoric growth rate of fast-casual restaurants.\n\nNewsmakers?\n\nHome Depot (HD) at the Plate\n\nThis morning, all eyes will be on Home Depot, which is expected to announce revenue of $30.97 billion, and earnings per share of $3.08.\n\nOther key results from Kohl\u2019s (KSS) and T.J. Maxx (TJX) could give insight into the strength of the consumer.\n\nApproach\n\nWe increased our exposure to Technology (XLK) yesterday, lowering our cash levels.\n\nCommunication Services Consumer Discretionary Consumer Staples 1 2 1 Energy Financials Healthcare 1 1 2 Industrial Materials Real Estate 2 3 1 Technology Utilities Cash 2 0 4\n\nToday\u2019s Session\n\nThere is a lot of data out this morning, including several retailers. Here\u2019s my initial take with links back to the source information. The bottom line is there isn\u2019t evidence of a recession and everyone is ignoring deflation. I hope that doesn\u2019t include the Federal Reserve.\n\nBecause America is in Recession\n\nUS airlines expect record crowds over Labor Day weekend\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/20/us-airlines-expect-record-crowds-over-labor-day-we/\n\nThe trade group Airlines for America forecasted Tuesday that 17.5 million passengers will fly on U.S. carriers between Aug. 28 and Sept. 3. That\u2019s 2.5 million passengers a day and a 4% increase over the same week last year.\n\nThe busiest day is expected on Friday, Aug. 30, when the group forecasts just under 3 million people will board a U.S. airline.\n\nThe airline group says carriers have added seats even though Southwest, American and United have canceled thousands of flights while their Boeing 737 Max planes remain grounded.\n\nTransportation Department figures show that travel demand has been strong all year, with fares at or near record lows, after adjusting for inflation. The numbers don\u2019t include extra fees.\n\nDeflation Deepening\n\nHome Depot (HD)\n\nhttps://ir.homedepot.com/~/media/Files/H/HomeDepot-IR/reports-and-presentations/quarterly-earnings/2019/Q2/q2-2019-press-release.pdf\n\n\"We are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing from our strategic investments and believe that the current health of the U.S. consumer and a stable housing environment continue to support our business. That being said, lumber prices have declined significantly compared to last year, which impacts our sales growth. As a result, we are reaffirming our earnings-per-share growth guidance for fiscal 2019.\"\n\nLumber\n\nLast May, we heard from the National Association of Home Builders that tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber was adding $9,000 to the price of a typical new home and $3,000 to multifamily units. Right after that warning, lumber prices slipped into a deflationary death spiral and continues to struggle.\n\nLumber\n\nGaining momentum\n\nKohl\u2019s (KSS)\n\nhttps://corporate.kohls.com/news/archive-/2019/august/kohl-s-corporation-reports-financial-results\n\nMichelle Gass, Kohl's chief executive officer, said, \"We are pleased to report that our business strengthened as we progressed through the second quarter. Comparable sales were better than the first quarter and improved during the period, turning positive during the last six weeks of the second quarter with 1% growth.\n\nThis positive trend has continued into August driven by a successful start to the back-to-school season. We are confident that our upcoming brand launches, program expansions, and increased traffic from the Amazon returns program will incrementally contribute to our performance during the balance of the year and beyond.\u201d\n\nSummation\n\nMajor indices haven\u2019t taken out key resistance points, and there are still lots of questions as well as the September 1st tariffs.\n\nI continue to say don\u2019t panic.", "description": "Yesterday was a good session, but once again, the market .09/02/2019 3:25:24AM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/305/76105473-2de5-44a2-b1d1-c1b10b6c6076.jpg"}
