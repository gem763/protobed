But others see the removal of U.S. troops in Syria as a fulfillment of one of Trump\u2019s main campaign promises: \u201cto get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham said the president's decision to remove troops from Syria is \u201ca disaster in the making.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know all the details regarding President Trump\u2019s decision in northern Syria. In process of setting up phone call with Secretary Pompeo.\n\n\n\nIf press reports are accurate this is a disaster in the making. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\nBut Dr. Sebastian Gorka, host of the National Salem Radio Show \"America First\", defended the Trump administration's decision to withdrawal troops and accused the Democrats \"and NeverTrump neocons\" of wanting to start another war.\n\nYes. That\u2019s what @TheDemocrats and NeverTrump neocons want.\n\n\n\nAnother war. https://t.co/ns2QJiyb7W \u2014 Sebastian Gorka DrG (@SebGorka) October 16, 2019\n\nAt last night's CNN debate, most of the Democrat candidates criticized the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, as Laura Ingraham noted.\n\nEureka! All the Democrats on stage except @TulsiGabbard agree with @LindseyGrahamSC on Syria. #warparty \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) October 16, 2019\n\nAnd Buck Sexton corrected Democrat candidate Pete Buttigieg's slander of President Trump, pointing out that \"500,000 people died in Syria *while Obama was president*.\"\n\nButtigieg claiming that the \u201cslaughter going on in Syria\u201d is Trump\u2019s fault is preposterous overstatement and ignores the realities of the Syrian civil war\n\n\n\n500,000 people died in Syria *while Obama was president* \u2014 Buck Sexton (@BuckSexton) October 16, 2019\n\nAnn Coulter has criticized the Trump administration for not doing enough to fulfill other campaign promises, like repealing the DACA amnesty, deporting illegal aliens, and building a big, beautiful wall. But Coulter came to the president's defense last night, pointing out the Syrian withdrawal announces to the our allies that they \"can no longer count on America . . .to fight their wars, pay their bills, and protect their borders but not our own.\n\nTrump's critics are right, he's showing our allies they can no longer count on America. . . .to fight their wars, pay their bills, and protect their borders but not our own. \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) October 16, 2019\n\n\"Outrage over Trump's Syria decision shows Washington's perverse priorities,\" Tucker Carlson said on Fox News. \"For once, Americans are coming home from a Middle Eastern tar pit, rather than staying forever, and we ought to be celebrating that. Across the country people are. But in Washington, people are apoplectic. They're telling us we're not allowed to leave Syria. It's immoral, they say. It's a betrayal. Not a betrayal of Americans - that wouldn't be a problem here in Washington. It happens here every day.\"", "description": "President Trumps decision to remove U.S. troops from Syria has been criticized by members of his own party. .10/16/2019 16:40:27PM EST.", "authors": ["Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/72/3a3aded7-0564-4a50-98a8-fe5303555d62.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
