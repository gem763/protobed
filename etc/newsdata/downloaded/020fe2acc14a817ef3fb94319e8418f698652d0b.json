As well as using moisturisers like Lidl\u2019s range, there are a few things you can do to help this.\n\nFor a start, using an air humidifier in your home can make a difference, as can taking extra care to stay hydrated (as tempting as it can be to hibernate with a glass of wine during the winter months \u2013 this doesn\u2019t help) and avoiding harsh toners.\n\nMORE: Bride uses dad's ashes for her wedding day nails\n\nMORE: Harrods has just opened a massive new beauty emporium\n\nMORE: Stunning photos show men\u2019s beauty pageant contestants decked out in national dress\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Supermarket Lidl is launching a range of skincare products which use the ingredient hyaluronic acid.", "authors": ["James Greig"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88794312_1570437656.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
