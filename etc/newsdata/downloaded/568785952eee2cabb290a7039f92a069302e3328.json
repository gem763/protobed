BROWN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe 2019 Emmys are here, which means only one thing: Hot Girl Summer is over, and Hot Girl Awards Season is well underway. The Television Academy has planned a broadcast that\u2019s the host-less with the, uh, most-less \u2026 leaving plenty of time to present 27 categories. In case you missed them, last week\u2019s Creative Arts Emmy recipients ranged from Lawful Good (Norman Lear! Rachel Bloom!) to Chaotic Evil (Rent \u201cLive\u201d won a Production Design Emmy over Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Homecoming for, what? Scaffolding?) Tonight\u2019s nominees include a strong HBO showing due to the final seasons of Veep and Game of Thrones, and a general love of Bill Hader. It also features an Outstanding Comedy Actress group that may be the strongest lineup of nominees for anything in any awards show in recent memory. All of the winners are listed below, so you can see if your favorite television show of 2019 won. Providing it aired before June. Or sometime in the back half of 2018.
