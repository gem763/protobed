Time is invaluable where he can sit back and learn from quarterbacks like Case and Colt [McCoy] as well as players like Alex [Smith]. It is a fine line. We are trying to win games still. Our dynamic is tough and it is challenging.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCallahan said Keenum is going through concussion protocol and his status remains uncertain. The Redskins are afforded extra time to get ready for the Buffalo Bills next week by virtue of playing Thursday night, so Callahan hadn\u2019t yet put together a practice plan for Haskins with Keenum\u2019s availability a question.\n\nRegardless, the coach pointed to several areas where Haskins needs to improvethat revealed themselves in the loss \u2014 situational awareness, fundamentals, play clock management and getting in and out of the huddle quicker. Callahan pointed to Hall of Famer Steve Young and Green Bay Packers star Aaron Rodgers as examples of rookies who sat multiple years before being named the starter. He also noted that Troy Aikman and Peyton Manning, another pair of Hall of Famers, endured struggles early in their careers.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have some growing pains with young quarterbacks and we get that,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything in our power to generate a positive result for Dwayne whether it\u2019s in the classroom or on the field. We\u2019ve done extra work with him and he\u2019s done extra work. We\u2019re doing everything possible to generate some better execution out of his game that will translate into a win.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHaskins was visibly sullen following Thursday\u2019s game and spoke softly during his news conference. Callahan, however, isn\u2019t worried about his body language and said that\u2019s something that will improve as he matures.\n\n\u201cA lot of people wear their emotions on their sleeves,\u201d Callahan said, \u201cand Dwayne is one of those guys because he takes it to heart, he cares. \u2026 He doesn\u2019t want to let anybody down.\u201d\n\nFans have clamored to see more of Haskins as the season continues to spiral. Keenum hasn\u2019t played particularly well in his past four games and there\u2019s a belief that Haskins needs to develop against other teams rather than watching.\n\nCallahan said Haskins\u2019s development, however, is not the only concern.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe priority is developing our entire team,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cNot just one player but our entire team. A focal point is to improve the team and make the team better. If Dwayne\u2019s a part of that formula, great. And if he\u2019s not, we have a plan. We definitely want everybody on this team to improve, just not one position but everybody. Everybody\u2019s got to get better. Everybody\u2019s rate of improvement has got to show a different metric than what it\u2019s been and get more production out of a lot of different areas.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA Williams return?\n\nAn NFL Network report surfaced Thursday that tackle Trent Williams is considering ending his holdout for Week 10, but Callahan said he hasn\u2019t been involved with the stalemate between the team and Williams. \u2026\n\nAD\n\nCallahan said he is hopeful that running back Chris Thompson (toe) will return this week and said fellow rusher Derrius Guice (knee) may start practicing this week. Vernon Davis remains in the concussion protocol and Callahan didn\u2019t have new information on Quinton Dunbar (hamstring), who was hurt against the Vikings.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nAD", "description": "Redskins interim head coach says the rookie is not ready to be the starter and the team is still trying to win games.", "authors": ["Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qO4j4iVh-bg7atrynTPN5OcqpsI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q3SKDAHW2YI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
