We also asked the Saudis and the estate if Epstein and MBS personally knew each other.\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon declined to answer detailed questions sent via email.\n\nAn unnamed spokesperson for the Center for International Communication, a state-owned agency that coordinates media coverage of the Saudi government, said they would pass our questions to the \u201cproper entities.\u201d We did not receive a response by presstime.\n\nEpstein\u2019s attorney, Reid Weingarten, did not acknowledge requests for comment.", "description": "", "authors": ["J.K.
