Noah mischaracterized West\u2019s comments by ignoring the Grammy-winner\u2019s main claim that expecting blacks to only vote for Democrats simply because they are black is a racist assumption.\n\nDuring one of Noah\u2019s off-air segments of his Daily Show program, Noah railed against West for saying \u201cevery black person in America is brainwashed.\u201d That isn\u2019t exactly what West said in the interview Noah cited.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t disagree that you can have your own opinion,\u201d Noah said of West\u2019s comments. \u201cBut this is what I don\u2019t like, is when Kanye West and people like him will say, \u2018Black people in America have been brainwashed\u2026 into voting for the Democrats, believing that they\u2019re victims, but we\u2019re not victims! We can vote Republican! We can do whatever we want!\u2019 Then I\u2019m like, OK, let me get this straight: you\u2019re saying that every black person in America is brainwashed? You\u2019re saying that 70, 80, 90 percent of black people who are voting Democrat, they\u2019re brainwashed? So you\u2019re saying you\u2019re the only person who\u2019s enlightened, and all these black people are stupidly following this Democratic victim [narrative]?\u201d\n\nKanye West did not actually say \u201cevery black person in America is brainwashed.\u201d\n\nIn his October 25 interview with radio host Big Boy, West said, \u201cBro, we brainwashed out here bro. C\u2019mon man, this is a free man talking. Democrats had us voting Democrats on food stamps for years bro.\u201d\n\nThat is not exactly the same as saying \u201call\u201d black people are brainwashed but is instead West generalizing.\n\nIn the interview, West continued saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s you\u2019re talking about? Guns in the \u201980s, taking the fathers out the homes, plan B, lowering our votes, making us abort our children. Thou shall not kill.\u201d\n\n\u201cBro, we brainwashed out here. Come on\u2026this a free man talking. Democrats had us voting Democrat for years\u2026. taking the fathers out of the home, Plan B, lowering our votes, making us abort our children. Gosh they're now killed.\u201d @kanyewest pic.twitter.com/tIhR6iruBz \u2014 Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) October 26, 2019\n\nOn Tuesday, Trevor Noah went on to rip West for saying that blacks should not reflexively vote for Democrats simply because they are blacks, and that is what blacks are expected to do. Indeed, as far as the comedy TV host is concerned, Democrats give blacks \u201cthe best chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is more likely? The fact that these people are brainwashed, or the fact that, in America, you have to vote for the system that gives you the best chance? You only have two choices, and that does make it weird, but you only have to choices, and if you are a black person you go, well, I\u2019m going to vote for the choice that gives me the best chance of success,\u201d said Noah, adding, \u201cYou get to a point, and it\u2019s true, when you are famous and rich enough as a black person where it\u2019s like, yeah, your life isn\u2019t affected the same way by Republican policies. In fact, it may even be beneficial for you as a rich person to vote Republican because they\u2019re like \u2018less taxes,\u2019 and you\u2019re like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll take that.\u2019\u201d \u201cYou know who doesn\u2019t mess around with their votes in America? Black women. They don\u2019t. They do not. And I refuse to live in a world where I go, \u2018Black women have been brainwashed.\u2019 No, I don\u2019t think black women in America have been\u2014or can be\u2014brainwashed. I think, if anything, black women in America have the least leeway when it comes to messing around with their vote,\u201d said Trevor Noah. \u201cBlack women in America are like, no, I know where my vote needs to go because I know how important this is to me, because, as a woman and as a black person combined, the impacts of my vote are exponentially felt. I have a higher rate of mortality when I\u2019m giving birth, I have a higher chance of not getting a loan, I have a higher chance of not getting a job, I will get exponentially less for doing the same job as somebody else. As a black woman, I cannot afford to mess around with this vote. That, to me, is not a brainwashed person. That\u2019s not a victim.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as West noted, Democrats continue to push for abortion on demand, for any reason, and all the way up until birth despite that abortion has by some estimates killed off 14 million black Americans since 1973 when Roe v Wade was decided in the U.S. Supreme Court. But it gets no better for black children lucky enough to escape abortions as the big, Democrat-controlled cities have failed to educate black children. Democrat-controlled cities have some of the worst school systems in the nation, and few of these cities have any Republicans to blame whatsoever. Blacks also suffer rampant income inequality in those same big, Democrat-led cities.\n\nAll this factors into West\u2019s main point that the Democrat Party has failed to lift blacks up out of the lowest tiers in nearly every category, despite Noah\u2019s rant. Kanye West has repeatedly said that the Democrat Party has in no way earned the near universal support among black voters it now receives.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Comedy Central host Trevor Noah slammed Kanye West for his criticism of failed and destructive Democrat Party politics.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/trevornoah1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
