They've tallied three yellow cards in their last two games.\n\nThere were milestones for two veteran forwards.\n\nLock Rob Simmons became the 11th Wallabies Test centurion when he came off the bench while it was the 75th and final Test for Gorgodze, regarded as on of the finest tier two forwards in the game.\n\nAustralia ran into a Gorgodze-inspired Georgian brick wall throughout the first quarter and suffered a casualty when Beale was forced off when copping an accidental knee to the head from David Kacharava in the 13th minute.\n\nThe dazed fullback didn't return and must be in doubt for next week's quarter-final, probably against England,.\n\nThe scoring began 10 minutes later when halfback Nic White darted over following waves of Wallabies attacks.\n\nFive-eighth Matt To'omua landed the conversion on the way to a three-from-five return with the boot.\n\nTo'omua emerged as one of Australia's better performers, mounting pressure on coach Michael Cheika to start him at No.10 in the knockout games.", "description": "Marika Koroibete's sizzling solo try stole the show but the Wallabies otherwise battled to see off Georgia 27-8 in their final Rugby World Cup pool match in...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
