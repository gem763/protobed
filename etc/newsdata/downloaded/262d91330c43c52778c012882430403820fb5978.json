A debate Tuesday night in Ohio among the biggest group of Democrats yet was notable for attacks directed at the new perceived frontrunner, the emergence of some fresh issues and the playing of some greatest hits (read: healthcare). Here are the key takeaways:\n\nElizabeth Warren attacked in new role as frontrunner\n\nIn earlier debates, the former vice-president Joe Biden was the candidate to scrap with for lesser-known candidates who wanted to make a splash. In Ohio, that torch passed to the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who has popped to the top of some recent polls. Whether the topic was healthcare or wealth inequality, the Democratic field turned their answers into challenges to Warren, who ended the night with a lion\u2019s share of the speaking time.\n\nTwelve Democrats face off in largest primary debate in US history Read more\n\nEarly in the debate, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, attacked Warren over what he said were the hidden costs of her plan for Medicare for All. \u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything \u2013 except this,\u201d Buttigieg said, accusing Warren\u2019s healthcare policy of having a \u201cmultitrillion-dollar hole\u201d.\n\nThe Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar piled on: \u201cWe want a plan, not a pipe dream.\u201d\n\nThe California senator Kamala Harris tried to get Warren to say Donald Trump should be kicked off Twitter, while former representative Beto O\u2019Rourke attacked Warren on her wealth tax proposal: \u201cSometimes I feel that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive, or pitting some part of the country against the other, instead of lifting people up.\u201d\n\nBut Warren appeared to handle the fire well, saying she backed policies, not punishment. \u201cI understand that this is hard,\u201d she replied on healthcare. \u201cWe are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard.\u201d\n\nA unified chorus on impeachment (almost)\n\nThe debate began with a chorus call for the president\u2019s impeachment, with the candidates taking turns articulating why they thought the president had betrayed the public trust and why Democrats in Congress must forge ahead.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over again without consequences,\u201d Warren said.\n\n\u201cOur Framers imagined this moment, a moment when we would have a corrupt president,\u201d said Harris. \u201cThis is one of those moments and Congress must act.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar slammed Trump for what she said was the sale of US foreign policy to the highest bidder. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make America great again, it makes Russia great again, and that\u2019s what this president has done,\u201d Klobuchar said.\n\n\u201cHe should be removed,\u201d said the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro.\n\nThe only minor note of dissent was sounded by the Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard, who is polling at less than 1% nationally: \u201cIf impeachment is driven by these hyper-partisan interests, it will only further divide us,\u201d she said.\n\nThe (elderly) elephant in the room\n\nAll three leading Democratic candidates \u2013 Biden, Warren and Bernie Sanders \u2013 are in their 70s, and the question of whether they are too old to take up the presidency was made explicit for the first time on Tuesday night.\n\nWarren, 71, had the sharpest answer: \u201cI say I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans get stuck with,\u201d she said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Elizabeth Warren held her own against plenty of heat from fellow debaters at Tuesday night.

But he concluded by thanking people across the country who offered wishes for his recovery.\n\n\u201cI just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I\u2019m so happy to be with you this evening,\u201d he said.\n\nWhere does that leave Biden?\n\nFor the entirety of the campaign, the former vice-president has led in most polls. That hasn\u2019t changed despite seeming stumbles in previous debates \u2013 stumbles visible again in Ohio, with Biden saying at one point: \u201cI would eliminate the capital gains tax. Uh, I would raise the capital gains tax, to the highest rate of 39.6%. I would double it.\u201d\n\nThe rule for Biden so far has been that such gaffes are irrelevant; so long as he seems his familiar self, he can hold his lead. And on Tuesday night he had some inspired moments, especially on foreign policy.\n\n\u201cWe have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates only [to advance] his own re-election,\u201d Biden said. He warned that if Trump were re-elected, \u201cI promise you there will be no Nato,\u201d and he said: \u201cWe have Isis that\u2019s going to come here. They are going to damage the USA.\u201d\n\nBiden also defended his son Hunter Biden, whose five-year membership on the board of directors of a gas company in Ukraine has become the centerpiece of Trump\u2019s re-election strategy.\n\n\u201cMy son did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the US government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAbortion takes the stage\n\nAfter four debates in which the Republican attack on reproductive rights received next to no airtime, the candidates in Ohio were eager to send up a rallying cry on the issue.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s access to reproductive healthcare \u2026 is under attack,\u201d said Harris, leading the charge. \u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say that women will die \u2013 poor women, women of color, because of these Republican legislators \u2026 [who] are telling women what to do with our bodies.\n\n\u201cPeople need to keep their hands off of women\u2019s bodies and let them choose.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kamala Harris and other tackled women\u2019s healthcare and abortion rights.

While reproductive rights received the first real attention of the cycle on the Ohio stage, there was no substantive discussion of the climate crisis, while other issues of central concern to voters \u2013 housing costs, childcare, voting rights, agricultural pollution and crumbling infrastructure \u2013 were no-shows.\n\nThe one-liner competition\n\nWith so many candidates on stage, the contenders all came with a quiver of one-liners (with the exception, notably, of the big three: Warren, Biden and Sanders) meant to help them break through. Klobuchar was a standout.\n\nHere\u2019s a roundup of the sharpest quips:\n\nKlobuchar, attacking Warren on healthcare: \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nCastro: \u201cThis president is caging kids on the border, and effectively letting Isis prisoners run free.\u201d\n\nBooker: \u201cThis president is turning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar, on Trump\u2019s Syria policy: \u201cOur president blew it and now he\u2019s too proud to say it.\u201d\n\nHarris, on drug company executives: \u201cThey are nothing more than some high-level dope dealers.\u201d\n\nSteyer: \u201cTrump\u2019s America First program \u2026 involves having no plans, having no process and having no partners.\u201d", "description": "The candidates addressed age and experience \u2013 but hardly discussed climate \u2013 as they showcased their best quips", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f3b640126e46cf126a7d6cfd41ceb1f4576c231/0_0_4830_2897/master/4830.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=439ec9f56d1f82b9f71b67c0cda4a0dc", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
