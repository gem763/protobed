While already Roku offers distinct versions of some of its streaming media players exclusively for retailers like Walmart and Best Buy, the company had briefly mentioned a larger deal with Walmart in its second-quarter financial report.\n\nIn addition to the Roku TVs and players sold at Walmart, Roku had said it would offer \u201cseveral new Roku devices including audio products,\u201d under the Walmart onn brand.\n\nThe new onn Roku audio devices for Walnart are an expansion of the line introduced last month.\n\nIn September, Roku debuted two new devices including the Smart Soundbar and Wireless Subwoofer, both at $180 each. The idea was to complement the existing Roku wireless speakers, in the case of the subwoofer, or offer an alternative for those who didn\u2019t own a Roku TV or didn\u2019t have enough space to set up the wireless speakers, in the case of the soundbar.\n\nThe Walmart onn-branded Smart Soundbar and Wireless Subwoofer, meanwhile, will only cost $129 each.\n\nSimilar to Roku\u2019s flagship models, onn Roku Smart Soundbar offers support for Dolby Audio, streaming from Bluetooth devices, and connects to the TV via HDMI-ARC or HDMI and Optical. However, it will ship with Roku\u2019s simpler IR remote offering TV power and channel button shortcuts, instead of the more powerful voice remote that comes with the $180 version.\n\nIt also features 40W of peak power versus the Roku Smart Soundbar\u2019s 60W and different drivers.\n\nThe onn Roku Wireless Subwoofer is designed to work with the onn Roku Smart Sounbar to offer customers a deeper, richer bass. The lower-cost version features a 10\u2033 driver like the Roku Wireless Subwoofer, but it\u2019s slightly smaller and features 150 peak watts of power versus the Roku Wireless Subwoofer\u2019s 250 peak watts of power.\n\nBoth devices also feature branding and cosmetic differences, Roku says.\n\n\u201cRoku and Walmart have worked together for years to enhance the entertainment experience for millions of people who have purchased Roku TV models and Roku streaming players. Now, we\u2019re looking forward to getting these new audio products on shelves to provide consumers with better sound for their TV experience at a great price,\u201d said Mark Ely, Vice President of Players and Whole Home Product Management at Roku, in a statement.\n\nThe Walmart exclusivity deal will help to bring more customers to Roku\u2019s products at a time when the majority of Roku\u2019s revenue isn\u2019t hardware sales, but rather platform revenue.\n\nLed by advertising, Roku platform revenue has out-earned hardware sales for the past five quarters. And in Q2, Roku saw $250.1 million in revenue versus $224.4 million expected, up 59% from the same quarter in 2018 \u2014 the rise largely attributed to advertising.\n\nThe new onn Roku-branded products may serve as an entry point for some customers into Roku\u2019s wider range of products, including its streaming players and Roku OS-powered TVs, for example. This, in turn, could help Roku grow its customer base for its platform business. In addition, Walmart shoppers are historically price-conscious, meaning they\u2019re the ideal demographic to target with Roku\u2019s growing ad-supported streaming business, where it provides free movies and TV through its home page hub, The Roku Channel.\n\nThe devices will become available sometime in the next few weeks both in Walmart stores and on Walmart.com, says Roku.", "description": "Roku will produce lower-cost versions of its new Smart Soundbar and Wireless Subwoofer for Walmart under the retailer\u2019s own onn brand, the company announced this morning.
