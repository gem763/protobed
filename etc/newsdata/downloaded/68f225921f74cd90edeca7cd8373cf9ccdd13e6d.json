Now, he hosts lectures and classes in sake as well as on Japanese food preparations like pickling.\n\nThe intimate, 22-seat Sakai Bar is a great place to learn about and sample different sakes.\n\nBates started spending time there with his friend Sakai, and it wasn't long before sakes began working their way onto both the food and drink menus at Grey Gardens.\n\n\"In my kitchen now, sake makes its way in the flavor profiles,\" Bates explains. \"It just naturally flows into the food that I'm making.\"\n\nOne of the Grey Gardens dishes that highlights sake is a kale and littleneck clam broth with grilled rice, chanterelle mushrooms and onions.\n\nFor Bates, the dish was a no-brainer, as seafood was a great canvas for showing off the salinity of sake.\n\nRelated content The secret ingredient in Vietnam's most indulgent bowl of pho\n\nAnd when it comes to pairings?

After all, if you're going to try something new, you might as well do it deliciously.\n\nGrey Gardens , 199 Augusta Ave Toronto, Canada +1 (647) 351-1552", "description": "For some chefs, owning and operating a successful restaurant is achievement enough.
