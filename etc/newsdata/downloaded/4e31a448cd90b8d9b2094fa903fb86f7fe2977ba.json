'They had no idea they were even in the United States. They were just trying to get back to their hotel.'\n\nCambria said it's likely the family will be formally deported, but no paperwork has been shared with them or their lawyers.\n\nU.K. citizens David Connors, 30, and Eileen Connors, 24, have been detained at Berks Detention Center in Pennsylvania with their three-month-old son\n\nAlso detained is David's brother Michael Connor, one other women and two-year-old twin girls\n\nThe family was taken into custody near the US- Vancouver border for the first night and were told they would be released to family in the U.S., though they said all they wanted to do was go home.\n\nAccording to Eileen Connors' statement, immigration officials said there was a change in plans and instead of being released to family, they were put in a van and driven to the airport.\n\nEileen said it was 'like an abduction or kidnapping'.\n\n'We will be traumatized for the rest of our lives by what the United States government has done to us,' Eileen Connors wrote in a statement obtained by The Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nWhen they got to the Seattle airport, Eileen said she thought they were finally going home but instead they were flown to Pennsylvania and arrived at the Berks center on October 5.\n\nBerks is one of three detention centers for migrant families the U.S., while the other two are in Texas near the Mexico border.\n\nThe men were separated in a different part of the center, while Eileen opted to keep her son with her instead of separated with other children.\n\nEileen said her son was stripped naked and exposed with his clothes and blankets taken for washing.\n\n'When I ask how am I supposed to keep my baby warm in this horrible cold, all they tell me is to put a hat on him\u2026 They even took away one of his formula containers, which I had to beg for three days for them to return it to me,' she wrote.\n\nThe family were driving near the Canada-U.S. border on October 3 when Michael swerved onto an unmarked road to avoid hitting an animal (pictured is a border crossing between Canada and the U.S.)\n\nEileen wrote that the blankets and sheets they were given 'smelled like a dead dog'.\n\nShe said she won't use them to cover her son 'for fear they haven't been washed and my baby will become sick.'\n\nShe added that the bathrooms are dirty and broken and at night a staff shines flashlight into their cell every 15 minutes.\n\n'I feel like someone is going to take my baby,' she said.\n\nOfficials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told The Philadelphia Inquirer that they were checking into the case and would respond to a request for comment as soon as possible.\n\n'We have been treated like criminals here, stripped of our rights, and lied to. It is not right,' Eileen wrote. 'We have been traumatized. This would never happen in the United Kingdom to U.S. citizens, or anyone else, because people there are treated with dignity.'\n\nA family source told DailyMail.com Eileen had been trying to conceive for more than five years before their son was born. The family said it is heartbreaking for them.", "description": "U.K. citizens David Connors, 30, and Eileen Connors, 24, have been detained in\u00a0Pennsylvania with their three-month-old son, David's brother, one other women and two-year-old twin girls.", "authors": ["Kayla Brantley For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/23/19713456-0-image-a-26_1571091478944.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
