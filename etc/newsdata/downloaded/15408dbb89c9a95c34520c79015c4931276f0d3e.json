Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Belinda Bencic reached her first-ever Grand Slam semi-final on Wednesday, fending off Donna Vekic to win 7-6(5) 6-3 in their U.S. Open last-eight clash on Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nThe pair appeared evenly matched through most of the first set, as Switzerland\u2019s Bencic struggled for consistency on serve, firing off five aces but committing four double faults.\n\nThe 13th seed took command of the match in the second set, committing just four unforced errors compared to 17 in the first.\n\nCroatian Vekic fired 28 winners during the match but failed to save critical break points against her, as an elated Bencic reached a new milestone in an injury-plagued career.\n\n\u201cSometimes you all take it a little bit for granted,\u201d said the 22-year-old, who stunned world number one and defending champion Naomi Osaka earlier in the week. \u201cWhen you can\u2019t play you miss it so much.\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s a perspective change and I am enjoying playing tennis so much now.\u201d\n\nBencic next plays either Canada\u2019s Bianca Andreescu or Belgium\u2019s Elise Mertens, who face off under the lights at Arthur Ashe Stadium later on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cFor sure Andreescu has a lot of variation in her game. Mertens is more like a wall-type of game. She\u2019s a great counter-puncher,\u201d said Bencic.\n\n\u201cDefinitely I\u2019m very curious who is going to win and adapt to the opponent in the semi-finals.\u201d", "description": "Belinda Bencic reached her first-ever Grand Slam semi-final on Wednesday, fending off Donna Vekic to win 7-6(5) 6-3 in their U.S. Open last-eight clash on Arthur Ashe Stadium.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426263734&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF83247"}
