Undeniably there are fewer GP appointments so there\u2019s a cost attached to that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe study found 95 per cent of people who started out with low mental well-being improved in six weeks after working in nature for five to six hours each week.\n\nThe report has led to calls for more investment so that nature-based services can become more widespread.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He chased the mother, then seized the calf in his huge gape, clearly intent on killingit. After trying to drown it, he tried to crush it to death. All the while, the distraught mother looked on. Infanticide among hippos is rare but may result from the stress caused through overcrowding when their day-resting pools dry out.

It\u2019s also important to have more investment in Wildlife Trust outdoor volunteering which has been proven to improve mental, physical and social wellbeing.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we need many more wild, natural places near to where people live and work. That way, green prescribing can be rolled-out everywhere\n\n\u201cThis would help the NHS save money, as well as help nature to recover.\u201d\n\nAnne-Marie Bagnall, professor of health and wellbeing evidence at Leeds Beckett University, said: \u201cThe significant return on investment of conservation activities in nature means that they should be encouraged as part of psychological wellbeing interventions.\u201d\n\nDr Amir Khan, a GP and health ambassador for The Wildlife Trusts said there is a clear need to invest in nature-based services.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf more people could access nature programmes, I believe that we would see a knock-on effect in our GP surgeries, with fewer people attending for help with preventable or social problems arising from being cut off from others, not getting active or having a purpose.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "Prescribing contact with nature to people with poor mental health could save nearly \u00a37 for every \u00a31 invested in projects, new research has found. \u00a0 People experiencing problems, such as anxiety, stress and depression, reported feeling significantly better, both emotionally and physically, after taking part in outdoor nature conservation projects, according to research by Leeds", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/09/11/istock-1051781280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
