UAW leaders have expressed concern about the impact of EVs on their members.\n\nGM also did little to lower its share of the UAW's healthcare plans, which could be more costly to Ford since it employs about 55,000 UAW members in the United States.\n\nThe UAW had previously agreed to a temporary contract extension with Ford while it focused on GM.\n\nWhile the talks between GM and the UAW grew tense at times, with the union accusing the auto maker of trying to \"starve ... workers off the picket lines\", Ford historically has had an easier relationship with the union.\n\nFord executive chairman Bill Ford has described the UAW as \"family\" in the past and in September 2018 hailed the No. 2 US auto maker's relationship with its hourly workers.\n\n\"The UAW doesn't just make our workers better, it makes Ford better and stronger,\" Bill Ford told UAW workers last year.\n\nWorkers at GM will begin to go back as early as Saturday under the new four-year contract, ending the strike that cost the No. 1 US auto maker more than $US2 billion (about $3 billion) and costing the auto maker about 300,000 units of lost production. GM will attempt to make up some of that production in the coming months.\n\nThe union wrung higher pay and other benefits from GM as part of the deal to end the strike by about 48,000 workers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUAW leaders had recommended that the members at GM, who have remained on the picket lines, ratify the deal reached on October 16.\n\nThe GM strike began on September 16, with UAW negotiators seeking higher pay for workers, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits.\n\nOther issues included the fate of plants GM targeted to close, as well as the use of lower-paid temporary workers.\n\nThe strike at GM likely slashed at least 46,000 jobs from October's nonfarm US payrolls, the Labor Department said on Friday.\n\nUnder the deal, GM will invest $US9 billion in the United States, including $US7.7 directly in its plants, with the rest going to joint ventures.\n\nThe Detroit company said it will also create or retain 9000 UAW jobs, a substantial portion of which will be new, a source previously said. The contract offers $US11,000 signing bonuses to members, and pay raises.\n\nThe UAW previously agreed to temporary contract extensions with Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles while it focused on GM.\n\nReuters", "description": "Unionised workers at GM voted 57 per cent to approve a deal to end a contentious 40-day US strike, the longest automotive labour stoppage since 1970.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_140/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/783e544da8caaed3437ab667fd510ea35d2067c7", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
