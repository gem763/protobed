He called on his organization's 100,000 members to immediately resume teaching pupils in around 4,000 public schools that had been affected by the strike.\n\nMany parents had kept their children at home out of solidarity with the striking teachers.\n\nIn many of the country's rural areas and smaller cities, traditional heartlands of support for the monarchy, the strike also became a protest against successive governments' failure to deliver on promises of economic growth.\n\nGrowing disenchantment among ordinary Jordanians over tough IMF austerity measures and high taxes spilled into large street protests in the summer of 2018 that railed against corruption and mismanagement of public funds.\n\nOfficials say Jordan can no longer afford to sustain a public sector in which salaries eat up much of the central government's $13 billion budget in a country with some of the world's highest government spending relative to its economy.\n\nThe debt is due, at least in part, to the adoption by successive governments of an expansionist fiscal policy marked by job creation in the public sector.
