I'm not surprised they have gone well - they have some belief.\n\n'From what I believe, they have had a fair bit of time together to prepare for this World Cup.\n\nJapan's victory over Scotland to book their place in the quarter-finals was hugely momentous\n\n'They play to their strengths and that is fast, moving the ball into space. But they can also carry, are good at the breakdown, slowing it down and kicking at the right time.\n\n'Teams try to maximise their strengths - whatever they believe they are - and that makes them no different to us.\n\n'When we played them at Twickenham in November they were pretty good, especially the first 40 minutes.'\n\nJapan survived a late fightback by Scotland to secure their place among the World Cup elite in a match that was under threat of being cancelled due to Super Typhoon Hagibis.\n\n'I thought it was a brilliant game, it lived up to the hype. I was really impressed with how controlled and accurate they were,' Ford said.\n\n'You could see how the momentum shifted between the teams throughout the game, with each team getting on top.'\n\nJapan coach Jamie Joseph - who succeeded Eddie Jones - and his assistant Tony Brown spent time with England during this year's Six Nations.\n\n'It was great to have them in, watching what we do then having discussions with them. They have a different way of looking at things and a different approach,' England scrum coach Neal Hatley said.\n\nYu Tamura (top) congratulates Keita Inagaki after he scored Japan's second try of the game\n\n'It's about what suits your team and players. We do things differently. It's like getting to 10 - you can do five plus five or seven plus three. They go seven plus three, we might go differently.\n\n'You can't help but be enthralled at the speed of their game, but it also suits the players they've got.\n\n'I also sometimes like five five-metre scrums in a row and line-outs. The beauty of our game is that it involves all sorts.'\n\nJapan now face a quarter-final against South Africa, who they famously beat four years ago\n\nEngland travel to Oita on Monday where they will step up preparations for their quarter-final against Australia, a team they have beaten six times in a row.\n\nNumber eight Billy Vunipola (ankle) and wing Jack Nowell (hamstring) remain doubts for the last eight showdown after sustaining injuries against Argentina nine days ago.\n\n'Our record against Australia is irrelevant. Completely irrelevant. What has gone on in the past doesn't matter,' Ford said.\n\n'It is all about this week, all about the game on Saturday, we will make sure we are ready.'", "description": "The hosts have toppled heavyweights Ireland and Scotland en route to setting up an historical first appearance in the quarter-finals where they face South Africa at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.", "authors": ["Duncan Bech", "Pa England Rugcorrespondent"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/15/19664110-0-image-a-47_1571062402497.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
