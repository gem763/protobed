But then again, perhaps all weddings are fundamentally unreasonable\n\nWould you go to a 5.30am wedding? This is the question on people\u2019s lips after a Reddit user revealed that this is exactly what they were planning for their nuptials. \u201cEvery year on our anniversary, my fiance and I wake up early, go to the beach and watch the sunrise together,\u201d they wrote, adding that the tradition meant enough to them to form the basis of their marriage ceremony.\n\nThe writer also said: \u201cWe have been getting a LOT of backlash from our families about this.\u201d Some guests, apparently, feel that travelling to a beach for a sunrise wedding is as unreasonable as it gets. But is it? Is it really?\n\nThe short answer is that, no, obviously it isn\u2019t. Because everything about weddings is unreasonable. Having a wedding in a different country, and forcing all your friends to spend thousands of pounds to go on an externally mandated holiday, is unreasonable. Asking your guests to dress to a specified colour code is unreasonable. Forcing your bridesmaid to lose weight for the ceremony, as one bride did in 2017, is unreasonable.\n\nThe world of weddings is full of pushy couples overestimating how happy their own marriage will make other people. In this context, asking people to wake up slightly earlier than usual is fine. And, as with every other outrageous wedding demand, it\u2019s important to remember that attendance isn\u2019t mandatory.\n\nBesides, I think this is quite sweet. It is a beach wedding that takes place at the literal crack of dawn, so nobody would be expected to stuff themselves into uncomfortable formalwear for the occasion. Plus, once it is over, guests have got the rest of the day to do whatever they like.\n\nIsn\u2019t that the dream? No miserable wedding-reception small talk with strangers the couple mistakenly thought you would like. No rubbish wedding dinner. No forced dancing. No arguments about designated drivers. No crap hotels. Wedding, quick drink, back in time for Loose Women. Perfect. The whole thing sounds perfect. So would I go to a 5.30am wedding? I would. And, yes, this is a request for an invitation.", "description": "One couple has faced complaints after asking friends and family to attend a sunrise beach wedding.
