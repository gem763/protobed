Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) announced Thursday she is considering boycotting the October 15 debate to protest the Democratic National Committee and \u201ccorporate media\u201d rigging the 2020 primary against early state voters.\n\nGabbard said in a video she tweeted that she has met Democrat voters in Iowa and New Hampshire who have expressed frustration to her that the \u201cDNC and the corporate media are essentially trying to usurp\u201d their role as voters in choosing who the next Democrat presidential nominee will be.\n\n\u201cNow the 2016 Democratic Primary election was rigged by the DNC and their partners in the corporate media against Bernie Sanders,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn this 2020 election, the DNC and the corporate media are rigging the election again but this time it\u2019s against the American people in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada,\u201d she added.\n\nShe said:\n\nThey\u2019re attempting to replace the roles of voters in the early states using polling and other arbitrary methods which are not transparent or democratic and they\u2019re holding so-called debates which really are not debates at all but rather commercialized reality television meant to entertain, rather than inform or enlighten. So in short, the DNC and the corporate media are trying to hijack the entire election process. So in order to bring attention to this serious threat to our democracy, and to ensure your voice is heard, I\u2019m seriously considering boycotting the next debate on October 15th. I\u2019m going to announce my decision within the next few days.\n\nI am seriously considering boycotting October 15 debate to bring attention to DNC/corporate media\u2019s effort to rig 2020 primary. Not against Bernie this time, but against voters in early states Iowa, New Hampshire, South\u2026 \u2013> https://t.co/x5P3GFGbyn pic.twitter.com/UgKCj6DGI0 \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 10, 2019\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Tulsi Gabbard is considering boycotting the next debate to protest the DNC and \"corporate media\" rigging the 2020 primary.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/on-stage-with-Tulsi-Gabbard-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
