Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe moment marked the end of a remarkable run for the 19-year-old Canadian, who a year ago had failed to qualify for the tournament but has gone on to become the sport\u2019s brightest young star.\n\n\u201cLast year wasn\u2019t an easy period in my life, I was going through a lot with injuries,\u201d said Andreescu.\n\n\u201cI just kept believing in myself I kept working hard and I just kept that momentum and confidence.\u201d\n\nDespite having never made it past the second round of a Grand Slam, Andreescu arrived at Flushing Meadows with many expecting big things from her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re never going to have ups all the time,\u201d said Andreescu after the match.\n\n\u201cSo I think in those moments, you just have to deal with it the best that you can, which is to just keep fighting for your dreams and just stay as persistent and persevere as much as you can.\n\n\u201cI think it builds you as a character.\u201d\n\nDropping only two sets in the entire tournament, the tenacious, power-hitting Andreescu barreled through the competition at Flushing Meadows, showing no sign of a slowdown from a blockbuster summer that included wins at Toronto and Indian Wells.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lost a match since March, so my confidence is sky-rocketing right now,\u201d Andreescu told reporters. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to take anything for granted because there\u2019s going to be weeks where you\u2019re going to lose. So right now I\u2019m just on cloud nine.\u201d\n\nEnding 2018 with a year-end ranking of 178, she had rocketed to 15th when she arrived at the year\u2019s final major, a meteoric rise that stunned even her coach.\n\n\u201cWhen I play my game I think nobody really likes that because I play a lot different than other players on tour,\u201d Andreescu said. \u201cI like to change up the rhythm and I\u2019ve always been like that and I just kept improving it.\u201d\n\nAndreescu, who said she is a voracious reader of Tony Robbins and other self-help authors, acknowledged that much of her improvement had come from developing mental discipline.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I was ever as composed as I am now, or even a year ago,\u201d said Andreescu. \u201cI would get really down on myself and I would get very negative thoughts going through my mind.\n\n\u201cI would smash racquets. I\u2019d just yell at myself during matches.\u201d\n\nHer surge into the game\u2019s elite culminated on Saturday with a 6-3 7-5 victory over 23-times Grand Slam singles champion Williams.\n\nAnd the upstart said she is not planning on slowing down any time soon.\n\n\u201cI love this feeling way too much,\u201d Andreescu said in a televised interview after the match, as her loyal Canadian fanbase cheered behind her on the plaza outside Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to what I can do in many years to come.\u201d", "description": "So new is Bianca Andreescu to the Grand Slam stage that after beating Serena Williams to win the U.S. Open on Saturday, a tournament official had to show her which side of the trophy was the front.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427401936&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8613D-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
