I didn't believe it. Now, I'm experiencing so many things in Nigeria. Fresh air, fresh food. I'm really happy.\"\n\nAl Jazeera reported on his plight in August and the challenges faced by many other aspiring African footballers who are stranded in several countries, having been duped by people posing as agents and tricking them into paying significant sums to travel and play for foreign clubs.\n\nIn Afolabi's case, a Nigerian man who lived close to his home spun him a tale, took his savings and sent him to play for local Mongolian club Western Khovd FC, but the job did not last beyond his tourist visa and he quickly fell into serious financial and personal problems.\n\nMoshood Afolabi, right, and Christopher Hannah, left, pictured in Mongolia [Courtesy of Christopher Hannah]\n\nChristopher Hannah, a Scottish businessman who had lived in Mongolia for six months, read and empathised with Afolabi's story and volunteered to help him.\n\n\"I had come across Moshood two weeks before I contacted him. I saw the article on Al Jazeera and at the time I was in Scotland,\" Hannah told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"I flew back to Mongolia and I saw it posted again on a forum and I remember someone was asking, 'Why doesn't someone help this guy?'\"\n\nHannah, who was working on setting up a cashmere business in the East Asian country, had previous experience in the football industry and a passion for the sport.\n\nHe was previously an image rights agent for several European football clubs and footballers.\n\n190822123359028\n\n\"Football is one of the best ways to break communication or culture barriers. This was the main reason Moshood and I could come together,\" he said.\n\nAfter the Nigerian footballer spent a week in detention in late September at the Mongolian immigration service, Hannah booked and paid for Afolabi's $900 flight home, while Afolabi's friend Wael, an Egyptian immigrant, gave him the $750 he needed to pay to Mongolia for overstaying his visa.\n\n\"I felt sad because I hadn't experienced it in my life to be in a detention room for seven days,\" said Afolabi. \"For the first three days in detention, I was drinking water, fasting and praying to Almighty Allah to save me.\"\n\nHannah claimed that his life in Mongolia took a turn for the worse after he helped Afolabi, saying he was treated with hostility by locals and was eventually denied a business visa extension.\n\nHe has now returned to his native Scotland and is in the process of opening a new football agency focusing on regions such as Africa.\n\nUp to thousands of scammed African footballers\n\nIt is not clear exactly how many hopeful African players are stranded across the world but according to some estimates, the number is in the thousands.\n\nIn 2017, there was an influx of more than 100 African talents to Nepal, a south Asian country known least for football.\n\nBritish media reported that an estimated 15,000 players are trafficked to Europe annually.\n\nIn Russia, there are dozens of cases.\n\nBeverley Agbakoba Onyejianya, a Nigerian sports lawyer, said being deported can seriously impact a person's state of mind.\n\n\"Being deported may leave a footballer being stigmatised and even anxious about their future opportunities and ability to earn a good income,\" she said. \"The player's career may or may not be affected depending on how they work to find new opportunities.\"\n\nBack at home and reflecting on his journey, Afolabi says he will continue to play his beloved sport.\n\n\"Football is my passion,\" he said. \"I want to use football to help my family and other people that do not have the means. I believe I'll make it in football and I want to continue.\"", "description": "After Al Jazeera reported on Afolabi's ordeal, pair worked to get aspiring footballer back on home turf from Mongolia.", "authors": ["Tolu Olasoji"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/14/4831bb7fc1d14c9cb26547055f4cd2c8_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
