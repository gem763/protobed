Circles are sized by the amounts raised from individual contributions. Notes: Candidates are ordered by their ranking in each quarter. Some candidates raised more money in the third quarter, but their rankings were lower. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. entered the race after the first quarter. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington was the 10th candidate in the first quarter, but he has since dropped out of the race.\n\nJust as Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has climbed steadily in polls, her fund-raising in the third quarter surpassed what she raised in the second, which in turn dwarfed what she raised in the first.\n\nShe and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 two candidates who have sworn off big-money fund-raisers \u2014 led the Democratic field in the last three months, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday. They raised just shy of $50 million in total, more than the bottom 13 candidates put together.\n\n[See who led the money race in the first and second quarter.]\n\nThe two progressives outranked the leading fund-raiser in the second quarter, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who is holding traditional fund-raisers with wealthy donors but has also amassed a sizable pool of grass-roots supporters as well.\n\nFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s ranking also dropped, another indicator that his widespread name recognition has not translated into a flood of contributions from online donors. Mr. Biden raised about $6 million less than what he collected in the second quarter, a decline of nearly 30 percent.\n\nMr. Sanders had his best quarter this year, reporting the biggest quarterly total in the 2020 Democratic race.\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019s haul for the quarter was the latest demonstration of the power of grass-roots donors. As we showed over the summer in our maps of Democratic donors, Mr. Sanders has amassed a huge network of individual donors around the country.\n\nAmount Raised From Individual Contributions (in millions) Note: Third-quarter numbers are from July 1 to Sept. 30. Cycle totals include all activity in the 2020 election cycle. Candidates who reported raising less than $100,000 are excluded.\n\nMr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg have far more cash in the bank than the rest of their rivals.\n\nThere is a huge gulf between what the best-funded candidates have available to spend and what many others in the race have on hand. That makes a big difference in how the campaigns can hire staff and pay for advertising as the first nominating contests approach. For every dollar that Mr. Sanders had on hand at the end of September, Mr. Biden had about 27 cents.\n\nCash on Hand (in millions) Note: Figures are as of September 30.\n\nPresident Trump has more cash than the the three best-funded Democrats combined.\n\nAs the Democratic candidates fight for their party\u2019s presidential nomination, Mr. Trump is able to continue building a huge cash reserve to fund his re-election bid.\n\nCash on Hand for Trump and Top Three Democrats (in millions) Note: Figures are as of September 30.\n\nTen candidates spent more money than they took in from donors.\n\nFor the Democrats struggling to raise money, keeping the lights on is a real concern. Ten candidates spent more money in the third quarter than they collected in donations, even though the Iowa caucuses are still months away. That group included Mr. Biden, Senator Kamala Harris of California and former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas.\n\nBurn Rate Note: The burn rate shown is a candidate\u2019s spending in the third quarter relative to individual contributions he or she received. Contribution refunds are excluded from the spending figures. The burn rate is greater than 100 percent if a candidate spent more than he or she raised. Candidates who are largely self-funding their campaigns are excluded.\n\nTom Steyer spent far more than any other candidate.\n\nMr. Steyer, a billionaire former hedge fund investor who is largely self-financing his campaign, reported spending more than twice as much as any other candidate, with most of his money going toward advertising.\n\nThe leading Democratic contenders have hired big staffs, opened dozens of campaign offices and poured money into Facebook advertising, but their spending in the quarter still paled in comparison to Mr. Steyer\u2019s.\n\nAmount Spent (in millions)\n\nHere\u2019s a full look at how the Democratic candidates compare.", "description": "Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren led the third quarter, raising just shy of $50 million in total, more than the bottom 13 candidates put together.", "authors": ["Sarah Almukhtar", "Troy Griggs", "Thomas Kaplan", "Rachel Shorey"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/us/democratic-q3-fundraising-promo-1571187889375/democratic-q3-fundraising-promo-1571187889375-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
