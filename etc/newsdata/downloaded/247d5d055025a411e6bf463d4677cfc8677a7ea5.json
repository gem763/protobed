Everybody understands Ukraine has big problems in that regard,\u201d Trump said.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s only public comment in recent days was a tweet Wednesday in which he wrote, \u201cEverything I did was to discover evidence to defend my client against false charges.\u201d\n\nFurther scrutiny befell Giuliani after two of his foreign-born associates were indicted on campaign finance charges over allegations of buying political influence on behalf of a Ukrainian government official and a Russian businessman, charges to which the two have since pleaded not guilty .\n\nStill, as Congress continues to collect testimony on Trump and his allies\u2019 efforts to leverage military and diplomatic support for politically motivated investigations from Ukraine, the president presented himself as unfazed.\n\n\u201cRudy Giuliani is a fine man,\u201d Trump concluded. \u201cHe was the greatest mayor in the history of New York, and he\u2019s been one of the greatest crime fighters and corruption fighters. Rudy Giuliani is a good man.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6c/63/783979a54af1a6f171a82f55cf7b/191025-trump-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
