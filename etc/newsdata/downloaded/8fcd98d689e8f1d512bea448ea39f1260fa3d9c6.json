The whole end-to-end solutions to bring high speed mobility to the masses,\u201d said Brian Schettler, senior managing director of Boeing HorizonX Ventures.\n\nSchettler said that with Boeing BA, -0.65% nearing flight of its Starliner astronaut crew capsule and Virgin Galactic on the cusp of commercial operations, the companies are at an \u201cinflection point.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just seemed like from a tech maturity (standpoint), from an opportunity to start driving the next phase of all this, it seemed to make sense,\u201d he said of the investment.\n\nThe collaboration won\u2019t lead to Virgin Galactic\u2019s current craft, a design called SpaceShipTwo, being flown across oceans, but significant lessons are expected from flying people aboard a highly reusable airframe at three times the speed of sound with rapid turnaround times, said Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides.\n\nVirgin Galactic has conducted successful test flights of its winged rocket ship at Mojave, California, and is preparing to begin operating at Spaceport America in New Mexico. Test flights will be conducted there before passenger flights begin.\n\nVirgin Galactic has not announced a specific date for beginning commercial flights but Whitesides said the company is projecting that by mid-2020.\n\nVirgin Galactic announced in July it intends to go public through a merger with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp.\n\nBoeing\u2019s investment is in return for shares, so it is contingent on that transaction closing.", "description": "Boeing plans to invest $20 million in Virgin Galactic, looking at possibilities beyond the space tourism company\u2019s immediate goal of launching passengers on...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS916_virgin_ZG_20191008203130.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
