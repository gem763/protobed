Giving points to each successfully performed manoeuvre, such as flipping the cube around or rotating its face.\n\nIt was programmed to make sure it maximised its score each time.\n\nThe Rubik's cube (pictured above) is a difficult puzzle for humans to solve and now a robot has done it with just one hand\n\nResearchers said it had been challenging to fine tune the AI due to the number of simultaneous points of contact between hand and object which often goes into solving a Rubik\u2019s cube.\n\nThe AI, however, was able to learn to correct mistakes, such as accidentally rotating the cube too much.\n\nJust like a human, the time it took for the robot to solve the Rubik\u2019s cube would depend on how jumbled it had been in the first place.\n\nMr Welinder added the best attempt by hand was around three minutes. A far cry from the 2018 record by Feliks Zemdegs who achieved 4.22 seconds, but was using two hands.\n\nThis is while the quickest with one hand was recorded at 9.42 seconds and was achieved by Max Park from the US.\n\nThe researchers hope that the hand could be further trained to do things like origami and other general tasks.", "description": "California-based company OpenAI created the technology which enabled the robotic hand to solve a Rubik's cube - it is the first to have done so using AI without being designed for the purpose.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/12/19784542-0-image-a-3_1571224736939.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
