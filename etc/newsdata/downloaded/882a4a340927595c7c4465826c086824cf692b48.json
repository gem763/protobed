Photo: Courtesy of Johnston Archive/Sony Pictures Classics\n\nThis article was first published in 2006, but we are revisiting the review in the wake of Daniel Johnston\u2019s death.\n\nIt\u2019s no big news that the line between artistry and mental illness can be perilously thin, but how porous it is in the work of Daniel Johnston \u2014 barely a membrane. In The Devil and Daniel Johnston, the director, Jeff Feuerzeig, tells the one-quarter inspirational, three-quarters nerve-racking tale of the \u201cmanic-depressive\u201d singer-songwriter, visual artist, and cult figure. Although I\u2019m not a member of this particular cult \u2014 which seems to thrive as much on sympathy as admiration \u2014 I found the documentary surprisingly diverting as a case study: not only of a talented misfit sublimating like mad to keep his loneliness from consuming him but also of a fringe artistic community (which includes the makers of this film) that rallies to give him the reinforcement he craves.\n\nThis is one of a new generation of documentaries that have access to a vast library of the subject\u2019s home movies. (Given the modern ubiquity of video cameras, we should steel ourselves for a slew of grade-Z versions of Capturing the Friedmans and Tarnation.) The Devil and Daniel Johnston opens with the twentysomething artist in 1984\u2014a dark, skeletally thin, but not unattractive, young man who introduces himself as the \u201cghost of Daniel Johnston.\u201d It\u2019s quite a non sequitur when Feuerzeig cuts to the present-day Johnston with white hair and an awe-inspiring potbelly. It\u2019s even more startling when, after he\u2019s announced to an adoring crowd as \u201cthe greatest living singer-songwriter,\u201d he begins to screech his simple, repetitive songs in a voice that goes dependably flat every third syllable.\n\nThe above is a little misleading. At their best, Johnston\u2019s folk-rock music and lyrics sound as automatic as breathing while concealing their artfulness, and those wheezing repetitions evoke a mind that\u2019s circling in on hell. (\u201cI\u2019m a loner \u2026 I\u2019m a sorry entertainer,\u201d ad infinitum.) But there\u2019s also a lot of the-artist-walking-among-the-flowers-while-the-world-says-get-a-job stuff. The film compares Johnston to the bipolar Brian Wilson, but Wilson\u2019s music is a triumph of alchemy and much of Johnston\u2019s doesn\u2019t quite transcend the mundane agony of being Daniel Johnston. In that might lie its value.\n\nIt is certainly the value of The Devil and Daniel Johnston, which charts Johnston\u2019s day-to-day life as it evokes his dream life \u2014 mixing tales of dysfunction with songs (many centering on figures like Casper the Friendly Ghost and King Kong) and drawings (eyeballs, heads with their tops lopped off). In college, a woman named Laurie becomes the bella donna of Johnston\u2019s life, the inspiration for a thousand songs \u2014 although he scarcely knew her. As his delusions begin to manifest themselves, the suspense is in how he\u2019ll manage to keep from killing himself or someone else. He runs off with a carnival; stumbles into a church in Texas, after getting bonked in the head for using a port-o-potty too long; and settles into a job at McDonald\u2019s while peddling his tapes to an increasingly fascinated group of music writers and slackers. Feuerzeig keeps each strand in focus \u2014 Johnston\u2019s wayward neurochemistry, his parents\u2019 early censure, his fundamentalist religious upbringing \u2014 to suggest an inner world of submission and defiance. His holy quest is to prove to himself that the artist\u2019s life is not a dance with the devil.\n\nIt\u2019s rather touching when the alt-weekly editor Louis Black beats himself up for pressing for Johnston\u2019s committal. He asks: Would he have committed Van Gogh too? You don\u2019t normally think of rock musicians as Samaritans, but members of Sonic Youth comb New Jersey for Johnston, find him babbling about Jesus in a parking lot, and stick him on a bus to his parents\u2019 house in Virginia. A band he ends up performing with first lays eyes on him as he\u2019s being attacked by dogs. His loyal manager returns years after a brusque dismissal (he made the mistake of negotiating with Elektra, a company that Johnston considered satanic) to \u201cspread the word of Daniel Johnston.\u201d The Devil and Daniel Johnston suggests that if art and madness can be sibling-close, so can art appreciation and altruism.", "description": "In honor of the late Daniel Johnston, we\u2019re revisiting the 2006 documentary \u2018The Devil and Daniel Johnston\u2019 that brought the eccentric musician\u2019s defiant life to screen.", "authors": ["David Edelstein"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/devil-and-daniel-johnston.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
