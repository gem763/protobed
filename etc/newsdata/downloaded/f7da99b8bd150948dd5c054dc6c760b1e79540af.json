Born to a wealthy family in Weston, Conn., he and his wife, Delphine, an interior designer, and their four children today split their time between a mansion in tony New Canaan, Conn., and a Manhattan townhouse.\n\nPenta decided to check in with Krakoff, now that he\u2019s had time to settle in at Tiffany. He admits there\u2019s been a learning curve. Yet despite the ongoing, unpredictable U.S.-China trade war and softening spending by Chinese tourists, Tiffany\u2019s worldwide net sales rose 7% to $4.4 billion last year.\n\nPenta: Since your arrival, what has surprised you most about the brand?\n\nReed Krakoff: There are probably a couple of answers. I grew up with the brand, but didn\u2019t realize the magnitude of it. People have a deep love of its history. Then there\u2019s the level of commitment to craftsmanship. There are no shortcuts, whether it\u2019s a sterling silver keychain or a $20 million 100-carat yellow diamond. That\u2019s something you can forget about when brands get big.\n\nYou\u2019ve been brought in to change things\u2014but not too much!\n\nRight, no problem. [He laughs.] That\u2019s the forever question\u2014how do you move forward without losing what made the brand arguably the most desirable brand in the world? There\u2019s trial and error, a lot of exploration. I\u2019m very fortunate, as Tiffany\u2019s first creative director, to be able to bring different areas [of the company] together; to tell our story in a unified way. So, if there\u2019s a new collection, it may spark an idea for store interiors, which leads to marketing, which leads to events\u2014everything works together. It\u2019s a different way of working in the jewelry business. It\u2019s more typical of the fashion world.\n\nTiffany is perhaps the only brand that evokes such a powerful connection to a color\u2014Tiffany blue. You see a box in that iconic shade and it says so much. What is it about that shade that makes it so recognizable?\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a simple answer. Tiffany has been around many, many, many years, and the experience people have had at Tiffany of finding something to commemorate a pivotal moment in their lives [has been repeated] over and over. You know, a color is a color but this is imbued with such a sense of excitement.\n\nCan you imagine changing the shade? Updating it?\n\n\u201c I\u2019m working in the service of an incredible brand. That\u2019s first and foremost what I think about. \u201d \u2014Reed Krakoff\n\nNo. It\u2019s what every brand dreams to have. It has to be treated with respect.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Tiffany\u2019s annual Blue Book Collection.\n\nIt\u2019s become a laboratory for our most forward-thinking and fantastical designs. It\u2019s the place where ideas begin and are later adapted to the more commercial collection. It\u2019s the place to dream. A recent example of that: We developed a new stone-cutting technique. It took almost a year to make one piece\u2014a small piece\u2014because of its scale and intricacy. It\u2019s as if you had a sheet of diamonds that were fragmented and cracked, with very minimal space between each one. So each stone has to be cut and linked to the next, which is just enormously difficult to do. People weren\u2019t sure we could do it.\n\n[The technique was used in several 2019 Blue Book pieces, including a dragonfly brooch with more than seven carats of custom-cut diamonds, and a 16-plus carat diamond choker debuted by Lady Gaga at this year\u2019s Screen Actors Guild Awards.]\n\nEach piece is like a little sculpture. How does the process for a new work begin?\n\nI don\u2019t really believe in spending a lot of time on inspiration boards. I get inspired as I\u2019m working. We start with more an attitude, sort of a feel.\n\nPeople dress more casually now. Does that worry you?\n\nOne of the things making us unique is that we create pieces that are meant to be worn.\n\nAs opposed to being stored away\u2026\n\nExactly.\n\n\u2026and only brought out on special occasions?\n\nThese are valuable pieces, but should be part of your wardrobe. That\u2019s what American style is about.\n\nDo you use yourself as a guidepost? You\u2019re launching a new men\u2019s collection this fall. Have you been asking, \u201cWould I wear that?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting question. I\u2019m not someone who wears jewelry at all. I have one ring made in the shape of a rubber band, and that\u2019s the only thing I wear. It\u2019s my wedding band.\n\nWhat? You\u2019re an impostor, sir!\n\nBut\u2026[he chuckles]. I\u2019ve always found it\u2019s more intuition. I\u2019m working in the service of an incredible brand. That\u2019s first and foremost what I think about. How does [any new piece] move forward the idea of Tiffany? How does this fit in historically? And how does this take advantage of what Tiffany can do uniquely? All those things come into play.", "description": "The designer became the brand\u2019s chief artistic officer in 2017", "authors": ["Joseph V.
