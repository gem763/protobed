But now there\u2019s a new player hoping to join the catwalk club.\n\nDesigners and industry professionals are flocking to Dubai, which is fast making its mark on the industry.\n\nEvents like Arab Fashion Week in Dubai are helping the emirate makes inroads in the industry, which is now worth around 50 billion euros a year in the UAE.\n\nManuel Arnaut, Editor in Chief of Vogue Arabia, says Dubai has become an important centre.\n\n\u201cYou can feel there\u2019s a very interesting energy and very strong creative vibe,\u201d he told Cult. \u201cAnd what I think is really interesting about Arab fashion in general is the diversity of the options.\u201d\n\nArab Fashion Week is one of the highlights on the industry\u2019s calendar.\n\nIt\u2019s a platform for international and home-grown talent to showcase their designs. It also attracts around 10,000 people every year.\n\nDubai-based Amato is a global designer brand and couture house with a cult following, having dressed the likes of Beyonce, Shakira and Katy Perry.\n\nIt\u2019s headed up by Philippines-born designer Furne One.\n\n\u201cIt all started with Heidi Klum. A friend of Heidi\u2019s saw my collection and then we did a meeting and they proposed for me to do their finale show, and then I met Katy (Perry) and Katy at that time was planning her California Dreams tour so she told me to do the costumes for her.\u201d\n\nFurne credits Dubai as a creative inspiration for his work.\n\n\u201cDubai itself has this identity because we\u2019re the melting pot in the Middle East and the Gulf. Me as a designer, I love elaborate things and they love artistic things you know so that\u2019s why I fell in love with Dubai.\u201d\n\nFashion with a conscience is a priority for a lot of brands in Dubai.\n\nGoShopia is Dubai\u2019s first ever sustainable fashion e-marketplace. It brings together designers and brands that have a more ethical approach in their mindset.\n\nAraceli Gallego, founder of goshopia.com, says: \u201cWe want to change the way we perceive fashion basically. We want to make sure people understand there is another way to dress nicely and be fashionable by being sustainable at the same time. We want Dubai to become one of the hubs of the fashion world.\u201d\n\nDubai is also making waves in interior design.\n\nFashion powerhouse and Lebanese designer, Elie Saab, is collaborating with Dubai property company Emaar on designing an upcoming development.\n\n\u201cI believe Dubai is very influential not just for fashion but for many things,\u201d he told Cult.", "description": "Fashion designers and industry professionals are flocking to Dubai, which is fast making its mark in the world of haute couture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/15/53/62/1000x563_cmsv2_b2114281-315c-5827-95b8-62b3d3bd9070-4155362.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
