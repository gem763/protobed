Gen. Shao Yuanming, deputy chief of the Joint Staff Department of China\u2019s Central Military Commission, on Monday and Tuesday.The talks, which South Korea\u2019s Ministry of National Defense said would cover security conditions and other related issues, are the only bilateral discussions to regularly take place between high-ranking officials since they were first agreed upon at a defense ministers\u2019 meeting in July 2011.Park and Shao are expected to discuss matters of security relating to North Korea, as well as Chinese and Russian jets\u2019 intrusions into South Korea\u2019s exclusive Air Defense Identification Zone, or Kadiz, in July, - an incident that drew heavy protest from Seoul. Park is also set to pay a courtesy visit to Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe, according to the Defense Ministry.The two sides met a total of four times from 2011 to 2014, going back and forth between Seoul and Beijing. In 2015, however, after the United States publicly announced it was considering deploying the Thaad batteries to South Korea, Beijing withdrew from the talks, saying the antimissile system represented a threat to China\u2019s national security.The Park Geun-hye administration in 2016 eventually agreed to station the batteries in Seongju County, North Gyeongsang, justifying the deployment by saying the system was meant to deter North Korea\u2019s growing arsenal of ballistic missiles.Starting from 2017, the Thaad batteries were installed in Seongju, and in retaliation, China imposed a series of economic retaliations on Korea, like banning group tours to the country and sanctioning Korean pop culture content.The measures dealt a significant blow to South Korea\u2019s economy, with Chinese tourism in Korea reduced by half in 2017. Relations have slowly recovered.According to Bank of Korea data from Oct. 8, Korea received 3.9 million Chinese tourists from January to August this year, levels comparable to the years before the Thaad row.Park Jae-min\u2019s visit testifies to such a recovery in relations, with the two sides expected to agree to setting up further communication channels. Beijing, however, is likely to bring up the Thaad issue again, given that its most recent defense white paper claimed the batteries \u201cgravely damaged\u201d the strategic balance in the Asia-Pacific region. Park is also slated to attend the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, an annual multilateral defense forum that China has hosted since 2006, to deliver a speech. North Korea\u2019s Vice Defense Minister Kim Hyong-ryong arrived in Beijing on Thursday to take part in the forum, though a recent cold spell in inter-Korean ties makes it unclear whether the two Koreas\u2019 officials will engage one another.In last year\u2019s Xiangshan Forum, Kim held an impromptu meeting with South Korea\u2019s then-Vice Minister Suh Choo-suk for 10 minutes, in which the two sides confirmed each other\u2019s commitment to uphold a military agreement made at September\u2019s inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang.BY SHIM KYU-SEOK [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
