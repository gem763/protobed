A few months ago the Lib Dems won the Council and European elections in his NE Somerset constituency and Rees-Mogg himself now has a Lib Dem councillor.'\n\nNick Coates, the Lib Dem who will take on Mr Rees-Mogg, said: 'For too long the country has stalled on every major issue, from adult social care to addressing the climate emergency.\n\n'Sadly, Jacob Rees-Mogg doesn't seem to realise there is more to politics than Brexit and foxhunting.\n\n'North East Somerset has an opportunity to demand change. Instead of pitting people against Parliament, which is incendiary language, as a Liberal Democrat MP I will campaign to stop Brexit and make sure every voice in North East Somerset is heard.'\n\nIn order to overturn Mr Rees-Mogg's majority, Mr Coates will have to make major inroads into Labour's 18,757 votes at the last election.\n\nThey will be banking on 2017 voters abandoning Jeremy Corbyn's party due to its continued attempt to appeal to both Leave and Remain voters, refusing to make a decision on which way to go until after the election.\n\nIn addition, comedian and doctor Phil Hammond is also planning to stand against Mr Rees-Mogg for the National Health Action Party.\n\nMr Rees-Mogg declined to comment on the Lib Dem's election campaign.", "description": "Jo Swinson's party is targeting the aristocratic former head of the European Research Group (ERG), believing there is an up-swell of pro-EU sentiment in his North East Somerset seat.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/12/19784358-0-image-a-18_1571224354140.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
