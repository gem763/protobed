Taking the environment into account at the ECB.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe IMF under Ms Lagarde\u2019s leadership has toyed with several unorthodox ideas over the years\u201d \u2014 MEP Markus Ferber\n\n\u201cIt is a good sign that a powerful woman applies for that job and that this institution could be led by a woman for the first time,\u201d Sven Giegold, a Green MEP, said.\n\nLawmakers failed to follow up on major concerns raised ahead of the hearing about Lagarde\u2019s lack of experience as an economist.\n\n\u201cThe IMF under Ms Lagarde\u2019s leadership has toyed with several unorthodox ideas over the years,\u201d said German conservative MEP Markus Ferber on Wednesday morning. \u201cThe era of ultra-easy monetary policy will have to stop at some point and Ms. Lagarde is the one who will have to manage that process.\u201d\n\nEU leaders will take the final decision on Lagarde\u2019s appointment when they meet in Brussels in October.\n\nVague on the details\n\nLagarde\u2019s hearing fell as the eurozone\u2019s central bank governors prepare to meet next week in Frankfurt. Market analysts expect the ECB to unveil more controversial stimulus measures to counter growing economic uncertainty, stemming from Brexit, global trade tensions and a slowdown in growth.\n\nThe Frenchwoman said she plans to ditch the jargon from ECB speeches and make monetary policy easier to understand.\n\nParliamentarians pushed Lagarde to venture into the world of monetary policy, which she has little experience in. Lagarde, who comes from a legal background, in response stressed the need for \u201ccross-benefit analysis\u201d of past and present policies at the ECB before she would provide her judgment.\n\nA similar tactic was used when asked about future actions she might take as ECB president, although she acknowledged ECB policies should be open for review. \u201cA review of the monetary framework \u2026 but also in coordination with other central bank institutions from around the world, is warranted given the circumstances,\u201d she said.\n\nThe IMF boss instead offered her support for the ECB\u2019s easy money programs, which Draghi has employed during his eight-year tenure to keep the eurozone\u2019s economy on an even keel.\n\nLagarde also promised to simplify the language of banking for ordinary people: a move likely to appeal to European parliamentarians, but worsen concerns among ECB-watchers about her lack of expertise.\n\nThe Frenchwoman said she plans to ditch the jargon from ECB speeches and make monetary policy easier to understand. Better communication of the bank\u2019s goals would help people understand if there is \u201cdownside first, and benefits later on\u201d to decisions by bankers, she said.\n\nPlaying politics\n\nClimate was prominent in MEPs\u2019 questions from the Greens and the Parliament\u2019s liberal political group, Renew Europe, which pushed Lagarde on her plans to make monetary policy greener.\n\nCentral bank governors should be careful to damn new technologies too quickly, Lagarde said.\n\nLagarde grabbed the opportunity.\n\n\u201cAny institution has to have climate change risks and protection of the environment at the core of their mission,\u201d she said, while cautioning that \u201cthings can\u2019t change overnight.\u201d\n\nGreen-minded lawmakers have attacked the ECB in the past for buying up \u201cbrown\u201d bonds from companies that carry heavy carbon footprints, like coal companies, as part of its easy money programs. Draghi defended the practice, saying that the bond-buying program is designed to be neutral, and that prioritizing bonds from companies that are more sustainable could upset the economic balance.\n\nWhile Lagarde was cautious about phasing out polluting assets from the bank\u2019s portfolio too quickly, she backed the idea of an EU-wide standard for sustainable investments, which is currently making the rounds in Brussels.\n\nThis so-called taxonomy should be incorporated into the ECB\u2019s work, she said. \u201cI think that is something that needs to be done if we are convinced of the absolute need to unite our strengths to fight against climate change in all our institutions,\u201d she said.\n\nLagarde also showed her political nouse in addressing the risks of financial technology, which have become pertinent in the minds of Europe\u2019s politicians since Facebook announced its plan to introduce its virtual currency Libra next year.\n\nPoliticians and central bankers like ECB executive board member Yves Mersch have warned against the social media\u2019s project, saying it could undermine financial stability and monetary policy.\n\nCentral bank governors should be careful to damn new technologies too quickly, Lagarde said. \u201cGovernors, just like any other policymaker, cannot just cover their eyes and assume things are going to stay [the same] forever,\u201d she said, urging technophobes to \u201ctravel to China and witness the cashless telephone payments system. Travel to California to see what the developments are.\u201d\n\nBut she emphasized virtual currencies, including the one planned by Facebook, need to be regulated.\n\n\u201c[This] really warrants a deep discussion,\u201d she said.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
