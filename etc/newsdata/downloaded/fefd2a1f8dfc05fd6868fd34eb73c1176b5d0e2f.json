Farrell was left prone on the turf but did not leave the field for a head injury assessment. After England\u2019s seven-try victory Eddie Jones claimed Farrell was \u201cmissing part of his nose\u201d as a result of a separate incident but dismissed concerns his captain could be sidelined through injury.\n\nThe USA coach, Gary Gold, had no complaints with Quill\u2019s red card but, after he was shown a video clip of Francis\u2019s clumsy high tackle on Will Hooley only seconds into the match, he said that should have been reviewed if it was a shoulder to the head. Francis charged towards Hooley straight from kick-off and made contact with the USA full-back\u2019s head but the incident was not reviewed by the referee, Nic Berry, despite World Rugby\u2019s public rebuke of officials earlier this week. Francis now faces an anxious wait to discover whether he is cited. Hooley played on but after a separate incident involving the England flanker Mark Wilson, he suffered a concussion and was taken to hospital.. As a result Gold described his side\u2019s evening as a \u201ccalamity in Kobe\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Quill went high on Owen Farrell with the USA coach, Gary Gold, having no complaints at the flanker\u2019s red card. Photograph: ITV Sport\n\nJones refused to discuss the Farrell or Francis incident in detail, saying only: \u201cWe leave it to the judiciary.\u201d He also insisted he did not need to remind his players of the dangers of making high tackles after all World Cup officials were reprimanded by the governing body. \u201cI don\u2019t speak to the players about tackling high because they know where to tackle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe play a tough physical game and we go out hitting people as hard as we can. We want to do it legally but players make mistakes.\u201d Asked if Farrell might have come off the pitch for a HIA, Jones said: \u201cWe have all the medical staff looking for that out there. That\u2019s what they get paid to do.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nThe two incidents in England\u2019s second consecutive bonus-point win in Pool C came only hours after the full written judgment from the Australia wing Reece Hodge\u2019s disciplinary hearing was published. On Wednesday Hodge was given a three-week ban for a dangerous tackle on Fiji\u2019s Peceli Yato. The Hodge written judgment contained the remarkable claim that Hodge had \u201cno effective knowledge of World Rugby\u2019s high tackle framework\u201d and that he had not been specifically coached about it. It is believed Australia dispute the claim.\n\nCokanasiga helps England crush USA as Quill gets World Cup\u2019s first red card Read more\n\nHodge\u2019s tackle last Saturday initially went unpunished despite World Rugby\u2019s clampdown on high tackles. It was one of a number of incidents in the opening matches of the tournament which prompted World Rugby\u2019s extraordinary statement about the standard of refereeing on Tuesday.\n\nPlay Video 0:32 Rugby World Cup: England power past USA on day seven \u2013 video highlights\n\nOnly hours after that statement was published, the World Cup was further plunged into chaos when Samoa\u2019s Ray Lee-Lo and Moto Matu\u2019u received yellow cards for tackles that ought to have led to sendings off. Both players were subsequently cited and on Thursday Lee-Lo was handed a three-week ban, ruling him out of the rest of the pool stage, while judgment on Matu\u2019u was delayed at his hearing for \u201ca period no later than 24 hours\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile Jones declared stage one of England\u2019s campaign done after backing up Sunday\u2019s bonus-point win over Tonga with another against the USA despite a four-day turnaround. \u201cWe move into stage two now, which is Argentina, then we\u2019ve got stage three, four and five,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Tour de France. You don\u2019t need to be in the yellow jersey now. The percentage of time you need to be in the yellow jersey is the time that it counts, not when it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d", "description": "England became involved in the controversy over high tackling at the Rugby World Cup following their victory over the USA", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1149c949b0269a7ab9a13d65a6d03dfa47fab23f/180_146_3959_2375/master/3959.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=46c287277570d15a7b898c4687c4850d", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
