Quite the opposite, actually.\n\nWhen he was shown on the video board in the fourth inning and introduced over the stadium speakers, Trump was booed by fans at World Series Game 5 between the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros. Not long after that, fans chanted \u201cLock him up!\u201d\n\nThe political jabs took a backseat to baseball for the next few innings but came back in the seventh inning when fans hung an \u201cImpeach Trump\u201d banner in right field. It was quickly confiscated by stadium security but was up long enough for plenty of pictures to be captured.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPresident Trump was a special guest at World Series Game 5, joined by Senator David Perdue of Georgia (right).
