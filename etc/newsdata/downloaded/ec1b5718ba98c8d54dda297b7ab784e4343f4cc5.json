They really only got stuck in when the game was lost. Against any of the best teams, you have to go hard from the start. That\u2019s going to be important for us.\u201d\n\nEngland were edged 16-15 by New Zealand at a rain-soaked Twickenham last November in their only meeting since Jones took charge following the 2015 World Cup debacle under his predecessor, Stuart Lancaster.\n\nBut after reaching the semi-finals for the first time in 12 years, England\u2019s players are on the cusp of greatness, according to Jones.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Starting to believe\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cThe reason I took this job is because I saw a team that could be great,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat was the challenge and they are starting to believe it. We have a challenge this week because we are playing the greatest team that there has ever been in sport,\u201d added the former Japan coach, who expects to have wing Jack Nowell available this week after a tweaked hamstring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to look at it as almost a one-off game rather than try to link it to past performances.\u201d\n\nJones, whose starting wingers Jonny May and Anthony Watson combined for three scores against Australia, insisted it was the hard yards on the training pitch, and not pure talent, that has England\u2019s current crop standing on the shoulders of giants.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have talent to get in the front door \u2014 but then you\u2019ve got to have work ethic, you\u2019ve got to be relentless,\u201d he said. \u201cWork\u2019s hard, most people don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d\n\nJones, the Australia coach when England beat the Wallabies in the 2003 World Cup final, also doubled down on his remarks about having little sympathy for opposite number Michael Cheika, who stepped down after his team\u2019s World Cup exit.\n\n\u201cIf we had lost on Saturday, you guys would have been coming at me hard,\u201d he shrugged.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not get too emotional and silly about this \u2014 I\u2019m not an Australian, I\u2019m an England coach. Maybe you have to work that out.\u201d", "description": "Oita (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Eddie Jones believes England have the weapons to upset New Zealand in this weekend\u2019s World Cup semi-final \u2014 as long", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/04432d_eddie-jones-england-treat-game-as-one-off-new-zealand-beatable-insists-england-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
