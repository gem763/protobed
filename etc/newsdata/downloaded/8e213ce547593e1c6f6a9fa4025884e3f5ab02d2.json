Her grandmother, 69-year-old Kathryn Murray, and her fianc\u00e9, 34-year-old Jason Wall, also died in the blaze.\n\nProsecutors said most of the victims were asleep when the fire broke out.\n\nMs Alwood spoke to media outlets before being hit with a gag order, and told CBS News her son had ADHD, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.\n\nShe reportedly told the outlet her son was a \u201cloving boy who deserves a second chance\u201d.\n\n\"Everyone is looking at him like he's some kind of monster, but that's not who he is,\" she said. \u201cPeople make mistakes and that's what this is. Yes, it was a horrible tragedy, but it's still not something to throw his life away over.\"\n\nThe prosecutor who filed the charges against the young boy said he stands by that decision, and that the nine-year-old would likely only face probation.\n\nMs Alwood\u2019s sister, Samantha Alwood, who lived next door and whose daughter, Rose, passed away in the fire, said Kyle deserves to face justice for his alleged actions.\n\n\u201cI think he should go somewhere until he\u2019s legal age to go to juvie,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I think he should go to juvie. And then from juvie to prison. Because at the end of the day, whether he meant to or not, he knew what fire did.\"\n\nMs Alwood reportedly told CBS News that while she believes her son should be punished, the judge should also consider her son\u2019s mental condition.\n\n\u201cI did lose, you know, my family too,\u201d the mother told the outlet. \u201cBut I forgive him. I love him not matter what.\u201d\n\nThe nine-year-old was reportedly accompanied by his paternal grandfather to the court hearing and barely visible throughout the appearance.\n\nA pre-trial hearing has been scheduled for 22 November.\n\nRead more\n\nPolice investigate deadly Indiana house fire as possible criminal case", "description": "A nine-year-old boy reportedly diagnosed with multiple mental disorders appeared in court on Monday to face murder charges after prosecutors said he intentionally set in his family home on fire as his relatives were sleeping.Kyle Alwood was charged in an Illinois court on five counts of first-degree", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4XRE2OLGOHnpY0Smiu5ZjA--~B/aD0zNTA7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/dc179af2aa0a31662b71f9ba02008dfd", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
