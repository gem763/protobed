And if you see Trump as a threat to America\u2019s interests \u2014 which he is \u2014 you should at this point be rooting for as many strong potential nominees as possible. (That\u2019s why I\u2019d also welcome for a surge from one or two of the candidates way down in the polls.)\n\nWhy do I think the field is flawed? Because Biden \u2014 who really does have swing-voter appeal \u2014 doesn\u2019t look sharp right now. Sanders looks sharper, but his democratic socialism is a bigger general-election risk than the Bernie faithful acknowledge.\n\nWarren is running by far the best campaign, with a clear message that echoes the most consistently successful Democratic strategy of the last century: populism. Yet she still hasn\u2019t shown enough instinct for appealing to the voters who swung from Obama to Trump and back to the Democrats in the 2018 midterms. Those voters don\u2019t want their private health insurance taken from them.\n\nIn the weeks ahead, I think Harris has two main jobs. First, she and her top advisers should be honest with themselves about her surprising penchant for mistakes. On Medicare policy, she has twice had to explain that she didn\u2019t mean what she sure seemed to mean. On a radio show, she made a flippant remark about marijuana and Jamaica that her own father, who\u2019s a Jamaican immigrant, criticized. At a town hall, she laughed when a voter used a slur for the mentally disabled (to describe Trump\u2019s agenda), and she later claimed that she hadn\u2019t heard the words.\n\nThere is a pattern here. Harris can be too quick to speak or react without thinking. It\u2019s an understandable problem, because running for president is devilishly hard. But the way to get better at it \u2014 as past winners have done \u2014 is to avoid excuses and be ruthlessly (albeit privately) self-critical.\n\nHer second task is to develop a clearer theory of her campaign\u2019s case. Obama\u2019s was about hope and change. Warren wants to fight for the middle class. Harris stands for \u2026 what, exactly? It\u2019s not always evident, not from her vaguely titled book, \u201cThe Truths We Hold,\u201d and not from her stump speech.\n\nWhen asked about this problem in a recent interview, Harris rejected the poetry of campaigns and said, \u201cI come at issues through the lens of how it actually impacts people.\u201d That\u2019s not good enough. It doesn\u2019t help voters understands her values and priorities.", "description": "The Democratic field is still flawed.", "authors": ["David Leonhardt"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/opinion/15Leonhardt/merlin_160698273_634a6005-f3ef-44aa-8ccd-c066ae269432-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
