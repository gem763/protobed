We are entering into a new phase. Trump has always had two images of himself on national-security issues\u2014as a militarist and as a dealmaker. As he nears the election, he hopes to move from the former to the latter, spending the capital he built up as a hard-liner, and wrong-footing his Democratic opponents. Ever since he got rid of the axis of adults, he has sought to remove the institutional constraints on his decision making, allowing him maximum room to maneuver in line with his instincts and core beliefs, which date back more than three decades.\n\nRead: The quickest path to irrelevance in the Trump White House\n\nAlthough Trump has fired Bolton, he is not wholly rid of him. Everyone has been waiting for a centrist\u2014Jim Mattis, H. R. McMaster, or Gary Cohn\u2014to turn against the president, but they have stayed silent. Ironically, Bolton is now poised to walk through that door. He tweeted 12 minutes after Trump, contradicting the president\u2019s account of his departure. He answered his door to reporters and texted with them, telling one \u201cI will have my say in due course. But I have given you the facts on the resignation. My sole concern is US national security.\u201d Earlier today, Bloomberg reported that Trump and Bolton disagreed over whether to lift sanctions on Iran to help facilitate a meeting with President Rouhani at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nIf Bolton does speak out, it will grow harder for the so-called hawks in Congress to turn a blind eye to criticism from centrists, and to continue to support Trump unconditionally. This is particularly true given that Bolton\u2019s critique of Trump concerns Iran, an issue about which they care passionately. It is not far-fetched to imagine Trump meeting Rouhani with Bolton criticizing the summit live on cable news. Trump will likely react as is his wont\u2014with full-scale attacks on Bolton personally, and on anyone who associates with him. The result could be a new Republican divide on foreign policy, with the challenge coming from the right.\n\nTrump, of course, will have his supporters on the subject. As one official told me: \u201cTrump is right in his orientation. We need to focus first on China. So, ultimately, we do need to get to a different place with the Russians. The more distracted we are by North Korea, the better for Beijing. And we need to get out of Afghanistan or really reduce our role there.\u201d But many Republican foreign-policy experts remain unconvinced.\n\nThe international repercussions of this diplomatic pivot will be profound, particularly because it will be carried out with Trumpian characteristics\u2014with little formal preparation, a focus on summits, and an eye on the politics. Martin Indyk, who served in several senior positions in the Clinton and Obama administrations, posed some interesting questions on Twitter: \u201cWhat do Kim, Rouhani, Xi and the Taliban conclude about Trump\u2019s need for deals with them? And what do Bibi and MBS do as the limb they\u2019re on gets sawn off?\u201d he asked, referring to the Israeli and Saudi leaders. These are the right questions to ask. Absent an external crisis, Trump\u2019s diplomatic pivot will define world politics for the next year, and it has a dynamic of its own. In particular, it puts America\u2019s rivals in pole position. They know that Trump needs his talks not to fail, and they hope he will make concessions to keep them afloat.", "description": "The president is turning away from conflict and toward diplomacy\u2014and that will shape his choice of the next national security adviser.", "authors": ["Thomas Wright", "Senior Fellow At The Brookings Institution"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS2PVAW/facebook.jpg?1568234137", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
