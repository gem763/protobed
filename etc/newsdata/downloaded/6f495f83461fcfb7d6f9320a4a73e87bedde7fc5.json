That information will become part of Facebook's public ad library.\n\nIn addition, advertisers must provide a Tax ID number, Federal Election Commission (FEC) ID number, or a government website domain that matches an email ending in .gov or .mil, if they want to be labeled as a \"Confirmed Organization.\"\n\nSmaller businesses without those credentials can also choose to provide an organization with a verifiable phone number, business email, mail-deliverable address, and a business website with a domain that matches the email or the legal name and and a personal ID of an individual who is buying ads for a Facebook Page.\n\nGroups that do not meet the standards by mid-October will have their ads blocked until they comply.\n\nFacebook will also update its list of acceptable social issues that advertisers can message about, bringing the U.S. list in line with issue lists in countries that have recently held elections.\n\nYes, but: So much money has already been spent on Facebook ads this presidential cycle that it's almost impossible to know how much money may have already been spent on ads with hidden purchasers.\n\nCase in point: Just this week Facebook banned ads from conservative news outlet The Epoch Times, after NBC News reported that in the last month the company had funneled its Facebook ads through other dummy sites to hide their connection to its $2 million pro-Trump campaign.\n\nJust this week Facebook banned ads from conservative news outlet The Epoch Times, after NBC News reported that in the last month the company had funneled its Facebook ads through other dummy sites to hide their connection to its $2 million pro-Trump campaign. By the numbers: Experts estimate that well over $1 billion will be spent on digital ads this campaign cycle, with the majority going to Facebook and Google. For context, that's about as much as analysts expect to be spent on local cable television ads this cycle.\n\nExperts estimate that well over $1 billion will be spent on digital ads this campaign cycle, with the majority going to Facebook and Google. For context, that's about as much as analysts expect to be spent on local cable television ads this cycle. So far this year, the top 8 2020 contenders by Facebook ad spend \u2014 Donald Trump, Tom Steyer, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris \u2014 have collectively spent over $25 million on Facebook ads, according to data from Bully Pulpit Interactive.\n\nthe top 8 2020 contenders by Facebook ad spend \u2014 Donald Trump, Tom Steyer, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris \u2014 have collectively spent over $25 million on Facebook ads, according to data from Bully Pulpit Interactive. The top 7 outside issue groups have collectively spent over $17 million this year.\n\nThe big picture: Facebook has become one of the most important marketing vehicles used in U.S. elections, but there are no laws that govern how online advertising should be bought or tracked. This means that federal election officials, lawmakers and the public have to rely on Facebook and other tech companies to police their own ads.\n\nOur thought bubble: These requirements are a positive step towards transparency online. Since 2016, Facebook has taken the lead in building out a political advertising library. Its efforts requiring more scrutiny will likely be mimicked by other companies.\n\nBe smart: Even though there are no legal requirements around online political advertising in the U.S., political ads on TV are regulated. But those requirements still leave room for organizations to hide their funding source.\n\nFor example, just this week Bloomberg reported that a mystery group has poured $13 million into ads about health care bills. This is par for the course in broadcast advertising, which is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nWhat's next: Over the coming months, Facebook says it will make more enhancements to its ad library and will expand its policy to prohibit ads that expressly discourage people in the U.S. from voting.", "description": "The tech giant aims to make the funding sources of political ads more transparent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/3NZbXmrqio4gXOoOOaLUVrjXI9Q=/0x0:1280x720/1920x1080/2019/08/28/1566956815496.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
