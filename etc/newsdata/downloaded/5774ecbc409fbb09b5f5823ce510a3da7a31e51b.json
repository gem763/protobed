FedLoan has \u201cfailed miserably,\u201d the office added.\n\nAmong other accusations, the agency\u2019s Thursday lawsuit accused the Pennsylvania-based servicer of miscounting eligible payments and giving borrowers bad information about how to achieve loan forgiveness. The eligible-payments count is important because borrowers only get the loan forgiveness after they\u2019ve made 10 years of payments.\n\nFedLoan and its parent entity, the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA), are already fighting a similar case filed by the Massachusetts Attorney General\u2019s office, among other consumer lawsuits that have been filed against them.\n\nFedLoan is the sole company in charge of servicing loans under the controversy-plagued Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\n\nThe PSLF program is designed to wipe away the student-loan debt of people who work in public service jobs such as teaching and nursing. The program went into effect in 2007. Borrowers must make 10 years of qualifying payments before they are eligible for forgiveness. So far only about 1% (1,526) of the more than 100,000 people who have applied for the financial relief have received it, according to the Education Department.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because eligibility details are very complicated, including what sort of loan can be forgiven, which employers are considered a \u201cqualifying employer\u201d and which repayment plans are eligible.\n\nAt a recent Congressional hearing, an Education Department official acknowledged the program has \u201cnumerous obstacles.\u201d\n\nBut borrowers are also getting misleading information from FedLoan about the program\u2019s terms, the New York attorney general\u2019s lawsuit contended.\n\nOn Thursday, New York Attorney General Letitia James said hard-working public servants have been getting \u201cnothing but the runaround and broken promises.\u201d PHEAA\u2019s alleged \u201cabuses have not only denied these dedicated public servants the benefits they have earned, but have undermined the goals of the loan-forgiveness program,\u201d she added.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: \u2018It was like a crusade for me\u2019\u2014how this attorney became one of 96 borrowers to have her student loans forgiven\n\nThe servicer is ready to fight the case, a PHEAA spokesman said.\n\n\u201cOver the years, PHEAA has cooperatively worked with the New York AG\u2019s Office, along with many other regulators throughout the nation, to review specific borrower concerns and to identify and implement appropriate resolutions as they arise,\u201d he said.\n\nPHEAA learned last month that James\u2019 office planned to sue and \u201crepeatedly requested to meet with the NY AG\u2019s Office but the NY AG\u2019s Office declined our efforts.\u201d\n\nLawmakers invited PHEAA to the Congressional hearing last month, but the organization declined the invite. Democratic lawmakers fumed over the perceived snub, pointing out the federal government paid PHEAA $1.3 billion for the contract to handle forgiveness applications.\n\nComplexity isn\u2019t the only reason approval rates are low, according to some critics. They contend borrowers have been misled and mistreated. The American Federation of Teachers is suing the Education Department for allegedly mismanaging the plan.\n\nThe Education Department previously said it\u2019s been \u201cfaithfully administering the complex program Congress passed.\u201d", "description": "The new lawsuit adds to pressure against FedLoan\u2019s 99% rejection rate of loan-forgiveness applications.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS599_tish_j_ZG_20191003124758.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
