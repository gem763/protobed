Or we have a really good first half and our second half has been bad.\n\n\u201cSo until we change that, everybody has their right to say that, for sure.\u201d\n\nAs the Redskins prepare for this week\u2019s home opener against the Dallas Cowboys, addressing the recurring second-half letdowns will be a priority.\n\nSunday\u2019s loss boiled down to two simple post-halftime Redskin realities: A defense that can\u2019t get off the field and an offense that can\u2019t stay on it.\n\n\u201cA total team loss,\u201d Redskins coach Jay Gruden said.\n\nThe problems are nothing new. Last season, the Redskins\u2019 offense scored just 11 touchdowns in the second half of games \u2014 tied for dead-last in the NFL. Further, Washington didn\u2019t score a second-half touchdown until Week 5 of last season (Oct. 8 at New Orleans). The Kansas City Chiefs, by comparison, led the league with 33.\n\nWorse, Washington\u2019s offense failed to score a second-half touchdown in half of its games in 2018.\n\nThe Redskins did score in the fourth quarter of Sunday\u2019s loss in Philadelphia \u2014 a garbage-time touchdown with six seconds left in the game. The Redskins managed only four drives after halftime \u2014 three of which resulted in a three-and-out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s eerie,\u201d Gruden said, comparing Sunday\u2019s collapse to similar offensive and defensive meltdowns last year. \u201cI have to count on the coaches doing a better job and the players doing a better job, period.\u201d\n\nOn defense, the Eagles\u2019 long drives left the Redskins exhausted. Talking to reporters later, cornerback Josh Norman said he was still tired. Philadelphia ran 44 of its 75 plays in the second half, scoring on four of its five drives. The fifth resulted in a kneeldown to end the game.\n\nIf the Redskins don\u2019t fix their problems on third down, expect another long day this Sunday.\n\nWashington converted just 5 of 13 (38%) third down attempts \u2014 while the Eagles went 11 of 17, for 65%. Quarterback Carson Wentz was an astonishing 12 of 13 for 197 yards and three touchdowns \u2014 good for a perfect passer rating \u2014 on third down.\n\nPenalties are again part of the pattern.\n\nAfter being the most-penalized offense in football last season, the Redskins had eight offensive penalties \u2014 trailing only the Cleveland Browns in Week 1. Offensive linemen Donald Penn, Morgan Moses and Ereck Flowers led the team with two each.\n\nOn Washington\u2019s three punts in the second half, two of those drives featured penalties to put the Redskins behind the chains. Fittingly, there was even a penalty on a third, but Philadelphia declined it because it came on third down.\n\n\u201cWith everything that happened, we definitely have to put that on ourselves and take the onus on it because we control the narrative,\u201d tight end Vernon Davis said. \u201cIf we are able to go out and execute and stay focus and do everything we are supposed to do then we will be favored. But (against the Eagles), we could not capitalize on that.\n\n\u201cWe have to get back into the lab, put it all together and learn from our mistakes.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
