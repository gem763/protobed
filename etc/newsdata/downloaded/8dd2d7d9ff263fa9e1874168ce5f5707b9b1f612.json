When the first woman has the courage and can do it, then the others will follow. Fatima Ismael\n\nIsmael's organisation, the Union de Cooperativas Agropecuarias Soppexcca, was bankrupt when she took over, but it is now a thriving cooperative of 650 people.\n\nIn 2003, it became the first organisation to implement a gender-equality policy, and 32 others have since followed suit.\n\nHer organisation works to help female farmers produce, manage, and market their own coffee and offers women producers credit to enable them to buy their own land.\n\nIn this film, we meet Maxima Talavera, who - thanks to a loan from Soppexcca - has been able to improve her home and buy extra farm animals.\n\nShe is now independent and able to provide for her children and ensure they attend school.\n\nSoppexcca also uses the proceeds of the business to help fund a health clinic to detect and treat women with cervical cancer - Nicaragua has the highest rate in the world - and has built seven local schools.\n\nSource: Al Jazeera", "description": "One organisation helps women in rural Nicaragua to escape poverty by gaining land rights and farming skills.", "authors": ["Fatima Ismael"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2015/9/22/075c278f19e9465ea65dfd242dfbfb6c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2015-09-22"}
