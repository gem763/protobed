October 6 marks one year since Kavanaugh was confirmed as a Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put Brett Kavanaugh out on the street,\u201d proclaimed one protester.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be here speaking to any of you today; I was supposed to just be a college student,\u201d said a George Mason University (GMU) student at a podium during the protest, apparently channeling Swedish climate alarmist Greta Thunberg, who said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be up here \u2014 I should be back in school\u201d at the U.N. Climate Action Summit last month.\n\n\u201c[I was supposed to] go get a degree, go to class, and grow up for four years,\u201d continued the student, \u201cand I\u2019m constantly forced by my university to not just fight for justice, but to even fight for an education un-corrupted by Charles Koch.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur courts are under attack, not just by Kavanaugh, but by the Federalist Society, by Charles Koch, and many others,\u201d the student added. \u201cWe beg you to pay attention to George Mason and what\u2019s happening there because if we fail to repel Koch\u2019s attempts at infiltration, it\u2019ll be way too late for anything to be done.\u201d\n\nThe GMU student then announced that members of Sunday\u2019s anti-Kavanaugh protest would need to run for congressional seats if Congress does not see to it that Justice Kavanaugh is removed from the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re here to tell Congress there\u2019s no place for predators on our courts,\u201d the student declared.\n\n\u201cWe want Charles Koch\u2019s meddling in higher [education] and the judiciary to be brought to an end and, most importantly, that it\u2019s time to put Brett Kavanaugh out on the street,\u201d affirmed the student, \u201cand if they refuse, it\u2019s time for you, and you, and you, and me to run for their seats.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "Hundreds gathered in protest\u00a0of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in D.C. on Sunday, one year after Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court.", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/george-mason-student-protest-10619-kavanaugh-screenshot-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
