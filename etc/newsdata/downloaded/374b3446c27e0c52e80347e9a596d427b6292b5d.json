On Tuesday, the Los Angeles District Attorney\u2019s office said that a third man had overdosed on September 11 in Buck\u2019s home after he received \u201ctwo dangerously large\u201d injections of crystal meth. (The man, whose name has not been released, survived.) \u201cWith this new evidence, I authorized the filing of criminal charges against Ed Buck,\u201d Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement on Tuesday. Prosecutors added in court papers:\n\nFrom his home, in a position of power, Buck manipulates his victims into participating in his sexual fetishes [which] include supplying and personally administering dangerously large doses of narcotics to his victims \u2026. Not deterred by the senseless deaths of Moore and Dean, the defendant nearly killed a third victim last week.\u201d\n\nProsecutors also state that Buck attempt to stifle his victim\u2019s attempts to get help; he eventually made it out of the apartment on Laurel Avenue and called the authorities from a gas station. In Buck\u2019s home, the Sheriff\u2019s office found hundreds of photographs of men in what the Los Angeles Times calls \u201ccompromising positions\u201d \u2014 a detail consistent with allegations in a lawsuit filed by LaTisha Nixon, the mother of Gemmel Moore, which asserts Buck kept \u201crevenge porn\u201d in his home.\n\nMoore was the first man to die in Buck\u2019s home, overdosing in July 2017. A 26-year-old escort, Moore wrote that Buck \u201cgave me my first injection of chrystal meth.\u201d On Tuesday, prosecutors accused Buck of preying on Angelenos struggling with homelessness and addiction \u2014 a claim already levied by community activists. As Amanda Arnold at The Cut noted after the death of Timothy Dean:\n\nActivists in the area say Buck has a history of preying on young black man and pressuring them into partaking in dangerous drug use. Jasmyne Cannick, a progressive Democrat who\u2019s running for delegate in the 53rd Assembly District and has worked with Moore\u2019s family, told the Cut in an email, \u201cFor two years, I have worked to bring forth witness after witness who told authorities about Ed Buck and how he uses the internet to stalk and prey on young, Black gay men who are usually homeless, HIV-positive and often work as male escorts.\u201d\n\nIn late July 2018, prosecutors declined to file charges against Buck, citing insufficient evidence. Less than six months later, 55-year-old Timothy Dean was found dead from a methamphetamine overdose. \u201cHad Buck been arrested and prosecuted in the death of Gemmel Moore, chances are he would not have been around to solicit and prey on vulnerable young Black gay men,\u201d Cannick said, responding to Dean\u2019s passing.\n\nBuck will appear in court on Wednesday for his arraignment; prosecutors are requesting that his bail be set at $4 million. If convicted for all three charges, he faces over five years in prison.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
