We were very let down,\" said ribbon skirt designer Agnes Woodward, who lives in Indiana, but is originally from Kawacatoose First Nation, about 115 kilometres north of Regina.\n\nShe said she and her husband, Whirlwind Bull, spent more than $6,000 on flights, hotel, food, transportation and a delegate fee of $400 each. She was unaware that the trip organizer received a substantial provincial grant to cover expenses.\n\n\"We're a lot of money in the hole, and we have a lot of product that did not get promoted or sold there.\"\n\nThe trade mission was the brainchild of Cree businesswoman Heather Abbey, who has received accolades for founding Indig Inc. and promoting Indigenous artisans.\n\nAbbey said she is \"crushed\" that her attempt to celebrate Indigenous culture and artists didn't pan out as she had hoped. She accepts responsibility for some failures, she said, but added that doesn't justify the threats of violence and online hate that she said she is now receiving.\n\nCritics of the trip are disgruntled vendors who didn't sell much merchandise, Abbey said.\n\nTaxpayers' money\n\nAbbey has received $36,786 from Creative Saskatchewan after qualifying for a market and export development grant, according to the arts funding body of the provincial government.\n\nShe's slated to receive the remaining 40 per cent of the more than $60,000 grant \u2014 worth $24,524 \u2014 if she can satisfy the reporting requirements.\n\nHeather Abbey, co-founder of the online marketplace Indig Inc., said she is \"crushed\" that her attempt to showcase Indigenous culture and artists in Japan didn't pan out as she had hoped.

But some of those vendors told CBC News that days before their departure, Abbey contacted many of them to try to postpone the trip until October. In the end, only 14 travelled to Japan.\n\nFaith Starlight, who lives in Calgary and makes beaded jewelry, said one of the first red flags emerged at customs in the Tokyo airport, when Abbey advised the delegates to declare their merchandise as \"gifts\" rather than wares to be sold in the country.\n\nEach person was asked to pay $650 to help cover their hotel cost at the Nikko Narita hotel. Instead, they were booked into a $20-a-night Airbnb accommodation with thin cots. One attendee called it a \"coffin hotel.\"\n\nAbbey defended the change, insisting it was a better location.\n\nBeadwork artist Faith Starlight took a picture of the AirBnB bed \"pod,\" left, where Indigenous artists slept during their trip. On the right is the hotel room where they were supposed to stay. (Faith Starlight)\n\nThe delegates said their fee was supposed to cover a shuttle service to transport them and multiple suitcases full of art, jewelry, fashion pieces and powwow regalia. Instead, they had to navigate the Tokyo train stations on their own dime, with luggage in tow.\n\nThe only \"cultural showcase\" and \"vendor opportunity\" took place at a mall two and half hours outside of Tokyo, where vendors said a group of Japanese seniors briefly stopped exercising long enough to watch the powwow dancers.\n\n\"It was a bust. It really sucked,\" Starlight said. \"Like, I could have went [to Japan] with a handful of earrings and had the same experience, maybe better.\"\n\nSeveral participants told CBC that they confronted Abbey on the fourth day of the trip to demand answers about their itinerary and finances. Abbey reportedly told them she was bad at paperwork, and repeatedly broke down in tears, the participants said.\n\nAbbey confirmed she spent an entire day crying, and decided to leave Japan a day early.\n\nIn the five weeks since returning to Canada, none of the participants CBC spoke to have been able to get photos from a professional photo shoot, nor any reimbursement from Abbey, despite promises that she would refund money.\n\nFrustrated, at least eight delegates have made public posts on social media or spoken to CBC News.\n\n\"She owes a lot of people a lot of money,\" Woodward said.\n\nOne artist said he feels betrayed by a fellow Indigenous entrepreneur, and that makes the experience an even \"tougher pill to swallow.\"\n\n'Due diligence': Creative Saskatchewan\n\nCreative Saskatchewan said it restricted its initial instalment to Indig Inc. to 60 per cent of the total grant money, in order to \"mitigate risk\" on what is the largest single investment it has made via this grant program in this fiscal year.\n\n\"We're doing our due diligence,\" said a spokesperson for Creative Saskatchewan, who added the government agency won't comment further until after it receives a final report from Indig Inc.\n\nMany delegates said they held fundraisers to collect money from friends and family members, and several received financial support from their First Nations bands.\n\n\"It ultimately was very embarrassing,\" Woodward said. \"I felt like I let a lot of people down.\"\n\nIndigenous artists from across Canada travelled to Japan in hopes of showcasing their culture and expanding the market for their homemade merchandise. (Submitted by Agnes Woodward)\n\nThat sentiment is echoed by Indigenous photographer Elicia Munro-Sutherland, who publicly endorsed the mission in numerous media interviews.\n\nMunro-Sutherland didn't end up going to Japan, she said in a Facebook post, because Abbey never booked her flight, despite assuring her otherwise.\n\nAbbey, a businesswoman from Little Pine First Nation in western Saskatchewan, said the delegates were aware that this was her first trade mission abroad, and agreed to be \"guinea pigs.\"\n\n\"It was my first time planning, or even going into an international market. And I was very candid and open about that,\" Abbey said.\n\n\"Am I sorry the vendors did not make more sales? Absolutely. I absolutely am, and I take part of that responsibility upon myself,\" she said.\n\n\"But do I feel like I should be threatened right now? Do I feel like I should have my safety threatened? And all of this backlash? Absolutely not.\"", "description": "Some Indigenous artists who travelled to Japan as part of an Indig Inc. trade mission, partly funded by a provincial grant, say the trip was \"disastrous\" and that they lost thousands of dollars.", "authors": ["Bonnie Allen", "Jennifer Francis Are Journalists With Cbc Saskatchewan."], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5261841.1566942749!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/agnes-woodward.jpg"}
