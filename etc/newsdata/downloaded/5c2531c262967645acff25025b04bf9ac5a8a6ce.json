Corbyn is the most unpopular opposition leader in British polling history, and it would break an iron law of politics for him to win outright from that position.\n\nBritain's profoundly unpopular Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn is a good campaigner. Bloomberg\n\nOn Brexit, though, he's been cajoled into backing a second referendum, so he probably won't haemorrhage as much of Labour's Remainer base as once looked likely.\n\nRealistically, his best hope would be to form a minority administration propped up by the minor left and centre-left parties. But that would temper his radical program and also probably start the countdown clock to another election within a year or two.\n\nMany pundits think the most likely option is the blue door: Boris Johnson wins a majority. His narrative - that he's on the side of the people, who want Brexit done, while other parties are working to frustrate it - sounds compelling.\n\nThe betting markets, though, are only rating that a 54 per cent chance. It's easy to see why: he's going to lose seats in Scotland, and he's probably going to lose a few metropolitan seats to the Liberal Democrats. What is his path to victory?\n\nHe has to win seats in Wales, and in Brexit-voting areas that traditionally back Labour. The Tory brand is toxic in many of those places, - it's a tribal thing - and that makes this a tall order. These voters might feel more comfortable voting for the Brexit Party, or staying home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnson really has to energise, encourage and inspire them. If anyone can do it, he can - but can he?\n\nBoris Johnson is a good campaigner but a Marmite politician - loved or loathed. Getty\n\nIf he does, Brexit is sorted and the country has a chance to stabilise itself - assuming Johnson's erratic and controversy-seeking personality, and his wanton approach to the public finances, can be kept on a leash.\n\nBut if he doesn't? Then it's the black door: another hung parliament. The betting odds on this are about 45 per cent. Like in Australia, British voters as a collective seem disinclined to license a single party to run the show unfettered.\n\nThe Tories would probably again be the largest party, but Brexit would look as undeliverable as ever.\n\nThe question would then be this: would this crop of myopic and partisan politicians just retreat to their corners of the locked room, unable to compromise constructively? Or would they finally come to their senses, and realise that they have to collectively and collaboratively fashion another doorway out of this mess?\n\nIt's hard to escape a sense of grim foreboding that the supposedly most important election in a generation might simply yield . . . more of the same.", "description": "It's hard to escape a sense of grim foreboding that the supposedly most important election in a generation might simply yield more of the same on Brexit, writes Hans van Leeuwen in London.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5519%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5a687235cc081ab5feb5aa13ac6526aaeb6913b7", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
