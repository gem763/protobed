It creates a lot of noise and clouds your judgment.\"\n\nObama spoke about entering office during the Great Recession and told attendees it's been said that the presidency is like \"drinking out of a fire hose.\"\n\n\"That's doubly true when you're in the middle of a crisis,\" Obama said.\n\nA president can't absorb all the information on their own when making a decision, so it's important to have teams to provide information and context about the problem, he said.\n\n\"Then what you have to do is create a process where you have confidence that whatever data is out there has been sifted and sorted,\" Obama said.\n\nObama said that because there's so much information out there now, including \"opinion wrapped up as fact\" and clickbait, it's important to filter through the noise.\n\n\"What it does mean is that if you are susceptible to worrying about what are the polls saying or what might this person say about this topic, or you start mistaking the intensity of the passion of a very small subset of people with a broader sense about your country or people who know something about the topic, that will sway your decision-making in an unhealthy way,\" Obama said.", "description": "At Splunk's \"The Beginning of Everything\" event in San Francisco on Wednesday, former President Barack Obama spoke about making decisions.", "authors": ["Rosalie Chan"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d49ade3100a244529676589-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
