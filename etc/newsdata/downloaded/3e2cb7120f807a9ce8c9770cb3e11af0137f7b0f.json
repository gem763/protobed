Biles holds 17 gold medals across four championships against 12 for Scherbo, who competed in five world events between 1991 and 1996.\n\nBiles has extended her legacy as one of the best gymnasts of all time in Stuttgart this week but she has not had time to sit back and take in her achievements.\n\n\u201cWhat is it supposed to feel like?\u201d Biles said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t get time to think about these things. I think about my performances and then... dinner.\u201d\n\nFour-time Olympic champion Biles was joined on the podium by team mate Jade Carey, who finished with an average score of 14.883 for her second world medal in three years on the apparatus.\n\nBritain\u2019s Ellie Downie landed two well-executed vaults to claim bronze for her first individual medal at the worlds.\n\nBiles arrived in Stuttgart as joint women\u2019s record-holder on 20 medals with Svetlana Khorkina but broke the tie with the Americans\u2019 fifth consecutive team gold on Tuesday before winning her fifth all-around title two days later.\n\nShe had the opportunity in Saturday\u2019s asymmetric bars final to become the most decorated gymnast ever at the worlds but failed to repeat her silver-medal display from Doha last year and settled for fifth spot.\n\nNina Derwael of Belgium earned the gold by finishing 0.233 points ahead of second-placed Becky Downie of Britain, while 16-year-old American Sunisa Lee finished with bronze.\n\n\u201cThis was such an incredible week,\u201d the 19-year-old Derwael said.\n\n\u201cFirst qualifying for the Olympics with the team, that was our main goal here, and then the all-around final that went really, really good for me, and just now like ending with this high note, just it\u2019s incredible.\u201d", "description": "Simone Biles claimed a record-equaling 23rd medal at the gymnastics world championships on Saturday, leading an American one-two finish in the vault final in Stuttgart.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440099267&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0HH", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
