But while the body count of modern conflict has been reduced, the psychological impact is just as destructive. Conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have left soldiers and their families ravaged by the pressures exerted by guerrilla warfare. In contact situations where troops have stepped into IEDs traps, operated in close hand combat and dealt with a rapidly evolving enemy, the mental aftershocks are too often all-consuming.\n\n\u201cPTSD was slow moving, sluggish,\u201d wrote Fox in Battle Scars. \u201cIt crept into the corners of my life, enwrapping my mind and body, emptying me as I became detached, disorientated and indifferent to the things that ordinarily would have brought me happiness \u2014 my family, a football match on the TV, a few beers in the pub with mates. Intensifying anger, anxiety and a lack of sleep only added to the internal dread that life had become a pretty rough ride.\u201d\n\nIn the time of Peaky Blinders, the stigma attached to shellshock was as debilitating as the condition itself. War veterans often refused to seek help for fear of being dismissed as cowards. In the show, both Tommy and Arthur turn to drugs to drown out their respective demons. Modern service men experience similar issues: pride, the fear of rejection from their fellow soldiers and a loss of self are all obstacles that can hinder treatment. In Battle Scars, Fox details a psychiatric care process in the military that left him struggling to function until he received outside help from a private therapist. From there he was able to move into recovery. Given the statistics (in a recent study, the number of active and ex- service members experiencing PTSD was 6% between 2014 and 2016; between 2004 and 2006 the number was 4%) and the shortfall in aftercare for military personnel experiencing such issues, there is huge level of work to be done.", "description": "How PTSD influences the gangland lives of the characters in Peaky Blinders", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07r5jft.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
