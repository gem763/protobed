There followed four more tries in the next 16 minutes for New Zealand to race to 63-0.\n\nOne of them went to lock Scott Barrett, who joined his brothers Beauden and Jordie as try-scorers, supplementing their milestone as the second trio of brothers to play in the Rugby World Cup after the Vunipola brothers of Tonga in 1995.\n\nThere was no more scoring through the last quarter, but only because the pace the All Blacks were playing at was too quick for even themselves, and passes were knocked on or forward. Dominating almost every category and making most of the running, the All Blacks made 15 handling errors. They had more than 60 percent of the ball, and 70 percent of the turf.\n\n___\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nA South African news outlet says the country\u2019s human rights commission has announced it will take Springboks player Eben Etzebeth to court over an alleged case of racial abuse.\n\nNews24 reports that the South African Human Rights Commission has decided to begin legal proceedings against Etzebeth at an equality court on Friday, the same day he is due to play in a crucial game for the Springboks against Italy at the Rugby World Cup in Japan.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the court will require that Etzebeth return home to take part in proceedings.\n\nEtzebeth was accused of racially abusing a person while on a night out during a vacation in the South African coastal town of Langebaan before the World Cup started. He was also accused of assault. He has denied both allegations. SA Rugby has promised to cooperate with authorities but also backed Etzebeth, saying we \u201ctrust our people to act responsibly.\u201d\n\n____\n\n8:05 p.m.\n\nNew Zealand leads Canada 28-0 at halftime in their Pool B match under the roof in Oita.\n\nNew Zealand had four converted tries, but missed at least four more.\n\nThe first points came from a penalty try after a pushover attempt between the posts was interfered with by Canada scrumhalf Gordon McRorie.\n\nWinger Jordie Barrett, impressive center Sonny Bill Williams, and fullback Beauden Barrett scored the other tries as the All Blacks made almost all the running.\n\nThe missed chances included lock Scott Barrett dropping the ball over the tryline, scrumhalf TJ Perenara diving over a ruck and planting the ball short, and lock Patrick Tuipolotu dropping an increasingly greasy ball in the humidity after Williams broke from a ruck.\n\nCanada had a chance after a miscommunication behind a New Zealand ruck was pounced on by McRorie. Flyhalf Peter Nelson was in support and ran 50 meters but he was dragged down short of the tryline by Beauden Barrett.\n\n___\n\n6:35 p.m.\n\nFrance finally broke spirited resistance from the United States with three late tries to win their Rugby World Cup Pool C match 33-9.\n\nThe French got five tries and an attacking bonus point, but it was a largely sloppy performance as the U.S. team closed the gap to 12-9 with a little more than 15 minutes left after AJ MacGinty landed his third penalty.\n\nBut the French went up a level when it counted.\n\nCenter Gael Fickou, replacement scrumhalf Baptiste Serin and replacement prop Jefferson Poirot all scored late to give the result a glossy scoreline France didn\u2019t really deserve.\n\nUltimately, France\u2019s strong bench made the difference and handed the U.S. Eagles their second defeat after a 45-7 loss to 2003 champion England.\n\nFrance led 12-6 at halftime, with flyhalf Camille Lopez setting up tries for wingers Yoann Huget and Alivereti Raka with kicks over the defense into the corners.\n\nBut the French made too many errors against a competitive U.S. scrum and MacGinty slotted two first-half penalties from in front of the posts.\n\n___\n\n5:35 P.M.\n\nFrance leads the United States 12-6 at halftime in a scrappy Rugby World Cup Pool C match.\n\nFlyhalf Camille Lopez set up both France tries with kicks over the top of the defense.\n\nLeft winger Yoann Huget got the first after six minutes and, after flyhalf AJ MacGinty landed a U.S. penalty from in front of the posts, winger Alivereti Raka got the second French try with a clean catch in the right corner.\n\nFrance made 12 changes from the opening-game win over Argentina and made far too many careless mistakes.\n\nThe U.S. pack competed well against the French forwards - who swapped out their eight from the opening game - and three times camped near the French line in the first half.\n\nMacGinty slotted over another close-range penalty after France infringed again.\n\nA minute\u2019s silence was held before kickoff in memory of former French President Jacques Chirac, and France\u2019s players wore black armbands.\n\nChirac, who died last Thursday at the age of 86, was president from 1995 to 2007.\n\n___\n\n4:50 p.m.\n\nA minute\u2019s silence has been held in memory of former French President Jacques Chirac before France\u2019s Rugby World Cup match against the United States.\n\nChirac died last Thursday at the age of 86. He was president from 1995 to 2007.\n\nFrance\u2019s players are wearing black armbands on their blue jerseys for the match at Fukuoka\u2019s Hakatanomori Stadium.\n\n___\n\n3:45 p.m.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Samoan counterpart Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi have taken a little time out from official business to talk rugby.\n\nThe two leaders swapped signed team jerseys ahead of the Japan-Samoa Pool A game at the Rugby World Cup.\n\nWith a touch of diplomacy, Prime Minister Abe said he was confident it would be \u201can excellent game\u201d in Toyota on Saturday. Host Japan will be on the brink of a first appearance in the quarterfinals if it beats Samoa.\n\nMalielegaoi is on an official visit to Japan and is expected to watch the game at City of Toyota Stadium. He congratulated Abe on the host team\u2019s fabulous start, when it beat Russia and then upset Ireland to lead the group. He also praised Japan\u2019s hosting of the tournament, the first Rugby World Cup in Asia.\n\nAbe was at the opening game to watch Japan\u2019s victory over Russia. Malielegaoi won\u2019t have enjoyed Samoa\u2019s last outing - a 34-0 loss to Scotland.\n\n___\n\n3 p.m.\n\nSamoa winger Ed Fidow has been cleared to play in the Rugby World Cup by a judicial committee after a hearing on Wednesday in regard to his red card against Scotland.\n\nThe committee ruled that the red card issued in Monday\u2019s game was sufficient punishment.\n\nFidow was issued two yellow cards, both of which conceded penalty tries.\n\nThe first was for going into the side of a rolling maul and collapsing it. The committee said that was a technical offense.\n\nThe second was for going knees first into Sean Maitland as the Scotland winger was sliding toward the tryline. The jolt knocked the ball from Maitland\u2019s grasp.\n\nThe committee said that yellow was for \u201ca minor act of foul play which would not have warranted a yellow card but for the fact that the player had prevented a try being scored.\u201d\n\nSamoa lost the match 34-0 in Kobe.\n\nFidow is available to face Japan on Saturday in Toyota.\n\n___\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nSergio Parisse is back to captain Italy against South Africa, when an Italian win would put them through to the quarterfinals for the first time.\n\nParisse will also become the most capped player from the northern hemisphere when he runs on in Shizuoka on Friday. He\u2019ll play his 142nd test, overtaking former Ireland center Brian O\u2019Driscoll. Only former All Blacks captain Richie McCaw has played more tests (148).\n\nParisse\u2019s return at No. 8 is one of three changes to the starting lineup by coach Conor O\u2019Shea but the only change in the forward pack from the 48-7 win over Canada last Thursday. Parisse replaces flanker Sebastian Negri.\n\nSouth Africa-born Braam Steyn, who played at No. 8 vs. Canada, returns to the blindside flank for the game against the Springboks. There are two changes in the backline, with scrumhalf Tito Tebaldi and center Luca Morsi into the team. Michele Campagnaro switches from center to wing.\n\nO\u2019Shea matched South Africa\u2019s selection by also picking just two backs on his eight-man bench, with the game expected to be decided in the forward exchanges.\n\nItaly opened with wins over Namibia and Canada and faces its first stern test in Japan against the two-time champion Springboks, who effectively need to win to stay alive at the World Cup.\n\nItaly: Matteo Minozzi, Tommaso Benvenuti, Luca Morsi, Jaden Hayward, Michele Campagnaro, Tommaso Allan, Tito Tebaldi; Sergio Parisse (captain), Jake Polledri, Braam Steyn, Dean Budd, David Sisi, Simone Ferrari, Luca Bigi, Andrea Lovotti. Reserves: Federico Zani, Nicola Quaglio, Marco Riccioni, Alessandro Zanni, Federico Ruzza, Sebastian Negri, Callum Braley, Carlo Canna\n\n___\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nAustralia head coach Michael Cheika has given teenager Jordan Petaia at test debut as one of 13 changes to his starting lineup for the Rugby World Cup Pool D game against Uruguay.\n\nThe Wallabies are coming off a 29-25 loss to Six Nation champion Wales last Sunday in a game that likely will decide top spot in the group.\n\nMichael Hooper will play his third game of the tournament, leading a largely second-string XV on Saturday at Oita against the Uruguayans, who opened with an upset win over Fiji but are coming off a loss to Georgia.\n\nThe 19-year-old Petaia will start on the left wing, becoming the first Wallaby to make his test debut at a Rugby World Cup since Berrick Barnes in 2007.\n\nIn the backline, Nic White and Christian Leali\u2019ifano will combine again in the halves, restoring the pairing that opened the tournament against Fiji, and Tevita Kuridrani will get his first start of the tournament.\n\nAustralia: Kurtley Beale, Dane Haylett-Petty, Tevita Kuridrani, Matt Toomua, Jordan Petaia, Christian Leali\u2019ifano, Nic White; Jack Dempsey, Michael Hooper (captain), Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, Adam Coleman, Rob Simmons, Allan Alaalatoa, Folau Fainga\u2019a, James Slipper. Reserves: Jordan Uelese, Sekope Kepu, Taniela Tupou, Rory Arnold, David Pocock, Will Genia, James O\u2019Connor, Adam Ashley-Cooper.\n\n___\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nDay 13 of the Rugby World Cup will have a North American flavor with the United States and Canada in action against two of the heavyweights of the sport.\n\nThe U.S. Eagles are coming off a 45-7 loss to 2003 champion England and will face a France lineup that opened with a crucial Pool C win over Argentina. The French are three-time finalists at the Rugby World Cup but have been inconsistent in recent seasons.\n\nThe Canadians have the toughest assignment of the week on Wednesday in Oita, facing a New Zealand All Blacks lineup that is aiming for a third consecutive world title.\n\nThe All Blacks opened with a 23-13 win over two-time champion South Africa and are hot favorites to top Pool B. Canada lost 48-7 to Italy in its opening match.\n\n__\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on Day 13 at the Rugby World Cup in Japan (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/02/japan_rugby_wcup_england_usa_30672_c0-194-2860-1861_s1770x1032.jpg?c11e2e311e3ec6a583faa71a600dcaf6d87e8e58"}
