The labor market\u2019s recent performance remains consistent with an economy that is expanding but at a slower pace than last year. Through July, employers were adding jobs at a healthy clip and unemployment was hovering near historic lows.\n\nHere is what to watch for in the August report, expected Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nPayrolls Performance\n\nKeep a close eye on how many workers employers added to payrolls in August. The payroll estimate, one of the most comprehensive and timely numbers on how the economy is performing, will take on added importance in a month characterized by sharp economic slowdowns overseas, faltering manufacturing and market volatility. Over the first seven months of the year, employers added an average 165,000 jobs a month, a slowdown from an average 223,000 in 2018, but still a solid pace. Economists project 150,000 jobs were added in August.\n\nHours Worked\n\nMonitor Friday\u2019s report closely for any decline in employees\u2019 hours, a sign of increasing business caution. In the face of uncertainty or flagging demand, companies will cut hours before they lay off employees. Recent data show this has been happening already. In July, average weekly hours worked among all private-sector employees fell 0.6% from a year earlier, with particularly steep cutbacks in manufacturing workers\u2019 hours. Growth in aggregate weekly hours among private-sector employees, the product of private-sector payrolls and average weekly hours worked, also slowed to 1.1% in July from a year earlier, from 2.4% in January.\n\nParticipation Pullback\n\nWatch for whether the share of Americans in their prime working years working or seeking jobs declined in August. The so-called labor-force participation rate for prime-age workers, those who are 25 to 54 years old, hit a recent peak of 82.6% in January. It has trended lower since then, reaching 82% in July. The slide could be exacerbating labor shortages, an impediment to job growth. If participation among working-age Americans picks up in August, take it as an indication employers are pulling in people from the sidelines to fuel the economy.\n\nStabilizing Wages\n\nHourly wage growth likely won\u2019t break out in August, if recent history is any indication. Hourly wages rose 3.2% in July from a year earlier, down from a recent high of 3.4% in February. There are various reasons why wage growth might not be accelerating in a tight labor market, including lackluster productivity growth and the retirement of highly paid baby boomers.\n\nShrinking Slack?\n\nWatch for a decline in part-time workers looking for full-time work in August. The number of so-called involuntary part-time workers hit the lowest level since 2006 in July, which could be good news if it is driven by such workers getting full-time jobs. But it could be worrisome if it reflects part-time jobs being eliminated by employers cutting back on hours.\n\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com", "description": "The August employment report to be released Friday will provide the latest view of the economy\u2019s health during a month of global economic turbulence and heightened Wall Street jitters.", "authors": ["Sarah Chaney", "Sarah.Chaney Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103981/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
