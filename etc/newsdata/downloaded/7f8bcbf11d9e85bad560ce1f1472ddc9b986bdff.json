I didn\u2019t believe that there was a way out and I was totally OK with that.\u201d\n\nMagson, now 27, an eating disorder campaigner and the chair of the charity Anorexia and Bulimia Care had been living with an eating disorder since his early teens. \u201cI was struggling with my identity and with being gay in a small town in North Yorkshire, plus my parents both had a cancer diagnosis, and I found that making myself sick was a form of control,\u201d he says. \u201cBy the time I was 18 I was really sick and my mother helped me to find a doctor, but he just told me that men don\u2019t have anorexia. I was completely dismissed. It made me so embarrassed that I just lied about it. I told my mum I was on the road to recovery and went to university where everything just got worse and worse.\u201d\n\nMagson\u2019s experience is not an unusual one. While statistics suggest that the number of men either presenting with or living with eating disorders and body dysmorphia are on the increase \u2013 a 2015 paper on the subject funded by the UK Medical Research Council found that 25% of those with eating disorders are male \u2013 talking about the issue remains a problem for many men. The same paper went on to suggest that less than 10% of men living with an eating disorder seek professional help.\n\nSmall wonder, then, that the actor Christopher Eccleston made headlines when he discussed his lifelong experience with anorexia and dysmorphia. \u201cMany times I\u2019ve wanted to reveal that I\u2019m a lifelong anorexic and dysmorphic,\u201d he wrote in his memoir I Love the Bones of You. \u201cI never have. I\u2019ve always thought of it as a filthy secret, because I\u2019m northern, because I\u2019m male and because I\u2019m working class.\u201d\n\nEccleston is not the only celebrity to have tackled the issue. Harry Potter and Twilight actor Robert Pattinson recently spoke about his anxiety and struggles with body dysmorphia, while Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has also discussed ongoing issues with gaining the perfect physique. James McVey, guitarist with the Vamps, opened up about his \u201cnegative relationship with food\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen people speak out in this way it does a great deal to help reduce the shame and stigma around male eating disorders,\u201d says Robert Wilson, chair of the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Foundation. \u201cThat said, even conversations such as this can feel like grains of sand in the Sahara. There are still significant challenges to overcome.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robert Pattinson is among the celebrities who have helped raise awareness of male eating disorders.

Journalist and author Nate Crowley had hidden his bulimia for years before being moved to talk about it on Twitter after seeing Eccleston\u2019s comments. \u201cOne of the reasons I never spoke about it was because I am a larger man and I always remember John Prescott talking about his bulimia and how slammed he got \u2013 all those jokes about well, it\u2019s clearly not working,\u201d he says. \u201cSeeing the different reactions to Christopher Eccleston\u2019s comments made me think that things were changing and that I could talk about my experiences. That had seemed impossible until now.\u201d\n\nCrowley admits that he was taken aback by the huge response to his admission but adds that talking about it doesn\u2019t instantly solve everything. \u201cI\u2019ve been better for the last year but even now there are times when I have the urge,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a larger man you\u2019re the last person anyone suspects. If anything, they think that you probably have too healthy an approach to food.\u201d\n\nRhik Samadder, whose memoir I Never Said I Loved You is bruisingly honest about his own experiences with eating disorders, mental health and self-harm, adds that it is important to look at the reasons why men still struggle to admit to a problematic relationship with body image.\n\n\u201cThe dark side of social media is that it democratises everything,\u201d he says. \u201cSo you see men increasingly struggling with self-image with gym culture and orthorexia [a preoccupation with eating healthy food] and becoming hyper-conscious about how they look on screen.\n\n\u201cIn my case it didn\u2019t help that I was also born into a culture that made me feel as though I wasn\u2019t wanted because of how I looked being brown. I think what I was trying to do was make myself invisible and not a target.\u201d\n\nCompounding the problem is the fact that the shame felt by many men means that they do not seek help until they reach crisis point, says psychologist and psychotherapist Dr Christian Buckland. \u201cBecause eating disorders are still often seen as a women\u2019s issue men do struggle with the idea that they might be the only guy in the room,\u201d he says. \u201cWith male patients there can be high drop-out rates. There\u2019s definitely a sense that men linger far more before presenting at clinics and thus are often in dire straits by the time that they do seek help.\u201d\n\nDanny Bowman, vice-chair of the charity MaleVoiceEd, which focuses on male eating disorders, agrees that there is an ongoing issue with health provision. \u201cWe get a lot of men coming to us who were too ashamed to talk about their issues or felt that they couldn\u2019t be the only man in the room,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cMuch more needs to be done, especially within the professional field, to improve our levels of understanding around men\u2019s body images and eating disorders.\u201d\n\nIn the UK, the eating disorder charity Beat can be contacted on 0808 8010677 or emailed at help@beateatingdisorders.org.uk (over-18s); studentline@beateatingdisorders.org.uk (students); or fyp@beateatingdisorders.org.uk (under-18s).
