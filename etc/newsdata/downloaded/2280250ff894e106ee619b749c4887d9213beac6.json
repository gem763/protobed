But I didn\u2019t want to bond with him because I thought that if I was going to die, then it would kinder on him if he hadn\u2019t got to know me.\n\n\u201cI thought the right thing was to spend time with my daughter Catherine, who knew me already and would have memories with me. So while my husband spent time with Fraser every day, I hardly ever went to the hospital to visit him.\n\n(Image: PETER JOLLY NORTHPIX)\n\n\u201cMy mindset only started to change when I realised the treatment I was receiving was working and I was actually doing OK.\n\n\u201cNow I can\u2019t get enough of Fraser \u2013 we have such a wonderful relationship. He\u2019s such a mummy\u2019s boy.\u201d\n\nHannah was diagnosed with multiple myeloma last October, three weeks after giving birth prematurely to Fraser.\n\nHannah said: \u201cMyeloma was never something any of my pregnancy team would have looked for. I was told it was almost unheard of in someone my age, and that while the condition could be treated, there was no cure.\n\n\u201cThe consultant told me, \u2018Please don\u2019t Google \u2019. But I did and, from what I read, I was sure I had just months to live.\u201d\n\n(Image: PETER JOLLY NORTHPIX)\n\nHannah started four months of chemotherapy before being sent 170 miles from home to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow for a stem cell transplant.\n\nShe said: \u201cMost people are kept in hospital for 14 days after a stem cell transplant but I was in for five weeks, as I didn\u2019t recover quickly enough \u2013 probably because my body hadn\u2019t had time to recover from pregnancy before my cancer treatment began.\n\n\u201cCatherine came down to visit a few times but I didn\u2019t see Fraser at all.\u201d\n\nWhen Hannah was finally allowed home, her recovery came on in \u201cleaps and bounds\u201d.\n\nAs she grew mentally and physically stronger, she started to spend more time helping to care for both her children.\n\nTwelve months on from her diagnosis, Hannah\u2019s cancer is in remission, and while she knows it will return one day, she doesn\u2019t dwell on her illness.\n\nHannah, who plans to return to work next year, said: \u201cThe treatment I\u2019ve had has worked so well there is no sign of cancer in my blood.\n\nMy cancer is asleep and while I know it will wake up again one day, no one knows when that will be.\n\n\u201cIt could be in six months or in six years \u2013 there is no way to predict. I just have to hope that, in the meantime, scientists will find a cure.\n\n\"I don\u2019t waste a lot of time thinking about my illness \u2013 it doesn\u2019t often cross my mind that I have cancer.\n\n\u201cInstead, I\u2019m enjoying living my life, doing as much with my children as I possibly can. I know how precious life is and I don\u2019t intend to waste a minute.\u201d\n\nHannah is grateful for all the support she has received including from her family, friends and medical staff who helped care for Fraser for the first 10 weeks of his life.\n\nShe has also received support from the charity Myeloma UK, which provides information and support to anyone affected by the disease and helps funds research towards finding new treatments and a possible cure.\n\nHannah added: \u201cI\u2019ve learned you can live life even when you are diagnosed with a cancer that currently has no cure. My advice to others is keep positive.\u201d", "description": "Hannah Toohill, from Scotland, thought it would be kinder if son Fraser never got to know her - but months later had a change of heart", "authors": ["Jenny Morrison", "Image", "Daily Record", "Peter Jolly Northpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20711645.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Hannah11JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
