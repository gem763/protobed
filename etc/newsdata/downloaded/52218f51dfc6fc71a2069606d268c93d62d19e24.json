Several drivers had to slam on their brakes, get out of their cars and corral the children, who were as young as about 18 months.\n\nA teacher at the school told a woman who found the toddlers that nobody had noticed they were gone. They apparently left through a gate that malfunctioned.\n\nGilbert police are investigating the incident.\n\nThe school said it contacted the parents of the children involved, suspended teachers and self-reported to the state's childcare licensing agency.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Arizona Republic, http://www.azcentral.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
