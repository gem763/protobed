REUTERS/Luke MacGregor\n\nThe FTSE 100 index .FTSE rose 0.4%, boosted by heavyweight miners such as Glencore (GLEN.L) and Anglo American (AAL.L) after U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to delay increasing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports.\n\nThe mid-cap index .FTMC added 0.2% by 0809 GMT to scale its highest level in nearly a year. The index has gained more than 3% so far this month as fears of a no-deal Brexit receded.\n\n\u201cInvestors are lapping up any sign of positivity and any excuse to get pushed up the risk curve,\u201d Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said.\n\nIn news-driven moves, BAT (BATS.L) advanced 2.8% after the world\u2019s second largest tobacco company by sales said it planned to lay off employees globally and focus on newer smoking options such as e-cigarettes. Its shares were the single biggest boost on the main index.\n\nMorrisons (MRW.L) climbed 3% after Britain\u2019s No.4 grocer posted a 5.3% rise in first-half pretax profit that surpassed analysts\u2019 forecasts and announced a special dividend.\n\nMeanwhile, Premier Inn owner Whitbread (WTB.L) slipped 3% and Intercontinental Hotel (IHG.L) 2.2% after JPMorgan downgraded the stocks to \u2018underweight\u2019, citing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment.\n\nMarkets participants were also awaiting the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting later on Thursday to see how far policymakers will go to support a flagging eurozone economy.\n\n\u201cInvestors are after not only a rate cut, but a new round of the central bank\u2019s asset purchase programme as well. Anything less than that may leave a bitter taste in the market\u2019s mouth,\u201d Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell said.\n\nInkjet tech company XAAR (XAR.L) jumped 25% after it agreed to sell 20% of its holding in Xaar 3D to U.S. company Stratasys (SSYS.O) for $10 million.\n\nShares in small-cap N Brown (BWNG.L) skidded as much as 10% to their lowest since April after the fashion retailer said it would set aside another 20-30 million pounds in provisions relating to the mis-selling of payment protection insurance.", "description": "London's blue-chip index touched a more than one-month high on Thursday as a two-week U.S. tariff reprieve on Chinese imports lifted investor sentiment and tobacco giant BAT jumped on plans to cut 2,300 jobs.", "authors": ["Yadarisa Shabong", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428971678&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0DR", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
