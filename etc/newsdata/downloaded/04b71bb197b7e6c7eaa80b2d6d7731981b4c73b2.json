REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian/File Photo\n\nAn Argentine industry group is currently in China looking to promote the South American country\u2019s famed T-bone steaks and sirloins, while Chinese teams have recently inspected Argentine local meat plants, the sources said.\n\nThe push, after a massive spike in Argentine beef exports to the world\u2019s No. 2 economy this year, underscores how China is looking to diversify its protein supply, shaking up the global meat trade as African swine fever hammers its domestic hog herd.\n\nIt is also an important windfall for Latin America\u2019s No. 3 economy, which is battling to get out of a deep recession and facing a swirling debt crisis ahead of elections in October that will likely usher in a new government.\n\nArgentina, which traditionally exports cheaper cuts to China, saw its beef sales to the country more than double to $870 million in the first seven months of the year, data from its official INDEC statistics agency shows.\n\nChinese customs data show that amounted to around 185,604 tonnes of Argentine beef, giving it the top share of the Chinese import market with 21.7%, slightly ahead of Brazil\u2019s 21.03%. That volume was a jump of 129% against the year before.\n\nSantiago del Solar, chief of staff to Argentina\u2019s agriculture minister, told Reuters there were many slaughterhouses up for approval and that China was working closely with Argentine food safety body Senasa.\n\n\u201cWe will have news in the coming months about more pork, poultry and beef slaughterhouses being approved for China,\u201d he said, adding Senasa was doing some inspections on behalf of China using an \u201chonor system.\u201d\n\nCHINA\u2019S TIME FRAME\n\nArgentina\u2019s ranchers are now looking for more. A trade delegation is currently in China meeting with potential buyers of the country\u2019s meat, an industry official with knowledge of the meetings told Reuters.\n\nThe person added that a Chinese team had also recently traveled to Argentina to visit local meat plants.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese were there last week in Buenos Aires, they were doing inspections and made good progress. The plants issue is pretty good, but with China they make approvals when they want to do it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are optimistic with the results. It seems they didn\u2019t find anomalies, but yes, it depends on the time frame of the Chinese.\u201d\n\nThe progress comes after China granted export licenses to 25 Brazilian meatpacking plants earlier this month. Brazil has also seen a surge in meat demand from China.\n\nChina\u2019s General Administration of Customs, which approves new imports, also recently gave the green light to imports of soymeal from Argentina, following decades of talks between the two countries.\n\nThe customs body did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment from Reuters asking about new Chinese approvals for Argentine meat plants.\n\nA second person, a manager at a state-owned Chinese trading house, said he had met with an Argentine firm last week during the delegation\u2019s visit. He declined to name the firm, which had met with China customs officials, but said it had already been approved for exports and was seeking further plant approvals.\n\nMiguel Schiariti, president of the CICCRA meat industry chamber, said a Chinese team had also recently done a video-conference inspection of an Argentine plant alongside Senasa, with the aim of approving the facility for export.\n\n\u201cThere are 11 meat plants ready to be approved and (the Chinese) are doing it one by one. But approval is taking a long time,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThese places would meet the criteria for approval, but the Chinese have always been very cautious, despite the problems they have with pork. It seems to me that plants won\u2019t get approved before November.\u201d", "description": "Cattle ranchers in Argentina, which recently edged out neighbor Brazil as the top exporter of beef to China, are hoping to build on that status by getting more local meatpacking plants approved by Beijing, industry officials and other sources told Reuters.", "authors": ["Maximilian Heath", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431087345&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H09J", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
