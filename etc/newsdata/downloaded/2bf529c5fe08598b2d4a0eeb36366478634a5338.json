Arato, denied their claims: 'The Raisens are not writers of Truth Hurts.\n\nBehind the claim: Brothers Justin and Jeremiah Raisens are asking for five percent each for helping create the line, which they claim happened during a songwriting session for a different song with the 31-year-old hitmaker in April 2017\n\nSongwriting session: 'We were never contacted about being credited for the use of the parts of Healthy (melody, lyrics, and chords) that appear in Truth Hurts,' they wrote in similar Instagram posts\n\n'They did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago.'\n\nThe brothers went further and shared a video to Instagram that overlapped Lizzo's vocals from Healthy and Truth Hurts singing the line.\n\nShe sang, 'I did a DNA test and found out I'm 100% that b****,' in a strikingly similar melody - just in a different key.\n\nLizzo's camp does agree the writing session produced the 'DNA test' line. The dispute lies in who created the lyric.\n\nThe singer's representatives say she made it on her own, but the brothers say she tailored her voice to the line they created.\n\nBack in the day: Lizzo is pictured with the songwriters in the video they posted comparing her vocals on the line in Healthy and Truth Hurts\n\nThe Raisens' claim they joined the singer, Saint John and Yves Rothman to pen a track named Healthy, but they were never contacted about Healthy's music, lyrics or tempo being used.\n\nJustin said, 'It's not fair that we were not included,' adding that the brothers suffered 'emotional distress' due to the situation.\n\nThey did praise Lizzo, however, saying: 'The last thing we want to do is throw any negativity toward Lizzo\u2019s momentum and movement as a cultural figure.'\n\nTruth Hurts was made eligible for the Grammy's, despite being released two years ago, and the singer is positioned as a likely candidate for Best New Artist.\n\nLizzo was first accused of plagiarism in February 2018 by British artist Mina Lioness, who originally tweeted the line in February 2017.\n\nLegal battle: Lizzo's camp does agree the writing session produced the 'DNA test' line. The dispute lies in who created the lyric\n\nSpeaking out: Lizzo was first accused of plagiarism in February 2018 by British artist Mina Lioness, who originally tweeted the line in February 2017. She later called Lizzo's camp 'brazen'\n\nMina called out LIzzo on Twitter, saying: 'Everyone believes those were your words, when in fact they were mine. My creativity, my wit and my comedy'.\n\nHowever, Lizzo replied that she was 'inspired' by a viral meme and had never seen the tweet.\n\nThis summer, Lizzo tried to copyright the phrase '100% that bitch' to use on merchandise.\n\nIn August, Mina tweeted: 'What I cannot get over is how brazen Lizzo and her team have been in ignoring my whole presence.\n\n'They\u2019re doing it because they know I have no capital to address her. I\u2019m just the poor Black girl from London that don\u2019t have a dog in the fight.'\n\nMailOnline has contacted Lizzo's representatives for comment.", "description": "Lizzo was brushing off the drama and focusing on entertaining her fans, taking to the stage to perform during the 7th Annual We Can Survive event at The Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.", "authors": ["Kate Thomas For Mailonline", "Kellie Chudzinski For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/09/19950392-0-image-a-6_1571560318979.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
