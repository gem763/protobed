You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhile it is not confirmed what food customers will be able to fill their containers with, Asda may follow in the footsteps of Waitrose, where goods such as pasta, rice and cereal can be dispensed into containers.\n\nBy the end of 2020, Asda is aiming for a third of its own-brand plastic packaging to have been made from recycled materials.\n\nAccording to the supermarket, this measure will cut approximately 19,500 tonnes of non-recycled plastic use.\n\n\u201cThe elimination of avoidable plastic, and crucially single-use plastic, is at the top of our minds \u2013 and at the top of our customers\u2019 minds,\u201d said Roger Burnley, chief executive of Asda.\n\n\u201cOur focus is on removing unnecessary plastic, and where packaging is beneficial to the life of a product we will trial new solutions that are as recycled and as recyclable as possible.\u201d\n\nAsda stated that since February 2018, more than 6,500 tonnes of plastic packaging has been cut from its own-brand range.\n\nThe supermarket is hoping to reduce the total amount of plastic used in its own-brand packaging by 15 per cent by February 2021 and to make all its own-brand packaging recyclable by 2025.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In December 2017 Britain joined the other 193 UN countries and signed up to a resolution to help eliminate marine litter and microplastics in the sea. It is estimated that about eight million metric tons of plastic find their way into the world's oceans every year. Once in the Ocean plastic can take hundreds of years to degrade, all the while breaking down into smaller and smaller 'microplastics,' which can be consumed by marine animals, and find their way into the human food chain.

Prices will vary depending on the size of the container, with glass bottles costing 80p and large metal containers, which will be filled with things like ice cream or body lotion, will cost \u00a35.\n\nNot all products will available for purchase via Loop, but around 150 will, including some from brands such as Tropicana and Persil.\n\nIn November 2018, a study revealed that Britain's top 10 supermarkets are flooding the planet with approximately 810,000 tonnes of single-use plastic every year.\n\nWith that in mind, several supermarkets have been making stronger efforts to champion sustainability in recent years.\n\nGerman supermarket Aldi has pledged to make all its own-label packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, in June 2018 Iceland introduced a plastic bottle recycling scheme into four of its stores across the UK, whereby consumers were rewarded with a 10p voucher for every deposit.\n\nYou can read more about how UK supermarkets are tackling plastic pollution here.", "description": "Asda\u00a0is to encourage\u00a0customers to bring their own refillable containers to the supermarket in an effort to reduce use of non-recyclable plastic.
