Full support will be offered to the crew and families in the coming weeks to assist with their recovery,\u201d he added.\n\nThe company did not release the names of the crew members.\n\nIran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards seized the vessel in the Strait of Hormuz on July 19 after surrounding it with attack boats and rappelling onto its deck.\n\nIt was impounded off the port of Bandar Abbas for allegedly failing to respond to distress calls and turning off its transponder after hitting a fishing boat.\n\nSeven of its 23 crew members were released on September 4.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the tanker was \u201cunlawfully seized by Iran\u201d as part of its attempts to \u201cdisrupt freedom of navigation\u201d.\n\nGulf tensions\n\nTensions have risen in the Gulf since May last year when President Donald Trump unilaterally abandoned a 2015 nuclear deal between major powers and Iran and began reimposing crippling sanctions in a campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d.\n\nThey flared again this May when Iran began reducing its own commitments under the deal and the US deployed military assets to the region.\n\nSince then, ships have been attacked, drones downed and oil tankers seized.\n\nIn June, Trump called off air strikes against Iran at the last minute after the Islamic republic\u2019s forces shot down a US drone.\n\nThis month, twin attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure, which knocked out half the kingdom\u2019s production, drew accusations of blame not only from Washington but also from its European allies.\n\nTehran has denied any involvement in the attacks which were claimed by Iran-backed rebels fighting a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.\n\nThe US has since formed a coalition with its allies Australia, Bahrain, Britain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to escort commercial shipping in the Gulf.\n\nTehran has warned that the planned US-led International Maritime Security Construct will cause more, not less instability. It has proposed a rival security plan of its own.\n\nSpeaking at the UN General Assembly in New York, President Hassan Rouhani this week announced a plan dubbed the \u201cHormuz Peace Endeavour\u201d or \u201cHOPE\u201d.\n\nHe gave no details but called on all of Iran\u2019s Gulf neighbours to join, saying: \u201cSecurity cannot be provided with American weapons and intervention.\u201d\n\nForeign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted Thursday that the plan calls for \u201cdialogue, confidence-building, freedom of navigation, energy security, non-aggression, non-intervention\u201d.", "description": "(AFP) -- The British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero docked in Dubai on Saturday after sailing from the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas where it was held for more than two months, according to pool footage and a tracking website.", "authors": ["Breitbart London"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/tanker-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
