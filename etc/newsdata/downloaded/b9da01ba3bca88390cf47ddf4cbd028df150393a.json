The company had logged its best day in three decades on Friday after reporting strong results.\n\nNike Inc <NKE.N> advanced 1.1% after Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded the sportswear maker's stock to \"neutral\" from \"underperform.\".\n\nConstruction and engineering company AECOM <ACM.N> gained 6.3% after agreeing to sell its management services unit to private equity firms for about $2.4 billion.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.57-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 2 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 24 new highs and 123 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 4.73 billion shares, compared with the 6.86 billion average over the last 20 trading days.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Culp in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)", "description": "Wall Street edged lower on Monday as uncertainties following recent U.S.-China trade negotiations clouded sentiment and investors turned their focus on the third-quarter earnings season, which begins in earnest on Tuesday.
