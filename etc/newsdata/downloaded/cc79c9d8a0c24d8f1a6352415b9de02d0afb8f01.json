The state of Nevada is seeking the death penalty.\n\nTo avoid the death penalty, though, Martinez-Guzman will seek to the deemed \u201cintellectually disabled\u201d which would make him ineligible for the death penalty, the Associated Press reports:\n\n[Public defenders] say information gathered so far shows [Martinez-Guzman\u2019s] IQ is much lower than originally believed and that he may have been exposed to pesticides and fertilizers while working in farm fields in his native country. [Emphasis added] \u201cBased on the investigation to date, there is a good faith basis to believe that Mr. Guzman is ineligible for the death penalty because he may be intellectually disabled. There could be no greater insult to public justice that to execute someone that as a matter of law is ineligible for capital punishment,\u201d Washoe County Public Defender John Arrascada wrote in the Oct. 4 motion. [Emphasis added]\n\nSo far, prosecutors have said there is not enough evidence to rule out the death penalty for Martinez-Guzman. The illegal alien\u2019s attorneys are looking to have the trial moved to February 2021 despite the current trial date of April 2020.\n\nIllegal aliens charged with murder have routinely been using the \u201cintellectually disabled\u201d defense to avoid being put to death. In the case of illegal alien gang member Apolinar Altamirano, who allegedly murdered 21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck in January 2015, was able to be deemed \u201cintellectually disabled\u201d in order to avoid the death penalty.\n\nAmong those allegedly murdered by Martinez-Guzman was Connie Koontz, a mother, whose mother\u2019s 80th birthday was the following day. Koontz, herself, was set to turn 57 five days after her murder. A GoFundMe page has been created to help the Koontz family in the wake of her murder.\n\nAlso allegedly murdered was 74-year-old Sophia Renken, as well as Gerald and Sharon David, who were both beloved members of the South Reno community. Gerald was president of the Reno Rodeo Association in 2006 and Sharon was a member of the group.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
