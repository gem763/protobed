Eurydice, played by Mary Bevan, is imprisoned in a celestial boudoir while the gods jostle to have their wicked way with her. Within minutes, the captivating heroine is frolicking on a bed \u2013 with a fly. She is rapturously unaware that the insect is Jupiter\u2019s alter ego, and that the god is looming lustfully over her. \u201cWhen I wiggle my bum, my little wings begin to hum,\u201d sings Willard White as the uber-deity, with a pert little shimmy of his hips.\n\nIt\u2019s all very silly but also more than a little bit creepy, not least because Jupiter looks old enough to be Eurydice\u2019s grandfather. Given that the fly is a puppet that buzzes around on the end of a stick, it\u2019s also very Emma Rice. But is it Offenbach? That is the question opera-goers will be asking as they head to English National Opera for this second instalment of a season investigating the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.\n\nRice answers the question of faithfulness with two words: \u201cWhich text?\u201d After agreeing to take on the production, the director found herself with nine different versions on CD. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a definitive text. Offenbach himself did a two-act version and a four-act one, and there have been many other interpretations, so what I didn\u2019t have was a clear starting point. I was thinking, \u2018Bloody hell, how do I get through this?\u2019 It would be easier if I knew how to read a score.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emma Rice: \u2018I started restructuring a narrative I could believe in\u2019 Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer\n\nRice took her anxieties off on holiday with her partner, and together they managed to track down an old libretto in the original French. \u201cSo we decided to Google Translate it.\u201d But far from solving the problem, it was immediately clear that what they had found wasn\u2019t fit for her purposes.\n\nWe decided to Google Translate the libretto. I was horrified by some of the words I found. There was a lot of non-consensual love\n\nOffenbach, she explains, created his celebrated operetta partly as a riposte to the longueurs of romantic opera. Far from being a star-crossed lover, his violin-playing Orpheus can\u2019t wait to get rid of Eurydice, who hates his music and is only too happy to console herself with a shepherd. \u201cI was quite horrified by some of the words I found there,\u201d says Rice. \u201cThere was a lot of non-consensual love and it began with a marriage that\u2019s entirely loveless. It certainly wasn\u2019t something I had much connection with, so I started restructuring it into a narrative I could believe in.\u201d\n\nThis won\u2019t surprise long-term followers of Rice\u2019s career. Though a newcomer to opera, she has long been a controversial figure in UK theatre, revered and derided with equal fervour. She made her name with the Cornish touring company Kneehigh, whose philosophy of \u201cjoyful anarchy\u201d landed her in trouble more than once in big institutions, not least while director of Shakespeare\u2019s Globe. Two seasons in, she resigned after a high-profile falling-out with its board over her insistence on being allowed to do her own thing, using stage lighting and amplified sound in contravention of the theatre\u2019s founding principles.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Orpheus can\u2019t wait to get rid of Eurydice \u2013 and she hates the violin Photograph: ENO\n\nOpinions were split between those who felt she was wrecking the Globe and others who argued that, in rejecting her vision, the venue had proved itself not so much a theatre as \u201cpart of the heritage industry and a plaything for academic researchers\u201d. Rice responded with an impassioned open letter, writing: \u201cI chose to leave because, as important and beloved as the Globe is to me, the board did not love and respect me back. It did not understand what I saw, what I felt and what I created with my actors, creative teams and the audience.\u201d\n\nThough ENO audiences are yet to pass judgment, it\u2019s clear her cast and creative team are having fun. It is the final week of rehearsals, and the script is still evolving. Music ricochets around the room and, in every break, she scurries back to her laptop to tap in dialogue changes in consultation with whichever performer has suggested them. \u201cShe\u2019s created real characters for us mortals,\u201d says Ed Lyon, whose Orpheus has been gifted with an unprecedented reprisal of an aria in the final act. \u201cPartly,\u201d says Rice, \u201cto give him more to sing, but also to celebrate the love story.\u201d\n\nHer first decision, she says, was that Orpheus and Eurydice were going to love each other. For that, she had to create a context for their current disenchantment, so she introduced a dumbshow prologue suggesting a domestic tragedy. \u201cBy the end of the overture, they\u2019re so sad that their marriage has broken down, but all the music is unchanged \u2013 and Eurydice still hates the violin.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Up and away: the promotional image for the opera Photograph: -\n\nRice has set the show in the 1950s, sidestepping Offenbach\u2019s political satire \u2013 beyond \u201cvery gently referencing #MeToo\u201d by emphasising the predatory nature of Jupiter, and modelling Public Opinion, the choric figure who militates for the reunion of the lovers, on a London cab driver. She has reordered scenes and enlisted her longstanding collaborator Tom Morris to rewrite the lyrics. \u201cThere are lots of puppet bees and balloon sheep, but I haven\u2019t come in saying \u2013 how can I make it an Emma Rice opera?\u2019 I feel humble. I was going to say I\u2019m flying by the seat of my pants, but I should be diplomatic and say I\u2019m watching with interest.\u201d\n\nAt 52, Rice is an effervescent presence who looks like she\u2019s just tumbled out of a theatre wardrobe, with her silver-blond hair whipped up like a slightly melting vanilla ice cream. She has arrived at ENO flushed with the success of Malory Towers, the second production of her new theatre company Wise Children \u2013 named after the Angela Carter novel it made its debut with. But she doesn\u2019t make light of the trauma of her Globe bust-up, saying: \u201cI\u2019m OK now, but the upset probably took two years to get over. It\u2019s like other griefs and losses: you gradually begin to realise, \u2018I didn\u2019t think of it today.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch a trailer for the production\n\nDoes she see a new career opening up for her in opera? \u201cI\u2019m determined to see the whole process out, but I\u2019m a theatre-maker. I\u2019ve never done TV, film or opera before, I just see and think in theatre, so there\u2019s no power grab going on. On the other hand, the Coliseum is double the size of the biggest theatre I\u2019ve worked, which is thrilling because I\u2019ve got a big old vision.\u201d She sure has: for the Gallop Infernal, more than 50 Soho sleazebags will rise from tables in a shady underworld nightclub to dance the famous can-can number.\n\nOne novelty, for a director with a background in collaborative music theatre, will be the need to hand the production over in its final stages to conductor Sian Edwards because, in opera, the music always comes first. Rice is not sure how easy that will be: \u201cI\u2019m possibly more of a control freak than I think I am. My friends tease me, saying: \u2018Do it any way you like \u2013 but not like that.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s all part of an invigorating new chapter for Rice. \u201cI\u2019ve loved being in my 50s,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it felt narratively perfect to say that, at this stage in my life, I have a clean slate and I\u2019m going to do something with everything I\u2019ve learned.\u201d The key is to never look back.\n\n\u2022 Orpheus in the Underworld is in rep at the London Coliseum, 5 October to 28 November.", "description": "Three years since she was fired from Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, the director has bounced back with Offenbach\u2019s Orpheus in the Underworld \u2013 a riotous epic stuffed with puppet bees, lecherous flies and romantic cabbies", "authors": ["Claire Armitstead"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d448ca3078aa2d14793652c864f924317b76ea8c/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9d88c629c4638d44a88b3500f40f4be5", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
