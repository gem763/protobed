Two humiliating defeats inside five days, 10 goals conceded and the loss of their first-choice goalkeeper and captain for the next few months, never mind the loss of face. It is not a good look.\n\nLosing 7-2 at home to European giants Bayern Munich\u2019s is one thing, but failing to respond with any sort of defiance, determination or spirit against Brighton is more disturbing, and Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s body language said as much as his words after this humbling 3-0 defeat.\n\nBrighton, who started the day with only five goals in seven games and without a home win in eight league games, should have been ideal opponents for Tottenham\u2019s players to send out the message that they were ready to bounce back from that beating by Bayern and show their mettle.\n\nThey did, indeed, show what they were made of, and for Pochettino and the club\u2019s fans, it made uncomfortable viewing.\n\nFrom the third minute of the match, when Hugo Lloris produced another howler, which resulted in a simple opening goal for Neal Maupay and a dislocated elbow for the French goalkeeper, Spurs were second best and architects of their own downfall.", "description": "Where do Tottenham go from here?", "authors": ["Gerry Cox", "Luke Edwards", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212071057-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq_KtF028LHv1eGAuWEQSnQ7I6W6ISK65HAp5yEPKK6C0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
