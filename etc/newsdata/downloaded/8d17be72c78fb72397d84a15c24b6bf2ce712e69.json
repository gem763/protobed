Ambulances and religious pilgrims were also excluded.\n\nSecurity forces blocked major roads and bridges. Access to the internet was also limited, making it harder to organise protests on social media.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Protesters took to the streets of Baghdad on Thursday despite the open-ended curfew\n\nBut thousands of protesters gathered in and around Tahrir Square - the focus of the recent unrest - prompting riot police to fire tear gas and shots in the air to disperse them.\n\n\"We'll keep going until the government falls,\" Ali, a 22-year-old unemployed university graduate, told AFP.\n\n\"I've got nothing but 250 lira ($0.20; \u00a30.16) in my pocket while government officials have millions.\"\n\nMore from Iraq:\n\nViolence has been concentrated in Baghdad and in the majority Shia Muslim areas of the south. Northern Kurdish regions and Sunni-majority areas in the west remain mostly calm.\n\nOn Thursday, police and hospital sources told Reuters that protesters had been killed in the capital, and also in and around the southern cities of Amara, Diwaniya, Hilla and Nassiriya, among others. Hundreds have been wounded.\n\nOvernight on Wednesday, explosions were heard in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, where government offices and foreign embassies are located.\n\nThe US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group in Iraq said none of its facilities were hit and that Iraqi security forces were investigating the blasts.\n\nWhat triggered the unrest?\n\nThe protests appear to be the result of a spontaneous upwelling of frustration at Iraq's high youth unemployment rate, its dire public services and chronic corruption.\n\nSimona Foltyn, a journalist based in Baghdad, told the BBC's World Update programme: \"The demonstrators I have spoken to so far have said that these protests are a grassroots movement, comprised of a variety of people - men, women, graduates, the unemployed, the elderly - who are all airing grievances that have accumulated over the past years.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Protesters and security forces face off in Najaf\n\n\"They have all denied the involvement of any political party. They are, in fact, extremely disenfranchised and disappointed with the political establishment here.\"\n\nShe added: \"All of the people who are protesting seem to be united in one thing: they want a better life. They want services, they want jobs, and they want living standards to go up.\"\n\nLast year, the southern Iraqi city of Basra was rocked by weeks of protests over unsafe drinking water, power shortages, unemployment and corruption. Government offices, including the main provincial council building, were set alight.\n\nWhat is the economic situation like in Iraq?\n\nIraq has the fourth-largest reserves of oil, but 22.5% of its population of 40 million were living on less than $1.90 (\u00a31.53) a day in 2014, according to the World Bank. One in six households has experienced some form of food insecurity.\n\nThe unemployment rate was 7.9% last year, but among young people it was double that. And almost 17% of the economically active population is underemployed.\n\nUnemployment in Iraq Modelled ILO estimates, %\n\nThe country is also struggling to recover after a brutal war against the Islamic State group, which seized control of large swathes of the north and west in 2014.\n\nThe Iraqi government and World Bank estimated last year that $88bn (\u00a371bn) was needed to fund short- and medium-term reconstruction.\n\nJust over one million people are still internally displaced, while 6.7 million are in need of humanitarian assistance, the UN says. Living conditions are dire in many conflict-affected areas, with insufficient basic services.", "description": "Mr Mahdi tells protesters \"your voice was heard\", as the country reels from days of unrest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07q0spr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
