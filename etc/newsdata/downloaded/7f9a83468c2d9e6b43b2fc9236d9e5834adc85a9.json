The quake also triggered power cuts in nearby General Santos city, media said.\n\nSome schools in the area have suspended classes.\n\nDuterte's office has called for calm as it mobilized all government agencies to undertake damage assessment and to coordinate rescue and relief operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Bernadette Baum)", "description": "The 6.6 magnitude quake hit early on Tuesday, damaging buildings, toppling power lines and triggering landslides in the central area of the Philippines' southern island.
