The Trump administration\u2019s purposeful cruelty has been widely documented and rightly condemned, but it appears the depths of Donald Trump\u2019s indecency go even further than many could have ever imagined. Frustrated with a record number of people seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border earlier this year, Trump is said to have asked close aides whether or not the US could shoot migrants below the waist to slow them down.\n\nMoreover, he spoke of the construction of a snake and alligator-filled moat in addition to an electric wall that could shock people daring to cross it (along with spikes that could pierce human flesh). And I suppose, if all else fails, that\u2019s when he would like border control officials to shoot migrants in the leg.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe claims were first reported in a book excerpt released by the New York Times on Tuesday. ABC News has reported similar claims, noting that Trump\u2019s aides discouraged the idea of shooting unarmed migrants and it was never acted upon only for him to bring it up again later.\n\nIn response, Trump wrote on Twitter: \u201cNow the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!\u201d\n\nTrump offered another denial during a bizarre (even by his standards) joint appearance with Finnish president Sauli Niinist\u00f6 in which Niinist\u00f6 said very little. But, given Trump\u2019s lifelong battle against telling the truth, is there any reason to take him at his word now? After all, this is a man who deems it appropriate to separate children from their parents and lock them up in cages \u2014 who had already publicly suggested shooting migrants about a year ago.\n\nAs despicable as Trump sounds, though, there is a bit of twisted irony here.\n\nAs Crooked Media\u2019s Jon Favreau, who served as Director of Speechwriting for President Barack Obama, reminds us, many of Trump\u2019s ideas for heightened border security were once joked about by the then-president.\n\nIn 2011, Obama complained about Republicans\u2019 refusal to engage in comprehensive immigration reform legislation. \"We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement,\" Obama said. \"But even though we've answered these concerns, I gotta say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time.\"\n\n\"Maybe they'll need a moat,\" Obama continued mockingly to an amused crowd. \"Maybe they'll want alligators in the moat.\"\n\nMaybe.\n\nWhat was funny at the time is frightening now. There is reason to be grateful that Trump\u2019s incredibly stupid ideas for deterring migrants along the Mexican border were shut down, but that doesn\u2019t outweigh the underlying barbarity of Trump\u2019s mindset.\n\nI am not a psychiatrist, so it is not my place to dole out a diagnosis to Trump. However, as a decent human being, I can surmise that only someone disturbed would find it appropriate to sic snakes, alligators, human flesh-piercing spikes, and bullets on desperate people merely seeking sanctuary \u2014 mainly from nations harmed by US meddling.\n\nI understand how desensitizing Trump\u2019s rhetoric can become due to repetition, but we cannot allow ourselves to get used to the president of the United States suggesting that some of the most vulnerable people walking the earth be shot down like dogs or eaten alive by alligators for simply looking for a better life in a country Trump seems to believe belongs to white people. This report should have brought our nation still. And yet, like so many other heinous words and actions from this administration, it\u2019s lost in the ever-expanding chaos. By design, no doubt.\n\nA day after Trump\u2019s despicable previous requests were made public, Buzzfeed News reported that Trump\u2019s Department of Justice has drafted a regulation that would place a two-month deadline for unaccompanied children to apply for asylum with US Citizenship and Immigration Services officials. Presently, there is no timeline for children to file an application. Worse, the DOJ regulation would also \u201cinstruct immigration judges to determine whether an individual appearing before them claiming to be an unaccompanied minor and requesting asylum is in fact qualified to be labeled as such.\u201d\n\nIn a similar vein, NBC News has revealed that less than a week after saying that \u201cnon-citizens\u201d could be served by a program designed to grant housing to human trafficking victims, the Trump administration abruptly delayed a $13.5m grant that funds it.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

wonder how much crueler will it get \u2014 especially if Trump somehow manages to extend his run as president another four years. He can\u2019t shoot migrants, but he can lock the youngest of them in cages; he can let those victims of the most exploitative crimes go without housing until presumably, ICE sends them back to the very places that placed them in such a dire predicament; he can let them stay stuck in perpetual purgatory in a glorified concentration camp.\n\nHe keeps upping the ante and he won\u2019t stop unless he is taken on and taken down.\n\nTrump\u2019s behavior warrants exorcism as much as it does impeachment. If he ends up reelected, he will feel newly empowered \u2014 and I shudder to think what \u201cnot the right people\u201d will have to deal with then.", "description": "When Donald Trump declared his bid for the presidency, he did so with outwardly racist contempt of Mexican migrants to the US, using a litany of gross stereotypes which culminated with the unforgettable sentence: \u201cThey\u2019re sending us not the right people.\u201d", "authors": ["Michael Arceneaux"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/18/1173107123.jpg"}
