Patrick Casey pleaded guilty Tuesday to aggravated assault. He was accused of engaging in sex acts with a younger man who was struggling with his Catholic faith and homosexuality and had sought Casey\u2019s counsel in 2013.\n\nThe maximum penalty is a year in jail.\n\nCasey at the time was a priest in Westland. TV station WXYZ reports that a Wayne County jury was deadlocked during deliberations Monday. Casey had been charged with third-degree criminal sexual conduct, a felony.\n\nThe Detroit Archdiocese says it learned about the allegations in 2015 and banned Casey from any form of church ministry.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Catholic priest has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor after a Detroit-area jury said it was having trouble reaching a unanimous verdict in his sexual abuse trial.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/06/04/the_reckoning_the_cardinal_92668_c0-452-5400-3600_s1770x1032.jpg?0a07f652290b2f8189fed5416d71767d775db690", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
