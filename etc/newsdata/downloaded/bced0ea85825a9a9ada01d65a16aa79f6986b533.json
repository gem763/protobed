She and her husband, who owns a minibus are gradually buying their own home. \u201cI never dreamed we would be able to buy a house,\u201d she says.\n\nSuch changes are evident everywhere across Bolivia, the work of a government that has invested profits from a commodity boom into infrastructure and social programs.\n\nBut as the October 20th national elections approach, enthusiasm for this government is tempered by ambivalence. President Evo Morales, is seeking an unprecedented fourth term after 13 years in power, and in a country with long periods of authoritarian rule, the possibility of another re-election makes many nervous.\n\n'Murderer of nature': Evo Morales blamed as Bolivia battles devastating fires Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that Evo\u2019s been in power too long,\u201d said hotel worker Juan Rivero in Santa Cruz. \u201cBut at the same time, this government has done a lot for us.\u201d\n\nUntil recent disastrous wildfires, it seemed likely that Morales\u2019 re-election was inevitable. But the slow government response to the fires which devastated more than 4m hectares (9.9m acres) of forest and arable land provoked large demonstrations in the cities of Santa Cruz, Cochabamba and La Paz in early October.\n\nProtesters also expressed anger over Morales\u2019s efforts to remain in office, despite a previous pledge to leave at the end of his third term as stipulated by Bolivia\u2019s 2009 constitution. That commitment came immediately after he narrowly lost a February 2016 referendum his government called on whether he could stand again.\n\nA year and a half later, the country\u2019s Supreme Electoral Tribunal \u2013 chosen by a legislative assembly dominated by Morales\u2019 party \u2013 ruled that denying his candidacy was an infringement of his human rights.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Indigenous people arrive in Santa Cruz on Wednesay as they march demanding Morales declare the Chiquitania region a disaster zone due to forest fires.

Bolivia now has the world\u2019s second highest number of women legislators and thirty-six indigenous languages are now officially recognized.\n\nEvo for ever? Bolivia scraps term limits as critics blast 'coup' to keep Morales in power Read more\n\n\u201cDemocracy has two faces in Bolivia,\u201d explains political scientist Fernando Mayorga. \u201cUndoubtedly, there has been a concentration of power in the government\u2019s party, but representative capacity and citizen participation have also expanded.\u201d\n\nMorales\u2019 rivals, drawn from the fragmented center-to- right opposition, have taken advantage of public outrage over the fires. A poll ten days before the election showed former president and vice-president Carlos Mesa\u2019s projected share of the vote had risen to 26.9% while Evo\u2019s has dropped to 36.2%.\n\nBut \u2013 in a reflection of the fluidity of the race \u2013 a subsequent poll showed 40% for Morales to Mesa\u2019s 22%. Without a majority, the candidate with the most votes must win 40% of the vote with a 10-point margin to prevail in the first round.\n\nThe narrowing gap between Morales and Mess indicates that a runoff is a strong possibility.\n\nMuch depends on the most unpredictable voting segment: urban youth. Half the population is under 25, and they are more urban, educated, and middle class than their parents\u2019 generation. Most of them have never known any government except one led by Evo.\n\nKey to Morales\u2019 ongoing support are the pragmatic economic policies that have made Bolivia the regional leader in economic growth, despite the collapse of the commodity boom in 2014. From 2006 to 2018, GDP per capita grew from $1,000 to over $3,600, according to the Inter-American Development Bank.\n\nBut how long the economic good times will continue to roll is unclear however.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Supporters of President Evo Morales perform at a closing campaign rally in El Alto, on the outskirts of La Paz, Bolivia, Wednesday.

This outlay fueled an economic boom. Brand-new construction and cars, bustling markets and conspicuous consumption have flourished like never before.\n\nThe minimum wage gradually doubled in constant terms (even though enforcement is scant) and the government mandated two year-end bonuses (instead of the usual one), stipulating that 15% of it be spent on locally-made goods.\n\nHow a populist president helped Bolivia's poor \u2013 but built himself a palace Read more\n\nConditional cash transfers, adopted widely throughout Latin America, have delivered a small stipend to the elderly, pregnant women and children who remained in school, contributing to cutting of overall poverty in half.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to live on,\u201d said an elderly Cochabamba man, \u201cbut my wife gets it too and it covers our food costs. That\u2019s a big help.\u201d\n\nThe funding for these programs stems from expanding mining, hydrocarbons exploration, soy production and cattle ranching \u2013 often financed by Chinese state capital.\n\nAs a consequence, deforestation in eastern Bolivia has doubled since 2015, driven largely by growing cattle raising and soy production.\n\nOver its 13 years in power, Morales\u2019 government has moved steadily towards the center with little programmatic differences between it and the opposition. Pro-Morales election billboards promise \u201ca secure future\u201d foregrounding stability rather than the profound change he originally pledged.\n\nJuanita Flores, the vegetable-seller from La Paz voted for Evo in past elections, but this time she\u2019s not sure who she\u2019ll choose. \u201cI worry that his government is becoming more corrupt \u2013 and that he\u2019s been in power too long,\u201d she said.\n\n", "description": "Government has invested in infrastructure and social programs, but critics fear \u2018the end of democracy\u2019 if Morales wins", "authors": ["Linda Farthing In La Paz"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5e932d11dff28cf3eb9d706c32c67f91e3d5ed/0_264_4228_2536/master/4228.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57ef03c4f0c9dfa45b321ee58b073d53", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
