And what will it mean for the future of Cain and his estranged wife Moira (Natalie J Robb)?\n\nWhile no announcement has been made that Cara is being cast or there is an arrival planned, viewers are surmising that there is a long way to go with this story and it would be a wasted opportunity to start this storyline without exploring it fully \u2013 especially as it has cost us the Coira partnership.\n\nAt the moment, Cain detests Nate and can\u2019t accept him as his blood, seeing as Nate rocked up filled with hate and ideas of revenge and deliberately set out to seduce Moira. With an affair following, Cain\u2019s life and marriage are in ruins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Nate isn\u2019t particularly keen on Cain either seeing as he feels abandoned by his long lost dad \u2013 who he has been brought up thinking never wanted anything to do with him. He has since learned that Cain didn\u2019t actually know he existed thanks to the interference of Faith (Sally Dexter) but there are still a lot of unresolved feelings.\n\nNate has kept it to himself where Cara is right now and what her life is like but it seems likely that she may well turn up in Emmerdale \u2013 given their history and the fact that they have a son together, could she end up reuniting with Cain? Stranger things have happened\u2026\n\nAnd a reunion for Cain and Moira certainly seems off the cards as next week will see Cain get rid of his wedding ring, shattering Moira\u2019s hopes that there is any chance of them sorting things out.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Happy families?", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cain-dingle-and-nate-robinson-in-emmerdale_1572014858.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
