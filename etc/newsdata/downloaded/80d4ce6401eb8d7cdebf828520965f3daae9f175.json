Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Saturday that it\u2019s time for the U.S. to weigh an attack on Iranian oil refineries if the nation continues its \u201cprovocations.\u201d He warned that such a raid would \u201cbreak the regime\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nGraham raised the possibility of U.S. military action following drone attacks early Saturday on a massive oil field and the world\u2019s largest oil producing facility in Saudi Arabia that disrupted 50% of Saudi oil output \u2014 and 5% of the global supply.\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have taken responsibility for the bombings amid a war led by the Saudis against the Iranian-backed Houthis. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saturday that Iran was responsible.\n\nIran will not stop their misbehavior until the consequences become more real, like attacking their refineries, which will break the regime\u2019s back. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 14, 2019\n\nIt is now time for the U.S. to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries if they continue their provocations or increase nuclear enrichment. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 14, 2019\n\nPompeo said in a tweet Saturday that \u201cTehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy,\u201d referring to Iran\u2019s president Hassan Rouhani and his foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. \u201cAmid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy,\u201d he added.\n\nTehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy. Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen. \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) September 14, 2019\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who\u2019s currently trying to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, just last week suggested lifting some American sanctions against Iran \u2014 and had talked of meeting soon with Rouhani.\n\nThe Daily Beast reported that Trump was also considering giving Iran a $15 billion line of credit if the nation would comply with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Trump withdrew from the agreement last year, and Iran has since decided not to comply with the pact. NBC said Saturday that former national security adviser John Bolton quit the administration Tuesday because he strongly opposed lifting any sanctions against Tehran.\n\nThe president called Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman Saturday to offer support for the nation\u2019s \u201cself defense,\u201d according to the White House. It wasn\u2019t clear what that might entail. The White House also said in a statement that the U.S. \u201cremains committed to ensuring global oil markets are stable and well supplied.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut lashed Pompeo\u2019s assessment of the attack on Saudi oil as simplistic. \u201cThe Saudis and Houthis are at war,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThe Saudis attack the Houthis and the Houthis attack back. Iran is backing the Houthis and has been a bad actor, but it\u2019s just not as simple as Houthis = Iran.\u201d\n\nThis is such irresponsible simplification and it\u2019s how we get into dumb wars of choice\n\n\n\nThe Saudis and Houthis are at war. The Saudis attack the Houthis and the Houthis attack back. Iran is backing the Houthis and has been a bad actor, but it\u2019s just not as simple as Houthis=Iran. https://t.co/BFiO1AQe2B \u2014 Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 14, 2019", "description": "\"Iran will not stop their misbehavior until the consequences become more real,\" the senator said after a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7d61e03b0000c49fd37080.jpeg?cache=zlwmzllr3b&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
