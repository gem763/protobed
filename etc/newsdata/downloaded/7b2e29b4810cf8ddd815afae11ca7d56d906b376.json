The decision was the latest sign that extracting the US military from Syria is more uncertain and complicated than Donald Trump has made it out to be.\n\nOn Saturday, there were several troop movements in Syria as the various players adjusted to the US decision to withdraw troops from the north-east.\n\nA US convoy of more than a dozen vehicles was spotted driving south of the north-eastern city of Qamishli, likely heading to the oil-rich Deir el-Zour area where there are oil fields, or possibly to another base nearby.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor also reported the convoy, saying it arrived earlier from Iraq.\n\nThe seizure and control of oil fields in eastern Syria \u2026 is, quite simply, international state banditry Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov\n\nA large convoy of Syrian government troops was also spotted heading toward the M4 highway. The Syrian state news agency Sana said troops had entered the region of Ras al-Ayn, deploying to eight villages along the highway and up near the Syrian-Turkish border.\n\nThe Observatory called Saturday\u2019s deployment of Syrian forces the largest in the area in nearly seven years.\n\nSyrian government troops had not set foot in north-eastern Syria since 2012, when the government pulled out to focus on the war elsewhere in Syria. Kurdish forces took control of the area and allied with the US to fight Isis militants.\n\nBut after Trump ordered his forces to withdraw from Kurdish-held areas, allowing for a Turkish offensive launched on 9 October, Syrian Kurdish forces turned to Russia and Damascus for protection. The government deployment began in mid-October.\n\nA separate deal between Turkey and Russia accelerated Syrian government deployment as joint Russian-Syrian patrols are part of the new border arrangements.\n\nBut Russia was critical that Washington will continue to keep troops in Syria. The foreign ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov said \u201cwhat Washington is doing now, the seizure and control of oil fields in eastern Syria under its armed control, is, quite simply, international state banditry.\n\n\u201cAll hydrocarbon deposits and other minerals located on the territory of Syria do not belong to the [Isis] terrorists, and even less to the \u2018American defenders from Isis terrorists,\u2019 but exclusively to the Syrian Arab Republic.\n\n\u201cThe real cause of this illegal action by the United States in Syria lies far from the ideals that Washington has proclaimed and from the slogans of fighting terrorism,\u201d Konashenkov said.\n\nAfter ordering his troops home, Trump said he would leave up to 300 in southern Syria before Esper announced that another residual force was being considered in south-eastern Syria to protect oil fields.\n\nThe Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, spoke by telephone on Saturday about Syria.\n\n\u201cFrom the Russian side, the necessity was emphasized of refraining from steps undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that county,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.", "description": "US convoy observed driving south from city of Qamishli after Donald Trump had said US troops would leave war-torn Syria", "authors": ["Associated Press In Moscow"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e01a4167161f36cd0c6eb0c51096d7e180d70da/0_205_3397_2038/master/3397.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=64df17bb2d050addae835c4322534450", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
