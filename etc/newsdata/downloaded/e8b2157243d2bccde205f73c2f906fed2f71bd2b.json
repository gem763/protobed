Add Animals as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Animals news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nScott Poore has been living with a 3-year-old terrier mix named Queen at the Great Plains SPCA in Merriam, Kansas since Tuesday, but plans to stay for however long it takes.\n\nHe hopes by living with her, and bringing attention to her story, Queen will have an easier time getting adopted.\n\nKMBC\n\n\"I\u2019m gonna stay here until we find her not just a home, but the perfect home,\" Poore said in a Facebook video announcing his decision to move into the shelter.\n\n\"She wants a best human friend,\" he said. \"It\u2019s all about Queen.\"\n\nQueen has been living at the shelter for more than 400 days, the longest of animal any there, and, according to Poore, hasn\u2019t had the easiest upbringing. She was found living behind a dumpster in \"a terrible area.\"\n\nKMBC\n\nBut since living at the shelter, she\u2019s received the appropriate medical care and is ready to move in with a family.\n\n\"She's the world's sweetest dog,\" Poore told ABC News on Thursday. \"She's not aggressive. She's not mean.\"\n\nPoore said the perfect home would, ideally, have no other dogs and no small children.\n\nHe can't figure out exactly why she's not getting adopted, but thinks it could be \"a freak situation after a string of bad luck.\"\n\nKMBC\n\nWhile he's well-aware that people want him to take in Queen, he has no plans to adopt her.\n\n\"Everybody wants me to but everybody who knows me knows this is what I do,\" he said. \"I've got a dog at home that's very special to me and I bring a different dog home every night from the shelter, so I've got a great system.\"\n\n\"I'm in the business of exporting, not importing,\" Poore added.\n\nHe hopes a generous soul will come forward soon because the shelter life has been weighing on Queen, like it does most animals.\n\n\"She's just been slowly declining in the shelter environment because I see her every day I\u2019ve noticed those changes,\" Poore told ABC Kansas City affiliate KMBC. \"Queen is really speaking for all long term shelter dogs and shelter cats, they\u2019re kind of the forgotten ones.\"", "description": "A Kansas City man has moved in with a shelter dog in an effort to help her get adopted.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/shelter-dog-kmbc-ht-ml-190919_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
