Where factional observance has to be adhered to completely.\n\n\"And it completely goes against the sort of traditions that the Labour Party has had for 100 years.\"\n\nHe added that he felt that Momentum's founder Mr Lansman \"and his faction\" were so angry about his position on Brexit they would \"rather abolish me than have a debate about it\".\n\nHe appealed to Momentum activists to focus on showing people they were serious about changing the political economy of Britain rather than having \"a sort of sleight-of-hand constitutional change to do a drive-by shooting of someone you disagree with\".\n\nThe Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP), which represents Labour backbenchers, has written a letter to members of the National Executive Committee - including Jeremy Corbyn - saying the move is counterproductive and sends the country a message \"we are more interested in internal battles\" than constituents' lives.\n\nFormer Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair said abolishing the deputy leader post would be \"undemocratic and politically dangerous\".\n\n'Outdated rulebook'\n\nAsked if he thought the move had been made by Mr Corbyn himself, Mr Watson said \"I don't know\", but added his leader had the power to stop it.\n\nHe defended his role, saying he had been elected by party members and they could trigger an election themselves if they wanted to remove him rather than making a secret move at a last-minute meeting.\n\n\"These kinds of things happen in Venezuela, they shouldn't be happening in the United Kingdom,\" he said.\n\nMr Watson has urged Labour to \"unequivocally back remain\" and had said he wants another public vote on the UK's membership of the EU before any general election.\n\nBut Mr Corbyn wants to hold another referendum once Labour has won power, in which voters would have the choice to remain in the EU alongside a \"credible\" Leave proposal.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption Jeremy Corbyn has the power to stop the move, says Mr Watson\n\nA Momentum source told the BBC: \"We just can't afford to go into an election with a deputy leader set on wrecking Labour's chances.\n\n\"Labour members overwhelmingly want a deputy leadership election, but our outdated rulebook won't let it happen.\"\n\nDawn Butler, shadow women and equalities secretary, said Momentum's move had \"come out of the blue\" but she could understand the frustration with the deputy leader.\n\nAsked if Mr Watson was doing the job well, she said: \"I have my frustrations with Tom too. I haven't seen him at a shadow cabinet meeting for a while.\"\n\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says Momentum's move \"was not discussed\" among its governing body - adding there was \"anger\" at Mr Lansman as this was \"not an official decision\".\n\nEx-PM Tony Blair, who led Labour from 1994 to 2007, said abolishing the deputy deader post suggested an \"extraordinary level of destructive sectarianism\".\n\nHe said the party has always contained different views and the deputy leader's position had been one way of accommodating such views.\n\n\"Getting rid of it would be a signal that such pluralism of views was coming to an end despite being cherished throughout Labour's history,\" he said.\n\nFormer party leader Ed Miliband said whoever came up with the idea had \"taken leave of their senses\".\n\nLabour MP Wes Streeting called it \"outrageous\" and \"self-destructive\", while his colleague Jess Phillips said it was part of a desperate attempt to control and expel anyone in the party who has an independent thought.", "description": "Tom Watson says an attempt to abolish his post is a \"sectarian attack\" on the party's \"broad church\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nz9bd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
