I couldn\u2019t say it back, despite my ever-present, people-pleasing tendencies. I hugged him, and said \u201cThank you\u201d. Probably the worst-ever time to be courteous.\n\nREAD MORE: Here\u2019s why older women dating younger men is still seen as taboo, plus what leads to breakups in such relationships\n\nAs the years progressed, I sensed a pattern. After dating a guy for about three months, boom! \u201cI love you\u201d. Always from his lips to my face. Never the other way around. This might have something to do with my 13-year-old self, and my mom telling me to never let a boy dump me. Since that day, this fear of ever being rejected, haunted me. Reject away, no problem! But girls don\u2019t get rejected.\n\nTelling a guy that you love him first, and him potentially thanking you, an abomination in \u2018girl world\u2019 terms.\n\n\u201cSociety has placed a burden on people by over rating these three words. It adds so much unnecessary pressure to a situation. It symbolises certain feelings we long for: to feel safe, contained and secure. To feel less lonely and less anxious,\u201d says Marlene Wasserman, a clinical sexologist and couple\u2019s therapist at Dr. Eve.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018I went on a tinder date with a couple and we spent the night together\u2019 \u2014 here\u2019s how this local woman\u2019s unique experience went\n\nWith my last partner, I wanted to tell him a few times. I walked around holding in this big secret that I was dying to spill. But I put a verbal block on my feelings, and refused to allow myself to say it first. I knew I loved him, but I wasn\u2019t sure he loved me\u2026 yet.\n\nWe put an unnecessary expiry date on everything. Three months = love. Some people take longer to mature. You don\u2019t want an \u201cI love you\u201d that\u2019s out of obligation. That almost means less than nothing.\n\nREAD MORE: More couples are meeting online than in real life, here\u2019s why hiring a matchmaker is an alternative to swiping through Tinder profiles\n\nYou want to feel that the love is real, otherwise it\u2019s like being gifted a voucher for Christmas. You know it\u2019s a gift, but you can\u2019t feel the love.\n\nIn movies we see men surprising women with an \u201cI love you\u201d all the time. But what has always bothered me is the way in which women reciprocate the gesture. Like she\u2019s been holding it in for so long she\u2019s about to pop like an overinflated balloon. Like me, she\u2019s been waiting quietly for him to say it as she couldn\u2019t. Wouldn\u2019t dare.\n\nAs women, we continue to protect men\u2019s masculinity and entitlement by giving them this responsibility, says Wasserman. It places an unnecessary and unhealthy responsibility on men to take the lead.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018I\u2019ve been celibate for 3 years, here are 5 things I\u2019ve learnt about love, sex and intimacy so far\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we perpetuate the idea that masculinity makes them stronger to bare rejection.\u201d She adds that because so many men aren\u2019t as in touch with their emotions, saying \u201cI love you\u201d is not even a big deal for them.\n\nLearnt behaviour has led us to this place. But maybe it is time to unlearn and rethink our approach to love? We\u2019ve done it with marriage, relationships and every other traditional structure in our world, why not the \u201cI love you\u201d?\n\n\u201cFor some people, expressing the words \u2018I love you\u2019 is less important than showing it. Words of affirmation is one way to \u2018express love\u2019. Buying gifts, spending quality time together, physical touch and/or acts of service are other ways of communicating and showing that you care,\u201d says dating and life coach, Shelley Lewin.\n\nREAD MORE: 'I\u2019m dating the funniest, most loving guy but he is broke' \u2013 this woman wonders if she should choose financial stability or love\n\nMy ex\u2019s love language was \u2018giving\u2019. Practical things I needed in my life like an electric toothbrush, a new knife and fixing things around my flat. He gave love.\n\nLewin says, however, you must be honest with yourself in a relationship. If hearing the words is important, it might be worthwhile to have a conversation to explore how your partners feels about expressing words of love and affection. Until you make it clear to them that you prefer for them to be expressive, don\u2019t assume there is anything wrong.\n\nShe does add, however, that if they say it too soon - that is when you do not feel comfortable to receive it, when it feels invasive, pressured and demanding a reciprocal response - then it is a red flag: it may well be the beginning of a controlling partner.\n\nDoes hearing a premature \"I love you\" send you packing, or are you often the party who waits with batted breath to hear the magic phrase?
