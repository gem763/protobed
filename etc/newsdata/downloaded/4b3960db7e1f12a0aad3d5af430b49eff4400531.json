According to multiple reports, nothing was off-limits when it came to lambasting Baldwin, including his notoriously hot temper with the paparazzi, his wife who is 26 years his junior, his past substance abuse and his often off-color brand of fatherhood.\n\nALEC BALDWIN HATED PLAYING TRUMP ON SNL, SAYS HE HOPED 'A METEOR HITS THIS BUILDING AND KILLS ME\n\nAccording to Variety, De Niro was a pretty common target for jokes throughout the evening as well, with Roast Master Sean Hayes jabbing him for some of his more screwball roles in recent years.\n\n\u201cIs this the same Robert De Niro that did \u2018Little Fockers\u2019 and \u2018Dirty Grandpa\u2019?\u201d asked Hayes. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for someone to make you an offer you can refuse. Alec Baldwin needs anger management like Robert De Niro needs better management.\u201d\n\nWhen it was the 76-year-old\u2019s turn at the microphone, he acknowledged how odd it was that he was there at all. He also took a moment to reference his and Baldwin\u2019s respective roles on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d this past season.\n\n\u201cAlec, it\u2019s been a privilege playing Robert Mueller to your Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are an arrogant a--hole and tonight, we\u2019ve all gotten to say that. I just wish Mueller had roasted Trump as frankly and ferociously as we roasted you.\u201d\n\nA big surprise of the evening came when Baldwin\u2019s daughter, 23-year-old model Ireland, took the stage to take some playful jabs at her dad\u2019s past fatherhood mishaps. Baldwin famously called Ireland a \u201crude, thoughtless little pig\u201d in a leaked voicemail in 2007.\n\nAlthough he previously admitted that the voicemail hurt his relationship with Ireland, the duo seemed all-smiles at the event Saturday where she not only targeted her dad but praised her mom, Kim Basinger.\n\nALEC BALDWIN REVEALS HE AND WIFE, HILARIA, WILL \u2018HAVE A FIFTH\u2019 BABY TOGETHER\n\n\"After years of giving verbal abuse, it\u2019s finally time you receive some,\" Ireland quipped (via Variety).\n\n\"It hasn\u2019t been easy being the daughter of an iconic movie star, but I\u2019m not here to talk about my mother,\u201d she joked. \u201cOr her Oscar. Or her continued respect in this industry.\u201d\n\nShe continued by referencing her dad\u2019s role in \u201cMission Impossible\u201d saying: \u201c\u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 is what I call getting my dad to apologize.\u201d\n\nAccording to People, this isn\u2019t the first time that Ireland has touched on her rocky relationship with her father at a roast. In 2017 she addressed the voicemail debacle directly at Spike TV\u2019s \u201cOne Night Only\u201d series.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to roast this big old ham I call my father. Speaking of pigs. Some of you may remember me as that thoughtless little pig you read about,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cThat was a decade ago, and my dad and I are in a much better place now. He would never say something like that. Because I\u2019m 6\u20192\u201d and I would kick his a--.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe roast Saturday, which airs on Sept. 15, enlisted the help of several celebrity roasters, including Ken Jeong, Chris Redd, Jeff Ross, Blake Griffin, Nikki Glaser, Caitlyn Jenner, Adam Carolla and Caroline Rhea.", "description": "Alec Baldwin found himself in the hot seat Saturday night during the taping of his Comedy Central Roast where he took hits from actor Robert De Niro, his daughter Ireland and many more.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AlexIrelandBaldwin1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
