Nevertheless, the sheer enormity of this parade has generated both admiration and scorn.\n\nThe Ministry of National Defence has reported that 15,000 military personnel will be taking part, including 59 different elements of the military, while 580 pieces of military equipment will roll through the streets and 160 aircraft will fly overhead.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping will review troops along Chang'an Avenue - Beijing's major thoroughfare - and afterwards a number of foot, armour and aircraft formations will pass through or over Tiananmen Square.\n\nFor the first time, a contingent from China's 8,000-strong UN peacekeeping standby force will participate.\n\nWhat equipment are we going to see?\n\nThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) is clearly excited about showcasing sophisticated new weapons platforms, all of which it says are already in active service.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The last major parade in 2015 saw dramatic flyovers from military aircraft\n\nPLA propagandists have placed particular emphasis on new missile, stealth and unmanned vehicle capabilities. Among the machinery we're expecting too see on show are:\n\nThe latest road-mobile DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile, which Chinese analysts say is able to target any part of the globe, will be unveiled. It is said to carry a warhead payload of 10 multiple, independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRV). A MIRV warhead can be guided towards a specific target, so one could potentially hit 10 different targets over a wide area.\n\nAnother ballistic missile system, the DF-17, said to be able to carry a hypersonic glide vehicle akin to Russia's Avangard system. Such vehicles are able to manoeuvre evasively at incredibly high speeds in order to evade missile defence systems.\n\nMore new missile systems including anti-ship, anti-aircraft and cruise missiles, as well as a new long-range multiple rocket launcher.\n\nTwo unmanned aircraft, one a supersonic surveillance and targeting drone called the DR-8 and the other a stealthy batwing-shaped drone dubbed Sharp Sword, designed to be launched from aircraft carriers.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption J-20 stealth fighters will swoop through the skies over Tiananmen\n\nY-20 transport aircraft, J-20 stealth fighters and early warning and surveillance aircraft.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption H6-N strategic bomber\n\nThe latest variant of China's strategic bomber the H6-N - capable of in-flight refuelling and carrying air-launched ballistic missiles.\n\nThe PLA has emphasised that the parade will also demonstrate new levels of innovation from the domestic defence industry, and improved strike capability.\n\nHow much does China spend on its military?\n\nIncreases in China's military spending have been remarkable, and have accelerated since Mr Xi announced major reforms in 2015.\n\nOver the last decade, the defence budget grew by at least 10% every year - it now stands at $168.2bn (\u00a3136.9bn), the second largest in the world.\n\nChina is also by far Asia's biggest defence investor, in 2018 spending $56.1bn in weapons procurement and defence research and development, just over 33% of China's overall defence budget. A recent defence white paper called this \"reasonable and appropriate\" expenditure.\n\nIn tune with its emphasis on defence, China has downplayed such spending increases through comparisons to that of the US, which remains the biggest global defence spender by a considerable order of magnitude - a total of $643.3bn in 2018.\n\nBeijing argues that despite being the world's second largest economy, its defence spending was less than a quarter of that of the US in 2017, and works out at $100 per head of population - just 5% of that of the US.\n\nHow does China think it might need use its military?\n\nChina says it is building a \"strong military\" to match its international standing and narrow the gap with the world's leading militaries.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption China has been emphasising its role as a global peacekeeping force in recent years\n\nA clue as to its motivations comes from that white paper, which at the outset accuses the US of provoking and intensifying competition among major countries, significantly increasing its defence expenditure, pushing for additional capacity in nuclear, outer space, cyber and missile defence, and undermining global strategic stability.\n\nAnd right at the top of a list of security risks and challenges, the document describes the fight against separatists becoming more acute and Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party's stubborn adherence to an independence agenda.\n\nChina considers Taiwan a breakaway province which will one day be brought back under mainland control - by force if necessary. Reunification is a central part of President Xi's goal of \"national rejuvenation\", also a key theme in the parade.\n\nWith Taiwan's presidential elections only three months away, the prevalence of ballistic missile systems and heavy emphasis on stealth and cutting-edge technologies at the parade will be a message of deterrence.\n\nThe parade will seek to demonstrate China's determination to defend its core interests, including its disputed territorial claims in the South China Sea.\n\nImage copyright Getty/DigitalGlobe Image caption China has built of significant military infrastructure on the disputed atolls in the Spratly Islands\n\nFor example, the missile platforms could be used to defend the new naval and air bases built on reclaimed atolls in the Spratly Islands. China, in fact, live-fired anti-ship ballistic missiles into the South China Sea at the end of June.\n\nThese capabilities are believed to be part of China's Anti-Access, Area Denial (A2AD) strategy, to prevent US access to the South China Sea.\n\nIs China's military close to rivalling the US?\n\nOne of the big differences with Tuesday, in contrast to the last big parade in Beijing in 2015, will be an air of celebration.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption China's military has a long way to go before it can reach the military capability of the US\n\nThe V-day parade, marking the 70th anniversary of the victory over Japan in World War Two, was an altogether solemn affair. This parade on the contrary seeks to celebrate China's achievements in terms of defence innovation and indigenous production.\n\nThe key message is that the PLA has truly moved into a new era - Xi Jinping's new era - and that following far-reaching reforms, it is well positioned to advance towards becoming a truly modernised force by 2035 and world-class force by 2049.\n\nHowever, while a lavish military parade may showcase the scale of its investment, it cannot portray the PLA's overall military capability.\n\nChina's need to improve its military salary structuring, integrated joint logistics and training regimes are all part of the mix. In addition, China's ambitious military reform agenda involves a comprehensive and expensive overhaul of command and force structures.\n\nDespite the eye-catching sophistication of the arsenal which will be paraded, the PLA is still many decades away from reaching military capability akin to that of the US.\n\nAlexander Neill is a Shangri-La Dialogue senior fellow for Asia Pacific security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.", "description": "The massive military parade will send a message that China is \"peace-loving\" but ready for anything.", "authors": ["Alex Neill", "International Institute For Strategic Studies"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AFFB/production/_109015054_gettyimages-1170989396.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
