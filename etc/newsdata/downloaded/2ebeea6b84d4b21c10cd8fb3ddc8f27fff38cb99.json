Their numbers were expected to swell though the day.\n\nDemonstrations erupted across the country late on Thursday after the government announced a $0.20 tax on the huge number of calls made on messaging applications.\n\nThey are the largest since a 2015 refuse collection crisis sparked widespread anti-government protests.\n\nThey come at a time of deep divisions within the government over a raft of issues, including not only the economic reform package, but also the allocation of public sector positions and rapprochement with the resurgent Syrian government.\n\nIn central Beirut, rioting continued into the early hours of Friday.\n\nSecurity forces finally dispersed the demonstrators shortly before dawn, firing volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets after they tried to storm government headquarters.\n\nThe clashes wounded at least 23 protesters, according to the Red Cross, and 60 security force personnel, according to police.\n\nNNA said two foreign workers choked to death early Friday after they were trapped in a building set alight by rioters.\n\nOther reports said the two men were Syrian.\n\nGrowth in Lebanon has plummeted in the face of repeated political deadlock in recent years, compounded by the impact of eight years of war in neighbouring Syria.\n\n\u201cMost high-frequency indicators point towards a continuation of weak growth in 2019,\u201d the International Monetary Fund said Thursday.\n\nLebanon\u2019s public debt stands at around $86 billion \u2014 more than 150 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 according to the finance ministry.\n\nEighty percent of that figure is owed to Lebanon\u2019s central bank and local banks.\n\nLast month, banks and money exchange houses rationed dollar sales, sparking fears of a devaluation of the Lebanese pound.", "description": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013 Hundreds of protesters blocked major highways in Lebanon Friday, after thousands angry at proposed tax increases thronged the streets", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/c731ef_lebanese-demonstrators-angered-by-an-austerity-budget-government-passed-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
