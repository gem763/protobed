Those days are long behind them. The end of the road may have been reached in Tokyo, succumbing to a physically superior, Terminator-like South African side, but there\u2019s no going back to a life of \u2018upsets\u2019 and \u2018surprises\u2019. The bar has been raised. Expectations adjusted. The Japanese have pulled up a seat at the top table, elbows out, and whether or not the waiters approve, they\u2019ve tucked straight into the mains.\n\nAnd what a sight to see. The Rugby World Cup needed this. The sport, in fact, needed this. For too long, rugby has been the preserve of that elite minority who have dominated the landscape, setting the agenda both on and off the pitch. But in Japan we have an unknown entity, bristling with promise and potential \u2013 a stark reminder that you don\u2019t always need to follow the crowd in getting to where you want to be.\n\nBecause that\u2019s been one of the absorbing delights of this Japanese rugby team. They\u2019ve completely torn up the script of how the sport should be played. It\u2019s been bombastic in approach and utterly unpredictable at times, with all caution thrown to the wind by Jamie Joseph and his men.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It may have part of a wider game plan to unsettle the Springboks \u2013 \u201cWe planned to create unstructured situations and there were spaces [to exploit] so we managed that,\u201d Tamura said afterwards \u2013 but you feel that only the Japanese would have the audacity, the temerity to adopt such thrilling, heart-in-mouth tactics.\n\nIt\u2019s been the same story throughout the tournament: from the hot-potato offloading that left Scotland\u2019s backline in tatters, shredded beyond repair, to the electrifying surges in pace of Kenki Fukuoka and Matsushima that have terrorised defence after defence. It\u2019s been breathless, a riot of energy and speed and heroism and conviction. And until they were met by a sky-high wall of Springboks that ultimately refused to give an inch, it felt like there\u2019d be no end to this dizzying run.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Admittedly, the Japanese aren\u2019t quite there yet. They\u2019re the new kids on the block. The interlopers. Your mate\u2019s mate, the one you\u2019ve still not made your mind up on yet. Because while the side has seemingly cut itself free from the mediocrities of the past \u2013 see: 2011, New Zealand 83-7 Japan \u2013 this is just the beginning. If Japan are planning on sticking around, they\u2019ve got to earn the right.\n\nAs that\u2019s what separates the game\u2019s elite from the rest. Consistency. The ability to produce performance after performance when it matters most. The ability to hold your own among the big boys. We can\u2019t deny what Japan have achieved on home soil, but the next step is making sure such feats are recreated in the years to come.\n\nStill, progress has been made. And that\u2019s not to be sniffed at, especially when the inequalities in the game are so wide and the opportunities so few. Just look at their record. Four years ago, Japan had fallen agonisingly short of a quarter-final berth. In New Zealand prior to that, they finished bottom of Pool A without a win and four points behind behind Canada. Eight years may be a long time, but there\u2019s no denying the upward trajectory \u2013 and if they can continue along that path, then who knows what the future holds.\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be easy, though. In many ways, this is the end of an era for the current side. For key players such as Michael Leitch (31), Shota Horie (33), Luke Thompson (38), Ryohei Yamanaka (31) and Yu Tamura (30), this World Cup could well be their last, depriving Japan of a central core that has been crucial to fostering team spirit and togetherness.\n\nWith the Sunwolves, where many of Japan\u2019s stars ply their trade, also set to drop out of Super Rugby as of 2020, the worry is that crucial exposure to and experience among the game\u2019s best talents will be lost. Although proposals have been made by the Japanese Rugby Football Union (JRFU) to establish a new professional league within the country, there\u2019s nothing yet set in stone. If nothing comes of it, the nation\u2019s representatives may well find themselves struggling to develop and push on ahead of France 2023.\n\nMore than anything else, Japan will be desperate to keep hold of Joseph \u2013 a man who has no doubt caught the attention of the likes of New Zealand, Ireland and Australia, all three of whom will be on the hunt for a new head coach once the tournament comes to a close. Joseph has built firmly upon Eddie Jones\u2019 foundations, moulding and sculpting this current crop of players into a force to be reckoned with. \u201cThe reason that this team has changed is because of Jamie Joseph, in how he led us and how he taught us rugby,\u201d said Leitch at this World Cup. If the JRFU is serious about building for the future, Joseph needs to be on the scene.\n\nBut regardless of what comes, Japan can still look back over the past five weeks and know it\u2019s carved out something special on these shores, something that won\u2019t fade from memory. It\u2019s hard to truly quantify the way in which the Japanese people have embraced rugby, a sport that lacks the same status as baseball, sumo or soccer. The numbers certainly give an idea \u2013 60 million tuned in for the win over Scotland, a figure that is expected to be bettered by yesterday\u2019s quarter-final \u2013 but it\u2019s the sights and sounds of those living in the moment, right in the heady, intoxicating thick of it, which point to the wave of enthusiasm that has rolled across the nation.\n\nIt\u2019s the old men on the metro pouring over their broadsheets \u2013 yes, they\u2019ve still got them here \u2013 glued to the sports pages, desperate to hover up every last word on the Brave Blossoms. It\u2019s the father and his seven-year-old daughter, bright-eyed beneath her Kabuki face paint, dressed in a cool-blue kimono, a pair of sandal-styled geta to boot, heading to her first rugby match. It\u2019s the Japanese mascot, singing her heart out for the hosts before switching to the Springboks\u2019 national anthem, which, for the record, features five of the country\u2019s 11 official languages. Or it\u2019s the thousands of fans reduced to tears by defeat and the deflating realisation that, for now, the journey has reached its end.\n\nAcross all walks of Japanese life, it seems the national side have caught the gaze of those curious onlookers eager to get swept along in the rush and thrill. \u201cI have 70-year old-women who are watching all the games,\u201d says Shotaro Honda Moore, a long-time rugby fan and English teacher in Tokyo. \u201cNow I don\u2019t want to stereotype and say 70-year-old women don\u2019t like sport, but she\u2019ll say \u2018I\u2019ve never seen rugby before.\u2019 But because the event is so massive and everyone is so into it, it sucks people in.\u201d\n\nWhether this widespread enthusiasm stands firm and can draw in both the crowds and participants needed to grow the Japanese game, only time will tell. But on and off the pitch, Japan has left its mark. The nation has blazed a trail, established itself as a shining example to those smaller sides and unions who, for decades now, have been chasing the coat tails of the sport\u2019s heavyweights. Whatever is to come in the years ahead, maybe that can be Japan\u2019s legacy: the ability to turn miracles into the mundane and show that anything is possible when you put your mind to it.", "description": "Japan\u00a0don\u2019t deal in miracles anymore.
