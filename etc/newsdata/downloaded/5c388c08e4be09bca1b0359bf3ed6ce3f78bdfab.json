On their wedding day, they joined the picket line.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nAuto workers LaCrystal Robertson and Steven Ferguson met at a General Motors plant in Tennessee. The couple joined the picket line after their recent wedding.\n\nAfter her Sept. 21 wedding to a fellow autoworker, the new bride put down her bouquet and picked up a picket sign.\n\nLaCrystal Robertson, 27, and Steve Ferguson, 37, were still in their formal wedding wear when they joined their fellow employees outside the north gate of the General Motors plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., for what was then the sixth day of the United Auto Workers\u2019 nationwide strike.\n\nAfter 49,000 UAW members around the country walked off the job on Sept. 16, calling for better wages, health care and other benefits, there was never a question of the couple sitting out, even for their wedding day.\n\n\u201cWe both looked at each other and said, \u2018If we\u2019re still on strike, after all is said and done, we\u2019re gonna go up to the picket line and stand there in our wedding attire,\u2019\u201d Ferguson told The Washington Post on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ll show them just because it\u2019s our special day, we\u2019re not forgetting about what we\u2019re fighting for.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s post-wedding protest was first reported by Nashville\u2019s News Channel 5.\n\n[GM strike enters 2nd week with no clear end in sight]\n\nWhen the couple reached the picket line around midnight, their colleagues greeted them with applause. For Ferguson, it was his second visit of the day.\n\n\u201cI did my four-hour strike duty from 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. that day,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nGM autoworker LaCrystal Robertson with several of her GM colleagues on her wedding day.\n\nIt was a fitting end to the wedding day of a couple whose love story began on the manufacturing floor three years ago.\n\n\u201cI come from a long line of GM family,\" Ferguson said. \u201cBoth my grandfathers and my father worked for GM. Aunts and uncles worked for GM.\u201d\n\nRobertson worked in general assembly, where freshly painted Acadias and Cadillacs rolled down the line. Ferguson, a team leader who was free to roam around the floor, took notice of her.\n\n\u201cTotally workplace romance, total luck of the draw on my part,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\nHe would try to spark conversations with his now-wife when the two were on break. Throughout the months, he noticed her penchant for dressing up for the holidays and finally asked her on a date two days before Christmas in 2016. She was dressed like an elf. Ferguson grabbed a Santa mask from a co-worker and, outside of work, asked for a kiss.\n\n\u201cThe rest is history,\u201d Robertson said.\n\n[Perspective: What\u2019s really at stake in the GM strike? The future of cars.]\n\nFerguson proposed last Christmas, almost two years to the day from their first date, and preparations for their no-frills, rustic affair were in the works ever since.\n\nRobertson donned a white silk gown she proudly nabbed for $30; her mother, a local restaurant owner, made the food; colleagues from UAW Local 1853 in attendance looked on as the couple shared a first dance to a country ballad.\n\nWhen the strike was called a week before her wedding, Robertson told colleagues she\u2019d be out on strike, even in her gown.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019ll be up here in my dress.\u2019 The more I said it, the more I want to do it,\u201d Robertson said.\n\n\n\nFerguson and Robertson on their wedding day.\n\nThe wedding served as a reminder of what\u2019s at stake for their family in the strike.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a big, extravagant life but we were provided a very good life. That\u2019s what I want for all four of my children,\u201d Ferguson said. He wants his children to have the same benefits he has now, should any of them become the fourth generation of autoworkers in the family.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them to \u2026 have to worry about getting hired as a temp, worrying about their health care or not being paid a fair wage.\u201d\n\n[GM reverses course, says strikers will keep health coverage Add to list]\n\nStriking workers are calling for better wages, health care, job security and a process to make temporary workers permanent hires \u2014 the latter of which has been a particular sticking point of the strike. According to the Detroit Free-Press, GM\u2019s use of temporary workers was a concession the union made to help the automaker get through the lean years surrounding the 2008 recession.\n\nGM, which brought in a profit of $8.1 billion after taxes last year, wanted workers to pay a greater share of their health care and wanted continued flexibility to use temp workers but also offered to invest more than $7 billion in new U.S. plants, add jobs and increase pay.\n\nDespite the couple\u2019s whirlwind day, which ended well after midnight by the time they finally left the picket line, Robertson had a clear memory of what was a particular highlight for her: Whipping her hair around as she and her children danced to Twisted Sister\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019re Not Gonna Take It\u201d \u2014 a pointed message to GM executives, she confirmed.\n\nRead more:\n\nAn airman was picking up an award for heroism.
