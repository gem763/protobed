They vowed not to return to work until the union leader was found.\n\nShortly before he disappeared, Dr Magombeyi told AFP news agency he had received threatening calls and messages on his phone.\n\nA government spokesman said the authorities had \"no reason\" to abduct Zimbabweans.\n\nA fellow doctor has now said that Dr Magombeyi was left in a bush just outside the capital. It is not clear what happened to him.\n\nThe authorities have suggested the abduction was staged.\n\nThe economic crisis in Zimbabwe has meant doctors' salaries have shrunk to just $100 (\u00a380) a month.
