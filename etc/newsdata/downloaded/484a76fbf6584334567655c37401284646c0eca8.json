Bush.\n\n\u201cRest in peace, irony,\u201d joked MSNBC host Joy Reid Saturday on \u201cAM Joy\u201d after playing clips of the Trump brothers angrily ripping Hunter Biden.\n\nReid\u2019s guest David Frum quipped: \u201dWhen you see poor Eric and poor Don Jr., you realize there are bivalves with more self-awareness than the Trump children.\u201d\n\nThey argue \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that Joe Biden worked to block a corruption probe into an energy company whose board of directors included his son. Meanwhile, they profit from international operations stretching to as many as 30 nations still owned by their dad, the president.\n\n\u201cPresidential families should behave themselves in more circumspect ways,\u201d said Frum, who is also an author and writer for The Atlantic. \u201cThe Trump family is so far and away the most corrupt in American presidential history that you really can\u2019t think of who\u2019s in second place.\u201d\n\nEric Trump last month slammed Hunter Biden\u2019s role in an international company. A day later he hailed a brand new housing complex development in Scotland for the Trump Organization, which is still owned by his dad.\n\nJust weeks earlier the Air Force launched an investigation into personnel spending tens of thousands of dollars at Trump Organization\u2019s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland during refueling layovers at newly favored nearby Prestwick airport.\n\nCongratulations to our extraordinary @TrumpScotland team! Minutes ago, we received full & total approval for a new phase of development to include 500 homes, 50 cottages, sports center, retail & more. We also received approval to build a 2nd golf course! Very proud of them! pic.twitter.com/odVxomGdmf \u2014 Eric Trump (@EricTrump) September 26, 2019\n\nBoth Reid and Frum referred to Ivanka Trump obtaining several Chinese trademarks for her private company \u2014 including for voting machines \u2014 last year even as she was dealing with Chinese officials in her role as a senior White House adviser. The First Daughter won three trademarks in 2017 on the same day she dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago. She was granted five trademarks early this year ahead of trade talks with the Chinese.\n\n\u201cYou have Ivanka Trump getting Chinese trademarks for voting machines,\u201d noted Reid. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Donald Trump Jr. in Indonesia kicking off the sale of luxury condos\u201d \u2014 developed with a $500 million cash infusion from a China-owned construction business. \u201cWhat is happening here?\u201d\n\nJared Kushner, meanwhile, met with senior officers of the Anbang investment operation in China \u201cwith a view to get hundreds of millions of dollars to rescue his desperately failing project on Fifth Avenue,\u201d noted Frum.\n\nThe president complaining about corruption in government is like \u201chearing Al Capone complain about mob activity in Chicago,\u201d quipped Reid\u2019s other guest, Elizabeth Spiers, former editor of the New York Observer, which Kushner once owned.\n\nCheck out the discussion in the video above.", "description": "Eric and Donald Trump Jr. seem to be lobbing at Hunter Biden from a glass house, and don't even know it.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9957a7200000f2004d7f31.jpeg?cache=9fmvbjx48g&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
