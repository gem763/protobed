The rapper even changed her name on Twitter to Mrs. Petty earlier this month.\n\nOn her Queen Radio show in June, Minaj revealed that she and Petty had acquired a marriage license and intended to wed within \u201cabout 80 days.\u201d\n\nBut she\u2019s also been teasing that a follow-up to her fourth studio album \u201cQueen\u201d was in the works, explaining that she was putting the music before wedding planning.\n\n\u201cI have to work on my album and I have a lot to focus on that I don\u2019t want to do the big wedding now.
