REUTERS/Chris Wattie\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals are set to form a minority government after a tight election on Monday, with the latest tally from Elections Canada showing Liberals had won or were leading in 155 out of 338 seats.\n\nA minority government leaves Trudeau in a weakened position and needing the support of a party such as the New Democrats (NDP) to push through key pieces of legislation.\n\n\u201cThis is likely to exert drag on a Canadian dollar that might otherwise ride solid economic data, favorable interest rate differentials, and improving risk appetite higher,\u201d said Karl Schamotta, director global markets strategy at Cambridge Global Payments.\n\nThe Canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged at 1.3082 to the U.S. dollar. The currency, which was boosted on Monday by signs of progress toward a resolution of the trade dispute between the United States and China, notched its strongest intraday level since July 22 at 1.3071.\n\nThe loonie has been the top-performing G10 currency this year, up more than 4% against the greenback.\n\nThe NDP has said it would increase corporate income tax rates and implement a wealth tax. It has also indicated its opposition to the expansion of a flagship oil pipeline, Trans Mountain.\n\n\u201cI expect limited stock market reaction on this outcome, energy stocks won\u2019t get any relief bounce on this news and should see a further deterioration in sentiment towards the space,\u201d Mike Archibald, associate portfolio manager at AGF Investments Inc.\n\nThe energy sector has the second largest weighting on Toronto\u2019s benchmark stock index .GSPTSE at about 16%.\n\n\u201cIn this scenario, pipeline approval would likely have a tough time passing, putting further pressure on Canadian energy stocks,\u201d Archibald added.\n\nCanada is the world\u2019s fourth-biggest producer of crude and the energy industry accounts for about 11% of annual nominal gross domestic product.\n\nStill, the economy could get a boost from additional fiscal spending. Trudeau has said he would nearly double the deficit from C$14 billion ($10.7 billion) in the fiscal year that ended in March.\n\n\u201cThis likely suggests no major changes in the economic outlook, although the minority government will impel them (the Liberals) to agree to some of the policy priorities of the NDP \u2014 pointing to somewhat looser fiscal policy,\u201d said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.\n\n\u201cWe were likely headed in that direction in any event, based on the campaign pledges, but the minority situation will accentuate that trend.\u201d", "description": "The Canadian dollar held near a three-month high on Tuesday as the market took in stride the prospect of a re-elected Liberal government, although some investors worried about the Liberals' need to rely on a left-leaning opposition party for support.", "authors": ["Fergal Smith", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443616809&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0G4-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
