At home, the towering center is even larger as head of the Chinese Basketball Association and one of the most recognizable figures in the country.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver wants to talk to him - soon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping together that Yao Ming and I can find accommodation,\u201d Silver said Tuesday. \u201cBut he is extremely hot at the moment, and I understand it.\u201d\n\nSilver spoke at a new conference in Tokyo before an exhibition game between the Rockets and the NBA champion Toronto Raptors. He defended the right of Rockets general manager Daryl Morey to tweet last week in support of anti-government protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThe tweet has since been deleted. But Silver made it clear what the NBA stands for.\n\n\u201cI understand there are consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression. I regret that so many people (in China) are upset, including millions and millions of our fans.\u201d\n\nSilver said his office had talked with Yao and suggested the two might meet when he travels on Wednesday to Shanghai. The Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets play exhibitions on Thursday in Shanghai and on Saturday in the southern city of Shenzhen, which neighbors Hong Kong.\n\nChina state broadcaster CCTV has said it will not air the two exhibition games.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that Daryl\u2019s tweet has hit what I would describe as a third-rail issue in China,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI think Yao is extremely unsettled. I\u2019m not quite sure he accepts how we are operating our business right now.\u201d\n\nSilver said he and Yao \u201chave been close friends since the joined the league.\u201d He talked of finding \u201cmutual respect for each other\u2019s political systems and beliefs.\u201d\n\nPlayers and coaches were asked about the rift after the Raptors beat the Rockets 134-129.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a distraction,\u201d Rockets guard Russell Westbrook. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on our team and getting better.\u201d\n\nBasketball is very popular in China, driven by roots put down there for three decades by the NBA, and by Yao\u2019s popular career as the first and only Chinese superstar in the league.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m a realist as well and I recognize that this issue may not die down so quickly,\u201d Silver said.\n\nThe CBA, a government-directed body headed by Yao, has suspended its relationship with the Rockets as a response to Morey\u2019s tweet, which read \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nSilver said the disputed tweet may have inadvertently raised the issues surrounding Hong Kong to a wide audience, perhaps to some sports fans \u201cwho might not otherwise pay attention. Sports shines a light on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, I don\u2019t come here as the commissioner of the NBA and an American to tell others how to run their governments,\u201d Silver added. \u201cAt the end of the day, though, I am an American and there are some values that are deeply rooted in the DNA of the NBA. That includes freedom of expression for our employees.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Yao Ming could be the man in the middle if the NBA and China are going to mend fences.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Wade"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/japan_rockets_raptors_basketball_67554_c0-190-4543-2838_s1770x1032.jpg?ae124dd1034736056be66f4e8c572812c713a40e", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
