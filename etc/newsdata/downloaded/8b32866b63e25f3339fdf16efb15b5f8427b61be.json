Now, it seems, the streaming service wants to influence teens on the topic of abortion as well.\n\nThe second episode, \u201cIf You\u2019re Breathing, You\u2019re a Liar,\u201d follows one of the main characters, Chloe, as she seeks out an abortion. The plot decision was met with applause by many in the media. Bustle praised the show for a \u201crealistic look at a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d Refinery29 called the scene \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d while Seventeen deemed it \u201cintense.\u201d\n\nThey had a hunch it was in the works. Last year, the actress who plays Chloe, Anne Winters, and the actor who plays her boyfriend, Justin Prentice, predicted an abortion in the new season. And Netflix, which has worked with groups like Planned Parenthood, isn\u2019t new to producing abortion scenes.\n\nOnce the popular cheerleader, Chloe reveals to some of her classmates that she\u2019s pregnant. The father of her baby is Bryce (Justin Prentice), a jock and a rapist who has sexually assaulted both her and other young women.\n\nChloe reasons at one point, \u201cI really felt like I loved him.\u201d But instead of telling Bryce that she\u2019s pregnant, she confides in her friend Zach (Ross Butler).\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she tells him. Still, in the very next scene, Chloe finds herself at an abortion clinic \u2013 or what she thinks is an abortion clinic.\n\nShe soon realizes that she is actually at a pregnancy center posing as an abortion clinic, after a \u201ccounselor\u201d uses words like \u201cmother\u201d and \u201cbaby.\u201d The show frames the woman as manipulative while she tells Chloe that the \u201cultrasound looks good\u201d and makes a point of showing the sonogram.\n\nBut that\u2019s only the beginning of the episode\u2019s attempt to paint the pro-life movement as deceptive.\n\nWhen Chloe brings Zach with her to an actual abortion clinic, they encounter a sidewalk counselor posing as an abortion-clinic escort. As Chloe begins to walk from the car to the clinic, other sidewalk counselors start shouting at her while the \u201cescort\u201d takes Chloe by the arm to \u201cwalk [her] past the crazies.\u201d\n\nBut as they near the door, the \u201cescort\u201d reveals she\u2019s one of the \u201ccrazies.\u201d\n\n\u201cKilling is a sin,\u201d she pressures Chloe. \u201cBut it\u2019s not too late. This is the moment where you decide the fate of two souls. Choose wisely, or you\u2019ll regret this day until you die.\u201d\n\nBefore she departs, she shocks Chloe by handing her a model of a fetus with red blood drawn on it.\n\nIn response to the scenes, Sidewalk Advocates for Life, which trains thousands of volunteers to offer women alternatives to abortion at clinics, criticized the episode as \u201cabortion propaganda.\u201d It condemned the \u201ccounselor\u201d who \u201cuses not-so-subtle psychological tactics to foment anxiety\u201d and the activist employing a \u201cdeceitful, last-ditch effort to intimidate women using guilt and gore.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese situations and characters are propagandistic caricatures that in no way represent what takes place on the sidewalk as American women in need of support meet Sidewalk Advocates and prayer volunteers before they make a final decision \u2013 or inside the many pregnancy resource centers we are proud to refer to,\u201d its August 28 press release read.\n\nThis isn\u2019t new: many in the media regularly attempt to demonize pregnancy centers, which provide pregnant women and new moms with free housing, medical supplies, clothing, and educational classes, among other support.\n\nNetflix later showed Chloe having her abortion while eight weeks pregnant. Before she goes through with it, the clinician describes how a \u201csuction device will dislodge and remove the uterine content.\u201d\n\nDuring the abortion scene itself, the camera focuses on Chloe, as she bites her lip, breathes heavily, and grasps her hands. The clinicians encourage her before the abortionist turns on the \u201cuterine content\u201d vacuum.\n\nThe viewers don\u2019t see what the abortionist sees as she performs the abortion. They don\u2019t catch a glimpse of the \u201ccontent\u201d sucked out.\n\nScenes like this aren\u2019t surprising coming from Netflix. Not only did it recently promise to \u201crethink\u201d its investment in Georgia after the state passed new abortion restrictions, but Netflix has also worked with Planned Parenthood to create abortion scenes, such as in \"Big Mouth.\"\n\nAdditionally, Planned Parenthood has served as an advisor to Netflix show creators for abortion scenes, like the one in \"GLOW\" in 2017. Other Netflix shows have addressed abortion, too, from \"Sex Education\" in 2019 to \"BoJack Horseman\" in 2016.\n\nSome Netflix productions have claimed to be neutral on abortion, while proving otherwise. Last September, the streaming platform released \"Reversing Roe,\" a documentary about Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that legalized abortion nationwide. While Netflix praised the film for \u201cinterviews with key figures from both sides,\u201d only one pro-life woman made an appearance \u2013 alongside 13 women who supported abortion. Several pro-life women later confirmed they had been interviewed for the project, but didn\u2019t make the cut.\n\nNetflix also boasts a financial relationship with Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider. Outside spending data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics ranks Netflix, Inc. as 34th in top donors to Planned Parenthood in 2018. Individuals affiliated with Netflix gave $19,500 that year, and the organization itself gave $10,000.\n\nNetflix and the media should show abortion for what it is. But too often instead, they\u2019re showing abortion for what they think it is \u2013 or for what they want it to be.", "description": "The media are praising the new abortion plot in \"13 .09/02/2019 3:23:10AM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Yoder", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/212/520e3b38-79ce-4d4f-a751-d87365394888.jpg"}
