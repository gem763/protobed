It calls for formulating a uniform standard of conduct that is no less stringent than the fiduciary duty that currently applies to registered advisors.\n\nThe attorneys general say Reg BI won\u2019t adequately protect investors from conflicted advice. They also assert that states will lose tax revenue as a result of the lower value of retirement distributions and will have to take on the costs of caring for retirees who don\u2019t have enough savings.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about the Administrative Procedure Act; it\u2019s also about federalism,\u201d said Marlon Paz, a partner at Mayer Brown, told InvestmentNews. \u201cIt\u2019s about the states\u2019 ability to protect their citizens and the federal government\u2019s ability to dictate a national [advice] standard. There\u2019s a long road ahead.\u201d\n\nA separate suit filed by XY Planning Network also argues that the SEC sidestepped Dodd-Frank. In addition, it claims Reg BI puts investment advisOrs at a competitive disadvantage because \u201cit makes it more difficult to differentiate their fiduciary standard of conduct from the lower standard of conduct now applicable to broker-dealers.\u201d\n\n-- John Kimelman", "description": "Courts will decide whether the SEC ignored a Congressional mandate to create uniform rules for brokers and advisors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-108688/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
