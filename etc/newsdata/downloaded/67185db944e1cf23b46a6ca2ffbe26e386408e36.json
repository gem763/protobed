The administration said the changes represent the most significant expansion of counterterrorism powers since they were originally ordered by then-President George W. Bush in the days after the World Trade Center and Pentagon were struck.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury and State Department blacklisted dozens of people, currency-exchange houses and companies allegedly associated with U.S.-designated terror groups, including Hamas, al Qaeda, Islamic State, Hezbollah and the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nBesides cutting off the targets\u2019 access to the U.S., the sanctions also mean any individual or company doing business with them also risk being cut off from the world\u2019s most powerful economy.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who appeared with Mr. Pompeo at a press briefing, said the modernized counterterrorism executive order helps the administration target the financial networks used by terror groups.\n\n\u201cThese new authorities will allow the U.S. government to starve terrorists of resources they need to attack the United States and our allies, and will hold foreign financial institutions who continue to do business with them accountable,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.\n\nMany of the targets of Tuesday\u2019s sanctions are companies that exchange one currency for another as part of an alleged attempt to hide the intended source and intended terror-financing recipients. Those exchange houses, U.S. officials and terror experts say, are key conduits for financing Hezbollah, Hamas, the IRGC and other groups.\n\nUnder the new powers, any foreign financial institution that is found to have conducted terror-linked transactions risks losing access to the dollar and the world\u2019s most important financial system, a sanction that has often spelled the end of financial institutions.\n\nMany of the targets also have operations in Turkey, highlighting a major concern among U.S. officials that lax financial and corporate oversight by the government in Ankara has allowed terror financing and evasion of sanctions to proliferate in the country. The Turkish Embassy in Washington didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWrite to Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com", "description": "The Treasury and State Department blacklisted dozens of people, currency-exchange houses and companies allegedly associated with U.S.-designated terror groups.", "authors": ["Ian Talley"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105817/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
