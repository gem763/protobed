He gave us no choice. So, it wasn\u2019t any change of mind. I always said we will follow the facts where they take us, and when we see them, we will be ready. And, we are ready.\u201d\n\nDemocrats announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump over a whistleblower's claim he improperly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of an energy company in Ukraine.\n\nPelosi, D-Calif., said Trump told her about the interaction: \u201cHe told me it was perfect, there was nothing in the call. But, I know what was in the call. I mean, it was in the public domain. He didn\u2019t even know that it was wrong.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cIt is wrong for a president to say that he wants you -- another head of state -- to create something negative about his possible political opponent to his own advantage, at the expense of our national security, his oath of office to the Constitution and the integrity of our elections.\u201d\n\nREPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER\u2019S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE\n\nHunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma at the same time as his father was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Kiev. Trump also has claimed that Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to shut down a corruption investigation of Burisma. The former vice president has denied doing anything wrong.\n\nIn the July call, Zelensky appeared to make an effort to stay in Trump\u2019s good graces, telling him at least twice that he was \u201cabsolutely right.\u201d But, after the White House released a rough transcript this week based on officials\u2019 recollections of the call, Zelensky told reporters he didn\u2019t feel pushed, emphasizing that \u201cno one can pressure me.\u201d He also sought to play down the situation involving Biden and his son\u2019s activities in Ukraine, calling it just one of \u201cmany cases that I talk about with leaders of other countries.\u201d\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that House lawmakers have reached an agreement with the whistleblower.\n\nHe said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d expects the whistleblower to testify.\n\n\u201cWe have a pretty good road map -- thanks to the courage of this whistleblower. The complaint sets out any number of witnesses, any number of documents that we need to seek.\u201d\n\nHe added he was shocked by Trump\u2019s alleged audacity. \u201cAfter the last two years that we\u2019ve been through, the president well understood that it was illegal to seek foreign assistance in a campaign. And, immediately after [former Special Counsel Robert] Mueller testified, that is exactly what he was back at doing again.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump, in a string of Sunday night tweets, claimed Schiff committed \u201ctreason\u201d for reading an exaggerated take of the phone call during a hearing last week. Schiff later described it as \u201cat least, part, in parody.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., disagreed with the Democrats\u2019 vision: \u201cWhen I read the transcript, I see two leaders having admiration, not intimidation.\u201d", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0told CBS News\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday that despite her previous hesitation to launch impeachment proceedings against President Trump, Democrats are now ready to impeach the commander-in-chief if necessary.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
