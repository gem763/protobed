I\u2019m using the term dissolve intentionally here. To resolve a conflict is to acknowledge that it exists and to talk through the claims of each side and come to some sort of agreement enough people view as legitimate that everyone can mostly move on. But at the moment it is pretty much verboten within progressivism to acknowledge that any trans rights claims could cause rights conflicts. A great example of this came when the Guardian ran a pretty down-the-middle editorial about the these controversies in the U.K. in October that acknowledged instances in which trans women\u2019s rights claims might conflict with cisgender women\u2019s. In response, a group of journalists from the publication\u2019s American offices wrote that they were dismayed that their colleagues across the pond had presented things in this way, but without really addressing the arguments themselves. \u2026 The strategy so many activists and journalists are taking, either assuming anyone with any questions about this is a bigot or, as this post shows, pretending biological sex isn\u2019t a thing or is too complicated to be useful, is, again, a dead end. It\u2019s science denialism geared at attacking a claim \u2014 \u201cThere may be some settings where biological sex should be seen as mattering more than gender identity\u201d \u2014 that many progressives view as deeply threatening to their view that trans people should not only be treated as members of their sex and gender, but are them in some essential way that brooks no exceptions. So they\u2019re fighting back against this belief with science denialism. That\u2019s what this is.\n\nSingal is a progressive who has had to fend off extreme criticism from a battery of transgender writers and activists for trying to cover the issue fairly. For example, in a famous article in the Atlantic, he wrote about people on all sides of the issue:\n\nCari Stella is the author of a blog called Guide on Raging Stars. Stella, now 24, socially transitioned at 15, started hormones at 17, got a double mastectomy at 20, and detransitioned at 22. \u201cI\u2019m a real-live 22-year-old woman with a scarred chest and a broken voice and a 5 o\u2019clock shadow because I couldn\u2019t face the idea of growing up to be a woman,\u201d she said in a video posted in August 2016. \u201cI was not a very emotionally stable teenager,\u201d she told me when we spoke. Transitioning offered a \u201clevel of control over how I was being perceived.\u201d \u2026 But progressive-minded parents can sometimes be a problem for their kids as well. Several of the clinicians I spoke with, including Nate Sharon, Laura Edwards-Leeper, and Scott Leibowitz, recounted new patients\u2019 arriving at their clinics, their parents having already developed detailed plans for them to transition. \u201cI\u2019ve actually had patients with parents pressuring me to recommend their kids start hormones,\u201d Sharon said. \u2026 \u201cAt the time I was not happy that she told me that I should go and deal with mental stuff first,\u201d Delta said, \u201cbut I\u2019m glad that she said that, because too many people are so gung ho and just like, \u2018You\u2019re trans, just go ahead,\u2019 even if they aren\u2019t\u2014and then they end up making mistakes that they can\u2019t redo.\u201d Delta\u2019s gender dysphoria subsequently dissipated, though it\u2019s unclear why.", "description": "Progressives who insist that men can somehow transform themselves into \"transgender\" women are engaging in \"science denialism,\" says writer.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/lgbti-pride-march-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
