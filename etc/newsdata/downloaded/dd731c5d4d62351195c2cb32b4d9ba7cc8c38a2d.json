Let Taika Waititi explain. (Image: Nickelodeon/Fox Searchlight)\n\nOn a long, long, long list of films or TV shows that writer-director Taika Waititi could have listed as influences on his new film, Jojo Rabbit, one you never, ever would have thought of is Rugrats. Yes, the Nickelodeon show Rugrats. And yet, that\u2019s exactly what he said in a recent interview about the film.\n\nJojo Rabbit, which opens in December in Australia, is about a young boy named Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) growing up in Nazi Germany. Jojo loves the Nazis, even though he doesn\u2019t quite grasp their true ideals, and he\u2019s forced to deal with that when he discovers his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) has hidden a young Jewish girl named Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in Jojo\u2019s house. Battling his beliefs and his emotions becomes a complex proposition for a young boy who loves his country so much he has Adolf Hitler (Waititi) as his imaginary friend.\n\nThe film ends up being about humanity shining through during the atrocities of war and learning about what\u2019s good and evil along the way. It also shies away from a lot of the violence audiences have come to expect from World War II films and that\u2019s where Rugrats comes in.\n\nGizmodo was among the journalists in a roundtable interview at Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas last month when Waititi was asked about his choice to keep away from that violence.\n\n\u201cWell, I feel like so many other movies did it better than me, showing the brutality and the atrocities of what happened,\u201d Waititi said. \u201cAnd I also wanted to keep it... It\u2019s like Rugrats...\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother big influence on your work,\u201d co-star Stephen Merchant interjected as everyone laughed. Fear not, Waititi went on to explain how a movie about Nazis compares to a \u201890s animated show about talking babies with the surname Pickles.\n\n\u201cI want [it] to feel more from a kid\u2019s point of view and how they interpret some of these things,\u201d Waititi explained. \u201cWhen I was a child, seeing violence and things in my life, my memories of them are not accurate. I think they\u2019ve been put through a child\u2019s filter where they feel more cinematic sometimes or they feel like pieces of art or cartoonish. And so I wanted to kind of keep some sort of innocence around that stuff and not to be gratuitous.\u201d\n\nThis is why, in the film, much of the violence is seen off-screen and even some of the violent images on-screen are not front and centre. That\u2019s a dichotomy that, yes, may bring to mind something like Rugrats where the story is told through a baby\u2019s perspective. However, it\u2019s also a good visual representation of Waititi\u2019s films as a whole. Films that can\u2019t really be seen in just one way.\n\n\u201cI think [finding that tonal balance] makes it harder in some ways to describe my films to people,\u201d Waititi said. \u201cWith the exception of maybe [What We Do In the] Shadows, none of them are pure comedies [and] none of them are pure dramas. They\u2019re always a mix and they go back and forth.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t go back and forth between wanting to see Jojo Rabbit or not. It\u2019s an excellent film and it opens December 26.", "description": "On a long, long, long list of films or TV shows that writer-director Taika Waititi could have listed as influences on his new film, Jojo Rabbit, one you never, ever would have thought of is Rugrats.
