The least-expensive 2019 Ferrari model is the Portofino with a MSRP of $214,533 (R3 million) and the Lamborghini Urus has a base price $200,000 (R2.8 million).\n\nThe sleek vehicles looked similar to the authentic ones and included badges and seats embroidered with the car companies' logos.\n\nPolice delegate Angelo Fragelli told Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo that the mechanical parts came from old cars, such as the engine of a Chevrolet Omega. Authorities are still looking into how many sham vehicles were made.\n\nThe raid comes just a few weeks after an Italian court recognised the Ferrari 250 GTO as a work of art, protecting it from reproductions, according to The Telegraph. Only a few dozen of those cars were made during a two-year period in the early 1960s. One Ferrari 250 GTO sold at auction in 2018 for $48 million (R673 million).\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Police in southern Brazil raided a factory that was building knock-off Lamborghinis and Ferraris and selling them for 1/5th of the price.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2788/56d67272c9b541d5987d0e345d00b2cb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-18"}
