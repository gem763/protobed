It is about protecting the very heart of democracy itself from a dangerous authoritarian demagoguery that threatens the entire planet.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s regime seems to be openly at war with planet earth. When Green Party MP Caroline Lucas challenged the prime minister to distance Britain from Brazilian leader Bolsonaro due to his \u201cacceleration\u201d of the devastating fires in the Amazon, Boris refused to rule out a trade deal with Brazil.\n\nJohnson\u2019s intransigence is no surprise. The parliamentary Science and Technology Select Committee has warned that precisely due to the Conservative government\u2019s own policies, Britain is on course to miss its own legally-binding target for net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

British investment giant Schroders warns that such a scenario, if pursued worldwide, could lead global average temperatures to rise by as much as 8 degrees Celsius within 80 years \u2013 creating a catastrophically uninhabitable planet.\n\nBut Johnson\u2019s government is, in my view, the least willing to take any action against climate change. Apart from Johnson himself, both his environment minister Theresa Villiers and his business secretary Andrea Leadsom have previously supported the ramping up of shale gas fracking.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Many argued that the campaigns were characterised by racist and Islamophobic xenophobia as their principal weapon of control, as well as digital and psychological manipulation.\n\nIn this context, Johnson\u2019s racist comments regarding Muslim women appeal to the basest of instincts, just like when Nigel Farage stood in front of his infamously fraudulent anti-migrant Brexit poster.\n\nJohnson is the man who secretly sought advice from Donald Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, as part of the latter\u2019s bid to build a pan-European alliance of far-right xenophobes. Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, believes that genetics are more important than teaching when it comes to schooling. His head of digital, Chloe Westley, was not only a \u201cYoung Influencer\u2019\u201dat Turning Point UK (whose US originators have a consistent history of racism), she also once described as a \"hero\" For Britain party chief Anne Marie Waters \u2013 a far-right ideologue with direct ties to the racial separatist group Generation Identity.\n\nAnd so the vision that Boris and his clique represent is plain (for some of us) to see. They appear to be unabashed authoritarians, and their grand scheme consists of austerity for the poor, welfare for the wealthy and marginalisation for minorities.\n\nIn the face of this onslaught, the most pivotal institution of British democracy, parliament, has offered a valiant last stand. For all that might be said of the problems and limitations of one of the oldest continuous representative assemblies in the world, this embattled institution has, so far, successfully fended off Johnson\u2019s attempted crackdown on the upsurge of dissent from across the political spectrum, including from within his own party.\n\nNo one can say that democracy is dead. But the fight is not yet won. If we are to save ourselves and our planet, we must strengthen and protect the core institutions of democracy against those who wish to undermine it for their own gain.\n\nDr Nafeez Ahmed is a systems theorist and author of 'Failing States, Collapsing Systems: BioPhysical Triggers of Political Violence' (Springer).
