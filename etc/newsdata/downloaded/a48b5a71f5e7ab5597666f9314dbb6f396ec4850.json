We tried to keep him in that 30-minute range, 35 \u2013 we could have gone to 35 if we'd wanted to,\" Rivers said.\n\n\"Honestly, I didn't think we were going to win the game. We could have kept him in, but 35 is a lot of minutes. We could play him [for] that if we want; I just chose not to.\n\n\"I'm not going to keep him out there when we're not playing right as a group. Why keep him out there?\"\n\nHe added: \"We never made a run. It's called a fake run. It's what you do in the NBA.\n\n\"You're down by 12, you cut it to seven, everybody thinks you made a run, and then they make a wide-open three \u2013 like they've been doing all game \u2013 and the run's over. I never thought we were a threat.\"\n\nGiving an assessment of the game as a whole, Rivers paid tribute to the Suns.\n\n\"Listen, even if we had won the game, we had no business winning that game,\" he said. \"They just played so much harder, they were so much more committed to what they were doing.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"In every aspect of the game, I thought they were better. Monty [Williams, Suns coach] did a better job. They just really deserved to win the game.\n\n\"I thought offensively \u2013 we had, what, eight assists at half-time \u2013 we've been a ball-moving team and we didn't move the ball. But give them credit \u2013 I thought a lot of that was clearly their ball pressure.\n\n\"I thought [Jevon] Carter did an amazing job defensively. He just put pressure on everybody. That's what Proviso East kids do, for the record, and he did it. He was absolutely fabulous. I thought [Devin] Booker kept his composure.\n\n\"There were a lot of fouls called. We got a lot of them in the first half and you know the old human nature thing: in the second half, it's going to get even somehow. We had a penalty within two minutes. That was troublesome.\n\n\"But other than that, we deserved to lose. We really did. Give them credit.\"", "description": "Kawhi Leonard could have played 35 minutes but did not as the Los Angeles Clippers were not going to win, says Doc Rivers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.RW_GZQJJ1DPfeZl6cBwwA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LhjYWb0yXXV8sBFBQwtq9g--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/8459ab275034fd97e7eebe3e66050c6e", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
