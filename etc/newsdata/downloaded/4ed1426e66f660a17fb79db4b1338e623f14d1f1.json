But really, the competition is mere window dressing for the costumes, which are elaborate, weird, and oddly specific this coming season, given that one person is competing as \u201cEgg.\u201d\n\nAll of The Masked Singer\u2019s costumes are created by in-house designer Marina Toybina, who has won four Emmys, one of which was for designing the viral shark costumes at Katy Perry\u2019s Super Bowl performance. Going into the show\u2019s second season, Toybina told Vulture that the main goal was to \u201celevate the overall construction of the costumes, as well as the characters\u201d in an entertaining way. This means, in addition to costumes riffing on creatures like pandas and eagles, there are some real off-the-wall selections, including the famous Egg, as well as an ice-cream cone, some sexy insects, and a mysterious being known as the Thingamajig.\n\nToybina broke down the backstories to each in detail with Vulture, but before we get to that, a little background. While the costumes are pretty complex, Toybina says the production only has about three-to-four months to design them. The team spends about a month creating artwork, in this case sending 25 to 27 sketches to Fox, which they narrow down to 16 to 18 selections brought back to the singers. This season, there are 16 contestants, up from last year\u2019s 12, and they each get a say in which characters they like \u2014 even proposing changes to fit their own personalities and backstories. Then, it\u2019s a month and a half of construction. \u201cThat becomes the most challenging creative part for me,\u201d Toybina said. \u201cIt\u2019s great once it\u2019s on paper and everything looks magical, but then, how do you make these pieces become life-sized and also wearable art?\u201d\n\nEgg\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\nThis, as Toybina puts it, is \u201cone of the most interesting ones.\u201d \u201cThe idea first started where the talent just wanted to be an egg,\u201d she said, \u201cand of course, I don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d So she decided to come up with several different ways to represent an egg within one costume: there\u2019s the actual mask, which resembles a boiled egg; the detailing on the breastplate, which is meant to resemble a Faberg\u00e9 egg; a coat that is cracked like an eggshell; and finally, a fried egg that the Egg is wearing as a hat, which came out of Toybina\u2019s desire to make something that was somewhere between the runway and Lady Gaga, \u201cdiva-esque and extravagant.\u201d\n\nTree\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\nAs with Egg, this extremely happy tree is one of the season\u2019s most surprising concepts. \u201cIt was hands-on experiments and following our gut instincts,\u201d Toybina said. \u201cWhat can we do that\u2019s different? What can we do that hasn\u2019t been done before? What can fabric do?\u201d\n\nIce Cream\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\nFor the second season, Toybina wanted to be more ambitious with the costumes, which meant adding elements like the melting ice cream that appears on top of this singer\u2019s body. The melted ice cream and chocolate are made out of the same material as the head, which was sculpted out of foam and then waxed onto the shoulder. \u201cThose are the key details that really pushed us over the edge with season two,\u201d she said.\n\nLeopard\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\nIn a little bit of a Cate Blanchett moment, we have the Leopard, who\u2019s wearing a big, costume-drama-ready collar. \u201cMost people would expect [a leopard costume] to be very animalistic and have print all over,\u201d Toybina said. \u201cI wanted to create something that was Victorian and was vintage and did have this big presence onstage.\u201d To do that, she wanted to create both a striking costume and give the mask bright-green eyes that would \u201cdemand a stage presence immediately.\u201d\n\nFox\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\nSimilar instincts took hold in the making of the Fox costume, which comes with a steampunk-like vibe. \u201cWe try to be as experimental as possible,\u201d Toybina said. \u201cWhat hasn\u2019t been done? What would we like to see that\u2019s very different for this character?\u201d\n\nPanda\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\nFor the Panda, Toybina wanted to embrace a playful vibe and also create a look that would appeal to kids watching the show. The jewelry is inspired by gumball machines, while the clothing is meant to have a Japanese-inspired fashion feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s a Chinese animal, but it\u2019s very Harajuku-ish as far as clothing,\u201d Toybina said.\n\nButterfly\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\nWith this one, we go from goofy to skintight. \u201cI decided to hand-bead and hand-stone the entire costume,\u201d Toybina said. \u201cAs much as there\u2019s a little bit of that sex appeal and darkness to the costume, onstage it really becomes the beauty of what a butterfly represents.\u201d\n\nBlack Widow\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\nIn a design that recalls the costumes of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, Toybina wanted to experiment with \u201ctexture and movement.\u201d \u201cInstead of just creating a dark character with red accents, I wanted this to be something that\u2019s sleek and powerful onstage,\u201d she said. The character comes with a crown-like head, as well as a collection of spider legs. The head is also meant to be less elaborate to ensure the whole outfit is not too hard to move in. \u201cBeing able to carry that many parts of the costume,\u201d Toybina said, \u201cyou want to be very smart about the size and the weight of the mask.\u201d\n\nFlamingo\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\nThe Flamingo costume extends above the performer, so they actually see out of a peephole in the bird\u2019s neck. Toybina thought it would be fun to play with height on this design, given what a flamingo actually looks like, and given how it\u2019ll also confuse people trying to guess a singer\u2019s identity. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at somebody you know that\u2019s possible six inches taller,\u201d she said. \u201cIt becomes even more of a guessing game.\u201d\n\nEagle\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\nHere, we\u2019ve got a bunch of Americana references drawn from a 1970s rock-and-roll vibe, specifically Bruce Springsteen and Jimi Hendrix. \u201cI toned it down in my coloring so it\u2019s not like a psychedelic bird,\u201d Toybina said, \u201cbut at the same time, it has a little bit of that hippie, free-spirit kind of expression.\u201d\n\nSkeleton\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very much inspired by Tim Burton,\u201d Toybina said. \u201cI wanted to create something that wasn\u2019t a scary skeleton, or something that people right away would turn their heads because it represents death or darkness.\u201d Instead, we have a very upbeat skeleton, with a top hat and gold accents made out of foam for ease of movement.\n\nFlower\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\nIn this costume, as well as the Ladybug below, Toybina wanted to experiment with new approaches to mask design, to \u201cplay around with an idea of a face rather than just a character.\u201d The mask sits inside a \u201ctheatrical environment,\u201d as Toybina puts it, made up of petals. In making these masks, she also has to take acoustics into consideration, testing out the costumes with a vocal coach during fittings to make sure the singer could still hear everyone clearly.\n\nLadybug\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\nThis was one of the season\u2019s most labor-intensive costumes, and it was also the last one Fox debuted, bringing out the Ladybug on Emmys night. \u201cI wanted to represent more volume around the entire body,\u201d Toybina said, which meant building out lots of detailing on the bug\u2019s body, but keeping the face area relatively simple. \u201cFor safety purposes alone, we definitely went down on the actual mask so that it was as tight to the face as possible,\u201d Toybina said, \u201cso the rest of the costume was distributed based on mass and volume.\u201d\n\nRottweiler\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\nTo mix things up even more, Toybina wanted to put the focus most clearly on the mask here, rather than the rest of the relatively simple costume. \u201cThe talent that went into this costume wanted to be able to move and dance around onstage,\u201d Toybina said. \u201cThe street-inspired route was the perfect way to go, so that there is mobility and accessibility to the costume, but then the mask itself carries the character.\u201d\n\nPenguin\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\n\u201cBecause the penguin is black and white, it\u2019s very typical to put it in a suit,\u201d Toybina said, so instead she went in a different direction, taking inspiration from \u201cthe idea of the samurai\u201d and also giving the penguin a \u201ctriple-tail coat kind of effect.\u201d She was particularly pleased with the idea of chroming the mask in silver, similar to last season\u2019s Lion mask, which was done in gold. \u201cThe entire aura of the Penguin came alive when we did something different and created the industrial elements to it,\u201d Toybina said.\n\nThingamajig\n\nPhoto: FOX\n\nThis costume, which is not meant to represent asparagus, came out of \u201cneeding nothing but pure creativity.\u201d Toybina wanted to create an eccentric, unique character with an elaborate mask, like the Monster last season, which meant balancing the design with a more simple costume.", "description": "The Masked Singer\u2019s costume designer breaks down season 2\u2019s many new looks, from the Egg to the Flower to the Thingamajig.", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/24/masked-singer/24-the-masked-singer.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
