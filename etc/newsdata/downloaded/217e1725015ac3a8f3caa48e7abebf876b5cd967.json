Before his death he\u2019d requested that his arm and back tats be surgically removed and framed.\n\n\u201cWhen my husband passed away, half of me passed away with him,\u201d Cheryl recalled.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. I just knew he wanted this preservation done. I had to set aside my own emotion to get this part done.\u201d\n\nSources: BBC, Mirror, Metro", "description": "Tattoo preservation is just like keeping ashes in an urn \u2013 only, in this case, it\u2019s framed like a piece of art.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9501/dfd4e8ee58c24dd4956f4bfb7296adbf.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
