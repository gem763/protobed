The analogy in middle-school maths is breaking down a big number into its prime factors.\n\nA seminal book co-authored by Professor Praeger in 1990 begins with the simple equation G=AB, where a finite group G is said to be factorisable to some subgroups A and B, and proceeds to map out the maximal factorisation of all finite simple groups and their automorphism groups.\n\nSymmetry in the natural world is important because it signifies \"health and regularity\", Professor Praeger explains. Organisms that possess it, whether they be viruses or plants, tend to enjoy a \"genetic economy\" that allow them to function at a highly efficient rate.\n\nThis quality, which the professor terms \"beauty\" and \"simplicity,\" is also a prized quality in the source code for technologies such as search engines, secure communications and quantum computing.\n\nThe precise applications of pure maths in these fields remains unclear. But the race to develop technological capability, especially in areas with military applications, has already begun.\n\nIn 2018, top Pentagon official Michael Hayduck said, \"the Airforce is taking [quantum computing] very seriously, and we've invested for quite a while\". Reports that China last year registered 517 patents related to quantum technology, compared to the United States' 117, sparked speculations about a new \"arms race\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuantum computers are made of atom-based quantum bits, which unlike classical data bits can represent 0 and 1 at the same time. Their capacity for much faster computation than regular processors has been tipped to have wide-ranging consequences for future cyber and space warfare.\n\nProfessor Praeger, who serves on the International Science Council's committee on freedom and responsibility, says she favours dialogue between the government and scientists to establish an \"ethical standard\" for these emerging fields.\n\nDespite the potential dangers, she remains excited by the mathematical challenges that the advent of quantum computing will unleash.\n\n\"The best we can do is to bring the strongest skills that we can to bear on these questions,\" the mathematician says.\n\n'Part of creation'\n\nOn the age-old question of whether mathematicians discover or create phenomena, Professor Praeger, who describes herself as a \"person of faith\", sides with the discoverers.\n\n\"This is not necessarily a Christian point of view but a personal one,\" she says. \"To me, mathematics feels like discovering a part of creation.\"\n\nThe Toowoomba-born mathematician's career was almost derailed after she graduated high school, when a career adviser told her that \"girls don't pass [maths courses]\" and that she should instead consider nursing or teaching.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProfessor Praeger ignored the advice, enrolled in mathematics at the University of Queensland, and later won a scholarship for further study at Oxford.\n\nWhen she was offered a full professorship at the University of Western Australia in 1983, she became the second female maths professor at an Australian university and the second woman professor on the UWA faculty.\n\nHer students have included Akshay Venkatesh, the Princeton University mathematician and last year's Fields medallist, whom she taught when he was 13 years old.\n\nIndustry, science and technology minister Karen Andrews highlighted that five of this year's science award recipients were women, noting the increase from one in 2018. \"I hope this will inspire even more girls and women to be involved in STEM,\" Ms Andrews said.\n\nThe prime minister's prize for innovation, also valued at $250,000 and announced on Wednesday, went to David Huang, Peter Czabotar, Guillaume Lessene and Andrew Roberts for their work on the anti-cancer drug Venetoclax.\n\nLife scientist Laura Mackay, physical scientist Elizabeth New, inventor Luke Campbell, and science teachers Sarah Finney and Samantha Moyle were also recognised at a ceremony hosted by the prime minister and Ms Andrews.", "description": "The winner of the Prime Minister's Prize for Science hopes her groundbreaking work on symmetry will not be used for destructive ends.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.259%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6d4e023f63e438551c43c5305f17d1c212339d56", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
