No matter what \u2013 the only way is standing together as one.\u2019\n\nEmery claimed last week that the decision to freeze Ozil out was one which had the backing of the club\u2019s hierarchy, but he is set to bring him in from the cold, acknowledging the side is lacking some of the German\u2019s creativity and individual brilliance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Yes, tomorrow he\u2019s in the group so he has a chance to play,\u2019 said Emery. \u2018We have had this morning a very good conversation, Mesut and Me, and I said to him I haven\u2019t changed my idea about him. He knows what I want from him because it\u2019s the same as last season in the first day of pre-season training when we had a conversation.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the same as one month ago and in that way, some circumstances weren\u2019t helping us in every moment to be consistent or available to play. But I will say I think the last weeks he has progressively been training well and adding his spirit to help us.\n\n\u2018For example, our conversation this morning was because I wanted to listen to him about how he\u2019s thinking now to help us and be with us tomorrow. Then if we are in the same spirit and the same idea, to play. It was a very good conversation and tomorrow he\u2019s in the group.\n\n\u2018We need his quality, his skill and his consistency. We need his positive mentality and then he will help us on the pitch. That\u2019s the next step. I think he\u2019s done the steps before, and now I want the steps like in pre-season and one month ago to help us on the pitch.\u2019\n\nMORE: Unai Emery reveals Granit Xhaka is \u2018devastated\u2019 after clashing with Arsenal fans\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Emmanuel Petit calls on Unai Emery to remove Granit Xhaka as Arsenal captain after Crystal Palace outburst\n\nMore to follow\u2026", "description": "Mesut Ozil has told Arsenal fans and players to 'stand together as one' as he prepares to make his comeback in tomorrow night's Carabao Cup clash against Liverpool.
