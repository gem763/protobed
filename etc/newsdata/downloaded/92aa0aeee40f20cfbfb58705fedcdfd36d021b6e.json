He had taken issue with inconsistencies in Gonzalez\u2019s strike zone throughout the game.\n\nThe Twins went on to win 8-5, with Montgomery getting the no-decision. After the game, he was very clear about his concerns, calling for an end to home plate umpiring as we know it.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cI think they need to be objective, and if they can\u2019t be, I hate to say it: we\u2019ve got to go to automated [strike] zones,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been one that wants to advocated for that, but after seeing it, I think it\u2019s definitely something that the league should consider.\u201d\n\nRoyals pitcher Mike Montgomery, who was ejected for the first time in his career, was not happy with home plate umpire Manny Gonzalez after the game. pic.twitter.com/je3L9caG36 \u2014 Tyler Mason (@tylermason21) September 20, 2019\n\nMontgomery added that he felt personally targeted by Gonzalez. \u201cWhat really just pissed me off is that it was more like he was intentionally trying to screw me over.\u201d he said. \u201cWhether he was or wasn\u2019t, we\u2019ll never know, because they don\u2019t ever have to talk about it.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nRoyals LHP Mike Montgomery didn\u2019t pull many punches postgame after being ejected by umpire Manny Gonzalez pic.twitter.com/xJdJvjdGpy \u2014 Lynn Worthy (@LWorthySports) September 20, 2019\n\nMontgomery got ejected after giving up his third home run of the night, this time to Mitch Garver, following a couple of very borderline called balls. Earlier at-bats also had some iffy calls \u2013\u2013 but some of those calls went in Montgomery\u2019s favor, as well.\n\nHow do automated strike zones work?\n\nThe league has famously been testing the use of electronic strike zones in the Atlantic League this year, with mixed results.\n\nThe system doesn\u2019t eliminate umpires altogether, however. Instead, the ump still crouches behind the plate, but wears an earpiece connected to an iPhone in his pocket. After a pitch is thrown, the system relays what is communicated to it via the \u201cTrackMan\u201d technology installed behind and above the plate that uses Doppler radar.\n\nElectronic stroke zone technology is yet to be perfected, though. The TrackMan could call a pitch that bounces into the zone a strike, for example, so umpires have the ability to overrule the computer\u2019s call. The live umpire\u2019s view is also required to call check swings.\n\nBecause of the setup, there is also somewhat of a delay compared to a human umpire\u2019s call. That delay was somewhat of a source of frustration in the trial run, but pitchers have been pleased that more high strikes have been called.\n\nMike Montgomery had a rough outing that ended in his first career ejection.
