Any trucking company can register. Uber\u2019s first Canadian delivery partners include Martin Brower, which delivers for McDonald\u2019s and other restaurant chains. The service will launch first in Quebec and Ontario, and will include domestic shipments and those to and from the U.S. (Globe and Mail)\n\nTalking point: Uber has already launched the service in the U.S., Germany and the Netherlands, the result of a US$200-million investment. It\u2019s part of a broader strategy to diversify its business into sectors like food delivery and electric scooters as the ride-hailing market becomes increasingly crowded. Canada has been a testbed for many of Uber\u2019s new endeavors, including Uber Eats, which became the company\u2019s fastest-growing division after it launched in Toronto. Canada\u2019s $39-billion trucking market could be another promising opportunity for a company still establishing its plan to profitability.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
