REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization said on Thursday it welcomed a commitment by Facebook that it would direct users seeking vaccine information on its Instagram, Facebook Search, Groups and other forums towards facts, not misinformation.\n\nAfter several months of talks with the WHO, Facebook has pledged to direct its users to \u201caccurate and reliable vaccine information in several languages\u201d on the WHO\u2019s website, the United Nations health agency said, \u201cto ensure that vital health messages reach people who need them the most\u201d.\n\n\u201cMajor digital organizations have a responsibility to their users - to ensure that they can access facts about vaccines and health,\u201d the WHO said in a statement.\n\n\u201cVaccine misinformation is a major threat to global health that could reverse decades of progress made in tackling preventable diseases,\u201d it said. Deadly infectious diseases such as measles, diphtheria, hepatitis, polio, cholera and yellow fever can all be prevented with immunisation, it noted.\n\nThe WHO says vaccines are one of the most powerful innovations in public health history and estimates that they save at least 2 million lives every year worldwide.\n\nIn addition, immunisation means millions more children avoid becoming infected with debilitating diseases that would result in long hospital stays and time out of school.\n\nBut misinformation about vaccination has spread far on social media in many countries in recent years - including during major vaccination campaigns to prevent polio in Pakistan and to immunize against yellow fever in South America.\n\nWelcoming Facebook\u2019s pledge, the WHO said such moves by social media \u201cmust be matched by tangible steps by governments and the health sector\u201d to promote trust in vaccination and respond to the needs and concerns of parents.", "description": "The World Health Organization said on Thursday it welcomed a commitment by Facebook that it would direct users seeking vaccine information on its Instagram, Facebook Search, Groups and other forums towards facts, not misinformation.", "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426507523&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8410M", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
