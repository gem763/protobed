(NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX) reports consolidated production for Q3 2019 of 35,043 gold ounces and 947,146 silver ounces, or 45,930 gold equivalent ounces(1)(\u201cGEOs\u201d) using the average gold:silver price ratio for Q3 of 87:1. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2019 we have produced 128,125 GEOs, or 74% of our revised guidance midpoint of 172,500 GEOs. Our Gold Bar Mine continued to improve during the third quarter, achieving several key performance benchmarks for ore production, crushing throughput, and gold production. Gold Bar produced almost 5,000 GEOs in September, which is in line with our plan and approaching the designed capacity of the process plant. The San Jos\u00e9 and El Gallo mines performed well, meeting their production targets. At our Black Fox Mine, underground mining operations continued to be challenging, however high-grade exploration results at both the Black Fox and Stock properties are providing reason for excitement for the future. The latest exploration drilling from Stock East returned impressive intercepts, such as: 83.5 g/t gold over 5.6 m, including 417 g/t over 1.1 m; and 34.7 g/t gold over 5.9 m, including 74.1 g/t over 2.7 m (news release dated September 30, 2019).\n\n\n\nTable 1 - Consolidated Production Summary\n\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Full Year 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019\n\nGuidance Gold (oz) 35,069 26,938 36,959 36,216 33,806 35,043 135,203 131,000-138,000 Silver (oz) 695,651 703,219 772,432 850,525 745,172 947,146 3,032,694 3,225,000 GEOs(1) 44,344 36,315 47,258 45,881 43,742 45,930 175,640 169,000-176,000\n\n(1) 'Gold Equivalent Ounces' are calculated based on a 75:1 gold to silver price ratio for periods up to and including Q1 2019, 88:1 for Q2 2019, and 87:1 for Q3 2019. 2019 GEO Guidance assumes a 85:1 ratio.\n\nRob McEwen, Chairman and Chief Owner commented: \u201cExploration continued to shine this quarter with Stock and Grey Fox drill results returning multi-ounce gold intersections at relatively shallow depths. In Nevada, our Gold Bar Mine produced almost 5,000 ounces of gold in September. Drilling at Gold Bar South returned several new drill holes showing broad intervals of grades better than twice that of the current resource, which should enhance the project\u2019s economics. Our focus is on exploration to grow our production and extend the life of our mines.\u201d\n\nGold Bar Mine, Nevada (100%)\n\nGold Bar produced 11,029 gold ounces in Q3. Since reaching commercial production during Q2, the mine has been able to reach several operational benchmarks, and gold output is increasing during the second half of 2019.\n\nOur 2019 exploration budget for the Gold Bar property is $5 million, with a focus on near surface oxide and deep sulphide targets. Drilling at Gold Bar South has successfully defined additional mineralization that is expected to increase our gold resource and reserve base and extend the Gold Bar Mine\u2019s life. The updated resource and reserve for Gold Bar South will be released in early 2020. Subject to permitting advancing as planned, mining at Gold Bar South could begin in early 2021.\n\nOur deep drilling program has begun to test for deep sulfide gold targets similar to Barrick Gold\u2019s latest discoveries Gold Rush and Fourmile, which are located on trend 25 miles North of the Gold Bar property. Two deep holes are planned this year to test for higher-grade gold mineralization at depth. The first deep drill hole is completed and was a geological success, as it confirmed the presence of the right host rock units over a large intercept of 1,217 ft. (370 m), which contained anomalous gold-pathfinder elements and alteration indicating hydrothermal fluid movement through the rock formation, but it did not contain any gold values. A second deep hole, located 3.2 miles (5.2 km) East of the first, is in progress.\n\nBlack Fox Mine, Timmins, Canada (100%)\n\nBlack Fox produced 7,421 gold ounces in Q3. Production was below our expectations, primarily because of insufficient working areas and delays in advancing underground development.\n\nOur 2019 exploration budget for the Black Fox Complex is $18 million and includes surface and underground drilling. Drilling started in April and there are currently 14 surface rigs and one dedicated underground rig actively exploring on the Black Fox and Stock properties. The best results are coming from the Stock Property, where our mill is located, and the Grey Fox deposit area at the Black Fox Property, where exploration is adding to already significant gold resources. Underground drilling at the Black Fox Mine is focusing on resource development along the western flank of the mine and at depth below 900 m.\n\nSan Jos\u00e9 Mine, Santa Cruz, Argentina (49%(2))\n\nSan Jos\u00e9 is on-track to achieve our full year guidance for 2019 of 49,000 gold ounces and 3,225,000 silver ounces. Our attributable production from San Jos\u00e9 in Q3 was 13,575 gold ounces and 943,037 silver ounces, for a total of 24,415 GEOs. Exploration at San Jos\u00e9 is focusing on San Jos\u00e9 South and Aguas Vivas, a poly-metallic sulfide deposit with gold, silver, lead and zinc about 8 km from the mine. In Q4, exploration is also planned in areas surrounding Newmont Goldcorp\u2019s Cerro Negro Mine, which produced 490,000 ounces of gold in 2018.\n\nEl Gallo Project, Sinaloa, Mexico (100%)\n\nEl Gallo is expected to produce 16,000 gold ounces in 2019. It produced 3,018 gold ounces in Q3 from residual leaching of the heap leach pad.\n\nThird Quarter Financial Results\n\nOperating costs for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 will be released with our 10-Q Quarterly Financial Statements at the end of October.\n\nABOUT MCEWEN MINING\n\nMcEwen Mining is a diversified gold and silver producer and explorer with operating mines in Nevada, Canada, Mexico and Argentina.
