It is a key drainage basin for the eastern side of Antarctica and it is enormous \u2013 the whole icesheet is 60,000 sq km (23,000 square miles) and water reaches over 550km (340 miles) beneath it.\n\nHelen Amanda Fricker, a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, tweeted that the calving was \u201clike expecting a baby tooth to come out, and instead out comes a molar.\u201d\n\nShe added that it was \u201cimportant to remember that this calving event is part of a healthy ice shelf cycle.\u201d\n\nProf Fricker had originally expected loose tooth to break free from the Amery Ice Shelf sometime between 2010 and 2015, according to a study she published in 2002. Large calving events such as this are typically observed every 50-60 years.\n\nProf Fricker told the BBC there was no link between the creation of this iceberg and climate change.\n\nSatellite data studied since the 1990s indicates the Amery Ice Sheet is still roughly in balance with its surroundings, despite experiencing strong surface melt in summer.\n\n\u201cWhile there is much to be concerned about in Antarctica, there is no cause for alarm yet for this particular ice shelf,\u201d she said.", "description": "An enormous slice of ice, weighing around 315bn tons has snapped off Antarctica and is floating in the Southern Ocean.
