In fact, the two actors totally forgot it was their anniversary.\n\nOn Monday, Bell wrote on Instagram that she and her husband didn\u2019t realize the date had come and gone until some of their loved ones reached out to them.\n\n\u201cWe were reminded by family and friends that at some point last week, it was our 5-year wedding anniversary,\u201d the \u201cFrozen 2\u201d star wrote. \u201cIn truth, neither of us remember which day.\u201d\n\n(One of Bell\u2019s Instagram followers pointed out in the comments that this was actually the couple\u2019s sixth, not fifth, anniversary, which only served to further prove her point. She and Shepard were married on Oct. 17, 2013.)\n\nBut the two weren\u2019t kicking themselves over the blunder. In truth, Bell declared, it revealed just how in love and compatible they really are.\n\n\u201cThats because we have been living the celebration of our commitment every moment since,\u201d she wrote of why they forgot their anniversary. \u201cI find when you are living with gratitude each moment, the dates become irrelevant. To get to wake up next to someone who has put hard work, respectful fights, patience, understanding and gratitude into your relationship is the definition of love.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will never remember the date of our anniversary @daxshepard, and i know you wont either,\u201d Bell added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just one more thing i love about us.\u201d\n\nThe couple started dating in 2007 after meeting at a dinner party and hitting it off at a hockey game a few weeks later. In 2013, they tied the knot at a Beverly Hills, California, courthouse in a no-frills ceremony that cost just $142. They are parents to two daughters: Lincoln, 6, and Delta, 4.\n\nLater on Monday, the \u201cGood Place\u201d star posted a sweet photo taken shortly after she and Shepard realized they had missed their anniversary.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the morning we both got texts from grandma saying \u2018happy anniversary!\u2019\u201d Bell wrote. \u201cWe were both on our way out the door but stopped for a quick hot and heavy make out sesh while Frank stood close like a creeper.\u201d\n\nThough these two clearly share a deep love and healthy admiration for one another, they\u2019re also honest about the hard work it\u2019s taken for them to get to this place.\n\n\u201cAll these movies from the \u201980s taught us that it\u2019s love at first sight, and it is supposed to be easy and [that] all you have to do is find that person,\u201d Bell told People in March. \u201cIt took me a while to realize, \u2018Oh, that was such a lie,\u2019 because things that you work really, really, really hard for always yield the best results.\u201d\n\nPart of what\u2019s kept them together through some of the rocky periods in their relationship is couples therapy, both Bell and Shepard have said.", "description": "\u201cI find when you are living with gratitude each moment, the dates become irrelevant,\u201d the \u201cFrozen 2\u201d actor wrote on Instagram.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter", "Huffpost Life"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dae32ce200000881c50658c.png?cache=nbJPAQKqi2&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
