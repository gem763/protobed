Thompson, filed a lawsuit Aug. 14 against Crown Hill Cemetery, after cemetery officials objected to the proposed exhumation.\n\nThompson is one of two Dillinger relatives who sought a state permit to exhume the gravesite, saying they have evidence that Dillinger\u2019s body may not be buried there and that he may not have been the man FBI agents fatally shot outside a Chicago theater on July 22, 1934. That permit was approved in July.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The Associated Press on Wednesday left a message seeking comment from Thompson\u2019s attorney.\n\nThe state permit issued for Dillinger\u2019s grave lists a Sept. 16 exhumation \u2014 and under that permit the grave would have to exhumed and reinterred on that date, said agency spokeswoman Megan Wade-Taxter.\n\nIf Dillinger\u2019s grave is not exhumed on that date, another state permit would have to be obtained, Wade-Taxter said Wednesday. No applications for another exhumation date have been filed, she said. \u201cJust because a permit for disinterment has been issued, the exhumation doesn\u2019t have to occur. We have no involvement in whether the applicant follows through with the exhumation,\u201d she said.\n\nCrown Hill Cemetery management said in a statement in August that it objected to the exhumation of Dillinger\u2019s grave, in part because it was concerned that \u201cthe complex and commercial nature of this exhumation could cause disruption to the peaceful tranquility of the cemetery\u201d and people visiting the graves of loved ones.\n\nA few days after his 1934 burial, Dillinger\u2019s father had his casket covered with a protective cap of concrete and scrap iron topped by four reinforced-concrete slabs to prevent vandals from trying to dig him up, according to Susan Sutton, a historian with the Indiana Historical Society.\n\nDillinger\u2019s great-nephew, Jeff Scalf, has opposed the grave\u2019s exhumation, saying he\u2019s certain Dillinger is buried in the grave marked with his name. Scalf said Wednesday that he hopes the exhumation does not proceed and that no additional permit is sought. He said his grandmother, Doris, who was Dillinger\u2019s half-sister, \u201cwould have been shocked and appalled\u201d by the efforts to exhume him.\n\n\u201cShe would have found this reprehensible. She would have been shocked at even the idea of doing this,\u201d he said.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The documentary was to feature a proposed exhumation of Dillinger's grave sought by relatives who question whether he's truly buried there.", "authors": ["Rick Callahan"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/john-dillinger-exhumed.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C118px%2C1589px%2C832px&resize=1200%2C628&strip"}
