Prices ranged from about $70 to $430, according to the Globe and Mail. (The National/CBC Archives)\n\nThe personal stereo was a cassette deck that was small enough to slip into a large pocket or a purse.\n\nIt was plugged in to a set of small, lightweight headphones that covered the ear and delivered \"high-quality sound,\" according to Keddy.\n\nAccording to the Globe and Mail on Dec. 17, 1981, Sony expected to sell 50,000 units of its Walkman 2 model in Canada that year. Its retail price was $280 (about $760 in 2019 dollars).\n\nEarly adopters took their music out for a run, a bike ride or to the gym.\n\n\"You can observe everything but you're not really part of it,\" noted student Tawny Millett, describing the experience of listening to a personal stereo. (The National/CBC Archives)\n\nBut listeners liked their personal stereos not just because they could take their music with them.\n\n\"It puts you kind of out of touch with what's going on,\" explained Toronto student Tawni Millett. \"I like it. It makes you feel anonymous.\"\n\nOther students described using a pocket stereo as \"an escape\" and something whose appeal lay in not \"having the noise of the world around you.\"\n\nA 'soundwave into your head'\n\nConcerned about the effect a pocket stereo might have on her teenage son's hearing, this mother made him return the one he'd bought. (The National/CBC Archives)\n\nA couple interviewed on the street said they worried about the potential for damage to one's hearing.\n\nKeddy explained that they had forced their teenage son to return his pocket stereo.\n\n\"My concern was basically medical,\" said the boy's mother. \"I just can't see that ... putting a soundwave directly into your head can be good for you.\"\n\nBut Don Lamont, owner of a personal stereo, dismissed the idea.\n\n\"You can put your head beside a speaker and turn it up just as loud and destroy your hearing,\" he pointed out.", "description": "A portable cassette deck with featherweight headphones made listening a truly personal experience in 1981.", "authors": ["Cbc Archives"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5299968.1569599819!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/personal-stereo-user.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
