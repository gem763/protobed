REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo\n\nMediaset (MS.MI) this month won shareholder approval to create a pan-European media group in an effort to pursue continental alliances with rivals and fend off growing competition from streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX.O) or Amazon Prime Video (AMZN.O).\n\nBut Vivendi (VIV.PA), which has plans of its own to build a European media powerhouse, opposed the reorganization saying it strengthens the hold on the group of Mediaset\u2019s top shareholder, the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.\n\nVivendi could have scuppered Mediaset\u2019s plans had it decided to sell its 29% holding back to the Italian group by a deadline of midnight on Saturday.\n\nSources familiar with the matter told Reuters the French media giant decided to hold on to its stake and fight the corporate revamp in court.\n\nMediaset said on Monday Vivendi had brought legal proceedings against a shareholder meeting of its Spanish unit that earlier this month approved the merger with its parent into a Dutch holding.\n\nIt said Vivendi had also filed proceedings in the Netherlands to stop the Dutch holding introducing a number of by-laws, including one relating to special voting shares.\n\nMediaset and Vivendi have been locked in a legal battle since falling out over a failed pay-TV deal back in 2016.\n\nAfter the aborted deal, the French conglomerate owned by billionaire Vincent Bollore built up a 29% stake in Mediaset - a holding the Italian group deems illegitimate.\n\nVivendi could have derailed Mediaset\u2019s revamp had it decided to liquidate its holding, which is worth more than the 180 million euros Mediaset was prepared to spend to mop up shares of investors who wanted to cash out.\n\nSelling the stake would have translated into a loss of around 320 million euros for the French group.\n\nTo hedge against this possibility, Mediaset last week struck a deal with private equity firm Peninsula, which agreed a backstop worth up to 1 billion euros, neutralizing Vivendi\u2019s withdrawal risk.\n\nSome sources have said in the past Bollore might prefer to remain an investor in the hope that court rulings in his favor could eventually allow him to increase his sway over Mediaset.\n\nMediaset shares closed down 1.2% at 2.728 euros each, below the price of 2.77 euros a share at which Vivendi had the right to liquidate its stake.", "description": "Vivendi is taking legal action against Mediaset's plans to reshape its future after deciding to hold on to its stake in the Italian broadcaster after a deadline to sell expired.", "authors": ["Elvira Pollina", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432912347&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0OK", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
