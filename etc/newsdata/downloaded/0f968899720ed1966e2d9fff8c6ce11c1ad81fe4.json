Spectators were kept away due to safety concerns after almost 10-inches of rain saturated the area on Friday.\n\nAs if on auto pilot, he still waved after his seven birdies and provided a little showmanship when walking in some putts.\n\nThe grandstands were empty on Saturday (Lee Jin-man/AP)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised that I was able to score as well as I have. Usually that takes a little bit of time,\u201d Woods told the PGA tour website.\n\n\u201cBut this golf course is a little bit on the softer side. I\u2019ve been able to strike my irons pretty well this week so far and that\u2019s been nice.\n\n\u201cI left a lot of my approach shots below the hole and I was able to be pretty aggressive, and the greens are a little bit slower than they were yesterday.\n\n\u201cI had a good feel on the putting green, which was nice. Hit a lot of putts from below the hole and making sure that I put a lot of right hand into it and released it and it felt good all day.\u201d", "description": "Woods is one win away from equalling Sam Snead\u00b4s record of 82 PGA Tour titles.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/11/wire-20213790-1572087250-807_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
