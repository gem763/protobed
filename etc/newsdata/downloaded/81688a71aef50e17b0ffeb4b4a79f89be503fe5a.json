Just give us a bit of time \u2026 We need a law that defends and protects our values,\u201d he said.\n\nThe proposed new law is the latest setback for LGBTI rights in Africa. In May, Kenya\u2019s high court rejected an attempt to repeal colonial-era laws criminalising gay sex.\n\nHomosexuality is illegal in most countries on the African continent. In a handful of states, gay people face life imprisonment or the death penalty. In Uganda, a largely conservative Christian country, homosexual sex is punishable by life imprisonment.\n\nAfter initially indicating it might support the move, the government has backed away from supporting any change to the law after major aid donors expressed their concerns.\n\nDon Wanyama, the senior press secretary of the president, Yoweri Museveni, said: \u201cWe have the penal code that already handles issues of unnatural sexual behaviour, so there is no law coming up.\u201d\n\nSimon Lokodo, Uganda\u2019s state minister for ethics and integrity, said the bill had his personal backing. \u201cCertainly I support the bill. We can\u2019t allow the recruitment and promotion of homosexuality in Uganda. It\u2019s [a] principle,\u201d he said.\n\nLokodo has previously described homosexuality as \u201cnot natural to Ugandans\u201d and claimed there was \u201ca massive recruitment [campaign in schools]\u201d.\n\nBackers of the proposed new law say it would target the \u201cpromotion\u201d of homosexuality.\n\nHate crimes against gay people, including physical and sexual assault, blackmail and extortion, are common in Uganda but most victims are too fearful to go to the police, according to rights groups.\n\nCampaigners say existing laws are also used to discriminate against LGBT people, making it harder for them to get a job or promotion, rent housing or access health and education services. Many flee to neighbouring countries where discrimination, though still acute, is less severe.\n\nEarlier this month, Brian Wassa, a gay activist and paralegal, died of injuries sustained in an attack at his home in Jinja, eastern Uganda. Wassa is the fourth LGBTI activist to have been killed in the past three months, say campaigners.\n\nNicholas Opiyo, a Kampala-based human rights lawyer, said Ugandan politicians were making \u201ccareless remarks that have real-life implications for hundreds of Uganda\u2019s LGBTQI community, who are already facing grave societal dangers\u201d.\n\nAmnesty International warned the attempt to change the law would create more hatred in a homophobic environment.\n\nUganda\u2019s parliament is in recess but those backing new legislation will seek permission to introduce a bill when lawmakers next meet at the end of the month.\n\nClare Byarugaba, an LGBT activist based in Kampala, the capital, said it would be wrong to underestimate the resilience and strength of the gay community in Uganda. \u201cWe fought so hard against legalised homophobia and discrimination [in 2014], and we shall do the same if they introduce another law,\u201d she said.\n\nClaims that homosexuality is un-African are common on the continent, though contradicted by many historians and experts.\n\nIn Kenya, judges said existing laws on homosexuality represented the values and views of the country. In Tanzania, authorities in Dar es Salaam, the biggest city, have launched crackdowns on gay people in the past few years. In the most recent, the city\u2019s governor called on citizens to identify gay people so they could be arrested, forcing hundreds into hiding.\n\nHowever, there has been progress elsewhere, including Angola, which decriminalised gay sex in January. In March, the high court in Botswana heard a case brought by campaigners challenging the constitutionality of a law punishing same-sex relations.\n\nEarlier this year, Brunei caused an international outcry over plans to impose the death penalty for gay sex, backtracking only after intense global criticism.", "description": "Parliamentarians seek to resubmit bill to introduce capital sentences for gay sex", "authors": ["Jason Burke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d871292a17c5a0b71602766969fa8c6c4367e4a/0_34_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2778d400754d68665023f70a9fadd9e2", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
