South Korea's Kospi index fell 0.11%.\n\nAustralia's S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.3% as most sectors traded lower. But the energy subindex added 0.59% as energy names in the country gained.\n\nOil remains in focus after prices surged in the previous session. West Texas Intermediate futures gained more than 14%, notching its biggest one-day gain since 2008. International benchmark Brent also jumped more than 14% for the session.\n\nThe sharp moves came after a series of drone attacks hit the world's largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia over the weekend, forcing the Kingdom to cut its oil output in half \u2014 which is about 5% of global oil output. The attack was claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels and the Trump administration has blamed Iran. A Saudi-led military coalition said Monday the attack was carried out by \"Iranian weapons\" and did not originate from Yemen.\n\nThe Kingdom's national oil company, Saudi Aramco, reportedly aimed to restore about a third of its crude output, or 2 million barrel by Monday. But media reports suggest it could take weeks before Aramco restores the majority of its output at the affected production site.\n\nSaudi Arabia's \"spare capacity and existing stockpiles (~26 days of export) should mitigate some of the lost output,\" Vivek Dhar, director of mining and energy commodities research at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a morning note.", "description": "West Texas Intermediate futures as well as international benchmark Brent both gained more than 14% in the overnight session.", "authors": ["Saheli Roy Choudhury"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105646667-1545784238262gettyimages-97748966.jpeg?v=1568679090", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
