The pathbreaking Amazon original series has been battered by scandal and missteps, and its movie-length finale ditches its onetime star and morphs from mumblecore dramedy to an entirely more bombastic genre. But Transparent\u2019s essence remains intact: It\u2019s about saying the unsayable and trying to be whole in the aftermath. When the well-off professor and granddad Mort came out as the trans woman Maura, she broke with a lifetime of shame and with centuries of taboo. Maura\u2019s children felt spurred to rethink their own sexualities, genders, relationships, and worldviews. Everything solid in the show has been under review. Yet family stays family.\n\nIn real life, the show\u2019s credibility has been under review, too. Jeffrey Tambor\u2019s portrayal of Maura earned wild accolades as he spoke out for LGBTQ causes. Behind the scenes, though, he allegedly belittled and harassed trans colleagues, according to his former assistant Van Barnes and the actor Trace Lysette. He denied the allegations and was dropped from the show, but the way that the showrunner Jill Soloway (who is gender-nonconforming) spoke of the situation made it seem as though they cared more about optics than about justice. Their 2018 memoir is arguably best known for a viral pan of it by Andrea Long Chu, who suggested that Soloway sees \u201ctrans people as creative oil to be fracked.\u201d\n\nAny other show faced with a scandal so existentially troubling\u2014suspicion that its overtly political essence masked hypocrisy\u2014might have just called it quits then. But Transparent has always been about surviving cataclysms and leaning into change. \u201cMusicale Finale\u201d makes a bighearted attempt along those lines, if not an entirely successful one. Songs written by Soloway\u2019s sister Faith pleasantly sing-rather-than-show a series of final transformations for the characters. The lyrics get so hyperbolic as to seem trolling, but there\u2019s just not much drama. Fine actors who once expressed complex emotions in charmingly messy cross talk now spend too much time shouting out slogans as if they were Elsa of Arendelle.\n\nThe ideas powering the show remain interesting, though, and one of the biggest ideas is about Judaism. Maura dies offscreen very early in the episode, and for the rest of the hour and a half, her loved ones\u2014her ex-wife, Shelly; her kids, Ari, Sarah, and Josh (Gaby Hoffmann, Amy Landecker, Jay Duplass); and her friend Davina (Alexandra Billings)\u2014move through their faith\u2019s mourning rituals. Each stage is complicated, however, by this family\u2019s unconventional demands. Maura, it turns out, asked to be cremated, violating Jewish customs. Ari, once named Ali, wants to perform the funeral service and dreams of becoming a rabbi, but will need a pan-gender bart mitzvah first. As the Pfeffermans sit shiva, they encounter exes who, at various points in the series, suffered from the main characters\u2019 selfishness.", "description": "The Amazon show\u2019s finale uses bombastic songs to convey its once-subtle message of hope.", "authors": ["Spencer Kornhaber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/transparent_musicale_finale_TRANSPARENT_KEY_ART_TEXTLESS_rgb/facebook.jpg?1569470227", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
