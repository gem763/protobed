Morgan analysts reminded investors in a market note, pointing out that Johnson, a staunch Brexiteer, leads opinion polls.\n\nNevertheless, the fact that a hard Brexit has, for now, been removed as an immediate risk gave markets some cheer, as did Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam's move to withdraw the bill that triggered months of violent protests in the city. there is no 'all clear' on market concerns, investor sentiment pulled back from extremes...the deferral of a no-deal Brexit, soothed nerves,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at brokerage CMC Markets in Sydney.", "description": "FOREX-Trade talk plans cheer risk currencies, hit safe-haven yen", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEAA20GT_L.jpg"}
