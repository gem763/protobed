(Sorry, little Johnny, a backyard circus with pony rides isn\u2019t in the budget this year!) But it\u2019s possible that we\u2019re projecting our own insecurities onto our kids. Just because seven of Johnny\u2019s classmates have had birthday parties at the local trampoline park \u2014 that\u2019s the big deal in my area, anyway \u2014 doesn\u2019t mean his birthday will be ruined if you decide you\u2019d rather tone down the spending a bit.\n\nWhile we're still in the colder months, however, affordable outdoor options can start to feel limited. Parks get cold and windy. Backyard sprinkler and Slip \u2018n Slide parties are a hit in the summer; in the cooler months, not so much.\n\nSo one parent with a couple of spring birthday parties on the horizon took to Reddit for advice on low-key, affordable indoor party ideas. The original post has since been deleted, but the very good responses remain archived for the benefit of the rest of us.\n\nDon\u2019t pay for the birthday party package\n\nThe idea is so simple, it might not occur to us if not for Reddit user u/MrsLeeCorso:\n\n[Big dinner] parties can be pricey, but meeting a few friends there, giving them each a play pass and buying a pizza is cheaper than the group party. You [might not be able to] bring a cake or get the decorations but you can sing \u201chappy birthday\u201d with a pizza.\n\nThe same goes for that trampoline park, the theatre, the bowling alley or laser tag. It\u2019s a party if you say it is, not just if you buy the platinum birthday package complete with themed decorations and two staff helpers. (And it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask before you go \u2014 some places are happy to look the other way as you haul in your cupcakes.)\n\nHost a sleepover\n\nWant to be a hero? Cancel the \u201cparty\u201d with the whole class and invite a few close friends over for a sleepover. You are not likely to get much (any) sleep, so don\u2019t make any plans the next day, but a homemade cake, some pizza and a few bags of chips is all they need to make epic memories. They\u2019ll play video games and drink stupid amounts of soft drink and it will barely cost you anything.\n\nTry a craft party\n\nReddit user u/liottleredhen42 suggested this theme, which can be fun and unique and offer a built-in party favour:\n\nOne year my mum bought T-shirts and puff paint for all my friends, and we made our own T-shirts. Slime parties are also really popular in my area right now, and the supplies for that are pretty cheap.\n\nIndoor pool party\n\nDoes your local community centre or YMCA have an indoor pool? Invite 4-5 friends for an indoor pool party and be a winter birthday party king/queen. They may also have a gathering area or community room you could use for pizza or cake after they\u2019ve worked up an appetite.\n\nKids are often easier to please than we might expect. Some food, friends and the opportunity for fun is usually all they need to make an ordinary day feel special.", "description": "It can seem like kids\u2019 expectations around birthday parties are getting out of hand.
