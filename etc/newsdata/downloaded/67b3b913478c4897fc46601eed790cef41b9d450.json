REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nWith growth barely holding in positive territory and the outlook darkening, it was hardly the grand finale hoped for by Draghi, whose 2012 promise to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro \u2014 code for rescuing heavily indebted countries \u2014 is credited with saving the shared currency from collapse.\n\nWith inflation languishing at less than half the ECB\u2019s target and little hope for a speedy rebound, Draghi even kept the door open to more stimulus, days before he hands the reins to new ECB chief Christine Lagarde.\n\nDespite weak growth across the euro zone, Draghi insisted the benefits of loose money policy far outweighed the risks and rejected the suggestion that a public split with policy hawks in the bank had tainted his legacy.\n\n\u201cI feel like someone who tried to comply with the mandate in the best possible way,\u201d Draghi, whose term has passed without a single interest rate hike, told a news conference.\n\n\u201cThese disagreements are often made public and often they are not, so ... I have taken this as part and parcel of the ongoing debate and discussions.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging that the bank was keeping a close watch out for any unintended consequences of ultra-low and negative interest rates, he added that they had clearly stimulated the economy through higher lending and helped boost employment.\n\n\u201cFor us it has been a very positive experience,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked what advice he had for former International Monetary Fund chief Lagarde, who attended but did not participate in Thursday\u2019s meeting, he replied: \u201cNo advice needed\u201d.\n\nHAWKS CIRCLE\n\nThe spat with rebels on the ECB governing council has taken the shine off an otherwise remarkable reign in which Draghi led the ECB in an unprecedented experiment with unconventional monetary policy that helped avert deflation and stopped a debt crisis from spiraling out of control.\n\nMuch of Thursday\u2019s focus was on his decision to push through the open-ended bond-buying scheme that will tie his successor\u2019s hands for years to come, despite opposition from a third of policymakers.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s meeting, the ECB kept its benchmark deposit rate unchanged at minus 0.5%. It also reaffirmed that its open bond purchases will start in November, at a rate of 20 billion euros per month and will run \u201cas long as necessary\u201d.\n\nExpecting no change, financial markets were calm after the decision, with the euro EUR= little changed against the dollar at 1.1123 and German 10-year yields DE10YT=RR at -0.382%.\n\nTurmoil within the ECB is likely to persist and Lagarde will have to deal with objections that Draghi\u2019s policy of sub-zero deposit rates and massive bond purchases are hurting savers, squeezing banks and pension funds and inflating financial bubbles, while doing little for inflation.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just a few prominent hawks \u2014 including the central bank governors of Germany, the Netherlands and Austria \u2014 who question the wisdom of resuming the bond-buying program.\n\nFrance\u2019s representatives on the Governing Council also joined the chorus and 95% of respondents in a Reuters poll said the stimulus package would not significantly help in bringing inflation back to the ECB\u2019s target of just under 2%.\n\nLAGARDE REVIEW\n\nDraghi played down the dissent, pointing out that all moves made in September were backed by majorities and were once again confirmed by the outcome of this month\u2019s meeting. But the split has left an imprint on ECB-watchers.\n\n\u201cDissent within the Governing Council against the latest package cannot be ignored, especially since it is no longer coming exclusively from the same core countries,\u201d Gilles Moec, chief economist of French insurer Axa Group, said.\n\nSeeking to buy time, Lagarde has promised a review of the bank\u2019s \u201cmonetary framework\u201d, likely to mean its policy goals and tools, similar to a review now being conducted by the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nThe problem for the ECB is that some of the major factors depressing prices are outside its control.\n\nThese range from demographic and technological changes to the euro zone\u2019s reliance on exports, in particular by German manufacturers, which leaves it bearing the brunt of a global trade war.\n\nWith the ECB\u2019s firepower now largely spent, Draghi and his successor are likely to continue urging governments that are running a surplus, such as Germany and the Netherlands, to invest more to generate economic growth at home.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nBut latest budget figures, showing only a modest expansion, suggest their calls are likely to be frustrated for now.\n\n\u201cWe think ECB monetary policy will be on autopilot for a while,\u201d BNP Paribas said. \u201cWe think it will maintain its current hyper-accommodative stance well beyond 2020 and that the threshold for further easing is rather high.\u201d\n\n(This story adds dropped word in headline)", "description": "European Central Bank President Mario Draghi defended his ultra-easy monetary policy stance on Thursday as his eight-year tenure at the bank closes in exactly the same place he started: trying to prop up a perpetually ailing currency bloc.", "authors": ["Francesco Canepa", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444492631&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N12M", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
