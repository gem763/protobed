To Bezezuh, it was a testament to Fonge. When the 27-year-old home health aide first started working with the 24-year-old with autism, he was mostly nonverbal, Bezezuh says. But the two practiced pronouncing phrases such as, \u201cGood morning\u201d and \u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d and Fonge took Miler with him to friends\u2019 birthday parties and baby showers to socialize.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEverybody in the family, everyone knew Devon,\u201d Bezezuh says. \u201cHe treated his client as a blood brother. They would eat off the same plate.\u201d\n\nWhen they got to Miler\u2019s rowhouse that day, Fonge told his cousin he just needed to walk Miler inside. He asked him to wait in the car.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back in three minutes,\u201d Bezezuh recalls him saying.\n\nBezezuh says he was still waiting when a vehicle pulled in front of his. He saw two men dressed in black step out, walk toward the house and, when the front door opened, go inside. A short while later, he says, he noticed a woman who was walking her dog start running.\n\nHe lowered his window and that\u2019s when he heard the last gunshot.\n\nAD\n\nWhen he finally walked inside the rowhouse, he saw what D.C. police would later describe: Fonge and Miler had both been fatally shot.\n\nAD\n\nPolice later arrested Davon Peyton, 27, of Alexandria and charged him with first-degree murder while armed. According to witness statements in an arrest warrant, Peyton and his brother went to the house on Oct. 9 so the latter could pay back money he owed for candy sold at the house. Peyton asked to use the restroom and was directed upstairs. A short while later, according to the witness statements, Peyton came downstairs, brandished a black handgun and demanded money.\n\n\u201cGive up whatever you got,\u201d one person heard him say.\n\nAD\n\nOne of the witnesses who spoke to police was Peyton\u2019s brother. He told them that when Peyton pointed the gun at Miler, he tried to stop him from shooting the man. He told police that he stood in front of Miler but that Peyton reached around him, fired the gun and pushed him out of way. The brother said Peyton then walked toward the back of the house, pointed the gun at Fonge and, after saying, \u201cGive it up,\u201d pulled the trigger again.\n\nAD\n\nWhen police arrived, according to the warrant, they found both men unconscious, with \u201cno signs consistent with life.\u201d Miler had been shot in the neck and Fonge had a gunshot wound to the face.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want to believe that he\u2019s gone,\u201d Bezezuh says on a recent afternoon of his cousin, who was also called Leke. \u201cI keep saying every day, \u2018Leke, come on, let\u2019s go, I\u2019m still waiting for you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhen Bezezuh, 30, came to the area from Cameroon about a year and a half ago, Fonge was the one who made sure he felt welcomed. He pulled him into his social circles and helped him get a job as a home health aide. Fonge had come from the same southwest region of the country years earlier with an aunt and uncle who adopted him.\n\nBezezuh says his cousin\u2019s death has not only hit his family hard, but it has also been felt by Cameroonians throughout the Washington region, across the United States and much farther.\n\nAD\n\nThe family expects that hundreds of people will show up at a service they are planning for him in the D.C. area. They also know many people are waiting for his body to be sent to Cameroon, where his mother and younger brother remain.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHis mother told me that since last week people keep coming to the home,\u201d says Alfred Forgwe, who adopted Fonge when he was a teenager. There, he explains, it is customary for people to stay with grieving families for days. \u201cPeople are sleeping everywhere. Some are sleeping on the floor of the living room. The house is full. It\u2019s going to keep on like that until he is finally buried.\u201d\n\nThe family is trying to raise $25,000 through a GoFundMe to send his body home. By Friday afternoon, the fund had been shared more than 1,200 times and had raised more than $15,000.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Forgwe says. \u201cI appreciate everyone.\u201d\n\nHe describes Fonge as \u201cdifferent\u201d from most people. He says Fonge rarely got angry with anyone, and if someone got upset with him, he always found a way to make that person laugh. He recalls watching him build a relationship with Miler. He saw them cook together and take naps on the couch at the same time. He says Fonge also had a way of connecting with children, including Forgwe\u2019s 8-year-old daughter.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe keeps asking me, \u2018Why would someone shoot him to death? What did he do?\u2019 \u201d Forgwe says. \u201cNo matter what I explain, she keeps asking me.\u201d\n\nHe also works as a home health aide and says the days since Fonge\u2019s death have been difficult.\n\n\u201cSometimes I cry at work,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m eating and I think of him and cry. It will take me a long time to stop crying.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFonge\u2019s roommate, Paul Anida, says he woke up a few nights ago from a panic attack. He says Fonge had an \u201celectric, vibrant personality\u201d that drew people toward him. Now, Anida says, their apartment \u201cfeels like a graveyard.\u201d\n\nHe also came from Cameroon and says that for many people in the community, Fonge\u2019s death has brought close what they thought they left far behind: \u201cYou come here and expect to have peace of mind. You come here and you expect to stay away from all the troubles back home.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA Human Rights Watch report describes violence and human rights abuses taking place in the country in recent years: \u201cIn the South West and North West, government security forces have committed extrajudicial executions, burned property, carried out arbitrary arrests, and tortured detainees. . . . According to the International Crisis Group, government forces and armed separatists killed over 420 civilians in the regions since the crisis escalated in 2017.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnida says Fonge moved his mother from one place to another to keep her safe from the violence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming worse,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t value human life.\u201d\n\nThey don\u2019t value human life. He is talking about there. But he could also be talking about here. Students in the District have said they are scared to walk to and from school because of the gun violence, and a climbing homicide count recently pushed city officials to authorize paying officers overtime to patrol three areas of the city.\n\nAD\n\nWithin a 24-hour period this month, bullets killed a 15-year-old boy, a D.C. Housing Authority employee on his lunch break and, in that rowhouse, two men who spent their days sharing food and practicing saying words such as \u201cGood night.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe loved his job,\u201d Bezezuh says. \u201cHe enjoyed every minute of doing his job.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFor it, he says, his cousin earned about $15 an hour, which he generously shared with friends who needed it and relatives back in his home country.\n\nBefore the Wednesday he was killed, he told several friends that he planned to send his mother money that Friday.\n\nNow, they\u2019re hoping to at least send her his body.", "description": "The home health aide, known to many as \u201cLeke,\u201d was near the end of his shift that day.", "authors": ["Theresa Vargas", "Local Columnist Who Previously Wrote For The Local Enterprise Team About Poverty", "Race", "People With Disabilities."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RXsApLNOFGC6IDIFbIozBgx5GZw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CXLC3FHRCEI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
