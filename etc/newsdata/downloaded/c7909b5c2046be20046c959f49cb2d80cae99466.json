More impressively, it reported GAAP earnings of $1.47 per share, compared to analyst estimates of $1.05 per share.\n\nSubscriber growth, meanwhile, was a mixed bag. Netflix reported 500,000 paid net additions in the United States, falling far short of its forecast of 800,000. Conversely, international growth exceeded expectations, with 6.3 million net adds compared to a forecast of 6.2 million.\n\nU.S. subscriber growth looks particularly weak when you compare it to 2018 \u2014 Netflix has only seen 2.1 million net additions domestically in the first nine months of 2019, compared to 4.1 million in the same period of 2018. Netflix\u2019s investor letter seems to blame this on price hikes earlier this year.\n\n\u201cSince our US price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower US membership growth,\u201d the company says. \u201cOn a member base of more than 60m, very small movements in churn can have a meaningful impact on paid net adds.\u201d\n\nThe company also noted that its average revenue per user is up 16.5% year-over-year in the U.S. (I assume it can thank those same price hikes.)\n\nOverall, Netflix said it now has more than 158 million members. It\u2019s projecting 26.7 million net adds for the entirety of 2019, down from 28.6 million net adds last year.\n\n\u201cWhile we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year over year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition,\u201d Netflix says.\n\nNetflix\u2019s stock is up 7.6% in after-hours trading (as of 4:39pm Eastern).\n\nHowever, those subscriber numbers are certainly going to provide more fuel for skeptics. For example, eMarketer analyst Eric Haggstrom said in a statement that \u201cthe fact that Netflix has shown disappointing growth without the new competition present, is a negative omen for Netflix in 2020 and beyond.\u201d\n\nThe investor letter includes an extended discussion of that competition, acknowledging the upcoming launch of Disney+ and Apple+ next month, and HBO Max and Peacock next year.\n\n\u201cMany are focused on the \u2018streaming wars,\u2019 but we\u2019ve been competing with streamers (Amazon, YouTube, Hulu) as well as linear TV for over a decade,\u201d the letter says.\n\nIt goes on to acknowledge that these upcoming launches will be \u201cnoisy\u201d and could create \u201csome modest headwind in our near-term growth,\u201d but it argues that there are still opportunities for long-term growth.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment,\u201d Netflix says. \u201cJust like the evolution from broadcast TV to cable, these once-in-a-generation changes are very large and open up big, new opportunities for many players. For example, for the first few decades of cable, networks like TBS, USA, ESPN, MTV and Discovery didn\u2019t take much audience share from each other, but instead, they collectively took audience share from broadcast viewing.\u201d\n\nThe letter also continues Netflix\u2019s practice of release select viewership numbers about new programs. (Obligatory caveat: These shouldn\u2019t be compared directly to third-party numbers like Nielsen ratings.)\n\nFor example, it says the third season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d is its most-watched season to-date, viewed by 64 million member households in its first four weeks of release, while \u201cUnbelievable\u201d was watched by 32 million households. On the movie side, \u201cTall Girl\u201d was watched by 41 million households.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to have the quality of our slate rival the ambition of its scope,\u201d Netflix says. \u201cAn example is \u200b\u2019Orange Is the New Black\u200b,\u2019 which wrapped its final new season in Q3. The show was celebrated by fans and the media for the groundbreaking role it played for Netflix and the culture at large; Time Magazine said \u201c\u2026\u2019Orange Is the New Black\u2019 is the most important TV show of the decade.\u201d\u200b", "description": "Netflix\u2019s Q3 financial report has given the company\u2019s stock a boost in after-hours trading, with profits significantly exceeding analyst expectations.
