Beating Iowa", "language": "en", "text": "AMES, Iowa (AP) - Coach Matt Campbell has done just about everything Iowa State could have hoped for in his three-plus seasons in charge - except beat Iowa.\n\nCampbell is 0-3 against the 19th-ranked Hawkeyes (2-0, 1-0 Big Ten), including a 42-3 whipping in 2016 that remains the biggest loss that Campbell has ever suffered with the Cyclones. Iowa State improved enough by 2017 to take Iowa to overtime before losing by 3, and the Cyclones could only muster up 3 points in a 10-point loss a year ago. The sked against their in-state rival stands at four games.\n\nThe Hawkeyes look like the better team heading into Saturday\u2019s game, thumping their first two opponents by an average of 27 points. Iowa State (1-0) needed three overtimes to get past Northern Iowa two weeks ago before falling out of the Top 25.\n\n\u201cThey know who they are,\u201d Campbell said about Iowa. \u201cThey\u2019re not trying to be somebody else. And the reality is, when you know that and you become that, then you know your answers to some of the challenges that maybe come within a game and certainly from season to season.\u201d\n\nSTANLEY THE MAN-LEY\n\nIowa senior quarterback Nate Stanley is off to a blazing start, throwing for 488 yards and six touchdowns without a pick through two games. Stanley, who cemented his status as the Hawkeyes\u2019 starter with a five-touchdown effort in a 44-41 win in Ames in 2017, has 58 career TD passes against just 16 picks. He is now just four scoring tosses away from passing another three-year starter, Drew Tate, for second on Iowa\u2019s all-time list.\n\n\u201cMy emphasis to him, or my encouragement, would just be to enjoy his senior year. Relax a little bit and enjoy it,\u201d Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said. \u201cHe\u2019s really looked like he\u2019s been in control and command out there, better than at any point in his career.\u201d\n\nWHO WILL IT BE AT RB?\n\nIowa State still has five players listed on its depth chart at running back, and Johnnie Lang, Sheldon Croney and freshman Breece Hall all got at least 10 carries against Northern Iowa. Asked who impressed him the most against the Panthers, Campbell simply answered \u201ctied.\u201d The competition could stretch beyond Saturday\u2019s game, though a big game by any of them would help clear things up.\n\n\u201cI know that\u2019s been a hot ticket item, everybody\u2019s been asking that question for the last month,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll take a while for us to figure out exactly who we are.\u201d\n\nIOWA\u2019S DEFENSE\n\nIowa State, which scored just 13 points in regulation in its opener, will be facing one of the best defenses it will see this season. The Hawkeyes are tied for fifth nationally at just seven points a game allowed and are ranked ninth in the country in passing yards allowed (116.5).\n\n\u201cWe were just pressing too much,\u201d quarterback Brock Purdy said about Iowa State\u2019s opener. \u201cWe have to learn to be patient.\u201d\n\nEXTRA POINTS\n\nIowa has averaged 30 points a game in Stanley\u2019s 28 starts. \u2026 Iowa State has only beaten a ranked Iowa team once. That came in 2005, when the Cyclones rolled past the Hawkeyes 23-3. \u2026 Iowa has won its last three games in Ames. \u2026 Campbell is 19-11 in his last 30 games with the Cyclones.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\u201cUntil you\u2019ve been through one, you really can\u2019t appreciate it, I don\u2019t think. But the guys that have been through it get it.\u201d Ferentz said about playing the rival Cyclones.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Coach Matt Campbell has done just about everything Iowa State could have hoped for in his three-plus seasons in charge - except beat Iowa.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Luke Meredith"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/rutgers_iowa_football_68280_c0-320-2767-1933_s1770x1032.jpg?d8f139016e50a7ee77f6c6c64dc9ec0e40a88030", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
