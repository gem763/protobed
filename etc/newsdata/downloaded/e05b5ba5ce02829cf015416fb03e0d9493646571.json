The expenses were attributed to the EJCR, LLC Dba Advanced Aviation Team, recent Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show.\n\nWhile Biden leads the pack, he is not alone in his exorbitant private air travel expenditures. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) reportedly spent just short of $500,000 \u2013 $479,000 \u2013 on private air travel. That is a $179,000 increase from his private air travel expenses in the previous quarter, according to the Hill.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) also put her climate change-related concerns aside, spending $253,000\u2013 $236,000 more than the $17,000 she spent in the previous three months.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \u2013 who once described climate change as the \u201cgreatest threat to our national security\u201d \u2013 spent $360,000 on private air travel in the third quarter. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) \u2013 who described climate change as an \u201cexistential crisis that threatens all of us\u201d \u2013 also utilized private air travel, spending $132,000 in the third quarter. However, a campaign aide told the Hill that Warren makes an effort to offset her carbon output and gave $10,150 to Native Energy in the third quarter.\n\nAn outline of the Democrat-backed Green New Deal, released this year, lamented the existence of cows and air travel but admitted that neither could be totally eliminated.\n\nThe outline stated:\n\nWe set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren\u2019t sure that we\u2019ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.\n\nThe excessive air travel of the candidates calls their authenticity into question.\n\nWarren has called climate change an \u201cexistential crisis that threatens all of us\u201d and called for \u201cbold action now to stop it before it\u2019s too late\u201d:\n\nClimate change is an existential crisis that threatens all of us\u2014and we need to take bold action now to stop it before it's too late. That's why we need to have a #ClimateDebate. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) August 24, 2019\n\nBiden \u2013 who spent nearly $1 million on private jet usage in a three-month span \u2013 warned that it is going to take \u201cleadership\u201d to combat the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d:\n\nIt\u2019s critical to have a plan to combat climate change, but it\u2019s going to take more than plans \u2014 it\u2019s going to take leadership. I have the experience and relationships necessary to rally the world to meet the urgency of this climate crisis. #ClimateTownHall pic.twitter.com/aXvhwUDHMq \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 5, 2019\n\nHarris has called climate change an \u201cimminent threat to our planet,\u201d while Buttigieg warned that the threat \u201cisn\u2019t theoretical\u201d:\n\nClimate change is an imminent threat to our planet unless we correct course. It\u2019s within our power to do so. Now is the time. pic.twitter.com/q1mToVv6GE \u2014 Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) February 18, 2019\n\nClimate change isn't theoretical. Parts of California are on fire, in Florida they're talking about sea level rise. In South Bend I had to activate the emergency operation center twice in two years: the first time was a 1000-year flood, the next was a 500-year flood. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/xx7SFoImuv \u2014 Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) June 28, 2019\n\nSanders, who unveiled a $16 trillion climate change proposal in August, called President Trump an \u201cidiot\u201d for not taking climate change seriously:\n\nDonald Trump believes climate change is a hoax. Donald Trump is an idiot. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) August 10, 2019\n\nNevertheless, critics argue that Democrats are demonstrating that they are not taking the matter seriously, as their actions do not always coincide with their rhetoric.\n\nFor instance, Democrats came under fire last month after attending the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, which featured thousands of steaks. While climate change alarmists argue that red meat consumption is contributing to the \u201ccrisis,\u201d several Democrat candidates happily assisted in grilling the juicy cuts of meat, despite some of the presidential hopefuls previously floating limiting beef consumption in order to curb the looming threat:\n\nLook at what the anti-meat party is doing to the planet at the Iowa Steak Fry. pic.twitter.com/YNHKRYcugv \u2014 Marc Lotter (@marc_lotter) September 21, 2019\n\n.\u2066@PeteButtigieg\u2069 takes the stage at the #SteakFry!
