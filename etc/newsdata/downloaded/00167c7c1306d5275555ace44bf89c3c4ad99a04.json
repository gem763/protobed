But it will have the same effect.\n\nNow that the transcript has been released, it\u2019s The New York Times that doesn't want anyone to see it.\n\nThe transcript I'd like to see is the one of Nancy Pelosi reading the Trump transcript.\n\nF@@@@@@CK! Whose f***ing idea was it to demand this goddamn transcript?\n\nF@CK!\n\nF@@CK!\n\nF@@@CK!\n\nThe absolute worst version for Trump -- i.e. the one being repeated non-stop on MSNBC -- is that he did exactly what Obama and Biden were doing to Ukraine: intimidating an ally into giving us something in exchange for the foreign aid we were giving them.\n\nBiden himself bragged about getting Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold a big fat check from them.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 argument is: No, no, no! When WE were pressuring Ukraine, we were doing it for good! Don\u2019t you understand? We\u2019re good; they\u2019re bad.\n\nThe other reason the media are going to have to bury this transcript is that Trump brought up a few items that the media have been hoping the public would never find out about.\n\nTrump said: \u201cThere's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nWell, that\u2019s something the media haven't mentioned before. Ninety-nine percent of Americans will be hearing about the funny business with Biden's son, Hunter, for the first time with the release of this transcript.\n\nWhy did Vice President Biden order the Ukrainian president to fire the prosecutor investigating the Ukrainian company paying his son millions of dollars? Are Democrats claiming that this company was clean as a whistle and it was an absolute OUTRAGE that it was being investigated?\n\nUkraine was looking into the company that conveniently placed Hunter Biden on its board long before Trump came on the scene. Something must have made the Ukrainian prosecutor want to investigate Biden\u2019s company -- and it sure wasn\u2019t to curry favor with the Obama/Biden administration.\n\nThe second issue the media does not want anyone to think about is CrowdStrike.\n\nWhat is CrowdStrike, you ask? That is the cybersecurity firm that is the sole source of the claim that the Russians hacked the DNC\u2019s emails -- which launched the conspiracy theories that tied our country in knots for the past three years.\n\nThe Russian collusion story was originally hatched by Hillary Clinton in the summer of 2016 to cover up the utter corruption revealed by the dump of Democratic National Committee emails on Wikileaks. As was her practice whenever a scandal threatened to engulf her, Hillary rushed out and told the press to investigate something else.\n\nAnd \u201cthe great story\u201d about the DNC email hack wasn\u2019t about a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d -- as she claimed when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke. No, this time, it was a vast Russian conspiracy!\n\nAt the time, the entire media laughed at Hillary\u2019s Russian conspiracy nonsense -- The New York Times, New York Newsday, the Los Angeles Times and so on. But then Trump won the election, and suddenly the Russia conspiracy seemed totally believable. What else could explain how Americans could put this boob in the White House?\n\nThe subsequent three years of breathless Russia coverage was based entirely on the word of one cybersecurity firm, CrowdStrike, that the DNC's emails had been hacked by Russia.\n\nRecall that the DNC wouldn\u2019t allow the FBI or any other U.S. government official anywhere near its computers. That\u2019s precisely why so many cybersecurity experts doubted that it was the Russians: The FBI was never allowed to perform its own investigation.\n\nCrowdStrike was founded by Ukrainian Dmitri Alperovitch (now an American citizen apparently -- because who isn't?) and funded by the fanatically anti-Russian Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk Foundation.\n\nTalk about interfering with our democracy! Alperovitch and Pinchuk sent one political party and nine-tenths of the American media off on a wild goose chase into Russian collusion that, after years of accusations, investigations and embarrassing conspiracy-mongering ... turned up goose eggs.\n\nThe entire Russian insanity was launched by a couple of Ukrainians. I think a lot of us would like to get to the bottom of that.\n\nThis is why Trump said to President Zelensky: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike ... I guess you have one of your wealthy people ... The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\n(How'd you like to be the Ukrainian translator for a Trump conversation?)\n\nTrump has been justly criticized for hiring his daughter and son-in-law at the White House. But at least when he pressures a foreign leader for a favor, it\u2019s to investigate corruption, not to get a prosecutor off his son\u2019s back. Maybe Biden's son was guilty, maybe he was innocent. But it is a fact that Joe Biden held up foreign aid to a desperately needy ally in exchange for their halting prosecution that implicated his son. It's not Trump's fault that Biden is now running for president.\n\nI'll give the Democrats this: They've gotten so good at trying to remove Trump from office that, instead of three years, their insane accusations blow up in their faces within a week.", "description": "Editor's note: The following column contains graphic language.The transcript of .09/25/2019 19:26:33PM EST.", "authors": ["Ann Coulter", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2014/289/17329344-1af8-4a1f-8631-ab65d20076a0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
