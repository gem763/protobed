Dr. Russell\u2019s new book, Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control, argues that unless we re-think the building blocks of AI, the arrival of superhuman AI may become the \u201clast event in human history.\u201d\n\nThat may sound a bit wild-eyed, but Human Compatible is a carefully written explanation of the concepts underlying AI as well as the history of their development. If you want to understand how fast AI is developing and why the technology is so dangerous, Human Compatible is your guide, literally starting with Aristotle and closing with OpenAI Five\u2019s Dota 2 triumph.\n\nStuart\u2019s aim is help non-technologists grasp why AI systems must be designed not simply to fulfill \u201cobjectives\u201d assigned to them, the so-called \u201cStandard Model\u201d in AI development today, but to operate so \u201cthat machines will necessarily defer to humans: they will ask permission, they will accept correction, and they will allow themselves to be switched off.\u201d", "description": "Dr. Stuart Russell, a distinguished AI researcher and computer scientist at UC Berkeley, believes there is a fundamental and potentially civilization-ending shortcoming in the \u201cstandard model\u201d of AI, which is taught (and Dr. Russell wrote the main textbook) and applied virtually everywhere.
