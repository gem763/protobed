AB 175 also violates the free speech rights of foster parents by compelling them to use a foster child\u2019s pronoun of preference.\n\n\u201cFoster parents care deeply about their children, and desperately want to protect them from abuse. But how can they do this if the state keeps them in the dark, even if in cases of rape?\u201d asked California Family Council President Jonathan Keller. \u201cIt seems Governor Newsom expects these brave foster parents to merely provide room and board while kids run their own lives. No good mom or dad would neglect their kids this way.\u201d\n\nIn case you think these claims are exaggerated, here is the actual text from AB 175 explaining these foster child rights:\n\n\u201cAt any age, to consent to or decline services regarding contraception, pregnancy care, and perinatal care, including, but not limited to, abortion services and health care services for sexual assault without the knowledge or consent of any adult.\u201d\n\n\n\nand health care without the knowledge or consent of any adult.\u201d \u201cTo make, send, and receive confidential telephone calls and other electronic communications , and to send and receive unopened mail, unless prohibited by court order.\u201d\n\n\n\nand other , and to send and receive unopened mail, unless prohibited by court order.\u201d \u201cTo be placed in out-of-home care according to their gender identity, regardless of the gender or sex listed in their court, child welfare, medical, or vital records, to be referred to by the child\u2019s preferred name and gender pronoun, and to maintain privacy regarding sexual orientation and gender identity and expression, unless the child permits the information to be disclosed, or disclosure is required to protect their health and safety, or disclosure is compelled by law or a court order.\u201d\n\n\n\nRegarding the issue of compelled the use of preferred pronouns, CFC\u2019s Director of Capitol Engagement Greg Burt responded saying, \u201cThe First Amendment not only protects our freedom to speak words the government doesn\u2019t like, but also prohibits the government from compelling us to say words or promote ideas we don\u2019t believe.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Greg Burt", "Joshua Denton", "California Family Council"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/californiafamily.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gavin-with-kids.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
