It\u2019s a welcome change.\n\nNot long ago, Tolerance 2.0 was in full swing. For the uninitiated, Tolerance 1.0 allowed for \u201cthe existence of opinions \u2026 that one dislikes or disagrees with.\u201d In contrast, Tolerance 2.0 seeks the homogenization of belief and expression, particularly as it relates to the government-approved orthodoxy regarding marriage and human sexuality.\n\nThose who dissented by stubbornly clinging to their sincerely-held beliefs were to be punished. They were to be rebuked, reeducated, and (if successful) reintroduced to society as reformed. Alternatively, they were to be removed from polite society and the public square.\n\nThe examples are numerous, but include:\n\n-Jack Phillips, the cake artist in Colorado\n\n-Barronelle Stutzman, the florist in Washington\n\n-Blaine Adamson, the promotional printer in Kentucky\n\n-Carl and Angel Larsen, the filmmakers in Minnesota\n\n-Joanna and Breanna, the artists in Arizona\n\nOne by one, these men and women were forced to plead their cases before human rights commissions, as well as state and federal courts. They faced the possibility of fines, the loss of personal assets, or even prison. Some received death threats or were compared to Nazis. All were told some variation of this message: compromising your religious beliefs is \u201cthe price of citizenship.\u201d\n\nBut then Jack Phillips stood before the U.S. Supreme Court, and Justice Kennedy proclaimed that \u201ctolerance is essential in a free society.\u201d I wrote at the time that Masterpiece Cakeshop would require that the justices \u201cgrapple with the question of what tolerance demands in a free society.\u201d The Court answered, in part, ruling that \u201cthe state in its position here has been neither tolerant nor respectful of Mr. Phillips\u2019 religious beliefs\u201d and condemning the commission for \u201cimplying that religious beliefs and persons are less than fully welcome in Colorado\u2019s business community.\u201d\n\nMany wondered what might come next. Would lower courts protect the constitutional freedoms of all Americans, or simply require future infringement on those freedoms to be undertaken with more respect (that is, with less overt hostility)?\n\nWe are starting to see the answer.\n\nJust weeks ago on August 23, Blaine Adamson stood before the Kentucky Supreme Court and asked it to rule that Americans need not surrender their First Amendment rights of expression and belief when they enter the public square. Two lower courts in the state have already ruled in favor of Blaine and his company, Hands On Originals. It\u2019s very possible the Kentucky Supreme Court will uphold those decisions.\n\nOn that same day, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Carl and Angel Larsen, holding that \u201cthe First Amendment allows the Larsens to choose when to speak and what to say.\u201d The Larsens seek to make films about God\u2019s design for marriage as a lifelong union of one man and one woman, but a state law demands that if the Larsens produce such films, they must also create films celebrating same-sex marriage. The court\u2019s ruling instructs the trial court to reconsider whether the Larsens are entitled to a preliminary injunction preventing enforcement of the law.\n\nMonday\u2019s ruling in Arizona gives defenders of freedom additional cause to rejoice. It recognizes that, while Christian professionals like Joanna and Breanna happily serve all people, they are unable to express messages that conflict with their faith. The Court held:\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs must, and they do, serve all customers regardless of their sexual orientation. \u2026 But no law, including a public accommodations law, is immune from the protections of free speech and free exercise. \u2026 The enduring strength of the First Amendment is that it allows people to speak their minds and express their beliefs without government interference. But here, the City effectively cuts off Plaintiffs\u2019 right to express their beliefs about same\u2013sex marriage by telling them what they can and cannot say.\u201d\n\nTime will tell if this trend continues. Barronelle Stutzman loves her longtime customer and friend Rob Ingersoll, but she was sued when she respectfully declined his invitation to help celebrate his same-sex ceremony, and now faces the loss of everything she owns. She may be headed back to the U.S. Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Jack Phillips remains embroiled in the latest attack on his faith and livelihood. It remains to be seen whether freedom of belief and expression will prevail in his case.\n\nAny good revival doesn\u2019t just begin\u2026it endures. Let\u2019s hope this recent free speech revival turns out to be a good one.", "description": "When it comes to freedom of speech, we\u2019re in the .09/17/2019 19:25:07PM EST.", "authors": ["James", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/47/54370ed6-0842-4789-afc6-2ce065e25fef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
