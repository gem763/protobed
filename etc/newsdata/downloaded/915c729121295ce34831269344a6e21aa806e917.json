It\u2019s expected that Typhoon Mitag, the 17th of the season in Japan, will see high winds and heavy rain batter the region as the week progresses.\n\nAccording to the Japan Meteorological Agency, the Typhoon is moving towards a projected path that will see it miss the coastline, although World Rugby are still preparing for the worst should the tropical cyclone hit.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

However, in the best interests of the teams and the integrity of the tournament, we have informed France and the USA of the contingency plans in the event that adverse weather means that it is not possible to play the match in Fukuoka on the scheduled date.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to closely monitor this developing situation in partnership with our weather information provider, local authorities, transport providers and the teams, and will provide a further update tomorrow. Fans are advised to monitor official Rugby World Cup channels for any updates.\n\n\u201cFans visiting from outside Japan are reminded that while typhoons can vary in terms of strength and intensity, they are a normal occurrence in Japan and the vast majority have minimal impact on daily life.\u201d\n\nMitag is the third typhoon to set to hit Japan since World Cup teams started to arrive at the start of the month, following Faxai and Tapah earlier in the month.", "description": "England\u00a0could receive a huge boost to their Rugby World Cup quarter-final hopes after it emerged that\u00a0 Pool C rivals France\u00a0could have their game against the United States\u00a0on Wednesday abandoned.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/29/07/typhoon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
