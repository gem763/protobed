CAIWU said the second cleaner was accused of being involved in the disappearance of other unspecified items, but these charges were later dropped by Principle. Both cleaners have been suspended on full pay and are waiting to hear the outcome of an investigation by the cleaning firm. Google and Principle declined to comment on the matter.\n\nAt least 18 cleaners are now threatening to strike if Principle doesn't address the issues they have raised, and are publicly calling on Google to take action. \"Google is one of the most recognizable brands on the planet. It's also one of the wealthiest,\" the union wrote in a recent press release. \"So why can't they look after their cleaners properly?\"\n\nIn a statement, a Google spokesperson said: \"Our suppliers determine compensation and benefits for their employees and we hold them to our Supplier Code of Conduct, which requires that they comply with the law regarding legally-mandated wage and benefits, healthy and safe working conditions, prevention of harassment and discrimination.\"\n\nThey added: \"While we expect suppliers to provide their employees with channels to raise concerns or report issues, we also give our extended workforce access to the same helpline as Google employees to report concerns, including the option to report anonymously.\"\n\nThe cleaners are calling on Google to take action against the contractor. Courtesy of CAIWU\n\nGoogle's \"shadow workforce\" is coming under fire\n\nGoogle's workforce structure has come under intense scrutiny over the last year.\n\nA report from The New York Times in May 2019 revealed that the number of contract and temporary employees at Google, dubbed its \"shadow workforce,\" now outnumbers full-time employees. According to the Times, Google employs roughly 121,000 temps and contractors versus 102,000 full-time workers. (A Google spokesperson declined to provide workforce figures to Business Insider.)\n\nRead more: Google barred contractors from communicating with full-time Googlers on some internal Groups forums, and makes temps wear red badges that add to a 'sense of shame'\n\nThese employees, also known as TVCs (temporary, vendor, and contract workers) have become increasingly vocal about their treatment at Google's offices and are fighting for better pay and workplace protections.\n\nIn December 2019, a group that claimed to represent the TVCs sent an open letter to Google's CEO Sundar Pichai protesting working conditions. \"The exclusion of TVCs from important communications and fair treatment is part of a system of institutional racism, sexism, and discrimination,\" they wrote. \"TVCs are disproportionately people from marginalized groups who are treated as less deserving of compensation, opportunities, workplace protections, and respect. We wear different badges from full-time employees, which reinforces this arbitrary and discriminatory separation.\n\nIt added: \"Even when we're doing the same work as full-time employees, these jobs routinely fail to provide living wages and often offer minimal benefits. This affects not only us, but also our families and communities.\"\n\nWhile Google has come under particularly heavy fire over its use of contract workers, the model is widespread across the technology industry. According to data from OnContracting, a company that helps people find temporary contract jobs and which was cited by The Times, 40% to 50% of workers at technology firms are contractors.\n\nCost is likely a major driver of the model: OnContracting estimated that these companies can save, on average, as much as $100,000 a year per employee by opting for contract versus full-time employees.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai.

Google's contract cleaners in London earn a fraction of this, \u00a310.55 ($13) an hour \u2014 or around \u00a321,900 a year ($26,946) for those working full-time.\n\nHenry Ramirez, one of the union reps suspended in August, said that working conditions at Google's Kings Cross office deteriorated just over a year ago, when Principle started to cut back on the number of cleaners it sent there. Rather than having two cleaners on each side of each floor it was cut back to just one member of staff per floor, he said.\n\nAlberto Durango, general secretary for CAIWU, said that this contract setup means that Google is still able to boast that its cleaners are being paid the London Living Wage of \u00a310.55 an hour ($13), even as their workload doubled.\n\n\"They squeeze the workers to the maximum,\" he said. \"That's the problem of outsourcing ... people get exploited in this system.\"\n\nIf you are a worker at Google and have a story to share, contact this reporter at mhanbury@businessinsider.com, or securely via encrypted messaging app Signal at +1 (646) 768-4716 using a non-work phone.", "description": "Google's two-tier workforce is coming under fresh scrutiny as low-paid contract cleaners in the UK raise complaints.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9711322be65806614deb03?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
