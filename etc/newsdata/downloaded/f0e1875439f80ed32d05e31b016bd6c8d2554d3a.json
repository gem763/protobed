Obviously, we'll monitor the situation now, watch the games, hopefully get out and see him.\n\n'The key point, though, is that he's gone out of his way to make that clear,' the former Republic of Ireland midfielder said.\n\nThe towering defender has played all but one of Alanyaspor's Super Lig games this season\n\n'He phoned me directly. So there's an interest there. He's had a promising start over there, that's for sure.\n\nSTEVEN CAULKER'S SOLE ENGLAND GAME The then 20-year-old was just a fortnight shy of his 21st birthday when Roy Hodgson called him up for a friendly against Sweden, and he got off to a dream start to his International career - having not appeared during his first call up in August that year. Caulker started the friendly against Sweden in Stockholm on 14 November and scored a debut goal when he turned in a Steven Gerrard free kick from the right from three yards out. He played the first 74 minutes before being substituted with England leading 2\u20131. The team eventually lost 4\u20132.\n\n'Steven definitely could be an asset. He has Premier League experience and played for some big clubs. So we definitely can't discount it.\n\n'He's been in good form for his club side and doing well in the league. It seems like he's in a really good place at the minute, he's enjoying his football and life again.'\n\nCaulker's interest comes at a vital time for Scotland who face Euro 2020 qualifying clashes with Cyprus and Kazakhstan next month with a growing defensive injury list.\n\nThe towering defender has played all but one of Alanyaspor's Super Lig games this season and his form has helped them to the top of the table, losing just once - to Besiktas.\n\nHe qualifies for England through a Scottish grandmother and since his sole England cap was not a competitive match, it therefore would not prevent him switching allegiances.\n\nCaulker during a training session for Liverpool at Melwood in 2016, while on loan from QPR\n\nArticle 5.1 of FIFA's latest international eligibility rules states: '\u2026any player who has already participated in a match (either in full or in part) in an official competition of any category or any type of football for one association may not play an international match for a representative team of another association.'\n\nThe term 'official competition' refers to matches played for representative teams in competitions organised by FIFA or any confederation, i.e. not friendly games.\n\nCaulker has been on Scotland's radar for some time, according to former assistant boss McGhee who said in December 2013: 'We know who the boy is, we knew about him before he was at Tottenham. We're interested in looking at all players who meet the criteria.'", "description": "Caulker's performances at Tottenham earned him an England call up from Roy Hodgson in November 2012 and he even managed to grab a goal in a 4-2 friendly loss to Sweden.", "authors": ["Leigh Mcmanus For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/11/19437550-0-image-a-35_1570529569529.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
