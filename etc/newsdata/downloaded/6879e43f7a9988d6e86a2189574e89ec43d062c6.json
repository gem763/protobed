He had failed to qualify for the Sept. 12 debate that featured the 10 leading candidates.\n\n\"The bar is so high so early that for a lot of us \u2014 clearly, some of my fellow chief executives, governors \u2014 couldn't make that cut,\" de Blasio said. \"It's clear to me it's a high bar, and that it's one I'm not going to be able to meet.\"", "description": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bsaid during an MSNBC television appearance\u00a0on Friday that he is dropping out of the 2020 presidential campaign.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5290955.1568979903!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/usa-election-democrats.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
