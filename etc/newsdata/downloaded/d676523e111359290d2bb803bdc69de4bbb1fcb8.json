Elizabeth Warren (17%)\n\nSen Bernie Sanders (15%)\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (7%)\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (5%)\n\nThe state of pay: 1-in-4 voters said they are undecided or supporting a lower-tier candidate, and half of undecided voters said they won\u2019t decide until the weeks leading up to their state\u2019s contest \u2014 meaning the race could shift significantly in February.\n\nThough Biden holds a 2-to-1 lead over Warren, his nearest competitor, there are enough voters who are undecided or supporting a lower-tier candidate to give any candidate a chance the nomination.\n\nWhat voters want: 3-in-4 primary voters said they are motivated by the same priorities that drew them to the polls in 2018, namely health care costs, the economy and beating Trump.\n\nA plurality (43%) of primary voters identified reducing the cost of health care as one of their top priorities, while just 16% said replacing the Affordable Care Act with Medicare for All is a top priority.\n\nBy a 3-to-1 margin, voters said they want a candidate who can mend but not end capitalism.\n\n68% said that they would prefer a Democratic nominee best positioned to beat Trump than a nominee that matches their policy preferences.\n\nIdeologically, the polled voters identified themselves with former President Obama. On an ideological scale from 0 (liberal) to 100 (conservative), the average self-identified score was 46, the same score the voters gave Obama.\n\nThis data suggests that candidates could be taking a risk by criticizing Obama\u2019s record, which has happened in the early debates.\n\nThe poll was conducted from Sept. 19-22 from a representative sample of 1,200 likely 2020 Democratic primary voters with a margin of error of +/- 2.8%\n\nGo deeper: The 2020 impeachment campaign", "description": "Just 16% said replacing the Affordable Care Act with Medicare for All is a top priority.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/ble8POji7WKxqjn8tpgG7GkzWwY=/0x93:800x543/1920x1080/2019/10/03/1570100585054.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
