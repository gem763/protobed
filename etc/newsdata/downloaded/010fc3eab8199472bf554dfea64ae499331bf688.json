Trump voiced concern but did not blame Moscow.\n\nThe 24 Ukrainian sailors detained in the operation were returned last month as part of a prisoner exchange.\n\nAnderson, and his successor in the Ukraine job, Catherine Croft, both testified to House committees on Wednesday about the role played by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in foiling state department efforts to bolster the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in the face of Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn his testimony, Anderson quoted the former national security adviser, John Bolton, as saying: \u201cGiuliani was a key voice with the president on Ukraine which could be an obstacle to increased White House engagement.\u201d On Wednesday, the House committees asked Bolton to testify on 7 November, but it is unclear whether he will attend.\n\nBolton\u2019s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, is currently seeking a court ruling on whether to comply with his congressional subpoena in the face of a White House order not to testify.\n\nAt the other side of Congress, the nominee to become ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, faced pointed questions on Wednesday at confirmation hearings in the Senate about Giuliani and the split US policy towards Russia and Ukraine.\n\nSullivan, currently the deputy secretary of state, said he was aware of Giuliani\u2019s role in a campaign against the former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Asked if he knew Trump\u2019s lawyer was \u201cseeking to smear\u201d Yovanovitch, he replied: \u201cI believe he was, yes.\u201d\n\nSullivan confirmed he had been shown a dossier of material attacking Yovanovitch, saying it had provided by the White House to the state department legal adviser, but he was not aware it had been put together by Giuliani. He said the dossier \u201cdidn\u2019t provide to me a basis for taking action against our ambassador\u201d.\n\nHe said that Pompeo gave Sullivan no explanation for the decision to recall Yovanovitch before the end of her posting, other than she had \u201clost the confidence of the president\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs I understand, [Trump] may decide that he doesn\u2019t like my testimony today and he doesn\u2019t want me to go to Russia. The president can decide when he loses confidence in his ambassador \u2013 then that person is not going to continue as ambassador,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nNot just Russia: China and Iran may target US elections, experts say Read more\n\nSullivan sought to avoid taking a position on the testimony by several former and current state department officials that the president, through Giuliani, had made a White House meeting and US military aid dependent on the Ukrainian government investigating Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\n\u201cSoliciting investigations into a domestic political opponent \u2013 I don\u2019t think that would be in accord with our values,\u201d Sullivan said. But he would not confirm that was what the president had done.\n\nDemocratic senators signaled that they were prepared to support Sullivan\u2019s nomination as an experienced and respected diplomat, acknowledging the difficult position he was in. But they expressed concern he had not done more to find out what Trump and Giuliani were trying to achieve in Ukraine.\n\nThe ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, Bob Menendez, told Sullivan he had been playing the role of \u201csee no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to go to Russia, and you\u2019re going to be saying one set of things based upon your testimony here,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cAnd we have the president who, in his public statements, is totally aligned differently than what you\u2019re going to be saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you understand the incredibly difficult job that you\u2019re going to have as a result of that?\u201d Menendez asked Sullivan.\n\n\u201cI would say, senator, you\u2019ve cited the president\u2019s statements. I\u2019d cite the president\u2019s actions,\u201d the nominee replied, listing sanctions the administration had imposed on Russia.", "description": "State department aide makes revelation during testimony, while Russia envoy nominee John Sullivan grilled at confirmation hearing", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61274789e4e676e6e03d5b91c82457d48e224e9e/0_195_4508_2706/master/4508.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f0f0d3b32a51f8c84068818569415c23", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
