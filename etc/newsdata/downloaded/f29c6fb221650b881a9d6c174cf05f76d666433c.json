Both are worth fighting.\n\nThe twin threats were on display at a debate between four members of the European Parliament ahead of last May's election. The two far-right politicians, Dominik Tarczy\u0144ski from Poland\u2019s Law and Justice party, and the Alternative for Germany\u2019s Maximilian Krah, denounced Islam and demanded protection for a \u201cChristian Europe.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, their opponents, German Green Jo Leinen and Dutch liberal Sophie in 't Veld, lashed out against their own bogeyman: GAFA \u2014 Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. If the otherwise liberal left is to be believed, these Big Tech giants aren\u2019t resources and services that can empower local businesses; they\u2019re behemoths that are invading the Continent, destroying local traditional industries, killing jobs, avoiding taxes and eviscerating European culture.\n\nSadly, Leinen and in \u2018t Veld aren\u2019t the exception. When European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager appears for her hearing at the European Parliament on October 8, she can be expected to use some of the same, unfortunate, populist anti-tech discourse.\n\nEuropean tech policies need to be based on facts, not emotions. For several years now, European leaders have been screaming that digital tech companies do not pay their fair share of tax.\n\nAs competition commissioner, the Danish liberal made her reputation by collecting billions of euros in allegedly unpaid taxes from Apple and billions more in antitrust fines against Google. In her new expanded position as the Commission\u2019s digital czar, she can be expected to continue her competition crusade against Facebook and Apple \u2014 as well as legislate tough new liability rules on the digital platforms.\n\nTo be sure, Big Tech must assume new responsibilities as the internet has moved to the economic and social center stage. It must protect individual privacy. It must pay a fair share of taxes. It should not be allowed to run rampant over small competitors. And it needs to take responsibility for the eruption of a volcano of online hate speech. But the rhetoric must not be overblown \u2014 or, worse, turned into counterproductive policy.\n\nEurope needs to be careful and avoid simplistic, dangerous anti-tech populism. Much of the discourse about tech emanating from the new European Commission revolves around \u201cdigital sovereignty.\u201d Under this slogan, European lawmakers warn that the Continent is too dependent on foreign-owned American and Chinese digital infrastructure. The strategy, among other elements, includes a project to develop a European cloud-hosting service named Gaia-X.\n\nMoves like this will hurt, not save, European tech. It will raise costs, and perhaps most worryingly, it will chip away at European business competitiveness. Europe\u2019s software strengths build on top of basic American cloud infrastructure. If Europe\u2019s burgeoning numbers of startups are to scale, they will need to use the most scalable, cost-effective services.\n\nEuropean tech policies need to be based on facts, not emotions. For several years now, European leaders have been screaming that digital tech companies do not pay their fair share of tax. France already has imposed a specific \u201cdigital\u201d tax, under which it exempted the only French company in scope. Incoming Commissioner Paolo Gentilloni has vowed to reintroduce a digital tax proposal. And while there may be legitimate debates about where digital companies pay their taxes, few if any studies show that they pay less overall corporate tax than non-digital companies.\n\nAnother potential overreach concerns speech. Although genuine concerns exist about illegal hate speech, the liabilities on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter should not be made so large as to curb free expression. A proposed online anti-terrorism law should be narrowed to focus only on groups which the EU has named on its terrorism list; companies should be fined only if they systematically flout warnings to keep up this content, not just if they make a mistake.\n\nEurope has leaped ahead of the rest of the world by instituting its strict online General Data Protection Regulation law. It should avoid now muddling its success by revising it or by passing a new e-privacy bill, which often contradicts GDPR and which would block many forms of innovation, including online translation of emails and other documents.\n\nThe previous European Commission came to power determined to boost tech. In May 2015, it launched an ambitious program to create a Digital Single Market. Through 16 initiatives \u2014 including an end to unjustified blocking of content at national borders, a revamp of copyright, and an overhaul of telecom rules \u2014 the Commission aimed to unite Europe\u2019s fragmented digital economies into a unified market encompassing more than 500 million consumers.\n\nIt failed. Instead of creating a giant pan-European market, the Commission yielded to rights-holders, traditional industries and anti-tech populists and reinforced fragmentation. Instead of operating from a single \u201chome\u201d country to serve the entire European Union, as is now possible, the new audiovisual rules will force streaming video providers such as Netflix to comply with national content quotas of at least 20 percent subsidized local national production in each country where they operate.\n\nThis time around, a new Commission should refocus its ambitions at least as much on breaking down the barriers blocking cross-border e-commerce than in reigning it. Unfortunately, it looks more likely to treat Big Tech as a populist danger than an opportunity to boost economic growth and consumer satisfaction.\n\nWilliam Echikson, a former senior policy manager at Google, runs the Digital Forum at the Centre For European Policy Studies.", "description": "Treating digital companies like a threat will only hurt European startups.", "authors": ["William Echikson", "Mark Scott", "Thibault Larger", "Nicholas Vinocur", "Simon Van Dorpe", "Laurens Cerulus"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1091266780-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
