At times he had had depression although he had chosen not to take medication. His dependency on her appears to have been both emotional and financial.\n\n\"You will hear evidence about the nature of that relationship from witnesses who knew them both and with whom they both exchanged messages.\n\n\"With these witnesses they both discussed Amy's increasing unhappiness and dissatisfaction with her relationship with the defendant.\n\n\"For example, she was unhappy about the fact that he liked to engage in cross-dressing - dressing in women's clothing - when they were being intimate together.\n\n\"A few weeks before her death Amy Parsons began to become increasingly fond of a colleague at work, a man called James Saunders.\n\n\"The connection they each felt grew and in the fullness of time their feelings and affections for each other developed to the extent that they began a sexual relationship.\n\n\"Amy Parsons did tell the defendant about this. He told one friend that he blamed himself somewhat as he had pushed her to him.\n\n\"However, the defendant was unhappy and told people he felt hurt. The evidence suggests that he felt he was losing Amy.\n\n\"You will hear from people he spoke with and exchanged messages with. It appears there were rows between the defendant and Amy.\n\n\"As time went on his unhappiness developed into jealousy and anger.\n\n\"He described the new man in her life as a \"b****d\", a \"creep\", a \"scumbag\", a \"bloody knob head\", \"a complete tool\" and a \"f*****g twat\".\n\n\"He messaged him (Saunders) saying \"back off.\"\n\n\"He began stalking Amy Parsons, following her home from work and going to a restaurant to try to see her with James Saunders.\n\n\"He tried to monitor what she was doing, accessing her laptop and studying on her account her use of Uber taxis.\n\n\"The evidence suggests that Amy Parsons was very conscious of the difficult situation in which she found herself and was anxious to try to do the right thing, to the best of her ability.\n\n\"In her contacts with others you will see her agonising over her relationship with the defendant and she appears to have wanted, as much as possible, to minimise any pain caused to the defendant.\n\n\"The strain of it all on Amy Parsons was noticed by a close friend of hers.\n\n\"The defendant meanwhile was becoming increasingly and deeply unhappy and angry.\n\n\"Events culminated on the evening of Thursday 25 April 2019. Amy Parsons had told a friend at lunch that day that she needed to sort things out with the defendant.\n\n\"It seems she had decided to go home and end the relationship.\n\n\"As for the defendant his actions suggest that he had got to the stage where he basically thought - if I can't have her, nobody else will have her. And that night he did do 'something stupid'.\n\n\"He killed her in the bathroom where she was showering he started battering her to the head with a metal bar\n\n\"A neighbour heard a woman screaming but didn't appreciate what was happening.\n\n\"The blows knocked Amy Parsons down off her feet, no doubt slipping in the wet bath.\n\n\"It was a brutal attack on a woman who, while she was showering, was obviously unarmed and wholly defenceless, a woman who was entitled to feel safe and secure in her own home.\n\n\"The attack however did not immediately kill her. The evidence suggests she was still alive in the minutes that followed the defendant's blows.\n\n\"He must have realised this, however he left her in a terrible state with those life-threatening injuries to her face and head.\n\n\"He fled from the scene, eager no doubt to avoid arrest for what he knew he had just done.'\n\nDeakin-White from Whitechapel, east London, has admitted manslaughter but denies murder.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Roderick Deakin-White, 38, is claimed to have murdered 35-year-old Amy Parsons, in their Whitechapel home after she started seeing a colleague at work", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18668473.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_HMP_CHP_230719Slug_045JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
