REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth\n\nWilliams, who stands 5ft 7in tall, scored 60 tries in 91 matches over an 11-year international career, relying on pace and footwork in a game increasing dominated by power.\n\nAt this World Cup, the likes of South Africa\u2019s Cheslin Kolbe and Japan\u2019s Kotaro Matsushima have shown that lightning speed and dancing feet can still be effective in the modern game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a breath of fresh air,\u201d Williams, 42, told Reuters at an event organised by Rugby World Cup partners Land Rover.\n\n\u201cIt did seem to be going that way where you had complete athletes on the wing who were running the 100 metres in less than 11 seconds and benching 200 kilos in the gym.\n\n\u201cBut for the last two or three seasons, we\u2019ve seen the likes of Cheslin and Matsushima making defences work. It\u2019s very difficult for guys like Eben Etzebeth at 6ft 7in getting low and trying to tackle the smaller guys around the waist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s starting to suit the smaller guys now, it\u2019s certainly been a breath of fresh air where the star players have been 5ft 6in, 5ft 7in, under 80 kilos and have been scoring four and five tries and setting the World Cup alight.\n\n\u201cLong may it continue.\u201d\n\nKolbe, who is also 5ft 7in tall, missed South Africa\u2019s semi-final win over Wales but coach Rassie Erasmus expects him to be available for Saturday\u2019s final against England.\n\nWilliams said he had been impressed by the South African\u2019s whole game, not just his running.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a revelation for South Africa, he\u2019s just a joy to watch,\u201d said Williams.\n\n\u201cNot only does he score tries and have great feet but he\u2019s a warrior. He puts his body on the line, he tackles like he\u2019s 6ft 5in and he runs into brick walls like he\u2019s 6ft 5in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that with other smaller players at this World Cup. If a coach tells you to do it, you do it, whether it hurts or not.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see him fit and play in the final. I\u2019ll have my fingers crossed for Cheslin because I love watching him play.\u201d\n\nRegardless of whether Kolbe plays at Yokohama, Williams thinks that some of the greatest outside back talent in the game will be on display at Yokohama International Stadium on Saturday.\n\nWhile South Africa have Kolbe, Makazole Mapimpi and Sbu Nkosi, England are likely to start with Anthony Watson and Jonny May.\n\n\u201cI think Watson has been busy, great feet, probably hasn\u2019t scored as many tries as he\u2019s deserved but he\u2019s beaten the man every time he\u2019s got the ball,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe all know what Mapimpi is capable of even though he spent most of the semi-final chasing kicks. Jonny May is a true finisher, absolute gas on the wing there.\n\n\u201cThe back three of both sides are absolutely deadly but I think it suits England at the moment because they do try and get the ball to their wingers whereas South Africa kick and try and force the error before getting the ball to Mapimpi and Nkosi.\u201d", "description": "Shane Williams once looked like the last of the dying breed as a smaller man in the game of rugby and the Wales and British and Irish Lions winger has been delighted by the re-emergence of the diminutive back at this World Cup.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446492923&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0QD", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
