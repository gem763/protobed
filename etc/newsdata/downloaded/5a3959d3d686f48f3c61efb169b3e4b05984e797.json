Israel has good reason to be deeply worried.\n\nUntil 2000, the peaceful transition of power in the wake of elections was a feature of American democracy that everyone took for granted. In 2000, the Democrats shifted. They refused to accept the election results in Florida that gave Bush his victory in the state, and through it, in the electoral college, until the Supreme Court ruled that the results were legitimate. Even afterwards, many Democrats considered Bush\u2019s victory and his presidency illegitimate.\n\nIn retrospect, the Democrats\u2019 refusal to accept the legitimacy of the 2000 election results marked the beginning of the party\u2019s radicalization.\n\nSince Donald Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016, the speed and depth of the party\u2019s radical transformation has gone into overdrive.\n\nThe day after the election, Democrats coined a new term in American politics, \u201cresistance.\u201d Until then, the side that lost a presidential election was the \u201copposition.\u201d But the Democrats don\u2019t simply \u201coppose\u201d Trump, they \u201cresist\u201d him.\n\nThe distinction is profound. An opponent recognizes the basic legitimacy of the person he opposes. A resister does not. The purpose of the anti-Trump resistance is not to offer an alternative path for governing. It is to nullify Trump\u2019sis presidency by among other things delegitimizing and dehumanizing Trump his family, associates and supporters. The resistance seeks to paralyze Trump\u2019s presidency to prevent him from wielding the power of office and oust him from that office as quickly as possible.\n\nTo this end, for instance, the Democratic minority in the Senate has used procedural rules to slow-roll Trump\u2019s appointments to senior positions in the executive branch and impede his ability to govern.\n\nThe resistance is not limited to the partisan arena. During the 2016 elections, and to an even greater degree in their aftermath, Democrats in the US media and in the federal government \u2013 particularly in the intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic arms of government \u2014 joined Democratic politicians in their efforts to nullify the Trump candidacy and later presidency. Like the politicians, they have used the power of their positions to undermine and subvert Trump\u2019s presidency to foment his departure from office.\n\nWe saw extra-political resistance in action with the attempt by senior FBI, CIA and Justice Department officials to criminalize Trump as a Russian agent through the use of the Clinton campaign\u2019s fraudulent \u201cSteele dossier.\u201d The senior federal officials used the dossier, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele for the Clinton campaign as a means to open an investigation against Trump\u2019s campaign and against Trump himself and then cause the appointment of a Special Counsel to investigate their partisan-financed, false allegations.\n\nAs former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy wrote in his book Ball of Collusion which examines the Russia collusion investigation, the liberal establishment in Washington, \u201cexploited its control of law-enforcement and intelligence to help Clinton and undermine Trump. This is a scandalous abuse of power.\u201d\n\nWhen, after nearly two years, Special Counsel Robert Mueller closed down shop with no case against Trump, the Democrats in politics, the media and the federal government seized on a telephone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Vlodomir Zelensky in July and presented it as the ultimate proof of Trump\u2019s criminal nature, treating it as a \u201chigh crime\u201d for which he must be impeached.\n\nThe Ukraine call impeachment ploy began in August when a CIA officer with ties to former Vice President and Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden submitted a whistleblower complaint to the inspector general of the intelligence community. The CIA officer alleged that during the course of a telephone conversation with Zelensky, Trump conditioned US military assistance to Ukraine on the Ukrainian prosecution opening a criminal investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that paid Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden millions of dollars while his father as Vice President was responsible for US\u2019s bilateral ties with Ukraine.\n\nBased on the whistleblower complaint, the Democrats claim Trump subordinated US national interests to his political interest of winning reelection in 2020. The fact that Biden himself bragged publicly that he forced the Ukrainian government to fire the state prosecutor who was conducting a criminal probe of Burisma by conditioning the provision of a billion dollars in US loan guarantees to Ukraine on his removal from office, is of no interest to the Democrats. In addition to the CIA officer, according to Politico, the allegations of malfeasance that form the basis of the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry against Trump are being supported by State Department officials known for their hostility towards Trump.\n\nJust as the Democrats aren\u2019t bothered by Biden\u2019s apparently corrupt behavior, so they are unmoved by the fact that Trump disproved the whistleblower allegation by releasing the full transcript of his conversation with Zelensky. From the transcript it is apparent Trump made no connection between US military aid to Kiev and the actions of the Ukrainian state prosecution.\n\nDespite the self-evident absurdity of the basis for their impeachment drive, the Democrats are conducting hearings and taking testimony from federal employees in secret rooms, and barring their Republican colleagues from attending.\n\nThe media aren\u2019t merely supporting this farce. They are taking a leading role in propounding it. Last week, the investigative journalism organization Project Veritas released recorded footage of CNN President Jeff Zucker instructing his top news executives to push the impeachment story in their programming.\n\nA transcript of a meeting in August between New York Times editor Dean Banquet and the paper\u2019s editorial staff revealed a similar obsession at the Times with advancing the anti-Trump resistance.\n\nThe radicalization of the Democratic party and party members in the media and government should be deeply worrying to Israel because as the party has radicalized it has shifted ever farther away from Israel. An event this coming weekend shows just how deeply and quickly it has abandoned its previous support for Israel.\n\nSaturday, October 26, J Street will open its annual three-day conference. J Street was founded in 2008 with the support of anti-Israel billionaire donor George Soros who first proposed its establishment in a series of meetings with anti-Israel Jewish American donors in 2006. Soros laid out his vision for the Jewish anti-Israel lobby in an article in the New York Review of Books in 2007. Soros envisioned a leftist Jewish group that would push an anti-Israel agenda in the name of the community and so diminish the power among Democrats of the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC.\n\nSoros tried out his idea in 2006. He organized a group of dovish Jewish pro-PLO groups. They formed an ad hoc coalition to scupper the Palestinian Anti-Terror Act. The act, which enjoyed overwhelming Congressional support in both houses, was backed by AIPAC. Its goal was to update US policy towards the Palestinian Authority following Hamas\u2019s victory in the January 2006 PA elections.\n\nPresenting themselves as \u201cpro-Israel and pro-peace\u201d the Soros-backed group blindsided AIPAC and managed to scuttle the initiative. Buoyed by the success, ahead of the 2008 presidential elections, J Street launched.\n\nLike the ad hoc consortium of the pro-PLO groups in 2006, J Street also insists that it is \u201cpro-Israel.\u201d But like its precursor, its actions expose the falsity of its claim. J Street was a key lobbyist for President Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran which was devastating for Israel. It has campaigned to defeat pro-Israel lawmakers and to elect anti-Israel lawmakers. For instance, in 2012, J Street actively campaigned against Representatives Joe Walsh and Allen West, two of Israel\u2019s most outspoken supporters in the House. In 2018, during the Democratic primaries, when it mattered, J Street supported Rashida Tlaib\u2019s bid for office. J Street endorsed former Nation of Islam spokesman Keith Ellison\u2019s campaigns for the House of Representatives, and J Street condemned Israel for barring Ellison\u2019s successor Ilhan Omar and Tlaib from entering Israel to lead a BDS tour last summer.\n\nIn 2014, only 37 House members failed to support a House measure to fund the Iron Dome system. Eleven of them were supported by J Street.\n\nWhile J Street claims that it opposes the anti-Semitic BDS campaign, its campus outfit J Street U legitimizes BDS campus groups and activists.\n\nPolitically, J Street has campaigned against anti-BDS legislation.\n\nIn 2014, a large majority of members of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations voted against J Street\u2019s request for membership in the organization. The decision was eminently reasonable. 95 percent of American Jews support Israel. The group that seeks to serve as the mouthpiece of the entire Jewish community could not permit an organization that deliberately harms Israel to become a member.\n\nIsrael was not involved in the Conference of President\u2019s decision-making. But it is a testament to Israel\u2019s concern about J Street\u2019s growing legitimacy that Amb. Ron Dermer reportedly does not meet with J Street representatives.\n\nIn March, AIPAC held its annual policy conference. The Democratic presidential candidates opted not to attend. Over the weekend, five Democratic presidential hopefuls will participate in J Street conference.\n\nAnd they aren\u2019t alone. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer are also scheduled to address the J Street audience. J Street\u2019s ability to draw top Democrats, including the presidential candidates who refused to attend the AIPAC conference makes clear just how comfortable the Democratic leadership has become with their party\u2019s sharp turn away from Israel. This weekend the top Democrats will publicly identify with an organization whose easily discerned purpose is to water down and undermine the US-Israel alliance.\n\nThen too, last weekend two top Democratic presidential candidates, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Pete Buttigieg indicated they support using US military aid to Israel as a means to coerce the Israeli government into denying the property rights of Israeli Jews in Judea, Samaria and unified Jerusalem. In July, their fellow leading presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders expressed a similar position.\n\nThese statements are noteworthy for two reasons. First, they show how ridiculous the impeachment hearings are. There is no substantive difference between Trump\u2019s alleged use of US military assistance to Ukraine as a means to coerce Ukraine to bow to his will and their intention to use US military aid to Israel to achieve a similar outcome. But of course, Warren, Buttigieg and Sanders are coddled by the partisan media and left untouched by the bureaucracy. And Trump is being subjected to an impeachment probe.\n\nThe second noteworthy aspect of their threatened action is what it means for the future of US-Israel ties in a post-Trump America. With the Democrats in the media and the federal bureaucracy now full partners in their party\u2019s radical actions and initiatives, there is every reason to expect that after they finish with Trump, they will turn their attention to Israel.\n\nOriginally published in Israel Hayom.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://carolineglick.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sanders-J-Street-e1572167419396.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
