The two most unhappy countries at this move are Russia & China, because they love seeing us bogged down, watching over a quagmire [and] spending big dollars to do so,\" Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.\n\nIn an earlier tweet, Trump said it's now up to the region to decide what to do with captured ISIS fighters currently held in Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) facilities to the south of Turkey's initially proposed safe zone.\n\nWhile U.S. officials have praised the efforts of the Kurds, Trump appeared to downplay their role, saying they were \"paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so.\"\n\nHe also directed an unspecified threat to Turkey's economy should the NATO ally run afoul of the United States in the wake of the agreement.\n\nAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!). They must, with Europe and others, watch over... \u2014@realDonaldTrump\n\nBut through the course of Monday, lawmakers from both parties on Capitol Hill condemned the decision, which critics fear could open the way for a Turkish strike on Kurdish-led fighters in the area.\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement: \"A precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. And it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, was also displeased with the White House statement.\n\n\"If press reports are accurate, this is a disaster in the making,\" said Graham, who outlined in a series of tweets some of the potential consequences of the action and promised Senate action to try to reverse the decision.\n\nJust spoke to Sen <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisVanHollen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ChrisVanHollen</a> about situation in Syria. <br><br>We will introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if they invade Syria and will call for their suspension from NATO if they attack Kurdish forces who assisted the U.S. in the destruction of the ISIS Caliphate. \u2014@LindseyGrahamSC\n\nRepublican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Democratic counterpart Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut released a joint statement demanding an explanation.\n\n\"Barring a reversal of this decision, the administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests,\" the statement read.\n\nAmong the few to support Trump's decision was Republican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a noted critic of interventionist U.S. policy.\n\nI stand with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@realDonaldTrump</a> today as he once again fulfills his promises to stop our endless wars and have a true America First foreign policy. \u2014@RandPaul\n\nIn New York, United Nations secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called on all parties in northeast Syria to exercise maximum restraint, his spokesperson said.\n\n\"The secretary general also emphasizes that civilian and civilian infrastructure need to be protected at all times and that sustained, unimpeded and safe humanitarian access to civilians in need must be guaranteed,\" said Stephane Dujarric.\n\nEarlier, the UN's regional humanitarian co-ordinator for the Syria crisis, told reporters in Geneva that his group had drawn up contingency plans to provide aid.\n\n\"We are hoping for the best but preparing for the worst,\" said Panos Moumtzis.\n\nTurkish and American soldiers stand near a former YPG military point during a joint U.S.-Turkey patrol, near Tel Abyad, Syria, on Sept. 8. Representatives of the Turkish Kurds say they feel betrayed by the decision from the White House. (Rodi Said/Reuters)\n\nA U.S. official said American troops had withdrawn from two observation posts on the border, at Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ain.\n\n\"The Department of Defence made clear to Turkey \u2014 as did the president \u2014 that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in northern Syria. The U.S. Armed Forces will not support, or be involved in any such operation,\" Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman added in a statement later.\n\nU.S. promises 'can't be trusted': top Democrat\n\nTurkey under Recep Erdogan has long argued for the establishment of a roughly 30-kilometre \"safe zone\" along the border, under Turkish control, driving back the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia \u2014 the dominant force in the SDF alliance that Ankara considers a terrorist organization and a threat to its national security.\n\nThe United States helped the YPG defeat ISIS militants in Syria, and had been seeking a joint \"security mechanism\" with Turkey along the border to meet Turkey's security needs without threatening the SDF.\n\nThe SDF accused Washington on Monday of reneging on an ally which spearheaded the fight against Islamic State in Syria, and warned that it would have a \"great negative\" impact on the war against the jihadists.\n\nBased on our confidence in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/US?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#US</a> efforts in the Security Mechanism agreement, we implemented all our commitments to remove military fortifications between Tal Abyad & SereKaniye, withdraw combat forces with heavy weapons, risking a security vacum as a result of the agreement. \u2014@cmoc_sdf\n\nAbdulkarim Omar, who acts as foreign minister for the Syrian Kurds, said Monday the U.S. troop withdrawal from the border will have \"catastrophic consequences\" because Kurdish-led forces would be preoccupied with defending the border, instead of protecting detention facilities or the crowded al-Hol camp, which houses over 73,000 people, many of them ISIS families and supporters.\n\nThe White House statement made pointed reference to European allies, saying many of the captured ISIS fighters came from those countries, which had resisted U.S. calls to take them back.\n\nBut Eliot Engel, the Democratic chair of the House's foreign relations committee, said the decision \"sends the message to partners and adversaries alike that the United States won't keep its word and can't be trusted.\"\n\nIn the first Turkish comment following the statement, Erdogan's spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey's \"safe zone\" plan was within the framework of Syria's territorial integrity.\n\n\"The safe zone has two aims: to secure our borders by clearing away terrorist elements and to achieve the return of refugees in a safe way,\" Kalin wrote on Twitter.\n\nTurkey says it wants to settle up to two million Syrian refugees in the zone. It currently hosts 3.6 million Syrians sheltering from the more than eight-year-old conflict in their homeland.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan, shown, and U.S. President Donald Trump spoke on the weekend, and are set to meet in Washington next month. (Jorge Silva/Reuters)\n\nErdogan's communications director, Fahrettin Altun, said Monday that Turkey would provide services to the areas it takes from the YPG militia.\n\nTurkey's two previous operations into Syria showed it can deliver a governance model and security for all Syrians, said Altun. He said Ankara's primary goal was to combat militants and prevent the resurgence of ISIS.\n\nAfter the Erdogan-Trump phone call, the Turkish presidency said the two leaders had agreed to meet in Washington next month.\n\nIt is not the first time Trump has announced a decision publicly concerning the region that has clashed with the opinions of top military and diplomatic officials.\n\nDefence Secretary James Mattis last December announced his resignation, in part, over Trump's announcement that he would soon pull all of the approximately 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria, as did Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to Syria.\n\nMcGurk offered scathing criticism in several tweets after the latest White House announcement.\n\n\"The [White House] statement tonight on Syria after Trump spoke with Erdogan demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of anything happening on the ground,\" said McGurk.\n\nNikki Haley, Trump's former ambassador to the United Nations, also tweeted her disapproval, stating that turning away from allies \"is a big mistake.\"", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday defended his administration's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, saying it was too costly to keep supporting U.S-allied Kurdish-led forces in the region fighting ISIS.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5311383.1570430679!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1174184709.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
