There is an election coming soon. Yet, bizarrely, Labour is behaving as if it is already lost.\n\nAs rival camps jockey for position in the election\u2019s aftermath, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s allies are trying to ensure the left retains its grip on the party. That\u2019s the only explanation for the botched attempt to abolish the deputy leader\u2019s post held by Tom Watson, the figurehead of Labour\u2019s centrists, and for a rule change that will allow the left-dominated national executive committee (NEC) to choose the acting leader if the leader steps down, instead of Watson taking over by default, as Margaret Beckett and Harriet Harman did when their respective leaders stepped down.\n\nThe fin de siecle atmosphere was reinforced by the spectacular resignation letter of Andrew Fisher, Corbyn\u2019s director of policy, with a blast at the intolerance of the clique around the leader for showing \u201clack of professionalism, competence and human decency\u201d. He added: \u201cI no longer have faith we will succeed.\u201d Although Fisher will stay for the election, his exit shows that the Corbyn inner circle is shrinking. \u201cIt\u2019s over, and they know it,\u201d one MP critic told me.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nInstead of the pre-election unity the leadership hoped for, it has disunity. The sea air here in Brighton is thick with talk of plots to remove Corbyn. They won\u2019t happen with the election so close, but had Watson\u2019s job been abolished, there could have been a formal split, with scores of MPs walking out of Corbyn\u2019s party altogether.\n\nLabour is a powder keg ready to ignite, and the successful defenestration of Watson could have been the spark. Corbyn was wise to make a tactical retreat, but plenty of damage was still done; behind the scenes, tensions are now out in the open. As Watson told a fringe meeting: \u201cThis is, honestly, a battle for the soul of the Labour Party.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Meaty policy announcements \u2013 free personal social care for pensioners, free prescriptions and a 32-hour average working week \u2013 are being eclipsed by the battle over whether Corbynism can survive after Corbyn.\n\nThe Labour leader\u2019s handling of Brexit has fuelled the internal criticism. True, Labour has moved a long way towards a Final Say referendum since last year\u2019s annual conference. But Corbyn still sits stubbornly on the fence, unable to come out for Remain but in danger of being pushed into a policy he does not believe in by a grassroots revolt. Blairites smile at the irony of Corbyn triangulating between Remain and Leave, and mobilising the trade unions\u2019 50 per cent share of the conference votes to defeat the constituency parties like the \u201cright-wing\u201d leaders who preceded him.\n\nWhatever this bitterly divided conference ultimately votes for, it is quite possible that Labour\u2019s policy will still be as clear as mud, and that Corbyn\u2019s \u201cwait and see\u201d approach, offering a referendum with a choice between a Labour Brexit deal and Remain, might prevail in the party\u2019s election manifesto.\n\nThe fear among many Labour MPs is that such a fudge will be impossible to sell on the doorstep, especially when they\u2019re competing with the Tories\u2019 clear Leave message and the Liberal Democrats\u2019 equally clear pledge to revoke Article 50. Both offer weary voters an end to the Brexit saga; Labour\u2019s plan to negotiate its own deal would prolong it. MPs also fear Corbyn\u2019s plan for him to remain neutral in a referendum would not pass muster, making it even harder to present him as a prime minister-in-waiting.\n\nCorbyn allies insist he deserves credit for trying to bring a divided country together by straddling Leave and Remain, and refusing to join the \u201cculture war\u201d waged by the Tories and Lib Dems. They envisage a \u201cheart versus head\u201d appeal to Remainers who are currently tempted to vote Lib Dem, but who might just hold their nose and vote Labour in the polling booth as the only way to stop the Tories. Corbyn\u2019s pitch to these voters: \u201cIt\u2019s me or Boris.\u201d\n\nTo try to stem the Lib Dem tide, Labour backbenchers who backed a referendum and revoke in Commons votes remind constituents of this in their campaign material. But many fear that if Labour doesn\u2019t get unequivocally behind Remain, a Lib Dem revival will help the Tories win Con-Lab marginals, in some cases with a lower share of the vote than in 2017.\n\nAll that said, despite Labour\u2019s dire poll ratings, the Brexit crisis and Boris Johnson\u2019s flirtation with no deal mean the party still has a chance of winning power by forming a minority government. But you wouldn\u2019t know it at this conference.", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s a good job there\u2019s not an election coming,\u201d a Labour MP quipped sarcastically as he surveyed the wreckage of the party\u2019s Brighton conference.
