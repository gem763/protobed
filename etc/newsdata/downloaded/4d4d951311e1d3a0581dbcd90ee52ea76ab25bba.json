On paper, Netanyahu lost four seats since April\u2019s election. The real number is closer to eight, since in the interim Likud merged with a small sister party. \u201cBibi, King of Israel,\u201d who was expected to rule indefinitely, has been cut down to size.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for anyone alarmed by the turn of Netanyahu\u2019s politics in recent years from conservative pragmatist to political desperado .\n\nIn recent months, Netanyahu has courted far-right votes by signaling his willingness to sit in coalition with a racist party with a terrorist past, courted settler votes by promising to annex large chunks of the West Bank, and infuriated Democratic lawmakers by bending to Donald Trump\u2019s demand to bar Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib from visiting Israel. More outrageously, he tried to garner votes by ordering a major military operation in Gaza on the eve of the election \u2014 an operation his military chiefs and attorney general scotched.\n\nNone of it worked. Israeli voters recoiled at the shameless pandering, the ignoble kowtowing, the self-serving recklessness. In an age of demagogues, Israelis showed that demagogy doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThen there\u2019s the success of Blue and White, which proves there\u2019s a future for democratic centrism after all.\n\nGantz is a neophyte politician with the quiet charisma that comes with inner composure; the quality \u2014 so rare in modern politics \u2014 of not being perpetually frantic. He projects confidence without fanaticism. The far-right detests him because he appreciates the long-term necessity of separating from the Palestinians. The far-left dislikes him because he\u2019s under no illusions about Israel\u2019s enemies and understands the necessity of possessing and, when necessary, using force.\n\nHe seeks stable balances, not permanent solutions. He\u2019s sane.\n\nFinally, there is the breadth and vitality of Israeli democracy. In 2015, Netanyahu infamously warned that Israeli-Arabs were voting \u201cin droves.\u201d In 2019, Israeli-Arabs proved him right with a turnout of around 60 percent. Ultra-Orthodox turnout was also very high \u2014 but, significantly, an ultra-Orthodox woman, Omer Yankelevich, was re-elected on the Blue and White list.", "description": "In an age of demagogues, Israelis showed that demagogy doesn\u2019t work.", "authors": ["Bret Stephens"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/20/opinion/20stephensWeb/20stephensWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
