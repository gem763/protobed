With purported ani-inflammatory powers, CBD is being used in everything from sheet masks to hummus.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle website Goop \u2013 known as much for its alternative beauty therapies (Google \u201cjade vagina eggs\u201d), as it is for its foray into luxury wellness \u2013 is littered with cannabis products, from recipes for CBD-spiked cocktails to CBD-infused bath bombs. There\u2019s even a range of cannabis edibles available for the \u201cme-time-starved mum\u201d.\n\nBarneys New York has just opened its first outlet for all things cannabis, The High End, in Beverly Hills.\n\nIt makes perfect sense, then, that two former Goop staffers, Meredith Schroeder and Ashley Lewis, have launched their own CBD apothecary. Fleur March\u00e9 is an online store committed to solving wealthy women\u2019s issues, including hangovers and appetite regulation, with superbly packaged CBD kits, reminiscent of luxury fragrances. They\u2019re quickly becoming known as \u201cthe Sephora of CBD\u201d.\n\nFurther north, CropLogic, an agricultural technology company, is embarking on a 60-hectare \u201ctrial\u201d hemp farm in Oregon, a state already synonymous with cannabis growth. With hemp market projections about $US2.5 billion, CropLogic considers itself well positioned to service the boom.\n\nAnd what a boom it is. Adam Miller, founder of Budding Tech, Australia\u2019s first medical cannabis advisory firm, says the legalisation of the drug in the US has had a domino effect around the world. He calls cannabis a \u201cmarket disrupter\u201d with the potential to take on the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nIn Australia, the medicinal cannabis market is expected to reach $3 billion by 2028.\n\nThe numbers are certainly there: in 2018, the global medical cannabis market was projected to be worth about $55 billion by 2024. But this year, that estimate had to be adjusted to $62.9 billion. Miller calls those projections conservative.\n\nIn Australia, the medicinal cannabis market is valued at about $18 million annually, despite the drug being difficult to procure. Still, it\u2019s expected to reach $3 billion by 2028, says Miller, who compares the trend to the dotcom bubble and the more recent cryptocurrency craze.\n\nFor former advertising tech chief executive Drew Todd and his partners, Alex Iwanchuk and Eric Scheibling, the comparison is an apt one. Using the skills they formed while working in the online space, the self-identifying \u201cdata-driven nerds\u201d have launched Feals.com, a direct-to-door e-commerce site, selling CBD kits and tinctures in differing strengths with the aim of curing everything from nausea to flight nerves. The website, which looks like the love child of Apple and a day spa, launched in late March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Australia might be lagging, Miller remains positive. He predicts the industry will continue to grow, in spite of current legislation, which stipulates that cannabis use is only accessible in Australia via the special access scheme, created for unregistered medicines.\n\n\u201cThe bottleneck really exists at the prescribing level, so what we\u2019re seeing now are a number of cannabis clinics opening up around Australia,\u201d says Miller. \u201cWhat these companies are doing is creating specialised hubs for dedicated doctors who are medical cannabis experts, so they can properly track the patient\u2019s process and comply with the TGA [Therapeutic Goods Administration].\u201d\n\nDespite the obstacles, demand is flourishing. In 2017, there were 158 approved medicinal cannabis patients in Australia. By January 2019, there were 2800.\n\nA worker inspects legal cannabis plants growing in Quebec, Canada. Chris Roussakis/Bloomberg\n\nTHC Global, a leading medicinal cannabis company, is developing an Australian cannabis facility in northern NSW, with the aim of producing 50,000 kilograms of dried cannabis flower. The company, which operates under a farm-to-pharma model, is already supplying medicinal cannabis products to Australian patients and acquired another cannabis site in Canada in March. CEO Ken Charteris believes this is a significant step in the company\u2019s global strategy, and estimates the Canadian site will generate upwards of $200 million in revenue.\n\nIt seems wildly optimistic, but according to Miller, a surge \u2013 via Australia\u2019s health and wellness industries \u2013 is only a matter of time. Looking at local pharmaceutical companies, he may be on the money. In November 2018, Chemist Warehouse signed a deal with Bod Australia, a health and wellness company with a focus on cannabis. Bod now has big plans to launch its products in Britain and Europe.\n\nIn January 2019, Australian Pharmaceutical Industries, which owns Priceline, organised a supply contract with cannabis drug developer Medlab Clinical, with the aim of rolling out a range of nutraceuticals (more commonly known as prescription-only dietary supplements and additives).\n\nAnother Australian company, Zelda Therapeutics, just struck up a partnership with Ilera Healthcare, a medicalised marijuana manufacturer and dispensary based in the US, with the aim of developing new medicinal cannabis products.\n\nThe mood might best be likened to the last days of the Roaring Twenties, when prohibition still existed, but only by a whisker.\n\nThe law is one thing; marketing is another challenge. Cannabis companies can\u2019t engage Instagram influencers the way they would with a protein shake or slimming tea, due to various legislation (and general hesitancy surrounding the industry). However, the limited exposure lends these cannabis companies a certain exclusivity, amplified by its clandestine reputation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLegalisation is only two years old in the United States, and it\u2019s not even legal across the country. Which means the mood at the moment might best be likened to the last days of the Roaring Twenties, when prohibition still existed, but only by a whisker, making speakeasies all that more seductive. This is exactly what the present crop of cannabis companies in the US are banking on.\n\nCannabis producers are happy to promote a decrease in anxiety and sleeplessness, but if you also happen to feel like a guest on Gatsby\u2019s lawn every time you partake, so much the better. This might explain why Heineken and Marlboro have recently jumped on the CBD bandwagon.\n\nThe aim, according to business experts, is to take control of the Millennial market, where consumers are more interested in an experience, as opposed to a consumable, take-home product. At wellness spas, for example, CBD is offered as an enhancement, on top of your facial or massage. CBD, after all, contains a plethora of active ingredients set to not only revolutionise the wellness space, but the beauty industry as well.\n\nCannabidiol, or CBD, is already found in a host of beauty and therapeutic products.\n\nApplied topically, CBD has impressive anti-inflammatory properties, as well as vitamins A and E, making it the perfect balm for everything from psoriasis to rosacea, not to mention acne. But according to Miller, there is a lot of room for error \u2013 and bogus claims.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an expert on the beauty industry,\u201d says Miller. \u201cCBD does act as an anti-inflammatory, so it would be excellent for cosmetics. But the right dose? That\u2019s the million-dollar question!\u201d The reality, according to Miller, could be that some cosmetic companies might only be infusing their creams and potions with a homeopathic dose.\n\nStill, he remains hopeful, believing demand for the real deal will drive the snake-oil salesmen out of the CBD market. His optimism must be shared by Est\u00e9e Lauder, owner of alternative cosmetic company Origins, which uses CBD in its products, and L\u2019Or\u00e9al, which is rumoured to be investigating an entrance into the market. And why not? The brand\u2019s former head of global product development, Sam Cheow, just resigned to start his own line of aromatherapy and fragrance oils, which heavily features \u2013 yep, you guessed it \u2013 CBD.\n\nIn fact, every other cosmetic company out there is vying for a cut. Think of CBD as the new goji berry, if a goji berry could help your skin while making you feel healthful, hip and extremely chill at the same time. The magical ingredient is available in oils, creams, shea butter, perfumes and even mascara. Time \u2013 and the market \u2013 will tell if it does the trick.\n\nPeople are coming back to us with mad claims \u2013 it\u2019s improved their sleep, it keeps them calm \u2026 \u2014 Cormac Sheehan, The Cannabis Company\n\nBut back in Australia, while consumers wait for legislation to catch up to demand, many of us are settling for CBD\u2019s smaller sibling \u2013 hemp, which contains less than 0.2 per cent THC and is legal here. Cormac Sheehan, CEO and founder of The Cannabis Company in Melbourne, which sells hemp products, says the nutritional and therapeutic profiles of hemp are unsurpassed, and proudly boasts of its benefits.\n\n\u201cWe were the first in the world to distil hemp gin using cannabis terpenes,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first batch of 300 bottles sold out in three days and since then we\u2019re constantly sprinting to keep up. People are coming back to us with mad claims \u2013 it\u2019s improved their sleep, it keeps them calm, it even cures the symptoms of their fibromyalgia.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an irony to the staunch legislation, given that the Australian market is one of the biggest consumers of recreational cannabis in the world \u2013 according to the National Drug Strategy Survey, 35 per cent of us admit to having used it recreationally at some point. But if there\u2019s one thing Adam Miller is banking on, it\u2019s change.\n\n\u201cThis is a future industry,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re really only hitting the tip of the iceberg.\u201d", "description": "Beauty and fashion brands are hitching a ride on the skyrocketing cannabis bandwagon \u2013 predicted to be worth $63 billion within five years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4218%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/70b195b35d2478bd517d6ce766adde8c7dbba60e", "published_at": "2019-04-23"}
