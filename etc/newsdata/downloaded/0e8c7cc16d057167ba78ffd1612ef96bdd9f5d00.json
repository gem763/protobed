On Thursday, the group officially served its millionth meal in the Bahamas, less than six weeks after WCK set up operations on the islands. Andr\u00e9s was not available for comment about the Nobel.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe chef was expected to land Friday in Puerto Rico, where he would honor a commitment to appear at a culinary event at Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton property that reopened in 2018, about a year after Hurricane Maria ripped through the island. For Andr\u00e9s, it would be a return trip to the place where, in 2017, his life and career would take a dramatic turn in the wake of Maria. Where he would begin the transformation from celebrity chef to first responder to national hero to Nobel Peace Prize nominee.\n\n\n\nUnprepared for what he and his organization faced when they landed in Puerto Rico after Maria knocked out the electricity, the roads and most of the island\u2019s communications, volunteers soon discovered they faced another obstacle: an outdated, bureaucratic, top-down, paramilitary-type model of disaster relief that wasn\u2019t prepared to deal with the magnitude of the crisis. Frustrated by the red tape, the delays and the standard thinking on disaster relief, Andr\u00e9s and his team of volunteer chefs did what kitchens have done for decades: They improvised.\n\nThey activated any space with electricity and running water, whether a church, a restaurant or a food truck. They eventually opened a giant kitchen at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, where they produced 60,000 meals a day. They rewrote the book on how to feed people after a natural disaster. They fed Puerto Ricans \u2014 who are American citizens, Andr\u00e9s frequently pointed out to Trump, who was accused of responding slowly to the unfolding crisis \u2014 millions of hot meals, staying there for months to make sure the job was done.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was also an untold disaster, hidden from view and lied about by our public officials,\u201d Andr\u00e9s wrote in his book, \u201cWe Fed an Island.\u201d \u201cMy mission was to help my fellow American citizens, and to tell their story to a world that was living in the dark.\u201d\n\nPuerto Rico marked a major shift in priorities for both Andr\u00e9s and World Central Kitchen. At the start, WCK was more about building infrastructure, setting up businesses and the developing the skills of people in underdeveloped countries. It could be in Haiti, Honduras or Nicaragua. \u201cWe were helping people become culinary professionals in the hopes of elevating the cities and the countries where they are from,\u201d said Victor Albisu, the chef behind Poca Madre and a founding board member of WCK.\n\nBut following their work in Puerto Rico, Andr\u00e9s and WCK embraced their roles as first responders. They have fed victims of every type of disaster: They deployed to the Venezuelan-Colombian border during the political struggle in Venezuela. They traveled to California after the devastating wildfires. They set up kitchens in Indonesia after the earthquake and tsunami. They even opened a relief kitchen in downtown Washington to feed federal workers during the partial government shutdown this year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cJos\u00e9, in the field, is intense,\u201d said Albisu. \u201cHe\u2019s very focused but all over the place. Meaning that, as soon as something is established, he\u2019s already looking where he can do the next thing. \u2026 He\u2019s never comfortable with the first achievement. There\u2019s always much more to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat leadership is invaluable, that perspective, and it\u2019s just him,\u201d Albisu added. \u201cThat\u2019s not just language and talking. That\u2019s real stuff, because I\u2019ve felt it from him. I\u2019m better off for it.\u201d\n\nWorld Central Kitchen and Andr\u00e9s have become so proficient at disaster relief that they were actually on the ground in the Bahamas before Dorian hit.\n\n\u201cThis pre-positioning was essential as it allowed us to jump into action immediately to deliver meals,\u201d Nate Mook, executive director of WCK, said in a statement to The Washington Post. \u201cWe will continue to serve hot and nutritious meals as long as we are needed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the process, WCK has grown from a small organization, with total assets of $119,000 in 2016, to one with total assets of $16.3 million in 2018, according to the organization\u2019s financials.\n\nAndr\u00e9s may not have won the Nobel Peace Prize, but he has won the hearts and influenced the minds of countless people, including industry peers who have seen his work up close.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a world that continually tells us the that the impossible is improbable, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s reminds us that a few people, and a \u2018no quit\u2019 attitude can change the future of people in hardship,\u201d chef and television personality Andrew Zimmern said in an email to The Post.\n\n\u201cI am so proud of my friend and his amazing organization,\u201d Zimmern continued. \u201cOn a personal level if it wasn\u2019t for a long night spent hashing out the issues of the world with Jos\u00e9 over 10 years ago, I wouldn\u2019t be doing the service work that gives me the greatest joy in my life. He set my life on its current course, and he has done the same for millions of people around the world.\u201d\n\nRead more on Food:\n\nAD", "description": "The celebrity-chef-turned-humanitarian was serving meals in the Bahamas in the days before the Nobel announcement.", "authors": ["Tim Carman", "Reporter Focusing On National Food Issues", "Critic Covering Affordable", "Under-The-Radar Restaurants In The D.C.
