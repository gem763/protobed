Rosengren speaks in New York, April 17, 2013. REUTERS/Keith Bedford/Files\n\nWould the same strategies apply in Smith County, Kansas, where the population has been declining since 1900 and now includes twice the proportion of senior citizens as the United States as a whole?\n\nThat\u2019s the dilemma economists have begun wrestling with as they debate whether \u201cplace based\u201d economic strategies, often seen as a path to pork barrel spending under the good intent of creating local jobs, may now be the only way to reverse the separation of the country into areas that are doing well and those that are treading water or slipping behind.\n\nThe short answer: It won\u2019t be easy, and after decades of decline in some places it may require a fairly tough set of decisions about which ones have a credible chance to rebound.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do this for every community,\u201d Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren said after a two-day conference the bank sponsored here on the geographic divisions that have split the United States into largely coastal boomtowns that are increasing their share of national jobs and wealth, and evidence of stagnation in many other places.\n\n\u201cNot every community has social cohesion. Not every community has a good leader,\u201d Rosengren said as he outlined the qualities the Boston Fed used in a competition to select towns for economic development grants, one of which helped Lawrence move 200 working parents into new or better jobs, and set up a system for more to follow.\n\n\u201cWe were looking for communities that had the highest probability of success,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is not a new idea that geography shapes a country\u2019s economy. Natural features such as rivers and the Great Lakes helped the U.S. industrial heartland thrive in its heyday. But until recently \u201cplace\u201d was not seen as a constraint on individual success: if jobs and opportunity were inadequate in one town, it was assumed people would move, providing a built-in source of adjustment across the American economy.\n\nA growing body of research, however, shows that is no longer the case. People are moving less, incomes across regions are no longer growing closer, and the opportunities in the \u201csuperstar\u201d places may be growing out of reach for the less educated. Places that lag in job growth are less likely to catch up; kids born in poor neighborhoods are more likely to be poor as adults.\n\nWhile chronic joblessness is a well-recognized problem in ailing cities such as Baltimore and Cleveland, and in some of the country\u2019s remote rural corners, the election of Donald Trump in 2016 focussed attention on the fact that it existed across a broad swath of small town America \u2014 and was hardening attitudes among parts of the white working class. The unemployment rate among job seekers may be low, but larger numbers of working age men in particular have simply stopped looking for work at all.\n\n\u201cThere is a plausible view that in the long run all local low skilled employment will be in services,\u201d said Edward Glaeser, a Harvard University economics professor. New technologies such as ridesharing platforms \u201cwill be able to generate jobs for less skilled people in Boston. What are they going to do in eastern Tennessee? That seems the central question...for American employment policy in the 21st century.\u201d\n\n\u2018THERE IS A PROBLEM\u2019\n\nOver two days of discussion there was no clear answer.\n\nTrump\u2019s election drew attention to the problems of working age men displaced from blue collar jobs. But should they be encouraged to move, retrain as computer coders, or make what may require a cultural leap and join the boom in jobs caring for the elderly?\n\nWhat about a separate suite of longer standing issues, such as the state of urban school systems still lagging under the legacy of segregation? Beyond Medicaid, food stamps and other programs that funnel tax dollars to individuals, should national policy be used more aggressively to subsidise education, services or jobs in low income areas?\n\n\u201cThere is strong consensus there is a problem...We don\u2019t know quite what to do about it,\u201d said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology labour economist whose research on the \u201cChina shock\u201d helped frame debate about the disproportionate impact China\u2019s rise had on U.S. manufacturing hubs.\n\nSome large national efforts have been proposed or are already underway.\n\nTrump\u2019s trade battles with China are, ostensibly, about reversing some of the decline, but with no evidence yet that the potential benefits will outweigh the risks. The 2017 tax bill included capital gains tax exemptions for investments in ailing census tracts. That programme is still in its early stages.\n\nOne proposal for the federal government to fund research and development hubs in dozens of mid-size cities might help places with an existing core of college graduates. It may not help those with a less educated workforce, typically the worst off.\n\n\u201cWe are not dealing with one problem\u201d but several connected ones, said Betsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan economics professor and a former member of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nFor Rosengren, that may mean acknowledging the geographic divide as a generational problem, half a century in the making and with roots in the shift toward services and knowledge-based industries that has accelerated since the 1980s.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just want to throw money evenly across the country and see what sticks,\u201d Rosengren said, arguing that any effort should be \u201cmostly ground up and more of a competition\u201d so local communities can be in charge of their own best ideas.\n\n\u201cWe have had 50 years of many of these communities not doing well. It is not like you turn it on a dime.\u201d", "description": "Boston Federal Reserve officials have a pretty good idea what helped the ailing industrial town of Lawrence, Massachusetts, start to make a turnaround, including a state takeover of the public school system and a focussed effort to lift job options for working parents.", "authors": ["Howard Schneider", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437925611&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF96051", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
