Earlier this year, Netflix (NFLX) raised the price of its basic plan by $1 and the standard plan that features HD streaming on two devices by $2. The premium Netflix plan also went up $2.\n\nWhile the price hike helped to nicely lift average revenue per user in the U.S. (+16.5%) and internationally (+10%) in the third quarter, it appears that a large subsection of consumers have balked \u2014 possibly canceling their subscriptions.\n\n\u201cSince our U.S. price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower U.S. membership growth,\u201d Netflix called out in its shareholder\u2019s letter Wednesday. Exerting pricing power is critical for Netflix given the outsized investments it\u2019s making to develop original content and to keep the outside content it has on its platform.\n\nSeeing what may be limited pricing power for Netflix is a red flag ahead of competing offerings from Disney (DIS) and Apple (AAPL) arriving shortly. It suggests consumers are open to lower cost options to Netflix \u2014 which is obviously not a good look for Netflix, especially as it continues to burn through its free cash flow. Further, it hints that Netflix may have to find a way to offer greater value to subscribers if it wants to push prices higher.\n\nHere come the Netflix rivals. More\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the other worrying sentence, it speaks to the quality of the third quarter \u2014 or lack thereof by Netflix\u2019s historical standards \u2014 that the streaming giant delivered. Netflix beat on Wall Street earnings estimates by a whopping 43 cents, but that looks to have been fueled by clever maneuvers on the expense line.\n\n\u201cOperating margin of 18.7% (up 670 bps year over year) was above our guidance due to timing of content and marketing spend, which will be more weighted to Q4\u201919,\u201d Netflix said in the letter. That suggests Netflix is ready to spend aggressively in marketing and promotions in the final quarter of the year to keep subscribers amid the arrival of competing offerings. With subscriber growth continuing to slow, what may be elevated expenses only raises the downside risk to fourth quarter profits.\n\nCautioned Netflix, \"The launch of these new services will be noisy. There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance. In the long-term, though, we expect we\u2019ll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity.\"\n\nNevertheless, in the early going the market is breathing a sigh of relief Netflix\u2019s third quarter wasn\u2019t as bad as feared \u2014 even though it was another mixed one at best as outlined above. Netflix shares popped 7% in the aftermath of its earnings report, despite the company once again falling short of its U.S. paid net subscriber additions.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
