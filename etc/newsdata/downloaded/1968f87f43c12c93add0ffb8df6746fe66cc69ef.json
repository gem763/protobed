Think again.", "language": "en", "text": "Credit card data is stolen in lots of different ways: phishing, skimmers, malware on e-commerce sites, scam phone calls, dishonest clerks and data breaches, which can affect hundreds of millions of people. (Sofia Varano for The Washington Post)\n\nCheck your bank balance, Avril Rhoades in Valdez, Alaska. Freeze your credit, Nazaryah Minnieweather of Victorville, Calif. And cancel your credit card, Jennifer Kelly in LaGrange, Ga. A gang of thieves was selling your card information on a public Facebook group, and anyone willing to pay as little as $4 for stolen credit card information could use it to buy, say, a $1,499 iPhone and you\u2019d get the bill. (Facebook shut down the group when notified of its existence by The Washington Post.)\n\nWhile microchips in credit cards have sharply reduced fraud in transactions that take place in stores, mobile and online transactions have become the low-hanging fruit of criminal opportunity.\n\n\u201cCard-not-present\u201d credit, debit and prepaid card fraud has ballooned in the United States in the last few years, reaching $4.57 billion in 2016, up 34 percent from the year before, according to the most recentFederal Reserve Payments Study. These shadowy crimes hurt both small businesses and the customer shopping experience.\n\nIf you\u2019ve swiped a credit card at a gas station that has a hidden skimmer, your information was compromised during the Equifax data breach, or you ordered something from a website infected by malware, it is more than likely that thieves have your card information, according to cybersecurity experts, who often find themselves one step behind international criminal networks.\n\n[The spy in your wallet: Credit cards have a privacy problem]\n\n\u201cRecent figures suggest that over 80 percent of credit cards currently in people\u2019s wallets have already been compromised,\u201d said Markus Bergthaler, director of programs and marketing for the nonprofit Merchant Risk Council, which educates businesses on strategies to curtail fraud.\n\nCrooks obtain credit card information by stealing it right from the card or buying it on the massive online marketplace for stolen cards on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube as well as the dark Web, a separate network that can\u2019t be reached with normal browsers.\n\nThey then use the information to impersonate the cardholder and buy nearly anything over the Internet. The goods are delivered to an address here or abroad, and the scammer, who is rarely pursued by law enforcement, lives to steal again another day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident my credit card information is in cyberspace,\u201d said Chris Leone, assistant to the special agent in charge of the Criminal Investigative Division of the Secret Service, the government\u2019s lead agency on financial cybercrime. \u201cThese guys have gotten so good, they have a checkout box to buy stolen credit card numbers just like on a retail website.\u201d\n\nThe cost of card-not-present cybercrime goes far beyond the billions lost in merchandise. Businesses spend heavily to protect against fraud, hiring security experts, buying software and contracting with outside companies to monitor transactions. Banks have to replace stolen credit cards regularly. As the Federal Reserve noted in a report last year, payment fraud \u201crepresents a drag on economic activity.\u201d\n\nAnd the problem has a \u201cmajor effect on the consumer-buying experience,\u201d said Michael Reitblat, CEO of Forter, a fraud prevention company, who estimates that between 5 percent and 10 percent of online orders are declined, sometimes for innocent anomalies. \u201cRetailers are turning away a lot of good orders.\u201d\n\nThe toll on small business\n\nBut these thefts go largely unreported to law enforcement, uninvestigated and unpunished. Most businesses don\u2019t report, in part because it reflects badly on their company. Cardholders don\u2019t report the fraud because banks immediately void bogus charges. So the public is not clamoring for a solution.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what underpins it,\u201d said D.J. Murphy, editor in chief of Card Not Present, an online publication devoted to the topic. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t hurt consumers, there\u2019s no outcry.\u201d\n\n[Help Desk: Ask our tech columnist a question]\n\nWhom does it hurt? Small-business owners.\n\n\u201cIf you shoplift a $10 item from Target, you\u2019re going to get in trouble,\u201d said Wes Pritt, president of Blue Ridge Net Publishing, an online retailer in Roanoke. \u201cThe police will come, and you\u2019ll be charged.\u201d But if his company sends out a $3,000 order paid for with a stolen credit card, no law enforcement agency will try to find the perpetrator. His company will absorb the loss, as well as incur a \u201cchargeback fee\u201d from the credit card processing company.\n\nA business owner who tries to get law enforcement involved rarely succeeds, so most don\u2019t try.\n\nSmall retailers pay the price, said Avivah Litan, senior security analyst at the advisory firm Gartner Inc. \u201cThe large retailers like Amazon have very advanced fraud detection. The small guys don\u2019t have anything. Fraud could easily put them out of business.\u201d\n\nThat risk for small business is a legacy of the early days of e-commerce when banks and credit card companies were unwilling to approve payments over the Internet \u2014 so retailers stepped up. Merchants saw the potential of online sales and accepted the liability \u201cin exchange for being able to tap a new and powerful sales channel,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nBut if the Internet was in its infancy, so was cybercrime.\n\n\u201cThe fraudulent orders were more obvious back then,\u201d said Pritt. \u201cThe billing and shipping addresses were far apart, the IP address of the computer was some place different from both, and the shipping method was typically Next Day Air.\u201d He could spot them easily. \u201cNowadays they\u2019re way more sophisticated.\u201d\n\nThieves route orders through a computer in the same region as the presumed buyer: an order from a Kansas credit card that comes from a Kansas computer won\u2019t trigger a security alert. The owner of the hacked computer in Kansas will never know.\n\nClose to half of attacks on American companies come from the United States, Reitblat said. But some foreign criminals \u2014 experts cited countries in Eastern Europe and West Africa \u2014 now specialize in credit card fraud aimed at American businesses and consumers.\n\n\u201cIn my estimation, there are at least 2 million people and this is what they do for a living \u2014 they steal credit cards from Americans,\u201d said Gary Warner, director of research in computer forensics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\n[Apple Card\u2019s cash-back reward doesn\u2019t impress me. Here\u2019s why.]\n\nOn his computer screen, he scrolled through Web pages showing the names and numbers of credit card holders \u2014 and the answers to their security questions. The pages belonged to the Full House Money Gang, a mainly West African computer crime syndicate with 2,553 members, according to Warner.\n\nAll it takes is high-speed Internet, \u201ca good educational system and no chance in hell of anyone getting a decent-paying job,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw it in Eastern Europe \u2014 they had great universities, they had high-speed Internet, but the economy had crumbled to a point that no one could make a decent living working honestly.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, criminals shifted to credit card theft with the arrival of cell towers. \u201cWhat changed in the last five years? Decent cell service. Now they can sit with their Android phones and open a bank account in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAn 'ecosystem' of fraud\n\nCredit card data is stolen in lots of different ways: phishing, skimmers, malware on e-commerce sites, scam phone calls, dishonest clerks and \u2014 the big one \u2014 data breaches, which can affect hundreds of millions of people.\n\nOver the years, an international \u201cecosystem\u201d of fraud has developed, Reitblat said. One organization specializes in cyberbreaches or phishing attacks, another extracts the credit card data, and yet another sells the information. Each player takes a cut, and the price increases every step of the way. A sale early in the chain may ask one bitcoin (currently about $9,500) for 100,000 credit cards, while the price at the end will be from $5 to $20 per card. Cryptocurrencies make these transactions untraceable.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem facing the Secret Service. Even determining the country that is the source of the breach is confounding. If the scammers are identified, \u201cmany of them are in places where we can\u2019t go out and get them,\u201d said Leone.\n\n[Banking while black: Minority business owners with better credit scores than white counterparts face worse treatment and more scrutiny]\n\nMany cybercriminals \u201cdeliberately target companies in nations that do not have extradition treaties with their own home country,\u201d said Stas Alforov of Gemini Advisory, a fraud intelligence company that works with global financial institutions.\n\nIn the last year and a half, a new kind of malware called Magecart has \u201ctaken off massively,\u201d said Brian Krebs, author of KrebsonSecurity.com. Hackers insert one line of malicious code into retail websites, and that code harvests the payment data, sort of \u201cthe virtual equivalent of skimmers.\u201d And if the malware is implanted in a third-party supplier\u2019s software, it will send data from every company that uses the third-party site.\n\nMuch of the trade in stolen cards takes place on the dark Web. It hides all trace of its users and erases browsing history and cookies.\n\nBut the biggest crooks operate on the regular Web, said Michael Dickson of the Secret Service\u2019s Cyber Intelligence Section. Facebook, according to experts, wipes out thousands of credit card shops every day. In April, Cisco\u2019s Talos Security division uncovered 74 Facebook groups with 385,000 members buying and selling stolen credit card numbers \u201cin every language.\u201d\n\nJaeson Schultz of Talos said Facebook has been \u201cvery responsive,\u201d closing down the groups his company found, but relying on groups to self-police, which is unlikely to happen in criminal enterprises. \u201cThey\u2019re going to keep coming back and back,\u201d he said.\n\nDevon Kearns, a Facebook spokesman, said the company has \u201cdedicated teams\u201d that use \u201ca combination of reports from our community, technology, and human review to enforce our policies. \u2026 Facebook\u2019s Community Standards do not allow the promotion or the sale of illegal goods or services, including stolen credit card data.\u201d Twitter, Instagram and YouTube also said that the sale of stolen credit cards violates their policies and they remove such posts when notified.\n\nWith ever-more-sophisticated methods of stealing credit card data and ever-more-blatant methods of marketing it, it would seem that the best opportunity to catch the crooks would be at the delivery site. Most fraudulently ordered merchandise is sent to brick-and-mortar addresses in the United States.\n\nBut these addresses do not belong to the scammers, and many of the recipients may be unwitting conduits for the stolen goods, perhaps after answering ads to work from home. Some delivery addresses are vacant houses, with a scammer parked outside, waiting for FedEx.\n\n\u201cThey case houses and know exactly when those people go to work,\u201d said Bergthaler. \u201cWhatever the shipping address is, it\u2019s never going to be the actual fraudster. We always have to be reactive because we never know what the next scam is going to be.\u201d\n\n[Security alerts on credit cards work. Just be sure to set them at the lowest amount possible.]\n\nSome of the merchandise eventually is shipped abroad and sold for much higher prices. Some is resold domestically on \u201cpop-up\u201d online stores, at suspiciously low prices; when someone buys the merchandise, the scammer obtains yet another credit card number.\n\nAn asymmetrical battle\n\nAll this results in what Leone calls \u201can asymmetrical criminal environment,\u201d in which the scammers maneuver anonymously in cyberspace and have no constraints.\n\n\u201cThe overseas criminals are sitting in front of a computer educating themselves all day long,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of these criminals in Eastern European countries have gone to school for this and they continue to get training.\u201d Law enforcement, meanwhile, struggles to stay up with the changing technology.\n\nThe Secret Service concentrates on the \u201cmore prolific sites with transnational capability,\u201d Dickson said, but \u201ca lot of countries won\u2019t respond to U.S. law enforcement inquiries.\u201d\n\nEven if investigators identify a suspect, nabbing the perpetrator can take years. Roman Seleznev, a notorious Russian hacker serving a 27-year sentence in federal prison for cybercrime, was finally arrested in 2014 while vacationing in the Maldives.\n\n\u201cInvestigators had to wait for him to get to a country that allows extradition,\u201d said Leone.\n\nSo the Secret Service focuses much of its attention on prevention and education. At its National Computer Forensics Institute in Alabama, law enforcement officers learn how to build computers and conduct computer forensics exams. In a mock courtroom, judges and prosecutors learn about encryption and electronic communications and how this evidence can be used in court. And in 40 cities across the United States, Electronic Crimes Task Forces made up of law enforcement, academics and corporate executives regularly meet to discuss cyber-related crime.\n\nAlso, periodically, the Secret Service partners with local police to search gas stations for skimmers. In November 2018, before the holiday season, they searched 400 gas stations in 16 states and located nearly 200 skimmers. (Gas stations are particularly vulnerable because few use chip technology and they are unstaffed at night.) And the newest skimmers are Bluetooth-enabled; the criminal can just drive by to download the data.\n\n[Equifax promised up to $125 for the hack. Now the FTC says you\u2019ll get \u2018nowhere near\u2019 that amount.]\n\nThe FBI maintains a website, ic3.gov, for victims \u2014 both consumers and merchants \u2014 to report card-not-present fraud. The bureau \u201calways follows up\u201d on complaints, said supervisory special agent Zacharia Baldwin. \u201cThe information is reviewed and disseminated.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean agents visit the physical address. \u201cA lot of these frauds are part of larger frauds, such as human trafficking, sex trafficking, terrorism, mortgage fraud, bank fraud, so it will lead to other investigations,\u201d he said. Just because agents aren\u2019t knocking on doors \u201cdoes not mean we\u2019re not following the address or looking into it.\u201d\n\nWhich is small consolation to victimized merchants. But capitalism has provided them with a weapon. Dozens of companies, several of them cited in this article, sell software and services to detect suspicious charges. Some will reimburse the merchant if an approved credit card turns out to be stolen.\n\nThese services are too expensive for some small businesses, however.\n\nIn search of a solution\n\nWhat\u2019s going to stop card-not-present fraud?\n\nThere\u2019s no \u201cmagic bullet,\u201d said Craig Williams, Cisco\u2019s director of Talos Outreach, who cited \u201ca multilayer defense\u201d of user education and more secure sales system.\n\nLots of companies try to prevent and detect fraud, said Murphy of Card Not Present, \u201cbut there is little coordination among them and they are all doing it for different reasons.\u201d And, he pointed out, no technological solution is foolproof. \u201cIt is an incredibly complex topic in an incredibly complex ecosystem.\u201d\n\nCard-not-present fraud is \u201ca business, a profitable business,\u201d said Chris Reid, Mastercard\u2019s cybersecurity chief for North America, and fighting it is \u201ca little like squeezing a balloon \u2014 if you shut off one vulnerability, they will look for other weak links in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nA variety of tools are available; each merchant has to decide which ones will work best, and sign up for those.\n\n[How to protect yourself from credit card skimmers]\n\n\u201cTokenization\u201d turns credit card numbers into code, so that even if a thief breaches the payment process, the number will not be revealed.\n\nAnother tool is 3Dsecure, a system mandated in some European countries but that met resistance in the United States because it was seen as a \u201cconversion killer\u201d \u2014 customers abandoned their online shopping carts rather than go through extra security steps. A new version, referred to as 2.0, is said to be less cumbersome. Under that system, if a fraudulent charge is allowed to go through, the bank assumes liability for it.\n\nMastercard has high hopes for its \u201cbot detector,\u201d which identifies and turns away programs randomly trying username-password combinations on commercial sites; these attacks have increased greatly in the last year.\n\nBrian Krebs says much fraud could be prevented if e-commerce websites stayed on top of their software. \u201cUsually it\u2019s because they\u2019re running outdated shopping-cart software,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to be updated all the time, because there are vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nSo far there\u2019s \u201cno real one-stop shop,\u201d Murphy said, for a crime that goes \u201cbasically unopposed.\u201d\n\nAll in all, the cybersecurity community has a matter-of-fact attitude about the constantly evolving threat. The thieves are motivated to come up with new schemes because \u201cthey have to feed their families too,\u201d said Bergthaler. None of the experts interviewed for this story thought their jobs would be redundant any time soon.\n\nIn the view of Avivah Litan of Gartner Inc., at least some of the burden should lie with Visa and Mastercard, which together hold the lion\u2019s share of the credit card market; if they were held responsible, they could use their \u201csubstantial consolidated market power to fix the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a technology problem,\u201d said Wes Pritt, the online retailer. \u201cIf all of these entities came together, they could find a way to reduce it. Nobody wants to own this.\u201d", "description": "There\u2019s a roaring trade in stolen credit cards on major platforms as well as the dark Web.
