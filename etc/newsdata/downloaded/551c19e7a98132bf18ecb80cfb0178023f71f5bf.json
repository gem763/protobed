Emilio Naranjo/Pool via REUTERS\n\nThe Socialist Party that is currently in power had long sought to remove Franco\u2019s bones from the Valley of the Fallen. The huge monument was built on Franco\u2019s orders and contains the remains of combatants from both sides of the 1936-39 civil war that he unleashed.\n\nFranco\u2019s nationalist legacy still divides Spain and its political parties. Following are reactions to Thursday\u2019s transfer, which an El Mundo opinion poll this month showed 43% of Spaniards favoured and 32.5% opposed.\n\nActing Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez:\n\n\u201cModern Spain is the product of forgiveness, but it can\u2019t be the product of forgetfulness.\n\n...A public tribute to a dictator was more than an anachronism. It was an affront to our democracy. Ending it was an obligation for the generations that did not grow up with the trauma of the civil war and dictatorship.\u201d\n\nCarmen Calvo, acting Deputy Prime Minister:\n\n\u201cThe exhumation of Franco\u2019s remains should make us reflect on what it means for our country\u2019s own image and for democracy. Young people should understand that we can never again be without democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are the country with the second-highest number of disappeared people and that is unacceptable in a full democracy like ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn due course, the Valley of the Fallen will be a monument to honour, to the memory of the people who are there, and finally to justice for everyone, for both sides.\u201d\n\nConservative PP party leader Pablo Casado:\n\n\u201cThe past stays in the past... On (election day) November 10, we won\u2019t vote on our past (but)... on our future.\u201d\n\nPablo Iglesias, leader of left-wing party Unidas Podemos:\n\n\u201cToday, no party has the right to talk about victory or to take credit. No justice has yet been done for (Franco\u2019s) victims. Today is the day to thank the associations of victims and the remembrance groups that have pushed and will continue to push for dignity and justice.\u201d\n\nAlbert Rivera, leader of centre-right party Ciudadanos:\n\n\u201cSixty-five percent of Spaniards... did not live and suffer under Franco. The historic day was the day the (post-Franco) constitution was approved.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bones of a dictator who died 44 years ago should not be a government\u2019s priority in my opinion. The only silver lining is that Pedro Sanchez will stop talking about Franco\u2019s bones.\u201d\n\nSantiago Abascal, leader of the far-right Vox party:\n\n\u201cSanchez goes beyond junk TV with this electoral and corpse- scavenging show... The dead are respected, whether they are called Franco or (leftist icon) Pasionaria.\u201d\n\nFranco\u2019s oldest grandson, Francisco Franco y Martinez Bordiu:\n\n\u201cI feel a great deal of rage because they have used something as cowardly as digging up a corpse, using a body as propaganda and political publicity, to win a handful of votes before an election.\u201d\n\nOnlookers in the cemetery where the remains are due to be reburied:\n\nJorge Alvarez, 24:\n\n\u201cI think what the government is trying to do is outrageous. I am here to protest and to prove that a quite big proportion of Spaniards are against what the government is trying to do.\u201d\n\nMaite Garcia, student, 16:\n\n\u201cThey should not have moved him, because he died 44 years ago and if he\u2019s there he\u2019s not bothering anyone. If they bring him here, I don\u2019t care but obviously I think he did bad things, very bad things, but also good things... It\u2019s time to leave things alone. He\u2019s dead, no matter what he did.\u201d\n\nGuillermo Barra, student, 16:\n\n\u201cI visited a year and a bit ago with my grandparents, to see Franco\u2019s tomb before it disappeared... Seeing the tomb filled me with respect and it made me think that this man did a lot of things, rather bad things, and to see him there so human... makes you think.\u201d\n\nIan Gibson, historian and expert in Spanish Civil War and Franco:\n\n\u201cFranco has been an ogre in a disgusting mausoleum. Today is the day of liberation.\u201d\n\nBaltasar Garzon, former judge who tried to open an inquiry into Franco\u2019s crimes:\n\n\u201cToday a historic barbarity comes to an end.\u201d\n\nEmilio Silva, chairman of the Association of Historical Memory, the main national organisation campaigning for Franco\u2019s victims:\n\n\u201cThe removal of the body of the dictator from the Valley of the Fallen marks the first time that General Franco\u2019s biographical and symbolic journey ... is forced to obey an order from a democratic society, after 80 years of uprising.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 1,500 kg gravestone that crowns his tomb is like the plug in a drain that can flush out the enormous number of structures and infrastructures that have survived throughout these 40 years of post-Franco political culture.\u201d", "description": "Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco's remains were exhumed on Thursday from a state mausoleum outside Madrid where they had lain since his death in 1975, for reburial in a private family vault.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444527329&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0Y7", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
