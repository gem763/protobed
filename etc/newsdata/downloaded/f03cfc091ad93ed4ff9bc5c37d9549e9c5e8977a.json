Only four were euthanized due to human-bear conflicts.\n\nShe says the public cares about what happens to orphaned and injured cubs.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Idaho Mountain Express, http://www.mtexpress.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Questions are being raised after an Idaho Department of Fish and Game officer killed an orphaned black bear cub in Hailey last week rather than send it to a rehabilitation facility.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
