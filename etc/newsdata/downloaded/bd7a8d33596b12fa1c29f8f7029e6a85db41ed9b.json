I would say, All I can say is when Flix says \u2018I love you,\u2019 Orca says \u2018I know.'\u201d\n\nHowever, some fans still complain that the series does not qualify as pro-LGBTQ because the characters are aliens, not humans. The leftist bloggers at sci-fi site Gizmodo, for instance, accused Star Wars Resistance of perpetrating a \u201chalf measure\u201d for gay representation.\n\n\u201cIn a universe where humans exist, it\u2019s certainly welcome to see queer representation, but this couple\u2019s not humanoid (like, say, Finn and Poe) so it feels like a bit of a half-measure,\u201d Gizmodo said.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "The producers of Disney's animated series\u00a0\"Star Wars Resistance\"\u00a0have revealed that the show has featured an \"absolutely gay couple\" from the very beginning.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/starwarsresistance1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
