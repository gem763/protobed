Beautiful,' which caught the attention of Sampaio on Tuesday.\n\nFeud: The Good Place star Jameela Jamil sent out a seemingly innocuous tweet about a runway show that sparked a war of words with model Sara Sampaio\n\nJamil's tweet: Jamil, a former model agent herself, tweeted, 'Oh my god This looks like the most fun, and not a long-starved terrified teenager in sight. Beautiful,' which caught the attention of Sampaio on Tuesday\n\nThe 28 year old Sampaio, a Victoria's Secret Angel who became the first Portuguese model to be featured in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, clapped back at Jamil.\n\n'How about celebrating someone without bringing other people down?' Sampaio said in a quote-retweet of Jamil's retweet.\n\n'Calling runway models \"long-starved terrified teenager\" is extremely offensive. From someone that is always preaching for body positivity this just screams hypocrisy,' Sampaio concluded.\n\nClap back: The 28 year old Sampaio, a Victoria's Secret Angel who became the first Portuguese model to be featured in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, clapped back at Jamil\n\nJamil responded minutes later, clarifying she wasn't referring to every model in her original tweet.\n\n'I didn\u2019t say all models in my tweet so try to calm down. But I will say there is a *vast* majority issue with young girls starving themselves, and using drugs and cocaine to control their weight, to meet the very small sample sizes. If you don\u2019t see that, then you are in a bubble,' Jamil said.\n\nShe added in another tweet, 'I also don\u2019t preach \u201cbody positivity.\u201d I talk about moving away from all talk of body, in order to combat our current pervasive issue of eating disorder culture, which is in NO small way perpetuated by the extreme thinness demanded of girls by the high fashion powers that be.'\n\nClarify: Jamil responded minutes later, clarifying she wasn't referring to every model in her original tweet\n\nChill: 'I didn\u2019t say all models in my tweet so try to calm down.

If you don\u2019t see that, then you are in a bubble,' Jamil said\n\nBody positivity: She added in another tweet, 'I also don\u2019t preach \u201cbody positivity.\u201d I talk about moving away from all talk of body, in order to combat our current pervasive issue of eating disorder culture, which is in NO small way perpetuated by the extreme thinness demanded of girls by the high fashion powers that be'\n\nSampaio responded by stating that Jamil still shouldn't have felt the need to, 'attack girls just so you can celebrate others.'\n\n'Eating disorders, drugs and cocaine use aren\u2019t a exclusive problem of models, it\u2019s a huge problem is society as a whole,' Sampaio added.\n\n'And when you talk like you know for sure majority of (models) have eating disorders and drug problems, when that\u2019s not the case. And about modeling I can for sure talk with more certainty than you. Sure that happens but it\u2019s for sure not a vast majority. The point of my tweet though, wasn\u2019t that one! And you know!' Sampaio added.\n\nNo attack: Sampaio responded by stating that Jamil still shouldn't have felt the need to, 'attack girls just so you can celebrate others'\n\nJamil retorted that she, 'was a model, and a model agent and a lot of my friends are still models and agents. Who are all struggling with ongoing unrealistic standards of this industry you benefit from, which is why you are fiercely defending it, and asking me not to call out its devastating wrongs.'\n\n'Sara, respectfully, I don\u2019t think this is the hill to die on. This industry is unlike other industries in that it makes professionals out of children, and informs culture and society, and is a standard set for young people everywhere. Fashion is a dangerous industry for too many,' Jamil added.\n\nSampaio added, 'How is saying to not deminish other people to celebrate others negative for girls? Cause that was the point of my tweet! Period! I never said there wasn\u2019t a problem with the industry, so don\u2019t go around and put words in my mouth! Be better than that!'\n\nJamil retorted by telling her, 'Don\u2019t police how I choose to celebrate something or call out something problematic. I was celebrating that it\u2019s a refreshing change, compared to the toxic fashion show norm. I\u2019m an activist. My words aren\u2019t cute, or easy, or inoffensive. Change doesn\u2019t come from being polite.'\n\nIn a separate tweet to another fan, Sampaio said, 'I said what I had to say. She\u2019s not willing to listen nor trying to understand other people\u2019s opinions... I stand by what I said! You never need to bash other people to celebrate others! No matter what.'\n\nRetort: Jamil retorted that she, 'was a model, and a model agent and a lot of my friends are still models and agents. Who are all struggling with ongoing unrealistic standards of this industry you benefit from, which is why you are fiercely defending it, and asking me not to call out its devastating wrongs'\n\nNo hill: Sampaio added, 'How is saying to not deminish other people to celebrate others negative for girls?
