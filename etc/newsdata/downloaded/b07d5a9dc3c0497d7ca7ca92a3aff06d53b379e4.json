The iPhone 11 is replacing 2018\u2019s cheaper iPhone model, the iPhone XR.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nApple\u2019s newest flagship iPhone, the iPhone 11, was announced on Tuesday, along with its beefier siblings, the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max.\n\nLike so many iPhone models before it, the iPhone 11 has a more powerful chip at its core and better cameras than last year\u2019s model. It\u2019s the same iPhone you know and love, but slightly better than the previous one.\n\nThere\u2019s one huge difference between 2018\u2019s iPhone XS and 2019\u2019s iPhone 11: $300.\n\ncaption The iPhone 11 comes in six colors, just like the iPhone XR. source Apple\n\nThat\u2019s right: The new iPhone 11 costs $700, which represents a major price cut from the $1,000 iPhone XS. We\u2019re talking about 300 big ones! That\u2019s a lot of cash!\n\nBut it\u2019s not the right comparison. The iPhone 11 is actually a replacement for last year\u2019s \u201cbudget\u201d iPhone, the iPhone XR, which cost $750 when it launched alongside the $1,000 iPhone XS.\n\nRead more: These are Apple\u2019s new iPhones: the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max\n\nIn reality, the $700 iPhone 11 has a much smaller cut than it appears: just $50.\n\nIt\u2019s a trick of marketing: The name \u201ciPhone 11\u201d makes it sound as if it\u2019s the new flagship, but it isn\u2019t.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro is the new flagship, and it costs the same $1,000 as last year\u2019s flagship iPhone XS.\n\nHere\u2019s the 2019 iPhone lineup, with the \u201cbudget\u201d phone on the left, at $700, and the flagship Pro models in the center and on the right:\n\ncaption Don\u2019t be tricked: The iPhone 11 is the \u201cbudget\u201d iPhone option in 2019. source Apple\n\nIf you look closely at the specs of the iPhone XR and the specs of the iPhone 11, you\u2019ll quickly realize that the iPhone 11 is the successor to last year\u2019s budget iPhone.\n\nFor starters, they have the same type of screen (\u201cLiquid Retina HD\u201d), and it\u2019s the same size (6.1 inches). The iPhone 11 camera has two sensors, compared with the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s three; the iPhone XR featured a single camera sensor compared with the iPhone XS\u2019s dual-sensor setup.\n\nAnd then there are the build materials: The iPhone 11 is made of glass and aluminum, just as the iPhone XR was, while the iPhone 11 Pro is made of stainless steel, just as the iPhone XS was.\n\nNotably, there is no new version of the iPhone XR \u2013 and that\u2019s because the iPhone 11 is exactly that, albeit without the \u201cbudget\u201d branding the iPhone XR carried. It\u2019s a brilliant move for Apple that repositions its budget phone as its flagship.\n\nBut make no mistake: If you buy the iPhone 11, you\u2019re getting the \u201cbudget\u201d iPhone of 2019.\n\nNow tell us what you think!", "description": "Business Insider - It might sound as if the new iPhone 11 is a big discount compared with the iPhone XS \u2014 but the real comparison is the iPhone XR..
