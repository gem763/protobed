England were \u201ctoo sloppy\u201d, they \u201cneed to improve\u201d, have to \u201cnullify the mistakes\u201d and must do better in their \u201cgame management\u201d.\n\nDefeat to the Czech Republic in Friday\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifer in Prague does not jeopardise England\u2019s qualification for next summer\u2019s tournament \u2013 although it may affect their seeding - but it was a reality check. A worrying sign, also, of how far they still have to go.\n\nWith 23 caps Maguire is now one of England\u2019s senior players and he did not disagree that, maybe, a lack of confidence is affecting some of the defenders. \u201cWe bring our club football into international level,\u201d he said and that applies to him, at the heart of a struggling Manchester United team who are down in 12th place in the Premier League, his central defensive partner on the night, Michael Keane, with Everton dropping into the bottom three and with Danny Rose at Tottenham Hotspur who have their own problems.\n\nOnly right-back Kieran Trippier could be said to be in form since his move to Atletico Madrid in the summer but it was not so long ago that he was out of Gareth Southgate\u2019s plans after a disappointing post-World Cup campaign with Tottenham.\n\nSouthgate himself said that confidence does appear to be a factor although England have also changed their defensive combinations regularly \u2013 partly due to injury \u2013 since reaching the semi-finals in Russia last year, where they had been settled.", "description": "It was a sober assessment from Harry Maguire.", "authors": ["Jason Burt", "Chief Football Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212778449-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqe8EOArUxzcOfIfa2qlTi9amEV5tirMRwJ3l2-PBnFBE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
