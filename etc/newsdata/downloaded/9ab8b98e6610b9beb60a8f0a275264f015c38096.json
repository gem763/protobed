I don't suppose we would have expected anything else. Many of his staff also did the same,\" Charles said.\n\nTrump \"was quite respondent\", she said.\n\nAt end of their meeting \"I asked him again, I said, 'If it was your 19-year-old son, or your son no matter what age, you would be doing the same as me.' And he was holding my hand at the time and he said, 'Yes, I would' and he said 'Maybe we'll try and push this from a different angle',\" Charles said.\n\nDunn said the president \"was very gracious and spoke very well to us\".\n\n\"He was understanding and I think he genuinely will look to try to resolve this in a way to help us,\" he said.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said Sacoolas should return to Britain, saying: \"I do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose.\"\n\nBut a Washington Post photograph of briefing notes held by Trump in an October 9 news event indicated that \"the spouse of the US Government employee will not return to the United Kingdom\".\n\n\"We still want justice for Harry and we will take it as far as we possibly can to ensure that's done,\" Charles said.", "description": "US president meets parents, dropping 'bombshell' that woman responsible for death of their son was in the building.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/b848889753cf4572a7483df7d2a83b88_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
