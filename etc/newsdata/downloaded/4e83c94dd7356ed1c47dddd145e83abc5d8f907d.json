The S&P 500 technology index .SPLRCT ended down 0.7%.\n\nAmong gainers, energy stocks .SPNY rose along with oil prices.\n\nAmong other stocks, AT&T Inc (T.N) gained 1.5% after shareholder Elliott Management Corp disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in the company and pushed for changes.\n\nBoeing Co (BA.N) fell 1.2% after it suspended load testing of its new widebody 777X aircraft over the weekend as media reports said a cargo door failed in a ground stress test.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.49-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.51-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 5, 2019.
