Just 20 per cent comes from non-interest income, meaning maintaining profitability is now more heavily dependent on income coming from net interest. Only 12 per cent of revenue comes from bank fees, down from 29 per cent in 2004.\n\nWhy have we observed this change in revenue composition?\n\nA key factor was the politically-led assault on bank fees and charges that has been underway for two decades.\n\nThe story of bank fees starts in the early 1990s recession when several state-owned banks failed and Westpac and ANZ reported huge losses. Banks needed a strategy to recapitalise.\n\nThe pressure became acute when Aussie Home Loans entered the mortgage market in 1992 and pressured home loan margins.\n\nFrom then on, retail banks started requiring personal and business customers to pay for transaction accounts and other services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA typical account back then would impose a monthly account fee, $10 a month was common, and even charge for individual transactions if the customer exceeded the monthly limit, say 20 transactions.\n\nBanks appeared to have found a new golden goose, but it turned out to be not so golden.\n\nThe community backlash against these fees was virulent. Politicians and consumer interest groups roundly criticised banks at every opportunity, ordered inquiries and demanded some relief. Regulators had no power to intervene in retail pricing, nor did they seek that power.\n\nAt the private urging of politicians, the banks launched ''education campaigns\" every few months to make customers understand why fees were charged and the value of services provided. But no one listened.\n\nIn 2002, the Australian Bankers\u2019 Association took a proposal to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to allow its member banks to agree on some basic features of an account for low-income Australians. A key purpose was to assuage public criticism.\n\nNothing worked and the banks capitulated and started to unwind their dependence on fees and charges. It became easier to recover operating costs in the interest margin, particularly given the household credit boom through the early-to-mid 2000s.\n\nWhen the GFC hit in 2008, new challenges emerged. All banks were desperate for stable sources of funding, basically deposits. Once again this stacked on pressure to remove fees, and even pay higher interest rates.\n\nThe Hayne Royal Commission was a further manifestation in the long-running war against bank fees and commissions. It is interesting to reflect that the commission made no investigations of bank interest rates or margins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts work focused on the so-called ''fees for no service\" scandals.\n\nIronically, an equally valid inquiry focus could have been on the \"service for no fee scandal\" \u2013 the situation of widespread cross-subsidy of services that characterises the banking industry.\n\nThe reality is that many customers pay too little, and many pay too much. It is simple to read the royal commission as uncovering examples of banks ripping off customers, yet there are many more stories of consumers getting services for no payment. To policy advisers, that should also be viewed as a scandal.\n\nThose that use credit cards to pay bills and fully pay their balance each month are being subsidised by other bank customers.\n\nThose that use transaction accounts (pretty much all of us) will typically pay no fees on those accounts, yet have access to mobile apps, ATMs, branches, internet, EFTPOS, phone banking, cheque books, etc.\n\nIt is estimated that it costs a bank more than $5 to process one cheque payment, yet those transactions have been subsidised for decades. Bank-owned ATMs are now totally fee free for any debit or credit card user.\n\nSomeone has to pay for these services. There is no free lunch.\n\nAs fee revenue has subsidised services across the industry, the banks have grown ever more dependent on net interest income. Net interest is the only game in town. This is why they have little choice other than to retain some of the RBA rate cuts.\n\nAnd the politicians and consumer interest groups now complaining should reflect on the role their professions played in bringing it about.", "description": "A two-decade war on bank fees means banks now depend on net interest income more than ever.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2163%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f15a875c5330eaa019f5671f8342ed62ad93f35f", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
