No water, no electricity and no phone lines.\n\nIn this part of the Bahamas, nearly everything is gone.\n\nHurricane Dorian didn\u2019t just upend life in Marsh Harbour, the biggest town in the Abaco Islands. Dorian crushed it, stripping all essentials, schedules and routines \u2014 everything residents and visitors had taken for granted.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no sense when those things might be restored.\n\nFive days after the storm struck the northern end of the Bahamas, the total death toll remains unknown, but fears abound that it will be far higher than the 43 confirmed as of Friday. Many people were still missing. By some estimates Dorian did at least $7 billion in damage.\n\nTens of thousands of traumatized survivors, with nothing but wreckage encircling them and no way to communicate, do not even know where to begin. In the Abacos, they simply had to start by leaving.", "description": "\u201cThis ain\u2019t no place for anyone at the moment,\u201d said one resident of devastated Abaco Island in the Bahamas.", "authors": ["Kirk Semple"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/06/world/06bahamas-1/06bahamas-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
