Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\nThe account does offer comprehensive mobile phone and gadget cover worth around \u00a3190 a year, but there is no travel insurance or car breakdown cover. With an annual fee of \u00a3174, this would only save customers \u00a316 a year.\n\nAnd, as with all these packages, the benefits are only worth it if the customer actually uses it. Many packaged account holders simply forget they have the extras and buy them again.\n\nNatWest/RBS\u2019s Reward Silver account was rated the second worst packaged account, albeit with a considerably better score of 46 per cent. It has no car breakdown cover and only offers limited travel and mobile phone insurance cover. However, it offers discounted cinema tickets and a free restaurant discount card instead of comprehensive insurance cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Nationwide\u2019s FlexPlus account came top of the board. As well as worldwide travel insurance with winter sports covered as standard, the account offers customers comprehensive car breakdown and mobile cover.\n\nAltogether, these benefits are worth more than \u00a3300, which could save customers \u00a3180 a year once fees are deducted.\n\nDespite being \u00a318 cheaper than the Barclays Tech Pack, Nationwide\u2019s FlexPlus account is far more generous, offering a greater variety of insurance benefits.\n\nFirst Direct\u2019s First Directory account finished in second place, with insurance cover worth more than \u00a3300 that could save customers \u00a3156 a year after fees.\n\nCost and quality\n\nFinishing third from the bottom won\u2019t stop TSB increasing the monthly fees on its Silver and Platinum accounts by up to \u00a33 in September without any improvement to benefits for customers. Likewise, Halifax\u2019s Ultimate Reward account, which finished mid-table, also recently bumped up its monthly fee without introducing any additional benefits.\n\nNor is it just the old-school high street banks fleecing the consumer. Monzo Plus, currently being rolled out with more benefits to be announced, costs users \u00a36 a month for an exclusive card and access to events but offers no insurance cover. Users can pay an extra \u00a34 a month for family worldwide travel insurance cover from Axa, bringing the annual cost to \u00a3120.\n\nN26\u2019s Metal account costs a hefty \u00a314.90 a month, yet only offered substandard travel insurance for adults under 66, a stainless steel debit card and \u201cpartner offerings\u201d, such as a free desk once a month at any WeWork location.\n\nAny business selling insurance products in the UK have to comply with a raft of legally binding suitability checks designed to protect consumers. Customers need to be eligible to be able to make a claim if necessary for example. And they need to be kept up to date with that eligibility with a statement every year.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the policies sold through these providers are any good.\n\nJenny Ross, Which? money editor, said: \u201cPackaged accounts can offer a cheaper and more convenient way for people to get insurance, however our analysis shows that not all are created equal. Some offer lower quality cover and limited value for money.\n\n\u201cCustomers should scrutinise the fees and benefits of packaged accounts before signing up \u2013 they\u2019ll only save you money if you make use of the benefits.\u201d\n\nAnd yet all the evidence suggests those people with packaged accounts costing them a fortune for benefits they may not use aren\u2019t likely to switch anytime soon, and the providers know it. There\u2019s precious incentive to change the deals on these extremely lucrative products.\n\nEven if current account holders do switch, they stick with the familiar faces.\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent Minds\n\n\u201cThis stands in contrast, for example, to the energy market where over time households have become more comfortable choosing challenger brands,\u201d says John Crossley, director of money, at comparethemarket.com. \u201cDespite the number of innovative digital banks entering the market, the top providers which switchers choose are Nationwide, HSBC and Natwest \u2013 although Monzo and Starling Bank are hot on their heels.\n\n\u201cThe problem people continue to face is that there is very little difference between current accounts \u2013 and this lack of competition disincentivises switching. In a country of around 70 million current accounts, there are just under a million switches a year. It is worth comparing the market to see if you could find a better deal, as a low interest rate environment should not lull consumers into thinking that all current accounts are the same.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, if you\u2019re being wooed by your bank to take on a packaged account think long and hard about it first. Above all, question whether the fees are affordable, if you\u2019d use the benefits and check for any cover or benefits you already have that do the same job.", "description": "It seems like such a good idea at the time.\u00a0 Take your bog-standard current account and pay a couple of pounds a month to get all the financial products you\u2019d buy anyway included in the package.
