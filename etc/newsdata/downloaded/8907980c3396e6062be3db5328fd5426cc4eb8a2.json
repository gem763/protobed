The administration has so far resisted sharing the details of the complaint with lawmakers.\n\n\u201cIf the administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,\u201d Pelosi wrote.\n\nSenator Mitt Romney, who has clashed with Trump in the past, sounded a rare note of concern among Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans.\n\n\u201cIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out,\u201d he said in a Twitter post.\n\nTrump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is at the center of the escalating battle in Washington.\n\nNews reports on Friday said Trump repeatedly asked Zelensky to investigate whether Biden misused his position as vice president to threaten to withhold U.S. aid unless a prosecutor who was looking into a gas company in which Biden\u2019s son was involved was fired.\n\nBiden has confirmed he wanted the prosecutor fired but denies it was to help his son. Biden said the wider U.S. government, the European Union and other international institutions also wanted the prosecutor fired for his alleged failure to pursue major corruption cases.\n\nFILE PHOTO: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) listens to a question from the moderator during a discussion on the Mueller investigation at a Center for American Progress (CAP) forum in Washington, U.S., July 23, 2019.

I do think we need to get to the bottom of that,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Murphy said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Congress needs to hear from the whistleblower. If the allegations are sustained, there would be an \u201copen-and-shut\u201d case for impeachment, he said.\n\nImpeachment proceedings in Congress, which begin in the House, can lead to a president being removed from office, but Democrats would need the support of Republicans, who control the Senate.\n\nAccording to Friday\u2019s reports, Trump urged Zelensky, a comedian who had just won election, to speak with Giuliani.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump responds to reporter's questions as he departs to Texas from the White House, Washington, DC, U.S., September 22, 2019.
