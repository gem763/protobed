In an interpretation of the rule that WADA applied to Coleman, his first missed test, on June 6, 2018, was backdated to the start of the quarter in which he missed the test, April 1, which put it outside of the 12-month window between that failure and his latest one, on April 26, 2019.\n\nWATCH | Christian Coleman runs 7th-fastest 100 metres of all-time:\n\nAmerican Christian Coleman ran a world leading time of 9.79 seconds, to win the men's 100m race at the IAAF Diamond League final in Brussels, Belgium. 3:05\n\nIt was an interpretation of the rule that USADA did not initially anticipate, and one that will be eliminated when the WADA code is revised for 2021.\n\nAnd though USADA does not discuss ongoing cases in public, because this one got leaked to the media, and because Coleman subsequently commented on it, it freed up USADA to explain its side of the case.\n\nBolt shifted focus to the track\n\n\"In this case, we applied the rules to Mr. Coleman in the manner that USADA understands should be applied to any other international-level athlete,\" USADA CEO Travis Tygart explained.\n\nMost fans probably won't delve into the minutiae of this issue, but will see the words \"Doping\" and \"Track\" in the headlines and think \"nothing new there.\"\n\nFor the better part of 10 years, Bolt shifted that focus \u2014 even deflecting away inevitable questions about his own clean doping record with a smile, or by earnestly taking umbrage at the mere suggestion \u2014 and placed it squarely on the track, where his light all but blinded everyone from this sport's ever-growing laundry list of warts and imperfections (Remember, the Russian doping scandal began as a track and field issue, and barring an unexpected move by track's governing body this week, Russians will compete as neutral athletes with their track federation still under suspension).\n\nNow that Bolt is gone, the top two contenders in Saturday's 100 final in Doha, Qatar, are expected to be Coleman and defending champion Justin Gatlin, a 37-year-old who has been suspended twice for doping violations and whose victory at worlds in London in 2017 was greeted with skepticism from the media and boos from the stands.\n\n\"I know you have to have the black hat and the white hat, but guys, c'mon,\" Gatlin said after his victory, in responding to the booing and the harsh questioning that accompanied the win.\n\nCan any sprinter, whether declared innocent, or insistent that he's changed his ways, get a clean start in a sport that demands exactly that?\n\nMaybe Coleman's trip to Doha, with less than a year to go before the 2020 Olympics, will offer some sort of answer.", "description": "Christian Coleman will be running under a cloud of suspicion by some at the upcoming world track and field championships after his recent case for a potential doping violation was dropped by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, and the sprinter is assailing USADA for being sloppy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5293136.1569161224!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/coleman-christian-190620-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
