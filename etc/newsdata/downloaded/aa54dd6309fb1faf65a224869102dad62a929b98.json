They went out to eat and drank nice wine; hosted parties; and lived in a posh home in Santa Cruz, Calif., with a hot tub, garden and huge redwood deck that Akaisha calls \u201cher dream home.\u201d But they barely got to see one another as both had long, but different, hours, with Billy getting into work early and Akaisha working nights. \u201cWe were burned out,\u201d Akaisha explains. Billy adds: \u201cI started to wonder how much longer I could continue on that treadmill.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s when Billy had an idea: As a stockbroker, he\u2019d seen his clients traveling and retiring and had a sense of how much money this took. He started thinking that maybe he and Akaisha could do it, too \u2014 if they sold their home, the restaurant and their cars, scaled back their lifestyle and moved somewhere inexpensive.\n\n\u201cI started penciling in the numbers,\u201d says Billy, who is a proponent of the 4% rule. \u201cThe big question was, how much is enough to live on?\u201d\n\nFor the next two years the couple meticulously tracked their spending and the crunched numbers on inexpensive places to live. In 1991 \u2014 after selling their major assets and investing that money \u2014 they retired at the age of 38, and have lived abroad on about $30,000 a year since that time, they say. (They now receive Social Security, but before that they lived off the proceeds of their investments.)\n\nHere\u2019s what it\u2019s like, for the Kaderlis, to live abroad, what it costs, the challenges faced, and more.\n\nTheir philosophy for keeping living costs low: \u2018Geographical arbitrage\u2019\n\nThe Kaderlis have lived in Thailand, Guatemala, Vietnam and Ecuador, among other spots. They pick where they live based on a lot of things, like great weather, where they can learn a new skill (Thai massage, anyone?) and where there are interesting volunteer opportunities, but cost is the biggest factor. \u201cI call it geographical arbitrage,\u201d says Billy. \u201cWe pick places where money goes far and quality of life is high.\u201d\n\nThe Kaderlis The Kaderlis in Jinghong, China.\n\nFor the past couple of years, the couple has been living in the Lake Chapala area of Mexico (this is their second stint living here). It\u2019s a spot popular with expats thanks to average temperatures between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (National Geographic ranked the climate the second best in the world), proximity to a gorgeous waterfront (the lake is the largest freshwater lake in Mexico) and a friendly, laid-back vibe. It\u2019s also a little over a half hour from Guadalajara, Mexico\u2019s second largest city, which has an international airport.\n\nIts low cost of living doesn\u2019t hurt: The Kaderlis spend about $1,750 a month to live here, they say. Their biggest expenses, besides travel \u2014 both still go back to the U.S. once a year or so, and they take mini-trips throughout Mexico \u2014 are rent and food. They pay about $300 a month for their apartment. They spend about $200 to $300 a month on groceries and add that they can easily match that amount if they are dining out a lot or entertaining. They keep food costs down because Billy, who is a French-trained chef, cooks most of their meals.\n\nThough they live on a modest budget, Akaisha says they don\u2019t feel deprived. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived in paradises all over the world \u2026 that\u2019s our entertainment,\u201d she says. Plus, she adds, \u201cwe\u2019ve never been big consumers. \u2026 We don\u2019t have all the doodads that people have.\u201d\n\nAnd now that they\u2019ve become permanent residents of Mexico \u2014 Billy says the process took about six weeks and required some annoying \u201cbureaucracy\u201d but wasn\u2019t too bad \u2014 they get senior discounts on first-class buses and free admission to many museums and parks.\n\nThe Kaderlis The Kaderlis.\n\nHealth and safety\n\nThe Kaderlis have taken many different approaches to health care through the years, depending on where they lived, including what Akaisha calls \u201cgoing naked.\u201d (That\u2019s her term for having no U.S.-based health insurance and instead relying on savings to pay for procedures as they need them.) They once had to pay about $3,000 in out-of-pocket costs for health care in Guatemala when Akaisha badly hurt her finger getting off a bus. (They said the care was good, and her finger is fine now.) They\u2019re now enrolled in Medicare so they could get care in the States if they needed it, but Akaisha says that they\u2019ve \u201cnever used it.\u201d\n\nAkaisha and Billy say that people often wonder if their current town in Mexico is safe, because they see headlines about crime in Mexico. But Billy says they haven\u2019t had an incident as they travel about via public transit. But, he concedes, some of \u201cthe border towns are rough.\u201d\n\nThere are other downsides to the area, the couple say. You can\u2019t drink the tap water: \u201cWe have 20-liter bottles of drinking water delivered as needed with a phone call,\u201d says Billy. Other downsides: \u201cLoud culture with parades, music and \u2018cojetes\u2019 [or firecrackers] going off often,\u201d he adds, as well as increasing traffic \u201cas more and more North Americans [are] moving into the area.\u201d\n\nThe Kaderlis The Kaderlis in the Lake Chapala area of Mexico.\n\nWhat it\u2019s like to be retirees for decades\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering whether the Kaderlis are able to fill up their days without the help of a full-time job, it sure seems that way. They write a website about their lives, have authored a book on retiring early, and have volunteered all around the world. Akaisha has taught the locals in Chapala to do Thai massage; Billy coaches and raises money for local sports teams.\n\nAnd even when they\u2019re not doing one of those myriad things, \u201cwe keep busy,\u201d says Billy. \u201cWe wake up in the morning with nothing to do, and at the end of the day we only have half of it done.\u201d", "description": "Want to retire early?
