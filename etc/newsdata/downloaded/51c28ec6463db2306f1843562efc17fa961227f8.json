REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\nEuropean shares are expected to fall, with pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 futures STXEc1 trading down 0.72%, German DAX futures FDXc1 losing 0.79% and FTSE futures FFIc1 off 0.23%.\n\nS&P500 mini futures ESc1 dropped 0.2% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei .N225 was up 0.1% after falling as much as 0.4%. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 0.6%.\n\nOn Tuesday on Wall Street, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.36%.\n\nAfter the bell, Texas Instruments (TXN.O), whose broad lineup of products makes it a proxy for the global chip industry, forecast current-quarter revenue to fall 10%-17% from a year earlier, well below estimates.\n\nTexas Instruments shares tumbled 9.8% in after-hour trade, driving down other chipmaker shares including Intel (INTC.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O).\n\nWorries that the global microchip industry is being squeezed by a downturn in demand and the prolonged U.S.-China trade dispute sent some Asian chip-related shares lower.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s TSMC (2330.TW) fell 0.9% while South Korea\u2019s SK Hynix (000660.KS) shed 1.6% and Japan\u2019s Tokyo Electron (8035.T) slumped 4.3%.\n\n\u201cGiven a recent rally in semi-conductor shares, some adjustments will be inevitable,\u201d said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities.\n\n\u201cBut our investor survey has shown that many investors are still cautious on the sector so a bit of weakness in the industry would surprise few of them,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the currency market, sterling dipped 0.15% to $1.2851 GBP=D4, falling further from five-month highs of $1.3012 set on Monday.\n\nBut the pound still kept hefty gains made over the past fortnight on growing expectations that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided even though it is still not clear what the path ahead will be.\n\nOn Tuesday, the British parliament voted in favour of Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan, but then rejected his timetable to fast-track legislation to take Britain out of the European Union. That effectively meant Britain would not be able to finalise its exit by Johnson\u2019s Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nThe next step, Johnson said, would be waiting for the EU to respond to a request to delay the Oct. 31 Brexit date, which the prime minister reluctantly sent to Brussels on Saturday after being forced to do so by lawmakers.\n\nA source in Johnson\u2019s office said on Tuesday that a new election is the only way to move on from Britain\u2019s Brexit crisis if the European Union agrees to a delay until January.\n\n\u201cBroadly speaking, there are two scenarios. There will be a short extension before the parliament will agree on Johnson\u2019s plan. Or there could be a general election, which would need a longer extension,\u201d said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale.\n\n\u201cBut it now seems unlikely that Britain will crash out of the EU on Oct. 31,\u201d he said.\n\nReceding worries about a no-deal Brexit also underpinned the euro, which stood at $1.1122 EUR=, flat on the day and a tad below Monday\u2019s two-month high of $1.1180.\n\nThe yen ticked up 0.15% to 108.31 yen per dollar JPY=, in a slow recovery since hitting a 2-1/2-month low of 108.94 on Thursday.\n\nThe dollar was broadly weak, ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting next week at which policymakers are expected to cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage point.\n\nOil prices fell after industry group data showed U.S. crude stocks rose more than expected last week.\n\nStill, on the whole the market held firm after China signalled progress in trade talks with the United States and OPEC and its allies pondered deeper production cuts.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures fell 0.52% to $59.39 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 lost 0.81% to $54.04 per barrel.", "description": "U.S. stock futures and Asian shares slipped on Wednesday as revenue warnings from Texas Instruments raised worries about the global tech sector and after British lawmakers forced the government to hit the pause button on the latest Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Hideyuki Sano", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1443929996&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M01T-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
