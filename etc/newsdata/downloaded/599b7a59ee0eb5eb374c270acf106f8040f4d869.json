This year, the budget proposed to cut last year\u2019s $300 million in funding to the Great Lakes by 90 percent.\n\n\u201cActions speak louder than words.

Always have. They're beautiful. They're big. Very deep. Record deepness,\u201d Trump said during a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., in March.\n\n\u201cAnd I'm going to get, in honor of my friends, full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative,\u201d he continued.\n\nTrump was also personally involved in efforts to bring a Foxconn plant to Wisconsin that would manufacture LCD screens, a process that requires large volumes of pristine water. The project secured a major tax break from the state despite complaints that the project could violate EPA standards by exacerbating smog. Critics also said environmental assessment overlooked water rights issues that limit how towns just outside of the basin access the lakes.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement followed the EPA\u2019s latest lead policy proposal, another key issue for the region.\n\nThe proposal changes testing requirements for lead and speeds up notification for those who may have lead in their drinking water, but could slow the replacement of the lead pipes that connect homes to city services.", "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced Tuesday it would send millions of dollars to the Great Lakes area for cleanup projects, a renewed pledge by the Trump administration after repeated attempts to scuttle funding for the region.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/greatlakes_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
