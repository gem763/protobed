Scary stuff pic.twitter.com/33RFnkVgWB \u2014 Matt Jones (@KySportsRadio) October 12, 2019\n\nIn footage of the collapse shared on Twitter, you can see vehicles swerving and people fleeing from falling debris as it rains down one of the city\u2019s main thoroughfare, Canal Street. One video taken from inside a streetcar nearly directly beneath the hotel shows how quickly dust and detritus blanketed the area like a thick fog. The scene looks like something straight out of a disaster movie.\n\nShocking video shared via @BrienFallon: As the under-construction Hard Rock Hotel in New Orleans collapsed, vehicles and a streetcar dodged debris falling down from the construction site as captured from inside a streetcar.

It weighs several tons.\u201d\n\nRescue crews are currently searching for two missing contractors believed to be inside. \u201cWe assume they are alive,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nAt least 18 people were injured in the incident and taken to nearby hospitals, though additional reports are still coming in, CNN reported. A third contractor originally believed to be missing has since been located among the injured. So far, no pedestrians or motorists passing by the hotel when it partially collapsed have reported injuries, McConnell said.", "description": "Portions of an under-construction Hard Rock Hotel in New Orleans collapsed Saturday, killing at least one person and trapping several contractors inside according to local reports....", "authors": ["Sam Rutherford", "Julie Muncy"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/qvhwqqox8926ulsepfre.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
