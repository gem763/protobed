Kyle\u2019s lawyer then interrupted again saying the youngster wanted to know what the word \u2018arson\u2019 meant, prompting Feeney to tell him: \u2018You knowingly set a fire.\u2019 The youngster \u2013 accused of killing his two toddler half-siblings, toddler cousin, mother\u2019s boyfriend and step-great-grandma-to-be in April, broke down as the hearing came to a close.\n\nHe left the court sobbing with his arms folded as the gravity of his situation appeared to dawn on him. The youngster was accompanied by his paternal grandfather, News9 reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKyle is accused of deliberately setting his family\u2019s trailer home in Goodfield, Illinois, ablaze and murdering his two year-old half-brother Daemeon Wall and one year-old half-sister Ariel Wall.\n\nAlso killed in the blaze was Daemeon and Ariel\u2019s great-grandma Kathryn Murray, 69, and her grandson Jason Wall (Pictures: Legacy.com)\n\nHis two year-old cousin Rose Alwood also died in the blaze, as did his stepdad Jason Wall, 34, and Wall\u2019s grandma Kathryn Murray, 69.\n\nAll five died of smoke inhalation, with eyewitnesses hearing their screams as the trailer burned.\n\nKyle\u2019s fate will be decided by a judge, rather than a jury trial.\n\nIf convicted, the youngster will not be sent to prison, and is likely to face around five years probation, with any such punishment concluded by the time he turns 21.\n\nEarlier this month, his mother Katie Alwood spoke out to identify her son, insist that Kyle is not a monster, and say that she forgives him for what he allegedly did.\n\nAll five were killed in this April 2019 blaze at a mobile home in Goodfield, Illinois (Picture: Shawn Johnson)\n\nKatie told CBS News: \u2018Everyone is looking at him like he\u2019s some kind of monster, but that\u2019s not who he is.\n\n\u2018People make mistakes, and that\u2019s what this is.\n\n\u2018Yes, it was a horrible tragedy, but it\u2019s still not something to throw his life away over.\u2019\n\nKatie has since been hit with a gagging order preventing her from speaking about her son again. She is currently in hospital being treated for an unspecified illness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExplaining his reasoning for charging Kyle, prosecutor Greg Minger said the decision was a \u2018heavy\u2019 one.\n\nHe added: \u2018It\u2019s a tragedy, but at the end of the day it\u2019s charging a very young person with one of the most serious crimes we have.\n\n\u2018But I just think it needs to be done at this point, for finality.\u2019\n\nKyle is due back in court for a pre-trial hearing on November 22.", "description": "Kyle Alwood", "authors": ["Jimmy Mccloskey"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1570717400-48c3_1571752557.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
