REUTERS/Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah\n\nThe government was formed as part of a three-year power-sharing deal signed last month between the military and civilian parties and protest groups.\n\nPrime Minister Abdalla Hamdok announced the names of 18 ministers in the new Cabinet, and said he would name two more later.\n\n\u201c(The new government) will start its work immediately in a harmonious and collective way,\u201d Hamdok told a news conference in Khartoum on Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cToday, we start a new phase in our history. ... We are seeking the establishment of a national project and the restructure of the Sudanese state,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new government is an important step in transition away from nearly 30 years under Bashir, when Sudan was afflicted by internal conflicts, international isolation and deep economic problems.\n\nHowever, the months since Bashir\u2019s fall have been marked by tension between the powerful security forces and civilian groups that are pushing for democracy, reform and justice for those killed during crackdowns on protests.\n\nThe announcement of the Cabinet had been held up by haggling over positions.\n\nMost of the 18 ministers announced on Thursday were approved earlier in the week. The Cabinet includes four women, among them Asmaa Abdallah, who becomes the country\u2019s first female foreign minister.\n\nIt also includes Ibrahim Elbadawi, a former World Bank economist who will serve as finance minister, and Madani Abbas Madani, a leader of the civilian coalition that negotiated the transition deal with the military, as a minister of industry and trade.\n\nGeneral Jamal Omar, a member of the Transitional Military Council that took over from Bashir, was appointed as defence minister.\n\nCHALLENGES FACING NEW GOVERNMENT\n\nAmong the challenges facing Hamdok\u2019s government are finding billions in funding to cover the country\u2019s bill for importing basic goods like fuel and flour, negotiating Sudan\u2019s removal from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, and slashing military spending that accounts for as much as 70% of the budget.\n\nSecurity and peacemaking in regions affected by insurgencies under Bashir are further challenges.\n\n\u201cThe top priority of the transitional period is to stop war and to build sustainable peace,\u201d Hamdok said on Thursday, adding that Sudan is forming a committee to establish a framework for a Peace Commission.\n\n\u201cArmed factions are an integral part of the revolution and the current (political) climate provides a great chance to reach understandings on peace,\u201d he said.\n\nSudan\u2019s future is seen as crucial for a volatile region plagued by conflict. Wealthy Gulf states including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have been vying for influence and have close ties to Sudan\u2019s top military commanders.\n\nThe military ousted and arrested Bashir after 16 weeks of protests triggered by an economic crisis that included sharp inflation and shortages of cash and fuel.\n\nA military council took over and began talks with protest and opposition groups, but negotiations were marred by lethal violence used against ongoing demonstrations.\n\nAccording to last month\u2019s deal a sovereign council will preside over the first 21 months before handing over to civilian leadership for another 18 months ahead of elections.\n\nChanges in Sudan have evoked memories of the Arab Spring uprisings that swept across the region in 2011, when early hopes of reform gave way to military resurgence and conflict in several countries.", "description": "Sudan's prime minister announced on Thursday the formation of the first government since the overthrow of longtime ruler Omar Hassan al-Bashir in April.", "authors": ["Khalid Abdelaziz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426831203&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850NX-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
