(Sam Greenwood / Getty Images)\n\nJalen Ramsey wants out of Jacksonville. The star cornerback made that clear after he got into a sideline argument with Coach Doug Marrone in the second game of the season, and again last week when he asked to be traded. He also wants more money. He made that clear when he arrived at training camp in an armored vehicle.\n\nOn Sunday night, the disconnect between the cornerback and the Jaguars reached a different level when Ramsey called in sick, saying that he would be unable to practice Monday, ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported. Although the network\u2019s Josina Anderson and Ryan Clark both reported that Ramsey is legitimately ill and believes he has the flu, he later was spotted at the team facility Monday. Players were off Tuesday and Ramsey, according to ESPN, is expected to be in the facility Wednesday.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear whether he will be able to practice and what his status would be for Sunday\u2019s game against the Broncos in Denver because the NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport reports that he has been receiving treatment for \u201cissues related to his lower back and hamstrings\u201d because he is \u201ca little banged up.\u201d\n\nGiven that his trade demand is being denied by owner Shad Khan, it seems as if he has decided to go back to work after a curiously timed illness. On Monday Marrone refused to talk about it. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not getting into that \u2014 odd or anything,\u201d Marrone told reporters Monday, via ESPN. \u201cIf you\u2019re sick, you\u2019re sick, right? What are you going to do?\u201d\n\nRamsey was to have seen a team physician Monday and it seems unlikely that he wouldn\u2019t play Sunday. The 1-2 Jaguars are coming off a division win over the Tennessee Titans and have a new folk hero in eccentric quarterback Gardner Minshew II, but Ramsey continues to dominate the headlines.\n\n[Antonio Brown reenrolls at Central Michigan, but does he have a future in the NFL?]\n\n\u201cIt [a player missing practice with an illness] has happened \u2014 I don\u2019t want to exaggerate and say hundreds of times \u2014 but it\u2019s happened quite a bit,\u201d Marrone said. \u201cIt\u2019s happened here since I\u2019ve been the head coach a couple times. It\u2019s happened with Myles [Jack], where I actually was in the [team] hotel with him and he stayed there. It\u2019s happened.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s nothing as big, but I understand that\u2019s probably a big story because of the other things that are surrounding it.\u201d\n\nIndeed. Here\u2019s how Ramsey and the Jaguars got to this point:\n\nHow good is Ramsey?\n\nA two-time Pro Bowl honoree, the cornerback, who turns 25 next month, was the fifth overall pick by the Jaguars out of Florida State in the 2016 draft. He was part of the defense that helped the Jaguars advance to the AFC championship game, losing to New England, after the 2017 season.\n\nWhat does he want?\n\nRamsey wants what we all want: More money. He is in the fourth year of his rookie contract, and the team has picked up his option for next season. He signed the four-year deal in May, 2016, getting $23.35 million that included $22.90 million guaranteed with a signing bonus of $15.18 million.\n\nWhere do the two sides stand?\n\nRamsey and the Jaguars, who have refused to go to Defcon 1 over his illness, are at a standoff, with the team uninterested in accommodating the trade request and team owner Shad Khan reportedly still willing to make Ramsey the league\u2019s highest-paid cornerback. Ramsey played Thursday night when the Jaguars beat the Titans, 20-7, four days after he and Marrone mixed it up. In the Sept. 15 one-point loss to the Texans, Ramsey was angry that Marrone did not challenge a dropped ball that was ruled a catch. He and Marrone briefly made physical contact as they jawed at one another and Jaguars players stepped in.\n\nJalen Ramsey is not happy, part II pic.twitter.com/FzJUJR7N3t \u2014 Rivers McCown (@riversmccown) September 15, 2019\n\nDid anything besides money cause him to want a trade?\n\nAfter that Week 2 loss, Ramsey told the Uninterrupted \u201c17 Weeks\u201d podcast that the final catalyst for his trade demand was a conversation he had with team management.\n\n\u201cThere had been an incident on the sideline with me and coach. I didn\u2019t think much of that in particular because that happens from time to time. That\u2019s passion and emotion I feel like that blew up a little bit more than it should have,\u201d Ramsey said (via Jaguarswire). \u201cThat happened early in the first quarter, and I went out the rest of the game, and you can see the production that I put out there on the field. What I held \u2018Hop [DeAndre Hopkins] to, and how the whole defense played, honestly.\"\n\nAfter the game, according to Ramsey, \u201csome disrespectful things were said on their end that made me definitely walk out and call my agent as soon as I walked out, and I told him, I said, \u2018It\u2019s time; my time is up here in Jacksonville. I want to ask for a trade.'\u201d\n\nRamsey didn\u2019t specify which members of management he\u2019d spoken with. He said on the podcast that he \u201cwas truly at peace\u201d after the trade demand. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in a mind-set of making a decision while I was angry; I was completely calm. I still stand by my decision to ask for a trade.\u201d\n\nHis demeanor after the Jaguars\u2019 first win of the season was that of a man who had played his last game for a team.\n\n\u201cRequesting the trade was something that\u2019s been building over a little bit of time,\u201d Ramsey said on the podcast. \u201cIt has nothing to do with my teammates here \u2014 I love my teammates here. It has nothing to do with the city \u2014 I love the city here. Still doing my charity work here, still out with the fans, signing autographs, taking pictures, whatever. I love the city here, I love my teammates, but it\u2019s more so with the front office and the organization.\"\n\n[Daniel Jones\u2019s debut changes everything for the Giants]\n\nWhat teams would make sense for Ramsey, even though the team has said it won\u2019t trade him?\n\nSeveral teams would reportedly be interested, but the Jaguars, at least initially, are asking for too much in return, ESPN reported last week. The caveat has been that teams are out for now. The Jaguars could make him available if his behavior deteriorates, the way Antonio Brown\u2019s did in Oakland.\n\nIn the meantime, CBS reported that the Kansas City Chiefs, Philadelphia Eagles, Seattle Seahawks and Baltimore Ravens are all \u201cmonitoring the Ramsey situation.\u201d ESPN also reported that the Eagles were \u201cdoing their homework\u201d on Ramsey. NFL.com speculated that the Eagles, Chiefs, Oakland Raiders and Detroit Lions could be fits.\n\nWhy is Ramsey always in the headlines?\n\nRamsey has often made news for his outspokenness, becoming a convenient trash-talking target along the way. Along with former teammates Tashaun Gipson and Davon House, he criticized how the defensive backs were used during the 2016 season, and he didn\u2019t like the team\u2019s defensive calls in the fourth quarter of the AFC championship game loss to the Patriots in 2018.\n\nThat summer, he unloaded on a number of NFL quarterbacks in a GQ story that appeared shortly after he had been suspended for a week for a profane rant against reporters who were filming a training-camp dust-up between Dante Fowler Jr. and Yannick Ngakoue. In a tweet, he threatened war with the media.\n\nRead more NFL coverage from The Post:\n\nTom Brady has \u2018personal feelings\u2019 about Antonio Brown but won\u2019t say what they are\n\nPatriots quickly moved on from Antonio Brown, but Julian Edelman\u2019s injury is an issue\n\nHow the deal between Antonio Brown and the Patriots dissolved\n\nThe Saints prove they are more than just Drew Brees in a win over the Seahawks\n\nRams overcome a slow start and late interception, hang on for a win over Browns\n\nThe Scottish Hammer: How Jamie Gillan went from Scotland to an HBCU to Browns rookie standout\n\nHow Michael Vick\u2019s dogfighting case changed animal welfare", "description": "From an armored truck to a trade demand to an apparent illness, here's what you need to know about the Jaguars\u2019 star cornerback, who is expected back at work Wednesday.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories", "September At Am", "Cindy Boren Arrived At The Post In As An Assignment Editor In Charge Of Baseball", "Nfl Redskins Coverage.
