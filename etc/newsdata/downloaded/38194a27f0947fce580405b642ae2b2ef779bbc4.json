It appears to have been made exclusively for existing \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d fans who were wondering about what happened to Aaron Paul\u2019s character Jessie Pinkman after the series finale.\n\nAs we acknowledge in the latest episode of the Original Content podcast, Jordan is the only regular OC host who\u2019s actually seen the entirety of \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d And she was reasonably satisfied with the film, feeling that it had some of the same strengths as \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d \u2014 though it didn\u2019t quite capture the strong character development and elaborate plotting that made the series great.\n\nDarrell, meanwhile, gets a chance to explain why he\u2019s so resistant to \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d and why nothing in \u201cEl Camino\u201d changed his mind.\n\nIn addition to our review, we discuss Netflix\u2019s latest earnings, in which which the streamer reported better-than-expected profits, despite still-sluggish subscriber growth in the United States.\n\nYou can listen in the player below, subscribe using Apple Podcasts or find us in your podcast player of choice.
