She lost her father, a BSF man, to cancer in 2010 and was raised, along with four of her other siblings, by her mother Ishwanti Devi.\n\n\"I started as a kabaddi player but that's a team sport and credit is shared. Boxing attracted me because it's an individual sport, the glory is all yours alone,\" she recalled.\n\nAP\n\n\"My mother was very supportive of my career choice. She backed me to the hilt,\" she added.\n\nIt also helped that she had Olympic medal winners in Vijender Singh and MC Mary Kom to look up to.\n\n\"Vijender bhaiya and Mary didi have inspired so many and I am one of them. Just looking at what they have achieved makes you want to work harder. I used to watch them and feel good about taking up this sport,\" she told PTI.\n\nIt is a massive feat for the young prodigy, and one that she will never forget. The medal win will also be a massive boost for not only her confidence, but also the career going ahead.\n\n(With Inputs From PTI)", "description": "In her maiden World Championships, Manju Rani stole the show as she fought with all her might on her way to a silver medal win.
