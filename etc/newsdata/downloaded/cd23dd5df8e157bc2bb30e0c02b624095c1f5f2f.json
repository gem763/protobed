Books offer tourists \u201csomething tangible and not digital,\u201d he added; they\u2019re not just another posed photo in front of the sunset.\n\nRight on cue a customer interrupted to ask whether pictures were allowed in the store: \u201cIt\u2019s so cool.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Mr. Walzer said.\n\nAlmost despite itself, the shop has become a tourist attraction. That is especially strange for Mr. Walzer, who for years called the cozy place home. He alternated beds. One is hidden behind shelves now displaying copies of Homer\u2019s \u201cOdyssey\u201d and the Harry Potter series in ancient Greek. The other one (\u201cthe master bedroom,\u201d Mr. Walzer called it) sits above the German section. That spot is now occupied by one of the store\u2019s employees, Katie Berry, a 22-year-old graduate in English from Harvard (\u201cSurprise,\u201d she deadpanned) who was spending her third summer sleeping amid the stacks.", "description": "Atlantis Books on Santorini has become a popular tourist attraction and one of Europe\u2019s most enchanting bookshops.
