How to see the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the cheap", "language": "en", "text": "Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s capital is now connected to the UK via the first direct flights in a decade. So what have we been missing?\n\nSarajevo wears its rich and turbulent history surprisingly lightly, with its restored Austro-Hungarian riverside houses and Ottoman-era bazaars.\n\nLate-night bars and restaurants make for a fun, friendly city that\u2019s walkable and as cheap as chips. It feels a bit like being let in on a secret that won\u2019t stay under wraps for long.\n\nSarajevo, pictured, Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s capital, is now connected to the UK via the first direct flights in a decade\n\nWhere to stay\n\nHotel Holiday\n\nBuilt for the 1984 Winter Olympics, what was once a decaying Holiday Inn used by war correspondents during the Nineties conflicts has been given an overhaul, bringing this yellow and brown behemoth back to its Socialist heyday.\n\nThe bamboo wardrobes, canary yellow bathroom suites and old-school Omega clocks in the lobby are, depending on your taste, either a horrible throwback or a pleasingly retro time warp. B&B doubles are from \u00a355 (hoteleuropegroup.ba)\n\nHotel Story\n\nMonochrome rules the roost at this rather masculine-styled mixture of rooms and apartments, where each floor is known as a \u2018chapter\u2019 in the Story.\n\nRooms are bright with big windows, and low-lying beds and sofas make for a spacious, airy feel. And the location is a belter; right in the middle of the Old Town. B&B doubles are from \u00a365 (story-hotel.com)\n\nHostel Franz Ferdinand\n\nAt first, it doesn\u2019t feel like huge photos of World War I soldiers and battlegrounds will make for the most soothing of night- time accompaniments, but this clean, modern hostel somehow makes it work.\n\nThe self-catering apartments are an absolute steal, and come with a terrace, small garden and even a complimentary ironing and laundry service. Self-catering apartments are from \u00a353 (franzferdinandhostel.com)\n\nWhat to see and do\n\nFind the roots of the Great War\n\nWalk along the Latin Bridge and you\u2019ll pass the exact spot where Gavrilo Princip assassinated Franz Ferdinand in 1914 and ignited the Great War.\n\nThere\u2019s no monument to the event, so be prepared to recall your favourite lines from Blackadder Goes Forth if you want any added history \u2018lessons\u2019.\n\nSee Bosnia\u2019s most beautiful building\n\nSarajevo's City Hall was destroyed during the war but painstaking work has revived it back to its former majesty\n\nIts azure and gold atrium, Islamic style arches and mosaic glass were all but destroyed during the war, but painstaking work has revived the City Hall back to its former majesty.\n\nReopened in 2014, the exhibitions inside tell the story of the city (tickets 90p, vijecnica.ba).\n\nMake time for Tito\n\nThe shadow of Josip Broz Tito, long-time leader of the former Yugoslavia, still hangs long over what is now seven separate nations. Caffe Tito is full of memorabilia and pictures of the marshal. Sip a Sarajevsko beer in the leafy garden, next to a genuine Yugoslav-era army truck.\n\nDig deep at the Tunnel of Hope\n\nThe Sarajevo Tunnel of Hope was dug by desperate locals during the Nineties conflict, which became the only link between besieged Sarajevo and the outside world\n\nIt may look like a modest backyard of a suburban home, but underneath lies a tunnel dug by desperate locals during the Nineties conflict, which became the only link between besieged Sarajevo and the outside world.\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating insight into the realities of war and the fortitude of locals (\u00a34.50, tunelspasa.ba).\n\nEmbrace street life\n\nNowhere shows off Sarajevo\u2019s diversity like the main shopping drag.\n\nSpot artisans creating shoes, jewellery, daggers and selling coffee, antique watches and homburg hats in stores unchanged in decades.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nWarming: A Bosnian speciality soup\n\nBarhana\n\nThis cosy, atmospheric restaurant is full of candles, cushions, divans and, in the evenings, canoodling locals.\n\nBosnian specialities include peppers stuffed with mincemeat and an unctuous white bean soup (from \u00a32.25).\n\nBe wary of the huge menu of flavoured local grappas, though; they\u2019re delicious, but potent. Visit barhana.ba.\n\nCevabdzinica Zeljo\n\nYou haven\u2019t been to Bosnia until you\u2019ve eaten cevapcici; toasted flatbread stuffed to bursting with onions and sausages and served on a metal plate alongside a small paddling pool of yoghurt (from \u00a31.75).\n\nCevabdzinica Zeljo is the best spot in town to sample this classic dish. Take a pew at the communal bench seats, get chatting to locals and be prepared to voice your support for FK Zeljeznicar, the local football team. Address: Kundurdziluk 19\n\nKaruzo\n\nBoy, do Bosnians like their meat. But if your urge for greens overwhelms you, salvation is at hand at this intimate space behind the market, where chef and owner Sasa Obucina cooks up an all-veggie menu.\n\nTry the herb-infused polenta with porcini mushroom sauce (\u00a35.90) or the wholegrain pancakes with lentils and rosemary sauce alongside a mostly Bosnian wine list.
