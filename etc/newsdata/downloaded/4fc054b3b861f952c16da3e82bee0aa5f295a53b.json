Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis -- as well as her two children.\n\nCARLY SIMON REVEALS SEAN CONNERY ASKED FOR M\u00c9NAGE-\u00c0-TROIS WITH HER SISTER\n\n\u201cWhy am I writing about someone so private who disliked attention?\u201d the 74-year-old told People magazine on Wednesday. \u201cIf someone affects your life as Jackie did mine, you can\u2019t not write about her. [But] I withheld a great deal.\u201d\n\nAccording to Simon, it was Onassis\u2019 son John F. Kennedy Jr. who introduced his mother to her on Martha\u2019s Vineyard back in 1983. The two remained close until Onassis\u2019 death in 1994 at age 64.\n\n\u201cI could be neurotic, bohemian and all over the place; she always had to be so correct,\u201d revealed the \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain\u201d singer. \u201cI was who she wasn\u2019t. I think she got a big kick out of that.\u201d\n\nWhile Onassis was 16 years older than Simon and notoriously private, it didn\u2019t take long for her to open up.\n\nCARLY SIMON'S EX-HUSBAND JAMES HART TELLS ALL IN NEW MEMOIR\n\nSimon said Onassis even talked about President Kennedy\u2019s adultery.\n\n\u201c[She] understood that he made some stupid mistakes,\u201d said Simon. However, she told the outlet that Onassis brushed off the affairs because \u201cshe knew he loved her more, much more.\u201d\n\nOnassis also got candid about her second husband, Onassis, whom she married in 1968 \u2014 five years after Kennedy\u2019s 1963 assassination.\n\n\u201cShe said he was very sexy \u2014 he would sing to her on his yacht and take her great places to make love,\u201d Simon recalled. \u201cShe knew marrying him was the bad-girl move. In a way, I never knew whether she was sticking up for her own decision or whether she really loved him.\u201d\n\nJACKIE KENNEDY'S ASSISTANT KATHY MCKEON DISHES ON THE FORMER FIRST LADY\n\nNo matter what was occurring in Onassis\u2019 love life, she remained fiercely protective of her son John Jr. and daughter, Caroline Kennedy. Simon said Onassis was particularly worried about her son.\n\n\u201cJackie was very consumed with getting him on the right path,\u201d Simon explained. \u201cShe didn\u2019t approve of some of [the women] \u2014 she was horrified by Madonna.\u201d\n\nBut Simon also stressed that Onassis was \u201cincredibly funny.\u201d She described how the two women attended a recording session with opera singer Placido Domingo in 1990. The next day, Simon received a gushing letter and photograph from him. But when Simon called Onassis to share the exciting news, she got an unexpected revelation.\n\n\u201cShe paused for a long time, and then she said, \u2018Carly, did you really think it was from Placido?\u2019\u201d said Simon. \u201cShe\u2019d written it up herself and disguised her handwriting! The practical joker in her was nonstop.\u201d", "description": "Carly Simon admitted it took years for her to finally speak out about her friendship with Jackie\u00a0Kennedy Onassis during the last decade of her life.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-585797865.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
