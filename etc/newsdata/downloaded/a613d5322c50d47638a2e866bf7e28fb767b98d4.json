They failed to complete the most basic element of playing defense in the NFL \u2014 line up with a full unit.\n\nThe Eagles put 10 men on the field on the play, and the Lions recognized it, gashing the Philadelphia defense with a 44-yard run on a reverse from running back J.D. McKissic.\n\n.@lions v @eagles and #JJMcKissic goes for +44 on this reverse against a 10 man defense. 10 MAN DEFENSE! No one sees this from the #Birds?

Stafford recognized the Eagles\u2019 mistake and took advantage of it.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really supposed to seal the end on that play,\" Stafford told reporters. \"We only had 10 guys (to face) because there was no end over there, so I just kept moving and found the next guy. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s been hit a lot harder than that, but I at least tried to get in the way.\u201d\n\nThe drive resulted in a 25-yard Matt Prater field goal that gave Detroit a 17-10 lead. The Lions won the game, 27-24, so it\u2019s safe to say that was a pivotal score for Detroit.\n\nWhile dropped passes are certainly troublesome, this was an inexcusable mistake.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Doug Pederson has plenty to be frustrated with after Sunday's loss to the Lions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/K2KRdGP_ljSEVu2PaVv0yg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTIuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_yc7p9aq2HE7c3maE.EY8g--~B/aD0xOTE2O3c9Mjg3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/fdd96b30-df21-11e9-b23f-01fbab8aa81f", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
