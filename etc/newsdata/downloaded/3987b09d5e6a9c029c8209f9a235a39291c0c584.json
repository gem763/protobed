Five years after somehow transforming Frozen star Idina Menzel\u2019s name into \u201cAdele Dazeem\u201d at the Oscars (he returned a year later to creepily stroke Menzel\u2019s cheek), Travolta decided to own last month\u2019s MTV VMAs, awkwardly trying to hand over the award for video of the year to drag queen Jade Jolie instead of its actual recipient Taylor Swift. Blaming the gaffe on an overcrowded stage, the noted Scientologist went on to offer another glimpse into the unique planet he orbits during a subsequent interview with the radio station Hot 93.3. \u201cWe\u2019re in pretty good shape on the day ... \u201d he said without irony, \u201cwhen that kind of thing can make headlines.\u201d\n\n2017 Oscars v basic reading\n\nObviously the 2017 Oscars will go down as the year Warren Beatty, in his best comedic performance since Dick Tracy, threw a bemused Faye Dunaway under the bus and had her read out Hollywood\u2019s big-screen remake of Glee, AKA La La Land, as the winner of best picture (spoiler alert: the winner was actually Moonlight). The fact that La La Land\u2019s entire cast and crew were onstage accepting the award by the time producers came out to let them know they needed to take several seats only compounded the issue. But that wasn\u2019t the only balls-up on the night, with Michael Keaton introducing multi-Oscar nominee Hidden Figures as \u201cHidden Fences\u201d, a case of word blindness that had similarly inflicted various red-carpet reporters (including George W Bush\u2019s daughter Jenna Bush Hager), BuzzFeed and NBC Today.\n\nMichael Jackson v his ego\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Having his cake... Britney Spears and Michael Jackson. Photograph: Kevin Kane/WireImage\n\nOne indisputable fact about Michael Jackson is that he won a lot of awards, including a Golden Globe for a song about a rat. Perhaps his most memorable award, however, was one that didn\u2019t actually exist. At the 2002 MTV VMAs, a ceremony that happened to coincide with his 44th birthday, Jackson was presented with a cake by Britney Spears who, in her excitement, introduced him as the \u201cartist of the millennium\u201d. Faux flattered but obviously not entirely surprised, Jackson ran with it, launching into a speech about how he could never have dreamed of winning such an accolade, before eventually offering thanks to \u2013 and why not? \u2013 magician David Blaine. The confused audience dutifully gave a standing ovation while an MTV spokesperson offered up a classic \u201cI think some wires got crossed\u201d post-show denouement.\n\nTerry Wogan v Scooch\n\nMore of a poisoned chalice than an award, representing the United Kingdom at Eurovision used to involve a sort of pre-party where session singers, failed Voice contestants and part-time baristas converged to sing songs they hoped would humiliate them on a much larger scale. In 2007, the pop world was shaken when Steps\u2019 unofficial tribute band Scooch re-formed and entered Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up, as it was then called, with the aviation-themed Flying the Flag (For You). After making it to the final two alongside the mononymous Cyndi, the show\u2019s hosts Fearne Cotton and Terry Wogan announced the winner. Well, actually, each announced their own winner, at the same time, with Fearne correctly going with Scooch and Terry bellowing \u201cCyndi\u201d. Once the dust had settled and poor Cyndi was hastily ushered off stage, it was left to cultural commentator Charlotte Church to sum up the mood of the country when she denounced the song as \u201cabsolute shit\u201d. They came 23rd.\n\nAdele v James Corden\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest She\u2019s flipped... Adele and James Corden. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters\n\nProfessional Londoner Adele doesn\u2019t have much luck at award shows. At the 2012 Brits, while basking in the glory of single-handedly keeping the music industry afloat, her speech was interrupted by the host James Corden, who informed her they needed to cut to a performance by Blur. The irony of the show only running late because of Damon Albarn\u2019s earlier ramblings wasn\u2019t lost on the Cold Shoulder hitmaker as she promptly raised her middle finger. Then at the Grammys a year later, while collecting her award for best pop solo Performance, she was overshadowed by Ukrainian journalist Vitalii Sediuk who raced up to the podium ahead of her, attempted a speech and was subsequently shooed away by J-Lo. In fact, Sediuk has form; in 2011, at the Venice film festival, he handed Madonna a bunch of hydrangeas (\u201cI absolutely loathe hydrangeas\u201d she huffed, chucking them under a table), while in 2012 he was slapped by Will Smith after trying to kiss him at the Moscow premiere of Men in Black 3. The change.org petition to get Sediuk to host the Brits 2020 starts now.", "description": "Here are some of the best-worst moments involving opening envelopes", "authors": ["Michael Cragg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96d94b8b0e9ef66d14f1f3bb7ee7f6dc1a799538/0_12_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=63247324fe9b35938397310c88b93f49", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
