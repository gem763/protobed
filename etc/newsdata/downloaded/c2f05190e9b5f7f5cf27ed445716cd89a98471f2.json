The Reserve Bank of Australia admitted on Tuesday that record low interest rates might not be working as well as hoped.\n\nThe Washington-based IMF called on governments to use budget spending and structural reforms to lift economic growth.\n\n\"Monetary policy cannot be the only game in town. It should be coupled with fiscal support where fiscal space is available, and policy is not already too expansionary,\" the IMF said.\n\nMorrison won't risk budget surplus\n\nAmid added pressure from Labor and the RBA for the government to inject more infrastructure spending into the soft economy, Mr Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told the joint Coalition party room in separate addresses in Canberra on Tuesday that they would not risk the planned budget surplus this financial year.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison is holding the line against fiscal stimulus. AFR\n\nLater in question time, Mr Morrison said: \"It is a clear choice, as we have continued to demonstrate, and that is the sound, stable and certain policies ... not getting riled up, not getting spooked by the international conditions we are faced with, but ensuring we protect budget resilience that enables us to meet the challenges ahead.\n\n\"The shadow treasurer would have us blow the budget on reckless spending.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said Australia's economic growth was the second highest if compared to the major Group of Seven economies, and the government had helped create 1.4 million new jobs.\n\nLabor backs stimulus\n\nShadow treasurer Jim Chalmers said the IMF's substantial growth downgrade for Australia was worse than other major economies and he backed the IMF's call for fiscal stimulus via infrastructure spending to support the economy and improve productivity.\n\n\"The IMF\u2019s updated forecasts make a mockery of Josh Frydenberg\u2019s claims that the Morrison government has the right policy settings,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCollapsing confidence and weak growth are the inevitable consequence of a Liberal-National government which has a political strategy but not an economic policy.\n\n\u201cIt is time Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison brought forward a budget update to fix their forecasts and properly outline an economic plan that supports the floundering economy and better safeguards Australians from global turbulence.\u201d\n\nIn an implicit backing of the RBA's three interest rate cuts to a record-low 0.75 per cent this year, the IMF said that without the recent global monetary stimulus by central banks global growth would be lower by 0.5 of a percentage point in 2019 and 2020.\n\nRBA doubts\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the RBA admitted on Tuesday it was possible that low interest rates might be starting to have a \"negative effect on the income and confidence of savers\".\n\nMembers of the bank board noted in its October meeting minutes that \"policy stimulus might be less effective than past experience suggests\" and the usual stimulatory effect on borrowing or the construction industry \"may not be operating in the same way as in the past\".\n\nFurniture retailer Nick Scali said on Tuesday that store customer traffic had been down 10 to 15 per cent in the September quarter, forcing it to downgrade its half-year profit forecast to the range of $17 million to $19 million, compared to $25 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 2019.\n\nOne bright spot for Australia in the IMF report was the $US9.3 billion of gold production from 2016 to 2018, making it the world's second-largest producer with a 7 per cent share, behind China's 11 per cent.\n\nUS-China trade tensions\n\nIMF economic counsellor Gita Gopinath said the global economy was in a synchronised slowdown, forcing another downgrading of growth for 2019, to 3 per cent: \"Growth continues to be weakened by rising trade barriers and increasing geopolitical tensions.\n\n\"We estimate that the US-China trade tensions will cumulatively reduce the level of global GDP by 0.8 per cent by 2020. Growth is also being weighed down by country-specific factors in several emerging market economies, and structural forces \u2013 such as low productivity growth and ageing demographics in advanced economies.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina's growth is tipped to slip below 6 per cent, to 5.8 per cent, in 2020.\n\nThe IMF said the global car industry is contracting due to disruptions from new emission standards in the euro area and China.\n\nOverall, trade volume growth in the first half of 2019 has fallen to 1 per cent, the weakest level since 2012.\n\nThe IMF's latest report tips a modest improvement in global growth to 3.4 per cent in 2020, but still 0.2 of a percentage point lower than projected in April.\n\n\"However, unlike the synchronised slowdown, this recovery is not broad-based and remains precarious,\" Ms Gopinath said.\n\nLabour markets stronger\n\nDespite extremely weak manufacturing and trade, the services sector continues to hold up almost across the globe.\n\n\"This has kept labour markets buoyant and wage growth and consumption spending healthy in advanced economies. There are, however, some initial signs of softening in the services sector in the United States and euro area.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Frydenberg insisted the government's economic plan of a budget surplus, $300 billion of personal income tax cuts over a decade, $100 billion of infrastructure spending over 10 years, creating 80,000 new apprenticeships, cutting red tape and signing free trade deals was creating employment.\n\n\"Full-time jobs growth is now the strongest in 12 years and welfare dependency is at its lowest level in 30 years,\" Mr Frydenberg said.\n\nThe IMF noted advanced economies continue to slow towards their long-term trend.\n\nGrowth was downgraded to 1.7 per cent for 2019 and 2020, compared to 2.3 per cent in 2018.\n\n\"Strong labour market conditions and policy stimulus are helping to offset the negative impact from weaker external demand for these economies,\" the fund said.\n\nGrowth in emerging market and developing economies has also been revised down to 3.9 per cent for 2019, below the 4.5 per cent posted in 2018, due to trade and domestic policy uncertainties and a structural slowdown in China.", "description": "The IMF has slashed Australia's economic growth forecast to just 1.7 per cent and advised world governments to unleash a spending stimulus.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4125%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_54/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c7ebf17c22538ce5c56b7d1f5e2875c361dca664", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
