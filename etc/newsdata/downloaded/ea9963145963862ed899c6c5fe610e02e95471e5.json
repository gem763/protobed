Phoebodus was an ancient shark that lived around 370 million years ago. It resembled both the modern frilled shark and a fish, the gar, but was not related to either. It had an eel-like body that was around 4 feet long and a flat head. It likely ate small prey by grabbing hold on them in its jaws and then swallowing them whole. Until a skeleton was discovered in the mountains of Moroccan, the shark had only been known from the occasional tooth and dorsal spine fin.\n\nPalaeontologist Linda Frey of the University of Zurich and colleagues found the fossilised skeleton in the Ma\u00efder region of the Anti-Atlas Mountains, in Morocco.\n\nWhen Phoebodus was alive, around 370 million years ago in the so-called Devonian Period, this mountainous region would have instead been the basin of a shallow sea.\n\nAlongside the complete skeleton, the team also unearth several skulls of other individuals from the same species.\n\n'The nearly cosmopolitan and regionally abundant Devonian genus Phoebodus has long been known solely from isolated teeth and fin spines,' the researchers wrote.\n\n'Here, we report the first skeletal remains of Phoebodus from the Famennian (Late Devonian) of the Ma\u00efder region of Morocco.'\n\nThe team found that the fossil had an eel-like, 4 feet (1.2 metre) -long body, a flat skull, elongated jaws and spines just before both of its dorsal fins.\n\nPhoebodus would have likely born a strong resemblance to the modern frilled shark, the team said, and the gar fish, even though the species are not related.\n\n'Several of these features corroborate a likely close relationship with the Carboniferous species Thrinacodus gracia,' the researchers added.\n\nThe early Carboniferous Period \u2014 which began 358.9 million years ago \u2014 is when palaeontologists believe that Phoebodus went extinct.\n\nThis was long before its characteristic features evolved in modern sea creatures.\n\nWhen Phoebodus was alive, around 370 million years ago in the so-called Devonian Period, this mountainous region would have instead been the basin of a shallow sea. Alongside the complete skeleton, the team also unearth several skulls, as pictured\n\nLike the modern frilled shark, pictured, Phoebodus had round, pointed and inward-turning teeth, rather than ones with serrated edges. The two species, however, were not related\n\nLike the modern frilled shark, Phoebodus had round, pointed and inward-turning teeth, rather than ones with serrated edges.\n\nThis suggests that the shark would have hunted by grabbing onto small prey and then swallowing them whole.\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.", "description": "Palaeontologist Linda Frey of the University of Zurich and colleagues found the fossilised skeleton in the\u00a0Ma\u00efder region of the Anti-Atlas Mountains, in Morocco.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/12/19250700-0-image-a-11_1570103612276.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
