REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo\n\nThe Labour Party has moved sharply to the left under its leader Jeremy Corbyn, and although it lags the ruling Conservatives in opinion polls, Brexit turmoil and the likelihood of an early election could see it take power.\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry said Labour\u2019s plans would have an upfront cost of 196 billion pounds ($249 billion), assuming Labour paid the full market value of companies involved - similar to a 176 billion-pound estimate made last year by the pro-privatization Centre for Policy Studies think tank.\n\n\u201cThe price tag for Labour\u2019s renationalization plans is beyond eye-watering,\u201d CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.\n\n\u201cFirms want politicians to invest in major infrastructure projects rather than undermine confidence in our economy and waste time, energy and public money in a renationalization project with no clear benefits,\u201d she added.\n\nLabour described the CBI\u2019s estimate as \u201cincoherent scaremongering\u201d and said it overvalued the assets of utilities owned by privately held companies by applying a 30% premium to their book value.\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing that the CBI seems incapable of having a grown-up conversation about public ownership - which is hugely popular, and common across Europe,\u201d a party spokesperson said.\n\nJohn McDonnell, the Labour legislator most likely to become finance minister if the party wins an election, has said nationalization would be cost-neutral as the companies\u2019 profits would cover the cost of borrowing needed to finance it.\n\nThis view is broadly shared by the non-partisan Institute for Fiscal Studies, which said last week that focusing on the upfront cost of Labour\u2019s plans was the wrong approach.\n\n\u201cEconomically what matters is whether these assets would be better managed by the public or the private sector,\u201d it said.\n\nOpinion polls before the last national election in 2017 showed the public supported the type of nationalization proposed by Labour, despite the poor reputation some of the firms also held when they were last in public ownership.", "description": "A British employers' group criticized on Monday what it said would be the \"beyond eye-watering\" cost of the opposition Labour Party's plans to return utilities, train companies and the Royal Mail to public ownership.", "authors": ["David Milliken", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440527920&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0RP", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
