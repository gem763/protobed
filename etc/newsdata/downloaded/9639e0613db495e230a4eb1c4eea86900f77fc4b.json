(Submitted by Amanda Jett\u00e9 Knox, Viking)\n\nJett\u00e9 Knox said she knows she's made made mistakes along the way and said things to her wife that she regrets \u2014 comments she blames on \"that tug of the emotional side of me, versus the logical side.\"\n\nNevertheless, she decided to share those unflattering moments with readers.\n\n\"I put it in the book, as hard as it was and as much as I know people might judge me for it, because I want to show that love isn't perfect,\" she said.\n\nReality show offers\n\nJett\u00e9 Knox said her family has received several offers to be the subjects of reality shows \u2014 but unlike the book, it didn't feel like television producers wanted an authentic view into the life of a transgender family.\n\n\"These shows, they wouldn't further the conversation we felt. It was more just to gawk at, to look at and judge,\" she said. \"We didn't do this to get famous.\"\n\nBeing an outspoken advocate for her family and for transgender people more broadly has also drawn plenty of hate. Jett\u00e9 Knox said she ignores all the emails and social media attacks, because paying attention to them serves no purpose.\n\n\"Hate in a person burns out quickly. You can only shout and scream and hate a person for so long [before] you will get exhausted,\" she said.\n\n\"I have a great family there is a lot of love in our family and that is what keeps me going.\"\n\nShe's at University of Ottawa as part of their Pride Week celebrations and she's at Christ Church Cathedral on October 27th as part of the Ottawa International Writersfest. 12:40\n\nWith all the changes her family has gone through, the end result, Jett\u00e9 Knox said, is an openness and willingness to talk about anything.\n\n\"Having that honesty in the house, it just lifts everyone to a place where we can discuss everything,\" she said. \"I never feel alone anymore. I never feel like I have to keep things buried.\"\n\nJett\u00e9 Knox will be reading from Love Lives Here: A Story of Thriving In A Transgender Family on Oct. 27 at Christ Church Cathedral, as part of the Ottawa International Writers Festival.", "description": "Ottawa's Amanda Jett\u00e9 Knox's wife and daughter both came out as transgender.
