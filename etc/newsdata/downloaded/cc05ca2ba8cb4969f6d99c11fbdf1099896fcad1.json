The pungent smell of rotting eggs wafting from decomposing seaweed made him stop and put on his gas mask. It was a strange sight in what is usually a tourist hotspot.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be too careful,\u201d said the 74-year-old former gas technician, who is leading the fight against what has come to be known as France\u2019s coastal \u201ckiller slime\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 16, I used to bring a boat here with my uncle,\u201d Ollivro said. \u201cIn those days, it was all about natural beauty and you didn\u2019t see seaweed piled up. It\u2019s a shame this place has come to be associated with death.\u201d\n\nPhosphate fertiliser 'crisis' threatens world food supply Read more\n\nFor decades, potentially lethal green algae has amassed in shallow bays on Brittany\u2019s beautiful north-western coast. Environmentalists say the blossoming of unusually large amounts of green algae is linked to nitrates in fertilisers and waste from the region\u2019s intensive pig, poultry and dairy farming flowing into the river system and entering the sea. When the algae decomposes, pockets of toxic gas get trapped under its crust \u2014 potentially fatal to humans if they step on it.\n\n\u201cIt could kill you in seconds,\u201d Ollivro said, as he took out a gas reader to monitor levels for his environmental campaign group.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A woman on Grandville beach, which is covered with toxic green algae, in Hillion, near Saint-Brieuc.

The bay of Saint-Brieuc was the focus, with bulldozers piling so much algae into dumper trucks on the beach that an inland treatment centre, where seaweed is dried out and disposed of, briefly closed due to an unbearable stench. The centre blamed the foul odour on the method used to collect the algae, which had mixed in mud and sand. Local residents complained the smell was so bad it woke them up at night.\n\nThe row over algae intensified in July when the family of a man who died in the putrid seaweed sludge of the Gouessant estuary in 2016 sued the state and local authorities. The family said not enough was done to prevent the spread of seaweed and the public was not properly warned of the fatal danger.\n\nJean-Ren\u00e9 Auffray, 50, was fit and preparing for a long-distance race when he set out on an afternoon jog from his home near the beach in Hillion. His dog returned alone and his wife and children went out to search for him. The area where he was found had already seen over 30 wild boar die in sludge five years before, with a likely link to rotting seaweed. But Auffray\u2019s body was not immediately tested or autopsied until weeks later, too late to accurately measure the role of toxic gas.\n\n\u201cThe family don\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else again,\u201d said their lawyer, Fran\u00e7ois Lafforgue. \u201cFor years, the state has talked about measures to stop this algae spreading, yet year after year we see the situation getting worse, or not changing. So there\u2019s clearly a gap between the state\u2019s declarations and reality.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A dead wild boar lies in a cove in the bay of Saint-Brieuc in 2011.

Morfoisse died suddenly while he was driving a truck transporting algae away from a beach in 2009. The head of the French Green party, Yannick Jadot, recently accused the state of covering up the risks from the seaweed with \u201ccynicism and the law of omert\u00e0\u201d. He said the government was too keen to protect the food industry. Protesters have targeted industry giants rather than small farmers.\n\nIn the postwar period, Brittany became the centre of French industrial farming, with the intensive rearing of pigs and chickens, but also large-scale production of tomatoes and other produce. Brittany accounts for only a small percentage of the agricultural surface of France, but produces half the country\u2019s eggs, milk and meat. One in three people in Brittany work in the farming and food industry. The region has more pigs than people. Fears about seaweed blooming because of nitrates from intensive agriculture first surfaced in 1971.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Activists stand next to a placard reading \u2018Too many pigs kill local inhabitants\u2019 as they protest against toxic seaweed that covers the Valais beach in Saint-Brieuc.

L\u00e9raud, who spent three years living in a small local community, detailed the fight by a local doctor, Pierre Philippe, to raise the alarm over the fatal danger of the blooming seaweed after a 27-year-old vet was dragged unconscious from a patch of rotting algae a metre deep in 2009. The horse he was riding collapsed and died within minutes from fumes given off by the sludge on the beach.\n\n\u201cThere has been a wall of silence for several decades,\u201d L\u00e9raud said. \u201cAround 20 people die on the coast each year, often swept away with tides or currents, but the question is: could some of those people have fainted from toxic gas from seaweed before being swept out? The state has not shed full light on all these issues.\u201d\n\nHow to feed the world - without killing everything Read more\n\nThierry Burlot is deputy head of environment for the Brittany region and runs the only refuse centre processing seaweed collected on beaches. He said state initiatives had considerably reduced nitrates in the water system in recent years \u2013 levels in the bay of Saint-Brieuc had dropped by half. \u201cBrittany has around 2,700km of coastline, and less than 5% of it is affected by this algae phenomenon,\u201d he added. \u201cFifteen years ago, at the worst point, we would collect 30,000 tonnes of algae a year from certain beaches in the C\u00f4tes d\u2019Armor. Now it\u2019s 10,000 a year \u2026 We\u2019re mobilised to do more.\u201d\n\nSylvain Ballu, a scientist from Ceva, the local centre monitoring green algae, said the algae bloomed in specific shallow bays where light could penetrate. He said there were positive signs of nitrate levels going down, but there was no choice but to lower them further.\n\nWhat is the true cost of eating meat?

It has brought the issue to the surface.\u201d\n\nYves-Marie Le Lay, a former philosophy teacher campaigning against the seaweed in Brittany, has launched a petition for coastal deaths to be tested for links to toxic gas from algae. He carries a gas mask and gas monitors, and often tests beaches. \u201cFor too long, public powers have thought: business first, environment later,\u201d he said. \u201cNow more and more people are joining our fight.\u201d", "description": "Activists say stinking sludge is linked to nitrates in fertilisers from intensive farming", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a564a1b5e053f485df406c983d24130a271c9a2b/0_226_4921_2953/master/4921.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4a8f51b1021e93536571e6eaf3f1015a", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
