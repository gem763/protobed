He has found a healthy balance of work and training, as he hopes to start 2020 with a big win.\n\nFor more from Ige, click on the video linked above.", "description": "Dan Ige says he's facing a ranked opponent next, as he looks to put a number next to his name by early next year.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/dan-ige-dominance-media-day.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
