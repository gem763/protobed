A hacker could access the pin code to log in as the victim.\n\nA Holy See representative told Euronews that the \"Click to Pray\" application has been subject to at least three breaches since the launch, adding that the app developers had resolved each vulnerability \"in less than 24 hours\".\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fornos, director of the Pope's Worldwide Prayer Network, explained that the eRosary \"combines the best of Church tradition with the best of technology\".\n\nFornos also said the device was \"good for young people who seek to learn how to pray and who don't really know how to\" because it \"reminds them three times a day\".\n\nOnce connected to its application, the Rosary has specific content, such as thematic prayers, allowing fervent users to record and share their spiritual activity.\n\nBut the price is nothing to laugh at: developed in partnership with Korean GadgeTek, the eRosary is listed on the Italian website Acer for \u20ac99.\n\nMany have criticised the price, including Abbot Pierre Amar who is one of the authors of a French online blog run by priests. He denounced it as a scandal.", "description": "A new gadget aimed at getting more young people to pray has been hacked at least three times in the days since its launch.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/93/88/1000x563_cmsv2_f693b3f0-9f9f-5688-9e14-0f44de2d98fa-4259388.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
