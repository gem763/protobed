We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane Dorian will be felt across Alabama.\u201d\n\nSources told Business Insider that the president\u2019s advisers were particularly concerned about his refusal to acknowledge his claim was false.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
