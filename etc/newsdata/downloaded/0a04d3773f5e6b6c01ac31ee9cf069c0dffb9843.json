I think it will change the mood. The boys can go away on their international break and freshen up their heads,\u201d Solskjaer told Sky Sports ahead of the game.\n\n\u201cOf course you don\u2019t enjoy not winning games. You put your heart, life and soul into this job. If you win games you are happier, your mood changes but it doesn\u2019t mean your performances have been better \u2013 results change mood.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer however praised the fans for sticking with the side and assured them that the team is working hard to \u201cpay them back for their loyalty.\u201d\n\nThe Norwegian has previously acknowledged that his side are no longer the force they were during the trophy-laden years under former manager Alex Ferguson but has backed the new generation of players to build a brighter future.\n\nRyan Giggs, former teammate of Solskjaer\u2019s and a key cog of those successful teams, told Sky Sports that United needs multiple new players in order to get back to winning.\n\n\u201cThey need another four or five players. He (Solskjaer) has bought in three players but he probably needs seven or eight,\u201d Giggs, who is currently managing national side Wales said.\n\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t do that over one transfer window, so you have to be patient because it will be slow.\u201d\n\nThe 20-times English champions bought Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Harry Maguire and Daniel James during the summer transfer window.\n\n\u201cThe culture has changed and what he (Solskjaer) is trying to do was much needed. He needs time,\u201d Giggs said.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "A win for Manchester United in their next league game against Newcastle United on Sunday would be a huge morale boost for the squad ahead of the international break, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/olegunnarsolskjaer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
