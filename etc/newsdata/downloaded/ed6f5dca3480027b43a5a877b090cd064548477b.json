He was 96.\n\nHollywood's secret history: Scotty Bowers on sex and stars in the Golden Era Read more\n\nBowers claimed to have slept his way through golden-age Hollywood while helping huge stars both hide and indulge their true sexual natures. Among those he claimed to have \u201cschtupped\u201d were Cary Grant, Lana Turner, J Edgar Hoover and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.\n\nMedia outlets reported that Bowers died at his home in Laurel Canyon on Sunday.\n\nHe came to fame in his late 80s, in 2012, with the publication of an extraordinarily salacious memoir, Full Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Lives of the Stars.\n\nAmong notable claims that could have come hot from the pages of Hush-Hush, the 1950s scandal rag in James Ellroy\u2019s novels, Bowers said he had a threesome with Turner and Ava Gardner and had such loud sex with Vivien Leigh he might have woken the producer George Cukor in an adjoining room.\n\nHe also claimed both Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy were gay and their famous love affair was a studio-concocted cover story which he helped maintain, while providing same-sex partners for both stars. He said he slept with Tracy and provided \u201c150 girls\u201d to Hepburn.\n\nAs film historian David Thomson noted in his review for the Guardian, the subjects of Bowers\u2019 stories were all long dead. He also quoted Tracy biographer James Curtis, who wrote: \u201cBowers is full of glib stories and revelations, all cheerfully unverifiable.\u201d\n\nThomson pointed out that Curtis disputed whether Tracy was gay, but said he himself did believe Hepburn had \u201can active gay life\u201d.\n\nBowers was bisexual, or perhaps pansexual. He claimed to have slept with both Grant and Randolph Scott, long rumored to have been a couple in secret.\n\n\u201cThe three of us got into a lot of sexual mischief together,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said he paired off Grant with Rock Hudson and claimed to have had sex with Hoover, the formidable FBI director \u2013 \u201cHe was in drag\u201d \u2013 and the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson, \u201ca real ballsy chick\u201d.\n\nFull Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Lives of the Stars by Scotty Bowers \u2013 review Read more\n\nWhen a documentary, Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood, was released in 2018, director Matt Tyrnauer discussed how he followed up Bowers\u2019 stories, telling the Guardian: \u201cYou can wipe the dust off something that has been obscured and find the truth.\n\n\u201cScotty\u2019s a living example of that.
