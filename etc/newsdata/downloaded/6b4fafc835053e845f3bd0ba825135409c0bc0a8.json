The 28-year-old Jefferson was shot and killed, and Dean since has been charged with murder.\n\nIt's a terrible, heartbreaking situation for Jefferson's family, and Barnes sought to make things easier on them during these trying times by paying for her funeral.\n\nHarrison Barnes on he and his wife's decision to pay for the funeral of Atatiana Jefferson. pic.twitter.com/D9jQSMycOR \u2014 James Ham (@James_HamNBCS) October 17, 2019\n\n\"The biggest thing is, anytime someone has to go through that, the last thing you want to have to worry about is trying to come up with the money for a funeral,\" Barnes explained Thursday. \"It's about the family, it's about everything they're going through. Our prayers are obviously with them, and it was a gesture my wife and I wanted to do for them.\n\n\"It was unfortunate. It should never happen,\" Barnes continued. \"Just in general, gun violence in Dallas, recently. Andre Emmett, a guy that I played pickup basketball with for two-and-a-half straight summers -- another unfortunate incident. So when you see these type of situations continue to occur, you know that change needs to happen.\"\n\nBarnes understands that while he's a basketball player by profession, he has a role to play that goes beyond the court.\n\n[RELATED: Hield extension talks cast momentary dark cloud over Kings]\n\n\"I think that any time you come to a community, whether it's Sacramento, whether it's Dallas, whether it's Oakland, Chapel Hill or Ames, you always have a piece of that community that's with you and you always want to try to give back.\"\n\nKings' Harrison Barnes generously pays for Atatiana Jefferson's funeral originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "While Harrison Barnes is a basketball player by profession, he understands he has a role to play that goes beyond the court.", "authors": ["Brian Witt"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/urWcZib9GgSP3OM_VMDjUQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/596ac6c1dcce0eb7a3b679bc7ac6dbf7", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
