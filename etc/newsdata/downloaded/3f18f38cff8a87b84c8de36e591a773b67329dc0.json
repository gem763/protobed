Now we aren\u2019t even allowed to go to the loo.\n\n\u2018If any woman is wearing a onesie how are men going to react to her totally undressing to wee in a urinal?'\n\nThe theatre has insisted that doing away with facilities for ladies and gents will allow theatregoers 'to make their own decision about which loo is suitable for them'.\n\nBarber hit out on Twitter after The Old Vic said it will replace signs for men and women with pictures of a cubicle or a urinal as part of a major upgrade to the 201-year-old building\n\nThe Old Vic toilets in London's Waterloo which will be 'self-selection' gender neutral facilities\n\nIt said the \u00a34million refurbishment, which follows a trend across the UK to install gender-neutral facilities, are part of 'several years' work to transform the building.\n\nThe revamp of the Grade II-listed building has also created extra wheelchair access and two 'roomier' facilities for pregnant women and people with children.\n\nThe renovation comes two years after London Mayor Sadiq Khan called for more gender-neutral and accessible toilets to 'reflect the incredible diversity' of the city.\n\nA new cafe has also been installed with a 'key focus on ethical production and sustainability' and a pledge to be free from single-use plastic by early 2020.\n\nThe theatre also now has a gin and craft beer menu which has 'a focus on gender equality amongst suppliers'.\n\nThe Old Vic theatre has insisted that doing away with facilities for ladies and gents will allow theatregoers 'to make their own decision about which loo is suitable for them'\n\nExecutive director Kate Varah said: 'We set out to make changes to The Old Vic that were reflective of the needs of today's audiences and our local community.\n\n'An accessible front of house, new lift, 10 auditorium wheelchair spaces, double the loo provision, an additional bar, and an ethically produced sustainable range of food and wine on offer, all feel like significant steps towards securing The Old Vic's future as an artistic powerhouse and a vital civic resource.'\n\nThe theatre's artistic director Matthew Warchus, the successor to controversial actor Kevin Spacey, said the theatre is now 'radically different' and he hopes it won't be seen just for one 'famous figurehead'.\n\n'It is much more continuously alive and more adventurous,' he said. 'Hopefully the building itself is what people are paying attention to.'\n\nBarber, who has featured in productions for the National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company, is also known for her role in the Goal! football films.", "description": "The Olivier-nominated star hit out after The Old Vic in London said it will replace signs for men and women with pictures of a cubicle or a urinal as part of a major upgrade to the 201-year-old building.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline", "Susie Coen For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/13/19441554-0-image-a-29_1570537018446.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
