At the time, Bridenstine was frustrated that the company appeared to be spending a lot of time and energy on developing Starship, when it was behind on building the capsule to ferry NASA\u2019s astronauts to the International Space Station under what\u2019s known as the \u201ccommercial crew program.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Twitter, Bridenstine took a shot at the company, saying NASA \u201cexpects to see the same level of enthusiasm focused on the investments of the American taxpayer. It\u2019s time to deliver.\u201d\n\nIt was an unusual move for an administrator to call out a single company at a time when the agency has so many programs, including a massive rocket that NASA is building, suffering significant problems. But in an interview after the tour, Bridenstine said that he was confident now that SpaceX is focused on the task at hand.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think probably a couple of weeks ago we were not on the same page,\u201d he said of NASA and SpaceX. \u201cBut now we are 100 percent.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time Bridenstine was miffed by the company and its chief executive. Last year, he ordered a safety review of SpaceX and Boeing, the other company under contract to fly astronauts to the station. Those assessments, which are currently underway, were prompted by Musk\u2019s taking a puff of marijuana while appearing on a show broadcast on the Internet.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf I see something that\u2019s inappropriate, the key concern to me is what is the culture that led to that inappropriateness,\u201d he told The Post then. \u201cAs an agency, we\u2019re not just leading ourselves, but our contractors as well. We need to show the American public that when we put an astronaut on a rocket, they\u2019ll be safe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday, he said he was interested in making progress, not friends, and wouldn\u2019t mind ruffling feathers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that bonding with the CEO of a corporation that is a contractor to NASA is something I would be interested in doing now,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point I have a fiduciary responsibility to the American taxpayer.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, NASA awarded contracts, worth $6.8 billion combined, to SpaceX and Boeing to design spacecraft capable of flying astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nAD\n\nThe program has suffered a series of setbacks and delays \u2014 as well as restricted funding from Congress that has delayed the first flights, which were originally scheduled for 2017.\n\nAD\n\nLast year, during a test of its abort system, Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft suffered a propellant leak after four of eight valves failed to close properly. The investigation and remediation efforts resulted in a one-year delay, according to the Government Accountability Office.\n\nBoeing hopes to fly its capsule later this year in a test flight without humans, ahead of flights with crews sometime next year.\n\nSpaceX has already successfully completed its test flight without crews on board. But shortly after the flight, its Dragon capsule exploded as the company was testing the engines of its emergency abort system.\n\nTalking to reporters after the event, Musk said the company has fixed what caused the explosion and that the point of a development program was to discover problems before flying astronauts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a test program and nothing happens in that test program I would say it\u2019s insufficiently rigorous,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there hasn\u2019t been hardware that\u2019s blown up on a test stand, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve tested it hard enough. You\u2019ve got to push the envelope.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that the spacecraft that was destroyed was the same one that had successfully docked with the space station in the test flight. \u201cIf people had been on board,\u201d he said, \u201cthey would have returned safely.\u201d\n\nHe said that SpaceX is absolutely committed to making sure \u201cwe\u2019ve done everything possible to ensure the astronauts will be safe,\u201d Musk said. \u201cOnly at that point will we launch.\u201d And he said that developing the Dragon spacecraft \u201cis absolutely the overwhelming priority\u201d and that the company has \u201ca lot of people\u201d working super hard\u201d to make it happen.\n\nStill, it\u2019s clear the company has a ways to go before that day. It\u2019s working on a new parachute design that will have to undergo more testing. It also has to test the spacecraft\u2019s emergency abort system during a launch.\n\nIn the end, Bridenstine said he has confidence in the company.\n\n\u201cWe will make it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a big deal for our country. We can\u2019t get it wrong.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine stopped by SpaceX\u2019s headquarters here Thursday.
