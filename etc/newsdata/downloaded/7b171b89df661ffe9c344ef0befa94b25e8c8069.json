Russian spy services have a long history of doing this.\"\n\nMedical information, like personal data, can also be easily monetised on criminal forums, said Sanjay Aurora, Asia-Pacific managing director of Darktrace.\n\n\"Beyond making a quick buck, a more sinister reason to attack would be to cause widespread disruption and systemic damage to the healthcare service - as a fundamental part of critical infrastructure - or to undermine trust in a nation's competency to keep personal data safe,\" he told AFP.\n\nHyper-connected\n\nToday, cybercriminals are targeting more than just individuals or banks, said Shahnawaz Backer, regional security specialist at F5 Networks.\n\n\"Government services, from healthcare to education, are targets that are just as likely, as evidenced by the recent attacks in Singapore,\" Backer said.\n\n\"As Singapore embraces the digital revolution, security breaches are bound to happen. Our growing digital footprint is growing every day, and enterprises need to take strict measures to safeguard and protect their data.\"\n\nWealthy Singapore is hyper-connected and on a drive to digitise government records and essential services, including medical records which public hospitals and clinics can share via a centralised database.\n\nBut authorities have put the brakes on these plans while they investigate the breach. A former judge will head an inquiry looking into the hack.\n\nSingapore officials have cautioned against jumping to conclusions about the attackers.\n\n\"With regard to the prime minister's data and why he was targeted, I would say that it's perhaps best not to speculate what the attacker had in mind,\" said David Koh, head of Singapore's Cyber Security Agency.\n\nThe hackers used a computer infected with malware to gain access to the database between June 27 and July 4 before administrators spotted \"unusual activity\", authorities said.\n\nThe government says it fends off thousands of cyberattacks every day and has long warned of breaches by actors as varied as high-school students in their bedrooms to nation-states.\n\nEarlier this month, US intelligence chief Dan Coats described Russia, China, Iran and North Korea as the \"worst offenders\" when it came to attacks on American \"digital infrastructure\".\n\n* SUBSCRIBE FOR FREE UPDATE: Get Fin24's top morning business news and opinions in your inbox.", "description": "State-actors were likely behind Singapore's biggest ever cyberattack to date, security experts say, citing the scale and sophistication of the hack which hit medical data of about a quarter of the population.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5247/723fa77f8e5f417fa246d21e47b0b448.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-22"}
