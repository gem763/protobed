For all he knew, Valtteri could have been in the middle of the circuit. It\u2019s not great. The flags normally mean, \u2018Slow the f--- down.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven with Bottas\u2019 travails, the odds remain stacked against Hamilton.\n\nFor the past three years, Mercedes have struggled in Mexico more than at any other track, with the high altitude severely diminishing their cars\u2019 downforce.\n\nHamilton still faces a considerable battle to reel in Charles Leclerc, now upgraded to pole, and Sebastian Vettel, such is the Ferraris\u2019 superior straight-line speed.\n\nIt was but the latest twist in a weekend of intrigue.\n\nIt also emerged that Hamilton would all but certainly end his career at Mercedes, with Wolff indicating that the five-time world champion would spurn a move to Ferrari in favour of signing a final contract at the Silver Arrows.\n\nWhile Hamilton has a \u00a340 million-a-year deal that keeps him a Mercedes driver until the end of next year, the prospect of radical regulation changes in 2021 \u2013 not to mention a strict budget cap that would limit all teams to a maximum \u00a3125 million annual spend \u2013 has raised the temptation of a final chapter at Maranello.\n\nBut Wolff appeared to scotch the Ferrari links altogether. \u201cI think that this Ferrari thing has maybe been blown out of proportion,\u201d he said. \u201cLewis has a clear opinion on where he sees himself in the future, and we are and have always been very loyal to our drivers. In 2021, everything is different, but ultimately the cars\u2019 performance is what counts most for the top guys. These discussions have slowly but surely started.\u201d\u200b\n\nFinal Positions after Qualifying:", "description": "Lewis Hamilton received an unexpected fillip in his quest to seal a sixth world title at Sunday\u2019s Mexican Grand Prix after Max Verstappen was stripped of pole position for failing to slow down under double yellow flags.", "authors": ["Oliver Brown", "Luke Slater", "Chief Sports Feature Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/formula-1/2019/10/26/TELEMMGLPICT000214246557-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqoQmI6CCYeWXI2SDtPW01M0MJNw-HbsNNHOJzGAUpl-4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
