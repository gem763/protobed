The $51.6 billion cash pile at the end of the June, which was bigger than South Africa\u2019s foreign currency reserves, has been growing for most of the three-decade reign of General Director Vladimir Bogdanov.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard two versions about what is driving Surgutneftegas,\u201d BCS analyst Sergey Suverov said. \u201cFirst, it could be a merger with Lukoil or, second, a change in the dividend policy that will devote part of the cash pile to boosting dividends.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s ordinary shares climbed 7.7% to 46.92 rubles at 3:40 p.m. in Moscow, bringing the gain this week to 30%. The stock enjoyed a similar surge in early September, which also went unexplained.\n\nA spokesman for Surgutneftegas said the company doesn\u2019t comment on speculation. A spokeswoman for Lukoil denied a deal was in the works.\n\nWhile Surgutneftegas is publicly traded, the identity of who really controls the company is subject to much speculation. Its Byzantine shareholding structure is such that more than 75% of the company at the end of 2016 was controlled by about two dozen firms with interlocking ownership that are all registered in the Siberian city of Surgut, where the firm\u2019s main oil assets are located. None of them have more than 5%, meaning the company doesn\u2019t need to disclose their names.\n\nDespite the strong returns this year, some asset managers are content remaining on the sidelines.\n\n\u201cSurgutneftegas is a very difficult one for us to invest in I would say, because some people would wonder whether it\u2019s an operating company,\u201d James Donald of Lazard Asset Management said by phone. \u201cSurgutneftegas is this company with a huge amount of cash controlled by one individual, who doesn\u2019t really like to see investors.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Dina Khrennikova and \u00c1ine Quinn.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jake Rudnitsky in Moscow at jrudnitsky@bloomberg.net;Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Torrey Clark at tclark8@bloomberg.net, Phil Serafino, Tom Lavell\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Shares in Russia\u2019s most secretive major company have soared by almost one-third this week, sending the market into a frenzy for a plausible explanation for the gains.Some analysts are speculating that Surgutneftegas PJSC, Russia\u2019s fourth-largest oil producer, will finally put to work some", "authors": ["Jake Rudnitsky", "Irina Reznik"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4GW7racsCb5cCCDGudDhgw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/13f853415ba701954e0811e4714fcf00", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
