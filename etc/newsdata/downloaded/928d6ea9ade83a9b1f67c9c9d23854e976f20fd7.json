Aortic valve regurgitation \u2014 or aortic regurgitation \u2014 is a condition that occurs when the heart's aortic valve doesn't close tightly. Aortic valve regurgitation allows some of the blood that was just pumped out of the heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle) to leak back into it. The leakage may prevent your heart from efficiently pumping blood to the rest of your body. As a result, people may feel fatigued and short of breath. Aortic valve regurgitation can develop suddenly or over decades. Once aortic valve regurgitation becomes severe, surgery is often required to repair or replace the aortic valve. Source: Mayo Clinic\n\nThe rare condition, for which hypertension is a known risk factor, occurs when the aortic valve which sits between the two heart chambers doesn't close tightly.\n\nThis then allows blood to leak back into the heart's pumping chamber in the wrong direction.\n\nIt prevents the heart from efficiently pumping blood to the rest of the body, causing shortness of breathe and fatigue.\n\nIn the most severe cases, it can cause Landolfi's sign. The prevalence of the sign, first described by Michel Landolfi in 1909, is unknown.\n\nLandolfi's sign causes a change of blood flow to the iris, the coloured part of the eye which controls the pupil with tiny muscles.\n\nAn array of medicines, injuries and diseases can cause the pupils to dilate or contract without any change in light.\n\nFor example, brain injuries can cause dilated or 'big' pupils, while blood pressure pills, such as clonidine and tetrahydrozoline, or opioids, such as coedine and morphine, can cause the pupils to become 'pin points'.\n\nDr Jorge Aceituno wrote: 'The patient underwent replacement of his ascending aorta and aortic valve.\n\n'On discharge ten days later, Landolfi\u2019s sign was no longer present.'\n\nWithout treatment, severe aortic valve diseases are likely to get worse and may eventually be fatal, the NHS say.\n\nAround 7.4million people in the UK live with heart and circulatory disease.\n\nIn the US, more than five million Americans are diagnosed with heart valve disease each year.", "description": "The unnamed 73-year-old man, from Mexico, was diagnosed with Landolfi's sign, which was caused by a severe heart condition called aortic regurgitation.", "authors": ["Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/08/19384658-0-image-a-6_1570435117011.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
