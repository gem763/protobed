The BTC/USD pair followed a bearish path and broke the $8,200 support area. Moreover, there was a close below the $8,200 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The last swing high was formed near $8,300 before the price broke $8,200 support.\n\nAdditionally, there was a break below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $7,659 low to $8,539 high. The recent decline was such that the price tested the $8,000 support area. More importantly, the price tested the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $7,659 low to $8,539 high. At the moment, the price is struggling to hold the $8,000 support area.\n\nIt seems like there is a key declining channel forming with resistance near the $8,260 level on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Thus, if there is a downside break below the $8,000 support, the price could accelerate its decline towards the $7,800 support area. Besides, an intermediate support is near $7,850 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $7,659 low to $8,539 high.\n\nOn the upside, there is a solid resistance forming near the $8,250 level and the 100 hourly SMA. Therefore, if there is an upside break above $8,250 and $8,300, the price could trade towards the main $8,500 resistance level in the near term.\n\nLooking at the chart, bitcoin is clearly struggling to climb above the $8,300 level. Therefore, there is a risk of a downside break below the $8,000 support. In the mentioned case, the price could test the $7,800 support or trade to a new monthly low before it starts a decent recovery towards $9,000.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD is slowly gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for BTC/USD is currently well below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $8,000 followed by $7,800.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $8,250, $8,300 and $8,500.", "description": "Bitcoin price is struggling to hold the key $8,000 support against the US Dollar.
