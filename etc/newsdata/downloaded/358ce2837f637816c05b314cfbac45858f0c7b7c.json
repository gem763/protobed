He\u2019s an Iowa man who held up a funny sign on ESPN College Gameday that asked for people to Venmo him money so he could buy beer. Well, people obliged and instead of keeping the money for himself, he said he would donate all of it (except for 1 case of beer) to the University of Iowa\u2019s Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital:\n\nWith all the donations my @CollegeGameDay sign for @BuschBeer has received, I will be donating all but enough for a case of Busch Light to @uiowa Children\u2019s Hospital. We\u2019re at over $1,600.00 right now! @CycloneATH @WideRtNattyLt @ChrisMWilliams Venmo Carson-King-25 \u2014 Carson King (@CarsonKing2) September 14, 2019\n\nHe\u2019s raised over $1 million so far for the hospital:\n\nKid With \"Busch Light Supply Needs Replenished: Venmo @ Carson-King-25\" Sign On College Gameday Gets Over ONE MILLION DOLLARS \u2013 Gives All Of It (Except For 1 Case Of Busch Light) To Children's Hospitalhttps://t.co/sin8tEMNPn pic.twitter.com/jU6kUA0kMY \u2014 Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) September 24, 2019\n\nA hero, right?\n\nWe can\u2019t think\u2014our minds are blown by all of this! \ud83e\udd2f Thank you to everyone who helped reach this milestone! We\u2019re so grateful! \ud83d\udc9b \u2014 UI Stead Family Children's Hospital (@UIchildrens) September 22, 2019\n\nWrong! Here comes the milkshake ducking via Des Moines Register reporter Aaron Calvin who dug up a few old tweets from when King was 16-years-old. From the Washington Post:\n\nKing\u2019s social media missteps came to light after Calvin, a trending news reporter at the Register, delved far back into the casino security guard\u2019s old tweets. Calvin discovered two 2012 tweets, written when King was in high school, that the Register described as \u201cracist jokes, one comparing black mothers to gorillas and another making light of black people killed in the holocaust.\u201d When Calvin asked King about the tweets, he told the reporter seeing them made him feel \u201csick.\u201d\n\nWTF, Des Moines Register? Why do this?\n\n\u201cHey, this Carson King guy raised $1 million for a children\u2019s hospital. Let\u2019s see if we can find anything bad he might have posted as a teenager and spoil this kindness for everyone!\u201d Seriously, what is wrong w people? Who does this? Who thinks this way? Get a life. \u2014 Carol Roth (@caroljsroth) September 25, 2019\n\nWhy https://t.co/mbLjpR0TSj thought Carson King needed a \"routine\" social media check going back 8 years because of his generosity is beyond me. If you're bored at work, find a story. Don't try to ruin people. \u2014 Jessica Fletcher (@heckyessica) September 25, 2019\n\nNobody can seem to even find the tweets that were so offensive, but \u201cit literally doesn\u2019t matter. This is a war\u201d:\n\nI spent a few minutes trying to find the \u201coffensive tweets\u201d that got Anheuser-Busch to drop King, and I can\u2019t find them. And you know what? It doesn\u2019t matter. It literally doesn\u2019t matter. This is a war. https://t.co/SkE4LUegMf \u2014 Andrew Kloster (@ARKloster) September 25, 2019\n\nEven worse? Anheuser-Busch cut ties with King over it:\n\nBREAKING \u2014 Anheuser-Busch to cut ties with Carson King over multiple offensive social media posts https://t.co/mICVWN9L7S pic.twitter.com/AowgwP5m5o \u2014 KCCI News (@KCCINews) September 25, 2019\n\nBad move, crappy beer company. Bad move:\n\nDo you believe Anheuser-Busch was right in disassociating from GameDay/Children\u2019s Hospital fundraiser Carson King for distasteful tweets written eight years ago, and unearthed by the Des Moines Register today? \u2014 Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) September 25, 2019\n\nKing has since apologized:\n\nThe Des Moines Register has been nothing but kind in all of their coverage, and I appreciate the reporter pointing out the post to me. I want everyone to understand that this was my decision to publicly address the posts and apologize. I believe that is the right thing to do. \u2014 Carson King (@CarsonKing2) September 25, 2019\n\nNow for the \u201ccowardly part.\u201d The DMR reporter who unearthed the tweets from the local hero has now made his account private after his own vile tweets were uncovered:\n\nIf Carson King had been defiant about the two tweets from when he was 16 or doubled down, I would get why the Register would mention them but according the paper, he was deeply remorseful. I fail to see how it was newsworthy, especially given the good work he\u2019s been doing \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) September 25, 2019\n\n2. With respect to this story, the Register and the reporter @aaronpcalvin don\u2019t deserve this level of kindness but here we are. https://t.co/UQm4NrL7t1 \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) September 25, 2019\n\n3. What a hypocritical disgrace. https://t.co/MgoYZLYOJh \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) September 25, 2019\n\n4. If you\u2019re going to pull up someone\u2019s old tweets, write about them, and you have old racist tweets of your own, at least have the courage to take the heat, @aaronpcalvin. Taking your account private is cowardly. pic.twitter.com/SdCEfg1A6Q \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) September 25, 2019\n\nBut we have screenshots:\n\n\u2013 \"I want to grow up and read sex scenes to high schoolers.\" \u2013 \"can I be a guest instructor at your theater camp teaching the kids how to abuse substances and 'turn tricks.'\u201d Both quotes from Aaron Calvin. #CarsonKing https://t.co/8SbIDJhn0x \u2014 Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) September 25, 2019\n\nA Des Moines Register reporter digs up tweets of a 16 year old Carson King \u2013 the dude who raised $1 million+ for child cancer \u2013 and prepares to expose him.
