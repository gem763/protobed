That is well known. And nearly three million deployed since 9/11, so what is the impact of this combat?\u201d Cesur asked. \u201cWe wanted to know if it was driven by combat or by some other selection factor. For example, are people who are prone to opioid abuse drawn to enlist? ... Our evidence shows strong evidence that the reason why so many military people are using opiates is because they are exposed to combat.\u201d\n\nCesar noted about a third of opioid abuse among the military and veteran communities stems from injuries suffered during war. Nearly 58 percent of heroin abuse was also linked to war injury, they found.\n\nOPIOID DOCTORS WARNED AGAINST ABRUPTLY ENDING TREATMENT FOR PAIN PATIENTS\n\nMany veterans have been prescribed opioids upon being discharged from a hospital and many continued to take them for a prolonged period, the study concluded.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs reported in 2015 that it saw a 55 percent rise in opioid use among Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans, according to the Times. Between 2010 and 2016, nearly 6,500 hundred veterans in the VA health care system died of opioid-related causes.\n\nIn fiscal year 2016, the VA reported treating around 68,000 veterans for opioid addiction.\n\nAmong active military members, The Army and Marine Corps had the highest rates of heroin use, followed by the Navy and Air Force. However, drug use in the military is still relatively rare.\n\nThe study comes at a time when many opioid manufacturers are facing scrutiny over their role in exacerbating the opioid epidemic that has killed thousands and ravaged communities. Multiple states and communities are suing Purdue Pharma -- maker of OxyContin -- over the pharmaceutical giant's aggressive marketing model for drugs that netted the company billions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn a positive note, the study's researchers said pain medication prescriptions, opioid-related hospitalization stays and age-adjusted opioid death rates dropped in states where medical marijuana is legal, the Times reported.\n\n\u201cWhile marijuana legalization is certainly not a silver bullet, evidence that marijuana and opioids are substitutes suggests that access to medical marijuana may provide an alternative, less addictive, and less unhealthy means of treating pain,\u201d they wrote.", "description": "American troops exposed to combat face a higher risk of abusing heroin and prescription opioids than service members who\u00a0weren't according to a paper published last month by the\u00a0National Bureau of Economic Research.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/MIlitary-and-Opioid-crisis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
