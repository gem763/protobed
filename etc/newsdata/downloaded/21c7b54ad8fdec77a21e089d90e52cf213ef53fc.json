However, it does call into question how effective the Australian government's tax reforms have been in getting digital companies like Netflix, Google and Facebook to recognise the money they earn from Australian consumers and businesses in Australia.\n\nNetflix Australia acts as a collection, payment processing and content delivery support business. It charges a fee to Netflix International BV for those services.\n\nNetflix International BV paid Netflix Australia a service fee of $12.1 million in 2018, up from $6.5 million in 2017, forming all its locally recognised revenue, according to documents filed with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. It recorded a profit of $400,129 in 2018, compared with $255,988 in 2017.\n\nTax experts believe the argument Netflix would make for these financial accounts is subscription revenue is earned by a non-resident and is non-Australian sourced income. Until 2019, Netflix barely had a physical presence in Australia.\n\nHowever, it has now opened its first office locally and made a number of hires, including former Ausfilm chief executive Debra Richards as head of production policy across the Asia-Pacific, former Seven executive Nick O'Donnell as director of public policy, and poached two former Twitter team members in Tony Broderick as head of brand and editorial and Nathan Burman as head of communications.\n\nA larger local presence may have implications for how Netflix recognises its 2019 revenue in Australia.\n\nAs of December 31, Netflix Australia was still holding onto $21.6 million in revenue it had collected from Australian consumers on behalf of Netflix International BV. Netflix previously confirmed to the Financial Review that Netflix Australia collects more than $100 million from local customers on behalf of Netflix International BV, but it does not recognise that revenue in Australia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetflix International BV pays GST to the Australian Taxation Office for revenue collected in Australia, however that is not recorded in Netflix Australia's accounts.\n\nIt is unclear just how much revenue Netflix International BV receives from Australian consumers as the streaming giant does not disclose Australian subscriber numbers.\n\nAMPD Research, a subsidiary of Media Partners Asia, believes Netflix has 5.3 million subscribers in Australia following a June consumer survey.\n\nNetflix has three tiers for its streaming service; $9.99 for basic, $13.99 for standard and $19.99 for premium. However, Netflix only increased the price of its premium tier earlier in October from $17.99.\n\nFactoring in the financial accounts are for 2018, based on AMPD's research, Netflix could be earning anywhere between $600 million and more than $1 billion in revenue from Australian subscribers. Netflix's subscriber base will also include non-paying customers on free trials and those who have signed up via a third party, such as Telstra, Optus or Vodafone, which have a lower fee which makes it to Netflix.\n\nNine, publisher of the Financial Review, owns subscription video on-demand service Stan, a local rival to Netflix.", "description": "Netflix Australia has doubled the amount of tax it pays in Australia, but it is still a drop in the ocean compared to its estimated earnings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3125%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_39/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/43eaa5624bc3b22f44dfa29b60620b8059b349e5", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
