The two sides announced a limited agreement, though it must still be written and signed in the coming weeks.\n\nTrump has claimed that Hunter Biden got $1.5 billion from China and alleged it is evidence of corruption involving the former vice president. Hunter Biden has business connections to China, but there is no evidence of how much he's made or that it had any relation to his father's work.\n\nTrump last week told reporters that China should investigate Hunter and Joe Biden over unsubstantiated allegations of corruption.
