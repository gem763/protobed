unite right at Rome rally", "language": "en", "text": "Rome (AFP) \u2013 Italy\u2019s former firebrand interior minister Matteo Salvini held a mass rally in Rome on Saturday which he hopes will propel him to leadership of the country\u2019s disparate right-wing parties.\n\nA crowd of over 100,000 people thronged the Rome piazza, ferried in from around the country by eight special trains and 400 coaches for the \u201cItalian Pride\u201d demonstration.\n\n\u201cWe were right to abandon this government,\u201d the head of the far-right League party thundered, after speeches by a string of far-right leaders as well as billionaire former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.\n\nThe anti-migrant Salvini pulled support from the previous populist government over the summer in a bid to spark elections he was convinced he could win to govern the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy alone.\n\n\u2013 Popularity blip \u2013\n\nThat plan failed when his former coalition partner, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, sealed a deal with the centre-left Democratic Party to form a new, pro-European government.\n\nAfter suffering a blip, the League\u2019s popularity has risen slightly again in the opposition role Salvini is more used to.\n\n\u201cI want to live in a free country, where you can govern without waiting for a phone call from (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel or (French President Emmanuel) Macron,\u201d the eurosceptic Salvini said.\n\nRecent opinion polls put the anti-immigration party at between 30 to 33 percent of voter intentions, well ahead of the Five Star (M5S) and Democratic Party (PD), which have dropped slightly to between 18 and 20 percent each.\n\nWith the current left-leaning government seeking to change the electoral law to prevent Salvini triumphing alone at the next elections, the 46-year-old hopes to unite parties on the right and centre-right under his leadership.\n\nThat, however, will not be an easy task.\n\nForza Italia head Berlusconi, 83, whose party has been in a lengthy slump, appears open to just such an alliance, along with the smaller, far-right Brothers of Italy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here in this piazza because we have a big responsibility, to answer our people\u2019s call for unity,\u201d Berlusconi said, attacking the current government as \u201cthe most left-wing\u201d since the war.\n\nBrothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni, who had earlier complained that only League banners were visible on the podium, vowed to fight what she called \u201cthe Islamisation of Europe\u201d.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s fight this battle together beyond the confines of individual parties, without selfishness and we will be unstoppable,\u201d Meloni said.\n\nSome Forza Italia members had voiced unhappiness about the presence of neo-fascist party CasaPound at the rally.\n\nSalvini in August had refuted the idea of a tie-up with Forza Italia, saying the League \u201cneeds nothing and no-one\u201d, but on Saturday he reversed course and appealed for unity.\n\n\u201cI would like that, since the team always wins and never alone, the embrace of this square should also go to Giorgia Meloni and Silvio Berlusconi, because together we win,\u201d Salvini said after his speech.\n\n\u2013 City needs love \u2013\n\nPolitical analysts say Salvini has set his sights on taking Rome and hopes the right-wing alliance could carry him to victory in key upcoming regional elections, potentially setting him up for a win on a national level.\n\n\u201cNow there\u2019s only one thing to do, go to the polls because we other Italians, we citizens have the right to vote,\u201d League supporter Marco Diurno, 58, told AFP.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope that Salvini returns us to an Italy of dignity.\u201d\n\nThe next general election is not due until 2023, but the current governing coalition of former foes is shaky and might not last.\n\nSalvini has waged war on Rome\u2019s mayor, M5S member Virginia Raggi, calling for her resignation, and has launched a petition demanding she step down now, two years before her term is due to end.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Hands off Rome\u2019 \u2013\n\nRaggi, 41, has come under intense fire for the city\u2019s ongoing garbage crisis and beleaguered transport services, which have existed for decades.\n\nShe has blamed the problems on organised crime and corruption in previous administrations.\n\n\u201cToday we still hear many politicians who have miraculous recipes for Rome and for Italy, politicians who have governed in the previous decades,\u201d Raggi said after the right-wing rally.\n\n\u201cIf you have all these recipes why didn\u2019t you apply them when you were governing?\u201d she asked on Facebook.",
