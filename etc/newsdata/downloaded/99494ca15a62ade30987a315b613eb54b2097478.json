So, as Kurds, we are not happy about it.\n\nMr Maarof from South Kurdistan said he agreed with Boris Johnson, who this week urged President Erdogan to end the military assault but that more action was needed from the British Government.\n\n'The world does owe the Kurdish now for what they did in Syria. If you really mean it, the British should stop selling Turkey weapons, because last year Theresa May gave them planes and now they are using them against us.\n\n'The whole world is watching and no-one is saying anything.\n\n'We, the Kurdish, are upset, not only with Turkey but with most of the world, because we are not being helped.'\n\nProtesters (pictured) chanted 'wake up UK, Turkish state is Isis' and set off coloured smoke as the march made its way through central London towards Parliament Square\n\nKurdish protest marchers are pictured in BBC Portland Place as they demonstrate against the Turkish invasion of Rojava\n\nOne woman waves a Kurdish flag during the protest (left) while another carries a large placard as they voice their opposition to Turkey's invasion of northern Syria\n\nMore than 130,000 people have been displaced from rural areas around the northeast Syrian border towns of Tel Abyad (pictured today) and Ras al Ain as a result of fighting between Turkish-led forces and Kurdish militia\n\nThe protest (pictured) came as Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said on Sunday Turkey-backed forces in northern Syria had 'near full control' of border town Tal Abyad\n\nDressed in a full Kurdistan tracksuit and a matching hat, Bokurd Kurdo, 29, said that the Kurdish people had been abandoned by the rest of the world.\n\nSpeaking to PA, he said: 'We have come today to protest against the Turkish enemy in Kurdistan, because they are killing us and nobody is saying anything.\n\n'All the humanity in the world is silent.\n\n'I don't know when the silence will be broken.\n\n'We were fighting Isis and terrorism, but when that was finished everyone left us.\n\n'That is why we are protesting today. We are Kurd, we have no country, we need space and we need peace.'\n\nHavel Surchi, 33, said that he was 'disappointed' at the way the Kurdish people had been treated.\n\n'Our people are dying in Syria, so today we are supporting our people. We are disappointed with the United States, they left us behind.\n\n'It is embarrassing for America, for Trump especially, what he did to us, he left us behind.\n\n'We love Kurdish people, today we give love to people who died in Syria. It is a shame, I'm disappointed.'\n\nMr Surchi, originally from northern Iraq, took part in the march on Sunday afternoon, which saw hundreds of people travel from Broadcasting House to right outside Parliament.\n\nPeople take part in a pro-Kurdish rally and hold a banner reading 'stronger together' as they march on Westminster on Sunday\n\nA demonstrator holds a flag during the pro-Kurdish rally against Turkey's military action in northeastern Syria, in London, on Sunday\n\nNiaz Maarof, 41, a driver from London, was part of the march (pictured) and said the Kurdish community was opposed to the Turkish military presence in northern Syria\n\nProtesters chanted 'wake up UK, Turkish state is Isis' and set off coloured smoke as the march made its way through central London towards Parliament Square.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said on Sunday Turkey-backed forces in northern Syria had 'near full control' of border town Tal Abyad.\n\nSporadic gunfire and an occasional mortar round could still be heard hitting Tal Abyad from just across the border in the Turkish town of Akcakale.\n\nThere were some celebrations in Akcakale, with people waving Turkish flags.\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian rebel fighters sit in a military tank in the village of Yabisa, near the Turkish-Syrian border, on Sunday\n\nSyrian rebel fighters ride on a truck mounted with a weapon in the village of Yabisa, near the Turkish-Syrian border, on Sunday\n\nThe Turkish government views the Syrian Kurdish fighters as terrorists because of their links to an insurgency in southeast Turkey.\n\nBut those same Syrian Kurdish forces were a key US ally in the war against the Islamic State group.\n\nTurkey has vowed to carve out a 'safe zone' inside Syria along the border.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said earlier 17 villages around Tal Abyad had also been captured.\n\nThe Syrian Kurdish fighters had themselves captured the town from IS in 2015.", "description": "Demonstrations (pictured on Regent Street today) began at the BBC's Broadcasting House at around 12.30pm against the continued Turkish military presence in Rojava, in northern Syria.", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/16/19658938-0-image-a-52_1570980712387.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
