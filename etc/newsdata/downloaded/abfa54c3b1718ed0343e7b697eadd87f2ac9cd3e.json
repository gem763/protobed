Like I didn't want it to be that close again, but I think it was close again today.\"\n\nOsaka's debut at the year-end final last year in Singapore ended in disappointment when she lost all three of her round-robin encounters.\n\nThe 29-year-old Kvitova, the oldest player in this year's eight-player field, is competing in her seventh WTA Finals. She won the year-end title in her first appearance in 2011, and was also a finalist in 2015.\n\nThe standings in the Red Group have Barty and Osaka at 1-0, and Bencic and Kvitova at 0-1 after the first day of action.\n\nPurple Group games will be played on Monday with Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic playing defending champion Elina Svitolina of Ukraine, and reigning U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu of Canada playing reigning Wimbledon champion Simona Halep of Romania.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
