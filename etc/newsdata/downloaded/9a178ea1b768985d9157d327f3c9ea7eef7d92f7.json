The bank\u2019s technology team raised it again in September 2014. A processing error from the bank\u2019s data processing plant in Bangalore was also discovered in September 2016.\n\nDuring her evidence, Ms Stubbings said the bank had in fact just discovered a new cohort of customers who were not captured in the original compensation process while preparing for the year-long hearings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt's not so much a further issue arose,\u201d Ms Stubbings said, \u201cWe identified that it did not pick up customers who had closed their accounts between January 2013 and January 2016.\"\n\nCounsel assisting the commissioner Albert Dinelli attacked the bank for taking 10 years to refund customers who were affected by a problem that occurred in 2003.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not good enough, is it? To have an issue that\u2019s only capable of being resolved after that period of time for customers?\u201d Mr Dinelli said.\n\nANZ is due to report full year results on Thursday October 31.", "description": "ANZ is still in the process of finding, fixing and remediating customers for a problem it first discovered in 2011.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6263%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_679%2C$y_215/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/25924e13d5ecb1072fe8d6fb5f2ec010e65eff8a", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
