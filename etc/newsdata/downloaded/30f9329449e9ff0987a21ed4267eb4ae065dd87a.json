The concern has sparked conversations in the education sector that lead to schools to take initiative to start school at a later time.\n\nHowever, recently, a different kind of complaint about school times sparked debates online when an anonymous parent expressed disappointment on their child\u2019s school \u2013 not for starting early \u2013 but for ending early.\n\nIn a note that was posted on Facebook\u2019s All Singapore Stuff page, the parent expressed concerns at how ending classes 10 to 15 minutes everyday before the stipulated time meant a losing \u201cone day of his lessons\u201d in one month.\n\nSource: All Singapore Stuff/Facebook\n\nAccording to the parent, using the Diibear app which tracks check-in and check-out time, the child\u2019s check out time is often at 2.30 pm, which meant that the child was released 1o to 15 minutes earlier than that. The parent also wrote a detailed calculation of how long it takes \u201cchildren to pack bags, queue up, walk down the stairs, and maybe go toilet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI pay for school fees for school hours from 1130 to 1430. So technically speaking, the earlist [sic.] they start packing up should be 1425 then by the time they walk down and I fetch my child, should be 1435 to 1440, right?\u201d the post continued.\n\nThe note is then summed up with the parent asking if anybody else notices what time their child ends school and pointing out that parents would be questioning the school hours if it was for primary and secondary schools and tuition centres instead. \u201cu [sic] would not see that your child is released earlier than the stipulated time, right?\u201d\n\nThe post has has since gained a lot of attention and some hilarious comments from fellow Singaporeans, parents and even educators.\n\nHere are some of their comments:\n\nSo what do you think parents, do you ever notice your child\u2019s school hours?
