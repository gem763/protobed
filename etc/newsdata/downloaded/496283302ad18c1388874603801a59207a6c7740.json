He said:\n\nThe impulsive action of President Erdogan to invade northern Syria has put the United States in a tough situation, given our relationship with our NATO ally Turkey, who has fought alongside the United States in the past, and the Syrian Democratic Forces who helped us destroy the physical caliphate of ISIS, and the safety of U.S. military personnel.\n\nHe said, \u201cRather than get pulled into this conflict, we put the safety of our soldiers first, while urging Turkey to forego its operations and working hard with us to address their concerns through the development of a security zone along the border.\u201d\n\nDespite the administration\u2019s decision to take U.S. troops out of a pending military clash, critics have attacked the administration for \u201cabandoning\u201d the Syrian Kurds, who the U.S. armed to defeat the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria.\n\nCritics have accused the Trump administration of \u201cgreen-lighting\u201d a Turkish incursion into northern Syria, where the Kurds had staked out a semi-autonomous region during the Syrian civil war.\n\nThe Turks, who consider the Syrian Kurds to be terrorists and an existential threat, have long wanted to move against them in Syria. Esper said the U.S. had tried to prevent any pending attack, but that ultimately Turkey decided to make a move.\n\nHe and other senior national security officials have adamantly denied that the administration gave Turkey the green light.\n\n\u201cWe oppose and are greatly disappointed by Turkey\u2019s decision to launch a unilateral, military incursion into northern Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cThis operation puts our SDF partners in harm\u2019s way, it risks the security of ISIS prison camps, and will further destabilize the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the president on down, we have communicated with the Turks on this issue,\u201d he said. \u201cI spoke with Turkish Defense Minister Akar yesterday to express our strong opposition to Turkey\u2019s actions, and reiterated the damage this is doing to our bilateral relationship.\u201d\n\nHe also said the U.S. was not abandoning the Syrian Kurds. \u201cTo be clear, we are not abandoning our Kurdish partner forces and U.S. troops remain with them in other parts of Syria,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe remain in close coordination with the Syrian Democratic Forces who helped us destroy the physical caliphate of ISIS, but I will not place American service members in the middle of a longstanding conflict between the Turks and the Kurds. This is not why we are in Syria,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with members of the defeat ISIS coalition and the Syrian Democratic Forces to ensure the defeat of ISIS,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, he said the Syrian Defense Forces have transferred two ISIS terrorists to U.S. custody who were involved in the kidnapping and murder of U.S. and U.K. citizens in Syria. He said they were being held in a safe and secure location in the U.S., but outside of Syria.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019s @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Esper said the administration pulled back troops from northern Syria to make sure they were not in a fight between Turkey and Kurdish forces.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Mark-Esper-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
