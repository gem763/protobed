Only eight coffins were present \u2014 mourners said the five other families refused to participate because they were so angry their sons and brothers had been sent on the mission that was attacked.\n\nSome shouted at Gov. Silvano Aureoles: \"Like sheep to the slaughter!\"\n\nMore than 30 suspected cartel gunmen waylaid the police officers in the town of El Aguaje on Monday as they were traveling in a convoy to serve a warrant. Nine officers were also wounded in the worst attack on Mexican law enforcement in years.\n\nPresident Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador called the attack \"regrettable,\" but said he remains committed to his security approach emphasizing tackling underlying social problems even though national homicide figures have been setting all-time highs.\n\n\"We are going to continue with our strategy,\" L\u00f3pez Obrador said Tuesday. \"For us it is very important for there to be well-being, that peace with justice can be achieved ... and also avoiding that authorities mix with crime.\"\n\nMeanwhile, authorities in neighboring Guerrero state said late Tuesday that armed men confronted soldiers investigating an anonymous tip that gunmen were in Tepochica municipality. The ensuing gunbattle killed one soldier and 14 civilians, state security spokesman Roberto Alvarez said.\n\nThe incident happened the same day as the ambush in Michoacan, and Guerrero officials said they were still investigating to determine who was behind the attack. Guerrero is known for violence linked to organized crime and the army has been targeted on other occasions.\n\nIn Michoacan, signs left at the scene of the attack in the town of El Aguaje in Aguililla municipality were apparently signed by the Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful gangs.\n\nThe governor made solemn vows to assure families the killers would be brought to justice, but after years of bloodshed in Michoacan, he was met by shouts of \"Killer!\" and \"Justice!\"\n\nAureoles called for the army to send more soldiers to Michoacan and included a veiled criticism of L\u00f3pez Obrador.\n\n\"The criminals do not understand \u2014 response and action from Mexican government is needed,\" he said.\n\nWhile L\u00f3pez Obrador vowed to continue his strategy of avoiding violence, many doubt it will work.\n\nRaymundo Zavala, an office worker and resident of the Michoacan state capital of Morelia, longs for the days of Felipe Calder\u00f3n, who waged an all-out offensive against drug cartels during his 2006-2012 presidency.\n\n\"There has to be a strategy like Calder\u00f3n's in his time,\" Zavala said. \"Although things were more armored, it was safer. ... There was more order.\"\n\nAt the funeral home in Morelia, relatives of the dead described a situation in which relatively young, new, lightly armed police were sent in to confront hardened foes with heavier armament, without any support.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez graduated from the police academy just nine months earlier. He left behind a 1-year-old son and a wife who is five months pregnant.\n\n\"They asked for help, reinforcements, and it never arrived,\" his brother said, alluding to recordings of desperate radio calls sent out as the convoy came under intense fire.\n\nThe attackers let loose with .50 caliber sniper rifles and AR-15 and AK-47 assault rifles, and at least some were in armored vehicles, state prosecutors said. Some of the officers' bodies were still inside patrol trucks when they were set on fire.\n\nGonzalez's brother suggested there must have been an informant and the officers were set up.\n\n\"They say this is not going to go unpunished, when we know that in this state everything goes unpunished,\" the officer's uncle said.", "description": "Grieving relatives of 13 police officers killed in an apparent cartel ambush gathered outside a funeral home Tuesday, many of them angry at the government and police commanders they believe sent their loved ones to a certain death.  \"The good ones are here,\" said the brother of slain officer", "authors": ["Mark Stevenson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KGgBnqbxhrbl3ddEcBqo0A--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/c4b77a05b6a9530d9ee20d4eef175967", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
