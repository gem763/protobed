But the Constitution is clear about what is an impeachable offense, and there is serious doubt that the conduct of Trump is consistent with what the framers had in mind.\n\nProfessor Alan Dershowitz Alan Morton DershowitzSunday shows - Guns dominate after Democratic debate Dershowitz: 'Too many politicians are being subject to criminal prosecution' Epstein lawyer Dershowitz defends plea agreement MORE, who has made a study of impeachment, has argued persuasively that the framers, in using the term \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d as the key standard for impeachment, meant that an impeachable offense must at least be a crime, not just any crime, but a \u201chigh crime\u201d equivalent in gravity to an act of treason or bribery.\n\nIs what Trump did a crime? Although the Democrats and the media have routinely called his effort to \u201cdirty up\u201d Biden a crime, that is not at all clear. The foundation for the charge is campaign finance law, which makes it a crime to solicit or accept \u201canything of value\u201d from a foreign source. What was the \u201cthing of value\u201d that Trump solicited? According to his accusers in Congress, it was the agreement by Ukraine to investigate the potential connection of Biden to his son receiving lucrative business benefits.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne of the problems with this idea is that presidents always attempt to acquire things of value exactly like this, without ever triggering a claim of criminal behavior. Think of the speech that candidate Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaTrump's former ISIS envoy slams Syria decision: 'Donald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief' Where are questions of economic and political inequality in the Democratic debates? Rep. Joe Kennedy has history on his side in Senate bid MORE delivered in Berlin before he won the 2008 election. It involved much solicitation of and expenditure by the German government and was certainly of value to the Obama campaign. Was it then a crime?\n\nOr consider the many times in past campaigns that the prime minister of Israel has come to the White House and praised the incumbent president as a true friend of Israel. Does anyone imagine that this was a voluntary act or that the president did nothing to produce this endorsement at the time and place it occurred? Is there any doubt that this was a thing of value to the incumbent president who solicited it? Was it then a crime under campaign finance law? If it was, all past presidents who have benefited from this foreign support should have been impeached.\n\nEven if asking for an investigation of Biden were a thing of value under campaign finance law, is it something for which Trump is the sole beneficiary? There is certainly an argument that driving Biden from the race would benefit Trump next year, but if Biden had actually engaged in wrongdoing, then his exposure would prevent similar wrongdoing in the future and therefore benefit the American people as well as Trump.\n\nThe one time where a past campaign unambiguously solicited and paid for a thing of value from a foreign source was the $10 million payment by the Clinton campaign for the Christopher Steele dossier, made through an American law firm cutout to an American research firm. If Congress is going to impeach Trump for the crime of soliciting a thing of value from Ukraine, what basis would there be to deny that Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonPoll: Trump gains among independents against Biden, Warren Hillary Clinton calls Trump's Syria pullout a 'sickening betrayal' of allies Where are questions of economic and political inequality in the Democratic debates? MORE and her campaign should not be charged with a crime for this payment?\n\nIf lawmakers cannot distinguish the request that Trump made to Ukraine from these examples of ordinary campaign activity, the current rush toward impeachment by Congress and the media is either doomed to failure or a path to conviction for the 2016 Democratic candidate.\n\nPeter Wallison is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
