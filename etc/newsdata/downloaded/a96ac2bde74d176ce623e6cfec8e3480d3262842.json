Once there, select View installed updates on the left-hand panel, look for the KB4517389 update, right click and select Uninstall.\n\nAs always, it's best to back up your PC before each install and uninstall just in case there are further bugs causing havoc.\n\nDownload These Windows 10 Updates To 'Un-Break' Your PC Microsoft is having a field day with Windows 10 and by field day, I mean a catastrophe.
