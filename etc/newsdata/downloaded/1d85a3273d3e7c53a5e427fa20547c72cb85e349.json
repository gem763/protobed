Ng said the university had met some of the arrested students and would provide them with the \u201cnecessary legal assistance\u201d.\n\nDuring the 3\u00bd-hour session, Tuan was repeatedly questioned about the support the university provided the students. His replies were often interrupted by angry students who chanted slogans, pointed laser beams, shouted profanities and sang protest songs.\n\nDozens of students surrounded Tuan for more than 30 minutes after the meeting ended at 9pm. The students demanded that Tuan issue a statement condemning police brutality. Some students became emotional and burst into tears as they accused Tuan of continuously dodging questions.\n\n\u201cWhy is it so hard [for Tuan] to condemn police brutality?,\u201d a student said, weeping.\n\nPeople with masks join the meeting between Vice-Chancellor / President of Chinese University Professor Rocky Tuan Sung-chi.

Cheng\n\nTuan replied that he would issue a statement in a week and would condemn what he called the police\u2019s sexual violence, referring to an alleged sexual assault on some arrested protesters.\n\nAmong the students who spoke during the dialogue was Sonia Ng, who said she was arrested at Prince Edward MTR station on August 31 and later detained in San Uk Ling detention centre near the mainland border.\n\n\u201cDo you know the body search room in San Uk Ling is all dark? Do you know I am not the only one who was subjected to sexual violence?\u201d she said.\n\nShe also challenged Tuan to issue a statement to condemn alleged sexual violence by police, saying she would remove her mask if he did.\n\n\u201cI am willing to be courageous and take off my mask, would you also be brave and support us, and condemn police violence towards all the people arrested, including Chinese University students?\u201d she said.\n\nIn his opening speech, Tuan said the government should \u201cdo more work\u201d to resolve the divided society\u2019s many deep-rooted problems.\n\nVice-Chancellor/President of Chinese University of Hong Kong, Professor Rocky Tuan Sung-chi meets students and alumni for a discussion.

He also said he hoped members of the university would unite and \u201csail through these difficult times\u201d.\n\nTuan was then repeatedly grilled over whether he would condemn \u201cpolice brutality\u201d. He was also questioned about his stance on the controversial anti-mask law that came into effect last Saturday.\n\nThe law was not applicable on university campuses, he said, without elaborating. He also reiterated his stance of \u201ccondemning all kinds of violence\u201d, including police violence.\n\nOther students spoke out against the incident on Sunday when riot police officers entered the university and searched five students who were putting up promotional material. No arrest was made.\n\nIn response, Tuan said the MTR Corporation had called for the police because there were \u201cacts of vandalism\u201d at the station near the school.\n\nHe admitted that officers had entered the university, but said the school\u2019s security officers oversaw the situation. He said he hoped similar events \u201cwould not happen again\u201d.\n\nA 21-year-old student surnamed Tsang said he felt \u201cfrustrated\u201d by Tuan\u2019s comments, accusing the school official of evading many of the students\u2019 questions. Tsang said Tuan \u201cdid not offer anything new\u201d during the session, adding that he had hoped Tuan would promise more concrete actions for the arrested students.\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement released on Thursday night, police said they were aware of a female student claiming she was sexually assaulted by officers when she was detained at San Uk Ling Holding Centre.\n\n\u201cPolice accord high priority to such a serious allegation,\u201d the force stated, adding that its Complaints Against Police Office has not received any case of sexual assault related to the facility.\n\n\u201cWe will proactively contact the [woman] and appeal to her to provide concrete evidence so that we can launch a fair fact-finding investigation as soon as possible,\u201d the statement added.", "description": "Many were visibly upset after he refused to condemn police brutality in an open dialogue on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/1b38821e-eb58-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4imagehires083848.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
