Finland\u2019s neighbour, Denmark, also defines rape as involving force or a threat of violence, rather than looking at whether or not there was consent.\n\nAnna Blus, Amnesty International\u2019s women\u2019s rights researcher in Europe, said: \u201cIn many ways, Finland is a model country for gender equality, but its antiquated rape laws are badly failing women. The definition of rape in Finnish law, which is based on physical violence and incapacity, is outdated and discourages survivors from coming forward.\u201d", "description": "Council of Europe says law should criminalise lack of consent not just use of violence", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Rachel Kelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef27a3f615705cec120d9cf19152893adbd6f8a9/675_296_2142_1285/master/2142.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=404de34057f967dd3c3dc26120711cfd"}
