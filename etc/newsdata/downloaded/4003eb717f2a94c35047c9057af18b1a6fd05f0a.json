The hijackers demanded the release of Shi'ite Muslim prisoners from Israeli custody.\n\nThe passengers and crew endured a three-day intercontinental ordeal. Some passengers were beaten and a U.S. Navy diver who was on board the aircraft was beaten and murdered. Dozens of passengers were held hostage over the following two weeks.
