One of our best values here in America is free speech. We\u2019re allowed to say what we want to say and we are allowed to speak up about injustices and that\u2019s just how it goes. And if people don\u2019t understand that, that\u2019s something they have to deal with.\n\n\u201cIt was unfortunate for both parties and you\u2019ve got people speaking when they don\u2019t what they\u2019re talking about. Daryl Morey was right. Whenever you see something wrong going on anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say, \u2018That\u2019s not right.\u2019 That\u2019s what he did. When it comes to business, sometimes you have to tiptoe around things, but again, they understand our values. \u2026 We have the right to speak, especially with social media. We\u2019re going to say whatever we want to say, when we want to say it.\u201d\n\nthe best clip to start the NBA season is this kid baiting the broadcast into flashing a \"Fight for freedom stand with Hong Kong\" sign on TV and then the cameraman pans away pic.twitter.com/B30ubY63CX \u2014 Rod Breslau (@Slasher) October 23, 2019\n\nAdded Smith: \u201cIf we don\u2019t allow Darryl Morey \u2014 even if you believe him or not \u2014 to speak, it would be like telling LeBron [James] to shut up and dribble. \u2026 [for those who disagree], you have the opportunity to combat it with valid information and valid points. \u2026 The same way [as] when LeBron was speaking about social justice. And Chris Paul. And Carmelo Anthony. \u2026 The same as when the kneeling [during the national anthem] was going on in football. You have the right to speak about it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBarkley pointed out that Morey\u2019s tweet was especially sensitive because the Rockets were the NBA home of Yao Ming, who is now deeply involved in trying to expand the game in China.\n\n\u201cIf anybody else had sent a tweet, it would have raised some eyebrows, but because it was the Houston Rockets and their affiliation with Yao Ming \u2014 they\u2019re the most popular team in China,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cThat was the first thing he should have thought about. \u2018I\u2019m not just speaking for myself, I\u2019m speaking for the entire Rockets organization.' Because of Yao Ming, the Rockets are by far and away the most popular team in China. You can\u2019t come to my country and make money and insult me. We don\u2019t get to impress our values on other countries.\u201d\n\nJohnson recalled that the same sort of issue came up in 1991 when he traveled to Cuba to broadcast the Pan American Games for ABC and required restraint. \u201cThe last thing I was going to do when I got there was say, \u2018Man, this Fidel Castro has got to go,\u2019 \u201c he said \u201c \u2026 I think there\u2019s a responsibility when you\u2019re in your country to say, \u2018That\u2019s an injustice. I\u2019m calling you out on that.\u2019 But I think there has to be some restraint when you go overseas. You\u2019re not there to change the political system.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe same thing happens often during international competitions such as the Olympics and World Cup, when politics briefly are set aside, whether for the benefit of sportsmanship, good manners, capitalism or some combination of all three. O\u2019Neal agreed that visitors, even those with a financial stake, aren\u2019t there to change the world.\n\n\u201cHowever, China can\u2019t tell us what to do and we can\u2019t tell them what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the bottom line. We can send tweets, we\u2019ve got free speech, we can say what we want to say when we want to say it.\u201d\n\nBarkley jumped in to add, \u201cBut we all have a responsibility to our employer, too, whether you want to call it selling out or whatever. I can\u2019t come on TV and say anything I want to politically.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCountered Shaq, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve been doing it.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Barkley has been one of the more outspoken political and social commentators in sports. Johnson pointed out that Morey could have added nuance by writing an opinion piece rather than publishing a tweet that landed while NBA players were in China, One of those players was James, who questioned the timing of the tweet.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe did it from the confines of his little friendly home while the NBA players were over there. That\u2019s what LeBron said,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cHe tweeted and then we had to go over there.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, NBA officials, coaches and players have been happy to start the regular season, hoping it overtakes the China controversy. Many were reluctant, at least initially, to talk about the issue that engulfed the NBA\u2019s preseason games in China. Golden State\u2019s Steph Curry and Steve Kerr at first claimed that they didn\u2019t know enough to talk about the geopolitical issues involved and San Antonio\u2019s Gregg Popovich brought up President Trump as he defended Commissioner Adam Silver, who tried to balance the NBA\u2019s economic interests in China with the country\u2019s repressive regime.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday, authorities in Hong Kong\u2019s semiautonomous legislature withdrew the unpopular extradition bill that has sparked five months of violence and protests, but there was no indication that the protests would end, with pro-democracy protests flaring again this week with growing calls for universal suffrage and an investigation into allegations of police abuses.\n\nAD\n\nRead more NBA coverage from The Post:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "Chinese TV showed no games as the regular season began.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/amgBqUI2nn1k4bAhVMLYeLydax4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EZYDCQHVEYI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
