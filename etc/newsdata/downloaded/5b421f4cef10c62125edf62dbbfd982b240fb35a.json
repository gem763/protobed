Best Buy\u2019s new CEO Corie Barry told analysts on an August 29 earnings call that leasing is already having a \u201cpositive\u201d impact on same store sales.\n\n\u201cThroughout the second quarter, we continued to see customers use lease-to-own to acquire products across a wide variety of categories, with the largest being computing. We also continued to see a significant number of customers take advantage of the 90-day purchase option, which consists of an additional payment plus the retail price,\u201d Barry said.\n\nBest Buy tested its lease-to-own option in a few Texas stores for close to two years. It intends to complete a 45 state rollout by the end of the third quarter. An online leasing option isn\u2019t too far behind.\n\nThe lease length for products is often capped at 12 months. There is a 90-day payment plan and early buyout option.\n\nGiven the program is in its infancy, Best Buy didn\u2019t reveal the precise sales lift in the second quarter. Best Buy\u2019s domestic same-store sales rose 1.9% in the second quarter, which was generally viewed as a disappointment on Wall Street.\n\nBut for Best Buy, the early takeaway from lease-to-own is a win win. Not only is the company moving inventory at a quicker pace than otherwise normal, but it\u2019s pushing new customers into stores that have been significantly upgraded with new fitness, smart home and computing sections (among others).\n\nThat engagement is likely to get people thinking about what other tech gadget they may need or want.\n\nEngaging new customers\n\nEmployees assist a customer with a computer at Best Buy in Cary, N.C. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome) More\n\n\u201cWe definitely are seeing some level of new customer. I mean, between the new customers that we\u2019re seeing and what I call re-engaged or people we haven\u2019t seen very frequently, that\u2019s actually the majority of who we\u2019re seeing use the program. So, we like the fact that it\u2019s engaging for us a very different customer, maybe one that\u2019s been less frequent with us,\u201d explained Barry.\n\nBarry has said in the recent past the delinquency rate is low, too, around 1%. So it doesn\u2019t appear Best Buy is anywhere near headed down the same road as Countrywide \u2014 doling out bad loans to drive sales and profits.\n\nWall Street is on board with Best Buy\u2019s leasing foray as well.\n\n\u201cWe're encouraged to hear the initiative is yielding a comp lift and customers are utilizing lease-to-own for a wide variety of categories,\u201d Jefferies retail analyst Jonathan Matuszewski wrote in a note to clients.\n\nOppenheimer retail analyst Brian Nagel said the lease-to-own market in the U.S. \u2014 led mostly by Conn\u2019s and Aaron\u2019s \u2014 is worth around $25 billion to $35 billion. Nagel believes lease-to-own could add \u201cmodestly\u201d to Best Buy\u2019s same-store sales in coming quarters\n\nThat\u2019s provided there is no recession, which judging by the response to leasing electronics at Best Buy, isn\u2019t hiding around the bend right now.\n\nYahoo Finance All Markets Summit More\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
