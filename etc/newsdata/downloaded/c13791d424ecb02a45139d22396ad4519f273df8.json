In the past, couples wanting to stay in a hotel had to prove they were married.\n\n\u201cThis is no longer required for tourists,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSaudi Arabia announced on 27 September it was opening its doors to holidaymakers with the goal of diversifying its oil-dependent economy.\n\nThe kingdom had previously only issued visas to Muslim pilgrims, foreign workers and recently to spectators at sporting or cultural events.\n\nKickstarting tourism is one of the centrepieces of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s Vision 2030 programme to prepare the biggest Arab economy for a post-oil era.\n\nCitizens from 49 countries are now eligible for online e-visas or visas on arrival, including the US, Australia, UK and several other European nations.\n\nThe move to relax tourism rules comes as the country has been on a diplomatic offensive to counter criticism of its human rights record. The kingdom has imprisoned and tortured women\u2019s rights activists, carries out regular public executions, and was responsible for the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Kashoggi.", "description": "Kingdom relaxes rules as it turns to tourism to bolster economy for post-oil era", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse In Riyadh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a54d1de62b9e61ec16247af2d9bcffb421d4e3a/0_212_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f2ef999af288de6d096e681dac5b482a", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
