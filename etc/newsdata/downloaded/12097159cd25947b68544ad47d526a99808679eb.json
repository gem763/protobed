Josephine S., 19, (right) was found guilty of agreeing to be an accomplice and was released on an 18-month suspended sentence\n\nLehmann had met Michelle F. via Facebook and they had reportedly engaged in occasional casual sex. Her friend Henriette (pictured) was then invited for a threesome, but Michelle allegedly demanded \u20ac800 (\u00a3712) from Lehmann\n\nA third woman, Josephine S., 19, was found guilty of agreeing to be an accomplice and was released on an 18-month suspended sentence.\n\nThe court found that the motive for the attempted murders was apparently revenge on Lehmann after he refused to make good on a 800-EUR (712-GBP) payment to Michelle after she took part in a threesome with him and Henrietta.\n\nHowever, court spokesman Schueler-Dahlke said: 'The motive for the attack could not be established 100 percent by the court.'\n\nLehmann told the court: 'They tried to kill me. I managed to get away. They followed me trying a few more times, but I managed to limp away with the help of a stick.\n\nHenriette and Michelle first tried to kill Lehmann, 36, in November 2018 by giving him an overdose of psychotropic drugs in his drink.\n\nThe court heard they then drove him to woodlands near the Polish border where they gave him a further cocktail of drugs hoping to make him unconscious so they could kill him. But this did not work.\n\nRalph Lehmann (pictured) survived the attempts to take his life. He told the court: 'They tried to kill me. I managed to get away. They followed me trying a few more times, but I managed to limp away with the help of a stick'\n\nThe court heard how he was hit then on the head with a car jack and then they got a beer bottle out of the car and tried to hit him with that.\n\nAfter three blows to the head one of the women said: 'He is still moving, we need to change that.'\n\nThey then tried to run Lehmann over, causing injuries to his hip and stomach.\n\nLehmann was able to escape the attempts and flee despite his injuries.\n\nAfter the incident, the two women returned to the scene, but this time, the 19-year-old accomplice, Josephine, was also there to help her friends.\n\nShe allegedly said: 'If we find him, I will cut off his penis and cut out his heart.'\n\nThe court heard she googled the location of human organs on the body on her way to the forest.\n\nLehmann had met Michelle F. via Facebook and they had reportedly engaged in occasional casual sex. Her friend Henriette was then invited for a threesome, but Michelle allegedly demanded \u20ac800 (\u00a3712) from Lehmann.\n\nLehmann said: 'She said she wanted to buy something for 800 EUR. I didn't take it that seriously. The sex with Michelle was always consensual. The next morning, we all had breakfast together.\n\n'I told her I did not have \u20ac800 to give her, but we could pay it off monthly,'\n\nThe court believes the failure to give the woman the \u20ac800 could have led to the murder attempts.\n\nAccording to the court Michelle and Henrietta were so angry they made a pact to kill their lover. Their friend Josephine was then supposed to help them.", "description": "Two women from Frankfurt an der Oder, a town in Germany, were found guilty of trying to murder their male lover 5 times, including by drug overdose and running him over.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/15/19208386-0-image-a-6_1570026445480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
