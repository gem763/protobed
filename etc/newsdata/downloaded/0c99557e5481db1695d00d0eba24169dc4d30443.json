He said as he tried to reach the ball over the goal line on a sneak play, there was a Penn State defender in his face.\n\nBLIND FORMER COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYER MAKES JOKE AFTER LANE KIFFIN'S REFEREE TWEET\n\n\u201cYeah, a little bit,\u201d Patterson said when asked about whether there was eye-gouging, according to the Detroit Free Press. \u201dThat was not fun at all. They had me for a good 10 seconds in there.\u201d\n\nPatterson added: \u201cI was trying to reach the ball across the plane. I know for a good while I was screaming for my life.

But he kept fighting for us and I appreciate it. He\u2019s an awesome leader.\u201d\n\nPatterson confirmed Runyan\u2019s account of what happened and said it was the most violence pile he\u2019s ever been in.\n\n\u201cYeah, dude had his index finger in my eye, my whole \u2014 in my eye socket, for about, like I said, 10 seconds,\u201d he said.\n\nNeither player mentioned any Penn State player specifically in the alleged eye-gouging incident.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nMichigan lost the game 28-21.", "description": "Michigan quarterback Shea Patterson said Tuesday he had his eye gouged on a crucial touchdown during the Wolverines loss to Penn State over the weekend.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
