Probably one of the best is flying into Popham,\" he said, referring to the airport at which his journey began and ended.\n\n\"It's an incredible feeling and I just hope that I manage to achieve my challenge and inspire as many people as I can,\" he added.\n\nRelated content French man arrives in Caribbean after crossing Atlantic in giant barrel\n\nThe journey is far from Ketchell's only feat. He has already rowed across the Atlantic Ocean, climbed Mount Everest and cycled 18,000 miles around the world, according to a press release from his representatives.\n\nA gyrocopter, also known as a gyroplane or an autogyro, is a small helicopter-like aircraft powered by a propeller on its rear rather than blades on its top.\n\nKetchell's journey allowed him remarkable bird's eye views of sites across the globe. He shared some of the most remarkable fly-bys on his social media profiles -- including an image of him floating over the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.\n\nBut the journey also featured a handful of hairy moments.\n\n\"I was almost struck by lightning and had to attempt an emergency landing on the road,\" he told PA of an incident in Canada.\n\nThe explorer added that he was pleased it was raining when he landed for the final time. \"It shows people that it's not that simple, flying around the world,\" he explained.", "description": "A British adventurer has become the first person to circumnavigate the globe on a gyrocopter, completing a six-month journey that saw him narrowly escape a lightning strike on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190923110902-gryocopter-globe-crossing-super-tease.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
