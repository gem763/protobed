The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, struggled to gain traction and was down in recent trading after industrial conglomerate 3M cut its earnings outlook. The blue-chip index slumped 57 points, or 0.2%, to 26774.\n\nMicrosoft, PayPal Holdings and others reported solid profits, sending shares of those companies higher. The gains come as companies throughout the S&P 500 have mostly reported earnings ahead of Wall Street's forecasts, giving the broad index some support during what has been an otherwise listless month of trading.\n\nAbout a third of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported earnings so far, and 81% of those reports have topped expectations, according to FactSet. Investors have responded favorably, sending shares of most of those companies higher in the subsequent trading session.\n\nStill, the U.S. economy is showing clear signs of weakening, with some companies proving to be more susceptible to a range of factors that have been weighing on business activity, including ongoing trade tensions and waning growth overseas.\n\nShares of 3M fell 4.3%, dragging the Dow industrials firmly lower in early-morning trading. The industrial conglomerate posted lower quarterly sales in some of its core divisions and cut its earnings forecast for the rest of the year.\n\nTwitter dropped fell 18% after the social-media company's third-quarter earnings fell short of expectations. Its fourth-quarter revenue forecast also disappointed the market.\n\nEBay also fell, shedding 6.7%, after the online marketplace forecast its first quarterly revenue decline in four years. Ford shares dropped 4.7% after the car maker lowered its full-year profit target, sparking worries that a broad restructuring at the company isn't succeeding in driving earnings growth.\n\nAnd Baxter International declined 11% after the health-products company said it may need to restate results for at least five years.\n\nBut more upbeat earnings helped the market overcome those declines in early trading.\n\nMicrosoft reported late Wednesday better-than-expected earnings and revenue, in part due to the company's bet on cloud computing. Shares jumped 1.7%\n\nPayPal, meanwhile, said results for its latest quarter topped expectations, sending shares up 9.5%, putting it among the S&P 500's strongest performers.\n\nShares of Tesla, which isn't in the S&P 500, also saw a big gain after the electric-car maker surprised investors by reporting a profit for the third quarter, allaying fears that it was prioritizing growth and production over profit. Shares climbed 18%.\n\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.6%, even as Finland's Nokia dropped 20% after disappointing investors by slashing its full-year forecast. The world's second-biggest telecom-equipment maker was the worst performer in Europe as the growing costs of rolling out gear for 5G mobile networks also forced it to halt its dividend.\n\nThat followed a decision by the European Central Bank to leave interest rates unchanged and stuck with a plan to start buying bonds next month. The yield on German 10-year bonds were up to minus 0.387% from minus 0.391% on Wednesday. The euro was broadly flat on the dollar.\n\nOther central banks also took action Thursday. Bank Indonesia cut interest rates by a further 25 basis points, sending the rupiah down 0.5% on the dollar. Meanwhile, Turkey's central bank surprised markets with a bigger-than-expected cut to its key repo rate, sending the lira down 0.4%. The Norwegian and Swedish central banks held their benchmark rates unchanged.\n\nWrite to Avantika Chilkoti at Avantika.Chilkoti@wsj.com and Michael Wursthorn at Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 10:20 ET (14:20 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
