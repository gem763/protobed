The tax disclosure law has been on the books since 1924, and Democrats have contended in their court filings that the IRS has never before refused to hand over a tax return requested by a congressional tax committee. The IRS didn\u2019t hesitate to hand over tax material on President Richard Nixon, for instance, when lawmakers asked for it in the 1970s.\n\nTrump is the first president since Nixon to keep his taxes a secret.\n\nAn internal IRS memo that surfaced earlier this year said the law gives the bureau no wiggle room to refuse requests.\n\n\u201cI think the IG will focus on process,\u201d said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. \u201cI think the IRS refusal was unprecedented and illegal and I think it didn\u2019t follow the ordinary course of any other request.\u201d\n\nAnother line of investigation could focus on Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u2019s decision to intervene in the tax return request, which is typically handled by the IRS without the Treasury secretary butting in.\n\nBut if the IG finds that the Treasury Department failed to follow the law or its own procedures, the finding would likely have little practical effect, as the agency could simply ignore it. And the inspector would likely reach his conclusion after a long time, meaning not this year and possibly not next year, either.\n\n\u201cIt will come much too late,\u201d Rosenthal said.", "description": "The inquiry could eventually reveal if the administration failed to follow regular procedures after Congress requested the president's tax records.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d97a9a12100005000a95f4e.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
