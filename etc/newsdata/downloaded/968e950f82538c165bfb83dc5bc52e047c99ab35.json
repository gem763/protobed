Their answers will be published anonymously in Young Post. Then readers vote for their FAVOURITE answer. We will eliminate the contestant with the LEAST votes every week until we have a winner. The ultimate Brain Game winner will win a Mobile Pixel Duex duo monitor, which has been sponsored by searchingc.com, one of Asia\u2019s leading online shopping platforms.\n\nVotes close at midnight on Sunday.\n\nThe contestants\n\nContestant 1\n\nI would stay in a room for a while, then go back to the time that I had just entered the room. That way, I would be in the same place as my past self, and I could have a conversation with myself! That would be cool, but we might just end up saying the same things at the same time since we share the same mind. Or I might get to learn more about myself from myself.\n\nAfter we finished our chat, we could both go to school, but walk around different places and greet everyone we see. My friends and teachers would be very confused as they would keep seeing me everywhere they turned. My past self and I would have to make sure we didn\u2019t bump into each other, though, or else we\u2019d be caught.\n\nContestant 2\n\nTypical Time-Turners can only allow you to travel back a maximum of five hours. Many would try to use the device to right a wrong or talk to their past selves, but I would simply use the Time-Turner to get some extra sleep.\n\nBeing a secondary school student in Hong Kong is difficult and stressful. With exams and assignments to worry about, it becomes more and more difficult to sleep at night. What if I haven\u2019t studied enough for my exams? What if my group mates are angry at me for not doing enough work?\n\nThe Time-Turner would allow me to buy some time to have a good night\u2019s sleep without pressure, without responsibility, and without stress.\n\nContestant 3\n\nIf I had the Time-Turner for a day, I would probably go back in time to early March this year, if possible. I would go back to that time to stop the government from proposing the extradition bill law and warn them of what will happen if they don\u2019t listen to me.\n\nThe protests are getting more and more serious, and has greatly affected Hong Kong\u2019s business tourism, and daily transport. If I were able to stop the proposal of the bill, there would be no extradition bill protests, and Hong Kong would remain peaceful.\n\nI really hope Hong Kong can return to the way it was soon, otherwise it might never be the same.\n\nContestant 4\n\nThere\u2019s always the risk of running into yourself if you go back to a time in your lifetime. That is why I would choose a point in time before I was born. I would like to use the Time-Turner to spend a day with my grandfather, who passed away when I was quite young. I only have memories of him when he was sick, and I would like to see him as a strong, healthy man.\n\nAfter he died, everyone told me how much we wouldn\u2019t got along. I know they said this to make me feel good, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel a little regretful that I wasn\u2019t able to spend much time with him. I want to meet my grandfather on a cruise ship\n\n(a pastime of his, I was told) and hopefully start a conversation with him. He would not know we were related, but I\u2019m sure we could become good friends, even if we only had one day together.\n\nContestant 5\n\nI would go back to 2014, around the end of the Umbrella Revolution. At that time, protesters would have started to lose motivation to continue protesting after the police used 87 rounds of tear gas on them. Compared to the current protests, the government would\u2019ve been more open to listening to the Hong Kong people. If I could tell the 2014 protesters about what the government is doing now, I think they would work harder to make the government listen to them, and may even prevent the government from proposing the extradition bill in the future.\n\nI would probably abuse the Time-Turner several times more by going back to when I first received the necklace. That way, I could use the Time-Turner as much as I please.\n\n*In case of disputes, Young Post reserves the right to make a final decision on the winner.", "description": "The ultimate Brain Game winner will win a Mobile Pixels Duex duo monitor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/cbe253e8-efc1-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires110611.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
