Moreover, he hopes the new law proves to be the NCAA\u2019s undoing.\n\n\u201cI hope it destroys the NCAA, in general, because I think it\u2019s corrupt, and I think it\u2019s a bunch of people taking advantage of kids and doing it under a mask of fair play,\u201d 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman told NBC Sports Bay Area on Monday.\n\nThe new California law, the Fair Pay to Play Act, does not require athletes to be paid a salary. Instead, athletes are to be compensated for use of their image or likeness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either going to cripple the NCAA in a way that they start to bend and make it more fair and more of a symbiotic relationship between players and the NCAA, or it\u2019s going to destroy them and will start a whole new way of college athletics in general,\u201d Sherman explained. \u201cI can respect that, too.\u201d\n\nSherman is more than likely correct, the NCAA will either alter or be abolished by laws like the one recently passed in California.Especially, once other states begin following suit and either adopting similar, or even more far-reaching policies. One thing that\u2019s for sure, is that the NCAA can never be the same again. Given the proven and strong instinct for survival among executives with multi-million dollar contracts, it\u2019s more likely the NCAA will alter to fit the changing times, as opposed to dying on the hill of college amateurism.\n\nFor those arguing that free tuition is just compensation for college athletes, Sherman finds that math fuzzy at best.\n\n\u201cIf you did a cost analysis of how much each student brings in compared to what they earn in scholarship, one number would be greater than the other,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cThe bowl executives get how much? How much does March Madness executives get? Who\u2019s getting all that money? That\u2019s the thing that\u2019s so messed up is most people in the civilized world who are paying attention couldn\u2019t tell you where the money is going.\u201d\n\nOne thing that\u2019s clear, in the State of California, at least some of that money will now go to the athletes.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "College athletes in the State of California will now be able to receive pay for usage of their image and likeness.", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images_Ezra-Shaw-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
