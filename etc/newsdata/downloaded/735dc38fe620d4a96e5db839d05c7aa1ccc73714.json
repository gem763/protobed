Raja Krishnamoorthi, who sits on the House Oversight and Intelligence committees.\n\n\"We don't know who he was working on behalf of at any given time \u2014 it's not just President Trump.\"\n\nGiuliani did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, some Trump officials say the only person who can rein in Giuliani is the president himself.\n\nTrump's former special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, told members of Congress earlier this month that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was helpless to stop Giuliani's involvement, according to sources with direct knowledge of his closed-door testimony.\n\n\"I'm sure [Pompeo] could have called Rudy Giuliani, but would Rudy Giuliani stop what he's doing because the secretary of state calls him? I'd be surprised,\" Volker said.\n\nThis morning on \"ABC This Week,\" George Stephanopoulos asked Pompeo whether he gave Giuliani his blessing to act on behalf of the State Department.\n\nPompeo said it's his policy not to discuss internal deliberations publicly, despite the fact that Giuliani does not work for the administration.\n\nPompeo also refused to answer whether Giuliani was reviewed for potential conflicts of interest, amid revelations that he had business interests in Ukraine at the same time he was pushing officials to open an investigation into Joe Biden, Axios' Zach Basu notes.\n\nTrump transition flagged Rudy concerns in 2016\n\nThese concerns with Giuliani aren't new:\n\nAs far back as November 2016, a source who worked on the Trump transition team told Jonathan Swan, a colleague \u201cwalked back into the war room after an hour on the phone with Giuliani. He had a few pieces of notebook paper covered front and back with notes on red flags, and he looked like he\u2019d just seen a ghost.\"\n\na source who worked on the Trump transition team told Jonathan Swan, a colleague \u201cwalked back into the war room after an hour on the phone with Giuliani.

A second source with direct knowledge confirmed the account.\n\nIn June, Axios broke a story about leaked vetting documents that the Trump transition team and the Republican National Committee compiled in the fall of 2016. While vetting Giuliani, they found so many red flags that he was ultimately prevented from serving at the State Department.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
