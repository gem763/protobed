Players, on the other hand, claim to have encountered a weird glitch that got them an easy Nitemare Royale. Alongside the event\u2019s release is a new set of challenges with their corresponding rewards which include the new umbrella.\n\nInstant wins and a new item\n\nReddit user u/HierisIngo\u2019s post over on the game\u2019s subreddit has been gaining some traction as of late as it may well seem that the OP has stumbled upon a new glitch. Per the post\u2019s title, the OP claims that he got his Nitemare Royale without even jumping off from the Battle Bus.\n\nAccording to the OP, he just hopped into his first match right before the \u201cmovement froze\u201d adding that every player was kicked out of the match.\n\nHe then queued into another game after that happened. What\u2019s weird about it is that he got the Nitemare Royale screen without even jumping off the bus, not to mention that he claims to also receive the event-themed umbrella.\n\nHierisIngo doesn\u2019t have the slightest idea as to what happened, though a player commented that the glitch might be the reason why the new Storm King Limited Time Mode was temporarily disabled by Epic.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

Fortnite Video Game\n\nOther members of the subreddit also stated that they too experienced the glitch and received the \u201cFortnitemares\u201d umbrella.\n\nWhile others were delighted to instantly get the new item, there are some who stated that they don\u2019t feel like they earned it. Even the OP stated getting the umbrella in that manner \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel satisfying at all.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there are others who pointed out how overpowered the Storm King is in the game. U/Mr_Incredible commented that the boss\u2019 laser is way too strong that in one shots players and claims that it cannot be dodged.\n\nThat said, defeating the Storm King in the new LTM is just one of the challenges in \u201cFortnitemares.\u201d Here\u2019s the complete roster of missions alongside its corresponding rewards:\n\nDestroy haunted household furniture (5)\n\nLeap from a Hideout while and opposing player is within 20 meters (1)\n\nSearch a chest within the haunted forest, a ghost town, and a spooky farm (1)\n\nDealing damage to Storm King\u2019s weak points (10,000)\n\nReviving teammates while battling against the Storm King (3)\n\n(3) Defeat the Storm King (1)\n\nCompleting all challenges will give players a \u201cFortnitemares\u201d loading screen.\n\nBoth Storm King spray and banner token will be rewarded to players if they\u2019ve completed challenges four and five respectively. Defeating the big boss will unlock the umbrella.\n\n\u201cFortnite\u2019s\u201d Halloween event will run from October 29 to November 4.
