Tragically, they were never allowed to become Australian citizens and join Harry and his brother Joseph in Sydney.\n\nHowever it's a fair assumption that the $13.54 billion fortune that places the indefatigable builder third on this year's Rich List \u2013 a fortune whose initial blocks of flats in Tempe and Gladesville were funded by ownership of taxi fleets and milk rounds \u2013 is of a different quantum that deserves recognition atop the list of the self-made.\n\nLikewise Mike Cannon-Brookes (the son of a successful investment banker), Andrew Forrest (the scion of a Western Australian farming and political dynasty) and John Gandel (whose parents owned two corsetry shops in Melbourne) all had beginnings of relative privilege.\n\nJohn Gandel, seen here upon donating $2 million to build a new children's space and literacy programs at the State Library of Victoria, was handed two corsetry shops with which to start his empire.\n\nHowever, all have created wealth and opportunity far beyond that of most of their peers. For instance, Mr Gandel and brother-in-law Marc Besen had turned those two Sussan stores into 220 by the time Mr Gandel sold out, after a quarter-century's toil, in 1985.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGina Rinehart, the iron ore magnate one place ahead of Mr Triguboff on the Rich List with a $13.81 billion fortune, has long made a similar argument for herself to be considered as self-made.\n\n\"When Lang Hancock passed away his estate was bankrupt, which is publicly available information,\" she told Nine of her father's inheritance to her in late 2018.\n\n\"In addition, Hancock Prospecting \u2013 which he'd largely sold out of \u2013 was in an extremely bad financial situation at time of his death in March 1992, with the few remaining assets under threat of litigation or heavily mortgaged.\"\n\nThere is an argument for iron ore magnate Gina Rinehart being considered self-made, but she does not fit the criteria for this list as her father was on previous Rich Lists.\n\nShe added that tenements to the Roy Hill iron ore mine were not in the company when her father was alive, but acquired after his death.\n\nThe $3.8 billion valuation of Hancock Prospecting's stake in Roy Hill is now the second-largest component of Ms Rinehart's fortune, eclipsed only by her stake in the Hope Downs mine ($4.7 billion) whose tenements were pegged by her father, but developed by Ms Rinehart with production commencing in 2007.\n\nHowever the fact remains Lang Hancock was on the Rich List every year from its inception until his death.\n\nThe Hamersley Iron royalty stream derived from Mr Hancock's initial discovery of iron ore in the Pilbara in the 1950s remains an important underpinning of his only daughter's valuation, its worth estimated at just over $3 billion by the Rich List researchers in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustralia's richest man, box-making billionaire Anthony Pratt, has never argued like Ms Rinehart for self-made status. However, it's fair to say he has also taken the business legacy left by his father, Richard Pratt, to a new level.\n\nThis is particularly so in the United States, where the younger Pratt was sent in 1991 to oversee the family's one clapped-out paper mill there.\n\nHe's since turned the US business, Pratt Industries, into a job-creating machine championed by President Donald Trump. It turns over almost as much as its Australian counterpart, Visy, has achieved after 70 years.\n\nThe self-made status of others near the top of the Rich List is far more clear-cut.\n\nThe nation's third-richest citizen, Hui Wing Mau, came of age during China's cultural revolution and was dispatched to the countryside to be a \"barefoot doctor\", a Mao Zedong initiative where peasants were given basic medical training and sent to work in rural villages.\n\nMeanwhile Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar is from a working-class family in western Sydney \u2013 he didn't get a decent computer until university \u2013 while the deprived upbringing of media mogul Kerry Stokes has been well-documented.\n\nFind out who Australia's richest people are in the Financial Review Rich List 2019, out now and at select newsagencies through June.", "description": "Three-quarters of the individuals and families on the Financial Review's 2019 wealth survey did not start with a significant inheritance.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1968%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3ed3c669f0c432bad22bc2cfc1c52f278b79cdb7", "published_at": "2019-06-01"}
