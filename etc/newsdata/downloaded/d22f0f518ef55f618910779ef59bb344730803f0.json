The outage he triggered has exposed a big new risk for companies using open source.\n\nCrist wrote that Chef plans to fulfill its obligations to ICE and CBP under its current contracts. But also, it will donate an amount equivalent to its 2019 revenues from those contracts to charities that help people impacted by the border agencies' family separation and detention policies.\n\nWithin the company, Chef plans to create a team to decide how these funds will be allocated, which will be charged with creating a more \"systematic approach\" and ethics policy to evaluate customer contracts that could potentially be problematic.\n\n\"Chef, as well as other companies, can take stronger positions against these policies that violate basic human rights,\" Crist wrote. \"Over the past year, many of our employees have constructively advocated for a change in our position, and I want to thank them.\"\n\nLast week, in the immediate wake of Vargo's actions, Crist had said that Chef preferred to keep personal politics out of its business decisions, and that it would not decline to work with any legitimate authority.\n\nHowever, in Monday's blog post, Crist apologized for not initially taking a position on Chef's work with ICE, despite being privately opposed to ICE's policies and despite employees' recommendations.\n\n\"I apologize for this,\" Crist wrote. \"I had hoped that traditional political checks and balances would provide remedy and that our relationship with our various government customers could avoid getting intermingled with these policies. However, it is clear that checks and balances have not provided relief to the fundamental issues of the policies in question.\"\n\nChef first started working with the U.S. government in 2014.\n\n\"The overarching goal was to help them modernize their computing infrastructure and create a cooperative community of IT professionals inside the government that could share practices and approaches in a similar way to many open source communities,\" Crist wrote.", "description": "Chef faced outages last week after a former employee yanked his code from Chef, in protest the company's contract with ICE.", "authors": ["Rosalie Chan"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5ca50b1577584e4c71160f78-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
