They will appear on September 23 in front of a judge for a preliminary hearing.\n\nCourt administrators have apologized to the Dallas County Board of Supervisors and police.\n\nIn an updated statement, posted September 13, SCA said the group has been made aware of a \"similar\" break-in at the Polk County Historic Courthouse, but \"has no other information to share at this time.\"\n\n\"State court administration does not condone forcible entry into any building as a part of cyber-security or any other type of testing,\" SCA added.\n\nTechRepublic: Cybercriminals set sights on bot attacks and mobile apps\n\nCoalfire has not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication. The company told SC Magazine that over 10,000 security assessments have been conducted since 2001, and \"employees work diligently to ensure our engagements are conducted with utmost integrity and in alignment with the objectives of our client.\" However, Coalfire said it cannot comment further on the situation as an active legal matter.\n\nIn related news, another cybersecurity firm has become embroiled with law enforcement after Israeli police raided the offices of Ability Computer & Software and Ability Security Systems.\n\nSee also: Israeli police arrest execs from vendor of mobile surveillance tech\n\nThe Ability Inc. subsidiaries were raided as part of an ongoing investigation into the firm's export practices; specifically, the sale of software outside Israel's borders may fall foul of the country's laws.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
