That could pay electoral dividends for Johnson, if he succeeds in his call for an election. The prime minister's attempt to gain parliamentary approval for an early election failed on Wednesday evening.\n\nBut with an imminent election seemingly still highly likely, the poll results will be seen as a positive signal in No. 10 Downing Street. They suggest that the strategy of taking a tough stance against Tory opponents and pursuing an election to bring about Brexit by October 31 has a chance of paying off.\n\nWhile 43 percent of respondents said Corbyn as prime minister would be the worst possible outcome, just 35 percent said a no-deal exit would be worse. About one quarter said they were both equally bad options.\n\nOnly 39 percent of voters are optimistic about the U.K. leaving the EU without a deal.\n\nOne in five potential Conservative voters said opposition to Corbyn was their primary motivating factor in the way they voted. Asked who would make the best prime minister, 40 percent of the 995 people polled by Hanbury opted for Johnson, with just 18 percent favoring the leader of the opposition.\n\nAlthough respondents backed an early election in October \u2014 with 46 percent in favor and 36 against \u2014 the poll suggests that going to the country would be a gamble for the prime minister. The Conservative Party's lead is only a slim 7 percentage points over Labour \u2014 a similar margin to the one former Tory leader David Cameron had in 2015 when he won a tiny majority. It puts the Tories on 33 percent, Labour 26 percent, the Liberal Democrats on 17 percent and the Brexit Party on 14 percent.\n\nOnly 39 percent of voters are optimistic about the U.K. leaving the EU without a deal, compared to 41 percent who are pessimistic.\n\nA Brexit election\n\nSomething in Johnson's favor though, the poll suggests, is that he is unlikely to face a repeat of the 2017 campaign which deprived Theresa May of her majority in the House of Commons. In that contest, Corbyn's Labour party successfully shifted the election narrative from Brexit to domestic issues like the NHS and school funding.\n\nWith Brexit now dominating the political agenda, it now looks unavoidable that an early election would be fought primarily on that ground. Only 8 percent of voters said their vote would be motivated by investment in public services. In contrast, 17 percent said their primary focus was delivering Brexit on October 31 and 11 percent on revoking Article 50 and remaining in the European Union.\n\nSecuring a second referendum on the U.K.'s membership of the European Union is lower on people's priority list (with 7 percent), suggesting more voters see a general election as the route out of the current impasse.\n\nHYPOTHETICAL SECOND BREXIT REFERENDUM POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nJohnson's decision to suspend parliament in the run-up to the October 31 Brexit deadline divides opinion among voters. When offered the opportunity to choose multiple options, almost half (42 percent) of respondents saw it as \"an attempt to stop parliament from blocking no deal.\" Forty percent saw it as an \"attempt to deliver Brexit.\" Thirty percent said it was an \"attempt to end the Brexit stalemate.\" Nineteen percent said it was a \"normal part of government.\" And 16 percent saw it as \"an illegal coup.\"\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
