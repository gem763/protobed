(AP) - Todd Gurley has missed practice with a bruised left thigh, and the Los Angeles Rams don\u2019t know whether their star running back will play against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday.\n\nCoach Sean McVay says Gurley\u2019s injury \u201ccaught us all off-guard.\u201d\n\nThe Rams (3-2) haven\u2019t played since last Thursday, when they lost 30-29 at Seattle. The team initially thought Gurley\u2019s thigh problem was typical postgame soreness, but the Rams held him out of practice Wednesday along with cornerback Aqib Talib, who has bruised ribs.\n\nMcVay wouldn\u2019t guess whether Gurley will play against the unbeaten 49ers in a key early season NFC West rivalry game.\n\nGurley is a quiet 18th in the NFL with 270 yards rushing. He also has 14 receptions.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Todd Gurley has missed practice with a bruised left thigh, and the Los Angeles Rams don't know whether their star running back will play against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/rams_seahawks_football_30563_c0-197-4702-2938_s1770x1032.jpg?a01202bae6d73de3fa4aa8f45adec50f61d6c078", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
