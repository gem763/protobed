As Twitter users continue to feud over whether punching a Nazi is acceptable offline behavior, Twitter itself stumbled into the debate this week.\n\nThe platform suspended an account on Tuesday for posting a cartoon of Captain America pummeling a Nazi villain, designating the comic \u201chateful imagery.\u201d\n\nThe image depicts Captain America attacking the Red Skull, one of his longtime foes and an avowed Nazi. The antagonist has a swastika emblazoned on his chest\u2014possibly what a Twitter image scanning algorithm flagged for removal. As he\u2019s flying through the air, the Red Skull bemoans, \u201cSo much for the tolerant left.\u201d\n\nAllen McIntire, a software developer in Asheboro, North Carolina, used the drawing as his header photo for his Twitter account @CodeReclaimers to poke fun at what he saw as a perpetually and overly aggrieved right-wing mentality. He described his Twitter persona to The Daily Beast as \u201cshouting into the void.\u201d\n\nMcIntire woke up Tuesday morning to discover Twitter had suspended his account, though he estimated he\u2019d been tweeting under the image for more than a year. The email he received said he needed to change his cover photo to regain access to his account, so he changed it to a mashup of the original comic and Twitter\u2019s suspension notification.\n\nHe tweeted his frustration at Twitter. In all, he estimated Twitter locked his account for a couple hours. He was surprised he had been reported since he never received any threats or even strong pushback in replies, he said.\n\n\u201cI figured even as hypersensitive as people can be, cartoon violence against Nazis would be safe,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t have a huge following, either. It\u2019s rare I get more than 10 likes or retweets. It\u2019s low volume. I\u2019m not the kind of person anyone will bother reporting, but who knows.\u201d\n\nTwitter spokeswoman Raki Wane said of the suspension, \u201cLooks like a mistake was made on our end and the account has now been reinstated.\u201d\n\nMcIntire suspected he was the victim of an automated scanning system that looks at the billions of tweets that appear every day.\n\n\u201cThat was why I reposted the image as my cover photo. Is there a person in that loop at Twitter, or was it some system that doesn\u2019t require any of Twitter\u2019s employees to do anything?\u201d\n\nHe was more amused than outraged at the suspension, though.\n\n\u201cI think Twitter is overwhelmed. I can appreciate it\u2019s a difficult problem, but they seem clumsy about how they handle it,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you get one tenth of one percent of cases wrong, people will be angry, but I just thought it was funny.\u201d\n\nTwitter has long struggled with content moderation and addressing harassment, sometimes hitting users harder than necessary and sometimes using too light a touch. For example, the company said a man who mailed pipe bombs to prominent Democrats did not violate his rules when he had tweeted threats at a journalist just two weeks prior. The company has suspended and reinstated professed white nationalists multiple times.\n\nTo test whether all images of Captain America punching Nazis will trigger Twitter\u2019s content moderation algorithms, this reporter reported Daily Beast editor-in-chief Noah Shachtman\u2019s pinned tweet , which depicts Captain America punching a Nazi soldier with a swastika armband, for sharing offensive content. The Beast will update this story if his account is suspended.", "description": "Twitter called the suspension a \u201cmistake.\u201d", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568212478/190910-Montgomery-twitter-tease_oxf5hi", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
