I just play to win,\u201d Koepka said at a press conference prior to the start of the Shriners Hospital for Children Open. \u201cWin trophies. Win tournaments. Simple as [that]. Yeah, it would have been great but I think everyone in this room knows \u2026 I mean, LeBron has only won four MVPs and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s been the best player for more than four years, so.\u201d\n\nMcIlroy was named the PGA Tour Player of the Year last month in a close vote over Koepka. It was the third time he has won and the first time he won without winning a major.\n\n\u201cBrooks had an incredible year \u2014 an incredible two, three years, whatever it is,\u201d McIlroy said at the time. \u201cHe's the No. 1 player in the world golf ranking. ... I think this speaks volumes of what PGA Tour players feel is important. I think players don't just feel that four weeks a year is important. It's more than that. We play a lot more. Why do we play 25 times a year if only four weeks are important?\"\n\nKOREAN TOUR STAR RECEIVES 3-YEAR BAN AFTER OBSCENE GESTURE TOWARD FAN DURING TOURNAMENT\n\nHe added: \u201cI think that's a huge vote of confidence from the players that we play for more than maybe what the narrative suggests.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Koepka revealed he underwent stem-cell treatment to repair a partially torn patella tendon in his left knee. He said the operation took place the Monday after the Tour Championship.\n\nKoepka, who\u2019s made it known that he doesn\u2019t practice, said he couldn\u2019t practice because he actually couldn\u2019t practice, according to Golf Channel.\n\n\u201cI can finally practice again, which is nice, without pain,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year, I didn't practice at all. I mean, I vocalized that, said I hadn't practiced. \u2026 I finally feel good enough where I can actually practice and feel prepared coming into golf tournaments \u2013 not trying to find it on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cI'll be practicing this year.\u201d", "description": "Brooks Koepka on Wednesday shrugged off questions about Rory McIlroy winning the PGA Tour Player of the Year award despite winning the PGA Championship during the 2019 season.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
