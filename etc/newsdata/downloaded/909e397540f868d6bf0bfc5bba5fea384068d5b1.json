We have learnt with shock and outrage that four children were murdered by a person who is supposed to protect them,\" she said on Wednesday.\n\nIt is alleged that the father dropped his three children and stepdaughter at their home after fetching them from school.\n\nThe bodies of the three children, aged four, six and 10, were later foundhanging in their home while the body of the 16-year-old stepdaughter was discovered hanging from a tree.\n\nShe said the man had to separate the 16-year-old from her siblings \"to ensure that she did not rescue them\" and added that \"she was killed alone in the bush\".\n\n\"We want to see this man behind bars to pay for his sin. Police must work day and night to track him down so he can face the full might of the law. It's clear that this murder of these innocent children was premeditated because he abducted them from school. There is no justification, whatsoever, for the murder of children in such a brutal manner regardless of whatever differences may have existed between their parents.\"", "description": "The man suspected of hanging his three young children and teen stepdaughter in Durban has been arrested.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9042/fbf8d982d6da4c0daf0010c96a86acd3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
