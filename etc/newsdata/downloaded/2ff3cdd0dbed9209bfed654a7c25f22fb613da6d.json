Its developer, Aimmune Therapeutics Inc., proposes to market it under the brand Palforzia.\n\nThe FDA isn\u2019t bound to follow the advice of its advisory committees, but it usually does. The agency is expected to decide by late January on Aimmune\u2019s application to market the drug in the U.S.\n\nTrading in Aimmune shares was halted during regular hours on Friday because of the advisory committee\u2019s meeting. After hours, the stock gained 16% to $28.72. Before Friday, it had risen 3.1% this year.\n\nAimmune Chief Executive Jayson Dallas said allergy patients and their families are \u201canxiously waiting for an FDA-approved medicine that will provide them with an option beyond avoidance alone.\u201d\n\nPeanut allergies have emerged as a life-threatening peril for many parents, forcing them to pore over ingredients for any signs of peanuts and to equip their children\u2014and schools\u2014with devices to help with sudden and unexpected allergic reactions.\n\nThe incidence of peanut allergies in children has risen 21% in the U.S. since 2010, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Nearly 2.5% of children in the U.S. may have a peanut allergy.\n\nYet there isn\u2019t an approved medicine that can prevent allergy attacks. Instead, doctors have for years advised that children avoid peanuts altogether, not an easy task. And those with allergies carry epinephrine shots in case of accidental exposure.\n\nResearch in recent years has raised hopes for a preventive treatment. Studies have shown that gradually introducing small amounts of foods containing peanuts to children could prevent or limit the severity of allergic reactions. That approach is known as oral immunotherapy.\n\nThe drug developed by Aimmune, of Brisbane, Calif., builds on that concept. A study released last year found that the treatment helped reduce the incidence and severity of allergic reactions when children ingested a small amount of peanuts, compared with a placebo.\n\nThe drug didn\u2019t work for everyone and has some side effects, including allergic reactions to the drug itself. The FDA said it planned to include safeguards if it approves the drug, such as a requirement that patients have epinephrine to treat allergic reactions.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s advisory committee voted 7-2 that efficacy data supported use in children ages 4 to 17 years.\n\nSeveral parents and children with peanut allergies testified in favor of the drug at the advisory committee hearing in Silver Spring, Md., including some who said Aimmune paid for their travel.\n\nSome advisory committee members expressed concern about the allergic reactions to the drug, as well as a lack of racial diversity in the clinical study, most of whose participants were white.\n\nWrite to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com", "description": "A panel of outside advisers recommended that the FDA approve a proposed treatment for peanut allergies in children, a step that could clear the way for marketing the first approved treatment.", "authors": ["Peter Loftus", "Peter.Loftus Dowjones.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107225/social", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
