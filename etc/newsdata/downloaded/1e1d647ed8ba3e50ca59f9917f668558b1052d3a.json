Baidu is one of the world\u2019s leading artificial intelligence companies, and it is hoped this collaboration will act as a driver for effective advertising in the region.\n\nAlso announced at the September event were the new Effie Greater China council members, who attended a welcome ceremony and a council meeting held at the Baidu building. Gill Zhou was appointed chair of the council, and 13 other members were named; some from advertising agencies and educational institutions, others from leading companies.\n\nThe council works to promote the Effie award programs as gold standards in the marketing industry, and drives brand development in the region.\n\nIn 2019, Effie celebrates 50 years of encouraging excellence in advertising and marketing communication. Created by the New York American Marketing Association in 1968, it was founded to champion and reward effective campaigns across all forms of marketing, celebrating game-changing initiatives and strategies proven to meet and exceed their objectives.\n\nSince 2011, the \u2018Effie Index\u2019 has analysed the data from the campaigns of previous finalists in its awards programs to create a global ranking of marketing effectiveness, updated annually. Other resources include a \u2018case study database\u2019, featuring hundreds of effective marketing ideas from around the world.\n\nAs well as its awards programs, Effie functions as an educational resource for the industry, collaborating with research and media organisations and bringing its key findings on marketing potency and audience insight to a wider audience, along with learning tools for every stage of marketing.\n\nIt runs 52 global, national and regional programs across Europe, Latin America, the Middle East/North Africa, North America and the Asia Pacific region.
