This essentially means that it is an item that many buyers have purchased and were satisfied with, but it doesn't mean it has been heavily vetted by Amazon. The Amazon Choice label is important as these are the items that Amazon's search engine will deliver when you ask Alexa to search for you.\n\nWhich? says that the lack of vetting on these Amazon recommended products is extremely concerning.\n\n\"There appears to be little to no quality control with these sub-standard products, which risk people's security yet are being endorsed and sold on Amazon,\" Adam French, a consumer rights expert at Which? said in a statement to the press on Monday.\n\n\"Amazon and other online marketplaces must take these cameras off sale and improve the way they scrutinize these products,\" he continued. \"They certainly should not be endorsing products that put people's privacy at risk.\"\n\nCustomers raised safety concerns in some reviews online.\n\n\"Someone spied on us,\" said one customer who reviewed a $35.99 Victure security camera that carries the Amazon Choice badge. \"They talked through the camera and they turned the camera on at will. Extremely creepy. We told Amazon. Three of us experienced it, yet they're still selling them.\" Business Insider has reached out to Victure for comment.\n\nAnother customer wrote that he had \"chills down his spine\" after hearing a mysterious voice coming from a camera next to his child's crib after it was apparently hacked, Which? wrote in its press release.\n\nWhich? said it asked Amazon to remove these products and is urging the company to monitor customer feedback and investigate cases where consumers have identified issues with security. Amazon declined to comment on Which?'s findings, however. A spokesperson for the company did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.", "description": "Amazon is putting consumers at risk by listing and recommending cameras with security flaws, according to a report from UK consumer watchdog Which?.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9239b22e22af23d264d211?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
