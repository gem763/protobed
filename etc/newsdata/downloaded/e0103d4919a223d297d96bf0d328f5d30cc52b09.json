Prescription opioids are primarily used for pain relief but can be highly addictive.\n\nOn average, 130 Americans die from an opioid overdose every day, according to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which says more than 200,000 Americans have died from opioid-related overdoses in the last two decades.\n\nFirms including Purdue are accused of using deceptive practices to sell opioids including downplaying their addictive quality.\n\nPurdue argued the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, had approved labels for OxyContin that had warnings about the risks.", "description": "The drug maker, accused of fuelling the opioid crisis, files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17DE8/production/_106186779_oxycontin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
