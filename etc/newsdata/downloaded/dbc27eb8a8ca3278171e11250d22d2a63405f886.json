Flexibility. The other is tenacity. You stay persistent and never give up.\u201d\n\nYoshino, 71, works at the Asahi Kasei Corporation in Tokyo and is a professor at Meijo University in Nagoya, Japan, while Goodenough holds the Cockrell Chair in Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nWhittingham, 77, is a professor at the Binghamton University, State University of New York.\n\nThe trio will receive the prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist Alfred Nobel who created the prizes in his last will and testament.\n\nLast year, the honour went to US scientists Frances Arnold and George Smith and British researcher Gregory Winter for developing enzymes used for greener and safer chemistry and antibody drugs with fewer side effects.\n\nArnold was just the fifth woman to clinch chemistry\u2019s most prestigious honour since Marie Curie in 1911.\n\nThis year\u2019s Nobel season kicked off on Monday with the Medicine Prize awarded to Americans William Kaelin and Gregg Semenza, and Britain\u2019s Peter Ratcliffe.\n\n\u2013 Peace Prize on Friday \u2013\n\nThey were rewarded for research into how human cells sense and adapt to changing oxygen levels, opening up new strategies to fight such diseases as cancer and anaemia.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Physics Prize went to Canadian-American cosmologist James Peebles and Swiss astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz for research on how the Universe evolved after the Big Bang, and the first discovery of a planet outside our solar system, known as an exoplanet.\n\nThe Literature Prize will follow on Thursday, with two laureates to be crowned after a sexual harassment scandal forced the Swedish Academy to postpone the 2018 award, for the first time in 70 years.\n\nNames creating a buzz ahead of this year\u2019s literature prize include Canadian poet Anne Carson, Kenyan writer Ngugi Wa Thiong\u2019o, Romanian poet and novelist Mircea Cartarescu and Polish writer and activist Olga Tokarczuk.\n\nOn Friday the action moves to Norway where the Peace Prize is awarded, with bookies predicting a win for Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nThe Economics Prize will wrap up the Nobel prize season on Monday, October 14.\n\nburs-po/bp", "description": "Stockholm (AFP) \u2013 Three researchers won the Nobel Chemistry Prize on Wednesday for the development of lithium-ion batteries, paving the way for", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/727834_trio-share-million-swedish-kronor-914-000-or-833-000-euros-prize-equally-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
