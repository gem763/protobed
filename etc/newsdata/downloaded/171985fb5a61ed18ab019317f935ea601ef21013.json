He\u2019ll also assist in selecting wines for a special celebration or an important dinner, or even take a client on a trip to Burgundy to visit favorite producers.\n\nCurtis\u2019 clients range from relative novices like Weber to longtime collectors with extensive cellars who may need guidance securing a loan against their holdings, authenticating the quality of their wines, or selling them.\n\nNick Jackson of Vintage Variation, also one of about 382 Masters of Wine worldwide, finds no two collectors are alike and that even the most experienced can improve the quality of their holdings, both for drinking and investment.\n\nCollecting the \u2018Right Stuff\u2019 $40K High end of the annual fee Charles Curtis charges to advise collectors. 382 Number of Masters of Wine worldwide. $1,750 Amount Pete Weber paid for a case of Ch\u00e2teau Lynch-Bages 1986 at auction.\n\n$2,350 Amount Curtis estimates the same lot would sell for at retail.\n\nSeasoned collectors tend to make two mistakes: They are too conservative, buying the same wines over and over; or they are scattershot, purchasing bottles made by random producers from famous regions rather than focusing on the best producers, says Jackson, formerly the buyer for Sotheby\u2019s retail wine business.\n\nFine-wine collectors \u201cdon\u2019t need to have anything but the best,\u201d he says. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any fat on the bone. It should all be really, really good stuff.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a strategy that pays off in the long run. In the C\u00f4te de Nuits\u2014where the top wines in Burgundy are produced\u2014a collector would be better off buying a wine from an excellent producer for $140 a bottle than one from a so-so producer for $120, Jackson says. The bottle from a fine winemaker selling for $140 today will gain in value over time, while the bottle from the lesser one likely won\u2019t.\n\nJackson\u2019s fees vary depending on a client\u2019s needs. Typically, he charges a monthly retainer starting from about $600 for buying recommendations and perhaps placing a few bids at auction, to $3,000 a month to cover strategic planning across short-, medium-, and long-term purchases as well as for managing all the logistics of purchasing, including shipping and storage. \u201cEither way, I work proactively, always looking out for buying or selling opportunities for my clients based on their tastes,\u201d he says.\n\nBoth Jackson and Curtis were enmeshed in the auction world, where they gained valuable insider knowledge of how to strategize in a setting that can be intimidating to even the smartest of collectors. Jackson, for instance, advises submitting absentee bids as early as possible to gain priority.\n\nSabra Lewis\u2014a former Radio City Rockette who found her way to wine and a career as a sommelier and private wine consultant\u2014comes at wine collecting differently, believing the auction market limits collectors to a \u201ctiny, tiny fraction of the wine world\u201d focused only on top-tier, blue-chip producers.\n\n\u201cThere are so many other types of wine that will be valuable, that already are valuable,\u201d says Lewis, the former wine director at The Standard hotel at the High Line and former beverage director at L\u2019Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon. Instead, she seeks bottles from excellent, often small-production growers discovered on the so-called gray market by enterprising dealers.\n\nMost Champagne collectors, for instance, may not know Jacques Selosse\u2014a pricey, highly desired Champagne, but one that rarely sells at auction. Those in the know will go to Italy, where a good amount is sold, and round up bottles to bring back legally to the U.S., where distribution is scarce, Lewis says. Selosse and other excellent wines produced with limited availability \u201cwill go up in value no matter what, as more people realize how great these wines are,\u201d she says.\n\nWorking with Curtis, Weber has acquired collectible wines that he expects will appreciate. In early June, he bought about $50,000 worth from a Christie\u2019s auction in New York, including 12 bottles of Ch\u00e2teau Lynch-Bages 1986 in their original wooden case for $1,750. Curtis estimates that the average retail price for this lot would have been about $2,350, although \u201csourcing at retail for older wines is very time-consuming and difficult, as it is very rare to find a full dozen in wood.\u201d\n\nBefore working with Curtis, Weber learned from fine-wine retailers like Sherry-Lehmann, whom he still likes to buy from. But retailers are in the business of selling wine, he says, while Curtis, as a consultant, \u201chelps me find wines at the right price.\u201d", "description": "Fine-wine specialists guide collectors in building investment-worthy cellars that are a pleasure to drink, too", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-100331/social", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
