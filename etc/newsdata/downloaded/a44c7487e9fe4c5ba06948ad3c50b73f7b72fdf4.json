(Anna Fifield/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Chinese state has come down not once, but twice, on Mayila Yakufu.\n\nFirst, the 41-year-old insurance company worker was taken away for 10 months of \u201cvocational training\u201d in one of the internment camps China has set up in the mostly-Muslim Xinjiang region as part of an extensive campaign to strip the Uighur minority of its culture and language.\n\nShe was out for barely four months before the authorities picked her up again \u2014 this time for financing terrorism. Now, the single mother of three is in a prison for criminals, serving a sentence of unknown length.\n\n\u201cThey are targeting us like the Nazi government targeted the Jews,\u201d said Mayila\u2019s cousin, Nyrola Elima, who lives in Sweden. \u201cWe just want to be able to live a normal life.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese campaign to forcibly assimilate the mostly-Muslim Uighur minority, whose culture and language is Turkic, into the Han ethnic majority is showing signs of entering a new phase.\n\nUighurs living abroad have started to hear reports of family members being arrested and jailed on suspicion of financing terrorism after sending money to relatives abroad. Those relatives have also had their savings and assets confiscated by the state, they say.\n\nThis new and alarming effort appears aimed at keeping Uighurs in China from having any contact with their family members beyond the country\u2019s borders, analysts say.\n\n\u201cThis is the first I\u2019ve heard of this,\u201d said Rian Thum, who specializes in Uighur history at the University of Nottingham and has been monitoring the crackdown in Xinjiang. \u201cThis shows that there has not been any letup or any softening of the policy of pursuing Uighurs who have any connection with the outside world.\u201d\n\nChinese authorities declared in July that their effort to \u201cde-radicalize\u201d the population of Xinjiang had been a success and that 90 percent of the people put into camps had been released \u2014 a claim analysts and activists say is highly doubtful.\n\n\n\nMayila Yakufu spent 10 months in an internment camp operated by China. She was picked up again in four months after her release and charged with financing terrorism. (Family photo)\n\nFor the past three years, Chinese authorities have taken somewhere between 1 million and 3 million people, mostly Uighurs and ethnic Kazakhs, into what Beijing calls \u201cvocational training schools\u201d designed to root out extremism in the majority-Muslim area.\n\nWestern governments and human rights activists have condemned the camps and the broader operation to control Uighurs in Xinjiang, to no avail.\n\n[China celebrates \u2018very happy lives\u2019 in Xinjiang, after detaining 1 million Uighurs ]\n\nThe story of Mayila and her extended family in Yining \u2014 pieced together through interviews and documents \u2014 is just one of the many accounts of state-led pressures imposed on Xinjiang and is emblematic of new efforts targeting the Uighur minority.\n\nThe charges against Mayila appear to relate to money she sent to her parents, who had traveled to Australia in 2007 to see their son and his family in Adelaide, about 850 miles west of Sydney.\n\nThen tragedy struck. Their son drowned in the sea on New Year\u2019s Eve. Her parents decided to stay in Australia to support their widowed daughter-in-law and take care of their grandchildren.\n\nThey opened a Uighur restaurant selling shish kebabs and noodles, and they started saving. After six years, they were ready to buy a house.\n\nOn June 23, 2013, they signed a contract for a three-bedroom, one-bathroom house in an Adelaide suburb for 377,500 Australian dollars, or about $259,000 at the current exchange rate. The settlement date was July 9, 2013, according to a copy of the contract provided by Marhaba Yakub Salay, Mayila\u2019s sister, who also lives in Adelaide.\n\n\n\nMayila\u2019s parents signed a contract to buy a house in Adelaide, Australia, on June 23, 2013. The settlement date was July 9, 2013, according to the contract. (Family photos)\n\nBack in Xinjiang, Mayila got busy transferring the savings her parents had left behind \u2014 the proceeds of years of running trading businesses in Xinjiang and compensation for land sold to the Chinese government.\n\nBecause of Chinese banking regulations, Mayila split the transfer into three parts.\n\nThe first tranche arrived in Australia on July 2, 2013, with Mayila listed as the sender. The following day, two deposits were sent: One in an aunt\u2019s name and another in her uncle\u2019s name, according to bank statements. By July 9, the settlement date, Mayila\u2019s parents had enough to pay for the house in cash.\n\n\n\nMayila transferred her parents\u2019 savings in three installments. The first tranche arrived in Australia on July 2, 2013. (Family photo)\n\n\n\nThe second and third installment, sent by Mayila\u2019s aunt and uncle, respectively, arrived the following day. (Family photo)\n\nMayila stayed in touch with her parents and her sister in Australia and her cousin Nyrola in Sweden.\n\nMayila was busy at home in Yining, near the border with Kazakhstan. She would bike to the markets early to sell walnuts, before going to her day job at China Life Insurance Co. She was so good at her work that the company awarded her a certificate with a red star.\n\nAt night, Mayila, who studied in a Mandarin Chinese school and university, would teach Uighur children the majority language.\n\n[China wages crackdowns on its Muslims. But Saudi Arabia stays quiet as it bolsters ties with Beijing. ]\n\nTo relax, she enjoyed watching \u201cModern Family\u201d with her children. Among the characters on the sitcom is a gay couple, and Mayila liked the idea of supporting and accepting one another no matter what.\n\n\n\nBut in 2017, things began to change.\n\nChinese authorities started to sever links between Uighurs in Xinjiang and family members overseas. Officials began conducting spot checks of phones and then installing software so they could monitor electronic communications remotely.\n\n\u201cOne by one, my old friends said goodbye to me through WeChat and deleted me,\u201d Marhaba said, referring to the social media app that is the lifeblood of communication in China. \u201cI felt like my sister would delete me soon, too.\u201d\n\nSure enough, she did.\n\nChinese authorities have \u201ccreated an atmosphere where any contact with relatives overseas or even in a different city is viewed with suspicion,\u201d said James Leibold, an academic at La Trobe University in Australia who has written extensively about the repression in Xinjiang.\n\n\n\nThere is a police box on every corner in central Yining.

(Anna Fifield/The Washington Post)\n\nThe family later learned that Mayila had been taken to an internment camp.\n\nMayila\u2019s aunt and uncle \u2014 Nyrola\u2019s parents \u2014 took care of her children, a girl and two boys, and tried to keep them safe. Children of some interned Uighurs have been sent to orphanages.\n\nLike many Uighur families, they kept their heads down to try to avoid more attention from the state.\n\nIn December 2018, Marhaba suddenly received a call from her sister. \u201cWe\u2019re good, we\u2019re all good. The Communist Party of China is looking after us very well,\u201d she recalled Mayila saying.\n\n\u201cWe think she might have been in a police station and that someone had asked her to make the call,\u201d Marhaba said.\n\nIn April, four months after her release, Mayila went missing again. Marhaba contacted the Australian authorities, who made inquiries about the case.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade informed the family that Mayila had been arrested May 15 on suspicion of financing terrorist activities. This week, officials informed the family they had received an update from the Chinese embassy in Canberra.\n\nMayila \u201cwas prosecuted in July 2019 for allegedly financing terrorist activities and is currently in good health,\u201d an Australian official wrote in an email to Marhaba.\n\nSuch prosecutions in China almost always result in conviction, but the family has not been able to find out what sentence she received or to visit her. Officials in Yining and in Beijing did not respond to requests for comment or information.\n\n\n\nPeople\u2019s Square in Yining, once a public space for families in the area, is now closed. (Anna Fifield/The Washington Post)\n\nAnother Uighur living abroad, Halmurat Idriss, said his sister was also accused of financing terrorism. She wired $2,800 to his bank account in Turkey, where he moved in 2016 with his parents, his wife and their three children for the promise of work and a better life.\n\n\u201cThat money was my parents\u2019 pension funds, and we needed it to survive because I did not have a job at that time,\u201d he said. His sister was detained over the transfer, he said, and he has not heard from her in three years.\n\nThe charge of \u201cterrorism\u201d has become a byword for any activity deemed to undermine the ruling Communist Party.\n\n\u201cThe party-state uses the term \u2018terrorism\u2019 for anyone who opposed it, from the Hong Kong protesters to the Dalai Lama to Xinjiang,\u201d said Leibold. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can take the party-state at face value when they use that term.\u201d\n\nMayila\u2019s cousin and sister say she has been held in prison for the past six months, with no access to lawyers or family members.\n\nThe authorities also confiscated all of Mayila\u2019s savings \u2014 the equivalent of about $56,000, Nyrola said. It was money she had saved from working three jobs. \u201cThey are now targeting people with money so that they can take it,\u201d Nyrola said.\n\n[U.S. Senate revives bill that could sanction China over treatment of its Muslims ]\n\nMayila\u2019s aunt and uncle continue to look after Mayila\u2019s children.

Mayila\u2019s youngest, Zikirulla, was born two months premature and is, in the words of his aunt, \u201csmart but not strong.\u201d\n\nAll three of them go to Mandarin Chinese school in Yining, not schools taught in the Uighur language.\n\nMayila\u2019s aunt and uncle, 60-year-old Gulebaikeremi Maimutimin and 63-year-old Hasimu Tuoheti, live in constant fear that the children will be taken from them.\n\nLast month, they received notices from the Public Security Bureau that they were being investigated on suspicion of helping finance terrorist activities and illegally possessing articles of extremism.\n\nThey trace this action to the fact that their names are associated with the money sent to Australia in 2013 for Mayila\u2019s parents\u2019 house.\n\n\u201cWe can prove that this money didn\u2019t go to terrorist activities,\u201d Nyrola said, referring to the bank statements and the housing contract.\n\nHer mother has been busy teaching the children how to cook and shop and look after themselves in case she is jailed, Nyrola said. She has shown them where the winter clothes and bedding are stored and how to turn on the heating once the cold weather arrives.\n\nThey are waiting to see just how bad this winter will be.\n\n\n\nA riverfront amusement park frequented by tourists in Yining.
