Death isn\u2019t always sad, especially when the best of the best in our military takes out the trash. As Bronson wrote over the weekend, Al-Baghdadi was cornered in a raid in Syria\u2019s Idlib Province. He decided to kill himself by detonating a suicide vest. He killed his three children in the blast as well. The Washington Post decided to give this animal an obituary in which they labeled him an \u201caustere religious leader\u201d because Trump derangement syndrome has broken the minds of liberal America and their news outlets. Remember, \u2018orange man\u2026bad.\u2019 This administration cannot be afforded one single day of good news coverage. That\u2019s the Democratic Party in 2019. That\u2019s the progressive Left in 2019.\n\nAnd because of that\u2014these clowns will believe anything CNN, MSDNC, and whatever liberal rag will peddle that throws mud at this White House. It\u2019s why the liberal media has become a laughingstock. Most of their negative stories about Trump are either nothing burgers, have been totally debunked, irrelevant, or straight-up fake news.\n\nWith the raid that killed al-Baghdadi, Operation Kayla Mueller, Obama\u2019s White House photographer decided to put on his tinfoil hat and suggest that the Trump Situation Room photo was staged. It wasn\u2019t, as reported by T. Becket Adams over at The Washington Examiner:\n\nObama White House photographer Pete Souza created a fake news narrative all by his lonesome on Sunday following the announcement that U.S. forces had taken out Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. [\u2026] The raid, as reported, took place at 3:30PM Washington time. The photo, as shown in the camera IPTC data, was taken at \u201817:05:24,\u2019\u201d Souza tweeted in a note that has been shared by more than 20,000 people. [\u2026] Souza tweeted later in a follow-up note, \u201cJust to be clear, I didn't say it was staged. Trump himself said he didn't arrive to the Situation Room until \u2018around 5pm\u2019. So it's definitely possible the photo was taken during the raid.\u201d He added in yet another follow-up, \u201cThe latest reporting from the NYT: the helicopters left Iraq at 5PM (Washington time), and they reported it was about a 70-minute flight to Syria. So actual raid had to happen some time after 6:10PM.\u201d The honorable thing would be for Souza, who has yet to explain where he got his initial timeline of events, to just delete his initial, baseless tweet and get it over with. But he has not. That viral tweet is still live, racking up those sweet, sweet Resistance retweets.\n\n@DavidCayJ decided to share the fake news to his 150,000 followers. pic.twitter.com/t9lSEj2L2t \u2014 Brett MacDonald (@TweetBrettMac) October 27, 2019\n\n@PeteSouza now has 15k RTs and 40k likes on his fake news post.\n\n\n\nHe has not deleted it, he's instead reveling in the dopamine rush that each count gives him as it ticks upward incrementally. pic.twitter.com/HhNeIpLNZP \u2014 Brett MacDonald (@TweetBrettMac) October 27, 2019\n\nMSNBC spread this news to their millions (or dozens?) of dedicated weekend viewers.\n\n\n\nWill there be an on-air correction? An apology for the president? pic.twitter.com/7NT1T7GgPy \u2014 Brett MacDonald (@TweetBrettMac) October 27, 2019\n\nI can\u2019t remember anyone who isn\u2019t insane suggesting that the Obama Situation Room photo on the night we killed Osama bin Laden was staged. If that happened, it\u2019s still insane. At that moment, I couldn\u2019t care less about who occupied the Oval Office, we killed freakin\u2019 bin Laden. It was time to party. I\u2019m opposed to almost everything the Obama administration advocated and pushed on a policy level but killing bin Laden; I could for one night get behind that. Sadly, liberals aren\u2019t that patriotic or mature apparently. Also, we have yet another reason why people don\u2019t trust the media. The leader of ISIS is dead. His successor was also recently picked off by us. It\u2019s a good day.", "description": ".10/29/2019 19:58:18PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/302/fb7e35eb-d4bd-4c75-bf8c-8dfb0951ae9a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
