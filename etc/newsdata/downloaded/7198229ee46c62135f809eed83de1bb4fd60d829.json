No, not yet", "language": "en", "text": "Quid pro no.\n\nThe current impeachment debate is being framed in terms of whether or not there was a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d\u2014 as if that is the bar that will determine whether or not President Trump Donald John TrumpSchedule for additional depositions in impeachment inquiry revealed Sondland attorney disputes key portions of Taylor testimony: report Impeachment inquiry might be public by mid-November: report MORE did something egregious.\n\nThere are big flaws with this framing, as well as with the use of the term.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDiplomatic quid pro quo \u2014 requiring certain actions, behavior or \u201cconditions\u201d in return for U.S. aid \u2014 is common, according to current and former diplomats I spoke with, and foreign policy guidance. \u201cUnder the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the President may determine the terms and conditions under which most forms of assistance are provided.\u201d\n\nThe notion that there\u2019s something inherently wrong with this sort of foreign-aid diplomacy is raising concern among some career diplomats. A former Obama administration State Department official told me that, by controversializing this common practice, \u201cthe Democrats are basically hamstringing any future president.\u201d He adds: \u201cThat\u2019s why this is a constitutional moment.\u201d\n\nIt is true that few Americans would think it\u2019s appropriate for a U.S. president to use his foreign aid diplomacy to set conditions to receive \u201cdirt\u201d on a political opponent. But the available information is proving to be a far cry from the original \u201cwhistleblower\u201d allegations that Trump \u201csolicit[ed] interference from a foreign country\" in the 2020 presidential election, in quid pro quo fashion.\n\nForeign aid is widely considered a tool to allow the U.S. \u201caccess and influence in the domestic and foreign affairs of other states,\u201d particularly \u201cnational security policy.\u201d It also \u201chelps governments achieve mutual cooperation on a wide range of issues.\u201d\n\nAll of this appears to neatly fit the definition of the very things President Trump\u2019s critics allege he did: try to ensure Ukraine\u2019s cooperation in the U.S. investigation into the 2016 presidential campaign, and obtain a commitment from Ukraine to open an investigation into widespread corruption that could have U.S. ties \u2014 including a possible tie to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMost Americans may not know it, but Ukraine could be uniquely positioned to assist the U.S. in these matters. Multiple reports allege that Ukrainian officials, under a previous Ukrainian president, partnered with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 to \u201csabotage Trump.\u201d According to Politico, \u201cUkrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonOcasio-Cortez reelection campaign refunds ,000 in donations from pro-Trump former Facebook exec Hillary Clinton celebrates Central Park's first statues honoring women Booker: 'Democrats don't need more candidates to enter' MORE and undermine Trump.\u201d A paid consultant with the DNC, Alexandra Chalupa, met with Ukrainian officials in 2016 to \u201cexpose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortEx-Clinton lawyer predicts at least one count of obstruction of justice from Trump impeachment inquiry New York City lawmakers vote to close Rikers Island jail by 2026 Perry says Trump directed him to discuss Ukraine with Giuliani: report MORE and Russia,\u201d Politico reported, and \u201cthe Ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race, helping to force Manafort\u2019s resignation and advancing the narrative that Trump\u2019s campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine\u2019s foe to the east, Russia.\u201d\n\nIt could be argued that Trump\u2019s interest in digging into Ukraine\u2019s corruption and foreign interference in the 2016 campaign transcends political desires. It fits a mandate. Since he was elected, Trump and Congress have been pressed to get to the bottom of improper foreign influence in the 2016 election that happened under the watch of Obama intel officials such as then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper James Robert ClapperBrennan's CIA a subject of Barr's review of Russia investigation: report Federal prosecutors interviewed multiple FBI officials for Russia probe review: report Trump denies knowledge of Barr meeting in Italy, says it would be appropriate MORE, then-CIA Director John Brennan John Owen BrennanBrennan's CIA a subject of Barr's review of Russia investigation: report Federal prosecutors interviewed multiple FBI officials for Russia probe review: report Trump denies knowledge of Barr meeting in Italy, says it would be appropriate MORE and then-FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyCNN's Jeffrey Toobin says he regrets role in playing up Clinton email story Federal prosecutors interviewed multiple FBI officials for Russia probe review: report State cites 38 people for violations in Clinton email review MORE. And the Trump administration and Congress have pledged to do all they can to prevent a repeat in 2020.\n\nBack to the Democrats\u2019 notion that it\u2019s improper \u2014 or possibly even criminal \u2014 for President Trump to hold out U.S. aid in order to achieve cooperation from Ukraine\u2019s new president. On Tuesday, headlines were made from widely leaked closed-door testimony by William Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who assumed that position in July. Taylor reportedly testified he was \u201calarmed\u201d that the Trump administration supposedly was withholding military assistance unless Ukraine committed to investigating 2016 election corruption, including alleged wrongdoing by the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.\n\nYet Ambassador Taylor is very familiar with the process of \u201cconditioning\u201d U.S. foreign aid. He spoke of it extensively in November 2011 after he had just been handpicked by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for a new position as the State Department\u2019s Special Coordinator for Middle East Transitions, specifically Egypt, Tunisia and Libya.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll condition your aid based on the direction in which these countries are going?\u201d a reporter asked Taylor at a news conference.\n\n\u201cOur assistance is part of our foreign policy. This is clear,\u201d Taylor replied. He went on to give examples of how U.S. aid would be used as leverage. Quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cWe will say to the Egyptians, don\u2019t send us that check [you owe the U.S.] for a billion dollars, which is actually 300 million over three years, keep that there, but we will agree with you \u2014 we, the United States Government, will agree with you, the Egyptian Government, on how to spend that billion dollars in Egypt,\u201d Taylor told reporters.\n\nA more recent example is the admission by former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenImpeachment inquiry might be public by mid-November: report The Memo: GOP schisms deepen as Trump impeachment pressure rises Graham nixes plan to send Pelosi letter warning GOP won't convict Trump MORE that he was able to get Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor as a condition to receive U.S. foreign aid. Quid pro quo.\n\nEven if it were to be considered wrong for Ambassador Taylor, former Vice President Biden, President Trump or any U.S. president to engage in quids pro quo involving foreign aid, there\u2019s still an issue in the current impeachment debate. A quid pro quo has two essential parts. First, a deal must be understood between the parties. In this case, it would be President Trump delivering U.S. aid if, and only if, the president of Ukraine delivers dirt on Trump\u2019s \u201cpolitical rival\u201d and potential 2020 opponent \u2014 Joe Biden.\n\nSecond, the goods must actually be delivered. In this case, President Trump would have had to receive the requested packet of \u201cdirt\u201d on Biden, in order to trigger release the U.S. aid to Ukraine. So far, there is not an allegation that Part Two ever occurred. Without delivery of the dirt, there\u2019s no quid pro quo. Just a quid.\n\nThe most that can be reasonably alleged against President Trump at this stage is that he offered a quid pro quo \u2014 something both Trump and the other party, the president of Ukraine, deny \u2014 but that it was never consummated. New facts could emerge but, right now, there seems to be less than meets the eye.\n\nOne thing is clear. Some State Department diplomats, maybe lots of them, disagree with President Trump\u2019s ideas and strategies. Ambassador Taylor confirmed as much. The fact is, the authority on these matters comes from the top down. Diplomats are not freelancers who develop and implement their own policies and goals independent of the wishes of a president; they are tasked with implementing a president\u2019s foreign policy, whether they like him (and his policies) or not. Diplomats who disagree are generally not entitled to unilaterally defy, undermine and work against a president\u2019s wishes.\n\nAll things considered, it begins to look like the quid pro quo accusations are an extension of the strategy that sought to keep President Trump from providing typical direction to the Justice Department for the better part of two years \u2026 because his critics cried that it would be obstruction of justice or interfering with the Mueller probe. With that investigation closed, Trump\u2019s enemies appear to be trying to keep him from digging into dark, uncomfortable places about how it all came about and who was behind it, from Washington, D.C., to Kyiv, Ukraine.\n\nPlaces where many Democrats and Republicans would rather he did not dig.\n\nSharyl Attkisson (@SharylAttkisson) is an Emmy Award-winning investigative journalist, author of The New York Times best-sellers \u201cThe Smear\u201d and \u201cStonewalled,\u201d and host of Sinclair\u2019s Sunday TV program, \u201cFull Measure.\u201d", "description": "Diplomatic quid pro quo \u2014 requiring actions, behavior or conditions in return for US aid \u2014 is common, according to diplomats.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trump_oval_office_10062019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
