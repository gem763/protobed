Yes and no - Will it be removed? No chance", "language": "en", "text": "Blood letting: Will landlords have to give up valuable tax breaks?\n\nAfter shrinking in the financial crisis, the share of the housing market taken up by buy-to-let is again approaching a record level.\n\nBuy-to-let accounted for nearly 20 per cent of all UK mortgages by early 2008 before falling to less than 10 per cent by late 2009. The share was back to 12 per cent in the first part of last year but climbed to 18 per cent in March, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders.\n\nFor many people, this is a problem. Given our inability to build enough new homes they despair that an increasing share of the ones we have are being bought by landlords rather than young people.\n\nIt's led to calls for a perceived tax advantage held by buy-to-letters - their ability to write off their mortgage interest costs against the tax they pay on rental income - to be removed.\n\nI say 'perceived' because not everyone agrees there is an advantage. That's because, in another important way, landlords pay more than the rest of us.\n\nThey pay Capital Gains Tax, often 28 per cent, on the increase in the value of the properties they own. Owner-occupiers pay nothing.\n\nGiven that the majority of returns made by landlords come from growing house prices rather than rents, a higher rate of CGT certainly hurts them.\n\nAs Robert Joyce, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, explained: 'The tax system actually tends to favour owner-occupation over buy-to-let, for two big reasons:\n\n'a) There is no capital gains tax on primary residences, but buy-to-letters do pay capital gains tax.\n\n'b) Buy-to-letters pay tax on the rental income that they get from their tenants; owner-occupiers pay no tax on the effective rental income they get in light of the fact that they are their own landlord.'\n\nI suppose whether you agree with this depends on your point of view. Viewed from a high level and over a long period of time, as economists are fond of doing, the overall advantage may still lie with owner-occupiers.\n\nOthers, though, can see that this advantage isn't really worth anything if you can't buy a home in the first place to benefit from capital gains. Landlords' advantage on mortgage interest, albeit smaller overall, makes it harder for first-timers to get at their advantage on CGT further down the line.\n\nI've written before that what's needed is a consensus about what we want the housing market in the UK to do. Are we bothered about falling rates of home ownership, or not? Would our leaders prefer a house is owner-occupied rather than rented out, or are they agnostic?\n\nPoll Should buy-to-let landlords lose their mortgage interest tax relief? Yes No Should buy-to-let landlords lose their mortgage interest tax relief? Yes 1913 votes\n\nNo 2809 votes Now share your opinion\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly when it establishes proper answers to these questions can the Government ensure the system works to help get the outcome it wants.\n\nWhatever it were to decide, though, there will be no sudden removal of landlords' tax breaks.\n\nWhy? The answer is one of practicality rather than principle and revealed in a series of exchanges between Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne over the past year.\n\nA year ago the Chancellor asked the Financial Policy Committee, the Bank's body in charge of keeping an eye on big threats to the economy, to recommend ways to reduce the risk posed by the property market.\n\nIn his response, Mr Carney requested that the Bank be given powers to tell lenders to limit mortgages in some key respects.\n\nIt had already recommended that lenders grant no more than 15 per cent of their new mortgages to those borrowing more than 4.5 times their income. Now it wanted to formalise these powers for the future and, crucially, it wanted a similar power over buy-to-let lending.\n\nSpecifically, it wanted to be able to limit the Interest Coverage Ratio on buy-to-let loans. This is a percentage that shows the level of the rent versus the interest payments on the loan.\n\nFor example, some banks require a ratio of 125 per cent before they'll lend, so the rent must be at least 125 per cent of the interest repayments.\n\nWhile the Chancellor was happy to grant formal powers for owner-occupier loans, he was less convinced about the need to limit buy-to-let. Why the Treasury was happy to allow controls for owner-occupier loans but not buy-to-let is not clear.\n\nIt said it would do its own work to establish the need for controls, with work delayed until after the election.\n\nUnconvinced: The Bank requested formal powers to instruct Buy-to-let lenders, but George Osborne and the Treasury have resisted.\n\nIt's just possible to detect the Governor's disappointment, dare I say annoyance, at this in a letter to the Chancellor from March this year. You can read it here.\n\n'The Committee will continue to make evidence-based arguments for any future Recommendations to HM Treasury to grant it further powers of Direction', he wrote, 'as you note it did for the leverage ratio and housing market tools in 2014.'\n\nBUY-TO-LET MORTGAGE CALCULATOR Work out your monthly payments Mortgage amount: \u00a3 Interest rate: % Duration: years Mortgage type: Interest only Repayment ::: Calculate ::: Monthly payment:\n\nThe Bank is clearly convinced of the need for powers to curb buy-to-let lending (although this is not the same as saying it wants to use those powers now).\n\nIn making its case the Bank has explained that financial crises tend to be preceded and made worse by house price booms, and that buy-to-let 'amplifies' the effect.\n\n'Any increase in BTL lending in an upswing will add further pressure to house prices, which is likely to prompt owner-occupiers to take on even larger loans, thereby increasing overall risks to financial stability', it has said.\n\nTo back its claims, the Bank points to American studies that found those US states with a larger and increasing share of transactions by investors saw a bigger boom and bust in house prices.\n\nThe point of all this is that the Interest Coverage Ratio the Bank wants to be able to influence is directly affected by the tax relief a landlord gets.\n\nRemoving the tax relief on mortgage interest reduces the money they have to pay their lender and a landlord that just meets, say, a 125 per cent requirement with the help of tax relief will fail to meet it if the relief is removed. My colleague Simon Lambert has explained the effect of the change here.\n\nGiven the Bank of England has identified the potential need for a limit to ensure buy-to-let lending remains safe, it would be incredible if it then sanctioned a change that suddenly meant many landlords fell short of this level and had to sell up in large numbers. That's exactly the instability the Bank wants to avoid.\n\nThis is not to say the current position is satisfactory. It cannot be a good thing that changes that would potentially improve fairness in the system can't happen because the property market is effectively to big to fail.", "description": "Not everyone agrees there is a true advantage for landlords.
