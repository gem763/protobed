Others are minimizing their involvement in OpenLibra, which aims to become an alternative to Facebook's Libra.\n\nEthereum developer Lane Rettig excitedly took to Twitter on Oct. 8 to share Geiger's announcement of OpenLibra at the Ethereum developer conference Devcon 5, in Osaka, Japan, adding:\n\n\u201cSeeing #openlibra publicly announced for the first time is sending shivers down my spine. I am so excited about this initiative to \u2018lock the door open\u2019 for libra tech.\u201d\n\nDuring the launch, certain names were mistakenly associated with the project, while other names were used without proper permission. Some organizations were presented as members, when, in fact, they have nothing to do with OpenLibra. Geiger later apologized in a Telegram message to Chainlink CEO Sergey Nazorov and Coindesk, saying:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in a rush preparing materials, and my team took a list I had of partners and potential partners and put it on the site. It\u2019s removed now. Apologies for the trouble that [this has] caused. I should have reviewed more closely.\u201d\n\nLaunch of OpenLibra\n\nCointelegraph reported on Oct. 9 that OpenLibra\u2019s developers had released the first version of the proposed alternative to Facebook's Libra stablecoin.
