African swine fever is a highly contagious viral disease of domestic and wild pigs. The virus spreads by direct contact between pigs or indirectly by contaminated items such as feed, feed ingredients, equipment, vehicles, clothing and footwear. Symptoms of disease can include: elevated temperatures, weakness, reduced appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, skin lesions, nose and eye discharge, coughing or difficulty breathing, convulsions.

There is no antidote or vaccine for affected pigs and the only known way to prevent the disease from spreading is a mass cull of affected livestock\n\nMs McKenzie said increased border checks have led to 100 kilograms a week seized in illegal pork products.\n\nBetween November 5, 2018 and August 31, 2019 over 27 tonnes of pork were intercepted on air travellers entering Australia.\n\nLast month, South Korea reported its first cases of African swine fever, while China's swine herd is down by about 40 percent, and the shortage has pushed prices of the country's meat staple up by at least half.\n\nA Rabobank report warned China could lose 200 million pigs during the epidemic.\n\nEarlier this year, the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization said almost five million pigs in Asia had died or been culled because of the spread of the disease.", "description": "The deadly virus, which\u00a0causes haemorrhagic fever in pigs and is almost always fatal, was confirmed to have killed hundreds of hogs in East Timor last week.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/01/19348404-0-image-a-5_1570323465372.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
