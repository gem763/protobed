An Instagram account with stock images of Poland had 51 observers. And even some of those images were wrong. A picture of a sunset over the Polish capital turned out to be of Prague. A photo of ski jumping champion Kamil Stoch was of an acrobatic ski jumper \u2014 a completely different sport.\n\n\"Those social media accounts were put up because our support staff was enthusiastic and wanted to do something nice,\" said Judge. \"The fact is we didn't pay much attention to that.\"\n\nHe explained that about half of the foundation's money had been used to produce and place two 30-second television ads \u2014 one extolling Poland's religious tolerance, and another on its military. \"I think we had a fair amount of success.\"\n\nOnet also reported on Wednesday that a lot of the money flowing to the Washington PR firm went to a right-wing Polish-American scholar, Marek Chodakiewicz, and his family with close ties to the leadership of the Polish foundation.\n\nJudge said that the professor had been hired \"because he was an obvious and inexpensive way of filling a slot at a conference.\" His sister, Anna Wellisz, is an employee of the White House Writers Group, but Judge said her hiring was independent of Chodakiewicz.\n\nPoland's opposition parties attacked the foundation for misspending public funds.\n\nThe foundation \u201csquanders public money because the people managing it are amateurs. They are ideologues, emotionally committed to what they do, but lack organizational skills,\" said Marek Migalski, a former PiS MEP now standing as an opposition candidate in the ongoing senate race.\n\nHowever, the government is digging in.\n\nPiotr Gli\u0144ski, the deputy prime minister and culture minister, attacked Onet for reporting the news, alluding to its German ownership. \"If a medium which \u2014 and I won't talk about who is their owner \u2014 has an interest in undermining the sense of actions undertaken by the Polish state ... then it's difficult for me to comment.\" (Onet is owned by Germany's Axel Springer, which is also a co-owner of POLITICO Europe.)\n\nThe foundation took a similar line of defense. \"We regret the fact that the Onet Group selectively and subjectively decided to use the cooperation between the Polish National Foundation and the White House Writers Group to deprecate and discredit actions undertaken by the foundation.\"\n\nIt's not the first controversy to hit the foundation.\n\nIn 2017, it spent 8.5 million z\u0142oty on a billboard campaign in Poland to attack Polish judges \u2014 a way of supporting the government's controversial judicial reforms. A court later ruled that the campaign violated the permitted goals laid out in the foundation\u2019s charter.\n\nIt is sponsoring trips to Poland by well-known (and less well-known) people \u2014 ranging from Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak (the foundation wouldn't say how much it paid to get him to come to Warsaw) to U.S. television personality Rita Cosby.\n\nIt also spent \u20ac900,000 on a yacht called \"I love Poland\" that was supposed to take part in regattas around the world. It's sitting in a U.S. boatyard with a broken mast.\n\nThe foundation's problems are big news in Poland, but the PiS government has shrugged off a long series of scandals which haven't affected its leading position ahead of the October 13 election. An opinion poll out this week put PiS at 45.6 percent, with the leading opposition Civic Coalition at 31 percent.\n\nPOLAND NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "Warsaw\u2019s ruling party faces yet another scandal, but is still way ahead in opinion polls.", "authors": ["Maria Wilczek", "Jan Cienski", "Zosia Wanat"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h_55276037-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
