He had really bad COPD, which didn\u2019t help, and he had congestive heart failure and other health issues, but the power going off and him not being able to get to his oxygen is, I believe, is what did it.'\n\nMardis Sr.'s oxygen tank reportedly lost power during PG&E's power shutdown and he was unable to reach his battery-operated oxygen tank in time.\n\n'He\u2019ll never see my kids get married, he\u2019ll never see his grandchildren,' Aldea said.\n\n'How do you fix that?
