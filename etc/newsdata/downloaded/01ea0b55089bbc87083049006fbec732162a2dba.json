KCNA via REUTERS\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the testing of a super-large multiple rocket launcher on Tuesday, North Korean state media KCNA said on Wednesday.\n\nNorth Korea fired a new round of short-range projectiles on Tuesday, South Korean officials said, only hours after it signalled a new willingness to resume stalled denuclearisation talks with the United States in late September.\n\nKim, who had guided the testing of the same multiple rocket launcher before, said its capabilities have been \u201cfinally verified in terms of combat operation,\u201d and what remains to be done with the rocket launcher is a \u201crunning fire test,\u201d KCNA said, without elaborating on what the test would entail.\n\nKim ordered future tasks and ways to \u201csteadily\u201d attain cutting-edge national defence to officials that had joined him, including senior officials such as his sister Kim Yo Jong, KCNA said.\n\nWhile analysts said North Korea conducts weapons tests for a range of purposes, including technical development and reassurance for the defence establishment, Tuesday\u2019s launches appeared to have been timed to send a message to Washington, such as what may happen if the United States doesn\u2019t come to talks with North Korea with realistic proposals.\n\nAlthough U.S. President Donald Trump has played down previous tests this year, saying he did not believe short-range missiles violated any agreements, now-ousted national security adviser John Bolton had said even short-range launches by North Korea are banned under U.N. resolutions.", "description": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the testing of a super-large multiple rocket launcher on Tuesday, North Korean state media KCNA said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Joyce Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428467262&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF89267", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
