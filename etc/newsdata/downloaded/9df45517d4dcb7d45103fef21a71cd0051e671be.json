Yet the 29 year old says the performances come at a high price\n\nThere is nowhere to sit and talk in the Soho members\u2019 club, but just as we are heading elsewhere, Amrou Al-Kadhi peels away to greet a member of staff. From their warmth, they appear to know each other well. But when we step outside, Al-Kadhi beams and whispers: \u201cWe just swiped right on each other!\u201d\n\nAl-Kadhi \u2013 who is a screenwriter 60% of the time, a drag queen the rest and uses the pronoun \u201cthey\u201d \u2013 is very open. Their book Unicorn: The Memoir of a Muslim Drag Queen is published this month. It is full of intimate revelations, all of which echo with the painful \u201ccoded silences\u201d that dominated their youth.\n\nAl-Kadhi, 29, is British Iraqi, but grew up in Dubai, then Bahrain, before moving to London. They are gay, Muslim, Eton-educated, a twin, a writer, performer: it\u2019s a lot of life for a 29-year-old.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d they say. \u201cI often do feel quite a lot older.\u201d They sound tentatively pleased; I suspect because they are a high achiever, and, in a funny way, this puts them ahead. But then Al-Kadhi says sadly: \u201cI feel I never had a youth, to be honest.\u201d\n\nAl-Kadhi was 10 when they realised they were gay, having fantasised about the cartoon Robin Hood, and then Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone. But their parents couldn\u2019t accept the possibility that Al-Kadhi was anything but heterosexual. \u201cEven if you feel gay, just sleep with girls, and you will no longer be gay\u201d was their father\u2019s advice, backed up by anti-homosexual teaching at school that provoked terrifying nightmares. Al-Kadhi still often wakes to find the bedding on the far side of the room.\n\nTheir book details the various methods, some harrowing, they tried in order to gain short-term relief from the unbearable sense of a divided life: from acting to abusive relationships, chemsex parties, academic perfectionism and a passion for tropical aquariums. There\u2019s also a unicorn tattoo, on Al-Kadhi\u2019s chest, the rump of which they used to rub, for comfort and luck.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was drag. \u201cWhenever I\u2019ve had violence against me, or something really upsetting has happened, the first thing I think is: I need to be in drag, and on stage tonight,\u201d Al-Kadhi says.\n\nGetting ready is a kind of meditation. \u201cI\u2019m talking the meticulous drawing of the brow. Trying to get every line right. I love it. So peaceful.\u201d We have finally found somewhere to talk, settling with a coffee in a theatre cafe, and their fingers are tracing careful arches above each eye as they speak. \u201cGluing eyebrows, putting on foundation. It\u2019s the transportation. Very mindful.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018As soon as I stop working, I feel quite a lot of sorrow.\u2019 Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nIt was at Cambridge University that Al-Kadhi discovered drag, organising events and becoming a \u201cdrag mother\u201d to their fellow queens in the university\u2019s first professional drag band. \u201cWhen I started doing drag, it felt like the ultimate rejection of everything I was taught in the Middle East.\u201d But the variance between the joy of performance and the repercussions from disapproving family in Dubai only heightened the sense of being at odds with themselves.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t liberating? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t! I felt like I was lying. I was trying to live out things that I didn\u2019t actually believe about myself. Everyone was looking to me as this voice of liberation. And I just wasn\u2019t that ... Whenever the drag came off, I would have a nervous breakdown.\u201d\n\nAl-Kadhi, who performs as Glamrou, says they experienced their \u201cfirst set of breakdowns\u201d around this time. But they still scored the highest first in their year, so some portion of life must have remained intact; or, perhaps, the devastation was medicated with an obsession with work.\n\nEven now, Al-Kadhi works six days a week, 9am to 9pm. Unicorn was written in six weeks of solid 10-hour days. \u201cAs soon as I stop working, I feel quite a lot of sorrow,\u201d they say, toying nervously with the toggle of their hoodie. \u201cIf I take a day or two off, I can\u2019t stop crying. The amount of work it takes for a queer person to do well in life is exhausting!\u201d\n\nAs a young man, whenever Al-Kadhi was caught by their parents watching gay TV shows or films or referring to their homosexuality in texts to friends, their parents would confront them. \u201cMy dad actually said to me: \u2018You don\u2019t have to keep talking to us about this gay stuff. Talk to us about the weather if you have to. Just don\u2019t bring that up.\u2019\u201d\n\nYet despite this conflict, love runs through this book. Al-Kadhi\u2019s mother, they say, \u201csays I\u2019m the greatest love of her life\u201d. She says that still? Even while Al-Kadhi celebrates their queer identity in drag performances?\n\n\u201cShe does say that. But she always caveats it: \u2018You\u2019re the greatest love of my life \u2013 and the person who\u2019s ruined my life.\u2019\u201d\n\nWriting the book was partly an attempt to understand this relationship. \u201cA lot of women in the Middle East tend to be the voicepiece of the patriarchy because of the domestic role that they occupy,\u201d Al-Kadhi says.\n\nTheir mother is presented as someone who will go to any lengths for the right look. She once deployed the services of a welder to effect a last-minute repair to a dress. All this might make a person appear ridiculous. \u201cBut I got it \u2013 \u2019cos me too! Clothes mean a lot to me,\u201d Al-Kadhi says. The two recently bonded over their mother\u2019s quest for a tropical-themed hat. \u201cI\u2019m the daughter she never had.\u201d\n\nSo it is not surprising that, as Glamrou, their favourite outfits are \u201cthe ones that remind me of my mum \u2026 There\u2019s this emerald, snakeskin-type dress. Whenever I wear it, everyone says: \u2018You look like your mum!\u2019 I love wearing that. I also love wearing Islamic abayas.\u201d\n\nTheir early drag aped white stars such as Lady Gaga and Lana Del Rey, and in this sense clothing once caused a fissure not just between Al-Kadhi and their mother, but between Al-Kadhi and their cultural heritage and even race. Now, however, costume is helping them to narrow the gaps. \u201cI like that feeling of inserting myself in my heritage through being queer,\u201d they say.\n\nReligion too is no longer something to be feared. Al-Kadhi uses the pronoun \u201cthey\u201d for Allah. \u201cThe way that I conceptualise Allah is that they\u2019ve gone from being a source of self-punishment to being a source of self-love.\u201d\n\nAl-Kadhi has even left their old drag group, Denim, to pursue solo performance in a show called Glamrou: From Quran to Queen, because \u201call the other Denims are white \u2026 Whenever I tried to explore race within the show it would have to be quite a cursory five minutes.\u201d Striking out on their own has given Al-Kadhi a platform from which to address race \u2013 last week they praised Naga Munchetty live on the BBC for speaking out against racism.\n\nThe memoir acts as a sort of guidebook to this wholesale reassertion of a cohesive identity, culminating in the moment when Al-Kadhi explains that they regard their biological mother as a sort of long-lost drag mother. Have they ever told her this?\n\n\u201cYeah, I have actually said that once. And she just said: \u2018Why would you want to be a woman?\u2019 Oddly enough, her position as a woman and my position as a queer person in society brings us really close despite the huge gulf of things we can\u2019t talk about.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018For me, the one thing that really helps is putting it out there and having it resonate with people.\u2019 Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nRamy, Al-Kadhi\u2019s twin brother, is the only family member to have watched Al-Kadhi perform. \u201cHe\u2019s very proud of me. I think he\u2019s more in awe, to be honest \u2013 of how different my life has turned out to everyone I am related to,\u201d Al-Kadhi says.\n\nBut Ramy has not seen the book; neither have Al-Kadhi\u2019s parents. \u201cThankfully, they are not stocking it in Dubai any time soon,\u201d Al-Kadhi says. When they told their mother about the memoir, she said: \u201c\u2018Is there anything I\u2019m not going to like?\u2019 And I said: \u2018Well, you don\u2019t like the fact that I do drag, you don\u2019t like the fact that I\u2019m gay, you don\u2019t like the fact that I wear pink socks. So you are not going to like most of this book \u2026 I don\u2019t know if I will have a relationship with them after this.\u201d\n\nSo why do it?\n\n\u201cI have had all kinds of therapy, meds, everything,\u201d Al-Kadhi says. \u201cFor me, the one thing that really helps is putting it out there and having it resonate with people \u2026 I said to my mum: \u2018It\u2019s my only coping mechanism.\u2019 It stops me from doing something quite dangerous to myself. I didn\u2019t have a choice. I had to write it.\u201d They are pulling at the top of their hoodie again \u2013 nervously, I assume. But Al-Kadhi smiles and says what they are really doing is touching the rump of the unicorn beneath.\n\nUnicorn: The Memoir of a Muslim Drag Queen is published by HarperCollins.
