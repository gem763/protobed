Let us be clear: stopping a no-deal Brexit is vital but stopping Brexit altogether must be the goal.\n\nThe reason, after all, why parliament has not been able to agree a deal is because Brexit in the form it was promised is impossible to deliver. So Brexit IS the problem, whether it is of the Tory variety or the alternative Labour Brexit deal Jeremy Corbyn says he will negotiate if Labour takes office.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats rule nothing out when it comes to stopping Brexit, the first stage of which is to stop no deal. We are working closely with others to do this \u2013 yet many of them (such as former chancellor Philip Hammond) still want to leave the EU with some kind of deal.\n\nIf the last three years have taught us anything, it is that there is no deal which compares to EU membership \u2013 that is why we are unequivocally the UK\u2019s biggest and strongest Remain party.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.\" Shutterstock / sasha2109\n\nThe focus of efforts this week will be legislating to stop the country crashing out of the EU without a deal by securing an Article 50 extension and we are optimistic that this can be achieved. It is important that we are clear how long an extension should be, so it can\u2019t be avoided by the government \u2013 it would need to last at least two months for a general election to take place and a further five-six months for a new referendum.\n\nIf the length of extension is vague and unspecified the government will simply apply to extend for, say, a further 12 hours and then claim the legal requirements to ask for one have been satisfied.\n\nWe also need to be clear on the purpose. We want an extension to give the people a final say on this sorry mess. If, as an alternative, it was for a general election then that election must take place before the scheduled date of Brexit, with a view to any new government holding a people\u2019s vote on the issue.\n\nI know there are some who would rather not talk about the purpose of an extension for fear of exposing divisions in their parties (namely the Labour Party) but you cannot claim to want to stop a no-deal Brexit if you are not prepared to contemplate the means. Ultimately, you can only stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal by voting for a deal or by voting in some way to stop Brexit altogether \u2013 this is a choice which cannot be ducked.\n\nIn spite of all the above, the lesson of the last three months has been that too often the voices of sanity and reason have found themselves put on the back foot by a ruthless and determined No 10.\n\nWe saw from the Vote Leave campaign that the group now running this government is prepared to lie, cheat and break the rules to win at any cost. This is not hyperbole \u2013 the Vote Leave campaign was found to have broken the law by the Electoral Commission and Boris Johnson, its leading figurehead, was publicly reprimanded by the chair of the UK Statistics Authority for his claim that \u00a3350m extra per week could be spent on the NHS as a consequence of Brexit. We can all see they have shown they are prepared to disregard the usual constitutional conventions in this country.\n\nEven if the Commons successfully legislates this week, we cannot presume a further extension will even be granted \u2013 it is likely, though not guaranteed.\n\nThere is a lot of ill will towards the Johnson administration in EU capitals given the Brexiteers\u2019 general behaviour towards our closest friends and allies. And there is a risk that Johnson\u2019s fellow right-wing nationalist leaders on the European Council do his bidding to facilitate a no-deal Brexit in some way.\n\nThis is why the Commons must also look at ways to ensure parliament has the opportunity to revoke Article 50 if necessary \u2013 as an insurance policy. Again, there are some who would prefer not to mention \u201crevoking\u201d but this is also an issue which cannot be ducked as more than 6 million people have illustrated by signing the biggest ever parliamentary petition calling for it.\n\nThere has been much chat about the various utterances of cabinet ministers who decried a no-deal Brexit and now have taken a different view because it suits their personal political interests \u2013 Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock, Amber Rudd and Nicky Morgan all come to mind. But perhaps the most important was that of Michael Gove, writing in the Brexit-supporting Daily Mail, on 10 March this year.\n\nGove said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t vote to leave without a deal. That wasn\u2019t the message of the campaign I helped lead.\u201d Even he concedes that the disgraceful no-deal project of which he is now a central figure, has no mandate. If even he accepts this \u2013 surely this whole sorry saga of Brexit must be abandoned altogether? So, by all means rail against a no-deal Brexit, but stopping it from happening will be a job half done if we don\u2019t stop Brexit altogether.\n\nChuka Umunna is the Liberal Democrat MP for Streatham", "description": "The House of Commons returns tomorrow for a momentous constitutional battle between a Conservative government, hijacked by a Brexit elite (the 2016 Vote Leave campaign team), and the representatives of the people, democratically elected to parliament in 2017.", "authors": ["Chuka Umunna"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/02/15/istock-486473485.jpg"}
