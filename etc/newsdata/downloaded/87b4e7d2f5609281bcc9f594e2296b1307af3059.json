It\u2019s a very positive relationship.\u201d\n\nGreenland is gaining attention as global superpowers including China, Russia and the United States look toward the Arctic region for mineral resources and strategic waterways.\n\nA defense treaty between NATO allies Denmark and the United States dating back to 1951 gives the U.S. military rights over the Thule Air Base in northern Greenland.\n\nAfter Trump canceled his planned meeting with his Danish counterpart in August, Greenland\u2019s foreign minister Ane Lone Bagger told Reuters: \u201cWe are open for business, but we\u2019re not for sale.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. military has conducted an aerial survey of Greenland to assess the vast arctic island's mineral potential as part of an agreement between the two governments, a top U.S. diplomat said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Noah Browning", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
