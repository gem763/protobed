It is especially painful that this is happening at a moment when the new Ukrainian leadership desperately needs a functional partnership with Washington.\n\nWith the victory of Volodymyr Zelensky in this year\u2019s presidential and parliamentary elections, Ukrainians got one more chance at fighting corruption by making further reforms to the judiciary and the prosecutor general\u2019s office. Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian who won more than 70 percent of the vote, has promised not to run for a second term. Some of his first steps have been encouraging: He appointed a new professional and trusted team at the prosecutor general\u2019s office \u2014 an especially important change, given how often prosecutions have been wielded as political weapons in Ukraine \u2014 and he has empowered anti-corruption bodies.\n\nBut the prospects for rule of law and a corruption-free administration in Ukraine remain fragile; many are concerned, for instance, about the influence of oligarchs on Mr. Zelensky\u2019s agenda.\n\nAnd Ukraine remains in a precarious position. Crimea is still under Russian control, and the war in the east continues; the fight against corruption at home is also not yet won. In all of these matters, Ukraine is reliant on bipartisan American support, which is why our leadership is desperate to avoid becoming part of the American presidential campaign.", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to warp our judicial process for his own ends is a grievous offense against a country that is desperately fighting corruption.", "authors": ["Alyona Getmanchuk"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/opinion/24getmanchuk/24getmanchuk-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
