The Financial Times said SoftBank was worried that a low price would affect its other fundraising projects.\n\nBut on Tuesday, CNBC reported that WeWork intended to forge ahead with its roadshow, in which the company pitches itself to potential investors.\n\nSoftBank chief Masayoshi Son has praised WeWork, arguing that its profitability will surge after a period of loss-making expansion.\n\nBut critics say WeWork's model could leave it vulnerable during an economic downturn.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How can a company be valued at billions, but not make any profit?\n\nThe company rents office space for the long-term, subletting that space to firms and individuals on more flexible lease terms. That could leave it on the hook for lease payments even if tenants grow scarce.\n\nWeWork has also faced questions about its complicated financial ties to founder chief executive, Adam Neumann, who would retain voting control of the company.\n\nLast week, Mr Neumann returned $5.9m worth of stock to the firm, which he had controversially received in exchange for his trademark of \"We\".\n\nConcerns about slowing global growth could also contribute to a bumpy ride in the public markets, as seen in other high-profile offerings this year, such as Uber.\n\nSince WeWork's start in New York in 2010, it has expanded to more than 500 locations in 111 cities across 29 countries.\n\nThe growth has been costly. WeWork lost about $1.6bn last year, despite revenue nearly doubling.", "description": "One of the most hotly-anticipated financial events of the year is said to face growing scepticism.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/88EA/production/_104205053_wework_index_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
