(Tony Avelar/AP)\n\nOn the night Keith Green disappeared, he left to meet the mother of his children at a pancake house and never came back.\n\nThey were fighting about the children and money, locked in a custody dispute after a bitter breakup. His ex-girlfriend, Tiffany Li, was the heiress of a Chinese real estate fortune. Green, 27, was an aspiring chef, an ex-high school football star from a blue-collar neighborhood in San Mateo, Calif., about 20 miles south of San Francisco.\n\nNow he was struggling. Li had kicked him out of the enormous mansion where she lived with their two children in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in America, a multi-million-dollar fortress in Hillsborough, Calif., with French doors opening to balconies in the bedrooms and landscaping more fitting of a country club.\n\nBut on the night of April 28, 2016, prosecutors say, instead of going inside for pancakes, Li invited him back home. It was a trick, prosecutors said. Once there, Li\u2019s new boyfriend, Kaveh Bayat, allegedly shot him through the mouth in the garage, and paid Li\u2019s security guard to dump Green\u2019s body on the side of a dirt road.\n\nThat\u2019s the theory prosecutors presented Monday during opening arguments in Li and Bayat\u2019s high-profile murder trial, painting the wealthy mother as selfish and greed-driven and arguing she ordered a hit on Green so she could get rid of him and win the custody battle on her own terms.\n\nBut Li\u2019s attorneys contend prosecutors don\u2019t even have the right people on trial, and that instead, Green\u2019s kidnapping and murder was all the work of one person: the bodyguard, Olivier Adella \u2014 the only one who has admitted his involvement in the killing.\n\nNow, in a trial expected to last through mid-November, jurors will be asked to interpret heaps of largely circumstantial evidence and traces of blood and DNA evidence to decide which theory they believe.\n\n\u201cAs soon as Keith went missing, fingers pointed at Tiffany,\u201d defense attorney May Mar said in a nearly three-hour opening statement, the Associated Press reported. \u201cThey had a custody issue. It\u2019s clear their relationship was not so contentious that she ever would have wanted him harmed or killed.\u201d\n\nNo murder weapon has been recovered. But prosecutors said Monday they will rely on cellphone records placing Green at Li\u2019s mansion on the night of the killing, gunshot residue found in her garage and blood found in her Mercedes and in Adella\u2019s vehicle to make the case, the AP reported.\n\nLi, 33, and Bayat, 32, have both pleaded not guilty to the murder charges, the Mercury News reported. Adella, 44, took a plea deal on charges of accessory to murder in exchange for his testimony against the couple, saying they ordered him to dump the body. He will no longer testify after trying to reach a defense witness on Instagram last week, in violation of the plea agreement, according to the Mercury News.\n\nLi\u2019s case drew national interest in 2017 after she posted $66 million bail, among the largest amounts ever in U.S. history. Fearing Li\u2019s family wealth in China made her a serious flight risk, a judge ordered her bail set at $35 million. Li and her mother\u2019s business associates and wealthy friends raised $4 million in cash and then had to post double the remaining amount with $62 million worth of property bonds to secure her release. Li\u2019s attorneys argued the raised funds indicated many believed she was innocent.\n\n\u201cFriends, distant relatives, business associates who are willing to risk their houses for this woman,\u201d Li\u2019s defense lawyer Geoff Carr told KGO at the time.\n\nSince then, she has remained on house arrest in the same Hillsborough mansion where prosecutors allege she and Bayat killed Green.\n\nLi and Green met in 2009 and soon moved into the mansion, valued at $7 million and owned by Li\u2019s mother \u2014 although the couple couldn\u2019t have been more different, the AP reported.\n\nBorn in Beijing, Li grew up in Silicon Valley, attending prestigious schools before joining her mother\u2019s business after college. Her mother, Li Jihong, amassed the family fortune in Beijing in the 1980s through joint ventures with construction companies owned by the Chinese military, according to the Financial Times.\n\nBy contrast, Green grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Silicon Valley\u2019s shadow, raised by a single mom, the AP reported. After dropping out of college, he flitted between stints of unemployment and temp work. To help get him on track, Li\u2019s mother started paying his $40,000 a year tuition to attend culinary school, the AP reported.\n\nHe and Li had two daughters, born in 2012 and 2014. But the couple\u2019s relationship evaporated after Li started having an affair with another man: Bayat, Green\u2019s former friend.\n\nBayat moved in. Green was kicked out. And the custody dispute that would end in Green\u2019s death began, prosecutors said.\n\n\u201cAs he kept asking for more money, she got angry,\u201d San Mateo County prosecutor Bryan Abanto told jurors Monday, the AP reported. \u201cShe told her friends, \u2018He\u2019s just about the money, not about the kids.' \u201d\n\nAccording to documents obtained by KGO, text messages sent months before the killing showed Green asking for Li\u2019s new BMW, $4,000 a month and $20,000 for furniture, saying he wanted to \u201ccreate a life that is parallel to yours with the kids.\u201d Li sent that exchange to Bayat.\n\n\u201cHe was tyn 2 work u 4 money agin!!!\" Bayat responded to her, according to KGO. \u201cThat\u2019s all he wants. Its not about the kids.\u201d\n\nShortly thereafter, prosecutors argued, the two began a sinister plot \u2014 and that\u2019s where Adella, the bodyguard, came in.\n\nAdella admitted his involvement in an interview with KGO in 2017, explaining how the entire plot unfolded. The mixed martial arts fighter, who said he worked as Bayat and Li\u2019s bodyguard and personal trainer, recalled the day in February 2016, when Bayat recruited him for a $50,000 job during a meeting in the mansion\u2019s \u201cman cave.\u201d\n\nBayat allegedly said, \u201cI want you to get rid of Keith Green.\u201d Adella asked what he meant. \u201cWe want you to pretty much kill Keith Green,\u201d Bayat said, Adella claims.\n\nAdella said he refused.\n\nMonths later, he said he was wrangled into the murder anyway.\n\nOn the night of Green\u2019s killing, Adella said he watched Li meet with Green at the Millbrae Pancake House, on Bayat\u2019s orders, and then went home. Hours later, Adella claimed, Li and Bayat showed up in his driveway \u2014 allegedly with Green\u2019s dead body in the car.\n\n\u201cI need you to take out the trash,\u201d Bayat allegedly told him, AP reported.\n\nAdella then put Green\u2019s body in his own car and drove down Highway 101 to a remote area, dumping the body in a ditch. Prosecutors say he was paid $35,000 for the dirty work.\n\nBut Li\u2019s defense attorneys say his story is a lie, concocted to pin the killing on Lin and Bayat and deflect blame from himself. They argue it was a botched kidnapping, though have not revealed a theory on the motive.\n\n\u201cThey have the wrong people on trial,\u201d Mar said, according to KGO. \u201cWho they should be pursuing is Mr. Olivier Adella. That\u2019s been clear from day one.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for Adella couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment.\n\nSince Li was charged in Green\u2019s death, she lost custody of her and Green\u2019s two children. Green\u2019s mother and Li\u2019s mother have split custody, according to the San Mateo Daily Journal.", "description": "Tiffany Li's drew national interest after she posted a $66 million bond, among the largest in U.S. history.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter", "September At Am", "Meagan Flynn Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
