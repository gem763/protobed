So municipal officials bought up empty houses, then offered up the nominally-priced properties to the global market in order to attract new people.\n\nIt worked. After enquiries from all over the world \u2013 from artists, dancers, musicians and more \u2013 Sambuca\u2019s new residents are fixing up the houses and moving in. The renovation investment is the only requirement of these purchases, which are giving a diverse group of international buyers a new place to call home.\n\nSambuca\u2019s mayor, Leonardo Ciaccio, is very pleased to see the empty houses transforming into thriving homes. \u201cIt all worked out very nicely,\u201d he says.", "description": "For many, it\u2019s a dream to live in Italy.
