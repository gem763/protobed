He was in Monaco and I wanted to sign for PSG. When I arrived here, also his name was on the table to achieve to sign him, but he signed for Liverpool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The first six months he didn\u2019t play, it was adaptation. But now he is amazing and I want the same with Ceballos, with Pepe.\n\n\u2018We need patience, but Pepe is improving, but on Monday, the key to win was with him. If he scores the first goal, it\u2019s different.\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s one process and I believe in him and I know we need time and patience. The supporters have patience, some more than others.\n\n\u2018But I know we are convinced. We are going to fight to convince them and tomorrow to show another 90 minutes at the Emirates and then on Sunday.\u2019\n\nThe scrutiny on Emery has intensified this week following the Gunners\u2019 dismal 1-0 defeat to Sheffield United on Monday.\n\nJamie Carragher accused the Spaniard of failing to improve the club during the last 18 months and says Arsenal are no better now than they were under Arsene Wenger.\n\nBut Emery disagrees.\n\n\u2018In my career it\u2019s normal to have difficult moments and criticism for our work and my job,\u2019 said Emery.\n\n\u2018We are in one point of view. The supporters point of view and their opinion, we need to accept that\u2019.\n\nMORE: Frank Lampard \u2018very, very happy\u2019 with Christian Pulisic after impact in Chelsea\u2019s win against Ajax", "description": "Arsenal boss Unai Emery has revealed the club wanted to sign Liverpool star Fabinho during his first summer at the club.
