\u2013\n\nAs external headwinds have grown fiercer, calls from the ECB for governments to loosen their purse strings have grown louder.\n\n\u201cThe ECB is rightly worried about the balance between monetary and fiscal policy\u201d after years fighting its battles almost alone, economist Christian Odendahl of the Centre for European Reform told AFP.\n\nWith the governing council divided over further stimulus and threats from abroad, rather than at home, weighing heaviest, former IMF chief Lagarde \u201cwill have to call for fiscal support to fulfil the ECB\u2019s mandate\u201d on inflation, he added.\n\nIn her European Parliament confirmation hearing last month, she harked back to Draghi\u2019s 2012 promise to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro.\n\n\u201cI hope I will never have to say something like that, I really do, because if I had it would mean the other economic policy makers are not doing what they have to do,\u201d Lagarde told the Brussels lawmakers.\n\nLater in September, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said governments shouldn\u2019t \u201coverstretch\u201d monetary policy in an apparent recognition of the ECB\u2019s woes.", "description": "Frankfurt am Main (AFP) \u2013 Departing European Central Bank president Mario Draghi will leave a conflicting legacy after chairing his final governing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/ed0b01_european-central-bank-president-mario-draghi-is-credited-saving-euro-but-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
