In a new CBC Gem series, we're looking to find out.\n\nDrake's Plan is an eight-part documentary series starting Oct. 24 with a new episode added to CBC Gem weekly, exploring how Drake solidified himself as one of the savviest icons in the game. CBC-TV will air an abridged version of the series as a 90-minute special on Dec. 10.\n\nIn episode 1, which is available now, we look at how Drake met his dream team. Toronto rapper Saukrates takes us back to his early work with Drake, which introduced the up-and-coming star to Noah Shebib, a.k.a. 40 \u2014 now Drake's musical right-hand man. We also learn how remixing Divine Brown's \"Twist my Hair\" led Drake to producer Boi-1da, who's since worked on dozens of tracks for the rapper, including his breakthrough hit, \"Best I Ever Had.\" You'll also get a glimpse into what Drake was like on the set of Degrassi those early years, thanks to Andrea Desiree Lewis, a.k.a. one of Jimmy's love interests, Hazel.\n\nGet a sneak peek at the episode below, and head to CBC Gem to watch the full thing.
