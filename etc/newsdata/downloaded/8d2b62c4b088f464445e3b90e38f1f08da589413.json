Boden, the founder and chief executive officer of Starling Bank, based in Britain, had been wondering why her customers were mostly men. Looking for clues, she noticed that the women\u2019s magazines focused on saving money and deal hunting, while the men\u2019s talked about money in terms of power and luxury.\n\n\u201cThe next day, I walked into my office and made a joke about spending too much on shoes,\u201d she said. She had a light bulb moment: \u201cIf a woman who was so confident with money that she started her own bank was making fun of her frivolous spending \u2026 Had I been influenced by these magazines my whole life?\u201d\n\nShe commissioned a study on the gendered language around money \u2014 and found that 65 percent of financial articles in women\u2019s magazines categorized women as excessive spenders. Of those aimed at men, 70 percent emphasized making money. \u201cWomen are told to cut back on coffee to save up for a new pair of shoes,\u201d Boden said. \u201cWith men, money is all about power suits and investing and long-term goals. Supercars and yachts and people looking quite smug.\u201d\n\nMoney isn\u2019t gendered, but men and women deal with it quite differently. Women spend more than men on apparel, according to Smartasset, a financial technology company. But men spend more on other things, like takeout, and, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, alcohol and cars. Over all, single men spend slightly more than women, but that may also be because they outearn women. Frivolous spending has nothing to do with gender. Nevertheless, the myth of the frivolous female spender won\u2019t seem to go away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a vicious cycle,\u201d Boden said. \u201cThe media talks about women and money in a certain way, so the people reading it start talking that way, too. It\u2019s what sticks in your mind.\u201d In other words, perhaps women become more interested than men in pinching pennies and more embarrassed about their frivolous spending because it\u2019s how we\u2019ve been socialized.", "description": "Women buy shoes, men buy power \u2014 or so goes the trope.
