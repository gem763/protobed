As of March, half of Trump\u2019s approval polls during his time in office had him between 39 and 44 percent. Since then, his average approval has hovered between 41 and 43 percent.\n\nGiven the consistency of Trump\u2019s approval rating, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the latest downward trend. It could tick back up a notch or two before too long. At the same time, his approval rating was mediocre, even when it sat a couple points higher, so steadiness isn\u2019t exactly a great sign for Trump. If it doesn\u2019t notably improve, Trump\u2019s approval might sink him in 2020.", "description": "", "authors": ["Geoffrey Skelley", "Fivethirtyeight.Com Features Whats-Going-On-With-Trumps-Approval-Rating"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
