The project, called UpGarden, takes this experience to the rooftop, creating a 30,000 square-foot showcase for how an edible landscape \u2014 and new neighbor connections \u2014 can emerge from a parking lot.\n\nDesigned and built in seven months on a $150,000 budget, the community-run roof garden was created by designer Nicole Kistler, landscape architect Eric Higbee, the community of Queen Anne/Uptown and the P-Patch Program of Seattle.\n\nThe location\n\nThe urban Uptown/lower Queen Anne neighborhood previously lacked any community gardening space. A voter-passed measure in 2008 prioritized the neighborhood for a community garden.\n\nAffordable open lots aren\u2019t the easiest to find, so the project\u2019s creators looked up \u2014 to a parking structure at the Seattle Center. Working with a structural engineer was key, says Higbee.\n\nThe community\n\nHigbee and Kistler held three community design meetings over the course of a few months. The community\u2019s continued enthusiasm and commitment to the project floored the designers.\n\nThese meetings produced a sense of strong ownership of the garden and the neighborhood as a whole.\n\nThe design. Not surprisingly, few precedents exist for parking garage community gardens. Together the community decided on everything, from the design and engineering to how the plots were assigned and managed. Things had to be durable and affordable, and also needed to stay on the roof.\n\nDrainage is a major concern in all landscape architecture projects. This is compounded on rooftop gardens, where load is also a concern \u2014 consider soil, which can weigh more than 100 pounds per square foot, on a parking structure designed to hold 40 pounds per square foot. The crowning of the garage and the overall slope of the space dictated the design and program needs. Two wide paths run the length of the garden where the roof can hold the least amount of weight.\n\nKistler says they turned to traditional agricultural models that used terracing to deal with slope \u2014 rice paddies, contour plowing etc. Softly undulating terraces work across the parking garage.\n\nOne hundred plots, 100 square feet each, were distributed according to volunteer hours. A community lawn area was designed as well as a communal growing space for food banks. The community proposed converting an Airstream trailer into a toolshed, and one of the members found one.\n\nThe construction\n\nThe parking garage is slated for demolition as part of Seattle\u2019s master plan, but that could be in a few years, even a decade. Kistler notes that because of the uncertain future of the garden, deconstruction was a key consideration.\n\nNo structural changes could be made to the garage. The planters and terraces are made of FSC-certified cedar planks and lined with filter fabric. Everything is firmly fixed but also portable and reusable for the next UpGarden location.\n\nThis garden, like most community projects, is primarily volunteer driven \u2014 including construction. In addition to the contractors who pressure washed the roof and set posts for the terraces, the community was responsible for the rest of the building. A lot of triple and quadruple checking of tasks happened, says Higbee, but this project goes to show how simple materials, hard work and focused design can go a long way.\n\nA 50-year celebration\n\nThe Mercer Street Parking Garage and Seattle Center were built for the World\u2019s Fair in 1962, at a time when the space race and car culture signified innovation.\n\nFifty years later, we can still celebrate the innovation taking place here. This garden, built during the Seattle Center\u2019s Next 50 anniversary celebration, can be seen as an exploration of a sustainable future for our cities.\n\nKistler visits the garden often to see how the community continues to enjoy it. Residents look out for one another and learn with one another, she says. While many had some urban gardening experience, rooftop farming is a whole other game \u2014 from drying winds to intense sunlight and reflected heat \u2014 and it\u2019s one they are exploring together.\n\n\u201cCommunity Thrives Along With a Garage-Top Garden\u201d by Annie Thornton originally appeared on Houzz.com, a platform that connects you with local landscape design professionals and more information on urban gardens.
