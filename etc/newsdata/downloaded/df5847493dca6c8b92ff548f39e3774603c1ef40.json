She ends up in a coma for three weeks which was fantastic.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"After doing all these epic monologues in front of everybody, I literally go into a coma for three weeks so it's like three blocks of me laid in bed all day.\n\n\"Way too much Internet shopping... there was nothing else to do, but I got to lay in bed for three weeks.\"\n\nWhile revealing there would be no \"long-term\" injuries for the character, appearing to confirm she will survive, viewers could expect her to be different in the aftermath.\n\n(Image: Channel 4 PA)\n\nJennifer said: \"There's nothing [long-term], but I think it's a real turning point in her life, and she\u2019s gonna have to kick back and think about her life if it comes to this... if it comes to someone shooting her.\n\n\"There's been a lot that's gone on in such a short amount of time. I think, and I don\u2019t know this, but there should be a gear change with the character after this.\n\n\"It's got to have after effects and I think she needs to take a serious look at herself. I'll be excited for that, as long as it isn\u2019t too nice!\"\n\n(Image: Channel 4 PA)\n\n(Image: Channel 4 PA)\n\nKeep up with all the soap news Life moves fast in soapland, so make sure you stay up to date with all the latest from your favourite soaps with our regular email newsletter.
