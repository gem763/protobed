Fairfax Media\n\n\"The current system creates some really perverse outcomes where women are paying to work. Earning just one extra dollar can cause a family to lose up to $5000 of subsidy,\" she said.\n\nFor example, a mother earning the full-time equivalent of $100,000 per year whose spouse earns $100,000 per annum would take home just an extra $5000 a year by increasing her work days from three to four.\n\nWorse, the family goes backwards by $4200 a year if she increased her working days from four to five.\n\nBig productivity boost\n\nKPMG proposes capping the work disincentive rate for the secondary earner \u2013 usually a woman \u2013 at the marginal income tax rate, plus 20 percentage points, creating a progressive system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This would benefit households across the income scale, but especially those at modest incomes who can least afford to be prevented from working more hours,\" Ms Kitchen said.\n\nKPMG's lead tax partner Grant Wardell\u2010Johnson said its alternative proposal was for the government to provide additional assistance for families with more than one child in long-day care.\n\nThe subsidy reimburses a maximum of 85 per cent of the childcare costs for each child. KPMG suggests that for the second (and any additional) child in simultaneous long-day care, the subsidy should be increased to 100 per cent for all households, regardless of their income.\n\n\"Given Australia\u2019s weak productivity performance, it is crucial that we make better use of the skills and experience of many parents who have taken time out of the workforce to bring up children,\" Mr Wardell\u2010Johnson said.\n\n\u201cOur economic modelling in this report shows the proposals would generate an additional $678 million \u2013 using conservative assumptions \u2013 at a cost of $368 million in extra CCS spending.\"\n\nMs Morphett said increased affordability of childcare would be a key enabler of greater parental equality in our society.\n\n\u201cReducing financial disincentives for parents seeking to work full-time is paramount,\" she said.\n\n\"If we aspire to have equal workforce participation and leadership progression we must ensure men and women are equally empowered, socially and financially, to share the income-generating and care-giving roles.\u201d", "description": "A new report finds more than 125,000 working mothers are being penalised for choosing to work more days.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9521%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_310%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6cde4dd5c0a18a54a763c1b38feac292b5fc56af", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
