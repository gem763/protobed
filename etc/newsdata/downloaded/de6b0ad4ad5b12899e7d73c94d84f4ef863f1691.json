And \u201chow did you get here?\u201d would seem terribly rude.\n\nSo I mentally batted it away by telling myself she must have family nearby or got herself a work visa somehow.\n\nThere was clearly a very good, legal and happy reason for her arrival in the UK. So I went back to the tricky business of trying to decide between shades of blue.\n\nAnd then last Friday \u2013 five miles from my house \u2013 39 young people were found dead in a refrigerated lorry having endured the most unimaginable ends.\n\n(Image: SWNS.com)\n\nSoon beforehand, Pham Thi Tra My, 26, texted her mum: \u201cMy path abroad has not succeeded. Mum, I love you so much. I\u2019m dying because I can\u2019t breath.\u201d\n\nSuddenly it felt the colour on my hands and those of the thousands of British women using Vietnamese nail bars, was a terrible shade of crimson.\n\nThe grieving families have already told how women among those who made the deadly journey were doing so in the hope of finding a job in a UK nail bar. Others would have ended up working in restaurants or illegal cannabis farms.\n\nThey were hoping for a new life and the chance to send money back to debt-ridden families at home. Duped by criminal traffickers they were sold a dream which ended in nightmare.\n\nThis terrible case has been a brutal wake-up call to the danger and criminality that lies just below the surface of our daily lives. How all around us there are people who have risked everything for a part in our booming black economy.\n\nThey are the cleaners, workers and gig economy drivers on whom the rest of us have been able to enjoy more comfort at less cost.\n\nSome will say it\u2019s an unavoidable by-product of globalisation as the wealth of some nations exerts an ever stronger \u2018pull factor\u2019 to those trapped in poverty elsewhere on our shrinking planet.\n\nBut we cannot keep turning a blind eye to the human misery which gets nails painted, cars washed, cheap clothes made and takeaways delivered in the early hours.\n\nIt\u2019s time we all start asking.\n\ndifficult questions \u2013 and there can be nowhere better to start than asking them of ourselves.", "description": "We cannot keep turning a blind eye to the human misery which gets nails painted, cars washed, cheap clothes made and takeaways delivered in the early hours", "authors": ["Alison Phillips", "Image", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20751003.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Pham-Thi-Tra-My.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
