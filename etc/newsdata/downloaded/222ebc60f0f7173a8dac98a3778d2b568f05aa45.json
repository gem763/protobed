The 129 pages long document explains in detail how the rules under which the exchange operates would need to change and how the platform would work.\n\nAccording to the proposal, the security ownership records will be stored on the Ethereum blockchain and would be updated at the end of each trading day. The exchange would operate between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. EST.\n\nA closed system on a public blockchain\n\nPer the application, only the whitelisted Ethereum addresses would have access to the service, which means BSTX and its authorized operators who the company calls \u201cwallet managers.\u201d\n\nThe listed tokens would also need to be compliant with the ERC-20 standard with the addition of some security features and three smart contracts meant to track ownership, whitelisted addresses and compliance with regulations.\n\nAs Cointelegraph recently reported, security token offerings, or STOs, have more or less taken the mantle of their semi-defunct counterpart \u2014 initial coin offerings.", "description": "Boston Security Token Exchange, a platform jointly owned by BOX Digital Markets and tZERO, seeks the U.S. SEC\u2019s approval to launch a market for security tokens", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNGU4ZTcwYjQ3N2JjNDdjYzBjMDY4OWE4ZTY2YTQwM2MuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
