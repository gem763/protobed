Harold \u201cPie\u201d Keller was one of the six men in the photo, not Pfc. Rene Gagnon, as previously thought.\n\nKeller passed away in 1979.\n\nHis recognition marks the second change in recent years to the cast of the classic Pulitzer Prize-winning picture, one of most recognizable images in U.S. history.\n\nThree years ago, the Marine Corps determined that Pfc. Harold Schultz, not Navy hospital corpsman John Bradley, was one of the six men in the photo.\n\n\u201cWithout the initiative and contributions of both private historians devoted to preservation of our history and the FBI\u2019s Digital Evidence Laboratory, the Marine Corps would not have this opportunity to expand on the historical record of the second flag raising on Mount Suribachi,\u201d the Marine Corps said in a statement to NBC News.\n\n\u201cRegardless of who was in the photograph, each and every Marine who set foot on Iwo Jima, or supported the effort from the sea and air around the island is, and always will be, a part of our Corps\u2019 cherished history,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cIn the words of General David H. Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps, \u2018they are all heroes.\u2019\u201d\n\nStephen Foley, Dustin Spence and Brent Westemeyer are the three researchers whose work led to the change.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
