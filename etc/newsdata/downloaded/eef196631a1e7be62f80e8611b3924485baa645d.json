Classmates say he was the target of bullies.", "language": "en", "text": "Families in the 33,000-student Moreno Valley Unified School District reacted with grief and outrage after the attack. Parents and students gathered last Friday in a \u201cDitch for Diego\u201d protest that went from a nearby community park to the district\u2019s registration office. Diego\u2019s death on Tuesday night prompted more memorials, vigils \u2014 and heated confrontations with district officials whom some parents and students accuse of mishandling what they call a pervasive bullying problem.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Mavericks, The Bears, & The Falcons all came together tonight to honor Diego...his words were spot on & I pray we as parents and that our kids as well can make the change that' is needed to stop bullying. R.I.P Diego \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f I hope you all hug your babies a little harder tonight Posted by Leticia Lopez on Wednesday, September 25, 2019\n\nFacebook video of the attack shows Diego facing a taller boy who briefly looks away before suddenly punching Diego in the head. A second boy quickly follows with a blow that appears to knock Diego\u2019s head into a concrete pillar. The first boy then punches Diego, now on the ground, as students can be heard gasping and screaming.\n\nDiego\u2019s classmates told TV station KTLA the boy had been bullied before, including on social media.\n\nMore students are being bullied online, federal report says\n\nThe two boys accused of attacking Diego were arrested and face the juvenile court equivalent of assault charges, the Riverside County District Attorney\u2019s Office told The Washington Post. Neither boy has been named since they\u2019re both minors. The initial hearings for each boy are set for Oct. 2 and Oct. 15 respectively. John Hall, a spokesman for the prosecutor\u2019s office, said charges could be amended or added as the office receives new information in the investigation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne parent with the Moreno Valley Unified School District said the past week has been an emotional one for students and parents in the community. Mixed in with the grief over Diego\u2019s death is frustration that the school district hasn\u2019t done enough to address their concerns for students\u2019 safety.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all very furious. We\u2019re obviously mourning the death of this child,\u201d parent Karla Palumbo, 40, told The Post. \u201cAnd more than anything, [families in the school district] want justice. The community has had enough.\u201d\n\nPalumbo\u2019s three children attend schools in the same district as Landmark and said they\u2019ve experienced bullying incidents that the district at large failed to respond to in an adequate way. One of her daughters, now 14, would come home from elementary school with bruises after her classmates verbally and physically abused her, Palumbo said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBullied boy who designed University of Tennessee T-shirt just got free tuition to the college\n\n\u201c[Bullying] is all over the Moreno Valley school district. My daughter, still to this day, has been getting bullied \u2014 and not only by students, but by teachers,\u201d Palumbo said. \u201cYou can see staff walking by these fights, and they don\u2019t step in, they just walk away.\"\n\nThe Moreno Valley Unified School District didn\u2019t immediately respond to written requests for comment on the accusations of pervasive bullying. The Post also reached out for information on the district\u2019s protocols for how teachers and staff are expected to handle bullying and on security and safety measures at Landmark and other district schools.\n\nAsk Amy: A bully\u2019s behavior must be dealt with\n\nMoreno Valley Unified School District Superintendent Martinrex Kedziora addressed concerns during a news conference Wednesday and insisted the district has measures in place to keep students \u201csafer than they\u2019ve ever been.\u201d Kedziora said there were more security personnel at Landmark, more mental health resources available to students and a tip line where students can report bullying. Teachers, he said, were more vigilant in looking out for warning signs of potential violence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, Kedziora declined to say if he thought Diego\u2019s death was preventable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still under investigation, so I really can\u2019t comment on that at this time,\u201d he said.\n\nThings got intense at Diego\u2019s vigil between community members and Moreno Valley Unified School District Superintendent Martinrex Kedziora pic.twitter.com/KHDI4OgjSO \u2014 Robert Gundran (@RobertGundran) September 26, 2019\n\nDuring a Wednesday night vigil for Diego at Landmark, students and parents confronted the superintendent, whom some have called on to resign.\n\n\u201cWe came here for Diego, and we came here for the community and our children,\u201d parent Mia Carino, who has a child expected to attend Landmark in a few years, said, according to the Press Enterprise. Kedziora \u201cowes us answers,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere was the security? Why did Diego\u2019s family come a week before the attack? They reported the bullying, and nothing happened.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nMattel helped define gender norms for decades with Barbie and Ken.
