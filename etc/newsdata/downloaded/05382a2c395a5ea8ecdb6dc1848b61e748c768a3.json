One Analyst Says Its Time to Lighten Up.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nIngersoll-Rand stock (IR) fell on Monday following a downgrade from Stephens, which warned that ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty could crimp earnings across the sector this quarter.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the case of an analysts aligning their view with the market price. Ingersoll-Rand is up 28% in 2019, easily ahead of the S&P 500\u2019s 17% gain, the Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2019s 14% rise, and the 17% advance seen by the Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLI). The company reported an upbeat quarter in July, and analysts also applauded the company\u2019s merger with Gardner Denver (GDI), announced this spring.\n\nOn Monday, Stephens analyst Rob McCarthy cut his rating on Ingersoll-Rand to Equal Weight from Overweight, with a $122 price target. The move comes as he also lowered his earnings per share estimates for the firm for 2019 and 2020, even as he writes that his previous estimates were already based on conservative figures.\n\nHe warns that there\u2019s concern about the growth and sustainability of the current HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) cycle, and given that the shares have already outperformed year to date, he thinks that the risk-reward is more balance now, leading him to step to the sidelines.\n\nIngersoll-Rand dropped 1.8% to $116.45 in afternoon trading.\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s downgrade of Ingersoll-Rand is part of a larger look at the industrial and electrical equipment sector, which resulted in hin trimming his estimates for a number of other companies. He cited weakness in the cycle, a deceleration of the macro backdrop, and ongoing political uncertainty\u2014all of which are making businesses more reluctant to spend\u2014for the changes. Outside the U.S., the economic picture is even less encouraging. Among his other Equal Weight-rated names, he writes that he is most worried about A.O. Smith (AOS), Lennox International (LII), and Regal Beloit (RBC) heading into earnings season.\n\nThat said, he thinks there are still some attractive names in the sector. He likes \u201cquality compounders\u201d like Roper Technologies (ROP), and Ametek (AME), and suggests buying any pullbacks in Rockwell Automation (ROK). He also thinks that Eaton (ETN) is likely to try to acquire Hubbell (HUBB), a deal he thinks could be wise.\n\nWrite to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com", "description": "Ingersoll-Rand stock fell on Monday following a downgrade from Stephens, which warned that ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty could crimp earnings across the sector this quarter.", "authors": ["Teresa Rivas"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-114551/social", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
