After Moreno imposed a 60-day state of emergency last week that legally dissolved freedom of association in the country, his government negotiated an end to the transport protests and their affiliated strikes. Moreno offered to meet with indigenous leaders for talks, but they refused, insisting instead on street violence.\n\nThe first death of the current wave of protests occurred in Azuay province, where protesters blocked the Cuenca-Molleturo-Naranjal highway. Ecuador\u2019s El Comercio identified the victim as a \u201cyouth\u201d named Ra\u00fal Chilpe who was participating in the protests when a black SUV ran him over. The driver, blocked from continuing in the direction of Guayaquil, their destination, by the protests, reportedly attempted to change directions and, in the process, ran Chilpe over.\n\nParamedics attempted to arrive on the scene but protesters refused to let their ambulance pass. El Comercio notes that at least one emergency medical officer waded through the crowd on foot to find Chilpe and offer first aid, but found Chilpe dead.\n\nIn addition to killing one of their own, the protesters have abducted 50 officers, the Ecuadorian newspaper noted, most of them soldiers sent out to impose the state of emergency and keep protesters from blocking roads. Indigenous leaders have denied mistreating the officers.\n\n\u201cThey are accompanied by the community. They have not been treated violently,\u201d Carlos Tagua, the president of the Indigenous Movement Confederation of Chimborazo, reportedly said.\n\nInterior Minister Mar\u00eda Paula Romo told reporters that police arrested 477 people in relation to the strikes on Sunday. Authorities have confirmed that many of the arrests are not related to violating the ban on public assemblies, but for rioting and looting businesses, which has become more common as the prices of basic goods increased as a result of the government stabilizing its spending.\n\nMoreno responded to the protests in a video posted to his Twitter account Sunday announcing he was open to dialogue with the protesters to hear their concerns and, presumably, modify his policies if they propose good ideas.\n\n\u201cI am committed to dialogue with you, indigenous brothers, with whom we share many causes. Let\u2019s talk about how to use the country\u2019s resources for the neediest.\u201d Moreno said. \u201cEcuadorian, do not lend yourself to be taken advantage of by those who seek chaos. Don\u2019t share fake news. Help us denounce speculation. It is time to work, to turn the page on violence, it is an opportunity to confront the future with optimism. I am committed to changing the country \u2013 but I need you, Ecuadorian, to be committed, too.\u201d\n\nEstoy decidido a dialogar con los hermanos ind\u00edgenas, con quienes compartimos causas. Hablemos sobre c\u00f3mo usar los recursos para los m\u00e1s necesitados. \u00a1Estoy decidido a cambiar el pa\u00eds, pero necesito que t\u00fa tambi\u00e9n lo est\u00e9s!#DecididosACrecer #EcuadorPa\u00edsDePaz pic.twitter.com/DdEcHCHy6N \u2014 Len\u00edn Moreno (@Lenin) October 7, 2019\n\nIn a separate video, Moreno condemned \u201cCorreistas\u201d for \u201cplundering the country \u2026 with public works that were good for nothing,\u201d a reference to his predecessor, former President Rafael Correa, whose socialist government ushered in an era of expansive corruption that made China millions in cheap oil purchases and, some allege, tied Correa to the corrupt Brazilian contractor Odebrecht, whose bribes have resulted in the imprisonment of dozens of politicians in Brazil, Peru, Argentina, Colombia, and other states. Venezuela has not arrested anyone implicated in Odebrecht bribes because of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s close ties to the company.\n\n\u201cI am committed to sanctioning those Correistas who have taken the people\u2019s money away \u2026 those who stole the money used on works that were good for nothing,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cI am also always ready to speak, to lend my hand to decent people, to honest people who really want to change the country.\u201d\n\nCorrea, a fugitive hiding in Belgium after a judge ordered his arrest for the abduction of an opposition politician, has backed the protests and posted promotional material for a large rally in Guayaquil, the economic center of the country, on Wednesday.\n\nCorrea also referred to Moreno \u2013 who belongs to his political party and won the presidency largely due to Correa\u2019s endorsement \u2013 as \u201cthe greatest scammer of our era\u201d and his government as \u201cthe worst in history,\u201d accusing police of \u201cbrutal repression\u201d against protesters.\n\nIndigenous leaders rejected Moreno\u2019s call to talks.\n\n\u201cWe have totally closed off dialogue with the government, there is no dialogue until we get to Quito,\u201d Jaime Vargas, the head of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, said on Sunday, referring to a massive protest scheduled for Wednesday in the Ecuadorian capital. \u201cWe are not here to negotiate behind the people\u2019s backs. The people have risen and that has to be respected.\u201d\n\nMoreno\u2019s reforms began with his withdrawal from OPEC, which in theory should lower gasoline prices if Ecuadorian oil production, no longer limited by the organization, skyrockets. Moreno\u2019s government had exceeded oil output limits set by OPEC for years.\n\nMoreno then announced that, as part of a deal for a large loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), he would end a 40-year-old government gasoline subsidy, triggering the transportation professionals\u2019 revolt.", "description": "An eruption of protests in Ecuador against socially conservative economic measures resulted in the death of an injured protester Sunday.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1173508134-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
