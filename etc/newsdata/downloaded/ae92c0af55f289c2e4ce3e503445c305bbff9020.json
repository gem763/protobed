Trudeau's party also objected to having journalists participate in the debate \u2014 a sticking point they did not budge on.\n\nIn any case, Trudeau's opponents didn't agree with the decision for the Liberal leader to reject participating in a televised debate.\n\n'Trying to induce Canadians to forget'\n\nPC Leader Joe Clark was not impressed with Pierre Trudeau's decision to opt out of a proposed leaders' debate in 1980. (The National/CBC Archives)\n\n\"I regret deeply that his action has stopped Canadians from having a debate among the leaders,\" Clark said, in reaction to Trudeau's decision to turn his back on a debate.\n\n\"It's part of their policy of trying to induce Canadians to forget what Pierre Elliott Trudeau did during the 11 years he was prime minister.\"\n\nThe PC leader was referring to Trudeau's long reign as prime minister, which had been upended in the May 1979 election that saw Clark and the Progressive Conservatives take power.\n\nBut the PC government fell in December of that year, which is what triggered the pending election contest.\n\n'The height of arrogance' or shrewd strategy?\n\nNew Democrat Leader Ed Broadbent did not agree with Pierre Trudeau's decision to decline to participate in a proposed leaders' debate in 1980. (The National/CBC Archives)\n\nBroadbent said it was \"the height of arrogance\" for Trudeau to decline a debate with opposing leaders.\n\nBut the CBC's David Halton reported that Liberal party sources had acknowledged the move to have Trudeau skip the debate was \"a calculated risk,\" which was part of a strategy to keep the Liberal leader out of the spotlight as the party sought to defeat Clark.\n\nThe Tories and New Democrats kept up the pressure on Trudeau on the debate issue, but he and his party did not relent.\n\nThe Liberals, in fact, would go on to reject a revised debate proposal later in January, as shown in the report below.\n\nOn Jan. 22, 1980, The National reports on the Liberals' decision to again decline participating in a leaders' debate. 1:37\n\nIn the end, the Trudeau and the Liberals would return to power, while the Tories would form the Official Opposition.\n\nCanadians have since had a chance to see at least one televised leaders' debate for each of the 10 federal elections that have occurred since 1980.", "description": "When Canadians headed to the polls in February 1980, they were lacking something we've come to expect in modern elections \u2014 a chance to see the prospective prime ministers duke it out in a televised debate.", "authors": ["Cbc Archives"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4971736.1547058372!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/pierre-trudeau-during-the-1980-election-campaign.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-11"}
