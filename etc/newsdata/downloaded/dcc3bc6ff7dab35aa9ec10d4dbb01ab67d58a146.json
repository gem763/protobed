Per the award, McDermott will supply three complex modules for Novatek's Arctic LNG 2 project. Although the contract value is kept under wraps, the \u2018large\u2019 ones usually range between $50 million and $250 million.\n\nIn this project, McDermott\u2019s joint venture with the China Shipbuidling Industry Corporation will carry out fabrication engineering along with partial procurement, construction and pre-commissioning scope. Fabrication, which is planned to begin later this year, is expected to be completed in mid-2022 at QMW's mega module workshop as it is more secure, safer and assures successful project delivery.\n\nThe Project in Brief\n\nNovatek\u2019s Arctic LNG 2 project will have three LNG trains worth a volume of 6.6 million tonnes per year and are planned to be set up on three gravity-based structural platforms.\n\nEarlier this year, a TechnipFMC FTI-led consortium was awarded a \u00a36.1 billion contract for engineering, procurement and construction of the same project. The output of this endeavor will be supplied internationally in Europe and Asia with the help of ice-class LNG carriers. The first LNG cargo is estimated to be shipped by 2023 while the second and third trains will start moving by 2024 and 2026, respectively.\n\nRussian gas producer Novatek holds a 60% stake in the undertaking while TOTAL S.A., CNOOC Limited CEO, CNPC and Japan Artic LNG owns 10% interest each. As TOTAL itself occupies 11.6% of Novatek\u2019s shares, its overall ownership in Arctic LNG 2 adds up to 21.6%.\n\nAbout McDermott\n\nHouston, TX-based McDermott is a fully vertically integrated company providing engineering and construction solutions to energy firms.\n\nMcDermott International, Inc.
