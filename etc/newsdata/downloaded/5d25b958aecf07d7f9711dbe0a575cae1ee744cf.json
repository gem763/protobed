The forces deployed in northern Syria have been assisting the Kurdish YPG, which leads the Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTurkey considers the Kurdish-led forces, which have proved to be the U.S.'s most effective allies in its fight against ISIS, to be a terrorist insurgency.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperFurious Republicans prepare to rebuke Trump on Syria Democrats to offer resolution demanding Trump reverse Syria decision Army officer calls Syria pullback 'a stain on the American conscience' MORE confirmed on Sunday that roughly 1,000 troops would be removed from the region as part of a \u201cdeliberate withdrawal.\u201d\n\nReports surfaced later that day that hundreds of supporters of ISIS escaped a Kurdish-established detention camp after Turkish airstrikes hit the area surrounding Ain Issa, a city about 35 miles from the Turkish border.\n\nTrump's decision to remove troops has drawn backlash from both sides of the aisle, with many voicing concerns that it could lead to a resurgence for ISIS in the region.\n\nCheney said Sunday that a \"shameful disaster\" was unfolding in Syria, stating that allowing ISIS prisoners to escape confinement is \"endangering American security.\"\n\n\"I can see the appeal of argument that Syria isn\u2019t somewhere we want to be anyway, so lets leave & let Erdogan & Kurds etc. figure it out,\" Rubio tweeted. \"But our national security interests in Syria are much broader than just Turks & Kurds & on each one we are significantly worse off now.\"\n\nTrump has meanwhile vigorously defended the move, arguing that the U.S. can no longer be involved in \"endless\" wars. He tweeted early Monday that \"big sanctions\" were coming Turkey's way in light of its military offensive northern Syria.\n\nHe also suggested that Syrian Kurds targeted by Turkey may release some ISIS prisoners to get the U.S. involved in the conflict, prompting a strong rebuke from Kinzinger.\n\n\"I thought you were going to defeat ISIS, that is why people voted for you.
