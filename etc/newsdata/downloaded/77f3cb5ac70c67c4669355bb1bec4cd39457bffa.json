Trump, trying to bluster his way Wednesday through the most disastrous foreign policy debacle of his presidency, seemed to spit on the graves of more than 10,000 Kurds who died fighting to defeat the so-called Islamic State.\n\nBy moving U.S. troops in Syria out of the way, he gave a green light for Turkish forces to slaughter America\u2019s erstwhile allies while ISIS prisoners escape en masse, and the Russians take charge.\n\n\u201cSyria may have some help with Russia, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there. So, there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with. Let them fight their own wars.\u201d\n\nBut no amount of Trumpian huffing and puffing, threatening and cajoling can change the widespread view in the Middle East\u2014and in Congress\u2014that almost on a whim he collapsed a fragile balance of power, then had to cut and run.\n\nSo he blames those he betrayed as if they were servants who failed him, and tries to claim credit for himself for the good that they did. In a deranged meeting with Congressional leaders Wednesday, he reportedly declared, \u201cI captured ISIS.\u201d He claimed the \u201coverrated\u201d former Defense Secretary James Mattis told him it would take two years. \u201cI captured them in a month.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t do any capturing in fact. The Kurds did that.\n\nAnd Trump in another appearance decided to denigrate them.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds know how to fight and as I said they are not angels, they are not angels,\u201d Trump said during a photo-op with the Italian president. \u201cTake a look. You have to go back and take a look. And they fought with us, and we paid a lot of money for them to fight with us.\u201d\n\nWell, let\u2019s do that. Let\u2019s look at this force that Trump clearly views as nothing more than an army of mercenaries. Did they really \u201csave the sum of things,\u201d as the poet A.E. Housman once wrote, \u201cfor pay\u201d?\n\nIf so, then however many millions were spent, the United States got a lot more than its money\u2019s worth, because when the Islamic State surged across Syria and Iraq like a tidal wave of terror in 2014, all the other armies in the region, including those in which the U.S. had invested billions, were found to be complicit or corrupt and cowardly.\n\nASSAD'S GAME\n\nEarly in the Syrian conflict, Bashar al-Assad, the tyrant in Damascus, decided to cast his fight against democracy as a fight against Islamic terror\u2014and to that end released the many Islamic terrorists he had in his prisons. His regime knew them well, having facilitated their insurgency in neighboring Iraq against the United States and its allies.\n\nMahmud al-Naser, a defected Syrian intelligence officer interviewed for a series on Assad-ISIS collusion published by The Daily Beast in 2016, said the service he worked for estimated 20,000 people crossed into Iraq as the U.S. began its attack in March 2003. Most returned after the fall of Baghdad three weeks later. But another 5,000 crossed for reasons of religious ideology\u2014and they were \u201cwhat gave birth to the monster\u201d that became ISIS.\n\nIn the years that followed, Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies fought ferociously against other insurgents, but left ISIS virtually untouched as it built its \u201cCaliphate\u201d in eastern Syria and grew rich selling oil to the Assad regime among others.\n\nIRAQ\u2019S \u2018ASTRONAUTS\u2019\n\nIn June 2014, ISIS moved against Mosul, the second biggest metropolis in Iraq. The government\u2019s soldiers there had been trained by the U.S. and armed by the U.S. at enormous expense over the course of 11 years, and greatly outnumbered the ISIS forces. But the Iraqi military was rife with corruption. Many of the soldiers it had on its books were called \u201castronauts\u201d by the locals because they orbited very far from their units. In fact, their officers were pocketing the soldiers\u2019 salaries. And the problem grew worse as ISIS advanced deeper into Iraq, eventually threatening even Baghdad.\n\n\u201cThe astronaut phenomenon is destroying the Iraqi army,\u201d one officer, Kadhim al-Shammari, told the news site Niqash, a partner of The Daily Beast. \u201cThere are senior officers who are making deals with dozens of their men, giving them vacations for months in return for part or all of the men\u2019s salaries.\u201d\n\nAbbas al-Saadi, a soldier who should have been stationed near Tikrit where his unit was fighting ISIS, was working instead as a taxi driver in the capital.\n\n\u201cIf I was killed, who would look after my wife and three children?\u201d he asked. \u201cI love the military but I am worried about ISIS. They not only kill soldiers in battle, they behead them and burn them. That\u2019s why I decided to give all of my salary to the officer in charge of our unit so that he would register me absent with leave.\u201d\n\nRESCUING THE YAZIDIS\n\nThe Obama administration did not begin to recognize fully the kind of threat ISIS posed until after the fall of Mosul, and it did not begin to take serious action until August, when ISIS captured the town of Sinjar and began the systematic massacre of the Yazidi population, whose ancient religion was condemned as devil worship. Thousands of men were killed, women were raped and sold as slaves, children were taken to be indoctrinated in the ISIS version of Islam and turned into fighters.\n\nAs tens of thousands fled to the mountain above the town, the U.S. dropped food to the refugees and began to bomb ISIS positions. But someone needed to defend people on the ground, and the forces of Iraq\u2019s Kurdish Regional Government, the vaunted Peshmerga, had withdrawn.\n\nThe Kurds who stood their ground, as The Daily Beast reported at the time, were those from neighboring Syria, members of the so-called People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, a militia affiliated with the Turkish-Kurdish PKK, designated a terrorist organization not only by Ankara but also by Washington.\n\n\u201c In 2016 terrorism fueled a rise in xenophobic populism that helped propel fearmongering Donald Trump, with his call for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, into the White House. \u201d\n\nThe PKK, or Kurdistan People\u2019s Party, has fought a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish government, following a radical leftist ideology and employing terrorist as well as conventional guerrilla tactics. YPG fighters and supporters often brandish the image of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, now in a Turkish prison. But their bravery is legendary, and the YPG particularly is famous for its many women warriors, who were much in evidence fighting back against ISIS forces during the flight from Sinjar.\n\nWhen Yazidi refugees hit a checkpoint where peshmerga were confiscating unauthorized weapons they sent word back down their convoy: \u201cGive your guns to the YPG!\u201d\n\nThat same August, ISIS set out to horrify the United States, Europe, and anyone else who might challenge its power with a series of gruesome executions. Journalist James Foley and others were beheaded. Calls for the Obama administration to do something intensified, but there was no taste for a new deployment of American fighters on the ground in the Middle East. A competent local force had to be found.\n\nTHE TURNING POINT\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy for the United States to join forces with the YPG. There were no illusions about its close ties with the terrorist-designated PKK up to that point, and pulling together an alliance of local forces to fight ISIS was a little like the problem building an effective resistance to the Nazis in World War II. Many people back then were uncomfortable working with communists who revered Joseph Stalin, but the communists were among the most dedicated fighters.\n\nThen, in September 2014, ISIS laid siege to the town of Kobani on the Syrian-Turkish border.\n\nFor a year at least, Turkish authorities had watched as thousands of Islamic extremists from around the world flooded into Syria to fight Assad and, in many cases, to join ISIS. Now the Turkish military\u2014soldiers in NATO\u2019s second biggest army\u2014simply watched as the people of Kobani faced the ISIS onslaught. And once again, it was the Kurds of the YPG who went toe to toe against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201c The question is how long the YPG can defy the odds and prolong their last stand in a battle that resonates every bit as powerfully for Kurds as the Alamo once did for Americans. \u201d \u2014 From The Daily Beast writing about the Battle of Kobani, October 2014\n\n\u201cTurkish soldiers are meters away patrolling the fence, more to stop Turkish Kurds from joining the fight than to protect the country from Islamic militants besieging the Syrian border town,\u201d wrote The Daily Beast correspondent on the scene. \u201cIn the distance, black smoke is swirling from the western and northern sides of Kobani, the last redoubts of the few hundred YPG fighters who are there fighting for their lives. They control only about a third of the town now, YPG sources inside tell me, and the question remains how long they can defy the odds and prolong their last stand in a battle that resonates every bit as powerfully for Kurds as the Alamo once did for Americans.\u201d\n\nWeeks and then months passed as the U.S. began supplying quantities of weapons to the Kurds, and used air power to support them, until finally, in January 2015 the siege was broken\u2014and so was the myth that ISIS was unbeatable.\n\nAsked on Wednesday when the moment came that decided U.S. backing for the YPG, a senior State Department official in both the Obama and Trump administrations answered with one word: \u201cKobani.\u201d\n\nThe war to destroy the territorial claims of the so-called \u201cCaliphate\u201d went on with largely defensive battles to contain an Islamic State that claimed as its objective baqiya wa tatamadad, \u201cremaining and expanding.\u201d And as ISIS felt the pressure, its operatives and sympathizers launched stunning attacks in Europe and the United States. The Bataclan massacre in Paris in November 2015 and the Orlando night-club shooting in June 2016 are just two examples.\n\nENDGAME\n\nFear spread through Western electorates, fueling a rise in xenophobic populism that helped propel fearmongering Donald Trump, with his call for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, into the White House.\n\nBut the tough job, the fighting on the ground in the Syrian heart of ISIS-land, remained all along with the YPG and Arabs who joined with it to form the Syrian Democratic Forces. They retook Raqqa in October 2017 and delivered the final blow to the Caliphate as a physical territory when the town of Baghouz fell in March this year.\n\nISIS fighters, Trump declared at the time, \u201care losers and barely breathing.\u201d He claimed victory, as usual, for himself.\n\nThe YPG and SDF had lost thousands of men and women fighters, with many more left permanently handicapped. Are they angels? Perhaps killer angels. With the Americans and other members of the U.S. backed coalition raining death from the sky, they defeated on the ground the Islamic State\u2019s forces of darkness. Are they mercenaries? If so, then truly, they earned their keep when they saved the sum of things.\n\nAnd Trump? He\u2019s just pissed it all away.", "description": "He blames those he betrayed as if they were servants who failed him.", "authors": ["Christopher Dickey", "World News Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571308092/191016-dickey-kurds-tease_xk64e0", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
