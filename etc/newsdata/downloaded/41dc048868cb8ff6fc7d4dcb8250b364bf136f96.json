Fiji can still qualify for the knockouts mathematically, but they need several results to unexpectedly go their way. A win - maybe even a losing bonus point - would secure third place in the pool.\n\nWales are on a roll, too. They stormed out the blocks against a strong Australia side last week, and had no problems against the bellicose Georgians in the first week. Fiji have had a mixed bag. They were unlucky to come out on the losing side in their opening match against Australia, and were very impressive in their win over Georgia last week, but inconsistency is their Achilles Heel; the disappointing loss to Uruguay still hangs over their campaign like a cloud.\n\nThis morning's match does have a high level of intrigue attached to it. It is seen by many as a clash of styles: the Harlem Globetrotting Fijians, against the solidity and organisation of Warren Gatland's Wales.\n\nExpect Fiji, spearheaded by the oft-miraculous Josua Tuisova and Semi Radradra, to really chuck the ball about - they have absolutely nothing to lose and will be looking to entertain. How patient Wales can be in the face of any Fijian onslaught will be the most telling factor: will they be able to stick their guns, playing sensible, organised rugby; or will they be foolishly drawn into running the ball from everywhere as the match opens up?\n\nThere are no typhoon worries for this one, kick-off is around 90 minutes away, and we are set for a cracker.", "description": "A fascinating half of rugby.", "authors": ["Charles Richardson", "Brian Moore"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000212495902-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7CY4nO0dYSeuBHFAg_0GhMs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
