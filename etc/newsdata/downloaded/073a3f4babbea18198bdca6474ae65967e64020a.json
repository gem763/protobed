Perhaps that is because this government is well aware that many voters from ethnic minority groups realise the harm that Brexit will inflict on our communities.\n\nLet me be clear: there is no need for this legislation, which will cost up to \u00a320m per election.\n\nThe number of cases of attempted voter fraud in the UK is vanishingly small. The Electoral Commission states that between 2017 and 2018 there were two convictions and 10 cautions for this crime. In their own words, there is \u201cno evidence of large scale electoral fraud\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn terms of cost-effectiveness, this policy may well break some sort of record for how inefficient it would be. In the past it has been compared to using a sledgehammer to crack open a walnut, but the proportions of the proposed spend are closer to a bulldozer crushing a grain of wheat. But if the problem doesn\u2019t exist, what is this law supposed to achieve? In order to answer this question, we have to look at its effects and whom it will impact.\n\nPriti Patel is branding the Conservative Party as the party of \u201claw and order\u201d, and in that context a policy which seems to prevent a type of crime that theoretically threatens our democratic process makes a lot of political sense. Even if the problem doesn\u2019t exist, it looks good be addressing it preemptively, as least as far as Tory voters are concerned.\n\nBut, of course, it will have other effects, too \u2013 and this is where the evidence is more damning. During the local elections in May this year, a trial scheme for voter ID was carried. Of the 1,968 people who were turned away for not carrying identification to their polling station, 740 didn\u2019t come back. That\u2019s well over a third. This is shocking enough, but add in the fact that black and ethnic minority voters are less likely to possess the required ID in the first place, and it's clear this policy would affect that community disproportionately.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

the results of such a policy at a larger scale, turn to America. After strict voter ID laws were introduced in Wisconsin, the state's biggest city, Milwaukee, saw the lowest voter turnout in 20 years; Milwaukee is home to 70 per cent of the state's African American population. It is estimated that the laws impacted 300,000 Milwaukee voters. Donald Trump won that state by just 27,000 votes.\n\nMuch energy has already been spent examining what effect the policy might have on the results of a general election here in the UK, but what about the impact in the event of the Final Say referendum on Brexit?\n\nIn 2017, 77 per cent of ethnic minority votes went to the Labour party, which explicitly opposed a no-deal Brexit. When surveyed, 52 per cent of ethnic minority voters said they thought a no-deal Brexit would worsen race relations in Britain, and 53 per cent said leaving the EU without a deal would free people to make more negative comments about immigration in public.\n\nIs it a coincidence that one of the key demographics hardest by voter ID proposals aligns with a demographic that strongly opposes Brexit?\n\nThe evidence is clear. The UK Household Longitudinal Study suggests that 71 per cent of ethnic minorities supported Remain, and a poll conducted by Lord Ashcroft showed that only 27 per cent of black and 33 per cent of mixed race people who voted in the referendum voted for Brexit. Given that support among ethnic minorities for Brexit is very low, policies which introduce barriers to them exercising their democratic right would seem to be designed to artificially swing a referendum in favour of Leave, from a government which seems determined to deny these voters the Final Say anyway.\n\nThe government\u2019s Voter ID proposals cannot be allowed to pass into law \u2013 not just because it is an unnecessary waste of money (and it is), but because it will affect some citizens more than others and that is simply undemocratic. Ethnic minorities will not continue to be politically ignored, especially when it comes to a Final Say \u2013 which this policy might hint is on the threshold of being delivered.", "description": "The proposals to introduce a requirement for voters to bring ID to polling stations is nothing less than a suppression of\u00a0ethnic minority voters.
