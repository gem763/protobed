Among those tested, 48% had blood alcohol levels beyond the .08 legal limit for operating a motor vehicle, its authors wrote.\n\nSixty percent of the 103 patients were also screened for drugs, of which 52% tested positive, the study said. Marijuana, methamphetamine and amphetamine were the most common substances found during tests of those patients, the study said.\n\nHelmet information was only available for 98 of the 103 patients, the researchers noted. Of the 98 patients studied, only two were wearing a helmet, according to the report.\n\n\u201cInterventions aimed at increasing helmet use and discouraging eScooter operation while intoxicated are necessary to reduce the burden of eScooter-related trauma,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\n\u201cE-scooters may look like fun and games, but it\u2019s a vehicle. It\u2019s a motor attached to wheels, and you need to have a healthy respect for it. Anyone drinking or using any mind-altering substance should not be operating an e-scooter,\u201d added the study\u2019s lead author, HealthDay News reported.\n\nCompanies including Bird and Lime launched mobile phone apps in late 2017 that allow users to rent standing electric motorized scooters for mere cents per minute. Started in southern California, each of the companies has expanded operations in the last two years to more than 100 cities in the U.S. and abroad, facilitating a combined 36 million rides and counting, the study noted.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our riders and of those in the communities in which Bird is available is of paramount importance to us,\u201d a Bird spokesperson said in an email to The Washington Times. \u201cThe rules of the road, apply to everyone \u2014 whether behind the wheel, walking, cycling or on a scooter. We go to great lengths to educate and inform riders about the dangers of distracted riding, including riding under the influence, as well as educating them on how to identify drivers who might be operating cars under the influence.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafety is our top priority at Lime. That\u2019s why every day we\u2019re innovating on technology, infrastructure and education to set the standard for micromobility safety,\u201d Lime said in a statement. \u201cWe appreciate the attention on this very important issue, and we look forward to working with the industry, medical community and regulators to create a healthy ecosystem for this new and evolving technology.\u201d\n\nThe results of a separate study conducted in partnership with the U.S. Centers for Disease and Prevention previously found that e-scooter riders have reported injuries at a rate of 14.3 per 100,000 trips, adding that a high proportion of the injuries involved \u201cpotentially preventable risk factors,\u201d including specifically not wearing a helmet in many cases.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
