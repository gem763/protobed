REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\n\u201cThe more America achieves, the more hateful and enraged these crazy Democrats become. They\u2019re crazy. They\u2019re crazy,\u201d Trump said at a packed American Airlines Center in downtown Dallas.\n\nPelosi accused Trump of having a \u201cmeltdown\u201d after walking out of a White House meeting on Wednesday where she and other Democratic leaders complained about his decision to pull U.S. troops from northeastern Syria and allow Turkey to attack America\u2019s Kurdish allies in the area.\n\n\u201cCrazy Nancy. That Crazy Nancy, she is crazy,\u201d Trump said of Pelosi.\n\nTrump has faced a backlash from his own Republican allies in Congress for the Syria pullout, but the president on Thursday said a ceasefire negotiated by Vice President Mike Pence with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had helped ease the crisis.\n\nPelosi opened an impeachment inquiry in the House on revelations that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate unsubstantiated allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential contender, and his son Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nTrump dismissed the impeachment inquiry as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and said Democrats are trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election that he won.\n\n\u201cAt stake in this fight is the survival of American democracy itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they want. But we will never let it happen.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s appearance in Dallas was aimed at rallying his core base of voter support in a state that he is favored to win in the November 2020 presidential election.\n\nTexas has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976 but an increase in Democratic voters in big cities like Austin and Houston could make it a closer race in 2020 than it has been in the past.\n\nTrump would not be expected to be re-elected should he lose the state\u2019s 38 electoral votes.\n\nTrump was concluding a long day in Texas in which he raised $5.5 million for his re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee at two events.\n\nHe also cut the ribbon on a Louis Vuitton factory in Alvarado, Texas, where workers will produce the high-end fashion products made famous by the French company.\n\nThe company\u2019s billionaire controlling shareholder, Bernard Arnault, joined Trump for the event at the 100,000-square-foot (9,290-square-meter) plant.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cLouis Vuitton, a name I know well - cost me a lot of money over the years,\u201d said Trump.\n\nFormer U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Democratic presidential candidate from Texas who is lagging in the polls, staged a competing event in Grand Prairie, Texas, featuring performances by Lil\u2019 Keke, Cure for Paranoia and NuFolk Rebel Alliance.\n\n\u201cThis president has trafficked in hate and racism. He has tried to make people afraid of our differences. But tonight, Texans are going to come together and we are going to stand up to all of that,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in a tweet.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday lashed out at a campaign rally at Democratic opponents like \"crazy Nancy\" Pelosi, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, for pushing an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442103065&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H03S", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
