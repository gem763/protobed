The panel is one of several high-profile committees \u2014 including the Intelligence, Oversight and Judiciary panels \u2014 spearheading the impeachment probe into Mr. Trump's efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to conduct politically motivated investigations, including one into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nAlong with the other panels, Engel's committee has demanded documents from Pompeo about the administration's recent dealings with the Ukrainian government, as well as testimony from current and former top State Department officials who led diplomatic engagements with the former Soviet country.\n\nA committee official said Saturday that the State Department had \"failed to meet the deadline to produce documents required by the subpoena.\" But the official said the department \"has contacted the Committees on this matter and we hope the Department will cooperate in full promptly.\"\n\nThe whistleblower complaint at the center of the impeachment push \u2014 as well other revelations, including congressional testimony from the former top U.S. envoy to Ukraine \u2014 have shown the State Department was aware of Mr. Trump's requests to have Ukraine dig up dirt on political rivals. High-ranking officials communicated these requests to the Ukrainian government and facilitated meetings between top Ukrainian officials and Mr. Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who was overseeing what amounted to a shadow diplomatic campaign on behalf of the president.\n\nAlthough he said over the weekend that his agency had responded to the request for documents, Pompeo has sharply rebuked the Democratic-led panels, accusing them of harassing State Department employees and failing to go through official channels to seek testimony and documents.\n\nBut Engel on Sunday said there was some irony in Pompeo accusing lawmakers and their staff of harassing State Department employees.\n\n\"We have been getting numerous complaints from people who work at the State Department about all kinds of harassment by this administration, where people were summarily let go or fired because they were deemed to be the wrong political persuasion or the wrong ethnic persuasion,\" he said.\n\nIn August, the State Department's inspector general released a report denouncing the political targeting of career State Department employees during the Trump administration, detailing \"inappropriate accusations of disloyalty\" and \"harassment of employees based on perceived political views.\"\n\n\"I find it really laughable that the secretary of state suddenly has this great concern for the State Department,\" Engel said.\n\nOlivia Gazis contributed reporting.", "description": "The House Committee on Foreign Affairs has demanded documents from the secretary of state about the administration's dealings with Ukraine", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/06/0dd21c52-e33f-4c7c-8aec-cfca3b3d5c63/thumbnail/1200x630/04d5fdf42a9d5bcea3e7d471b99d8cb9/engel1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
