'Bluey' on Disney is a show kids can watch on repeat without driving parents crazy", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\n\"Bluey\" follows a family of blue heeler dogs with Australian accents and it's the best kids show I've seen in a long time. (Photo: Ludo Studios Pty Ltd 2018)\n\nI\u2019ve been gently trying to steer my preschooler away from \u201cSofia the First\u201d and \u201cPJ Masks\u201d for a while now.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the shows are bad\u2014though \u201cPJ Masks\u201d adherence to plot formula basically means if you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen them all. It\u2019s that I\u2019ve seen them so many times, I just can\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nSo, a few weeks ago when my daughter clicked on an image of a happy blue dog to launch \u201cBluey\u201d within the DisneyNow app, I mentally crossed my fingers and hoped we\u2019d found something good.\n\nFrom the cute theme song to the feel-good ending, it was delightful. Charming. Genuinely funny. Modern and authentic.\n\nWe\u2019ve since watched all the episodes Disney Junior has of the Ludo Studios/Australian Broadcasting Corporation/BBC Studios show. And, they\u2019re all good, as I\u2019ve raved to my friends with young kids who were looking for relief from shows like \u201cBubble Guppies\u201d and \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d (again, not bad, just no more). And my karma must be doing OK because Disney is launching new episodes starting Oct. 21.\n\nIf you\u2019re skeptical about a foursome of blue heelers with Australian accents can reflect a modern American family, let me explain.\n\n'Bluey' is just. so. good.\n\nI\u2019ll start with \u201cMarkets,\u201d the first episode my daughter and I watched.\n\nBluey, a 6-year-old puppy, proudly tells her dad, Bandit, the tooth fairy gave her $5. Dad spits out his cereal and asks, \u201cFive bucks?!\u201d He looks at mom, Chilli, who assures him that\u2019s the amount the fairy left all Bluey\u2019s friends.\n\n\u201cWell, that tooth fairy is doing well for herself, isn\u2019t she?\u201d he asks, winking at mom and Bluey, who\u2019s in the background doing the flossing dance with excitement.\n\nThe dog family, which includes Bluey\u2019s little sister Bingo, goes to the market.\n\nBluey and her friend go from booth to booth, trying to decide what to spend her $5 on. They find a \u201cpony lady\u201d who\u2019s charging $5 to ride miniature ponies. Bluey hands over her money, then learns she only has enough for one rider and it would cost $10 for both girls to ride.\n\n\u201cI only want to go if Indy can come,\u201d she says, deciding to get her money back and continue looking for a treat.\n\nBluey and her friend Indy learn about how money works during an episode of \"Bluey.\" (Photo: Ludo Studios Pty Ltd 2018)\n\nNext up, is the German sausage booth. But Indy tells Bluey her mom won\u2019t let her eat sausage because it has \u201cadditives,\u201d stumbling over the pronunciation. At a dessert booth, Indy asks the vendor if the doughnuts have \u201cwheat, sugar, gluten or dairy?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all they\u2019ve got in them,\u201d he responds.\n\nFeeling her money burning a hole in her pocket, Bluey caves to pressure and buys a toffee apple after the vendor says there\u2019s only one left. She immediately regrets her decision, especially since her friend can\u2019t share the treat. Bluey asks her dad to have her $5 back.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not really how it works, kiddo,\u201d he explains. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve spent money, it\u2019s, well, gone.\u201d\n\nBluey is bummed, so her friend comforts her: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Bluey. My mom always says to me, \u2018What goes around, comes around.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Bluey asks.\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Indy says.\n\nCue music and a montage plays to illustrate Bluey\u2019s $5, which the tooth fairy marked with a sticker, move from the toffee apple vendor to the German sausage booth and eventually to Indy\u2019s mom\u2019s sugar-, dairy-, gluten-free dessert booth. Bluey and Indy are shocked to see the money come full circle.\n\nSo there\u2014in a short, seven-minute episode\u2014my daughter and I both laughed and learned about friendship, special diets, personal finance and the economy. From a family of dogs.\n\nBluey's family is brilliant\n\nThe other thing I love about \u201cBluey\u201d is the family dynamic.\n\nDad parents. He\u2019s sarcastic, sympathetic and silly (watch the \u201cTakeaway\u201d episode). Mom works. She\u2019s fun and the voice of reason. She saves an otherwise disastrous day during \u201cThe Pool.\u201d Bingo and Bluey love each other but have to navigate sisterhood by learning how to include each other (watch \u201cButterflies\u201d) and compromise (watch \u201cGrannies\u201d).\n\nSprinkle in endearing details like the way the kids giggle and the nonsense questions they ask, I don\u2019t hesitate to say yes when my daughter asks, \u201cCan I watch another one, mom?\u201d because I want more, too.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/21/bluey-disney-must-watch-kids-show-parents-love/4022776002/", "description": "You'll be fine watching \"Bluey\" on repeat.
