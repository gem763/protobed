But so far, the vast majority of media altered to mislead has been extremely simple.\n\nThe easiest way to confuse is just to take a photo or video out of context, mislabeling or mischaracterizing it. A common example: archived clips of missile strikes in Iraq repurposed to look like a new American or Russian attack in Syria.\n\nBad Photoshops fall into this category, too. It doesn't take much to put a political leader in a seemingly compromising situation with an altered photo.\n\nHere, a simple slowdown \u2014 while preserving the speaker's pitch \u2014 is paired with an explicit claim that Pelosi is intoxicated. One example video description from YouTube, paired with a copy of the video uploaded by a user with a Trump campaign sign avatar:\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi drunk giving an interview babbling about President Trump being involved in a \"cover up\" They didn't embarrass themselves enough on the \"Russian Collusion\" thing. Share this disgrace...\n\nPresident Trump tweeted a different video of Pelosi on Thursday evening, this one edited to highlight moments in a recent speech where she stumbled or stuttered. It did not appear to have been otherwise manipulated.\n\nAround the same time, Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, appeared to have tweeted out the slowed-down video before deleting the tweet.\n\nWhat they're saying: Social media platforms must balance the potential dangers of misinformation with free speech concerns when deciding what to do with videos like this one.", "description": "The clip appears to have been slowed to make the Speaker sound drunk.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/y6_1DGJeEK9flyI2AAyBPzCgCWY=/0x136:3859x2307/1920x1080/2019/05/23/1558641963218.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-23"}
