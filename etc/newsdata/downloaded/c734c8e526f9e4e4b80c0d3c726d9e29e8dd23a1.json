USA TODAY\n\nRemember the days of yesteryear when we could count on defensive slobberknockers in the SEC and shootouts in the Big 12 and \u2014 suddenly, we\u2019re living in a bizarro world where Oklahoma has a defense and LSU does not.\n\nBut LSU\u2019s fabulous offense is why the Tigers are moving up in the Football Four bracket. Oklahoma\u2019s surprisingly stout defense is why the Sooners are firmly wedged into the field, as well. Who\u2019d ever have thought either of those would happen? But isn\u2019t it fun?\n\nMeanwhile, as we officially cross the midpoint of the college football season, Clemson seems to still be good. Alabama, too. Ohio State, which didn\u2019t play this week, remains the most impressive team this committee has seen. It\u2019s time to talk about Wisconsin, which has shut out four of its six opponents, and maybe Penn State, too. And oh, hey Georgia, what was that?\n\nWeek 7 winners and losers: Georgia and Oklahoma lead the way\n\nWeek 7 observations: LSU finally has the offense to compete with Alabama\n\nLSU Tigers quarterback Joe Burrow and head coach Ed Orgeron celebrate during the fourth quarter against the Florida Gators. (Photo: Derick E. Hingle, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAs always, remember we pick the bracket as if the season ended today.*\n\nFootball Four\n\n1. Ohio State \u2013 The Buckeyes took the weekend off. Halfway through the season, Ohio State looks formidable in every facet.\n\n2. LSU \u2013 After winning a shootout against Florida, the Tigers move up a couple of seeds in the bracket. Is Joe Burrow your Heisman front-runner? Is LSU the SEC West\u2019s best?\n\n3. Oklahoma \u2013 Does Oklahoma have a defense? Surprisingly, yes. And yeah, it matters. It\u2019s just possible the Sooners are closer to a complete package than in recent years.\n\n4. Alabama \u2013 Does Alabama\u2019s defense have some issues? Yes. Does it matter? Have you seen Tua Tagovailoa and all of his wonderful toys? It might not matter.\n\nFour More**\n\n5. Clemson \u2013 Remember all that concern about the Tigers after the scare at North Carolina? Yeah, never mind. Clemson\u2019s fine.\n\n6. Wisconsin \u2013This defense is scary good. That Oct. 26 date at Ohio State cannot get here soon enough.\n\n7. Penn State \u2013 It wasn\u2019t easy at Iowa City, but maybe it\u2019s just that Iowa City does strange things to teams. Penn State is a Big Ten East factor.\n\n8. Notre Dame \u2013 The Irish probably have a ceiling below the bracket, but they notched a win against USC.\n\nA Few More After That***\n\nOregon \u2013 The Ducks might forever ponder losing that 15-point lead in the opener against Auburn. The Ducks are packing a mean defense.\n\nGeorgia \u2013 The Bulldogs got beat at home by a mediocre South Carolina bunch playing with a third-string quarterback. It\u2019s juuuuust possible the Dawgs were a tad overrated. But they\u2019re still very much alive \u2013 if they win out.\n\nFlorida \u2013 The Gators didn\u2019t quite have enough to win a shootout in Baton Rouge, but that previously pedestrian offense looked pretty good against the Tigers.\n\nAuburn \u2013 Took the weekend off, and next weekend they\u2019re at Arkansas (so it\u2019s almost the same) before hitting the road to Baton Rouge and LSU.\n\nFutile Four****\n\nMichigan State \u2013 After getting blanked by Wisconsin, the Spartans have not scored a touchdown in three of their last four games. And Mark Dantonio is not having your impertinent questions about any staff decisions he didn\u2019t make last offseason.\n\nMemphis \u2013 It\u2019s only one loss, on the road, in conference play. But when the goal is getting that Group of Five bid to a New Year\u2019s Six bowl, the likely prerequisite is going unbeaten.\n\nUSC \u2013 The Trojans played decently in South Bend but couldn\u2019t quite get the upset of Notre Dame. At 3-3, the fate of Clay Helton seems pretty settled (except there\u2019s no athletic director yet to make a move).\n\nMississippi State \u2013 It\u2019s been a difficult season on the injury front at quarterback, but the Bulldogs didn\u2019t get good play from either in a loss at Tennessee. Helping a conference rival get out of the Futile Four is a good way to get into it.\n\n* The season is not over today.\n\n** Don\u2019t be worried that your team sits just outside the cut. This is a weekly snapshot. And what do we know, anyway?\n\n*** See the previous note, but it\u2019s OK to be slightly concerned or very angry. But what do we know, anyway?\n\n**** No note necessary.", "description": "LSU's standing as a legitimate College Football Playoff contender was bolstered Saturday night with the Tigers' big win over Florida.", "authors": ["George Schroeder", "Published A.M.
