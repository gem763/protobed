Alex Ellinghausen\n\nUnder fire for hiring Christopher Pyne within weeks of his leaving office, EY insisted he'd barely be doing anything at all.\n\nHe'd simply provide \"occasional high-level strategic advice\", an EY spokeswoman said. Defence industry leader Mark Stewart later told parliament this would involve the former defence minister working for EY \"two days a month\". Which hardly sounds like anything worth getting upset about.\n\nAttendees at the Pacific International Maritime Exposition got a first-hand glance at what exactly such minimal work entails. Pyne was there, with an EY delegation that included Stewart, getting plenty of face time with the decision-makers of Australia's defence procurement industry. Which, for EY, must have been handy.\n\nAnd it gave attendees a chance to catch up with all things Pyne, who five months after leaving parliament seems to have a lot on his plate. Between his lobbying and his new podcast (the first episode drops on Monday), we hear he has a book to write for publishing doyen Louise Adler, formerly of Melbourne University Press. Seems she's still giving politicians all the rope they need at her new employer Hachette.", "description": "Under fire for hiring Christopher Pyne within weeks of his leaving office, EY insisted\u00a0he'd barely be doing anything at all.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6132%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1040%2C$y_97/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5460ddded1360d5fed4d95f0c8db3990afb22095", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
