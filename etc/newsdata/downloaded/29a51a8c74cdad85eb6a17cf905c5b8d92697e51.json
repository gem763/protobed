(NYSE:ITT) Will Be Trading Ex-Dividend", "language": "en", "text": "Readers hoping to buy ITT Inc. (NYSE:ITT) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. You will need to purchase shares before the 9th of September to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of October.\n\nITT's upcoming dividend is US$0.15 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.59 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, ITT has a trailing yield of approximately 1.1% on its current stock price of $55.19. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether ITT's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for ITT\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. ITT paid out just 16% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 24% of its cash flow last year.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nNYSE:ITT Historical Dividend Yield, September 4th 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nCompanies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see ITT's earnings per share have dropped 8.6% a year over the past five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls.\n\nThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. ITT has seen its dividend decline 8.3% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see. While it's not great that earnings and dividends per share have fallen in recent years, we're encouraged by the fact that management has trimmed the dividend rather than risk over-committing the company in a risky attempt to maintain yields to shareholders.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIs ITT an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share are down meaningfully, although at least the company is paying out a low and conservative percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's definitely not great to see earnings falling, but at least there may be some buffer before the dividend needs to be cut. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy ITT today.\n\nEver wonder what the future holds for ITT?
