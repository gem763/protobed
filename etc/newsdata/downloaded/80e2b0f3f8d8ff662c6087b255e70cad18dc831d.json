Both the British and Australian governments have been trying to keep the identities of their arrested citizens from the public domain, believing diplomatic efforts to have them released would be more effective if conducted in private.\n\nThe University of Melbourne\u2019s website lists Dr Moore-Gilbert on its \u201cFind an expert\u201d page as a lecturer at the university\u2019s Asia Institute.\n\nIt says she \u201cspecialises in Middle Eastern politics, with a particular focus on the Arab Gulf states,\u201d and that she had published work on the 2011 Arab uprisings, authoritarian governance, and on the role of new media technologies in political activism.\n\nHer most recent publications have been journal articles and book chapters regarding Bahrain\u2019s \u2018February 14\u2019 pro-democracy youth movement.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Saturday released a statement from Dr Moore-Gilbert\u2019s family, which said: \u201cWe have been and continue to be in close contact with the Australian government.\n\n\u201cOur family thanks the government and the University of Melbourne for their ongoing support at this distressing and sensitive time. We believe that the best chance of securing Kylie\u2019s safe return is through diplomatic channels.\n\n\u201cWe will not be making any further comment and would like to request that our privacy \u2013 and that of our wider family and friends \u2013 is respected at this time.\u201d\n\nWhile news of the trio\u2019s incarcerations only surfaced this week, Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, says she has raised their cases \u201cmany times\u201d with her Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif.\n\nSenator Payne has denied the arrests were politically motivated, although some reports have speculated the trio are being held in hope of giving Iran political leverage on a number of ongoing disputes with the western countries.\n\n\u201cWe have no reason to think that these arrests are connected to international concern over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, United Nations sanction enforcement or maritime security concerning the safety of civilian shipping,\u201d Senator Payne said.\n\nNews of the three prisoners this week has come amid a downturn in relations between Iran and the US-led western bloc, including the UK and Australia. Relations with Tehran and have been seriously strained over the re-imposition of economic sanctions after US president Donald Trump unilaterally tore up the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the \u2018Iran nuclear deal\u2019 to limit Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nBritish and Iranian relations have been further inflamed by tensions in the Persian Gulf, including the Royal Marines\u2019 seizure near Gibraltar in July of an Iranian oil tanker, the Adrian Darya 1, formerly known as Grace 1.\n\nIran responded by seizing British-flagged oil tanker the Stena Impero in what was another chapter in a campaign of interfering with shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nWhile Britain released the Adrian Darya 1, the Stena Impero is still being held by Iran.\n\nRelations between Iran and Australia, however, have historically been robust. Australia has maintained diplomatic relations with Tehran through recent decades where other western nations have abandoned them, or they have become acutely strained.\n\nBut in August, the Australian prime minister committed to a US-led mission to patrol the Strait of Hormuz, off Iran\u2019s south coast, through which about a fifth of the world\u2019s oil passes. Scott Morrison said \u201cdestabilising behaviour\u201d \u2013 a thinly veiled reference to Iran\u2019s capture of foreign-flagged ships \u2013 was a threat to Australian interests.\n\nKing, a building designer, and Firkin, a construction manager, left their home in Perth, Western Australia, in 2017, documenting their travels on a blog called The Way Overland. They planned to drive from Perth to London.\n\nThe editor of the Persian-language broadcaster Manoto TV, Pouria Zeraati, said on Twitter a source had told him the couple had been arrested \u201cfor flying a drone near the capital, Tehran\u201d.\n\nEarlier reports suggested the couple had been camping in a military area around Jajrood in Tehran province.\n\nThe couple were blogging their travels on YouTube and Instagram. Dozens of videos and photographs posted online appear to have been shot using a drone.\n\n\u201cThe family says this was a misunderstanding and Jolie King and her fiance Mark Firkin were unaware of the Iranian law which bans drone flights without a licence,\u201d Zeraati said online.\n\n\u201cTheir trial has not been held yet and it is not clear what the Islamic Republic [of Iran] wants out of this arrest, as no one from the judiciary or intelligence services has made any comment on this.\u201d\n\nEvin prison, the main detention centre for Iran\u2019s political prisoners, also houses 41-year-old Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian mother of one who is midway through a five year sentence on spying charges which began in 2016.\n\nWhile Iran has not commented publicly on any of the arrests, in April Zarif proposed swapping Zaghari-Ratcliffe for Negar Ghodskani, an Iranian woman in jail in the US.\n\nPress Association contributed to this report.", "description": "Cambridge-educated lecturer in Islamic Studies at Melbourne University has been in prison in Tehran for almost a year", "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/803a92f2343d30b50384cc1aa2abd04aa839c294/0_84_1192_715/master/1192.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ae0ab71e9421ebbbfe36362d6380d081", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
