(NASDAQ:TRNS) Insiders Sell Shares?", "language": "en", "text": "We often see insiders buying up shares in companies that perform well over the long term. Unfortunately, there are also plenty of examples of share prices declining precipitously after insiders have sold shares. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Transcat, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRNS).\n\nWhat Is Insider Buying?\n\nIt's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, rules govern insider transactions, and certain disclosures are required.\n\nWe don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions. But logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. As Peter Lynch said, 'insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.'\n\nSee our latest analysis for Transcat\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Transcat\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman of the Board, Charles Hadeed, for US$265k worth of shares, at about US$26.50 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$22.37. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).\n\nHappily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$109k for 5350 shares. On the other hand they divested 35378 shares, for US$883k. All up, insiders sold more shares in Transcat than they bought, over the last year.

In total, insiders dumped US$278k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\n\nDoes Transcat Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that Transcat insiders own 7.2% of the company, worth about US$12m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Transcat Tell Us?\n\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. On the plus side, Transcat makes money, and is growing profits. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. So we'd only buy after careful consideration.
