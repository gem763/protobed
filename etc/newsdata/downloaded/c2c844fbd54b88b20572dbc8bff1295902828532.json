The first episode of the season will veer away from the usual craziness such as Chad Michael Murray led cults, serial killers, relationship drama, Serpent disputes, and even bear attacks to pay tribute to beloved actor Luke Perry who portrayed Fred Andrews, the father of Archie Andrews.\n\nRoberto Aguirre-Sacasa shares with TVLine about how last season they deliberately chose not to address Perry\u2019s passing for they wanted to take time to address it properly and not place it between the crazy stories that were happening at the end of season three.\n\nFans will note that last season had several crazy schemes that were wrapped up by the end of the season, with each of the four characters having spent much of the season separated on their own stories.\n\nThe EP continues that the hiatus gave them time to reflect and think about the story they wanted to tell, which he notes were the right decision and informs that they wanted to tell a very grounded truthful story in the premiere. Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa goes on to say that the episode was brutal to film especially for KJ Apa who plays Archie and was Perry's primary scene partner, sharing that everyone was proud to tell this tribute and that it gave everyone a chance to process of the loss of Perry together.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!
