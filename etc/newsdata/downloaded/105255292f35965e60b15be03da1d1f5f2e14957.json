At one elite northeastern elementary school, for example, a teacher posted a \u201cproblem of the day,\u201d which students had to solve before going home, even though no time was set aside for working on it. The point of the exercise was to train fifth graders to snatch a few extra minutes of work time by multitasking or by sacrificing recess.\n\nSuch demands exact a toll. Elite middle and high schools now commonly require three to five hours of homework a night; epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned of schoolwork-induced sleep deprivation. Wealthy students show higher rates of drug and alcohol abuse than poor students do. They also suffer depression and anxiety at rates as much as triple those of their age peers throughout the country. A recent study of a Silicon Valley high school found that 54 percent of students displayed moderate to severe symptoms of depression and 80 percent displayed moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety.\n\nThese students nevertheless have good reason to push themselves as they do. Elite universities that just a few decades ago accepted 30 percent of their applicants now accept less than 10 percent. The shift at certain institutions has been even more dramatic: The University of Chicago admitted 71 percent of its applicants as recently as 1995. In 2019 it admitted less than 6 percent.\n\nThe contest intensifies when meritocrats enter the workplace, where elite opportunity is exceeded only by the competitive effort required to grasp it. A person whose wealth and status depend on her human capital simply cannot afford to consult her own interests or passions in choosing her job. Instead, she must approach work as an opportunity to extract value from her human capital, especially if she wants an income sufficient to buy her children the type of schooling that secured her own eliteness. She must devote herself to a narrowly restricted class of high-paying jobs, concentrated in finance, management, law, and medicine. Whereas aristocrats once considered themselves a leisure class, meritocrats work with unprecedented intensity.\n\nEdmon de Haro\n\nIn 1962, when many elite lawyers earned roughly a third of what they do today, the American Bar Association could confidently declare, \u201cThere are \u2026 approximately 1,300 fee-earning hours per year\u201d available to the normal lawyer. In 2000, by contrast, a major law firm pronounced with equal confidence that a quota of 2,400 billable hours, \u201cif properly managed,\u201d was \u201cnot unreasonable,\u201d which is a euphemism for \u201cnecessary for having a hope of making partner.\u201d Because not all the hours a lawyer works are billable, billing 2,400 hours could easily require working from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. six days a week, every week of the year, without vacation or sick days. In finance, \u201cbankers\u2019 hours\u201d\u2014originally named for the 10-to-3 business day fixed by banks from the 19th century through the mid-20th century and later used to refer more generally to any light work\u2014have given way to the ironically named \u201cbanker 9-to-5,\u201d which begins at 9 a.m. on one day and runs through 5 a.m. on the next. Elite managers were once \u201corganization men,\u201d cocooned by lifelong employment in a corporate hierarchy that rewarded seniority above performance. Today, the higher a person climbs on the org chart, the harder she is expected to work. Amazon\u2019s \u201cleadership principles\u201d call for managers to have \u201crelentlessly high standards\u201d and to \u201cdeliver results.\u201d The company tells managers that when they \u201chit the wall\u201d at work, the only solution is to \u201cclimb the wall.\u201d", "description": "Meritocracy prizes achievement above all else, making everyone\u2014even the rich\u2014miserable.
