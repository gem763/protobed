However, it is still facing the prospect of the U.S. imposing a new 15 per cent tariff on about $160 billion worth of its goods on December 15.\n\nChen said the partial deal could pave the way for agreement on some of the trickier issues.\n\n\u201cThe two sides might have warmed up for the more difficult issues scheduled for the phase-two negotiations,\u201d she said.\n\nPhase two is expected to cover a number of thorny issues, including intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers, and an enforcement mechanism.\n\nWang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China, said Beijing was more wary of Washington\u2019s demands for institutional reforms.\n\n\u201cChina is always willing to negotiate on technical issues such as trade, but it remains on high alert to some U.S. attempts to package strategic gaming into the negotiations and won\u2019t make concessions,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut China is willing to make more reforms. The U.S.\u2019s demands, such as on market opening and intellectual property protection, can be met.\u201d\n\nComparing the ongoing talks to China\u2019s 15-year effort to join the World Trade Organization, Chen said Beijing may decide to introduce more institutional changes after the Communist Party\u2019s Fourth Plenum, a four-day event that gets under way on Monday, though any such moves would be gradual.\n\nAfter the central government formulated the policies, they would then be allowed to become \u201cwidely accepted before being implemented,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump, who is facing the threat of impeachment at home, has not commented on China on Twitter since the latest round of trade talks in Washington almost two weeks ago.\n\nDespite the progress towards a trade deal, concerns remain as to whether consensus can be reached after Vice-President Mike Pence linked Xinjiang and Hong Kong to the trade war during a speech on Thursday that sparked criticism from China\u2019s foreign ministry, which described it as \u201cpolitical bias and lies.\u201d\n\n\u201c[But] China must understand that Trump is trying to paint himself as a winner in the run-up to the [2020] presidential election, so it doesn\u2019t need to overreact,\u201d Chen said.\n\nChina\u2019s state media have made repeated calls for the U.S. to create a good atmosphere for the negotiations.\n\n\u201cThe goal of cooperation and win-win can only be achieved on the condition of equality, mutual respect and appropriately addressing the core concerns of both parties,\u201d the Communist mouthpiece People\u2019s Daily said in an editorial on Saturday.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e1/a9/a0715d2249708839a8559d412e20/191026-mnuchin-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
