Some of the people coming in for interviews, their expectation of what they should be paid versus how much they\u2019re expected to work is just crazy,\u201d he said.\n\nJohn, who took over the company from his dad after his grandfather created it over a century ago, seems to consider himself an expert on hard work, despite being incredibly privileged. It appears Mr Winning doesn\u2019t quite realise that life is a lot easier when your family owns a multi-million dollar company.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the 35-year-old hasn\u2019t worked hard, but as someone who comes from a reasonably privileged upbringing, I\u2019m well aware that many of the opportunities I\u2019ve been given are largely due to the privilege I have.\n\nJohn has achieved a number of great things in his 35 years of life, including starting discount white goods website Appliances Online. He hasn\u2019t just taken his family\u2019s business and kept it going, he\u2019s worked hard to better it. But that doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that he\u2019s blatantly ignoring (or blissfully unaware of) his privilege. To put it in his own words, he \u201cknew nothing about technology, management or even retail\u201d before taking on the leadership role.\n\n\u201cI am now an unconventional leader because I don\u2019t know what normal management is. I was thrown in the deep end because the business just grew. I went from being a kid that had done truck deliveries and a few sales on the shop floor, into suddenly running an e-commerce website when I knew nothing about technology, management or even retail, other than the fact that it\u2019s in my blood,\u201d John said in an interview with CEO Magazine.\n\nDespite being a millennial himself, Winning says good millennial workers are \u201cfew and far between.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou train them up and by the time they\u2019ve finished the two-month training, they\u2019re either looking for the next thing or asking for a promotion or more money,\u201d he said to SMH. Honestly, it sounds like they\u2019re hustling to me.\n\nThroughout the interview, he also blamed Instagram for our supposed entitlement issues. Of course it\u2019s Instagram that\u2019s the problem.\n\n\u201cPeople expect they should be able to spend all this money on eating out because they see all their friends on social media eating out breakfast, lunch and dinner, having these great lives and going to Europe every Australian winter.\u201d\n\nAccording to SMH, John considers \u201chustling\u201d to be \u201crolling your sleeves up and working from early in the morning to late at night.\u201d However, he neglected to comment on the fact that he was basically a shoe-in for CEO of the 113-year-old company from the day he was born.\n\nThere has been a definite shift in priorities when it comes to careers for millennials and Gen Z, with many of us wanting to feel happy and creatively fulfilled, rather than slaving away to a job we hate all for the sake of a fat pay-cheque. But I don\u2019t think this makes us lazy at all.\n\nAccording to Millennial Career, more than half of millennials would prefer to make $30,000 at a job they love, than work a job they hate for $100,000. But although there has been a shift in values, that doesn\u2019t mean that the younger generation are lazy or entitled.\n\nAccording to Entrepreneur.com, about 41% of Gen Z plan to take on some sort of entrepreneurial venture. Similarly, Forbes reports that over 62% of millennials have considered it.\n\nBut it appears John Winning is too caught up in the building with his name on the wall to realise the privilege he has. Many factors including wealth, education and social status can greatly impact how likely you are to be successful.\n\nIt\u2019s not impossible to be successful or \u201cself-made\u201d if you weren\u2019t brought up with a CEO father, but it\u2019ll definitely take a lot more work. And even if you work your ass off for years, sometimes you\u2019re just not given the same opportunity as someone who\u2019s taking over their grandfather\u2019s company when their dad retires.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky enough to be a privileged person, you\u2019re allowed to take advantage of the opportunities you\u2019re given, but it\u2019s not fair to pretend everybody else is lazy because they weren\u2019t so lucky.", "description": "Millennial CEO John Winning claims that other millennials are lazy and entitled, despite coming from a place of immense privilege.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/johnwinning.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
