Whilst the US government has steadfastly declined to give that waiver, that is not the end of the matter.\n\n\u201cWe have looked at this very carefully ... the UK government\u2019s position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolas\u2019 case, because she has returned home.\u201d\n\nMr Raab added that the matter was now \u201cin the hands\u201d of Northamptonshire Police and the CPS.\n\nAn FCO spokesman told PA that the office \u201cwould not be commenting further on the content of the letter\u201d.\n\nBefore the letter was sent by the FCO, the family\u2019s lawyer Mark Stephens told PA: \u201cThere are approximately 20,000 official diplomats in this country \u2013 there\u2019s a definitive list of who is and who isn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWe know definitively that this guy was not a diplomat and therefore was not entitled to diplomatic immunity. That has a number of consequences.\n\n\u201cThat means that the Americans have made a false claim. She would not have been entitled to claim diplomatic immunity.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ms Sacoolas\u2019s legal representative Amy Jeffress said: \u201cAnne is devastated by this tragic accident.\n\n\u201cNo loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Boris Johnson, the prime minister, said America was \u201cabsolutely ruthless\u201d in its safeguarding of Ms Sacoolas following the decision to grant her diplomatic immunity.\n\nMr Johnson said although Donald Trump, the US president, was sympathetic towards Harry\u2019s family\u2019s views on the use of diplomatic immunity, the US was \u201cvery reluctant\u201d to allow its citizens to be tried abroad.\n\nSpeaking of taking their campaign to the US, Harry\u2019s family said in a statement that they \u201ccontinue to live in a nightmare\u201d and have so far been unable to grieve after his death.\n\nA statement released on behalf of the family said: \u201cAs if losing Harry was not enough, they now find themselves having to expend enormous time and energy, which they can ill afford, generating sufficient publicity to garner public support to persuade the US government to help achieve closure and return the driver Mrs Sacoolas to England to face the consequences of her actions.\u201d\n\nPress Association", "description": "Harry Dunn\u2019s family have\u00a0said they will only meet the US woman suspected of causing their son\u2019s death if she promises to return to Britain. Family spokesman Radd Seiger told Sky News the condition was a \u201cnon-negotiable red line in the sand\u201d if Anne Sacoolas wished to meet with the teenager\u2019s parents while they are in America.
