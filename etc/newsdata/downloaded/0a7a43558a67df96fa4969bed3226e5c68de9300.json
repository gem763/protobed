It was the kind of bumper increase that\u2019s become a scourge of up-and-coming areas across Spain in recent years -- all while official inflation averages about 1%.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear 1%, I laugh,\u201d the 69-year-old Del Pomar said in an interview. \u201cThe figure must be false, because many, many people now pay more than half their income just for an apartment.\u201d\n\nThe apparent disconnect between official statistics and real-world costs hints at a problem at the heart of European monetary policy: Despite the best efforts of the central bank and quantitative easing totaling 2.6 trillion euros, inflation remains stubbornly low. If the experiences of people like Del Pomar are anything to go by, gauges of consumer price growth could be undershooting because they\u2019re missing important inputs -- meaning European Central Bank policy is calibrated incorrectly.\n\nWith a new era of stimulus beginning and critics railing against central banks for their impotence, the question of how to calculate inflation is a crucial part of the debate. And the accuracy of euro-area housing statistics has long been a point of contention.\n\nS&P Global Ratings said this week the ECB should include homeowners\u2019 costs in housing calculations. That would likely take it down another policy path, toward financial stability and away from easing, according to S&P economist Sylvain Broyer.\n\n\u201cIf the ECB had been targeting this higher inflation measure, they might have refrained from restarting QE in September,\u201d Broyer said in an interview.\n\nIn Europe there are no private figures on housing costs for government statisticians to use as a comparison, and somehow they have become minimized in inflation readings in Spain and many developed countries. Home purchase prices, which tend to lead or track rents, are climbing about 5% a year in Spain and 4% in the euro zone overall.\n\nS&P reckons that if the ECB took into account prices of owner-occupied dwellings, its CPI measure would increase by 0.3 percentage points and fuel a \u201csustainable rise\u201d in the central bank\u2019s inflation expectations.\n\nSpain is trying to improve the way it takes the temperature of the housing market and will unveil a new index next month. Most rental contracts for new apartments entering the market are excluded from inflation, according to a Bank of Spain report. Asking prices for rent jumped 50% nationwide in the previous 5 1/2 years, the research showed. Government statisticians figured housing costs rose barely 3% in the period.\n\nThe nation\u2019s consumer-price reading and the bond market are unlikely to be rocked just yet, however. Government and central bank officials wouldn\u2019t speculate on whether the new index might reflect more robust price growth, or if it will be used in CPI, which currently puts annual consumer inflation at just 0.2%.\n\nA spokesperson for Eurostat, which compiles price data, said that while revising the inflation index to capture more housing costs was considered and rejected in 2018, \u201cresearch will continue.\u201d An ECB spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nEurostat calculations assume consumers spend more on water, power and gas than they do on their rent. In Spain\u2019s case, it implies a household with 2,000 euros a month in disposable income pays only 60 euros a month in rent.\n\n\u201cHow can 60 euros a month cover the cost of housing?\u201d said Boris Courn\u00e8de, a veteran economist at the Organization of Economic Development who wrote a 2005 research paper studying the impact of excluding housing from CPI calculations. \u201cA campground fee would be more than that.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, housing is weighted at about 33% of the U.S. spending basket.\n\nRead more: U.S. homebuyers head south as university costs outpace wages.\n\nSpain\u2019s new index was not meant for calculating inflation. It was demanded by a 2019 law as a tool for curbing rental spikes that have driven tenants from neighborhoods where they\u2019ve lived for decades -- which is exactly what happened to Del Pomar.\n\nLike tens of millions of Europeans, housing is his biggest monthly expense. Yet it is minimized in inflation statistics, the undershooting of which have implications for everything from bond pricing and wage increases to pension payments across the $14 trillion euro-area economy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a big part of housing consumption that\u2019s not in consumer prices,\u201d Courn\u00e8de said.", "description": "Rents Cost Less Than Tents in Europe's Twisted Inflation Data", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic89fcdd7b2cf84bea5d69c69fbbed01cd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
