She had refused to discuss her son's treatment in a call with police on October 18. A warrant for Abak's arrest was issued Thursday as an urgent hunt was launched\n\nIn a court affidavit, Dr. Melissa Acquazzino, of Nebraska Pediatric Practice, said the boy is in imminent danger.\n\nShe put his chances of being cured at 60% with treatment and 0% without it.\n\nAcquazzino said she believed it a 'matter of immediate and urgent necessity' that the child be placed in the custody of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\n\nPolice on October 9 spoke with the boy's father, who said Abak took their son to Arizona to get a second opinion because the treatments were making him sick.\n\nWhen Rehan called Lincoln police investigator Luis Herrera on October 18, he asked if she was getting medical treatment for their son but she refused to discuss it, according to an arrest warrant issued Thursday.\n\n'She was asked again and she would not answer, then later indicated she would not be returning to Nebraska,' Herrera said.\n\nPolice say it doesn't appear that Prince is receiving any medical care, as the boy's medical reports haven't been requested by any medical facility or provider and there hasn't been any activity detected on his Medicaid account.", "description": "Abak Rehan is accused of taking her son Prince after he missed appointments at a hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, for treatment of Rhabdomyosarcoma.
