They are close friends but couldn\u2019t be more different. In fact, there are few like Sinema, the youngest Democrat at 43 who\u2019s trying to figure out how to teach a spin class in the archaic Senate gym and boasts a sense of style that stands out in the tradition-bound Senate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sort of a prude and she\u2019s very exotic,\u201d Cramer explained of their contrasting demeanor. \u201cShe was very hard on President Obama. So she\u2019s quite feisty.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s one Republican who\u2019s still at arm\u2019s length from Sinema: Martha McSally, whom Sinema defeated in 2018 but was then quickly appointed to fill the seat of the late Sen. John McCain. McSally said that the two \u201cleft it all out there on the field during the campaign\u201d and Sinema said their staffs work together.\n\nBut after a race in which McSally accused Sinema of saying \u201cIt\u2019s OK to commit treason,\u201d and Sinema said McSally was spreading \"smears,\" there\u2019s been no real attempt to put the past behind them.\n\nSinema isn\u2019t out for revenge, either. She\u2019s currently uncommitted in McSally\u2019s campaign against Democrat Mark Kelly and has no plans to weigh in. She said her constituents \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d about endorsements.\n\nThat neutral stance might buy her goodwill with her Republican colleagues, who are in the majority, after all. But it\u2019s another reminder that her moderate stance doesn\u2019t play well with all Democrats. The state Democratic Party put off a censure vote against her this year, but could revive it next year.\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, a progressive Democrat from Arizona, said Democrats were \u201ca little thrown back\u201d by her vote for Barr and warned her not to forget her state\u2019s increasingly young, diverse voting population as she navigates the tricky politics of being from a swing state.\n\n\u201cShe runs her own thing. It worked for her getting elected. In terms of effectiveness, we\u2019ll see,\u201d Grijalva said. \u201cI would be more concerned about not reflecting where the demographics in Arizona are going. And they\u2019re going Democratic and they\u2019re going more progressive.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Sinema won\u2019t fight the effort and won\u2019t change her positions. And if the censure resolution comes back up next year? \u201cI don\u2019t know. Also, don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nSinema\u2019s attempt to be above the political fray is central to her identity and her goal of building relationships with as many colleagues as possible.\n\nParty leaders\u2019 whip counts? Not her problem. Using her platform as senator to regularly promote her views to a national audience? Not interested. Skipping caucus lunches almost everyone else attends? She\u2019ll be there when it matters for Arizona.\n\nAnd missing votes on the EPA chief for an Ironman race?\n\n\u201cIronman\u2019s pretty badass. It\u2019s awesome,\u201d she responded when asked if she got any criticism for skipping town for New Zealand just two months into her term.\n\nLess awesome, in her view, is the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. And with her party fixated on beating both McSally and Trump in Arizona, Sinema\u2019s endorsement or even guidance for candidates about how to win there could be key.\n\nBut that\u2019s not something she\u2019s interested in, either. She even said it\u2019s \u201cpremature\u201d to commit to supporting her own party\u2019s nominee at this point and indicated it could be months before she tunes into a debate.\n\n\u201cEventually it would be wonderful to have a candidate that shares the values of the majority of Americans,\u201d Sinema said cryptically. \u201cLet\u2019s winnow the field below like, 20 or something, and then maybe it gets easier. Like, when it\u2019s enough for two basketball teams, it\u2019s too much.\u201d\n\nHeather Caygle contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d5/f8/a38ad08d47e78d19996f6c0b0a03/191028-sinema-politico-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
