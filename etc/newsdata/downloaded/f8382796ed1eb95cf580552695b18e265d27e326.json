Previously, he worked at the French APE state holding company and at the finance ministry.\n\nLazard said in a statement it had also appointed Charles-Henri Filippi and Fran\u00e7ois Kayat as co-chairs.\n\nFilippi joined the firm in 2018 from Citigroup and has also worked at HSBC and Credit Commercial de France. He began his career in the French civil service and government departments.\n\nKayat joined Lazard in 2010 from Credit Agricole CIB. Previously, he chaired the European Mergers and Acquisitions Group of Credit Suisse First Boston.\n\nLazard, founded in New Orleans in 1848 by three French brothers, opened its Paris Investment Banking office in 1854.\n\nToday, it is one of the firm's principal investment banking offices, and the base of several global investment banking businesses, in particular sovereign advisory, Africa/Middle East and Central & Eastern Europe advisory, Lazard said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Gwenaelle Barzic; Writing by GV De Clercq; editing by David Evans)", "description": "Lazard  said on Sunday it had appointed Jean-Louis Girodolle as CEO of Lazard Investment Banking in France, just a week after its chairman and CEO Matthieu Pigasse resigned.
