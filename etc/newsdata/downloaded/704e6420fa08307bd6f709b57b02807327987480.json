Erickson and Jim Ayello as they discuss the Colts upsetting the Kansas City Chiefs 19-13. Clark Wade, Clark.Wade@Indystar.com\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2013 A star is emerging in Indianapolis, even if the rest of the country is only starting to notice its light.\n\nTo be fair, he\u2019s not the red-carpet, sound-bite type, the kind of guy who finds the spotlight as soon as he walks into the room.\n\nMarlon Mack is quiet. Unassuming. Overlooked, at least by the national media, a group that spent the offseason saying the Colts need to replace him. The rare running back who gets less publicity than his offensive line.\n\nFive games into his third season, it\u2019s time for the rest of the NFL to realize what the city of Indianapolis has been watching this season.\n\nMack has developed into one of the best young running backs in the NFL.\n\n\u201cHe may not get the recognition that a lot of these other guys do,\u201d Colts quarterback Jacoby Brissett said. \u201cOne thing they do know is that when 25 has the ball in his hand, it\u2019s special.\u201d\n\nIndianapolis Colts running back Marlon Mack (25) navigates around defense during the fourth quarter of their game at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., on Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019.

He\u2019s right on target.\u201d\n\nOne by one, Mack has been eliminating the knocks on his game.\n\nDraft analysts considered him a complementary back, a player who couldn\u2019t carry the load as a lead back, and after Mack missed six games in his first two seasons, there were some who said he wasn\u2019t durable enough, even though running back is one of the NFL\u2019s most physically-demanding positions.\n\nMack has worked hard to stay on the field. After a hamstring injury cost him four games last year \u2014 and likely his first 1,000-yard season \u2014 Mack began getting a daily massage, a \u201cflush\u201d designed to loosen up his legs and protect his hamstrings. When he first came into the league, Mack didn\u2019t realize how important the massages could be; he didn\u2019t get many at all as a rookie.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know how important it was,\u201d Mack said.\n\nHe knows now.\n\nIndianapolis Colts running back Marlon Mack (25) runs the ball during the first quarter of their game at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., on Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019. (Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar)\n\nAnd he\u2019s been tough enough to play through pain. The ankle injury Mack suffered against the Raiders was serious enough that he traveled to Kansas City unsure if he\u2019d be able to play; he headed out to the field at Arrowhead Stadium early on Sunday, a legitimate game-time decision.\n\nMack ran, tested out the ankle, then headed back into the locker room and told the Colts coaching staff he was ready to go.\n\nIndianapolis responded by putting the game on his back, handing him 29 carries and three receptions in a tour de force performance on NBC\u2019s Sunday Night Football.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty banged up, but you\u2019ve got to have mental toughness,\u201d Mack said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go out there and fight for your team.\u201d\n\nMack\u2019s always had the burst, always had the speed.\n\nThe key is that he knows when to hit the afterburners now. Mack has become one of the most patient runners in the NFL, adept at both setting up the blocks of his offensive linemen and buying time until the hole opens. Mack averages 3.09 seconds behind the line of scrimmage, the second-most in the league, trailing only Cowboys backup Tony Pollard.\n\nMack sometimes waits so long to make a move that he makes the other Colts running backs nervous.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Dang, is he going to cut it up?\u2019\u201d Nyheim Hines said. \u201cAnd then he kind of waits, pauses, comes around the corner and (gets) tackled for like seven and a first down.\u201d\n\nWatch the longest run Mack broke against the Chiefs on Sunday night.\n\nMack takes the handoff on Brissett\u2019s left. Hops forward. Takes a half-step right, sees something to his left, course-corrects back up the middle. Two Chiefs linebackers are waiting for him. A hole opens in Mack\u2019s peripheral vision. Slides two steps to the left. Darts through the hole. Steps through a tackle, feels space to his right and hits the burners through the secondary for a 30-yard gain.\n\nAnd then NBC color analyst Cris Collinsworth starts crowing about the block of left guard Quenton Nelson, the breakout star of the Colts running game, a player who gets far more recognition than Mack.\n\nCollinsworth wasn\u2019t wrong. Nelson has been fantastic, along with the rest of a Colts offensive line that is capable of overpowering just about anybody.\n\nThere have also been a lot of runs this season where Mack has created his own room, has looked into a jumbled mess at the line of scrimmage and found a crease, or juked his way past a defender in the backfield, or powered his way forward and pushed the pile for a first down.\n\nRunning backs aren\u2019t always known for their decision-making; Mack\u2019s has been remarkable.\n\nIndianapolis Colts running back Marlon Mack (25) runs the ball during the third quarter of their game at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., on Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019. (Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar)\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s really helped him skyrocket,\u201d Hines said. \u201cThe line\u2019s really great, but Marlon\u2019s starting to figure out reads and how things should go.\u201d\n\nThe Colts have responded by handing Mack more carries than any back in the NFL other than McCaffrey.\n\nFor Frank Reich, this is something of a new development. At most of his previous coaching stops, he\u2019s directed running-back-by-committee approaches, and Indianapolis still finds ways to use Hines in a third-down role and give Jordan Wilkins a chance to make big plays in relief of Mack.\n\nBut Mack has earned the right to handle a lead back\u2019s workload.\n\n\u201cWe all have a preference for great players, right?\u201d Reich said earlier this season. \u201cI\u2019ve just mostly been in systems where it\u2019s been a little bit more by committee.\u201d\n\nIf anything, Indianapolis might need to dial back Mack\u2019s workload as the season progresses, take a few more carries off of him in order to help him stay healthy for games like Sunday\u2019s showdown against the Chiefs.\n\nMack had no problem with his workload in Arrowhead. He knew he\u2019d have time to rest.\n\n\u201cIce it up, we\u2019re heading into the bye week,\u201d Mack said. \u201cTreat my body well, relax a little bit and get ready for the week after that.\u201d\n\nIf he keeps it up, Mack might even start to get the attention he deserves.\n\nFollow IndyStar Colts Insider Joel A.
