No doubt that the Gold Futures look too strong since the announcement of a sharp drop in September's consumer confidence continues to weigh upon the U.S. equity indices. On the other hand, Europe has led the way in portfolio purchases of gold this year as the European Central Bank has been forced to cut its key interest rate even further below zero. I find that the steady gold looks evident enough to reflect the growing weakness in global equity markets.\n\nOn analysis of the movements of , in different time frames, on September 24th, 2019, I find that Nifty 50 struggled a lot to defend the level of 11,600 and finally closed at 11,588; but . Nifty 50 remained in weaker territory, despite struggling hard; but look ready to create a gap-down on September 25th, 2019 due to evaporated news flow. No doubt that a gap-down opening in Nifty 50 may attract more bears to remain aggressive below the levels of 11,511; and may push the Nifty 50 below the level of 11,444. I find that Nifty 50 may try to bounce back from lower levels but every upward move may face renewed sell-off; amid growing volatility.\n\nI find that the unresolved tariff trade war between the United States and China and a global downturn in the automotive sector have hammered manufacturers all over the world; and the Indian automobile sectors have been constantly facing slow demand at the domestic level, which looks continue to extend bearish pressure on . Secondly, the Nifty Bank and Nifty PSU Banks have also been constant extending bearish pressure over Nifty Index, despite the announcement of boosting packages for banking sectors; which are likely to have their positive impact in longer-term on the banking sector.\n\nFinally, I conclude that the will have to struggle more hard to defend the levels of 11,080 before the weekly closing. I find that the growing bearishness in UK 100 and may extend more exhaustion in Nifty 50 during the upcoming weeks if the Nifty 50 remains in negative territory till the weekly closing.
