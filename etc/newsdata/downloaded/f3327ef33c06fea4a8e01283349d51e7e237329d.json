A scientist has figured out how to use cheap household materials to create gravity crystals to study the exotic interiors of distant dead stars right here on Earth.\n\nThe new concept was developed by Alexander Bataller, a physicist at North Carolina State University, who will present his research this week at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society\u2019s Division of Plasma Physics in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nBataller was inspired to develop an accessible technique that could demonstrate Wigner crystallization, which is a pattern that forms when electrons experience a very specific set of conditions.\n\nTo create a Wigner crystal, electrons must be confined to a space that forces them to remain close together even though they naturally repel each other. These conditions are met in white dwarf stars, which are the remnants of stars that have exploded in supernova and collapsed into super-dense spheres about the size of Earth.\n\nAluminum spheres demonstrating Wigner crystallization.

He found that Wigner crystals can be simulated by applying an electric charge to balls made of aluminum and copper. These balls, which represent the electrons, are placed into a regular mixing bowl that keeps them confined by gravity.\n\nThe material \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to be metal per se, as long as they\u2019re charged and rolling around inside of a bowl or a gravity well, as you might call it,\u201d Bataller explained. \u201cThat\u2019s why I gave them the name \u2018gravity crystals\u2019 because what ties everything together is to use gravity as the confining force.\u201d\n\nBataller found that a number of different materials could simulate Wigner crystallization at these macro scales, including insulators like Teflon balls charged up with static electricity inside shot glasses.\n\nThe technique is mainly intended to be an educational technique that can demonstrate a classical system in an affordable way.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping to do is outreach for undergraduates and high school students to use this platform to do science,\u201d Bataller said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cool educational tool for students to get experimental experience in a really accessible system.\u201d", "description": "Physicist Alexander Bataller recreated exotic cosmic phenomena on Earth using household materials.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dadb7a35c1f5f000a31b38a/lede/1571665894102-GettyImages-494736293.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.84375xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
