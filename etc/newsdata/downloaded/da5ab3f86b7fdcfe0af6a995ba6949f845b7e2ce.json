REUTERS/Stringer\n\nMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia on Monday urged countries in the Middle East and outside the region not to draw \u201chasty conclusions\u201d on who staged the attacks on Saudi oil facilities.\n\nA senior U.S. official said earlier that evidence from the attack, which hit the world\u2019s biggest oil-processing facility, indicated Iran was behind it, instead of the Yemeni Houthi group that had claimed responsibility.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a potential response to the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked about the U.S. statement, said: \u201cWe have a negative attitude towards rising tensions in the region and call for all countries in the region and outside of it to avoid any hasty steps or conclusions which may deepen destabilisation.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement on Monday, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said it believed that the exchange of strikes on civilian targets was \u201ca direct consequence of the ongoing sharp military and political crisis in Yemen\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is counterproductive to use what happened to increase tensions around Iran in line with the well-known U.S. policy,\u201d the foreign ministry said.\n\n\u201cProposals on tough retaliatory actions, which appear to have been discussed in Washington are even more unacceptable.\u201d", "description": "Russia on Monday urged countries in the Middle East and outside the region not to draw \"hasty conclusions\" on who staged the attacks on Saudi oil facilities.", "authors": ["Maria Tsvetkova", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430439290&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0TN", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
