It should be in our curriculums, it should be taught so that we cannot repeat any of these mistakes of the past.'\n\nMr Frydenberg made his call after the Australian Jewish News this week published an image of a 12-year-old Jewish schoolboy from Cheltenham Secondary College being forced to kiss the feet of a Muslim boy a year older than him at a park.\n\nThis occurred as a group threatened the boy with violence if he didn't comply.\n\nThe incident has highlighted a wider pattern of anti-Semitism in Australia.\n\nLast year, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry found there was a 60 per cent increase in such incidents in just a year.\n\nThe Australian Jewish News has also highlighted more cases of anti-Semitism, this time involving children.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg, whose mother survived the Holocaust, has spoken out about that incident captured on camera in Melbourne. The Liberal Party's deputy leader used that episode, involving Cheltenham Secondary College students, to call for more education about the Holocaust, which saw six million Jews murdered\n\nIt revealed how a five-year-old boy at another Melbourne school was called a 'Jewish cockroach' by his classmates and became so scared of using the toilet that he wet himself, after other boys ridiculed him for being circumcised.\n\n'The reports today about young children as young as five being attacked and abused because of their Jewishness is completely unacceptable in our civilised society,' Mr Frydenberg said.\n\nDuring this year's election campaign Mr Frydenberg, who is one of three Jewish MPs in the House of Representatives, had swastikas spray painted in his election posters.\n\nHis Liberal colleague Julian Leeser also had his election material defaced with a vile Hitler moustache and a swastika.\n\nLast month, a swastika was spray painted on a billboard promoting a Melbourne theatre production of The Diary of Anne Frank, about a Jewish woman who hid from the Nazis in the Netherlands.\n\n'These reports just indicate a growing trend across the community of a 60 per cent rise in anti-Semitic incidents,' Mr Frydenberg said.\n\n'In Victoria, we saw swastikas, not just across political material including my own in the election, but also material promoting a play by Anne Frank of all people.\n\n'That is just sickening.'\n\nThe Labor Opposition is divided about the idea of pursuing whether Mr Frydenberg is a dual citizen, which would make him ineligible to remain in Parliament under Section 44 of the Constitution.\n\nHis mother Erica Strausz was born in a concentration camp in Hungary in 1943 and was possibly left stateless as a result.\n\nOutside of Parliament, Mr Frydenberg is close friends with Labor backbencher Ed Husic, the first Muslim elected to the House of Representatives.", "description": "Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, whose mother survived the Holocaust, has spoken out about that incident captured on camera in Melbourne.
