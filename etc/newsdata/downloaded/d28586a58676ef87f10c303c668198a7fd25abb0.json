Senator Cormann said the government's broader retirement income review would not lead to any changes to superannuation or pensions.\n\nAt least a dozen Liberal backbenchers want the super increase scrapped or reviewed, arguing the higher compulsory savings will cost workers pay rises and divert money from workers' pockets to underperforming and fee-charging fund managers.\n\n'Moral obligation' to fix the system\n\nLabor's shadow minister for financial services, Stephen Jones, said: \"Paul has nailed it.\n\n\"You\u2019d have to be a vandal to want to wind back our super system.\n\n\"Superannuation is a national achievement which sits alongside Medicare and the NDIS, which has made our nation stronger and our society fairer.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Every Australian deserves to retire with dignity and economic security.\"\n\nAssistant Minister for Superannuation Jane Hume has described the government as having a \u201cmoral\u201d obligation to fix the super system before moving to 12 per cent.\n\nThe Productivity Commission found unintended multiple accounts and entrenched underperforming funds were harming millions of members and fixing these problems could benefit members to the tune of $3.8 billion each year.\n\nIn the letter, Mr Keating attacked Mr Willox, former Productivity Commission super inquiry head Karen Chester, Grattan Institute chief John Daley and editor-in-chief of The Australian Finanicial Review Michael Stutchbury, for allegedly undermining the compulsory super system and union-aligned industry super funds.\n\nMr Keating also took an implicit swipe at former Liberal federal treasurer and Future Fund chairman Peter Costello, saying super should not be invested in \"some government fund\".\n\nMr Costello has suggested the government could set up a low-fee, less conflicted government fund to manage people's super, with the government's $166 billion Future Fund perhaps playing a support role advising on asset allocation and picking the best investment managers.\n\nMr Costello is chairman of Nine, owner of AFR Weekend.\n\nA Labor source said the Keating letter was a \"rallying cry\" for Labor and that he was enlisted for a fight on superannuation and issues tied to the retirement income review.", "description": "Anthony Albanese has enlisted Paul Keating for a fight against the government to defend superannuation and hit back against calls to stop the rise in super guarantee rate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9439%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_61%2C$y_193/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/606270fd0e1d40afd16b0e29b13566bd85b70882", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
