In doing so, he set out to advance a political and ideological cause.\n\n'In particular, as to the two charges he faces, his attendance at two places of training amounts, in each instance, to a criminal offence, because the law does not permit attendance at terrorist training places, anywhere in the world.'\n\nThe jury were shown images of James during his trip to the Middle East\n\nJurors were told James travelled to a safe house in Makhmour, Iraq and lived there between the end of August and the start of October 2017.\n\nMr Heywood argued that, while there, he received training with weapons by the PKK, before moving on to Syria until November 4 2017, where he was further trained by the YPG and went to fight in battles in Syria.\n\nPolice and Prevent officers became aware of Aidan's views following a series of Facebook posts, jurors heard.\n\nIn one on 19 April 2019 he wrote: 'The road to Rojava starts here, few weeks from now will be in Syria fighting side by side with brothers in arms against the sick regime and ideologies of the so called daesh and other Islamic extremist.\n\n'I don't care for people's opinions this is what I want to do and need to do'.\n\nThe officers warned him not to travel for his own safety and offered him help, but suspected their warnings had not worked.\n\nOn 28 April he was arrested and interviewed by the police while his mother's house was searched.\n\nA journal and his passport were found and retained for a while by investigators, but they announced he would be not investigated further.\n\nJames gave the impression he was intent on travelling, and on 17 July 2017 his passport along with his journal were returned, the court heard. The following month he was in the Middle East.\n\nJames, of Formby, Merseyside, denies two charges of attending terrorist training camps. The trial continues.", "description": "Aidan James, of Formby, Merseyside, is on trial at the Old Bailey accused of joining a proscribed group called the PKK or the Kurdish Worker's Party, which was made illegal in 2001.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Crime Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/16/19700130-0-image-a-51_1571068395067.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
