Winston made it to the finish of Tampa\u2019s 37-26 loss to Carolina in London, but with a career-worst five interceptions - and an oh-by-the-way fumble for a sixth giveaway.\n\nWinston has an NFL-worst 86 giveaways since entering the league and five games with at least four turnovers while no other player has more than two during that span.\n\n\u201cThrow the damn ball away,\u201d coach Bruce Arians said. \u201cHe has a habit of trying to be Superman. That\u2019s been a problem in the past. The fumbles haven\u2019t occurred this year until today. But again, trying to make something out of nothing. It\u2019s just a matter of knowing when to quit on a play.\u201d\n\nMariota has a better record (29-32 compared to 23-37) and a slightly better ratio of touchdowns to interceptions, while both have similarly mediocre passer ratings in the high 80s.\n\nThe problem for Mariota is that Titans are near the bottom in points and total yards and have been shut out twice since the start of 2018. Ryan Tannehill, a former starter in Miami, replaced Mariota and was 13 of 16 for 144 yards and one interception. He was sacked four times.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not pulling our weight as an offense,\u201d Mariota said. \u201cWe have to find a way to improve and change that because our defense is playing lights out.\u201d\n\nTitans coach Mike Vrabel didn\u2019t want to discuss who would be the starter going forward.\n\nBetween Mariota and Winston, Mariota has the only playoff appearance. He won a wild-card game during the 2017 season. Neither has signed a second contract, which means both are in the fifth and final years of their rookie deals.\n\nSo both teams have decisions to make in the offseason, if not sooner.\n\n\u201cSometimes I do want to do great things,\u201d Winston said. \u201cBut you can do great things but protect the team at the same time.\u201d\n\nFAST START, QUICK FADE\n\nDallas and the Los Angeles Rams, divisional-round foes last postseason, have matching 3-0 starts followed by three-game losing streaks.\n\nThe Cowboys lost to the previously winless New York Jets 24-22 after trailing 21-3 on the road. That was a week after a 34-24 home loss to Green Bay that included a 31-3 deficit.\n\nThe slump is a little more surprising from the Rams considering their 24-8 regular-season record the first two years under coach Sean McVay, capped by a Super Bowl appearance last season.\n\nLA\u2019s 20-7 loss to undefeated NFC West leader San Francisco gave the Rams three straight losses under McVay for the first time, while the Cowboys have lost three straight for the first time since the first half of star running back Ezekiel Elliott\u2019s six-game suspension two years ago.\n\n\u201cWas it a humbling day for us? Absolutely,\u201d McVay said. \u201cBut it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to learn from. We\u2019re not going to let it demoralize us. They did a nice job. We didn\u2019t do enough collectively.\u201d\n\nCowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones was asked about the future of coach Jason Garrett after the stunning loss, brushing it off as something he wasn\u2019t even considering. Despite the slide, the Cowboys are tied with Philadelphia atop the NFC East and hosting the Eagles next Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re 0-0 right now,\u201d quarterback Dak Prescott said. \u201cWe have a huge game next week. It\u2019s for first in our division. We have to figure out a way to turn this page and focus on exactly that and how do we become a better offense. Everything, as crazy as it is, is still ahead of us.\u201d\n\nPERFECT WITHOUT BREES\n\nFor the third time in four starts filling in for Drew Brees, Teddy Bridgewater had modest numbers. The New Orleans Saints don\u2019t care. They\u2019re 4-0 without the NFL\u2019s all-time passing leader, and that much closer to getting him back from a torn thumb ligament.\n\nThe initial diagnosis was six weeks for Brees, which means the club probably will face a decision after next week\u2019s visit to Chicago. The Saints (5-1) play Arizona at home on Oct. 27 before their open week.\n\nNew Orleans handed Dallas its first loss in Week 4 without scoring a touchdown, then didn\u2019t allow Jacksonville a TD in Sunday\u2019s 13-6 victory. The only touchdown was Bridgewater\u2019s tiebreaking TD toss to Jared Cook early in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cEach week we just talk about how do we win that game,\u201d Payton said. \u201cHonestly, in a week or two weeks from now, we\u2019re not going to look specifically to how we win certain games.\u201d\n\nYeah, because Brees will be back somewhere in there.\n\nHOT UP NORTH\n\nMinnesota\u2019s 38-20 victory over the Eagles gives the NFC North a chance to be the only division with four winning teams through six weeks, while it ended up leaving the NFC East without a team above .500.\n\nIf Detroit beats Green Bay on Monday night, the Vikings (4-2) and Packers (currently 3-2) would be tied for the division lead, followed closely by the Lions (currently 2-1-1) and defending NFC North champion Chicago (3-2).\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Marcus Mariota might be out as the starting quarterback in Tennessee, while the Tampa Bay Buccaneers might have to decide how many more interceptions they can afford from Jameis Winston.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/titans_broncos_football_23446_c0-204-4895-3059_s1200x700.jpg?8b97c584551911a75ef1791227739dcc0078080e", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
