The estate will implement a car park fee from February to assist with the increasing cost of maintaining facilities and to fund future developments.'\n\nThe country park \u2013 part of her 20,000-acre Norfolk estate \u2013 is having a cafe, visitor centre and gift shop update with new Royal souvenirs. Paths and an arboretum will be built\n\nNew pathways will be built and work is also set to start on an arboretum but for the first time visitors will have to pay to park.\n\nA spokesman for the Royal Estate said: 'Every year, thousands of people are welcomed to the Sandringham Estate to enjoy the country park, house, museum and gardens throughout the seasons.\n\n'In recent years, the number of people and vehicles to the estate has increased significantly, particularly in the country park, which received over 500,000 visitors last year.\n\n'In light of the increase in numbers, the estate is undergoing some redevelopments with a view to offering improved facilities for visitors, while also maintaining the landscape and environment for all to enjoy.\n\n'The estate will implement a car parking charge from February next year in order to assist with the increasing cost of maintaining existing facilities and to allow funding for future developments to improve the visitor experience.'\n\nIn 1862, Sandringham House with its estate was bought as a country home for Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, who had just turned 21.\n\nQueen Victoria and Prince Albert had decided that he should move from the family home to a house of his own and it was felt he should have a private house to escape to when duty permitted and enjoy the benefits of a healthy country life.\n\nThe Prince moved in soon after his marriage in 1863 but it soon became clear that her house was too cramped for the Prince's growing family and it was demolished to make way for a new house, designed by a local Norfolk architect. The main house was completed in 1870, a ballroom was added in 1881 and a new guest accommodation wing in the 1890s.\n\nThe gardens at Sandringham were first opened to the public by King Edward VII in 1908, and the Queen opened the house itself to the public in her Silver Jubilee year, 1977.\n\nVisitors will not be charged for the first 20 minutes but after that, they will have to pay \u00a33 for up to two hours, \u00a35 for up to four and \u00a37 per day.\n\nBut there will be season tickets on offer for regular visitors costing from \u00a340 (single), \u00a360 (couple) and \u00a370 (family).", "description": "The country park - part of her 20,000-acre Norfolk estate - is having a cafe, visitor centre and gift shop update with new Royal souvenirs.
