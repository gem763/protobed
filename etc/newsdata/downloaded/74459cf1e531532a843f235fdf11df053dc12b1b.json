She's very entitled and spoiled, and is honestly just kind of a f****** bully.\n\n'She was known for it at school and it definitely hasn't stopped in her adult life. She's also getting married soon, oh joy.\n\n'We were both at mum's house the other day and she was talking about her plans for her bridal party. She said she's having six bridesmaids: our little half sister on dad's side, four of her close friends and our cousin.\n\n'I was pretty shocked that she wanted the cousin to be a part of the bridal party. She's a really awesome person and everything, but I didn't think she and my sister were close.\n\n'In fact, I didn't think she and my sister had even spoken for at least a year or two. Turns out I was right. Seeing mum and I were confused, sister laughed a bit and said \"Imagine how pretty we'll look in pictures with her!\"'\n\nSocial media users were divided, with some suggesting the sibling should tell her relative before refusing to attend her sister's wedding\n\nYet some said the sibling shouldn't tell her relative, with a third person saying: 'Don't tell your cousin.
