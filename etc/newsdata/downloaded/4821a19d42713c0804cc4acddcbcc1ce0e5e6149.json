This gives the appearance of an organisation wilfully concealing its own failure by using The Challenge as a scapegoat and passing onto our charity the cost, blame and operational impediment arising from the NCST\u2019s woeful mismanagement.\u201d\n\nMr Ronald went on the accuse the NCS\u2019s trust of leaving \u00a34m of basic core contractual payments for 2019 unpaid and refusing to \u201caccept catastrophic failures in its new centralised IT system\u201d.\n\nIn August The Challenge lost a contract believed to be worth more than \u00a360m a year to deliver youth schemes, a failure it blames on NCS.\n\nIn a statement Oliver Lee, chief executive of The Challenge, said: \"The Challenge has for several months been engaged with the trust and DCMS to attempt to resolve serious issues arising from the mismanagement of certain aspects of the NCS programme by the trust in 2019.\"\n\nMr Lee added that The Challenge \"remains committed to delivering our remaining responsibilities on the NCS 2019 autumn programme and to supporting future NCS providers through a smooth handover process\".\n\nThe NCS was launched by Mr Cameron as part of the Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat coalition government's Big Society initiative. In October 2016, following his resignation as Prime Minister, Mr Cameron became chairman of the NCS Trust's board of patrons.\n\nA spokesperson from NCS Trust said: \u201cIn July, we told The Challenge we would not contract with it for next year\u2019s NCS programme because we were unable to reach an agreement with the charity over a contractual requirement to use a shared IT system that ensures value for money, improves customer experience and protects young people\u2019s data.\n\n\u201cThe Challenge was very unhappy about this decision and, since then, it has made what we consider to be false allegations about NCS Trust before launching these legal proceedings, which we intend to robustly defend in court.\n\n\u201cSince our decision to end our relationship with The Challenge, we have completed a recommissioning designed to deliver value for money to the taxpayer and an even better experience for the young people that take part in our flagship youth programme.\u201d\n\nA DCMS spokeswoman said: \"We have received a complaint from an NCS provider about the NCS trust.\n\n\"In line with standard complaint procedures, we will be investigating the matters raised and will address any findings as appropriate.\"", "description": "One of the central planks of David Cameron\u2019s Prime Ministerial legacy is facing serious trouble, accused of putting hundreds of jobs and the hopes of thousands of young people at risk.", "authors": ["Patrick Sawer", "Senior News Reporter", "Ross Clark", "Daniel Hannan", "Robert Tombs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000072584164-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
