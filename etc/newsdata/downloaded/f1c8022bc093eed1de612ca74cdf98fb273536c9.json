They don\u2019t say anything back. They won\u2019t groan when you tell them it\u2019s going to rain, or smile when you tell a joke.\n\nAt the same time, those early weeks are shrouded in a cloud of exhaustion. My baby didn\u2019t sleep when he was meant to, which meant I couldn\u2019t either. It\u2019s no wonder that conversation wasn\u2019t exactly flowing.\n\nIt starts to feel easier when they become more responsive, but it still didn\u2019t come naturally to me to \u201ccoo\u201d in response to my baby\u2019s gurgles, or speak in \u201cbaby-ese\u201d with big, loud, slow vowel sounds. I would often look in awe as other, seemingly more parental types, would have whole conversations with my baby.\n\nA few months in, as babies start to respond more with babbles and giggles, it becomes easier. But studies show that some parent still do not speak to their children much, and that this can have lasting negative consequences \u2013 consequences even visible in the brain.\n\nIt was in the mid-1990s that a worrying discovery was made about a stark difference in language achievement in children. Researchers Betty Hart and Todd Risley went into homes of families from different socioeconomic groups, spending an hour each month recording them over more than two years.\n\nAnalysing the data, they found that children from the poorest backgrounds heard one-third as many words per hour as those from higher income backgrounds. Scaling up, they proposed that by the time the children were four years old, there would be a 30-million word gap between children from poor backgrounds compared to those in wealthier, professional households.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 The secret world of babies\n\n\u2022 How to be a good father\n\n\u2022 The hidden bias we often ignore\n\nThis study was far from ideal. It had a small sample size, and it\u2019s not clear if the word gap is as large as the researchers first suggested. Other critics have since shown that low-income children hear many more words than Hart and Risley reported when factoring in language they overhear from conversations both inside and outside the home. Responding to these critics, another group highlighted that \u201cyoung children do not profit from overheard speech about topics of interest to adults\u201d.", "description": "There could be a simple way to help young children\u2019s brains improve for the better, with long-lasting benefits.", "authors": ["Melissa Hogenboom"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7p/sr/p07psr8q.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
