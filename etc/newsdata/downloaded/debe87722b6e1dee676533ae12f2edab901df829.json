Photo: Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nSince the move du jour is asking very famous directors what they think of superhero movies, a reporter at the WSJ Tech Live event asked Disney CEO Robert Iger what he thinks about the likes of Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola speaking ill of movies like his big Marvel tentpoles. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me, except I\u2019m bothered on behalf of the people who work on those movies,\u201d Iger told the moderator of his in conversation event. \u201cThey\u2019re entitled to their own opinions. Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese are two people I hold in the highest regard in terms of the films they\u2019ve made, the films I like, the films that we\u2019ve all watched. But when Francis uses the words, \u2018Those films are despicable,\u2019 I reserve the word despicable for someone who committed mass murder. These are movies.\u201d\n\nWhile Coppola has called superhero movies \u201cdespicable,\u201d Scorsese compared them to amusement-park rides. Iger wondered which Disney-employed filmmakers the cinema legends were referring to \u2014 Ryan Coogler? Taika Waititi? Kevin Feige? \u201cI think I\u2019ve maybe sounded a little bit more defensive than I wanted to be. I don\u2019t really feel a need to defend what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Iger continued. \u201cIf they want to bitch about movies it\u2019s certainly their right. I just don\u2019t understand. It seems so disrespectful to all the people who work on those films, who are working just as hard as the people who work on their films. They\u2019re putting their creative souls on the line just like they are. You\u2019re telling me Ryan Coogler making Black Panther is doing something that is somehow less than what Marty Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola have ever done on one of their movies? Come on!\u201d So, Iger didn\u2019t want to sound defensive, but he did kind of want to say, Come through, Marty and Francis! Following light applause from the crowd, the Disney chief put a point on the matter by adding, \u201cI said it!\u201d", "description": "Disney CEO Bob Iger talks at a WSJ conference about directors like Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese belittling superhero movies, and says they\u2019re allowed \u201cto bitch\u201d if they want.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/23/23-bob-iger-wsj.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
