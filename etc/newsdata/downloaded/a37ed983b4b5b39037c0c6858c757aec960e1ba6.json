And as hopes build for U.S.-China trade talks next month, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index is less than half a percentage point below its record high close on July 26.\n\nThe message? The trade war giveth, and the trade war taketh away.\n\n\u201cClearly, the market has been very sensitive to any developments in U.S. China trade war,\u201d says Ameriprise Chief Market Strategist David Joy.\n\nOther forces are also at work. The world\u2019s central banks, including the Federal Reserve, are cutting interest rates or enacting other stimulus measures to goose their economies and put a floor under stocks. U.S. consumer spending, the economy\u2019s chief engine, continues to grow solidly. And long-term bond yields have climbed out of the depths, somewhat easing recession fears.\n\nBut stock analysts warn that more volatility lay ahead and the market is unlikely to rise significantly above its previous high until the U.S. and China reach a broad resolution of their trade standoff.\n\nTraders Patrick Casey, left, and Jonathan Corpina, center, work with specialist Jay Woods on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Wednesday, Aug. 14, 2019.

That means both indexes were about 6% above their late August lows and less than 1% off their record highs in July.\n\nSo far in 2019, the S&P 500 is up a healthy 20%. That means an investor with $100,000 in a 401(k) plan at the start of the year has seen that nest egg grow to $120,000.\n\nBut keep this in mind: The broad stock index is just 2.6% above its year-ago level, meaning wild swings linked mostly to developments in the trade war and Fed interest rate moves have left the market largely treading water.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick rundown of why markets have rebounded:\n\nThe trade war\n\nEarly last month, Trump tweeted that he would slap new tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese imports, mostly consumer products. Weeks later, he said he\u2019d hike those and earlier tariffs.\n\nBut early this month, U.S. and Chinese officials agreed to resume negotiations. And this week, China agreed to lift tariffs on American pork and soybean shipments to that country while Trump delayed tariffs set to take effect Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cBy lowering the pressure,\u201d Joy says, the olive branches \u201cgive them room to talk.\u201d\n\nYet in the short term, both Joy and Kinahan expect continued talks that may put off tariffs for several months, calming markets, rather than a deal on thorny issues such as China\u2019s theft of U.S. intellectual property.\n\nThe Fed and other central banks\n\nThe Fed lowered its key interest rate July for the first time in a decade despite a solid economy to head off a potential recession that could be set off by the trade conflict slowing global growth. It\u2019s expected to approve another quarter-point cut next week. Lower rates spur more borrowing and economic activity and prod investors to move money from low yielding bonds to stocks.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Central Bank on Thursday agreed to further cut its benchmark rate and buy 20 billion euros in bonds each month to push down long-term rates. Other central banks around the globe are similarly trimming rates to jolt sluggish economies. That helps S&P 500 companies, which derive about 40% of their sales from overseas.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Stocks were set to close hire Friday for the eighth straight day and third week.
