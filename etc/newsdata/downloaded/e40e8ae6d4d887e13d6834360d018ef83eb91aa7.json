In October of 2017, while reporting on sexual-assault accusations against the movie producer Harvey Weinstein, I learned that he had hired the Israeli private-intelligence agency Black Cube to surveil his accusers and the journalists trying to tell their stories. I had obtained a list of marks suggesting that the spy agency\u2019s operatives had approached the actress Rose McGowan, the writer Ben Wallace, and me. But I needed confirmation, and that would require an insider outraged enough to risk leaking the full details of the operation. I blanketed Tel Aviv, where Black Cube was based, with calls and e-mails, asking about the company\u2019s work for Weinstein. There was a formal denial from their freelance publicist, Eido Minkovsky, who flattered his way through our phone calls. \u201cMy wife\u2019s seen your pictures,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way she\u2019s gonna come to New York. She\u2019s not allowed to. I confiscated her visa.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a sweet talker,\u201d I said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s my game,\u201d Minkovsky replied. Two men close to the Black Cube operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, offered a similar denial. In a series of phone calls, they said that the agency had only done Internet research for Weinstein, and that its operatives had never contacted reporters or accusers. I pressed them about the names on the target list, including McGowan and another actress who had accused Weinstein of assault in my reporting, Annabella Sciorra. (Weinstein has denied \u201cany allegations of non-consensual sex.\u201d) \u201cWe never approached any of these,\u201d the man with the deeper of the two voices said. \u201cI also made sure with my team here, any of these you wrote here: Annabella Sciorra\u2026 Rose McGowan...\u201d I told them that both Ben Wallace and I suspected that we\u2019d been targeted. \u201cWe don\u2019t generally work on journalists as a target,\u201d came the reply. The man with the higher voice swore that they were telling the truth. \u201cWe\u2019re Talmud Jews!\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t swear for nothing!\u201d The calls were both ominous and entertaining. More in the Black Cube Chronicles Published on October 7, 2019. Published on October 8, 2019. Black Cube was founded in 2010, by Dan Zorella and Avi Yanus, two veterans of a secret Israeli intelligence unit. The agency stressed that its tactics had been vetted by attorneys around the world and that it stayed within the letter of the law. (The agency\u2019s agreement with Weinstein specified that all of the firm\u2019s activities would be conducted \u201cby legal means and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\u201d) But others in the private-intelligence world told me that Black Cube had a reputation for flouting rules. In 2016, two of its operatives were jailed in Romania, for intimidating a prosecutor and hacking her e-mails. They were later convicted, and received suspended sentences. One person involved with Black Cube\u2019s operations told me, \u201cit\u2019s impossible to do what they do without breaking the law.\u201d When I asked the head of a competing Israeli private-intelligence firm, who had had dealings with Black Cube, what I should do if I suspected that I was being followed by a Black Cube agent, he said, \u201cJust start running.\u201d\n\nThe two men close to the Black Cube operation had promised to send documents that would disprove any claims that Black Cube had followed accusers or reporters. \u201cI will send you the documents today,\u201d the lower voice said. \u201cWe\u2019ll use a one-time e-mail or one of our servers.\u201d Thirty minutes after they hung up, a message arrived from the encrypted-messaging service ProtonMail, with documents attached. Another message followed a few hours later, from a different e-mail service, Zmail, with more documents. I assumed that both messages were from the two men close to the Black Cube operation, though the ProtonMail message had an unusually intimate tone. \u201cHello mutual friend,\u201d it said. \u201cAttached you\u2019ll find new information concerning the HW&BC affair. Best, cryptoadmin.\u201d The ProtonMail account it came from bore the name Sleeper1973. Attached was an extensive record of Black Cube\u2019s work for Weinstein. The documents included their first contract, signed in late October, 2016, and a revision from July 11, 2017, which extended Black Cube\u2019s work for Weinstein through November of 2017. The later contract directed the spies to \u201cprovide intelligence which will help the Client\u2019s efforts to completely stop the publication of a new negative article in a leading NY Newspaper,\u201d a reference to reporting on Weinstein by the Times. The contract also directed them to obtain a copy of a memoir that McGowan was writing, which was described as \u201ca book which currently being written and includes harmful negative information on and about the Client.\u201d The agency agreed to hire \u201can investigative journalist,\u201d and an \u201cagent by the name of \u2018Anna\u2019\u201d for four months.

The contracts were signed by Black Cube\u2019s director, Avi Yanus, and by the law firm of Boies Schiller, which represented Weinstein. This was astonishing: Boies Schiller also represented the Times. But there was the signature of the firm\u2019s chairman, David Boies, in blue-inked cursive, on a contract to kill the paper\u2019s own reporting.\n\nThe next morning, I called the two men close to the Black Cube operation. I thanked them for sending the documents. They sounded cheerful, confident that what they had sent would exonerate the firm of conducting intrusive surveillance on Weinstein\u2019s behalf. \u201cWe did not approach any of these women undercover,\u201d the deeper of the two voices said. \u201cWe did not approach any of these journalists undercover.\u201d When I began asking questions about the contract that called for those very tactics, they sounded confused. They denied that such a contract existed.\u201cI\u2019m looking at it. It\u2019s on Black Cube\u2019s stationery,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m referring to a document you guys sent me.\u201d \u201cWhen you say, \u2018we guys,\u2019 what do you mean by \u2018we guys?\u2019 \u201d the deeper voice said, sounding cautious, even worried. \u201cThis was in the binder of documents that you sent to me yesterday,\u201d I said. \u201cNot the second dump from Zmail, but the very first one, from the Sleeper e-mail.\u201d There was a long silence on the line. \u201cWe did not send you any burner e-mail yesterday,\u201d the deeper voice said. \u201cThe only thing we sent you yesterday was from Zmail.\u201d Realization prickled my skin. The men had promised to send me Black Cube documents from a discreet e-mail account. What was the likelihood that someone would leak a conflicting, and more devastating, tranche of documents at exactly the same time? But that seemed like the only explanation. Anxious to protect the source, I changed the subject and told the two men that I had authenticated the contracts with David Boies and others. \u201cThey are genuine,\u201d I said. There was a touch of panic in the deeper voice. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know who sent that,\u201d the man said. Then, collecting himself, he added, \u201cWe should do this friendly, I would say.\u201d I wondered what the alternative would look like. After I got off the phone, I sent an e-mail to the Sleeper1973 address. \u201cCan you give any information that would help authenticate these documents? Some parties involved are denying several pieces of this.\u201d A response arrived immediately: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised they denied it, but it is all true. they were trying to get Rose\u2019s book, via a girl named \u2018Ana\u2019 (possibly a HUMINT agent).\u201d Another set of files was attached, which contained a wide range of correspondence and ancillary documents. Over time, these, too, checked out. My editors asked me to try to learn more about source, whom we started calling Sleeper. \u201cSleeper1973 is possibly a Woody Allen reference,\u201d I wrote, referring to a film directed by my father and released in 1973. \u201cWhich is certainly cheeky.\u201d Someone with a dark sense of humor, then. (I\u2019d publicly criticized my father after my sister accused him of sexual assault. He has denied the allegation.) Sleeper rebuffed my pleas for an encrypted call or an in-person meeting. \u201cI can understand your editors\u2019 concern although I\u2019m afraid to reveal my identity. Every online method can be monitored these days...its hard for me to trust it wont come back at me,\u201d Sleeper wrote. \u201cI\u2019m sure you know NSO so I\u2019m not interested in taking unnecessary risks.\u201d NSO Group is an Israeli cyber-intelligence firm known for developing software that can take control of a cell phone and strip-mine it for data. According to watchdog groups, the software has been used to target dissidents and journalists around the world. (NSO has said that the software is \u201cnot a product to track or surveil dissidents or journalists for doing their job; it\u2019s licensed only for the sole purpose of investigating or preventing crime and terror.\u201d) Sleeper continued sending information from the encrypted e-mail address, and it always proved accurate. After McGowan told me that she\u2019d spent time only with trusted contacts and couldn\u2019t think of anyone who might have been \u201cAnna,\u201d the undercover operative, I asked Sleeper for help. Another lightning-quick reply: \u201cRegarding Anna, her genuine name is Stella Pen. I\u2019ve attached pictures as well. She allegedly got 125 pages of Rose\u2019s book (as appears on BC\u2019s agreement with Boies), and discussed the findings with HW himself.\u201d Attached were three photos of a statuesque blonde with a prominent nose and high cheekbones. I texted the photos to McGowan and Ben Wallace. \u201cOh my God,\u201d McGowan wrote back. \u201cNo fucking way.\u201d For months, she had been meeting with the woman in the photos, who had claimed to be a women\u2019s-rights advocate working for a fictional wealth-management firm. Wallace remembered her immediately, too\u2014she\u2019d posed as a Weinstein victim. \u201cYes,\u201d he wrote back. \u201cWho is she?\u201d", "description": "In an excerpt drawn from his new book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d Farrow describes how a civil war among spies exposed Harvey Weinstein\u2019s attempts to suppress allegations of sexual assault and harassment.", "authors": ["Ronan Farrow", "Daniel Golden", "Doris Burke", "John Seabrook", "Anthony Lane"], "top_image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d9b9bd4f21ebb000974d326/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/BlackCube-eye-Final.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
