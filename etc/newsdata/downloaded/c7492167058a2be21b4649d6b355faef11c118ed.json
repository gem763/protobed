How McConnell\u2019s hemp push has made pot busts harder", "language": "en", "text": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images cannabis Marijuana Mitch? How McConnell\u2019s hemp push has made pot busts harder\n\nMitch McConnell\u2019s big victory for his home state hemp industry may have made it easier for people busted for marijuana to get off the hook.\n\nLast year, McConnell pushed to get a provision legalizing hemp into the farm bill. His goal was to spur hemp farming across the country and boost farmers in his home state of Kentucky who have been battered by a loss in federal tobacco subsidies.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: Hemp and marijuana products both come from the same plant, cannabis, which makes it nearly impossible for the average cop to tell the difference. As states rushed to change their hemp laws to capitalize on the federal changes, many municipalities are giving up on small-time pot busts because of a lack of reliable testing. Under federal and most state laws, hemp can\u2019t be more than 0.3 percent THC, the psychoactive compound that triggers a high. Before hemp was legal, police only had tests that could detect the presence of THC, not how much.\n\nNow that cannabis with less than 0.3 percent THC is legal, a growing number of prosecutors are requiring lab tests to bring charges. The mere presence of THC is no longer enough.\n\nFor example, in Texas, prosecutors were shocked by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s embrace of a hemp bill in June, said Paul Fortenberry, the narcotics division chief in the Harris County district attorney\u2019s office. The new law led to several district attorney\u2019s offices to set policies requiring lab testing in marijuana cases. Hundreds of people across the state happily had their cases dismissed.\n\nProsecutors in Florida, Ohio, Georgia and elsewhere have announced similar policies following hemp legalization laws. Five states legalized hemp this year and others expanded existing hemp programs because of the farm bill.\n\nPOLITICO Pro Cannabis High-quality coverage of one of the fastest growing industries in the country.

Mike DeWine signed the state\u2019s hemp legalization bill.\n\n\u201cI was not opposed to the law because of what it meant for Ohio farmers,\u201d Klein said. \u201cOur farmers have been particularly hit by President [Donald] Trump\u2019s trade war with China so it\u2019s a positive thing for our state \u2026 but it still doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t unintended consequences of this law.\u201d\n\nThe localities where changes have already been made are likely just the first of many.\n\n\u201cIt is a national issue. This is not anything that is limited to just a few states,\u201d said Duffie Stone, a South Carolina prosecutor and president of the National District Attorneys Association.\n\nHemp backers including McConnell, especially in conservative-leaning states, frame the hemp legalization issue as an agricultural one. The crop cannot be consumed as an intoxicating drug, and it can help otherwise struggling farmers access a booming global market worth $3.7 billion in 2018.\n\nBut the issue of hemp cuts across several issues. It\u2019s exactly this focus on agriculture that caught prosecutors off guard in the first place \u2014 the hemp bill in Texas went through the agriculture committee. \u201cTypically when we have a criminal justice bill, it will come through the criminal justice committee,\u201d Fortenberry said.\n\n\u201cLegislatures are seeing that other states have hemp programs worth tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, and they don\u2019t want farmers in their state to get left behind,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the process of doing that, I don\u2019t think that they foresaw this unintended consequence.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, South Dakota\u2019s legislature passed a hemp legalization bill that Republican Gov. Kristi Noem promptly vetoed, arguing that it would undermine marijuana enforcement. While lawmakers fell a few votes short of overriding her veto, they have vowed to try again in 2020.\n\n\u201cI find hard to believe [McConnell] would have moved [hemp legalization] in the same way had he been thinking about all these different implications,\u201d said Melissa Moore, deputy state director of the Drug Policy Alliance, an advocacy group that aims to reduce criminalization in drug policies.\n\nMcConnell has previously opposed efforts to liberalize marijuana laws and didn\u2019t return requests for comment for this report.\n\nThe farm bill essentially legalized hemp by removing it from the definition of marijuana under federal drug laws. Regulatory agencies haven\u2019t finalized rules for the newly legal industry, however, leaving the nearly $2 billion industry built on the hemp derivative CBD in a regulatory limbo. CBD is a trendy cannabis compound used for relieving anxiety, pain, inflammation and more, though research on its efficacy is slim. Hemp cultivars generally contain higher amounts of CBD and trace amounts of THC. Its industrial applications abound: Hemp is gaining attention for its environmental friendliness and can be used in textiles, construction, biofuels, and more.\n\nThe USDA aims to publish its proposed hemp regulations this fall and the FDA is trying to figure out how to regulate a compound that is already available as an FDA-approved pharmaceutical. While federal regulations prohibit CBD being added to food, supplements, and cosmetics, such products are widely available.\n\nCalifornia Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on politics and government in the Golden State.

Without some sort of lab results showing that the substance had more than the legal limit of THC, \u201cit just didn\u2019t make any sense to accept the case.\u201d\n\nTexas lawmakers were so dismayed by marijuana cases being tossed out that they wrote a letter to local prosecutors arguing that lab tests aren\u2019t required in every case. \u201cCriminal cases may be prosecuted with lab tests or with the tried and true use of circumstantial evidence,\u201d read the letter signed by the governor, lieutenant governor, House speaker, and state attorney general.\n\nSome smaller DA offices in the state agree. A spokesperson for the El Paso DA\u2019s office sent a statement pointing to a provision of the Texas Health and Safety Code for its decision to continue prosecuting marijuana cases without lab results.\n\nBut prosecutors in the state\u2019s more populous counties have a different view. \u201cIn this day and age, when you have the actual ability to determine whether something is a certain substance, juries expect you to bring you that evidence,\u201d Fortenberry said.\n\nBut the lack of testing equipment to differentiate between hemp and marijuana has overwhelmed state crime labs and using private labs can be pricey for local authorities.\n\nSome local police departments are exploring a roadside test from Switzerland, where cannabis under 1 percent THC is legal. In Florida, more sophisticated testing is coming soon to law enforcement agencies in the Sunshine State: An agriculture official told the Industrial Hemp Advisory Council that a new THC field test will cost $6.50 per test.\n\nStone said local prosecutors in South Carolina are sending samples to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, which hired additional chemists and bought additional mass spectrometry machines that each cost about $100,000.\n\nLike Texas, South Carolina hemp laws followed last year\u2019s farm bill. But unlike other states that have seen prosecutions move away from marijuana cases, South Carolina prosecutors can still move forward with the cases because there is no statute of limitations for any criminal offense in the state.\n\nIn Texas, the statute of limitations for marijuana offenses is two years. That\u2019s why prosecutors\u2019 offices are tossing cases, said Creuzot, the Dallas County district attorney. There\u2019s such a \u201ctremendous backlog\u201d at state crime labs that the suspected marijuana samples can\u2019t be tested before the statute of limitations runs up.\n\nOhio bought equipment that isn\u2019t yet online, said Klein, but it will eventually allow the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation to test suspected marijuana samples. When testing becomes available, prosecutors in the state also will have a two-year statute of limitations to contend with.\n\n\u201cIf you have a state with a statute of limitation and a time frame a case has to be prosecuted within, it\u2019s de facto legalization by basically putting those agencies in a position of not being able to prosecute the case,\u201d said Stone.\n\n\u201cWe do not have a statute of limitation. It\u2019s going to cost more money and more manpower, but it\u2019s still against the law in South Carolina and we\u2019re moving forward in the same fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to cause a delay.\u201d\n\nProponents of marijuana legalization, however, caution that a lack of enforcement does not solve the issues that legalization and regulation would address. \u201cCertain individuals will avoid prosecution, but the only way to truly end the arrest of adults for marijuana is to fully legalize it at the state level,\u201d said Erik Altieri, the executive director of NORML, an organization that advocates for marijuana legalization.\n\nCreuzot said police officers often file marijuana cases anyways, despite knowing that his office won\u2019t pursue the charges. \u201cThey arrest the person [and] take them to jail. ... I don\u2019t have any control over that if that\u2019s what they want to do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAn arrest in and of itself, even if the case is dismissed, can still have life-altering effects for somebody,\u201d said Moore, of the Drug Policy Alliance, listing the potential consequences: barriers to employment opportunities, loans for higher education, affordable housing, and family law and immigration implications. \u201cBackground checks are run by third parties. ... often there are scenarios where the data isn\u2019t updated\u201d and the arrest will still show on someone\u2019s record.\n\nAdvocates may be \u201cpleased when any adult doesn't face criminal penalties for marijuana possession,\u201d said Altieri. But \u201cthis is not a reliable \u2018get out of jail free card\u2019 that consumers can rely on.\u201d", "description": "Hemp and marijuana products both come from the same plant, cannabis, which makes it nearly impossible for the average cop to tell the difference.", "authors": ["Mona Zhang"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6b/77/ee2a35c14a1583169226cef82619/190923-mcconnell-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
