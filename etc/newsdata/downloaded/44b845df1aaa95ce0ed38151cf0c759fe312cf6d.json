But he did not address why the information about the woman\u2019s recollection was removed from the story.\n\nDao declined a POLITICO request for comment.\n\nIn the article, Pogrebin and Kelly reported that Max Stier, CEO of a Washington nonprofit, said he witnessed Kavanaugh having \u201cpushed his penis into the hand\u201d of female classmate, an incident he tried unsuccessfully to get the FBI to investigate during Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing.\n\nAfter The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway, co-author of a separate Kavanaugh book, pointed out that the woman involved in the alleged incident had not remembered it, the Times added the key detail in an editor\u2019s note stating that Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s new book \u2014 \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation\u201d \u2014 \u201creports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident.\u201d\n\nThe article prompted calls from leading Democrats, including presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro, for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment.\n\nBut the paper\u2019s handling of Kavanaugh piece has also come under widespread scrutiny, with criticism of the Times for publishing Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s new reporting in a Sunday Review essay, rather than the paper\u2019s news pages, and its promotion of the piece with a now-deleted tweet that appeared to make light of allegations against Kavanaugh.\n\nBoth liberals and conservative critics have accused the paper of bungling the story, with President Donald Trump calling Monday night for the resignation of everybody involved in \u201cthe Kavanaugh SMEAR story.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/1408/1155968404_6086855404001_6086852801001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\n\u201cWe certainly never intended to mislead in any way,\u201d Pogrebin said in discussing the editor\u2019s note on MSNBC. \u201cWe wanted to give as full a story as possible.\u201d\n\nOn MSNBC, Pogrebin said that she and Kelly named the female classmate involved in the new allegation in their book, though the Times doesn\u2019t usually include an alleged victim\u2019s name. So when Times editors removed the woman\u2019s name, they also removed the reference to her not recalling the Yale incident, according to Pogrebin.\n\nMSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell asked the reporters if anyone at the Times considered mentioning in the editor\u2019s note that the detail was in their original draft, as that \u201cwould have been clarifying for people wondering how this happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if they did or not,\u201d Kelly responded. \u201cI think the desire was just to get the information out to the reader, not to focus too much on the process. Obviously, there had been an error of judgment that was being addressed.\u201d\n\nIn a Tuesday interview on WMAL\u2019s \u201cMornings on the Mall,\u201d Pogrebin defended publishing Stier\u2019s allegation, though noted that they \u201cdid not lead\u201d with it.\n\n\u201cWe did not put a news story on the front of The New York Times saying, \u2018Another Allegation Against Kavanaugh,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cThat was our decision. That is not the thrust of our book, that there\u2019s a new allegation. That\u2019s what the takeaway is right now because no one has had the book and has seen its totality. But actually, if you see it, it\u2019s two paragraphs in an almost 300-page book. We did not make a lot of this. The world is making a lot of this.\u201d\n\nPogrebin later admitted Tuesday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d that she wrote the tweet, but said her intention was to speak to those who may \u201cminimize\u201d or \u201cdismiss\u201d the allegation fromDeborah Ramirez, Kavanaugh\u2019s second accuser, because it doesn\u2019t rise to the level of sexual assault or rape. But, she said, \u201cit had the opposite effect and it seemed to undermine her experience.\u201d\n\n", "description": "'It was just sort of. . . in the haste of the editing process.\u2019", "authors": ["Michael Calderone"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/37/60/d077c9944a188ec99f4a458ba1c3/180916-kavanaugh-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
