Thanks in no small part to the extreme conditions of the inferno, the final confirmation that their loved ones died remains up in the air.\n\nBut in an effort to remedy that situation, emergency workers have been deploying state-of-the-art, \u201crapid DNA\u201d testing tech over the last 24 hours, trying to accelerate the ID process. Mourning parents and siblings have had to provide sample swabs.\n\n\u201cRapid DNA testing refers to completely automated testing of DNA, testing samples in less than two hours using portable \u2018all-in-one\u2019 instruments,\u201d Mehul Anjaria, a Los Angeles-based forensic DNA specialist, told Fox News. \u201cEssentially, a sample such as a swab, is placed in the machine, and after two hours, a DNA profile is printed out.\n\n\"It does not require a trained DNA laboratory analysis or environment to conduct. Its portability is the key.\u201d\n\nDEADLY CALIFORNIA BOAT FIRE HAS DIVE COMMUNITY STRUGGLING FOR ANSWERS\n\nIn the predawn hours on Monda \u2013 it should have been the final day of a happy Labor Day weekend cruise in Southern California waters \u2013 the Conception erupted in flames just 20 yards from Santa Cruz Island's north shore. Five crew members above deck were able to leap from the flames. One crew member and all of the 34 passengers \u2013 who were believed to be sleeping below deck \u2013 were apparently unable to get to safety.\n\nAfter more than a day of search-and-rescue efforts, crews on Tuesday made the grim transition to search and recovery, poring over the charred remnants of the 75-foot vessel. As it stood Wednesday afternoon, it appeared that nearly all victims\u2019 remains had been located, with just one missing.\n\nBut making affirmative identifications -- and offering the victims' friends and kin some closure -- is no simple task. Thus, the fast, on-the-spot DNA process has been getting a workout.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible technology and is going to change the way law enforcement does business,\u201d said Jim Davis, a former FBI agent and chief federal officer for ANDE, a firm that's been a pioneer in the rapid DNA testing industry. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a lab on a block of plastic that uses the same basic chemistry and processing that is used in traditional labs.\u201d\n\nHe noted that in his law enforcement career, which took him to Iraq and Afghanistan, crews routinely deployed the tech to ID bombmakers and other wanted targets quickly. The U.S. military has been using it primarily since 2014, while law enforcement agencies started turning to rapid DNA in early 2016.\n\nMost recently, it has been adopted by the Department of Homeland Security to verify family links among migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Office used ANDE last year to help positively identify victims of California\u2019s wildfires so death certificates could be issued promptly.\n\n\u201cBurn victims can be very hard to identify. In these fires, we were able to go there and do testing on badly burned remains which were sometimes just given to us in shopping bags,\u201d Davis explained.\n\nHistorically, he said, the DNA process has taken weeks or even months. This was due not only to the technology used, but also to lab backlogs.\n\nThe new approach cut through the red tape.\n\nThe Justice Department has been helping local officials with the DNA process. Officials declined to comment on precisely how long the confirmation process in the boat fire will take.\n\nThe Santa Barbara County coroner has been tasked with handling the autopsies, with assistance from Sacramento and Los Angeles.\n\nInvestigators have not yet officially released the names of the victims, pending the outcome of the confirmation process, but slowly, names and tributes have been trickling out via social media.\n\nIn the immediate hours following the tragedy, the City of Santa Barbara established a Family Assistance Center and Emergency Operation Center at Earl Warren Showgrounds, where families could go for the latest information, support and grief counseling. The facility has included professional resources provided by the American Red Cross, Hospice of Santa Barbara, police and fire departments, and the Institute of Collective Trauma and Growth.\n\nA hotline has handled dozens of calls, officials stated.\n\nSusana Solano Rosas checked in on Tuesday morning, as news broke that the search effort was being called off. She's lost much of her family: Her three daughters, Angela, Nicole and Evan Quitasol, were celebrating the birthday of their dad, Michael, aboard the Conception, along with their stepmom, Fernisa Sison.\n\nAngela was a middle school science teacher, and Evan was an emergency room nurse, both in Stockton. Nicole worked at Nicky Rottens Bar & Burger Joint on San Diego\u2019s Coronado Island.\n\nAs the outpouring of grief continued, scores of companies and individuals touched by tragedy have found ways to express their pain.\n\n\u201cWe would like to extend our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the family of our former skater, Angela Rosa,\u201d said Port City Roller Girls, a Stockton-based roller derby team. \u201cOur thoughts are with her biggest fan and proud Port City supporter, her mother Susana as well as her sister Christina who also skated with us... Godspeed.\u201d\n\nLincoln Unified Teachers Association (LUTA), where Angela worked, said in a statement that it was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d and would be providing support services for fellow LUTA members.\n\nMeanwhile, a GoFundMe page was created Tuesday by those who'd worked with Nicole in Coronado, with the goal of raising $55,000 for Susana to cover the funeral costs for all five family members. Over $10,000 had been pledged in under 24 hours, as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are broken, and we can\u2019t imagine the pain her family feels,\u201d said a statement from the campaign, entitled \u201cLove & Support for The Quitasol Family.\u201d \u201cNicole will be remembered as an adventurous and loving soul.\u201d\n\nCALIFORNIA DIVE BOAT FIRE WAS 'FREAK ACCIDENT,' UNDERWATER CINEMATOGRAPHER SAYS\n\nAlso among the apparent victims: Charles McIlvain, an employee of Sony Pictures in Culver City.\n\n\u201cYou were always a good person with an awesome heart. You can always tell how amazing a person is by how much their friends care about them. I pray for you and your family. In time, they will heal because of how your amazing spirit will live on,\u201d one friend wrote. \u201cYou lived it to the fullest. For that I raise my glass to you. God bless you and your family. RIP Charles McIlvain.\u201d\n\nThe boat\u2019s cauterized skeleton now rests on the ocean floor, and an investigation was ongoing over the cause of the deadly fire. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was expected to release preliminary findings next week. A final report could take upward of two years.\n\nOver the past two days, scores of flowers, flags and candles have piled up along the harbor, marking the spot where the Conception left. Friends, family, tourists and the close-knit dive community were stopping by to pay their respects, in torment and bafflement. Many could not understand how such a disaster could have befallen Truth Aquatics, a highly regarded boat operation company headquartered in Santa Barbara.\n\nSunset vigils have been slated to take place on Thursday at the Santa Monica Aquarium and the Deep Blue Scuba Center on Long Beach\u2019s Belmont Pier, commemorating the lives of the victims.\n\n\u201cThis has impacted the community in more words than I can say. We frequent the islands and were planning to be on a (dive) trip this weekend,\u201d said Jenna Lane, a Santa Barbara-based therapist who visited the growing memorial this week with her fianc\u00e9, a master diver. \u201cI\u2019m horrified at what transpired and completely heartbroken. Our hearts are going out to all those who are suffering.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "As the clock ticks on in the aftermath of California\u2019s scuba boat tragedy, friends and family members of those believed to have perished on-board are left languishing in limbo.
