The voter abuse, it\u2019s a disgrace what\u2019s happening in California.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to say:\n\nIn everything I do, I never forget that I am not president of the world, I am president of the United States of America. We reject globalism and we embrace patriotism. We believe that every American citizen, no matter their background, deserves a government that is loyal to them. The Democrat Party and the radical Left are trying to abolish the distinction between citizens and non-citizens. In many cases, people that come into our country illegally \u2026 they were treated better than our Vets \u2026 not anymore.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, voter fraud is widespread across states like California, Texas, and Florida, according to experts. In Texas, for example, there are roughly 95,000 noncitizens on the voter rolls.\n\nLikewise, in California, expert Eric Eggers has detailed how the state\u2019s enormous illegal alien population is likely being facilitated to vote through the state\u2019s ballot harvesting policy.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
