The End.\n\nOf course, lawmakers didn\u2019t eat up and this interminable story isn\u2019t over. Saturday\u2019s parliamentary session instead served up another helping of thin gruel to those British voters who just want the whole thing resolved. Rather than the prime minister getting a vote on his 11th-hour agreement with Brussels, one he may possibly have won, he could only watch as lawmakers passed an amendment giving them more time to scrutinize the deal before passing it.\n\nJohnson might yet win the day; he\u2019s planning another push on Monday to get Parliament to sign off on the principle of his EU agreement. Yet one can hardly begrudge the House of Commons for wanting a closer look at legislation that will inflict such profound and historic changes on the U.K.\n\nThere was a danger that if Johnson\u2019s deal had passed but the followup legislation was rejected, a no-deal Brexit would have happened by default on Halloween. Taking that unhappy prospect off the table would be a noble and useful thing in itself.\n\nThe amendment from the independent, formerly Conservative, lawmaker Oliver Letwin said the Johnson deal could be approved only if the implementing legislation \u2014 called the Withdrawal Agreement Bill \u2014 passes too. Letwin supports the Johnson deal and wasn\u2019t trying to derail it (even if many of the amendment\u2019s backers were); but given this government\u2019s willingness to gamble with a no-deal exit, and the fact that a number of Conservative MPs would be happy with that outcome, he wasn\u2019t taking any chances.\n\nWhile implementing legislation usually takes between 10 and 40 days, it might be done more quickly this time if there\u2019s political support. It will also need agreement from the House of Lords, where the government doesn\u2019t control the timetable. Johnson said he would press on with a potential \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on Monday and it\u2019s possible the Withdrawal Agreement Bill could be introduced as early as Tuesday. But it will be up to the House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, who has so often spoiled the government\u2019s attempts to force through Brexit, to rule on what\u2019s permissible.\n\nSaturday\u2019s setback certainly doesn\u2019t kill Johnson\u2019s deal. It had much more support than his predecessor Theresa May\u2019s attempt, and more than the alternative options of a no-deal Brexit, revoking Brexit altogether or a second referendum. It also, crucially, has momentum.\n\nJohnson\u2019s gamble was that enough lawmakers could be shooed onto the bandwagon Saturday before the real forensics began. That this didn\u2019t happen is in large part because his slash-and-burn strategy \u2014 where he first threatened a no-deal exit and then offered once unthinkable concessions to Brussels to get a deal over the line \u2014 has also undermined trust. The deal conjured success by pulling the rug out from under Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, a key Conservative ally.\n\nWhereas Johnson, May and many Tory Brexiters had sworn never to support an arrangement that put a customs border between the U.K. mainland and Northern Ireland, the new deal effectively does that. The DUP are furious about something that ties Northern Ireland closer to the EU and separates it from the rest of the U.K., an affront that was made worse by the party\u2019s failure to secure a veto on the new arrangements.\n\nIf Johnson had kept the support of the DUP, the Letwin amendment wouldn\u2019t have passed on Saturday, and he will no doubt be seeking ways to bring Arlene Foster\u2019s party back into the tent.\n\nWhile Johnson vowed after Saturday\u2019s defeat not to \u201cnegotiate\u201d an extension with the EU, the Benn Act (named after the Labour MP who introduced it) requires the prime minister to seek a three-month extension by Oct. 19 whether he wants to or not. On Saturday night, Johnson apparently sent a photocopy of the legally required extension letter but did not sign it, along with a separate signed warning that a delay would be a mistake. Most indications are that the EU will almost certainly grant an extension rather than see the U.K. leave with no deal.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There was very nearly a bedtime Brexit tale that went something like this: And so, finally, the porridge was just right, Parliament ate up Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal and then, satisfied, went to bed.
