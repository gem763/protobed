You need time to recover the time you lose,\u201d Pochettino added.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where we are. Maybe our performances are good but you need this extra, which is mental, connection. It\u2019s energy to be together, not to have different agendas in the squad.\u201d\n\nTottenham host Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday and Pochettino said his players had to stay calm to get back to winning ways.\n\n\u201cWe are in a period where it\u2019s a bit tough for us but we keep working to find a solution,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen this type of thing happens it\u2019s about staying clear, fresh and calm. We\u2019re trying to find solutions and we only need time.\u201d", "description": "Tottenham Hotspur's unsettled squad must make up for time lost in pre-season and build togetherness to arrest a slump in form, manager Mauricio Pochettino said after the London side crashed out of the League Cup on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433672914&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0H5", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
