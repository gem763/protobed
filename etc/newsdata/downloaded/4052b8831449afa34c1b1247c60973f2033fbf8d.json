If he loses, he won\u2019t just quietly resume his carefree snowbird lifestyle, albeit with millions of new Twitter followers. He\u2019ll be dogged by big legal bills as he fends off criminal investigations in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nBut what if he wins?\n\nThe election is more than a year away, his possible impeachment over the widening Ukraine scandal is far from resolved, and, yes, numerous polls show the president trailing nearly all of his likely Democratic opponents. But impatient politicos are already gaming out a scenario that is hardening into conventional wisdom: Trump is impeached by the House, acquitted by the Senate and re-elected on November 3.\n\nThe prospect of four more years has already captured the fevered imaginations of Democrats and never-Trump Republicans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi predicted, \u201cThe reelection of Donald Trump would do irreparable damage to the United States.\u201d Even the president\u2019s own supporters envision an emboldened incumbent who pulverizes political norms with a vigor, to borrow the president\u2019s go-to line, the likes of which the world has never seen.\n\nImpatient politicos are already gaming out a scenario: Trump is impeached by the House, acquitted by the Senate and re-elected on November 3.\n\nTrump himself isn\u2019t saying much about what a second term would really look like. Scripted legislative agendas are not how he rolls. Still, if his first term has taught us anything, Trump as a lame duck would be anything but unifying. Indeed, the civil war that the president has predicted could well be visible in the hostile crowds hectoring each other on the Mall in January. After that? What does a bruised but unbowed Trump do with his political capital? What does an enraged Democratic opposition bring to bear that it hasn\u2019t already?\n\nThere\u2019s only one way to answer these questions: the POLITICO Time Machine.\n\nFor the uninitiated, we used it once before in April 2016, when Trump wasn\u2019t even the Republican nominee yet and when most people insisted he still had no chance of winning the White House. But our band of armchair time travelers already foresaw the looming possibility that the unorthodox novice could well be impeached if he ever took office. Our prognosticators weren\u2019t so far off, given how fast Democrats started investigating Trump once they took the House majority halfway through his first term.\n\nOK, sure, we were a little wide of the mark in predicting Trump would reopen Alcatraz and the World War II-era internment camps to house suspected Islamic extremists. And back in early 2016, no one saw Russia, much less Ukraine, emerging as the centerpiece of the impeachment inquiry. But, boy, did our brain trust nail it on predictions about Trump skirting Congress to pay for his border wall; a full-blown civil war brewing inside the intelligence community; and presidential approval numbers collapsing faster than a Greenland glacier.\n\nTo further fine-tune the conventional wisdom, we reconvened the Time Machine travelers and added a bunch more to the roster \u2014 25 people who know Trump world and GOP and Democratic politics \u2014 and asked them: What\u2019s in store for Washington and the nation if Trump defies the odds to hold onto the White House?\n\n\u201cWe will have entered an era of authoritarianism,\u201d warned John Dean, the former Richard Nixon White House lawyer whose public testimony about Watergate helped lead to the president\u2019s resignation.\n\nThat\u2019s just left-wing hysteria, said Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House and outspoken Trump ally. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think Trump will be emboldened. I think Trump will be Trump. I think Trump is emboldened every morning. He goes, \u2018I\u2019m a billionaire. I\u2019ve got the White House, Air Force One and Marine One. And I\u2019m commander in chief. What\u2019s part two?\u2019 All these guys who spent three years shooting at me and I\u2019m still in the building and they\u2019re not.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut even some Trump supporters foresee the chance that Trump might test the boundaries of presidential power with bad results.\n\nFormer George W. Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, a card-carrying establishment Republican who once criticized the president but now largely supports him, said a reelected Trump has the potential to take things too far. \u201cI think it\u2019d be very much like the first term with the risky exception that having survived impeachment and having been elected by the people he might feel like the guard rails are even farther away from the road he travels. I\u2019d hope he\u2019d realizes the guardrails are there for a good purpose and if he drives too fast [he\u2019ll] crash through them.\u201d\n\nEven some Trump supporters foresee the chance that Trump might test the boundaries of presidential power with bad results.\n\nAt a Rose Garden press conference in early 1999 after the Senate acquitted him, President Bill Clinton responded to a question about whether he could \u201cforgive and forget\u201d by saying, \u201cI believe any person who asks forgiveness has to be prepared to give it.\u201d According to Bob Woodward\u2019s account in his book, Shadow, a reporter then shouted to the president as he was walking away asking whether he\u2019d be vindictive toward the Republicans who\u2019d just impeached him. Clinton didn\u2019t turn around.\n\nTrump \u201cwon\u2019t keep walking,\u201d Fleischer predicted. \u201cHe\u2019ll run back to the mic.\u201d\n\nSo what would Trump say? We\u2019ll let the Time Machine do the talking.\n\n***\n\nThe time is January 2021. The election has left the nation a psychological mess and a sulfurous cloud of election meddling by foreign hackers hangs over the still-contested results. Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal ultimately spared him but it wounded Joe Biden enough to give Elizabeth Warren the nomination. Once again, though, the result came down to the Electoral College, but even closer than in 2016. Warren, like Hillary Clinton four years earlier, took the popular vote by a resounding margin. But this mixed verdict has done nothing but further entrench the battle lines of a civil war that has become more than just a metaphor.\n\nThe weeks after Election Day were ugly. Protests in New York, Washington, San Francisco and a dozen other cities turned violent, the byproduct of a tangled mass of disgruntled pink-hatted Democrats, MAGA supporters, left-wing antifa and far-right Proud Boys. People have been killed. The president chalked up the discord to urban blight. And then he imposed curfews and directed the National Guard to patrol the streets over the protests of governors and mayors.\n\nOn January 20, Trump takes the oath of office, vowing in the shadow of the Capitol for the second time that he would \u201cto the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d The scene is unlike anything before in the country\u2019s history. What\u2019s always been a high-security event takes on a militaristic tone, with Trump ordering U.S. troops onto the streets of Washington as a show of force to deter more riots. His family surrounds him, along with a loyal base of congressional Republicans who but for a few defectors hung on during his first four years and most notably voted to keep him in office and defeat impeachment. Democrats, still seething at Trump\u2019s flagrant constitutional violations, boycott the event en masse, the first time in modern history this has happened. Their seats are given away in a lottery open to Trump supporters.\n\nThe president chalked up the discord to urban blight. And then he imposed curfews and directed the National Guard to patrol the streets over the protests of governors and mayors.\n\nSomething else is notable, too. The four living ex-presidents, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter join George W. Bush in a protocol-busting protest. They skip Trump\u2019s inaugural ceremony and accept Carter\u2019s invitation to hand out meals at a Washington, D.C., homeless shelter.\n\nAfter the inaugural parade, which includes tanks for the first time in a half-century, the president goes into the White House, takes out a hand-written enemies list of people who work for him and makes Jared Kushner fire everyone on it. The casualty list includes Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. Mike Pompeo and Mark Esper resigned before the election, having been blamed by Trump for the Ukraine mess. Steve Mnuchin is the only original Cabinet secretary still in Trump\u2019s good graces.\n\nA new crop of loyalists gets hired, including now-former Reps. Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan and Doug Collins, as well as Lindsey Graham, who steps down from the Senate to become the new Defense secretary. Brad Parscale moves from campaign manager to serve as White House chief of staff \u2014 but only after Trump leaves Mick Mulvaney\u2019s former job open for six months. Trump promises his longtime adviser Stephen Miller an appointment to run the Homeland Security Department in an acting capacity during the close of the second term, when Senate confirmation won\u2019t matter for a lame duck administration. And the president also raids his reelection campaign for new staff, believing they will be more loyal than the Frankenstein crew from the Republican National Committee that he hastily assembled in 2017.\n\nThe four living ex-presidents skip Trump's inaugural ceremony and hand out meals at a Washington, D.C., homeless shelter.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t work to reelect a man you hate to get into the White House,\u201d observes Michael Caputo, a longtime Trump adviser who agreed to join us on our time traveling experiment and says the 2020 campaign represents a real bounty for faithful, Trump-believing worker bees.\n\nNext comes the score settling. \u201cTrump totally unburdened and 100 percent politics all the time. Payback is hell,\u201d predicted one of the Republicans close to the White House who insisted on anonymity because of their current job.\n\nAs Washington freezes through the end of winter, Trump moves his administration temporarily to Mar-a-Lago. He\u2019s golfing six days a week with the likes of celebrity admirers Rush Limbaugh, Kid Rock and Tiger Woods but finds time between rounds to lob Twitter grenades at anyone who crossed him during his first four years in office. Republicans are not spared as Trump draws a bull\u2019s-eye on the half-dozen senators who voted to convict him at the impeachment trial. He hounds Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to remove Ben Sasse from the Banking, Judiciary and Intelligence committees. He scouts out 2022 GOP primary challengers for Richard Burr and Lisa Murkowski. And he seethes that he doesn\u2019t have more ways to deliver payback to Susan Collins or a certain Mormon senator from Utah.\n\n\u201cRomney is lucky he\u2019s running for reelection in 2024,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, another former Trump campaign aide from 2016 who is riding shotgun in our time machine and sees an election cycle four years into the future as far enough away to spare the 2012 GOP presidential nominee from Trump\u2019s ultimate payback.\n\nRepublicans are not spared as Trump draws a bull's-eye on the half-dozen senators who voted to convict him at the impeachment trial.\n\nTrump keeps trying to goose his government into action as the summer of 2021 arrives. He\u2019s starting to sweat the U.S. economy in the months after the long-anticipated recession became official that April with the second consecutive quarter of negative growth. He tweets 10 times a day about how Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell is responsible. He gives one of his remaining first-term holdovers, national economic adviser Larry Kudlow, one more chance to pitch a middle-class tax cut in the hope that can turn things around.\n\nTrump also leans in harder on his Justice Department. First, he orders Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s name removed from the building headquarters in Washington and replaces it with Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and personal lawyer to the president whom Trump has installed as the director of his revamped and celebratory Voice of America. Then Trump threatens to fire Attorney General William Barr and every U.S. attorney in the country if criminal charges are not filed by Thanksgiving against any holdovers from the Obama administration who had a role in the original 2016 Russia investigation.\n\nTrump cancels the annual turkey pardoning event and replaces it with a ceremony to give the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn and Roger Stone. All three former 2016 campaign aides had been sentenced to jail for crimes tied to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe, but Trump thinks he\u2019s got room to maneuver now that he\u2019s safely in a second term and decides to wipe their records clean.\n\nConfounded and depressed by the 2020 election results, Democrats can\u2019t figure out how to respond to every new example of Trump defying Congress. \u201cThe infighting. The blaming. The everything. Whoo!\u201d Democratic operative James Carville says of his party\u2019s struggle to find itself after losing in 2020. Jim Manley, a longtime aide to Harry Reid who was with us back in 2016 the last time we zoomed off into the future, foresees a \u201ccircular firing squad\u201d taking place in his party \u201cwith no national Democratic leader able to tamp down on the internecine warfare.\u201d\n\nDemocrats can\u2019t figure out how to respond to every new example of Trump defying Congress.\n\nIn the House, Pelosi was a goner the moment the television networks back in November declared Trump the winner. The president had taunted her throughout the 2020 campaign for her leadership against him on impeachment. And while her party still clings to a narrow House majority, the San Francisco congresswoman decides to call it quits and hands the speaker\u2019s gavel over to Hakeem Jeffries, a 50-year old lawmaker from a Brooklyn-Queens district that is a stone\u2019s throw from the president\u2019s childhood home.\n\nDemocrats still have subpoena power, but they\u2019ve been neutered by repeated attempts to draw anything out of the president. In the summer before the 2020 presidential election, the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority rendered Trump virtually impregnable with a 5-4 decision overturning its seminal Watergate ruling against Richard Nixon and instead embracing a broad range of presidential executive powers.\n\nThe focus for House lawmakers shifts from Trump\u2019s alleged abuses of power and foreign meddling in U.S. elections to something that doesn\u2019t quite pique Trump\u2019s ire as much: neglect at the federal agencies across his administration. While the Constitution has no double jeopardy clause for impeachment, Democrats debate whether to hold their fire in even considering another attempt at removing him from office.\n\nIn the House, Pelosi was a goner the moment the television networks back in November declared Trump the winner.\n\nSure, there\u2019s all manner of agitation to try again \u2014 namely from the crop of freshman and sophomore Democrats who now hold the largest bloc of votes in the House conference. But Jeffries cuts that talk off by the summer of 2021, saying the party won\u2019t consider another impeachment until after the 2022 midterms \u2014 and only if there\u2019s a blue wave that causes dramatic shifts in the Senate. He argues there\u2019s no point going to war again with a president who won\u2019t stop talking about his new mandate or with Republicans who wouldn\u2019t convict the president in the first term even after being presented with a \u201csmoking gun\u201d audio tape that was secretly stashed on an internal White House server of Trump offering to sell Alaska to Vladimir Putin in exchange for Russian hackers\u2019 help to win a second term.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s now free to do everything he wants, even if it\u2019s clearly an impeachable offense because they\u2019re not going to go after him two times in a row,\u201d laments former Connecticut Rep. Chris Shays, one of four Republicans who voted against all four articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton in 1998.\n\nWith impeachment off the table, Trump tries to cut deals with a divided Congress. But he spends his political capital much faster than his aides want. He finally gets a win on a replacement for the North American trade agreement that he tore up in his first term. But that\u2019s it. House Democrats balk at an infrastructure package. There\u2019s nowhere close to the 60 Senate votes needed to overhaul the nation\u2019s prescription drug laws. The resulting bickering and blaming among lawmakers kills the chances for even bigger lifts. Reforming entitlement programs is nixed during the debate over Trump\u2019s first budget in his second term. A comprehensive immigration overhaul gets shelved in the aftermath of Mexican troops accidentally opening fire on their American counterparts outside El Paso, the resulting tensions stoked by Trump and conservative media warnings about a caravan of thousands of migrants that never materializes at the border.\n\nAs we travel further into Trump\u2019s second term, we see that he doesn\u2019t lose every battle in the Capitol. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, reelected in 2020 to a seventh term, continues to do his part to remake the federal courts. The Kentucky Republican clears the floor calendar to hold votes confirming more than 100 more new judges with lifetime appointments to the district and appellate circuits, and conservatives rejoice at the prospect of friendly decisions for decades to come on issues like abortion, religion, and environmental and labor policy.\n\nWith impeachment off the table, Trump tries to cut deals with a divided Congress \u2014 but spends his political capital much faster than his aides want.\n\nOn the Supreme Court, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, two associate justices in their mid-70s at the time of Trump\u2019s second inaugural, opt for retirement rather than risk being replaced by a Democratic president after 2025. Meanwhile, the two remaining Bill Clinton-appointed justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, maximize their cardiovascular workouts and adopt strict Mediterranean diets.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t really alter his erratic, isolationist foreign policy instincts. He withdraws all U.S. troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, despite reservations even among Republicans. In Syria, ISIS has proclaimed a second modern-day Caliphate. He threatens repeatedly to pull the U.S. out of NATO, even ordering that the paperwork be drawn up but backs down as Republicans and Democrats unite to throw legislative hurdles in his way. He saber rattles on tariffs with China for all four additional years, but never closes a trade deal with Beijing; by the end of his second term, the U.S. and China have had near-skirmishes in the increasingly militarized South China Sea. Jared Kushner never actually releases the second half of his Middle East peace plan. The Iran nuclear deal collapses entirely, although Tehran doesn't immediately restart its nuclear program as it tries to rebuild its economy. Luckily, for the Iranians, China and Russia increasingly are willing to ignore U.S. sanctions and give them a financial lifeline. There also is no breakthrough on nuclear weapon talks with North Korea, though Kim Jong Un makes his first visit to the United States and joins Trump and Dennis Rodman courtside at the United Center for a Chicago Bulls game.\n\nHe threatens repeatedly to pull the U.S. out of NATO but backs down as Republicans and Democrats unite to throw legislative hurdles in his way.\n\nTrump also spends his time thinking about his legacy, and whom he wants to replace him in the White House. After dropping hints in private for months, he finally sends out a tweet on July 4, 2022, that he doesn\u2019t support Mike Pence\u2019s presidential ambitions. \u201cGreat guy, TREMENDOUS veep, but it\u2019s time for some Beautiful NEW BLOOD,\u201d he writes. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul back out by Labor Day, and the field is cleared for Ivanka Trump to take the party\u2019s nomination 17 months before anyone has participated in a caucus or primary.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump takes direct control over planning for his presidential library, which in a break with tradition will include no actual presidential papers because there are none that have been preserved. He strong arms the General Services Administration to write through the lease agreement on his D.C. hotel and tells Congress he won\u2019t consent to end a months-long government shutdown unless it amends a century-old law restricting height limits on buildings in the Capitol. When the standoff ends, construction begins immediately on a new 75-story addition to the historic building that when finished will look down on the Washington Monument and the rest of the city.\n\nSome of our fellow time travelers aren\u2019t entirely certain that second-term Trump will be distinguishable from first-term Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s a category 5 tornado now,\u201d insisted Ty Cobb, the former Trump White House lawyer who managed the president\u2019s response to the Robert Mueller investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to break the measuring point.\u201d\n\nTrump himself has acknowledged how a state of perpetual scandal has reset all the meters. \u201cIt's almost become, like, a part of my day,\u201d the president told reporters earlier this month when talking about all his interactions with lawyers.\n\nThe question is whether his opponents will finally resign themselves to his existence and find ways to adapt to his style of chaotic governance.\n\n\u201cThis has been a war every single day since the day he won. My presumption here is that is not sustainable if he gets elected [again]. At that point it\u2019s just too difficult to sustain,\u201d says Gingrich. Indeed, he says he can envision a bloc of around 50 House Democrats who will eventually come around to working with a second-term Trump on issues like infrastructure or join him in a big health care push on sickle cell anemia research.\n\n\u201cOnce they get past having to chant \u2018We hate Trump!\u2019 and \u2018Impeach Trump!\u2019, which I think will disappear if he wins reelection because it\u2019s not sustainable emotionally, then there\u2019s a real opportunity to put together a series of bipartisan majorities,\u201d said Gingrich, who now lives in Rome with his wife, Callista, the U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.\n\nSome of our fellow time travelers aren\u2019t entirely certain that second-term Trump will be distinguishable from first-term Trump.\n\nThat was, after all, the case with Clinton, who stayed busy in his final two years after his Senate trial, signing more than a dozen big laws, including a major banking deregulation plan later blamed for sparking the subprime mortgage financial crisis.\n\n\u201cWe went back to work,\u201d Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader during the 1999 impeachment trial, said in an interview. \u201cIt was a different time, different people, different media, quite frankly.\u201d\n\nWhile our time machine travels did not envision more impeachments in Trump\u2019s future beyond what\u2019s coming today in his first term, anyone watching the current battles can\u2019t help but acknowledge the ever-present possibility that he could get pulled through the process again. Doug Holtz-Eakin, who in 2008 worked as a top adviser to John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign, said he would see \u201clittle upside\u201d for Democrats to keep trying to impeach a second-term Trump.\n\nBut he wouldn\u2019t rule it out entirely, either. \u201cThe only way I could imagine a second impeachment would be if there was a clear, serious violation of national security laws,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are those who clearly will never adjust to Trump, and who see the president serving four more years as a real threat to the country\u2019s constitutional balance.\n\n\u201cAs someone who has been in this business for more than 50 years in Washington, I cannot tell you how troubled I am by these prospects that the entire structure of the government system that\u2019s operated for my lifetime and probably for a century before seems to be crumbling,\u201d said Philip Allen Lacovara, a former Watergate prosecutor who made the winning argument in that unanimous 1974 Supreme Court case that helped lead to Nixon\u2019s resignation.\n\n\u201cThe very fact that people in the executive branch figure that they can simply put a thumb in the eye of Congress when they\u2019re asked for information day after day after day after day, not on particularly controversial or sensitive single subject inquiries, that really is changing the fundamental nature of the government,\u201d Lacovara added. \u201cAnd the typical voter who is concerned about other things is simply not aware of this. And if Trump gets another four years to codify, institutionalize and embed this attitude it\u2019s going to be very hard for Congress to reassert any effective control and oversight. I think that\u2019s the real risk.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s critics also worry that, given four more years in office, the president's unconventional ways could have other long-lasting effects on society. \u201cYoung people will grow up thinking that\u2019s the way politics is,\u201d said Shays. \u201cSo many of the things our Founding Fathers believe in will just go out the window.\u201d\n\nTo Trump supporters, including the ones who came along on our time machine ride, all the talk about the end of democracy sounds laughable. \u201cWe said the same thing in 2012. \u2018The stakes are just so high,\u2019\u201d Nunberg said of the fears surrounding a second Obama term. \u201cWe were fine.\u201d\n\nAmerica, Trump\u2019s supporters argue, is much more durable than the president\u2019s critics acknowledge \u2014 even if he wins two terms. \u201cIt drives me crazy,\u201d Fleischer said, \u201cwhen people think Donald Trump\u2019s tweets somehow are stronger than James Madison\u2019s handwriting.\u201d", "description": "He survives impeachment and he surprises at the polls.
