Week 7 offers up juicy matchups and we are here to help you make money off of them. USA TODAY\n\nThe three disciples have gone their separate ways, and the teacher has retired.\n\nBut when Mike Shanahan watches Kyle Shanahan, Sean McVay and Matt LaFleur establish themselves in the NFL, he smiles.\n\n\u201cIt actually is fun,\u201d the two-time Super Bowl-winning head coach told USA TODAY Sports in a recent telephone interview. \u201cYou can call the formations, call the plays, you can call the blocking schemes. They all have a different game plan for each opponent. Each guy has different things to add to the offense, building on what they\u2019ve learned. So that\u2019s also fun to watch.\u201d\n\nWhen he hired the trio as members of his staff in Washington in 2010, Shanahan raised some eyebrows. Although his son had started to develop a reputation as a bright offensive mind during his time in Houston, LaFleur (hired to serve as Washington\u2019s quarterbacks coach) and McVay (initially an assistant tight ends coach and then elevated to tight ends coach) were unknowns.\n\nMike Shanahan, in 2013 when he was head coach of the Redskins.

Rams are trying to get back to the Super Bowl after losing to New England last winter. Kyle Shanahan, also in his third season, has the San Francisco 49ers off to a 5-0 start (remaining perfect after a 20-7 victory over McVay\u2019s Rams last Sunday). LaFleur, in his first season as a head coach, has Green Bay at 5-1.\n\nSaid Mike Shanahan, \u201cYou go to different organizations and everyone has different strengths and weaknesses and you\u2019ve got to find a way to build it and give yourself a chance to win consistently. I think all three have a really good background in that: understanding how to turn an organization around, having been around some good situations, some tough situations. ... They\u2019re all in football organizations that will give them a chance to do the little things the right way.\u201d\n\nEach young coach\u2019s journey has unfolded differently: McVay with a rapid turnaround; Kyle Shanahan with a gradual build; LaFleur inheriting a team in win-now mode. However, all three are following the same blueprint to success, Mike Shanahan points out.\n\nINSTANT IMPACT: If Chiefs lose Mahomes, go ahead and put Pats back in Super Bowl\n\nEach approaches his job with a strong emphasis on attention to detail, accountability, strong communication so everyone from top to bottom is on the same page and maintaining a standard of excellence.\n\nAll three are offensive coaches, as was their mentor, but they understand that the other side of the ball can\u2019t be addressed haphazardly.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you do is, you have to have a great defense to win a Super Bowl, and we all know that,\u201d the two-time Super Bowl-winning coach insisted.\n\nMcVay\u2019s first move was to hire Wade Phillips, regarded as one of the game\u2019s great defensive minds for the better part of the last three decades. Kyle Shanahan tabbed former Houston coworker Robert Saleh as his defensive coordinator and devoted high draft picks to fortifying that unit. LaFleur retained Mike Pettine as his defensive coordinator, and the Packers worked aggressively this offseason to upgrade that unit.\n\nThe third key involves constructing offenses that feature strong rushing attacks.\n\nIt\u2019s a passing league, yes. But all three coaches strive for balance because a feeble run game diminishes the passing attack in Mike Shanahan\u2019s book.\n\n\u201cTo be able to move the ball consistently, you have to believe in the running game, and everybody has to believe in it,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd the one thing that all three of them do is the play-action game and the running game look exactly the same. People will not be able to tell when they\u2019re running the ball or throwing play-action off of it, and that gives them the opportunity to get big plays throughout the game. All three guys have that foundation. When you look at their systems, there\u2019s a lot of different personnel groupings, a lot of different ways to do things, but the running game and the play-action game go hand-in-hand. You can do tight splits and wide splits and both systems will come up with big plays.\u201d\n\nINSULTING: Demaryius Thomas wasn't a fan of trade from Pats to Jets\n\nWEEK 7 PICKS: Our experts pick this week's winners\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that Goff and the Rams have faltered, losing three in a row while struggling in the rushing department. They managed just 28 yards on the ground against Tampa Bay, 82 the following week against Seattle and then had to go without Todd Gurley against San Francisco.\n\nFor much of this season and last postseason, Gurley has not been the same potent back he usually is. An arthritic knee has diminished his explosiveness, causing the Rams' coaches to use him more sparingly, hoping to preserve him for the long haul. He's averaging 4.2 yards a carry (down from 4.9 last season) and only 4.9 yards a reception (down from 9.8 last year). And last Sunday, a quad injury kept him from playing.\n\nAs a result, the Rams\u2019 offense has lacked the same balance, unpredictability and potency. However, Shanahan believes McVay will figure out how to get his team back on track.\n\n\u201cSean runs a system that\u2019s perfect for the personnel he has,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t have that personnel, he\u2019s going to adjust that system to fit the personnel. That\u2019s how Sean is.\u201d\n\nAnd for the long-term, Shanahan predicts continued success for all three former assistants. He saw these principles produce multiple Super Bowls during his days as an assistant in San Francisco and implemented them as a head coach in Denver. And because he knows the men, and the blueprint they\u2019re following, Shanahan is betting on similar results for Kyle Shanahan, McVay and LaFleur.\n\n\u201cI will not be surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople enjoy watching them for years to come.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports\u2019 Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones and listen to the Football Jones podcast on iTunes.", "description": "As three of his former assistants establish themselves in the NFL head coaching ranks, Mike Shanahan breaks down their keys to success.", "authors": ["Mike Jones", "Published A.M.
