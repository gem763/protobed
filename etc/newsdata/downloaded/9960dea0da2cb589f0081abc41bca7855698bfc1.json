However, when we suspect non-compliance Austrac will take action to protect the Australian community.\"\n\nAccording to Austrac, the outcomes of the audit -- which will be at PayPal's financial expense -- will assist PayPal with its compliance, but the regulator said it will also inform whether any further regulatory action is required.\n\nFor 2018, the company's Australian operations produced AU$9.5 million in after-tax profit, with the \"rendering of services\" seeing PayPal produce AU$594 million in revenue.\n\nThe company earns transaction fees from processing transactions for customers. Revenue resulting from a payment processing transaction is recognised once the transaction is complete, PayPal explained in its financial results.\n\nIt listed AU$534 million of its AU$594 million revenue as the total cost involved in providing such services for the year.\n\nGlobally, PayPal reported revenue of $15.45 billion for 2018.\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nCommonwealth Bank and Austrac reach AU$700m agreement over anti-money laundering breaches\n\nCBA will pay the largest civil penalty in Australian corporate history after previously laying blame on a coding error and disparate data.\n\nAustrac trialling blockchain to automate funds transfer instructions\n\nThe proof of concept is testing the feasibility of using blockchain to help entities such as banks, remitters, and casinos, automate international fund transfer instructions reporting.\n\nAustrac looks to extend Human Services data-matching project to law enforcement\n\nDespite 'robo-debt' plaguing the Department of Human Services for the majority of 2017, Austrac is looking to extend the data-matching project to Australian law-enforcement entities.", "description": "An external audit will look into the company's local operations and its compliance with financial crime laws.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/23/1626dcf1-9359-4194-9388-12e9aaecb9a6/thumbnail/770x578/43d81cc69fbb6268bef836f26be3dffc/money.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
