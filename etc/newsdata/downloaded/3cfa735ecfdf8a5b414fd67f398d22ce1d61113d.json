Within these sections Dr Tlaleng covers a wide range of topics from vaginal cleaning, to puberty, to anatomy lessons and sexual consent.\n\nIn the book Dr Tlaleng shares her view that women\u2019s sexuality and sexual health is underrepresented in the field of medicine, so in her contribution to literature she also includes a few pictures and graphics but cautions they are not \u201cjuicy\u201d because it\u2019s not \u201cTHAT kind of book\u201d.\n\nOne of the most curious topics in the book, which is also rather topical, is the matter of consent.\n\nREAD MORE: 8 embarrassing diet side effects we really need to start talking about now\n\nDr Tlaleng says often people who we look to for information are themselves deficient, so she breaks down questions to ask yourself that may help you gauge consent. She gives the following account:\n\n\u201cPeople will come [to see me] and say \u2018I have a problem, I don\u2019t have an orgasm\u2019. Couples would come also and say \u2018we\u2019re having trouble, we want to have a child but we can\u2019t have sex\u2019. Often people think you\u2019re going to do tests, but the discussion is very important because you need to understand what\u2019s happening in relationships, what\u2019s happening with individuals that they are not having fulfilled sexual experiences.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 most common questions women ask about their sexual health\n\n\u201cThe question I ask women a lot is: are you having sex when you want to have sex? Who decides when you are having sex? It\u2019s often an erection that decides that it\u2019s time for sex. Then I ask them, let\u2019s say you do want to have sex, who decides how you\u2019re going to have sex? And then during sex, how does your partner know that this is the right move? Is there feedback?\n\n\u201cThen the other question is, when does it end? It ends with an ejaculation. So sex starts with an erection and ends with an ejaculation,\u201d says Dr Tlaleng.\n\nShe adds: \u201cSo talk about what is it that you want. Because we think consent is a matter of do you want to have sex, yes or no. That is part of consent, the ongoing conversation is part of consent.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: The world\u2019s first consent condom requires four hands otherwise it won\u2019t open\n\nShe says some people think consent is boring and that it will disturb foreplay but ocnsent is \u201cthe constant affirmation that I want to be here, I\u2019m wanted and this feels good \u2013 continue\u201d.\n\nPaying close attention to your body and how it responds in certain circumstances can be hugely beneficial to answer questions around consent and overall sexual health.\n\nDr Tlaleng urges us to know our \u201cown normal\u201d by \u2013 for example \u2013 doing our own breast exams and doing self vulva checks. \u201cLook at the skin, look at the hair distribution, look if there are any lumps or bumps that you\u2019re not sure of\u2026 That\u2019s how you learn to be in tune with your body, look and pay attention,\u201d she says.\n\nShe adds that sexual health is not about having sex all the time but it is about being affirmed.\n\nSign up to W24\u2019s newsletters so you don't miss out on any of our stories and giveaways.", "description": "A book from a medical doctor, acclaimed columnist and health activist, do yourself a favour and listen to Dr T.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9429/9b5450ec1f964d979c3f471831fb7718.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
