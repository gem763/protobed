The photo appears in the school\u2019s 2000-2001 yearbook.\n\nZita Astravas, a spokesperson for the Liberal Party of Canada, confirmed to HuffPost that Trudeau is the man in the picture.\n\nExclusive: Justin Trudeau wore brownface at 2001 \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019 party while he taught at a private school, Canada's Liberal Party admits https://t.co/j3UobfYNIF \u2014 TIME (@TIME) September 18, 2019\n\nIn a briefing Wednesday night with reporters, Trudeau said he apologizes and takes responsibility for the photo and that it was racist to pose in brownface.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed and pissed off at myself,\u201d he said, adding that the incident calls for \u201cimportant conversations\u201d with colleagues, fellow candidates and Canadian citizens. He declined to say if resignation was on the table. He also disclosed that as a high school student he once dressed in costume and makeup and sang \u201cBanana Boat Song (Day O).\u201d\n\nTrudeau apologizes for brown face photo.

Adamson reportedly said he first saw the photo in July and believed it should be released to the public.\n\nTime reported that many people at the gala dressed in costume for the dinner, but according to the yearbook\u2019s six photographs of the event, Trudeau appeared to be the only attendee to paint his skin dark.\n\nThe incident surfaced just a month before Canadians head to the polls on Oct. 21. HuffPost Canada has the latest election updates.\n\nAccording to HuffPost Canada\u2019s reporting, several Conservative candidates have had to also address past behavior that members of the Liberal Party have denounced as racist or homophobic. Andrew Scheer, leader of the Tory Party, has said that candidates who genuinely apologize for such behavior will likely be allowed to carry the party banner.\n\nWhen reporters at the briefing asked how Trudeau could \u201ccredibly\u201d denounce Tory members after his own brownface incident, the prime minister said he takes responsibility for making a \u201creal mistake in the past.\u201d\n\nTrudeau has made diversity and inclusion a prominent issue of his leadership since becoming Canada\u2019s prime minister in 2015.\n\nAt the end of his press briefing, Trudeau joked that he\u2019s been \u201cmore enthusiastic about costumes than is sometimes appropriate,\u201d referring to his trip to India last year when he wore traditional garb that was ridiculed as \u201ctoo Indian even for an Indian.\u201d\n\nJagmeet Singh, leader of Canada\u2019s New Democratic Party and the country\u2019s first visible minority federal leader, called the photo \u201creally insulting,\u201d HuffPost Canada reported.\n\nTonight is not about the Prime Minister.\n\n\n\nIt's about every young person mocked for the colour of their skin.\n\n\n\nThe child who had their turban ripped off their head.\n\n\n\nAnd those reliving intense feelings of pain & hurt from past experiences of racism.\n\n\n\nTo you, I say you are loved. \u2014 Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) September 19, 2019\n\n\u201cWe see one Mr. Trudeau in public. I\u2019ll be honest with you, he seems pretty nice, right? Very friendly. Very warm in public,\u201d Singh, who is Sikh, said at a Toronto town hall on Wednesday evening, according to HuffPost Canada. \u201cBut behind closed doors he seems like a very different Mr. Trudeau.\u201d\n\nAmerican politicians have also come under fire for previous incidents of blackface. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) apologized for \u2014 but also denied being in \u2014 a yearbook photo that was publicized earlier this year and showed one man in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan hood. Northam did not step down after the incident.", "description": "Time magazine published a photo of the Canadian prime minister in brownface at a 2001 party.
