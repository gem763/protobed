Georgina went into hospital for tests and some movement was detected, so she was told to go home.\n\nAt 42 weeks, now overdue, the baby stopped moving again. Scans could not detect a heartbeat.\n\nIn February, Georgina and Dave\u2019s daughter Rosie Melanie Joyce Squire was stillborn.\n\nShe was by this point three weeks overdue and died because her umbilical cord became wrapped around her neck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeorgina told Metro.co.uk: \u2018She was allowed to grow too big and was slowly strangled.\u2019\n\nGeorgina and Dave had no idea any complications could arise from being overdue (Picture: Georgina Hardy/Metro.co.uk)\n\nGeorgina has launched a campaign to challenge the protocol of allowing women to go beyond full term, which is around the 40 week mark.\n\nMost pregnant women are fine to go over their due date by up to two weeks which is the normal time an induction is booked.\n\nBut studies have found that when pregnancies last for 40 weeks or longer, there is an increase in the risk of stillbirth and neonatal death.\n\nThe risks are small but they are there and Georgina argues all pregnant women should be made aware of them.\n\nShe said: \u2018You get to the 38 week mark and think, \u201cI\u2019ve made it\u201d, it\u2019s just a waiting game now, waiting for the baby to be here.\n\n\u2018We never for one second thought we wouldn\u2019t have a baby at the end of it.\n\n\u2018Everyone is very aware of the risk of miscarriage at the beginning of a pregnancy, we all know that those first 12 weeks are high risk, yet no-one ever speaks about there being risks at the end of the pregnancy too.\u2019\n\nThe couple had photos taken with Rosie thanks to a charity called Remember My Baby (Picture: Georgina Hardy/Metro.co.uk)\n\nGeorgina claims that in a post-mortem meeting with her doctors following Rosie\u2019s birth, medics admitted letting her go to 42 weeks was a \u2018mistake\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018They said I should have been induced at 39 weeks but they didn\u2019t follow procedure. They said it was essentially a mistake.\n\n\u2018It would have been an emergency C-section at 39 weeks, but at the end of the day, we would now have a healthy eight month old baby.\n\n\u2018I went home and started searching online \u2013 was this something I did wrong? What should I have done differently?\n\n\u2018Then I discovered all these risks associated with going overdue. I was horrified. Not once was I told anything about the risk of stillbirth after 40 weeks.\n\n\u2018I understand they don\u2019t want to scare mums \u2013 but we are told about the 12 week mark, why aren\u2019t we warned of the post-40 week mark too?\u2019\n\nGeorgina said that not being made aware of the risks made her feel \u2018let down\u2019 by the NHS.\n\nShe said: \u2018What really really upset me is that throughout the whole of my pregnancy I was repeatedly told that because of my BMI I was \u201chigh risk\u201d.\n\n\u2018I did everything right, I did everything I was supposed to do and I brought my baby to full term.\n\n\u2018The one time I needed them to act on the fact I was \u201chigh risk\u201d they didn\u2019t do it.\u2019\n\nThe couple said midwives at Colchester Hospital\u2019s bereavement suite were amazing and allowed them to stay with Rosie for three days after her birth (Picture: Georgina Hardy/Metro.co.uk)\n\nGeorgina and Dave were given a room at Colchester Hospital\u2019s bereavement suite, which they said was incredible during the most heartbreaking time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMidwives were \u2018amazing\u2019, Georgina said, and the hospital allowed the couple to spend three days with their baby, Rosie, after she was born.\n\nShe said: \u2018It was like we had a real baby for a little while. They did all they could for us.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just a shame that service has to exist.\u2019\n\nShe said she did not hold it against those who treated her as \u2018they were following protocol\u2019 but added: \u2018I think that protocol should change.\u2019\n\nGeorgina wanted to speak out about her experience after finding out the joyful news she is pregnant once again.\n\nShe said: \u2018I think that\u2019s what has spurred me into sharing this information. This time round it feels totally different.\n\nGeorgina and Dave are expecting again and are now 15 weeks pregnant with Rosie\u2019s sibling (Picture: Georgina Hardy/Metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018It feels like we are being treated the way we should have been treated last time. I\u2019ve been told I won\u2019t ever be allowed to go past 39 weeks again.\n\n\u2018And I am questioning everything I am told. It\u2019s a shame because I don\u2019t fully trust and I know that I won\u2019t truly be worry free until we have a baby in our arms.\n\n\u2018We simply can\u2019t enjoy this pregnancy.\u2019\n\nThe couple are still waiting for a final meeting with their doctors next week where they are hoping they will find out what exactly went wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCatherine Morgan is Chief Nurse at East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Colchester Hospital.\n\nShe said: \u2018Our top priority is to provide safe, high quality, compassionate health services to the patients we care for every day at the Trust.\n\n\u2018We have carried out a full investigation into what happened after the very sad stillbirth of Miss Hardy\u2019s baby and we express our sincerest condolences to her and her family. We will be meeting with her next week to talk through the findings of that review.\n\n\u2018Patient safety and the delivery of high quality care is very important to us and we strive to continually improve, so we take any lessons learned from our investigations forward to better our services.\u2019\n\nTo support Georgina\u2019s campaign, visit her petition website here.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
