Martin de Dreuille, Grey Goose\u2019s Global Vice President, joined The Final Round on Friday to discuss the US spirits market, and why a company like Grey Goose need not worry about Instagram-famous White Claw.\n\nHard seltzer is \u2018an opportunity to recruit consumers\u2019\n\nAccording to data from Nielsen, sales of hard seltzer have skyrocketed 193% since last year. Bon & Viv recently became the first official hard seltzer of the NFL, scoring a lucrative partnership for its owner, Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD). And the ballooning popularity of White Claws has transformed the brand from a viral fad into a millennial phenomenon.\n\nA variety of White Claw Hard Seltzers are seen at the Mike's Hard Lemonade office on Monday, March 27, 2017 in Chicago.

It\u2019s definitely an opportunity to recruit consumers to vodka soda.\u201d\n\nMore than that, however, de Dreuille regards burgeoning interest in hard seltzer as a consumer trend towards \u2018premiumization.\u2019\n\n\u201cConsumers want to make sure they\u2019re buying a product that has good quality ingredients,\u201d said de Dreuille. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what Grey Goose is all about.\u201d\n\nWhy Grey Goose, USTA partnership is \u2018a natural fit\u2019\n\nFor thirteen years, Grey Goose has enjoyed a successful partnership with the United States Tennis Association: as the official vodka of the U.S. Open since 2007, de Dreuille describes the collaboration as \u201ca natural fit\u201d between \u201ctwo global icons...that come together to bring this exceptional experience\u201d to a broader audience.\n\nThat experience, of course, is the US Open\u2019s signature drink. The Honey Deuce \u2013 a cocktail-turned-tradition crafted by Grey Goose \u2013 is described by de Dreuille as \u201cwhat the mint julep is to the Kentucky Derby,\u201d and is predicted by Grey Goose to sell in historic quantities at this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cVodka is an amazing category \u2013 it\u2019s the number-one drink in the US,\u201d explains de Dreuille. \u201cOne out of three drinks is a vodka in the U.S. It\u2019s the biggest category, and Grey Goose is the biggest brand in the super-premium category in vodka. Vodka is still growing, as well.\u201d\n\nBut the threat of hard seltzer stealing consumers \u2013 and their wallets \u2013 away from traditional spirits doesn\u2019t worry de Dreuille, who expressed little interest in turning the company\u2019s attention towards the hard seltzer market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll focus for now on Goose, the original, and the flavors that we have, and inspire consumers to treat themselves with it,\u201d de Dreuille says.\n\nOlivia Balsamo is a writer and producer at Yahoo Finance.
