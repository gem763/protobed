The whistleblower complaint and the resulting investigative sprawl are making the probe harder for Trump and his White House to stamp out, with Democrats gaining new avenues to uncover damaging details that contradict Trump.\n\nAnd a president who loves to be in control is increasingly finding himself out of it, left to lob angry tweets from the White House residence or the Oval Office as he and a handful of emissaries \u2014 such as personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani \u2014 function as their own uncoordinated rapid-response operation.\n\n\u201cEvery time Rudy Giuliani says something on TV, he lays out a new path for the Democrats to follow,\u201d said Chris Lu, former deputy chief counsel for the Democratic staff of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and a former top aide to President Barack Obama.\n\nFor Trump and his administration, the widening investigation risks freezing up principals in key agencies, slowing down progress on any remaining policy initiatives and triggering caution among political players who might have been in a position to advocate for him throughout 2020.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
