When he scores it\u2019s good for him and the team. He\u2019s getting better and he helped us tonight to win this match,\u201d Emery, who sent on Guendouzi and Dani Ceballos at halftime, said.\n\n\u201cPepe is a very good player and we believe in him totally. We are very happy for him and us because he has two goals and two set-pieces which are perfect.\n\n\u201cHe is improving and tonight he has two goals, which are important for us and for him. We didn\u2019t play like we wanted but we showed good spirit. It\u2019s a good victory.\u201d\n\nArsenal skipper Hector Bellerin admitted it had been a below-par display.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of things we\u2019ve got to improve as a team. We\u2019ve got to keep the ball better, that\u2019s our trademark,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you give the ball away it doesn\u2019t mean you stop playing like that, it\u2019s in our DNA.\u201d\n\nUntil Pepe\u2019s dramatic arrival the headlines looked set to be about London-born Edwards, a player Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino once described as having a playing style similar to Argentine great Lionel Messi.\n\nThe tricky 20-year-old made only one League Cup appearance for Tottenham, however, and moved to the northern Portuguese club in the close season after a loan spell at Dutch side Excelsior.\n\nHe twisted inside two Arsenal defenders to fire his side ahead in the ninth minute \u2014 celebrating in front of the home fans. He remained lively throughout until eventually being substituted with his side still leading.", "description": "Nicolas Pepe spared Arsenal's blushes with two sublime free kicks as they claimed a last-gasp 3-2 win over Vitoria in the Europa League on Thursday having twice trailed.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444655399&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N23Z", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
