But it has been seeking new ways to grow in the face of competition from startups, including short video apps Douyin and Kuaishou.\n\nThe company, backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, launched image-sharing app Oasis on Monday. Media likened it to Facebook Inc\u2019s Instagram app as it had a similar interface and allowed users to browse, share and edit photos and videos through the app. Instagram is blocked in China.\n\nBy Wednesday, it ranked as one of the top free apps on Apple Inc\u2019s Chinese App Store.\n\nBut Weibo then took the app offline after a microblogger said the logo was nearly identical to one designed by South Korean studio font for the Ulju Mountain Film Festival in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe apologise to the designer and also to our friends that care for us!\u201d it said in a post on Weibo. \u201cWe especially thank the user who flagged this to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have initiated an internal inspection of our design process and contacted the designer to solve the copyright issue.\u201d\n\nAn official of studio font said it had received an email and an apology from Weibo on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThey also said the internal investigation was underway,\u201d the official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters. \u201cWe are monitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nOasis said it would relaunch the app \u201csoon\u201d.\n\nA Weibo representative did not immediately respond to an email from Reuters to seek comment.", "description": "Chinese microblogging website Weibo Corp has taken down an Instagram-like app just three days after its launch and apologised following accusations of plagiarism about the app's logo, a stumble in efforts to find new sources of growth.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
