It\u2019s happened with renewed intensity lately because I dared criticise a number of well-liked men publicly. I didn\u2019t like Quentin Tarantino\u2019s new film? Someone wishes I would just \u201csuspend [my] tunnel-vision feminist views\u201d long enough to enjoy the movie (sorry, that film is almost three hours long, can\u2019t do it). I feel so-so about the upcoming Joker movie? Clearly, I\u2019m delivering a \u201cmilitant feminist rant\u201d or I'm the embodiment of \u201ctoxic feminism gone too far\u201d. I don\u2019t enjoy Dave Chappelle\u2019s new Netflix special? Wow, I must \"think I\u2019m so woke\".\n\nIt\u2019s a natural reaction, when someone calls you something in order to discredit you, to feel defensive. What? Me? I\u2019m not an angry feminist! Feminist, sure, but angry? I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m too cool for angry. I\u2019m too composed for angry. Angry is for children. It\u2019s for people who can\u2019t keep a lid on their emotions. Angry is disgraceful. Angry is bad.\n\nBut you know what? I am an angry feminist. I am so, so very angry about so many things, and I\u2019m done feeling embarrassed about that. How could I not be angry? Have you heard about\u2026 literally anything happening in the world right now? I wake up angry. My anger rides the subway with me. It sits with me at work. It\u2019s here when I go home at night and sometimes it even lets me sleep for a few hours.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nI\u2019m angry that 101 women have been killed in France, where I\u2019m from, since January, and that the government is only offering a measly \u20ac5m (less than \u00a34m and just about $5.5m) to finance efforts against domestic violence. I\u2019m angry that Megan Rapinoe can\u2019t campaign for equal pay in peace because rich men don\u2019t find her likeable enough. I\u2019m angry that, according to two studies released in 2011 and 2019 respectively, women are more likely to die in a car crash than their male counterparts because of a lack of research on how to best protect the female body in the event of a crash.\n\nI\u2019m still not over that moment (it sticks out in my mind, but it\u2019s one example among many) during the 2016 presidential campaign, when then-president-elect Donald Trump very casually and calmly stated that if Roe v. Wade is ever overturned, people who want an abortion will just \u201chave to go to another state\u201d \u2013 a suggestion delivered in such a blatantly detached tone that it became evident that the president of the United States had never once begun to even entertain the thought that maybe, maybe travelling to another state can be hard when you have limited financial resources and a work schedule and are not about to trade in your private plane for Air Force One. I\u2019m angry that, no matter what happens in 2020, in 2024, in 2028 and the years after that, the Supreme Court of the United States (where I live) will be conservative for the majority of, if not all, my adult life.\n\nFemale anger gets a bad rap. In fact, add that to the list of things I\u2019m angry about: I\u2019m furious that (white) male anger gets elevated to the sublime, by way of brooding love interests and tortured geniuses and misunderstood artists, while female anger is routinely ridiculed. Male anger gets you Joker, a film that has generated Oscar chatter and whose protagonist, as noted by movie critic and Pulitzer finalist Stephanie Zacharek, \u201ccould easily be adopted as the patron saint of incels\u201d. Male anger is an indignant Brett Kavanaugh choking up while defending himself against accusations of sexual assault in front of the Senate \u2013 and being rewarded for his behaviour while Hillary Clinton was criticised for daring to sound \u201cshrill\u201d.\n\nFemale anger, meanwhile, is Allison Reynolds in The Breakfast Club getting treated like a weirdo because she\u2019s a teenager dealing with stuff at home and chooses to express her angst by wearing \u201cblack s***\u201d under her eyes \u2013 which gets wiped off during a completely unnecessary makeover.\n\nMale anger is righteous. Female anger has to be repackaged and redirected into something more palatable, more convenient, more cute.\n\nWhenever the term \u201coutrage culture\u201d is uttered these days, it\u2019s usually with an ironic eye-roll. And sure, it can be exhausting to live in a reactive society in which it sometimes feels that no one can ever get anything completely right.\n\nBut outrage can be good. Anger can be great. Anger is what happens when you look at the world and decide that what you see isn\u2019t good enough. It\u2019s what drives you to enact the changes you want to see.\n\nThere is immense potential in anger. That\u2019s why people who think that MeToo is a \"witch hunt\" or that feminism has \"gone too far\" like to mock it and, ultimately, neutralise it: if they start taking that anger seriously, then they might have to start listening. Worse, they might have to start doing things. And doing things is scary and tiring and messy and there is literally no incentive to do it if you don\u2019t feel as though you will personally benefit from it.\n\nAnger is how you make noise, and noise is how you end up being heard. Anger is how you demand to be seen and ask for what you deserve. Use it accordingly. Use it especially, and unapologetically, if you're a woman.", "description": "I\u2019ve lost count of the times I\u2019ve been called an angry feminist (or some variation on the same theme).
