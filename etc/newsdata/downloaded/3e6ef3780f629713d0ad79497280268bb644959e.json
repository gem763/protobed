White House sources also confirmed the report, the Australian ABC reported.\n\nAccording to two officials with knowledge of the call, Trump asked Morrison to help the US attorney general, William Barr, find evidence for a review into the Mueller inquiry.\n\nMorrison leaning into Trump might have a strange logic \u2013 but it's a risky strategy | Katharine Murphy Read more\n\nThe White House restricted access to the call\u2019s transcript to a small group of the president\u2019s aides, echoing a strategy used to conceal Trump\u2019s July phone call with the Ukrainian president, the Times reported.\n\nOn Tuesday morning the Australian government confirmed the call had taken place and said Morrison had agreed to assist.\n\n\u201cThe Australian government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe PM confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the president.\u201d\n\nThe dialogue between the Trump administration and the Morrison government has apparently been playing out for some months. On 25 May Trump blasted Australia before leaving on a trip to Japan, declaring he wanted Australia\u2019s role in setting off the FBI inquiry into links between Russia and his election campaign examined by Barr. Trump said he hoped Barr would \u201clook at the UK and I hope he looks at Australia and I hope he looks at Ukraine. I hope he looks at everything, because there was a hoax that was perpetrated on our country.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, signalled the government was prepared to contribute to the Barr investigation. Payne said at the time Australia had not yet been asked but \u201cwe would, of course, consider such a request were it to be made\u201d.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s spray, Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US, Joe Hockey, wrote to Barr, copying in the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. In a letter released on Tuesday, Hockey said: \u201cThe Australian government will use its best endeavours to support your efforts in this matter.\n\n\u201cWhile Australia\u2019s former high commissioner to the United Kingdom, the Hon Alexander Downer, is no longer employed by the government, we stand ready to provide you with all the relevant information to support your inquiries.\u201d\n\nThe Mueller inquiry looked at whether Trump worked with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election and delivered its report in April this year, but Mueller testified to Congress in July that its implications continued into the future.\n\nThe Mueller investigation began after Australia\u2019s former foreign affairs minister, Downer, was allegedly told about the interference by George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign aide. Downer then informed the FBI.\n\n\u200bAccording to Downer, Papadopoulos told him during \u201ca night of heavy drinking\u201d\u200b in May 2016 \u200bthat Russia had obtained damaging information about Hillary Clinton from her emails.\n\nScott Morrison praises Donald Trump's political priorities Read more\n\nThe US president has described Barr\u2019s review as \u201cinvestigating the investigators\u201d, and has accused former FBI officials of \u201ctreason\u201d.\n\nIn May Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, told ABC Radio: \u201cWe don\u2019t intend to engage in a public commentary that might entail any risk that we\u2019re seen to prejudice the ongoing examination of these matters in the US.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Downer happened to be a guest on ABC\u2019s Radio National breakfast program, discussing China, when the story broke. \u201cI had no idea until this moment you were going to talk to me about this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to say about it beyond what I\u2019ve ever said. I don\u2019t know anything at all about conversations that Scott Morrison has had with Donald Trump. These days it\u2019s not something I am privy to.\n\n\u201cI had a conversation with this guy [Papadopoulos], I passed on one element of the convo to the Americans. There is nothing more to it.\u201d\n\nPapadopoulos has denied Downer\u2019s account of events. He welcomed the news that Australia would cooperate with the US.\n\n\u201cBye, bye Downer,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nA spokeswoman for Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, said the prime minister needed to explain his actions. \u201cIt is being alleged that president Trump asked Scott Morrison for help in dealing with his political opponents.\n\n\u201cScott Morrison must immediately come clean on what was discussed. Australians will wonder if any of the treatment he received from the US administration is related to these allegations.\u201d", "description": "President urged Scott Morrison to help gather information aimed at discrediting investigation into Russian interference in 2016 US election, and Australia says it was \u2018ready to assist\u2019", "authors": ["Naaman Zhou"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23a3248b591c9e2c0bbf8ea5cdfc3ac59633c0a9/0_206_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e83fe0d9d9bf7978e8cfa7de26a76c33", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
