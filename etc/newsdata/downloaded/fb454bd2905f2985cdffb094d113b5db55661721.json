In fact, seven in 10 parents confess to sometimes sending their child to school, even when they know that they are ill, according to a recent poll by British health and hygiene company Essity. Worse, more than a third of the 2,000 surveyed moms and dads with kids ages 3 to 16 believe that a bug has spread around school as a result of their kid showing up sick.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep the kids home anytime they\u2019re sniffly or coughing, or they wouldn\u2019t be at school at all,\u201d said Fung, the CEO of Upparent, a recommendation-sharing site for parents. She told MarketWatch that she does always keep them home if they\u2019ve been vomiting or have a fever, however.\n\nRandy Hayashi, the COO of payment processing company Payment Depot, also shared that he\u2019s sent his sixth grader and high school freshman in \u201ckind of sick\u201d at times. \u201cIt is really hard not to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact every year at the end of the school year, when that small handful of kids get their perfect attendance award, I chuckle to myself thinking, \u2018Congratulations, you went to school while sick more than any other kid.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn fact, most of the parents surveyed by Essity (70%) said that their child has come to school with a cold. And even pediatricians like Dr. Sara Siddiqui from NYU Langone\u2019s Hassenfeld Children\u2019s Hospital say that\u2019s OK \u2014 within reason.\n\n\u201cIf we kept everyone home for some nasal congestion and cough, your kids would be home the whole entire fall season,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a fever [100.4 degrees Fahrenheit for kids under two months old, and 101 and up for everyone else] is the part that indicates whether they are contagious or not.\u201d Kids should stay home from school until they\u2019ve gone 24 hours without a fever \u2014 and while off of fever reducers like Johnson & Johnson\u2019s JNJ, -0.68% Tylenol or Pfizer\u2019s PFE, +0.39% Advil. They should also stay home for 24 hours after vomiting, or if they have recurring diarrhea twice a day or more, she said.\n\nSTUDIOGRANDOUEST/iStock Most parents have sent a little one feeling under the weather to school. Here\u2019s why.\n\nYet around one in five surveyed parents revealed they had sent their child to school with an ear infection (22%) or with a viral infection (19%). Seventeen percent confessed their kids came to school with diarrhea or vomiting \u2014 and 14% said they sent their kid in with the chicken pox before the spots fully scabbed over and stopped being contagious. Worse, almost one in four admitted they schooled their young scholar to lie about their health to stay in school.\n\nErin Reeder, a mother of four girls ages two to seven, recognizes the struggle for both parents and schools: she\u2019s an adjunct history professor, and her husband is a school psychologist in Gilbert, Ariz. \u201cWe\u2019re acutely aware of how frustrating it can be when sick kids spread illness throughout the student body,\u201d she told MarketWatch. \u201cBut on the other hand, as two working parents, we know how hard it can be to find alternate arrangements for sick kids.\u201d\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s sometimes sent one of the girls back to class without waiting for them to be fever-free for a full 24 hours, as doctors recommend, but otherwise she and her husband have learned to methodically run through the ailing child\u2019s symptoms to determine if they are contagiously sick, or if that scratchy throat could be allergies, or that tummy ache is stress. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that our intuition has been pretty \u2018on\u2019 in this department,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve sent complaining kids to school, they\u2019ve always ended up not really being sick.\u201d\n\nThe parents that MarketWatch spoke with said that they didn\u2019t want to contribute to germs already running rampant in many daycares and public schools. But similar to the moms and dads in the Essity study, they\u2019re often caught juggling work, parenting and financial responsibilities.\n\n\u201cThe struggle is real,\u201d said Reeder, who also blogs at The Incremental Mama. She and her husband often have to piecemeal a caregiving strategy together, such as him working from home and taking conference calls while caring for their child in the morning, until Reeder can take over once her classes are done after lunch. \u201cEvery time is a little different for us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s often deciding, for which one of you will it be the least painful to miss work today?\u201d\n\nSo what are the major reasons that parents get stuck sending sick kids to school?\n\nWork Stress\n\nMost parents in the Essity survey blamed work pressure for not keeping their children home. Almost one in three said they couldn\u2019t afford to miss any more time on the job, and more than one in five worried about what their co-workers would think of them if they stayed home to care for their children.\n\nParents just don\u2019t have workplace flexibility: Only 15% of American private sector workers get paid leave, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nRelated: The real reason companies like Target are offering paid parental leave and child-care\n\nAnd those lucky enough to have paid sick days only have about 11 on average if they are full-time workers, and seven if they\u2019re part-time. One bad cold can last seven to 10 days, and it\u2019s normal for kids to catch six to 10 colds a year. Even shorter stomach bugs or cases of pinkeye that run for a few days apiece add up fast. And that gets into school attendance requirements.\n\nFung noted that kids in her school district are considered truant after they\u2019ve missed nine or 10 days of school in a semester. And considering her three kids often pass colds and other bugs around and around, \u201cthose two or three days at a time add up,\u201d she said. \u201cSo another factor we consider when deciding whether our child should stay home is, \u2018Well, if they\u2019re just a little sick and not contagious, and they can probably pay attention and engage, then let\u2019s not keep them home that 10th day.\u2019\u201d\n\nChildcare costs\n\nMany parents who can\u2019t afford to miss work also can\u2019t afford to pay someone to watch their sick kids.\n\nChildcare costs have shot up to almost $10,000 a year for just one child\u2019s day care, and babysitters command upwards of $16 an hour. While the Department of Health and Human Services says that families shouldn\u2019t spend more than 7% of their income on child care, there\u2019s not a single state in America where parents can stick to that budget.\n\nRelated: Child-care costs in America have soared to nearly $10K per year\n\n\u201cOur saving grace is flexibility with work,\u201d said Reeder. Fung is also fortunate to be able to work from home, as well as having family nearby who can watch the kids in a pinch.\n\nBut many parents aren\u2019t so fortunate. This single mom from South Carolina told MarketWatch that she has seen her income shrink from $15 an hour to $9 thanks to daycare costs. Almost 2 million parents with kids ages five and younger had to quit their job, refuse an offer or switch jobs in 2016 because of child care issues.\n\nRelated: How a lack of good, inexpensive day care rocked one woman\u2019s career\n\nA cademic pressure\n\nIn some cases, the kids themselves insist on going to school even when they\u2019re not feeling well. A quarter of parents in the Essity report said they sent their sick kid to class because the child didn\u2019t want to miss something important like a field trip.\n\nHayashi said his kids \u201cwant nothing to do with a sick day from school,\u201d because junior high and high school has become so competitive. Indeed, a recent Office Depot survey ODP, -0.60% found that almost one in four parents think their children get more homework than they can handle. A 2015 study published in the American Journal for Family Therapy found that primary school children receive about three times the amount of homework recommended by the National Education Association.\n\n\u201cThey feel like if they miss a day or two, they will fall behind and it will be hard to catch up,\u201d said Hayashi. \u201cThey will only agree to stay home when they are feeling so bad that there is no way to send them. Times have changed since we were kids and tried to miss school and have a \u2018Ferris Bueller\u2019 day.\u201d", "description": "Work and school pressures are to blame, moms and dads tell MarketWatch", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS074_SickGi_ZG_20190925164035.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
