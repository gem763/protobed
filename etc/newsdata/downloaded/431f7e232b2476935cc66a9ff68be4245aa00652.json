Wonder what Vic thinks of the Hot Priest\u2026\n\nThe fashion designer continued: \u2018I love Fleabag, obsessed with her. So, the fact that I got to meet her was really, really exciting.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo doubt the feeling was mutual.\n\nVic has no problem getting older (Picture: WireImage)\n\nVictoria, 45, also opened up about her determination to grow old gracefully, as they say, and embrace her age.\n\nThe former popstar admits that she\u2019s saying no to cosmetic surgery right now, simply because she\u2019s \u2018fine with growing older\u2019.\n\nAlthough she seems to have forgotten that she had a boob job back in the noughties.\n\nShe explained: \u2018I\u2019m fine with growing older. I\u2019m not trying to look any younger at all. I just wanna look good for my age.\n\n\u2018I wanna look like the best version of myself. I wanna look after what I have. I don\u2019t really want to change anything. And I\u2019m okay with that. I like how getting older feels.\u2019\n\nVic added: \u2018I\u2019m okay with how it looks, because it is what it is. Everybody is going to get older. [But] I don\u2019t love how it [getting older] sounds.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s face it, Vic hasn\u2019t really aged much since her Spice Girls heyday of the \u201890s, has she?\n\nThis Morning airs weekdays at 10:30am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
