Dictatorships fall not only when they have implacable opponents but also exemplary victims: Steve Biko in South Africa, Benigno Aquino in the Philippines, Jerzy Popieluszko in Poland. Through their deaths, they awakened the living to the conviction that it was the regime that should die instead.\n\nToday, Nemtsov continues to haunt the Kremlin. So do Sergei Magnitsky, Natalia Estemirova, Alexander Litvinenko and Anna Politkovskaya, to name just a few of the regime\u2019s murdered adversaries. At some point, a growing list of victims will start to weigh heavily against Putin\u2019s chances of staying in power. The death of a galvanizing opposition figure could be the tipping point.\n\nEspecially when the political-survival formula that has worked for Putin so far is coming unstuck. That formula \u2014 enrich your cronies, terrify your foes, placate the urban bourgeoisie with a decent standard of living, and propagandize everyone else with heavy doses of xenophobic nationalism \u2014 no longer works so well in an era of Magnitsky sanctions, international ostracism, a persistently stagnant economy, middling oil prices, unpopular pension reforms, and dubious foreign adventures.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bret Stephens", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Putin-Russia.Html"], "top_image": ""}
