Investing.com -- Here are the highlights of Thursday's regulatory releases from the London Stock Exchange. Please refresh for updates. Pharma group AstraZeneca (LON: ) raised its sales guidance for the year after reporting a strong third quarter driven by 30% revenue growth in China. It now expects sales at constant exchange rates to rise \"by a low to mid-teens percentage\", having earlier guided for just over 10%. Reported earnings per share fell 15% in constant exchange rates due to a one-off gain last year. Stripped of that factor, EPS rose by 38 to $2.61. The company's cancer drugs performed particularly strongly, with sales rising 67% at constant exchange rates. \"With AstraZeneca growing at pace, our sales guidance has been upgraded for the second consecutive quarter. Another strong performance from our new medicines accompanied impressive results in our key markets, most notably in China, the US and Japan,\" CEO Pascal Soriot said in a statement. \"The performance reinforces our confidence in delivering sustainable earnings growth.\" Royal Bank of Scotland PLC (LON: ) swung to a net loss of 315 million pounds ($409 million) in the third quarter, due mainly to a 900 million pound charge for PPI claims. The bank's core lending and markets businesses also suffered, with NatWest Markets swinging to a loss of 193 million pounds due to falling interest rates around the world, while the net margin on its loan book fell by 5 basis points to 1.97% due to intense competition in the U.K. mortgage market. The PPI charge is at the top end of the range for by the bank last month.\n\nPremarket London: AstraZeneca Scores in China; RBS Swings to 3Q Loss", "description": "Premarket London: AstraZeneca Scores in China; RBS Swings to 3Q Loss", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPED7G0IN_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
