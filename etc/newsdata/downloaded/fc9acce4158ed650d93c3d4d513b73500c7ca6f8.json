While it\u2019s challenging to predict what zingers the candidates will deploy, one thing is more certain: Moderate and reasonable policy ideas will take a backseat to far-fetched proposals that belong more in the realm of fairytale.\n\nThe discussion will likely veer even further to the left compared to previous debates. Some of the less extreme candidates \u2014 including Sen. Michael Bennet and former Congressman John Delaney \u2014 will not be participating in Thursday\u2019s spectacle.\n\nHurricane Dorian will be Exhibit A for the \u201cclimate crisis.\u201d Opinions range broadly on the matter. Some argue changes to climate are largely cyclical, although influenced by human behavior. Others predict it will be impossible to avert doomsday if Americans don\u2019t immediately purchase a Prius. The 2020 Democratic hopefuls argue it\u2019s closer to the latter end of the spectrum.\n\nTo address the problem, many of the candidates argue for radical regulation, but a select few take it a step further. Sen. Bernie Sanders recently introduced his version of the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d \u2014 mirroring a package of policies initially proposed by climate authority Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nIn part, his plan would federalize the U.S. energy sector, construct a new power grid and replace all current forms of energy production for electricity and transportation with renewable alternatives by 2030.\n\nSeem unfeasible yet? Well, the plan also includes creating 20 million new \u201cunion jobs\u201d and providing current fossil fuel industry workers with guaranteed wages, housing, health care and pensions. And all for the low, low price of $16 trillion; but for this week only.\n\nNext up on the left-wing bucket list is \u201cMedicare for All\u201d \u2014 a policy that was unpopular even among most Democrats just a few short years ago. It\u2019s no wonder why. The government takeover of the health care system would have major repercussions for all parties involved \u2014 including patients, hospitals, doctors, insurance providers and taxpayers.\n\nUnlike the \u201cyou can keep your plan if you like it\u201d mantra of Obamacare, Medicare for All would not simply hamstring insurance companies by forcing them to abide by stringent regulations, it would eliminate the entire private health insurance industry altogether. Adios consumer choice and competition.\n\nAs a result, medical professionals will be spread thin as demand for health care rises rapidly \u2014 resulting in shortages. And the reduced rate at which health care providers will be reimbursed under the plan would force many hospitals to close down \u2014 exacerbating the problem. Some estimate the reimbursement rate under Medicare for All to be as low as 60 percent of current private payouts.\n\nLook no further than the U.K. or Canada for real world train wrecks spurred by socialized medicine.\n\nDuring January of 2018, 80,000 patients in the U.K. waited more than four hours to be assigned a hospital gurney; 1,000 of those people waited longer than 12 hours. In 2017, nearly 89,000 operations in the U.K. were canceled the day of because of staffing, administrative or other non-clinical problems; nearly 4,000 of which were considered \u201curgent.\u201d\n\nCanada is not much better. The average wait time to be seen in an emergency room is about 10-times longer than in the United States. And while the average time before being sent home after an emergency room visit in the United States is under two hours, in Canada, 10 percent of patients waited nearly eight hours.\n\nWhat would it cost U.S. taxpayers to participate in such a comparatively worse system? Only $32.6 trillion over the next decade. And that number doesn\u2019t even include the unknowable number of people coming north because of the \u201copen borders\u201d suggestion.\n\nToo little space exists in the opinion pages of this newspaper to fully chronicle all of the far-fetched proposals that may be revisited Thursday evening. If you don\u2019t hear them all, you can add to your list amnesty for college debt, universal free college, a compulsory gun buy-back program, trillions of dollars for race reparations and packing the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn his 1996 State of the Union address, President Bill Clinton proclaimed, \u201cthe era of big government is over.\u201d For the realists in America, that is no longer true.\n\n\u2022 Richard Berman is the president of Berman and Co., a public relations firm in Washington, D.C.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
