That ends the Brexit deal hoped for the goverment for this weekend.\n\nMembers of the government left the House of Commons following the result of the vote as they no longer intend to participate in the vote on Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.\n\nThe Letwin amendment passed with 322 votes in favor and 306 against, giving the amendment a majority of 16. The amendment withholds approval of Johnson's deal until the legislation to enact it is passed.\n\nBoris Johnson took to his feet following the vote saying: \"the meaningful vote is now devoid of meaning\". The government will bring the deal back to parliament on Monday.\n\nJohnson is required by law to request an extension beyond the Oct. 31 date from the European Union, however he suggested in the House that he would not negotiate a delay with the EU, saying: \"I will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so.\"\n\nAccording to ITV's Paul Brand the PM will tell the EU to reject Parliament's request for a delay. Brand wrote on Twitter: \"BREAKING: No 10 source \u201cParliament has voted to delay brexit yet again. The PM will not ask for an extension - he will tell EU leaders there should be no delays, they should reject Parliament's letter asking for a delay, and we should get Brexit done on 31 October\u201d.", "description": "NewsBreak: UK Parliament Amendment Vote Ends Hope for Brexit Deal This Weekend", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEDA61LX_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
