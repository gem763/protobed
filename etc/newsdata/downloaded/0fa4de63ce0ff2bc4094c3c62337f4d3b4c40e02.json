You would think that, living in a world in which there are eels that just somehow fucken generate electricity, I would be thinking about eels basically all the time. But, no, days \u2014 sometimes even weeks \u2014 will pass before electric eels wriggle their way into my thoughts again. There are a lot of crazy-ass animals on this planet: flying squid, ancient sharks, semi-transparent frogs \u2014 but, for my money, you simply cannot beat a long, wet tube that can electrocute you.\n\nSince the mid-1700s, the scientific community has understood there to be only one species of electric eel \u2014 Electrophorus electricus, first described by botanist Carl Linnaeus \u2014 but findings published yesterday in the journal Nature Communications suggest that, actually, there\u2019s three of them, and one of them is waaay better at doing electric shocks than the others.\n\nResearchers examined 107 different specimens and studied their genetic differences, with the end result being the subdivision of what was previously just Electrophorus electricus into Electrophorus electricus, Electrophorus voltai, and Electrophorus varii.\n\nWhile the previously recorded record for voltage output from Electrophorus electricus was a mere 650 volts, researchers found that electric eels from the species Electrophorus voltai could produce a discharge of as much as 860 volts. I\u2019m no electrical engineer, but that seems like heaps of volts.\n\nThanks to the low amperage, this wouldn\u2019t be enough to kill you, but it\u2019s still enough to make you feel it. This is absolutely terrible practice and I would never normally quote from Wikipedia, but I really, really need you to read this paragraph:\n\nThis level of current is reportedly enough to produce a brief and painful numbing shock likened to a stun gun discharge, which due to the voltage can be felt for some distance from the fish; this is a common risk for aquarium caretakers and biologists attempting to handle or examine electric eels.\n\nEven better than that? The citation for the last sentence in that paragraph from a paper titled \u201cPractical considerations in the handling and care of electric eels\u201d, which was published in a journal called \u201cthe Journal of Experimental Zoology\u201d. God, science is amazing.\n\nWelcome to our scientific understanding of the world, you slippery electric bastard.", "description": "Researchers cataloguing electric eels in South America have identified a new species that is even more electric-y than the rest.", "authors": ["Ben Mcleay"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-551024547.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
