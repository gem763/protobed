The Wall Street Journal reported the automaker would invest, with partners, $1.3 billion near the idled factory. Other accounts said Lordstown was left out of the pact. The Journal report squares with the USA TODAY Network's Detroit Free Press reporting on a battery plant planned near the factory, while GM works to sell the plant to an enterprise linked to electric truck maker Workhorse Group of suburban Cincinnati.\n\nFrom left: Bill Goodchild and Justin Brown both of Local 1112 from Lordstown Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio at the Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit on Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019.

He worked 11 years at the Lordstown plant before transferring to GM\u2019s plant in Wentzville five months ago.\n\n\u201cI left my home and everything there in Lordstown,\" said Brown. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing in this contract for Lordstown, my vote is no. If they won\u2019t give it to us now, then I don\u2019t think we should settle the contract.\u201d\n\nMany members of the GM Lordstown Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio gather at the Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit on Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019, ahead of the GM-UAW vote on a new contract. More\n\nReady to stay on strike\n\nLikewise, Tommy Wolikow said, \u201cif they just throw Lordstown away, it\u2019ll be a no for me.\u201d\n\nWolikow works at Flint assembly, but he spent years working at Lordstown. He said if the 46,000 members are \u201ctrue union brothers and sisters and know the meaning of solidarity, they\u2019ll stick with us\u201d and reject the proposed tentative contract.\n\nUAW Local 1112 President @TimOHara1112 is prepared to vote no on a contract that doesn\u2019t include a product for #Lordstown. \u201cToday it\u2019s us. Tomorrow it could be somebody else.\u201d @MahoningMatters pic.twitter.com/oIqix6dUOJ \u2014 Jess Hardin (@jesslhardin) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no product for Lordstown, my vote is no,\u201d said William Goodchild, a laid-off Lordstown worker who came to GM\u2019s headquarters to make sure UAW leaders know the Lordstown issue matters.\n\nGoodchild, Wolikow, Brown and others at the rally said they are ready to stay on strike longer if need be to get a product for Lordstown. But Wolikow worries that some union members will see \u201cthe big carrot\u201d GM has offered in the form of a ratification bonus of at least $9,000 and \u201cbe bought out\u201d to ratify a tentative contract if the National GM Council recommends ratification.\n\nStory continues", "description": "About 40 to 50 UAW members chanted \u201cno product, no vote,\" saying they would reject their proposed deal with GM if the Lordstown plant remains closed.", "authors": ["Jamie L.
