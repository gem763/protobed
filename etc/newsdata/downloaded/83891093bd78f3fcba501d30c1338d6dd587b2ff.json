They were in a panic.\"\n\nInvestigators suspect a workplace dispute sparked the deadliest attack on police in France in years, sources said, but there were no immediate further details.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor is at the scene, but anti-terror agencies have not been involved at this stage.\n\n\"Did he snap, or was there some other reason? It's still too early to say,\" Loic Travers, head of the Alliance Police union for the Paris region, told BFM television.\n\nSuccession of attacks\n\nThere was no immediate indication of the possible motives of the attacker.\n\nFrance has been rocked since 2015 by a succession of attacks blamed on jihadists, which have included both large synchronised assaults and isolated knife and gun attacks, killing more than 250 people.\n\nThe country remains on high alert after these attacks.\n\nIn January 2015, two men armed with Kalashnikov rifles stormed the Paris offices of satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people.\n\nA police officer was killed just outside Paris the following day, while a gunman took hostages at a Jewish supermarket, four of whom were killed.\n\nOn November 15 that year, France was hit by the worst terror attacks in its history.\n\nIslamic State jihadists armed with assault rifles and explosives struck outside a France-Germany football match at the national stadium, Paris cafes, and the Bataclan concert hall in a coordinated assault that left 130 people dead and more than 350 wounded.\n\nOn July 14, 2016 a Tunisian ploughed a truck through a large crowd gathered for Bastille Day fireworks in the Mediterranean city of Nice. The attack killed 86 people and injured more than 400.\n\nThe attack at the police headquarters also came as tension grows within the ranks of the police force, who have been stretched to the limit by policing the \"yellow vest\" protests against French President Emmanuel Macron and have themselves been accused of heavy-handed tactics.\n\nThousands of French police officers demonstrated in Paris on Wednesday for better working conditions in a rare protest by the force, against the backdrop of a spike in suicides within their ranks.\n\nOrganisers estimated that 27 000 officers took part, out of 150 000 police staff nationwide.
