U.S. indices\u2014including the , , and \u2014fell Friday, after the recent whipsawing on a potential trade resolution with China finally ran out of steam.\n\nEquities reversed, ending what would have been a fourth straight week of gains. Yields plunged, extending their slide while the reversed course, turning a weekly decline into a gain.\n\nInvestors Reverse Into Save Haven Assests\n\nIt all started when President Donald Trump clarified that he wouldn\u2019t accept \u201ca partial deal\u201d with the world\u2019s second largest economy based on Beijing increasing its purchases of U.S. agricultural products. Then, a delegation of Chinese officials canceled a scheduled visit to Montana farms. Investors, who have had to quickly become geopolitical analysts, sold off risk assets and jumped back into safe havens such as the , and Treasurys.\n\nThough we have been cautious of market risk for quite some time, we find it noteworthy that President Trump made no follow-up statement on the subject. His twitter account instead focused on domestic politics. Did investors make a bigger deal about Friday\u2019s developments than was necessary?\n\nMeanwhile, officially, trade meetings remain on the docket. However, we're skeptical that the Chinese are incentivized to compromise with an embattled president ahead of the 2020 U.S. election. We believe investors, and markets, are likely going to be mired in this for the long haul.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 0.51% for the week. shares were the obvious weekly underperformer, -2.46%, as well as one of Friday's two laggards, -1.15%, illustrating the direct link to the renewal of trade fears. On the final day of last week's trading, was the worst performing sector, -1.17%, a result of its centrality in the dispute, particularly to issues of patent theft and national security.\n\nSPX Daily\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Friday\u2019s close\u2014which was the lowest for the benchmark index in a week\u2014fell back slightly below the uptrend line since the December bottom. The index jumped back above it on Sept. 5 after falling below it precisely a month earlier.\n\nThursday\u2019s high was just 0.2% from the index's all-time high, hit on July 26. A fall below Wednesday's 2979.40 trough would complete a small double top. The index may find strong support at the August congestion.\n\nUST 10-Y Daily\n\nYields on the Treasury note slid for a fifth day. What started as a sudden bargain after the Fed on turned into a haven amid the renewed US-Sino tensions. Technically, the rate is being squeezed between the 100 and 50 DMA, below the downtrend line since November.\n\nUSD/JPY Weekly TTM\n\nThe yen surged on Friday, even against a strengthening dollar. From a technical perspective, the weekly trade activity developed a shooting star which halted a three straight week advance, at the top of a falling channel, suggesting a resumption of the downtrend to retest the 105.00 levels.\n\nGold Daily\n\nGold's trajectory was the same as the yen. The yellow metal ended a three-week slump on Friday. Technically, too, it bounced off the bottom of a falling channel. Should this uptick continue, it would blow out a H&S top, propelling the commodity even higher.\n\ntrimmed most of its biggest intraday gains on Friday, but retained its biggest weekly accumulation of the year after last weekend's drone attacks on an Aramco production facility and Saudi oil field caused the commodity to jump 20% higher at last Monday's open. Risk, however, remains. Saudi Arabia warned that if the attack was proven to be from Iran the Desert Kingdom would consider it an act of war.\n\nFor Iran\u2019s part, the country's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif threatened that war may be unavoidable, even if he tempered the remarks by insisting Iran will not make the first move. In another address he quipped that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are willing to fight his country \u201cto the last American.\u201d\n\nOil Weekly\n\nTechnically, oil\u2019s medium-term uptrend has yet to prove itself after last week\u2019s advance fizzled, distancing the price from the April peak to establish an uptrend.\n\nWeek Ahead\n\nAll times listed are EDT\n\nMonday\n\nTuesday\n\n3:30: Germany \u2013seen to have slightly advanced in September to 44.0 from 43.5.\n\n22:00: New Zealand \u2013 : expected to remain steady at 1.00%.\n\nWednesday\n\nThursday\n\n10:30: U.S. \u2013probably advanced to 660K from 635K.10:30: U.S. \u2013came in at 1.058 million barrels last week.\n\n8:30: U.S. \u2013 : forecast to plunge in Q2 to 2.0% from 3.1% in the first quarter.\n\n10:00: U.S. \u2013 : seen to surge MoM to 1.0% in August from -2.5% in the previous month.\n\nFriday\n\n8:30: U.S. \u2013 : likely jumped to 0.2% from -0.4% MoM.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com covering: USD/JPY, XAU/USD, S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average.
