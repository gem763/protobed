While there is no \u201cfixing\u201d this deep of a loss, there are things that friends and family can do to support them as they grieve.\n\nAuthor Kimberly Calabrese, who lost her daughter Paris at six months old, wrote the book What Do I Do? A Step by Step Guide for Friends and Family to Support Anyone Who Has Lost a Child to help loved ones navigate this tragic time \u2014 from the moment you receive the message that their child has died and well into the future.\n\nGet there right away\n\nOne of the most important things a close friend can do in the immediate aftermath of the loss of a child is show up, Calabrese says. Don\u2019t assume someone else is taking the reins to help with funeral arrangements, arrange meals at the home, make phone calls and provide rides from the airport. Even if your loved one has a large family, they still need you.\n\n\u201cWhen we lose a child, we lose our immediate family for support at the beginning because they\u2019re grieving, too,\u201d she says. \u201cBut our friends think we have all this family support around us.\u201d\n\nThe parents\u2019 close friends should band together and divide up the tasks \u2014 and at the top of the list should be assigning someone to be with the parents at all times, particularly to take notes about funeral arrangements and make sure that all necessary details are being addressed.\n\nBut Calabrese stresses to also make sure someone is always with any living siblings of the child who died, to play with them, talk to them and get them out of the house for breaks as needed.\n\n\u201cImagine finding out that your sibling died, and you don\u2019t even know what that means,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd everyone is crying around them and people forget about them because everyone is so focused on their parents.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t ask what they need\n\nIt\u2019s easy to feel helpless when someone you love is experiencing something as awful and unfixable as the loss of a child. You want to help, but you don\u2019t know how to help. One thing you shouldn\u2019t do? Is ask them how you can help. They have no idea what they need, Calabrese says.\n\n\u201cThey ask us (what we need) but we\u2019re looking at you like you have 10 eyes because we don\u2019t even understand what just happened,\u201d she says.\n\nInstead, make a list of everything you do in a given day, week or month. You do laundry and make lunches for your living children, you go grocery shopping and take the trash out. These are the things they need, particularly if a certain task or errand is one in which they may see a lot of children.\n\nCheck in once a week\n\nOnce the funeral is over and most of the extended family and friends have left town, physically check in once a week for at least the first year. Be consistent and be relentless. Bring them a salad, take them out for coffee or just stop by to run the vacuum cleaner and make a list to take to the grocery store.\n\n\u201cEspecially if there are siblings involved,\u201d Calabrese says. \u201cHow do we know they\u2019re even getting out of bed? You don\u2019t know unless you show up.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a long-distance friend, call at least once a week and be in contact with their local friends or family to ensure that someone is physically showing up frequently to check on them and offer support.\n\nRemember the important dates\n\nReach out to them on the important dates. Their child\u2019s birthday and the anniversary of their death are obvious ones, but also remember to acknowledge them on Mother\u2019s Day or Father\u2019s Day. Check in on other holidays, too, particularly in the first year, Calabrese says\u2014and especially if they have other children. It may be a struggle for them to want to celebrate anything, and friends can step in to help make the holidays special for the other kids.\n\n\u201cHow do we know they\u2019re even getting out of bed? You don\u2019t know unless you show up.\u201d\n\nAlso, continue to invite them to your own celebrations. They might not make it to your wedding shower or your kid\u2019s birthday party (and do not take it personally if they don\u2019t), but Calabrese says you should continue to include them. They will come when they\u2019re ready.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the dads\n\nA grieving father\u2019s friends may sometimes have more work to do than a mother\u2019s friends, Calabrese says, in terms of getting them to open up about their loss.\n\n\u201cThe parents do both need equal support, but what I\u2019ve noticed (in parent support groups) is that men were joining by themselves 7-10 years after the loss of their child,\u201d Calabrese says. \u201cMen are taught you don\u2019t cry, you don\u2019t grieve, you say everything is ok, and then it catches up to them.\u201d\n\nShow up frequently and consistently, even if one parent outwardly seems to be doing better than the other.\n\nBe a good listener\n\nYou don\u2019t have to have an answer or explanation for why your loved one is going through something so devastating. And if you feel the urge to come up with one, fight it hard. When they are ready or need to talk about it, your role is only to listen. They talk, you listen.\n\nIf there\u2019s a pause in the conversation and you\u2019re not sure what to say, Calabrese suggests you simply try, \u201cI\u2019m so glad I can be here to listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to tell our story over and over and over again,\u201d she says. \u201cWe get something new out of it by being able to replay what happened ... and you\u2019re giving us that permission to keep speaking.\u201d", "description": "If someone close to you has ever lost a child, you know how devastating that type of loss can be \u2014 and how utterly helpless it can feel to those who love them and can\u2019t ease their pain.
