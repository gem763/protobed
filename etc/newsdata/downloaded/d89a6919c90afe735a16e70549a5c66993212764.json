Were it not for the initial immune response, all infections would eventually lead to death.\n\nWhat koalas have yet to evolve is a second phase of response in which specialized small ribonucleic acids (RNAs), which play crucial regulatory roles in various processes, are produced to turn off the virus.\n\n\"So we're seeing the initial response,\" said Theurkauf. \"The question is, can we find koalas that have turned on the next phase where they're really shutting it down?\"\n\nIt's unclear whether this has already happened in some koalas or, if not, how long it will take for the species to evolve the response. If they do not, the virus \"could be a mechanism of extinction,\" he added.\n\nThe northern population that got infected first are the likeliest to have evolved, and the team plans to investigate them next.\n\nAlternatively, humans could one day intervene to accelerate evolution via genetic engineering, rather than waiting for the koalas to get there by themselves -- though the science is still a long way off.\n\nIn the meantime, though, koalas are a living example of \"something that every organism on the planet has gone through,\" said co-author Zhiping Weng, also at UMass Medical School.\n\n\"Animals get infected by retroviruses that enter the germline cells. These viruses multiply and insert into the chromosomes, altering host genome organization and function, and the process continues until the invader is tamed by the host,\" Weng said.\n\n\"At the end of this infection cycle, the host has changed.\"", "description": "Wild koalas sickened by a deadly retrovirus are fighting the disease at the genetic level, scientists said Thursday, a rare evolutionary process unfolding before our eyes.
