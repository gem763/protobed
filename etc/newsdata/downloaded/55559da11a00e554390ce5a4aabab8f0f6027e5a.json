(AP Photo/Ronald Zak)\n\nNever let a crisis go to waste, as the saying goes.\n\nThose trying to shape U.S. energy policy are heeding that advice \u2014 versions of which have been attributed to Winston Churchill and Rahm Emanuel \u2014 in the wake of a series of suspected drone attacks targeting Saudi Arabia's oil facilities.\n\nThose seeking to wean the United States off of petroleum point to the precariousness of the world's oil supply as all the more reason for the U.S. to double down on alternatives to gasoline-powered cars and other clean technology.\n\nBut those in the oil and natural gas business, along with their allies in Washington, say the problem isn't with petroleum itself \u2014 it's where it comes from. They point to the strikes against the desert kingdom as reason for the United States to secure sources of oil and gas within its own borders.\n\nAt the center of the forthcoming U.S. response to the strike is President Trump, who is already arguing that the U.S. position as the world's top oil producer helps insulate it from the loss of Saudi oil.\n\nPLENTY OF OIL! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nTo address the shortfall, Trump said he has authorized the release of oil from the nation's strategic reserves \u2014 \u201cif needed,\u201d he tweeted \u2014 to blunt the impact on American motorists. The blasts at facilities in the districts of Khurais and Abqaiq forced Saudi officials to suspend production of 5.7 million barrels of crude per day. That's nearly 6 percent of the 100 million barrels consumed every day.\n\nBut Sen. Edward J. Markey, one of Trump's chief environmental critics in Congress, called tapping the strategic oil supply, stored in caverns under Louisiana and Texas, a foolish waste of resources.\n\nPutting an even finer point on this criticism, the Massachusetts Democrat, one of the chief sponsors of the Green New Deal, reiterated his call for an economywide transition away from greenhouse gases in the wake of the attack. Markey also promised to introduce legislation to reinstate a ban on selling U.S. crude abroad.\n\n\u201cWe need to end, once and for all, our dependence on oil from the Middle East and the kinds of volatility that comes with unrest in the region,\u201d Markey said in a statement. \u201cEnergy independence won\u2019t be found in a Saudi Oil field, but in an American solar farm.\u201d\n\nThe GOP-controlled Congress, working with President Obama, lifted the decades-long ban on crude exports in 2015 as the use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, led to a boom in domestic oil and gas production. But now a number of candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for president \u2014 including Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2014 have called for reinstalling the export moratorium.\n\nBut Rick Perry, Trump's energy secretary, reached the opposite conclusion after the Saudi attack. The United States needs to sell more of its oil abroad to water down the impact of oil reductions such as this, he said.\n\n\u201cThis ought to be a wake-up call all across this country, particularly around the world, but particularly in America, the No. 1 oil and gas producing company in the world. We need to build out our infrastructure to ensure America\u2019s record amount of oil supply gets to the global marketplace,\u201d Perry said on CNBC on Monday.\n\nPerry also admonished another Democrat, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose administration is blocking the construction of pipelines to get natural gas from Pennsylvania to New England, which during the winter relies at times on imported gas.\n\n\u201cTheir governor and their legislature think that that\u2019s good politics,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWell, it may be good politics internally in New York, but it\u2019s bad national security.\u201d To that end, Perry's counterparts at the Environmental Protection Agency are trying to limit states' power to block pipelines and other energy projects.\n\nTim Charters, vice president of governmental and political affairs at the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents offshore oil and gas drillers, saw the Saudi oil outage as reason to pursue yet another Trump administration goal.\n\nTo secure its independence from oil-rich foreigners, the United States should lean into \u2014 not away from, as Markey suggests \u2014 its own oil boom by opening more of the U.S. continental shelf for offshore drilling, he contended.\n\n\u201cThe fragility in the Middle East shows that those who say we can turn our back on American-produced energy are foolish and risk our economic and energy security,\u201d Charters said. \u201cIn reality, the U.S. should be looking to broaden offshore energy exploration to discover new resources, secure our energy future and strengthen our economy.\u201d\n\nEarly on, the Trump administration tried to plan lease sales for untapped swaths of the Atlantic, Pacific and Florida Gulf. But the effort stalled as Republicans along the coasts voiced opposition to the drilling proposals.\n\nConstantine Samaras, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon, offered a bit of advice for Trump on Twitter following the bombings. He called on the country to expand tax breaks for electric vehicles and double funding for the federal government's energy technology incubator.\n\n\"The way to insulate the United States economy from an oil price spike is to make the transportation sector much less reliant on oil in any form,\" Samaras said in an interview. \"We basically have all our transportation eggs in the oil basket, and as long as that's the case, the economy is vulnerable.\"\n\nThat advice, though, runs counter to what the administration is actually doing. The White House has called for an end to both electric vehicle tax credits and the Energy Department incubator program.\n\nIn the end, it's Trump's takeaways from the attacks that will end up mattering the most. Trump has concluded because of the decade-long surge in U.S. oil production, \"[w]e don\u2019t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas, & in fact have very few tankers there.\"\n\nTrump is almost right. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects the United States will be a net energy exporter by next year.\n\nBut there are a few wrinkles in Trump's rosy picture. Gulf Coast refineries are generally designed not to process the light, sweet crude produced here at home \u2014 but rather the heavy, sour crude that comes from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.\n\nWhat's more, because the price of oil is set by the push and pull between buyers and sellers around the world, American motorists are not as invulnerable to oil market fluctuations as Trump suggests. In fact, drivers could see a 10- to 25-cent jump in gasoline prices in the coming weeks, according to The Post's Taylor Telford and Thomas Heath.\n\n\"What really mattered is the price people pay at the pump,\" said Samantha Gross, a Brookings Institution fellow working on energy and environmental policy. \"And because oil is priced on a global market, just because it's produced here doesn't mean we get some sort of special deal when there's an interruption somewhere.\"\n\nYou are reading The Energy 202, our must-read tipsheet on energy and the environment.

Democracy Forward pointed to recent reports that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened to fire a NOAA official over tweets refuting Trump\u2019s assertions about Hurricane Dorian and Alabama. The group cited concerns about Ross\u2019s removal of Gallaudet, who it said had a \u201creputation for refusing to subject NOAA\u2019s climate research to political interference.\u201d\n\nTHERMOMETER\n\nChildren playing in a water fountain in Antwerp, Belgium, in July.

The agency found that last month tied as the second-hottest August in the agency\u2019s 140-year records, The Post\u2019s Andrew Freedman reports. \u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable about 2019\u2032s record warmth is that it comes in the absence of a strong El Ni\u00f1o event in the tropical Pacific Ocean,\u201d he writes.\n\nOne big reason is climate change: As average temperatures worldwide surge, \u201cit is becoming easier to exceed climate benchmarks even without strong El Ni\u00f1o events. For example, according to NOAA, the five hottest summers in the Northern Hemisphere have each occurred during the past five years.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The bots are here: There appears to have been a recent spike in Twitter activity that includes targeted attacks against scientists and environmental activists.
