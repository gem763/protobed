That, coupled with a return on the part of Americans to look at housing more speculatively as an investment, has Shiller thinking, \u201cwe\u2019re sneaking back into the old 2006 mentality.\u201d\n\n\u201cHousing is driven by narratives. Before 2007, the narrative was flipping houses [and the belief that] home prices have always gone up,\u201d the Yale economist said during an interview with Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM. \u201cThen, after the Great Recession, it was tragic narratives about people who lost their home, or dangers of borrowing too much or lending too much. It\u2019s been 10 years since the crisis. Now, those narratives are starting to be forgotten.\u201d\n\nNobel prize-winning Yale University economist Robert Shiller smiles at a news conference in New Haven, Conn. (AP Photo/Jessica Hill, File) More\n\nAs Shiller describes in his new behavioral economics-focused novel \u201cNarrative Economics,\u201d the bubble in housing prices witnessed leading up to the Great Recession would be a rather large one to match.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2005, median home prices in the U.S. rose 75% in real terms as measured by the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index, while the inflation-adjusted consumer price index for rent of primary residence index rose only 8%. That is to say, the rise in home prices was much larger than what could be explained by an unmet demand for housing. As Shiller notes, from 2012 to 2018, U.S. real home prices rose again by 35%, while real rents were only up 13%.\n\nHousing as an investment\n\nWhile the run up in home prices hasn\u2019t been as astronomical as the lead up to the Great Recession, interestingly Shiller says Americans are slowly returning to looking at housing as a speculative investment just as they were before the crisis. According to the annual survey Shiller has conducted with colleagues that asks buyers\u2019 about the considerations that spark a home purchase, about 49% said \u201cinvestment\u201d was a major consideration in 2004. That percentage fell to 32% in 2010, but rebounded to 42% in 2016.\n\nThis is of course not the first time Shiller has raised a reason to be concerned with the U.S. housing market. In November, when median home prices showed a slowing for the first time in a year, Shiller also made comparisons to 2006 \u2014 though he stressed at the time that any eventual bear market in housing likely wouldn\u2019t be as dramatic as the last downturn.\n\n\u201cYou have to remember, that the drop in home prices in the financial crisis was the most severe drop in the U.S. market since my data began in 1890,\u201d Shiller said at the time. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything as severe as the great financial crisis coming on right now.\u201d\n\nThe Nobel Laureate mostly stuck to the same wait-and-see thinking and mentioned his latest book was just the beginning of a \u201ccall \u201cfor more research, but research on people and not just on number crunching.\u201d\n\nZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
