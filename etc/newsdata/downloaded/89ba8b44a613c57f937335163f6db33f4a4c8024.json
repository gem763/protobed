The neighboring Three Mile Island Unit 2, owned by FirstEnergy, has been dormant since the 1979 accident that caused a partial nuclear meltdown \u2014 the worst commercial nuclear accident the U.S. has experienced.\n\nExelon also owns plants in Illinois, New York, New Jersey and Maryland. The first three of those states have all passed nuclear subsidy bills in recent years. But the Pennsylvania efforts failed amid opposition from consumer groups, some environmental activists and the state's natural gas industry.\n\n\n\nMarch 28, 1979: Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident\n\nPennsylvania has the second-largest nuclear fleet in the country, after Illinois. Nearly 40% of the state's electricity comes from nuclear power \u2014 more than is generated there by wind, solar and hydroelectric resources combined, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nBut despite its carbon-free credentials, the nuclear energy industry has been in trouble because it's a relatively expensive form of power compared with competing natural gas. Pennsylvania's Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station, which is owned by FirstEnergy and sits on the Ohio border, is scheduled to start shutting down next year.\n\nJust under 700 people work at Three Mile Island's Unit 1, making it the biggest employer in its county. Exelon has said that it would reassign all affected workers to other positions in the company.", "description": "The infamous nuclear reactor shuts down on the day of a mass walkout pushing for an end to fossil-fuel reliance", "authors": ["Irina Ivanova"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/20/5d351e49-6b25-41b4-998f-f253a8423921/thumbnail/1200x630/736b2d2cd8b0a08b7842d3f74a9e6c00/nuclear-gettyimages-1133148706.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
