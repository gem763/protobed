The foundation turned to a drone with a high-resolution heat-seeking camera to help them spot dogs that were hidden under rubble or were coming out at night.\n\nWith the heat signature, the team was able to spot him under the rubble, but he wasn\u2019t moving. When they pulled back the rubble, they learned why.\n\nMiracle was trapped underneath an air conditioning unit that had fallen on him. He survived by drinking rainwater, but without food, Miracle was emaciated.\n\n\u201cHe was very weak\u2026 He\u2019d probably lost about half his body weight,\u201d Kraus said.\n\nThere was another dog stuck under the rubble with Miracle, but unfortunately, he didn\u2019t make it.\n\nKraus said that while giving Miracle his well-earned name was a \u201cjoint effort,\u201d it was Big Dog Ranch Rescue's founder and president Lauree Simmons who first started calling the dog the name they all were thinking.\n\n\u201cLauree named him \u2018Miracle\u2019 not just because of the fact that he\u2019s a miracle -- that he lived for three and a half weeks on rainwater -- but also as an inspiration to all the people at Abaco and Grand Bahama that are trying to rebuild their lives,\u201d Kraus said.\n\n(MORE: Couple quits job, goes on almost 2-month search to find lost dog)\n\nBut the road to recovery for both Miracle and the foundation\u2019s rescue initiative is not over.\n\nMiracle is \u201cdoing well,\u201d but he isn\u2019t walking yet. He\u2019s undergoing treatment and therapy, as well as getting food and water. Kraus said that Miracle has begun putting on weight, and since coming in two days ago, he\u2019s already gone from 22 to 26 pounds.\n\nAs for the foundation, Miracle is just one of 112 dogs that Kraus said they\u2019ve rescued from the Bahamas so far, and they\u2019ve already reunited 57 dogs with their owners who lost pets on Abaco and Grand Bahama. After Hurricane Maria, he also said that they saved thousands of dogs in Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cThe dogs know who rescue them,\u201d Kraus said.\n\nFor those wondering if Miracle is looking for a home, Kraus said not to worry. If the rescue can\u2019t find his original family, they\u2019ve got offers coming from across the world, even from London and Australia -- all from families touched by the tenacity and strength of this little, \u201cMiracle\u201d dog.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had about 10,000 inquiries for a forever home \u2026 They keep pouring in,\u201d Kraus said.", "description": "The story of one dog\u2019s unbelievable survival after being trapped under rubble for more than three weeks may have you believing in miracles.
