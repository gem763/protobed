But with the threshold expected to rise to qualify for the November debate, the campaign said it\u2019s possible only four campaigns will have enough money \u201cto build and sustain the national organization needed to win the nomination.\u201d\n\nThe top four candidates in the race are former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, according to a RealClearPolitics average of national polls.\n\nDemissie said the Booker campaign has enough resources \u201cto continue on as we are now for quite some time, but that is not enough.\u201d Nor is having qualified for the next debate, he said, warning that the campaign must change its fundraising trajectory before the end of the month to have a viable operation.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line: Cory 2020 needs to raise an additional $1.7 million by September 30 to be in a position to build the organization necessary to continue competing for the nomination,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout a fundraising surge to close out this quarter, we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward.\u201d\n\nThe campaign acknowledged its financial shortcomings so far this month in what the campaign noted is a traditionally strong time for fundraising. The campaign said the additional funds are necessary to grow its operation over the next couple of months and continue competing against candidates who have much higher name recognition or were able to transfer millions of dollars over from a separate campaign account.\n\nDemissie insisted the memo, which was first reported by NBC News, isn\u2019t \u201can end-of-quarter stunt or another one of those memos from a campaign trying to spin the press\u201d but rather \u201ca real, unvarnished look under the hood of our operation at a level of transparency unprecedented in modern presidential campaigns.\u201d\n\nHe called the fundraising target a \u201cherculean challenge\u201d but noted it\u2019s not impossible: The campaign raised $1.4 million in the final 10 days of March.\n\n\u201cWe need to do it again (and more!), and we need you to step up to the challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be done \u2014 but only if we do it together.\u201d", "description": "The New Jersey senator's campaign manager said in a memo to Booker staff and supporters that an influx of cash was needed to build an organization that can compete.", "authors": ["Nolan D.
