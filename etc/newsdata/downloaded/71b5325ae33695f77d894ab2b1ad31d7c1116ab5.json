Many large-cap stocks and industry leaders in China ranging from Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), to China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), China Life Insurance Company (NYSE:LFC) or China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (NYSE:SNP) have produced lackluster or negative returns in their U.S.-listed American Depository Receipts. And certainly the trade war has been a drag on stock performance.\n\nBut Alibaba stock has been different. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s been easy. Still, the fact is BABA has gained about 23% in 2019. The return is more than the S&P 500\u2019s climb of 18% and towers above U.S. tech giant Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) 13% year-to-date increase.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhy is Alibaba Stock Different?\n\nSo, what is the deal with shares of BABA? Alibaba stock has and continues to defeat investors\u2019 fears within this macro-charged environment. Most recently BABA stock toppled Street profit and sales forecasts in mid-August.\n\nTo be certain, there\u2019s always going to be something or someone trying to get investors to back away from buying Alibaba despite its successes. For some that might include recent reports the U.S. is considering delisting Chinese stocks. And that threat can\u2019t be entirely ignored. Or maybe fake merchandise sales in the past or allegations of accounting shenanigans have prevented investors from taking action in BABA stock?\n\nOkay, so there\u2019s plenty of reasons not to buy BABA shares. But obviously those arguments don\u2019t include price performance. Most important, Alibaba stock continues to come out on top despite headline warnings and a challenging market for Chinese stocks. Now and with BABA crossing an important battle line on the price chart, it\u2019s time to put shares on the radar for a well-timed purchase.\n\n\n\n\n\nBABA Stock Weekly Chart\n\nAs noted above, capturing BABA stock\u2019s gains of around 23% hasn\u2019t been a walk in the park. And as expressed, bad press isn\u2019t likely to just disappear. The better news is I also don\u2019t believe Alibaba\u2019s impressive rally is finished. I see a solid entry for a risk-adjusted purchase of BABA stock.\n\nThe weekly chart shows that since failing from a breakout attempt to new highs last year, Alibaba stock has established a corrective symmetrical triangle base. It\u2019s not perfectly formed with clear-cut pivots to define the pattern, but the essence of this bullish formation is there.\n\nFollowing last week\u2019s price action, shares of Alibaba are in position to confirm a bullish engulfing candlestick which puts BABA stock back above the 50% retracement level of the base, as well as the triangle\u2019s apex line. With stochastics in a pullback set-up in neutral territory and on the verge of signaling a bullish crossover, the situation looks all the more promising.\n\nHow to Trade Alibaba\n\nI\u2019d recommend buying Alibaba shares above $174.88. This entry waits for the BABA stock price to confirm last week\u2019s candlestick and reinforces the bias for continued upside in the bullish triangle pattern. If BABA rallies, a breakout through angular resistance near $185 might be watched for adding shares on strength and before looking to take partial profits in-between $195-$215.", "description": "When it comes to diversified tech giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), being an investor comes with its share of harassment.
