That legislation, which the committee approved in a 6-1 vote, required that political ads on social media platforms be subject to the same rules that those on television or radio are.\n\nDavis pushed back against the SHIELD Act during the committee markup, describing it as \u201cunfixable in its current form.\u201d Davis proposed numerous amendments, most of which were voted down by the Democratic majority, including one that would have taken out the language on new online political advertisement rules.\n\nOne of Davis\u2019s primary concerns with the SHIELD Act was that it might violate free speech, particularly through the regulation of online political advertisements.\n\nThe House is expected to vote on the SHIELD Act next week, which will mark the third major election security bill to be pushed through the chamber this year.\n\nThe first two bills, the For the People Act and the SAFE Act, were passed by the Democratic-controlled House along party lines, but have since stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate due to concerns that they may federalize elections, and that they include non-election security language.
