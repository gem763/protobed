I think it was just a horrible accident that should never have happened,\u201d Santa Rosa County Sheriff Bob Johnson said at a press conference Thursday.\n\nFacebook Chris Bergan, 37, had just flown to Florida from Norway to surprise his father-in-law for his 62nd birthday when he was fatally shot.\n\nRoughly two hours before Bergan appeared at the home, Johnson said, Dennis had been in a verbal altercation with another relative who had been banging on his front door. That relative eventually left, only to be replaced by Bergan who delivered \u201cthe same type of banging,\u201d this time on Dennis\u2019 back door around 11:30 p.m., Johnson said.\n\nDennis, armed with a gun, opened the door and was surprised by Bergan who jumped out at him while making a noise. He was immediately shot in his chest and died instantly. Bergan had previously lived in Florida before moving back to Norway with his wife, who is Dennis\u2019 daughter, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cAnybody who\u2019s religious out there you need to pray for this family because I can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re going through,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe incident came a little more than a month after an Ohio mother shot her 18-year-old daughter in the arm after the teen returned home early from college to surprise her. That mother was also not charged in the incident, which left her daughter briefly hospitalized.\n\n\u201cIf you realize someone has a gun for protection and they\u2019re not expecting you, announce yourself when you enter the home, or even if you\u2019re getting up to get a drink of water in the middle of the night, just announce yourself,\u201d Girard Police Chief John Norman told Youngstown station WFMJ at the time of that shooting.", "description": "Richard Dennis, 62, will not face charges for the shooting that's being called a \"horrible accident.\"", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9a1b6f2000004e004e0630.jpeg?cache=7bo3enc3vf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
