(Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images)\n\nThe ring also features the Toronto skyline, which includes the CN Tower and the team\u2019s \"NORTH\" slogan.\n\nEach player\u2019s jersey number is imprinted in gold around the circumference as well.\n\nThe 1.25 carat diamond at the centre represents the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy and the Raptors\u2019 first NBA title in franchise history.\n\nWhat makes this giant bling uniquely Canadian is a maple leaf at the centre and the 16 red rubies set between the jersey numbers that pay homage to one of Canada\u2019s national colours.\n\nPersonalized rings were made for each of the players who led the team to the championship.\n\nLowry inspired the unique design of the championship ring. (Baron)\n\n\"My hand hurt. It's a little heavy,\" Raptor Fred VanVleet said in an interview courtside after putting the ring on for the first time.\n\n\"I have to start lifting some more weights to carry it around,\" he said.\n\nAnd yes\u2026. Raptors ambassador Drake, who was also involved with the design, got his own ring, too.\n\nDrizzy had a one-off ring made featuring the Raptors\u2019 old dinosaur logo and the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy by celebrity jewelry designer Jason Arasheben.\n\nHe was presented with the ring along with the players and coaches before the tip-off at the Raptors\u2019 opening game last Tuesday.\n\nWhat\u2019s cool is that the nearly 20,000 fans in attendance at Scotiabank Arena all scored replica rings.\n\nFans at last Tuesday night\u2019s game were given $20 replicas for free. (Submitted by Priya Ram)\n\nBut what about the fans who want a real piece of bling on their claws?\n\nWill it break the bank?\n\nWell, that depends on which one you choose.\n\nBaron is selling rings for fans at prices ranging from $225 to $9,995.", "description": "The Toronto Raptors championship ring, inspired by all-star point guard Kyle Lowry, is the biggest in NBA history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/RAPTORS_RING_thumbnail.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
