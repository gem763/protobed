Bitwise\u2019s proposal is still pending (for now) & due for a final decision on October 13. My best guess \u2014 there will be no bitcoin ETF in 2019,\u201d Jake Chervinsky, an attorney who specialized in cryptocurrency, explained in a recent tweet.\n\nVanEck withdrew its bitcoin ETF proposal today, presumably expecting that the SEC would reject it next month.

The market fully priced this reality in a while back. This ETF proposal withdrawal is irrelevant as far as $BTC price goes,\u201d he noted.\n\nOdds of the SEC approving a bitcoin ETF in the foreseeable future have always been extremely low.
