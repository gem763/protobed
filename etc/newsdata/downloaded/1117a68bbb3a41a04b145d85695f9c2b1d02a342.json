He hit into the water on the par-5 16th and made bogey.\n\nHe closed with a 1-under 70.\n\nCantlay lost his late lead with a tee shot in the water on the 17th, and he lost the playoff by missing a par putt from just under 6 feet.\n\nKevin Na tees off on the third hole during the final round of Shriners Hospitals for Children Open golf tournament Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019, in Las Vegas.
