They both lost their first game last week to formidable opponents.\n\nBut the Cowboys are a young team destined for years of contention, while the Packers and Aaron Rodgers are just hoping to prove they can still be relevant.\n\nQuarterback Battle: Aaron Rodgers vs. Dak Prescott\n\nDak Prescott is trying to sprint past Aaron Rodgers as the top-dog quarterback in the NFC. So far this year, he\u2019s doing just that. Prescott leads Rodgers in completion rate (72% to 62%), touchdowns (9 to 6), and quarterback rating (113.7 to 95.4).\n\nBut don\u2019t count out the Green Bay veteran yet. Yes, Rodgers is 36 years old, and no, not every quarterback can be stellar into their 40s like Tom Brady. But Rodgers is one of the best quarterbacks of all-time. He lit up the Philadelphia Eagles secondary last week for 422 yards. Although he did throw the game-deciding interception, it was his first and only interception of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, Prescott stunk it up against the Saints, throwing zero touchdowns and one interception in a loss to the Drew Brees-less Saints. Rodgers could easily step into his greatness this Sunday and remind the league why he has the highest career passer rating of all-time.\n\nDefense Wins Championships (And Regular Season Games Too)\n\nGreen Bay is 3-1 \u2013 despite Aaron Rodgers playing like a mere mortal \u2013 because their defense is finally clicking. They rank tenth in yards allowed per game and third in passing yards allowed. The problem is, the defense in Dallas is even better.\n\nThe Cowboys rank seventh in yards allowed per game. They\u2019ve only allowed 96.8 rushing yards-per-game this year while Green Bay has given up a whopping 142.2 rushing yards on average. With one of the top young running backs in the league in Ezekiel Elliott, Dallas will look to control this game on the ground.\n\nThe Injury Bug Is Biting\n\nUnfortunately, injuries might be the most significant factor in this matchup. As of Thursday, a whopping 14 starters were listed as questionable or out between the two teams.\n\nDallas all-pro left tackle Tyron Smith is listed as out, while two other starting offensive linemen are listed as questionable. That could make it tough on Dak Prescott as Green Bay\u2019s pass rush will look to take advantage.\n\nHowever, Green Bay will have a hard time capitalizing if their defense is equally hobbled. Top linebacker Blake Martinez, who\u2019s the second-leading tackler in the NFL, is listed as questionable. Top cornerback Kevin King is also questionable, as are two other defensive starters.\n\nAdd on to that the disconcerting fact that the Packers\u2019 premier wide receiver, Davante Adams, has yet to partake in even a light practice with a turf toe injury.\n\nPrediction: Cowboys 27, Packers 20\n\nAaron Rodgers will truly have to be great to capture this victory. Dallas has the edge in rushing, defense, and, for the time being, passing. They also have home-field advantage and fewer critical injuries.\n\nThe Cowboys are 3.5 point favorites to win this game, but they\u2019ll likely cover the spread and expose the gap between the Packers and the NFC\u2019s elite.\n\nKickoff is at 4:25 pm ET on Sunday, and the game will be broadcast on Fox.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/aaron-rodgers-packers-afp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
