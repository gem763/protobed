These are often family members who live in the country of their birth.\n\nHowever, paradoxically, despite the results from the ComRes survey of more than 8,000 British adults, there is a significant shortage of BAME adopters.", "description": "White families are half as likely to consider adoption as their ethnic minority counterparts, a study has found.", "authors": ["Gabriella Swerling", "Social", "Religious Affairs Editor", "William Hague"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2016/06/14/Newborns-taken-into-care-NEWS-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
