These decorative pins may be thought of as an antiquated accessory to some, but can also be used as a subtle way to wield authority; a lowkey power move.\n\nSometimes, they can even communicate a secret message or statement, like the time former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wore a snake pin after the Iraqi media called her an \u201cunparalleled serpent.\u201d Or in 2018, when Queen Elizabeth famously wore a series of brooches during a visit from Donald Trump, including one gifted to her from the Obamas, that some believed were an expression of her disapproval of the US president. And, if you\u2019ve ever seen the movie Don\u2019t Tell Mom the Babysitter\u2019s Dead, you\u2019ve more than likely appreciated the brooch game of boss lady, Rose \u201cI\u2019m right on top of that, Rose\u201d Lindsey.\n\nWell, I\u2019m happy to report that another brooch queen has arrived in our lives, and she, too, may be trying to tell us something through her glamorous pin\n\ncollection. On Tuesday, the president of the UK Supreme Court, Lady Brenda Hale, announced that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament was ruled as unlawful. While this was monumental news to the country, it was hard not to notice Lady Hale\u2019s stunning accessory of choice: a giant, rhinestone spider.\n\nVIDEO: U.K. Supreme Court President Brenda Hale announces the unanimous judgment against Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament.

(One user pointed out a song from The Who called \u201cBoris the Spider,\u201d while another referenced a children\u2019s book about a spider named Boris who \u201ccauses as much trouble as he can in the house.\u201d) Though, while that would be very on the nose, it is an interesting theory.\n\ngive Lady Hale and her giant spider brooch a statue you cowards \u2014 Kirsty Strickland (@KirstyStricklan) September 24, 2019\n\nIf her arachnid accessory is not some kind of secret message, perhaps Lady Hale might just be a Fall Goth who wanted to wear a spooky accessory to celebrate the Autumnal Equinox. Maybe she simply lives for a theme! One thing is for sure, Lady Hale is no brooch novice, as she is known to wear them often, particularly those shaped like insects and other creatures.\n\nAbove all, I think it\u2019s safe to say we can all respect a woman who has no qualms about spicing up an otherwise mundane setting \u2014 like a stuffy courtroom \u2014 with a fabulous, diamant\u00e9 brooch.\n\nStay in touch.
