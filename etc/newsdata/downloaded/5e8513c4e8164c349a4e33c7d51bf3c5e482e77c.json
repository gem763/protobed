If he knows what is going on, why doesn't he, as a government minister, do something about it?\n\nWithin The Liberal Democrats (which isn't saying much) he commands more respect than Nick Clegg. Clearly, he wants the leadership but hesitates before doing anything as honourable as making an open bid for it.\n\nDr Cable has had experience in the business world, which is more than can be said of Dave, George, Ed and Nick, mere striplings all of them. But has he made any valuable use of it? Or are his current posturings on the sins of bankers and newspaper proprietors merely grandstandings, playing to the sandalled gallery?\n\nOur country is looking into the abyss of social disintegration, Euro-meltdown and Middle East war. But The Liberal Democrats, with or without Vince Cable at the helm, would steer us straight onto the rocks. Wind farms won't provide the economic power to restore our national economic health and avoid catastrophe.\n\nDr Cable should follow his natural instincts by resigning his Cabinet post, standing for the leadership of his party on a ticket of leaving the Coalition, and then returning to the position of total irrelevance that he occupied so comfortably before.", "description": "DR ROBERT LEFEVER: Dr Cable should resign from his Cabinet post, standing for the leadership and then returning to the position that he occupied before", "authors": ["Dr Robert Lefever For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/24/article-2178204-13FCB6F4000005DC-908_1024x615_large.jpg", "published_at": "2012-07-24"}
