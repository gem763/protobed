The actress is seen last December above\n\n'I remember, right when [his ex-wife] Georgina's clothing line Marchesa was starting. That's when he came to visit me in London while we were shooting,' Aniston told the paper.\n\n'He'd be like, \"OK, so I'd like you to wear one of these to the premiere.\" And I went through the book, and at the time, it wasn't what it is today. It was not for me.\n\nWeistein wouldn't take no for an answer.\n\nJen went on: 'He was like, \"You have to wear the dress.\" That was my only bullying. And I was like, \"No, I will not wear the dress.\"'\n\nThe ex of Brad Pitt didn't end up wearing one of the frocks, reasoning: 'Well, what was he going to do? Come over here and make me wear it?!'\n\n'Not for me:' 'He'd be like, \"OK, so I'd like you to wear one of these to the premiere.\" And I went through the book, and at the time, it wasn't what it is today. Above Weistein and Chapman are seen in 2017\n\nNot her style: Above a Marchesa design from 2013 is seen\n\nWhile Jen admitted that was the only time Weinstein directly 'bullied' her, she also remembered the producer's poor behavior at Derailed's debut.\n\n'There was the premiere dinner. I remember I was sitting at the dinner table with Clive [Owen], and our producers and a friend of mine was sitting with me,' she told Variety.\n\n'And he literally came to the table and said to my friend: \"Get up!\" And I was like, \"Oh my gosh.\" And so my friend got up and moved and Harvey sat down. It was just such a level of gross entitlement and piggish behavior.'\n\nScandalous: Jennifer's latest project The Morning Show touches on the #MeToo movement as it follows the fall out from a fictitious scandal. The series also stars Steve Carell and Reese Witherspoon\n\nThough Jennifer was lucky to escape any further Weinstein drama, her latest project The Morning Show touches on the #MeToo movement as it follows the fall out from a fictitious scandal.\n\nThe Apple TV drama picks up as Aniston's AM co-host, played by Steve Carell, is fired over sexual misconduct allegations. Reese Witherspoon also stars as an aspiring journalist, gunning for Aniston's job.\n\nBut she revealed the #MeToo elements weren't originally in the story.\n\n'The show got picked up. We sold it to Apple with an outline. Then, about four months later, the whole s**t hit the fan and, basically, we had to start from scratch,' she told the magazine.\n\nThe Morning Show will start streaming November 1 2019.", "description": "Aniston wasn't afraid to talk about how\u00a0Weinstein's manipulative behavior during the production of his company's Derailed in 2005.
