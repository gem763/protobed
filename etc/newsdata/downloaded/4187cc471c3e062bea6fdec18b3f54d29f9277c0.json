Shares dropped to $34.44 following news to shareholders of the company's disappointing quarter.\n\nIts shareholder letter also cited \"bugs\" affecting its targeted ad capabilities that \"share data with measurement and ad partners\", the company said. Ad engagements increased 23 per cent, but the cost per engagement dropped 12 per cent.\n\nThose \"bugs\" include the company's collection of device data from users that it wasn't supposed to be targeting, then using that data for targeted ads. Twitter's Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said that the product's settings were \"not working as expected\" for that feature.\n\nThe company stopped collecting that user information in August and shut down the feature entirely, which the company believes hurt its overall ad picture.\n\nUser data also was still being collected even after they believe they had opted out of a feature that asked them if Twitter could use device-specific settings to personalise their timeline.\n\nAddressing third-quarter results on CNBC, Mr Segal said the company feels \"really good about the progress\" it's making but intends to hold itself accountable for user privacy issues and other product concerns.\n\nThe company said it added 6 million new daily active users in the third quarter, up to 145 million, marking a 17 per cent increase from the previous year and a 4 per cent jump from the second quarter.\n\nAmong Twitter's recent product updates include an ability for users to follow topics, not just individual accounts, an experiment it will continue into 2020 in an effort to retain its millions of users and attract new ones while climbing back from revenue shortfalls\n\nRead more\n\nTwitter stops working as users told 'something went wrong'\n\nMitt Romney admits to being a 'lurker' with secretive Twitter account\n\nWhy won\u2019t Twitter ban Donald Trump?
