It may be about to get worse.", "language": "en", "text": "See a pattern here? I do. Two division rivals, who barely noticed the Redskins were on their schedule, woke up when they got behind, grabbed the Redskins by the throat, smacked them around, outcoached them by miles at halftime and named the score. Washington dink-and-dunked its way to a meaningless late score to save face \u2014 a little.\n\nThe offensive line, without alienated holdout tackle Trent Williams, can\u2019t open a hole for anybody. Derrius Guice gained 18 yards last week against the Eagles and was injured. Adrian Peterson gained 25 yards against the Cowboys. That is as bad of back-to-back rushing games as this franchise has ever seen.\n\nNow we know that neither a young prospect nor an aging Hall of Famer can gain much more than a body\u2019s length per carry behind this group. But the line still had its weekly pair of holding penalties.\n\nThe Redskins will tell you, even after their second straight loss Sunday, that they are a good team, a playoff contender and, just you watch, once they get a few glitches cleaned up and some injured players return, they will be a force, and your eyes will be glued to them.\n\n\u201cWe [only] played two games, and [we\u2019ve] got to keep [issues] in-house and stay together. A lot of people are going to try to tear us apart . . . and deservedly so, probably,\u201d Coach Jay Gruden said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve played two very good football teams. . . . We have a young team that\u2019s going to develop and grow. We need veterans to step up and take this team by the throat. I think it will happen. I still feel very optimistic about the future of this football team.\u201d\n\nSvrluga: The Redskins\u2019 defense was supposed to be the strength of the team. It\u2019s not.\n\nGruden also mentioned, but did not emphasize, that his team was without four core players \u2014 tight end Jordan Reed, defensive tackle Jonathan Allen and a pair of cornerbacks \u2014 not to mention Williams, the best player on the team.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to hit the panic button yet,\u201d Gruden said.\n\nThis Redskins team should not have a panic button to start with \u2014 it\u2019s not good enough to have one. Panic buttons are for playoff contenders who fail to deliver. They are not for teams that lost a good starting quarterback last year in Alex Smith and replaced him with a lesser, placeholder passer in likable Case Keenum. Panic buttons are not for teams that should be patient in developing a promising rookie quarterback such as Dwayne Haskins.\n\nFor heaven\u2019s sake, who would press the panic button just because astronomically paid Josh Norman was beaten on a 51-yard touchdown bomb down the middle Sunday? Opponents have been picking on Norman for two years. He goes along with the Daniel Snyder-world drill that he\u2019s a star in an inexplicable slump.\n\nIn some alternate universe, the Redskins are a team that is just waiting to get healthy and get hot.\n\nReality check: That\u2019s not happening.\n\nThis team knew it wasn\u2019t built to play from behind. Now we see it can\u2019t play from ahead. This team knew it wasn\u2019t built to win if it lost the turnover battle. Now it hasn\u2019t committed a single turnover in its first two games and is winless. Washington even got an interception against Dallas. What happens to this team when it has an NFL-normal number of turnovers? What happens when it gets behind early?\n\nThe kindest thing you can do for this team is lower the expectations that surround it. The coaches and players have to say all the usual upbeat things \u2014 doubly so with the brass listening. One rookie, leave him nameless, said: \u201cWe have 14 games left. Maybe we run the table!\u201d\n\nThe NFL puts out a schedule of all games every year. You\u2019re allowed to look at it ahead of time. The schedule I\u2019m looking at says the Redskins will be fortunate to win two games out of the seven they have remaining with true contenders: the Chicago Bears (next Monday night), New England Patriots, San Francisco 49ers and Eagles at FedEx Field, plus the Minnesota Vikings, Green Bay Packers and Cowboys on the road.\n\nA couple of ex-Redskins have issues to settle in those games, too: The 49ers are coached by Kyle Shanahan, and quarterback Kirk Cousins will be waiting in Minneapolis.\n\nToo many near-misses doom the Redskins in a frustrating loss to the Cowboys\n\nAside from the tanking Miami Dolphins, Washington has no game in which it will be more than a tiny favorite. Maybe the Redskins will split their six games with the New York Giants (home and away), New York Jets, Buffalo Bills, Detroit Lions and Carolina Panthers.\n\nThat\u2019s five or six wins. It\u2019s what pundits nationwide have said, except those who said, \u201cThree or four.\u201d\n\nOf course, huge numbers of Washington fans already know this and have been factoring it into their thinking \u2014 and game-day habits. On a glorious, warm afternoon, FedEx Field had its usual thousands of empty seats, but thanks to Cowboys fans who made up perhaps 35 percent of the house, there was plenty of noise.\n\n\u201c[The Cowboys] had a lot of fans out there. . . . They definitely brought the house,\u201d second-year defensive lineman Tim Settle said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. Guys go down. We have a lot of young guys. We have to stay strong. It\u2019s part of the game. . . . Keep pushing. Stay by each other\u2019s side. We got time.\u201d\n\nThat is probably the right attitude for this team \u2014 realistic and patient, waiting for progress. But when has this franchise ever been realistic and patient? Every time Gruden or a veteran player cites an honest, obvious reason something went wrong, they immediately add: \u201cThat\u2019s no excuse. We have to play better.\u201d\n\nBetter than they are capable of playing? That\u2019s a lot to ask.\n\nAs the weather turns colder and the Redskins\u2019 record probably gets quite chilly, lots of decisions will be made by fans on whether this team is worth their time and affection.\n\nOn Sunday morning, I explained this dilemma to my wife, using Williams as an illustration. The fans are like Williams, I said. They dislike the way the team is run so much that they don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. Williams is refusing to play to force a trade. Fans would rather do their gardening than go to games or watch on TV.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t malign gardening,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more on the Washington Redskins:\n\nThree takeaways from Redskins\u2019 31-21 loss to the Cowboys\n\nThe key moments from Redskins\u2019 31-21 loss to the Cowboys in home opener\n\nTerry McLaurin spent his college days preparing for the unexpected.
