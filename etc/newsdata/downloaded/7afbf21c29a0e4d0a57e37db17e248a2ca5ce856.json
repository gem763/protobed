They edited down quite a lot of what Howie said and I\u2019m gonna be completely honest with you, I don\u2019t think a lot of it was necessary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That\u2019s all because I don\u2019t mind criticism, and certain things didn\u2019t work but certain things did and there was a lot of positives there, but A, he talked for ages and B, it was negative, negative, negative.\u2019\n\nBrendan was a little softer, adding: \u2018Luckily, Nicole and Simon were really nice to us.\u2019\n\nHowie Mandel tore Jeremy and Brendan apart (Picture: NBC Universal)\n\nJeremy has slammed Howie and gone in (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018And Louis was nice,\u2019 Jeremy agreed. \u2018At one point I wanted to say, \u201cdude, you\u2019re not even a judge so can you shut up. It only matters what these three say\u201d.\u2019\n\nAlthough, the former Holby City actor is taking it all in his stride, kind of.\n\n\u2018You know what, I was if I\u2019m being completely honest. [Me and Brendan] possibly have the least amount of experience but we are learning at an incredible rate which makes it exciting to see where we\u2019re gonna go,\u2019 he stressed.\n\n\u2018We didn\u2019t come on the show to be as good as everyone else,\u2019 Brendan added. \u2018Next week there is some phenomenal singing on the airways! We didn\u2019t come in to be the best singers, that\u2019s apparent, but all of us have got something about us. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been in our different careers for so many years.\n\n\u2018Hopefully that energy will come across on stage should we get the opportunity to go through to the live show.\u2019\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity kicks off tonight at 8.35pm on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
