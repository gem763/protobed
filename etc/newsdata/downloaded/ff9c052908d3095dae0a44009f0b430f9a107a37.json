Positions have changed a little bit so I think I can contest him right now.\"\n\nThe seventh-ranked Tsitsipas, who dumped out defending champion Djokovic in three sets on Friday, said that Medvedev's formidable serve had been the difference.\n\n\"Same vibes, same thing all over again,\" said Tsitsipas of yet another defeat to the red-hot Russian. \"I don't mean to be rude at all, but it's just boring.\n\n\"It's so boring that I hate myself for putting myself into that kind of situation where I have to play in his own terms and not in my terms.\"\n\nSixth-ranked Zverev, long touted as the man most likely to join the \"Big Three\" of Federer, Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, has had a disappointing year, winning only one title.\n\nBut the German defeated 20-time Grand Slam champion Federer on Friday and took that momentum into his last-four clash with the 23-year-old Berrettini.\n\nThe Italian, 13th in the world, put up a better fight in the second set but was broken in the ninth game as his hopes of an upset faded.\n\nZverev said the victory over Federer had given him a major confidence boost.\n\nBut he said that past meetings with Medvedev stood for nothing because the Russian has improved markedly since their last match, in 2018.\n\n\"He's different this year than previous years,\" said a wary Zverev. \"He's been playing some unbelievable tennis in the last few months.\n\n\"He's probably the best player in the world, making six finals in a row, winning a Masters (in Cincinnati in August) and making the U.S. Open final. He's definitely playing the best tennis of his life.\"\n\nNadal, the world number two and winner over Medvedev at Flushing Meadows, is not in Shanghai because of a wrist injury.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Dominant Daniil Medvedev reached a staggering sixth final in a row but will need to beat Alexander Zverev for the first time to win the Shanghai Masters on Sunday.
