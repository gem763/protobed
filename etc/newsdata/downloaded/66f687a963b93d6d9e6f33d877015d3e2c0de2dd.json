Ardent Warren fans can proclaim their affection in hundreds of combinations, and more than a few niches. There\u2019s a coffee cup which reads, \u201cI like my coffee like I like my unions: strong,\u201d and a onesie that advises to \u201cDream big. Fight hard. Nap often.\u201d But one of the most frequently recurring taglines across the campaign merchandise is, as one might expect, \u201cWarren has a plan for that.\u201d\n\nThe phrase, while not an official campaign slogan, has become the most common and recognizable calling card for Warren supporters. Like any good meme, it began online, filtered onto the campaign\u2019s Twitter account, into the candidate\u2019s stump speeches, and onto handmade signs, reinforcing her formidable brand as the candidate who has a plan for everything.\n\n\n\nAt present, Warren\u2019s website contains more than 50 relatively detailed policy plans\u2014chances are, she does have a plan for that, whatever \u201cthat\u201d may be. But as far as campaign taglines go, \u201cShe Has a Plan For That\u201d is a disappointing entry that pinches at the nerve of reservation that some on the left have regarding Warren\u2019s rise in popularity. It\u2019s a technocratic rallying cry, one that romanticizes the idea of having ideas rather than celebrating any central ethos within the ideas themselves. What\u2019s worse, it implicitly lulls its reader or listener into a false sense of security, assuring them that they needn\u2019t be too critical or discerning, since someone has already done the work for them. And there is considerable work left to be done to bring any one of Warren\u2019s litany of ideas to fruition.\n\nFor a campaign slogan to be effective, it must tick a number of boxes. First, it has to offer a broad-strokes pitch about the candidate\u2019s ideology or political approach. Next, it should respond to or preempt the alternative messages being offered to voters. Finally, it must situate the candidate as a part of a larger coalition or movement. \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d the ubiquitous slogan of President Trump, succeeds in hitting all three of these points\u2014with particular attention to ideological signaling. In four words, Trump stokes nostalgia and resentment in equal measure by combining a biting truth (that America is not, in fact, great) with a fantasy (that it ever was). In half that number, President Obama catalyzed optimism in the electorate with his 2008 dual slogans, \u201cHope\u201d and \u201cChange.\u201d\n\n", "description": "It may sound comforting in the Trump era, but it's unconvincing as a mission statement.", "authors": ["Rachel Hawley"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/42c3b9e82f84d9652cc08f391c0aff4b9ae2a1df.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
