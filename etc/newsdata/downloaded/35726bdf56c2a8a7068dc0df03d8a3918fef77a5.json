A source with knowledge of the events said that when prison staff visited the woman\u2019s cell on Friday morning the baby was unresponsive.\n\nVicky Robinson, the director at HMP Bronzefield, confirmed that a baby died at the prison last Friday and said it was supporting the mother.\n\nSouth East Coast Ambulance Service confirmed it had received a call from the prison at 8.30am last Friday and that one ambulance attended the prison. Police were called shortly afterwards.\n\nSurrey police said in a statement: \u201cThe death is currently being treated as unexplained and an investigation is continuing to establish the full circumstances of what happened.\u201d\n\nThe case raises serious questions about how the woman came to be unsupervised and without medical support during her labour and birth, and about the conditions at the privately run prison.\n\nRobinson said: \u201cWe are supporting the mother through this distressing time and our thoughts are with her, her family and our staff involved. We are undertaking a full review and working with all relevant authorities during their investigations. It would not be appropriate to comment any further.\u201d\n\nBronzefield is Europe\u2019s largest female prison, holding up to 557 inmates, and is operated by Sodexo Justice Services. Concerns have been raised previously about the care of prisoners, including pregnant women.\n\nIn one case highlighted last year, Petruta-Cristina Bosoanca was held at Bronzefield on trafficking charges while she was pregnant. She said she was forced to give birth alone in her prison cell in 2017. Subsequently, the criminal case against her collapsed and she was released.\n\nIn the case of Natasha Chin, who died at HMP Bronzefield in 2016, an inquest jury found that neglect and systemic failings at the prison had contributed to her death. Four women have died at Bronzefield since July 2016.\n\nThere is a mother and baby unit at the prison and women whose babies are born in prison, or who already have a baby when they enter prison, can keep the infants with them until they are 18 months old.\n\nEvery year, about 600 pregnant women are held in prisons in England and Wales, and about 100 babies are born there.\n\nAccording to the Prison Reform Trust, women made up 5% of the prison population in 2018 with 7,745 women incarcerated. The majority of them, 82%, were sentenced for non-violent offences.\n\nNaomi Delap, the director of the charity Birth Companions, which supports pregnant women and new mothers in prison, said: \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the report of this incident in prison custody. Our thoughts are with the mother and all those affected by this tragic event. While the circumstances are still unclear and subject to ongoing investigation, this is a powerful reminder of the need for us to all ensure that pregnant and postnatal women have access to high-quality physical and mental healthcare in custody.\u201d\n\nJane Ryan, a solicitor at Bhatt Murphy Solicitors who specialises in cases of women in prison, said: \u201cThere are serious concerns raised about risk issues arising from lack of access to midwives when labour commences, access to pregnancy records and full maternity care. It is an indictment of our prison system that a woman was giving birth in a prison cell. There must be a full independent investigation, and possibly an inquest, into these horrific circumstances.\u201d\n\nDr Kate Paradine, the chief executive of the charity Women in Prison, said: \u201cAll mothers should have the right to give birth in dignity. But time and time again, we hear of situations where this isn\u2019t happening, with mothers regularly being denied access to the vital health and maternity care necessary to give birth safely. This has devastating consequences not only for the baby and mother, but also for the rest of the family they are separated from.\u201d", "description": "Police investigate unexplained death at Bronzefield women\u2019s prison in Surrey", "authors": ["Hannah Devlin", "Diane Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7a544b64a366763e1b0bcad1adbecb3688431b9/180_0_2191_1314/master/2191.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e1d1054b60a34a110bae58f26181e771", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
