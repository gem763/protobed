I had to do it.\"\n\nTwo other Gunners players were chasing back, but were behind Zaha at the point of Guendouzi's contact.\n\nWhether he would have made it the 40-odd yards to Arsenal's area without being challenged is unknown, but Palace boss Roy Hodgson was unimpressed with the referee's decision.\n\n\"There\u2019s no way he wanted to cause any harm,\" Hodgson said.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"He just wanted to stop Zaha getting free because they wouldn\u2019t have caught him and it would have been a case of can he convert one-on-one.\n\n\"I think he is quite lucky he got the yellow card, some might say it was a red, but that\u2019s of no interest to me.\n\n\"I\u2019m just disappointed Wilf didn\u2019t get chance to win the game for us.\"\n\nArsenal had already let a two-goal lead slip against Palace, while captain Granit Xhaka was booed off by his own fans after being substituted.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHowever Gunners legend Ian Wright called on the Swiss international to apologise to the club's fans after he swore at them on his way off the field before removing his shirt and walking down the tunnel.\n\n\"Players getting booed is not the best, but this is the captain,\" Wright said.\n\n\"They are frustrated that he hasn't run off the pitch. I've seen him before bolt off when he's substituted. He's walked off and then he goads them.\n\n\"We're talking about fans who have watched him play a handful of good games in three years. And he's treating them like that.\"", "description": "The Frenchman halted Zaha's route to goal in injury time of the clash between the sides at the Emirates", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743195.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Arsenal-v-Crystal-Palace.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
