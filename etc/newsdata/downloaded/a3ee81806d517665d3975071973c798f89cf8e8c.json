He went on to say Pelosi is wasting time with a \u201cmanufactured crisis.\u201d\n\nApproving the new deal \u2014 known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) \u2014 before the end of the year has been one of the administration\u2019s top priorities.\n\n\u201cIf it happens, it happens. Otherwise, when we take over the House next year we\u2019ll do it our way,\u201d said Trump.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the White House said Democratic lawmakers have \u201cdestroyed any chances\u201d of legislative progress with the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThey need to have an internal discussion at the White House about how they want to play it. Do you to want keep working with the Democrats or are you so mad that you don't want to work with them on anything? And I don't know if they decided that yet,\u201d said Simon Lester, trade expert with the Cato Institute.\n\nIn contrast to Trump, Lighthizer appears to more optimistic about the deal\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cIf it did not pass, it would be a catastrophe for our economy,\u201d Lighthizer told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nLighthizer said he\u2019s confident the agreement will make it through Congress, despite the inquiry, because he believes it\u2019s a good deal.\n\n\n\n\"It's not all about politics in Washington. On the merits, this is demonstrably good for the people of the United States,\u201d said Lighthizer, according to the White House press pool report.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer leaves after a meeting with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., May 15, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst More\n\nA group of Democratic lawmakers has been working with Lighthizer for months, attempting to make changes to several areas of the deal \u2014 including environmental standards, labor standards, pharmaceuticals and enforcement. Democratic lawmakers insist they can still work on the trade deal, while investigating President Trump.\n\n\u201cThe work continues between the administration and the leadership with the House. There\u2019s still progress going on,\u201d said Rep. Dan Kildee (D-MI) in an interview with Yahoo Finance. \u201cTo be fair, there are some good people in the federal government \u2014 people like Ambassador Lighthizer, who is the person with whom we're working on this \u2014 that want to get this done, is acting in good faith.\u201d\n\nKildee said he\u2019s not sure if Democratic negotiators and Lighthizer will eventually come up with an agreement that he could support, but the impeachment inquiry won\u2019t stop them from trying.\n\n\u201cI don't think it's necessarily the end of USMCA. I think USMCA has bigger problems, unfortunately, than this [impeachment] and it's actually getting the language right,\u201d said Kildee, who serves on the House Ways & Means committee.\n\nIsaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point, said President Trump\u2019s negotiating style makes it difficult to predict what will happen.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, the inquiry could fortify President Trump\u2019s trade stance as he tends to retrench and redirect when attacked,\u201d said Boltansky in a note. \u201cOn the other hand, the inquiry could cause the president to look for victories beyond the water\u2019s edge to bolster his case for reelection. We tend to believe that the president\u2019s posture will reflect the former in the near-term, but expect him to pivot toward the latter strategy as the election draws near.\u201d\n\nAt a press conference Wednesday afternoon, a reporter asked President Trump if he would end NAFTA if USMCA doesn\u2019t make it through Congress.\n\n\u201cI don't want to answer that question, but you know how I feel about NAFTA. I think NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna find out. That\u2019s going to be a very interesting question.\u201d", "description": "President Trump raised concerns that Congress may not approve the new North American Free Trade Agreement, now that the House has launched an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Jessica Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gzNB6XfT_trGKz.YEwFu0g--~B/aD0xNjIwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2018-11/3a1d6f80-f4ac-11e8-abfd-00af0485b420", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
