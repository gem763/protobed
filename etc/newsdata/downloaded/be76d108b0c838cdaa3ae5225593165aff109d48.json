That fact is clear, but explaining why the world\u2019s largest digital currency has lost momentum in the second half of the year is anything but.\n\nSome, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. have pointed to Intercontinental Exchange Inc.\u2019s new futures contracts and an unwinding of long positions as likely culprits for the nosedive. Others have pointed to a buildup of technical bearish signals as setting off its summer swoon.\n\nIndexica, an alternative data provider, has a different take. According to their predictive index built on data from Aug. 1 through Oct. 1, Bitcoin\u2019s fall has less to do with the currency itself and more to do with a growing cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nAccording to their latest findings, Bitcoin\u2019s price moves are being driven by competing digital currencies and new blockchain technologies. Indexica\u2019s study showed talk around Mastercard\u2019s partnership with R3 to develop a new blockchain payment system as a strong driver of recent returns.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nZak Selbert, chief executive officer at Indexica, says Bitcoin\u2019s sensitivity to the development of competitors is just another sign of a coming of age. In a new development, Indexica found that Bitcoin\u2019s strongest predictive measure was its \u201cquoteability,\u201d which showed that it was most often talked about in conjunction with more traditional currencies.\n\n\u201cNow that Bitcoin is a big kid, anything can make it move, just like anything can make gold or a G-10 currency move,\u201d said Selbert. \u201cBitcoin is part of the financial landscape in a very intertwined and mature way.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Brandon Kochkodin in New York at bkochkodin@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeremy Herron at jherron8@bloomberg.net, Dave Liedtka, Randall Jensen\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin has plunged more than 30% since hitting a year-to-date high.
