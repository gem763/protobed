It was about helping the Ukrainians get graft out and corruption outside of their government and to help now this new government in the Ukraine build a successful, thriving economy.\"\n\n\"It's been what State Department officials that I have had the privilege to lead have been engaged in, and it's what we will continue to do even while all this noise is going on,\" he said.\n\nVolker resigned abruptly from the special envoy position last Friday after Giuliani suggested the department was well aware of his efforts to get Ukraine to open a corruption probe into former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter.\n\nPompeo is under increasing scrutiny from House Democrats leading impeachment proceedings against Trump. On Tuesday, he pushed back on House demands for interviews with State Department officials about the administration's dealings with Ukraine that are at the center of the inquiry.\n\nPompeo defended his response to the House committee chairmen, who have suggested that Pompeo's participation in the Trump-Zelenskiy call should require him to recuse himself from decisions on how to deal with Congress.\n\nPompeo asserted that House investigators contacted \"State Department employees directly\" and told them not to contact State Department lawyers for advice. He said the State Department would \"do our constitutional duty to cooperate\" with Congress but wouldn't tolerate \"bullying and intimidation.\"\n\n\"We will of course do our constitutional duty to cooperate with this co-equal branch, but we are going to do so in a way that is consistent with the fundamental values of the American system,\" Pompeo said. \"And we won't tolerate folks on Capitol Hill bullying and intimidating State Department employees. That's unacceptable, and it's not something that I'm going to permit to happen.\"\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Pompeo criticized governments that wield absolute power as threats to religious freedom, telling a conference at the Vatican on human dignity and faith that when governments hold all the power, religion is a threat.\n\n\"When the state rules absolutely, human dignity is trampled, not cherished,\" he said. \"When the state rules absolutely, moral norms are crushed completely. When the state rules absolutely, it demands its citizens worship government, not God.\"\n\nHe cited China, Cuba, Iran, Myanmar and Syria in particular for repressing religious freedom.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
