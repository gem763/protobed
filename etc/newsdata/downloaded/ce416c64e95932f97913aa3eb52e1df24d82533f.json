My balances of almost \u00a325,000 have been wiped clean by the bank, without notice. All my transactions are normal, but now I am left with no money.\n\nI receive letters like yours quite often. If a bank suspects a customer of money laundering, it must freeze the account. This does not mean the money is lost, but it is temporarily blocked.\n\nThat\u2019s what I thought had happened, but your own experience is more serious. The National Crime Agency uncovered evidence that you and other current or former overseas students at British universities were laundering criminal cash from China.\n\n'It has the stink of money laundering and the NCA was completely right to take action', says Tony Hetherington\n\nNCA investigators won a court order to freeze 95 bank accounts holding about \u00a33.6million \u2013 rather more than you might expect to be held by students or recent graduates.\n\nMore than a dozen pages of evidence about your own accounts highlight three deposits at a bank in Wood Green in London: \u00a34,000, another \u00a34,000, and then \u00a33,560. These separate deposits were made in cash over the space of seven minutes.\n\nFour days later, there were three separate cash deposits in less than 30 minutes at a bank in Knightsbridge, totalling \u00a38,000. And two days after that, more than \u00a33,000 in cash was deposited at a bank in Canary Wharf.\n\nOn the day those deposits were made in Wood Green, your debit card was used repeatedly in Gibraltar and you have confirmed to me that you were there.\n\nYou have told me that the cash deposits in London were made by a currency exchange firm that turned Chinese funds into sterling, though why the firm would make multiple cash deposits just minutes apart is unexplained.\n\nIt has the stink of money laundering and the NCA was completely right to take action.", "description": "I have had my Barclays accounts since 2014, when I was a student, before moving to Gibraltar.
