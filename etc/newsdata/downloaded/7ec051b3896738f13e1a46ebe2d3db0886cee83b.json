They also fret that the two other top-ranking candidates, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), are too liberal to win a general election. Other candidates have had moments to shine, but none yet have fully transformed that into anything approaching momentum.\n\nOprah Winfrey, an early backer of Barack Obama who was initially enthusiastic about former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, has repeatedly begged Disney chief executive Bob Iger to jump into the race. Hillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can imagine much stronger candidates,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a Democratic National Committee member. She pines for Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who declined to run, or an outsider such as retired Adm. William H. McRaven, who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nJohn Coale, a major donor to both Bill and Hillary Clinton, was more blunt. \u201cThey don\u2019t have anybody who can win the general [election],\u201d he said.\n\nIn conversations with 17 state and national party leaders, nearly all expressed some level of unease with where the field stands and a deepening concern that, even as Trump suffers through one of the darkest phases of his presidency, the leading presidential contenders would struggle mightily in a one-on-one contest with him. For all of his challenges, Trump commands a gigantic operation that has vacuumed up unprecedented sums of money, an unparalleled megaphone to lure in voters and a lock on most of the Republican Party. Democrats face the possibility of a long primary fight that could cleave the party along ideological and generational lines and leave the nominee campaigning against an incumbent whom Democrats see as simultaneously weak and hard to beat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe unpredictable nature of the race so far has contributed to Democrats\u2019 unease. Candidates who at first seemed to combine crowd-pleasing star power with center-left appeal, such as O\u2019Rourke and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), faded quickly. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has commanded attention on the debate stage but been unable to appeal to black voters, a concern underscored Tuesday by a leaked memo detailing a focus group of black South Carolina voters who expressed discomfort with him being gay.\n\nOthers moderates, such as Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) and Gov. Steve Bullock (Mont.), linger toward the bottom of the polls.\n\nThat has helped propel speculation about Hillary Clinton, the 2016 party nominee, although aides say the likelihood of her seeking a rematch with Trump remains slim. Those close to Clinton, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on her behalf, say she has felt vindicated over the past few weeks as Trump\u2019s political difficulties have deepened. That sentiment was reinforced this week when the State Department announced its probe into emails sent to a private server, a major complication of her 2016 campaign, found no evidence of deliberate mishandling of classified information by department employees .\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s unlikely she would do it,\u201d said one person who has spoken with her. \u201cBut put it this way: It ain\u2019t zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nAllies have passed around an op-ed that appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle, written by former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown, with the headline, \u201cWho should run against Trump? How about Hillary Clinton?\u201d\n\nSupporters say she has been glued to the Democratic primary contest and has spoken with some frequency with Warren and Biden, among others. Now selling a book written with her daughter, Chelsea, she has been a constant public presence of late, engaging in a days-long spat with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and repeatedly trolling Trump on his favorite communications platform, Twitter.\n\nAD\n\nA late entrance under any circumstances would be difficult, with Clinton\u2019s former aides and fundraising network dispersed among many current campaigns. But her supporters have discussed whether she could helm a slimmed-down campaign operation and whether she would be able to maintain the less cautious, more freewheeling persona she has adopted since her loss in 2016.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHer view is: I ran against this guy, I know how to do this,\u201d said one of those close to her. \u201cShe has battle scars to prove it.\u201d\n\nThe chatter has made it out to the campaign trail. Asked about Clinton by reporters at a Des Moines high school on Monday, Warren parried: \u201cDo you have a question about education?\u201d Asked later what role Clinton should play in 2020, she replied, \u201cI do not have any comment on that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nViews about Clinton vary widely, however, and in part mirror the ideological and generational schisms that have fed the current anxiety. More seasoned leaders who have seen Democrats lose big have tended to prefer a safer, middle-road candidate more palatable to a wide range of voters. Those newer to the process are attracted to the vibrant and passionate candidates who can entice the base.\n\nAD\n\nThe push for liberal purity is one that raises warning flags for the Rev. Joseph A. Darby Jr., an influential black pastor in South Carolina. He said he fears a repeat of the \u201cMcGovern situation,\u201d referring to the 1972 presidential election that pitted liberal Sen. George McGovern against incumbent Republican Richard Nixon.\n\nHe \u201cwas the great white hope,\u201d Darby said. \u201cHe was the one that everyone went with because he was so wonderfully progressive, and he got his butt beat at the polls. I don\u2019t want to see a repeat of that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut he\u2019s also bothered by Biden\u2019s poor fundraising.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a lack of hustle or what, but it\u2019s a concern,\u201d Darby said. \u201cRunning for office ain\u2019t cheap these days.\u201d\n\nSome of the more moderate and lower-polling candidates, such as former Maryland congressman John Delaney, fault the Democratic National Committee for creating a system in which candidates who are already well known or have base-pleasing views have a massive advantage.\n\nAD\n\nThe party set a high threshold for grass-roots donors that candidates had to meet to make it on the debate stages, an incentive system that he said rewards far-left views.\n\nModerate candidates lose out if the DNC process trumps the traditional vetting role that voters in Iowa and New Hampshire have long played, he said.\n\nAD\n\nBiden, he said, hasn\u2019t offered enough new ideas for younger Democrats to embrace him. And Sanders and Warren, he said, are too far to the left to win.\n\n\u201cYou need to run on things that half the country agrees with you,\u201d he said.\n\nA key problem with many candidates, particularly the liberal ones, according to nearly all of the party leaders interviewed, is their support for ending the private health insurance industry via a Medicare-for-all plan.\n\nKamarck, the DNC member, said it\u2019s a \u201ctrap\u201d in which Warren, in particular, now finds herself stuck.\n\nAD\n\nWarren has been criticized for weeks for refusing to say how she\u2019d fund the massive program, eventually saying Sunday that she would release a detailed funding plan in the next few weeks. But the next day she remained uncomfortable discussing \u00adMedicare-for-all \u2014 insisting five times that reporters should focus on her education plan.\n\nAD\n\nWarren, whose stock has risen more than any other candidate this year, growing steadily as Biden, Sanders and Harris have faltered, also faces a renewed challenge from the left. Her main competition on that front, Sanders, has revived his campaign since suffering a heart attack three weeks ago, posting impressive fundraising numbers and hosting the biggest rally of the election cycle, featuring an endorsement from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\nAs she works to build a national campaign, Warren also has faced criticism from Iowa Democrats concerned about her absences.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what her strategy is. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s not here, but people have noticed,\u201d said Steve Drahozal, the chairman of the Dubuque County Democratic Party, who said he has appealed to the Warren campaign several times for the candidate to visit.\n\nButtigieg is matching Warren\u2019s formidable ground game in Iowa, according to county Democratic chairs. Klobuchar also has increasingly pinned her campaign on a strong showing there.\n\nA USA Today/Suffolk poll this week showed Biden and Warren tied in Iowa, with Buttigieg a few points behind, feeding worry among party leaders that the race could remain unsettled for a long while, as Trump whales on the Democratic field. Coale and others raised the prospect of an undecided convention, which he likened to \u201ca Geraldo show where chairs are flying.\u201d\n\nOther seasoned party hands noted that it\u2019s normal for Democrats to fret.\n\n\u201cDemocrats characterologically worry about everything,\u201d said Steven Grossman, a former Democratic Party chairman who is supporting Buttigieg. \u201cWe have that quality and characteristic, but I\u2019m not one of those people. I believe that whoever emerges from the primary process will be battle tested.\u201d", "description": "As they look at a weakened Republican president, Democrats see vulnerabilities in their own field.", "authors": ["Annie Linskey", "National Political Reporter Focused On The Presidential Campaign", "Matt Viser", "National Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/D5ll8h5r-N43cRj3onR8okzxlDA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NCE4NFXVA4I6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
