REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\n\nOn Tuesday, euro zone money market futures revealed a scaling back of bets on another near-term rate cut from the ECB, with the curve significantly steeper than it was before the Sept 12 ECB meeting.\n\nThe ECB last week cut interest rates by 0.10%, resumed a bond-buying program and introduced tiered rates for banks. That means banks are partly exempted from paying annual ECB charges on their excess reserves, helping mitigate the effect of low rates on lenders\u2019 profits.\n\nAnalysts and investors are still scratching their heads over the full impact of the ECB\u2019s moves, but two implications appear to be clear.\n\nFirst, under the tiered rate system banks are allowed to hold excess cash of up to six times their mandatory reserves without having to pay the penalty charge. They will now be charged 0% for parking excess reserves up to that limit at the central bank, rather than the deposit rate of -0.50%.\n\nMarkets have interpreted the move as a de facto rate increase.\n\nThis in turn has steepened the money market curve as investors bet the ECB will be reluctant to cut rates again soon.\n\nEonia money market futures dated to the ECB\u2019s December meeting show just a 25 percent chance of a 10 basis point rate cut ECBWATCH \u2014 having fully priced such a move just ahead of Thursday\u2019s ECB meeting.\n\nAnother ECB cut is not fully priced in now until April 2020.\n\n(Graphic: Euro zone money market curve, here)\n\n\u201cThe best way of summarizing it is that we essentially saw a bit of a rate hike last week, combined with forward guidance and QE to overall make it a dovish package,\u201d said Kacper Brzezniak, portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors.\n\n\u201cIf you take a weighted average of that (the tiered rates system) that takes rates to minus 30 bps, which is why you\u2019ve seen the front-end of the yield curve react quite negatively.\u201d\n\nAnother side effect of the tiered rate policy has been a selloff in short-dated bonds.\n\nIn euro zone benchmark bond issuer Germany, two-year bonds yields DE2YT=RR have risen around 10 basis points since the ECB meeting to trade near three-month highs of -0.64%.\n\n(Graphic: Germany's 2-year bond yield, here)\n\nAnalysts said the tiering decision would reduce demand for short-dated bonds from banks, given the much more favorable terms under tiering compared to buying short-term assets with negative rates.\n\nTiering makes it more attractive for banks to park part of their excess liquidity at the ECB and reduces the need to hold short-dated government bonds, which have deeply negative yields.\n\n\u201cThey have effectively reduced excess liquidity; that is not a desirable outcome,\u201d said Peter Chatwell, head of rates strategy at Mizuho.\n\n\u201cThe reason that the Eonia curve has gone higher is that the tiering of deposit facility was relatively generous compared to the 10 bps cut delivered,\u201d he added.\n\nAnalysts say that the tiered deposit rate and recent market reaction suggests that policy rates have approached an effective lower bound.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the asset purchase program is open-ended can point toward an ECB more willing to adjust timing of asset purchases rather than cutting deposit rates,\u201d said Natixis fixed income strategist Jean-Christophe Machado.\n\nInstead of cutting rates, the ECB could buy more and longer-dated paper to boost stimulus, he suggested.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s two-tier system will be implemented from Oct. 30, just after the bank\u2019s next policy decision on Oct. 24.\n\nThe bank has said that it will set the multiplier in a way that euro short-term money market rates are not \u201cunduly influenced\u201d. It can change both the multiplier or the rate it applies on exempt reserves over time.\n\n\u201cIf Eonia rates are rising, it would be an unintended effect, (so) you (would) have to adapt some parameters,\u201d said KBC rate strategist Mathias van der Jeugt.", "description": "The European Central Bank's decision to introduce a tiered interest rate may be inadvertently tightening rather than easing market conditions, dampening some of the impact from its move to cut interest rates and resume bond purchases.", "authors": ["Yoruk", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430896010&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1AW", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
