Leaders say that needs to change.\n\nBERLIN \u2014 German lawmakers and industry leaders warn their country is too dependent on foreign-owned digital infrastructure \u2014 and they have a plan to break free.\n\nThe strategy, which includes a project to develop a European cloud-hosting service named Gaia-X, aims to address growing alarm over the reliance of large firms, government services and even police forces on hosts such as Amazon to store their data.\n\nBerlin is gathering support for its idea across Europe, with France signing on last week to the idea of a European cloud infrastructure that would allow companies to store sensitive data with homegrown providers. The effort comes amid a broader push by European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen to bolster the bloc\u2019s \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d \u2014 defending EU interests thanks to a stronger home-grown industry, more innovative technology and more powerful defense capabilities.\n\nThe ability to store sensitive information with trusted hosts, or cloud providers, is seen as particularly key to German interests.\n\nControl over data is as crucial as oil and gas for industry.\n\nBerlin aspires to become a world leader in industrial or business-to-business data technology, a goal that senior industrialists argue will be difficult to achieve if foreign powers control the storage of sensitive data and can use their supremacy to pressure Germany.\n\nIn that sense at least, control over data is as crucial as oil and gas for industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like with access to gas \u2014 if we make our entire energy supply rely on a few nations in the world who get to control access, we\u2019re becoming politically dependent,\u201d said Benjamin Strasser, a member of the German parliament for the liberal opposition Free Democrats (FDP). \u201cIt\u2019s no different when it comes to data and data services.\u201d\n\nHis warning is echoed by business leaders and engineers who caution that growing tensions between the U.S. and China have destabilized international business ties.\n\n\u201cIn cloud computing, we rely on providers in the U.S. and China, who maintain a dominant position in providing cloud infrastructure,\u201d said Karl-Heinz Streibich, a former CEO of Software AG and the president of the German Academy of Science and Engineering (Acatech).\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we see tensions that affect trade, export and global supply chains \u2014 and this raises doubts, to say the least, if those countries will always act rationally in the future, including when it comes to dealing with other international partners,\u201d Streibich added.\n\nIn a country that prides itself on a history of innovation, the comments reflect a growing awareness that much of the country\u2019s administrative and industrial infrastructure runs on foreign technology.\n\nEarlier this year, German car giant Volkswagen said it would use Amazon Web Services \u2014 the cloud service of the Seattle-based tech juggernaut, which dominates around a third of the global market \u2014 to connect its 122 plants around the world. The firm is also cooperating with Microsoft, the world\u2019s No. 2 in the cloud market, to build up an \u201cautomotive cloud\u201d to connect cars.\n\nAt the same time, American technology is used to support much of Germany\u2019s public infrastructure \u2014 despite warnings by regulators that such moves pose a security risk.\n\nDue to a lack of domestic alternatives, Germany\u2019s federal police, for example, is storing its body camera footage on Amazon servers, with Germany\u2019s highest data protection watchdog warning this could allow U.S. authorities to demand access to it.\n\nSay hello to 'Gaia-X'\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel says she is concerned about the issue, and ready to respond.\n\nHer longtime confidante, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, has come up with a plan for a massive European cloud computing project to be named Gaia-X after the ancestral goddess and launched at the end of October in Dortmund.\n\nGaia-X is supposed to be a platform where European companies of all sizes can store, process and exchange data and cooperate on developing products, according to economy ministry officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans have not been officially announced.\n\nThe aim is to enable Europe and Germany's digital infrastructures to run independently if they were ever to be cut off from foreign cloud providers.\n\nTechnically, the idea is to establish what\u2019s known as \u201chyperscaling\u201d infrastructure, which can be adjusted according to demand. This, the ministry hopes, will guarantee European users that their data is \u201csovereign,\u201d which the ministry defines as safe from foreign snooping and from being cut off for political reasons.\n\nWhen Altmaier met his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire in the French capital last week, Le Maire said Paris supports the idea of a European cloud infrastructure, stressing that companies such as French industry giant Dassault could profit from such systems.\n\nAlthough Le Maire did not mention \u201cGaia-X\u201d by name, officials said that on a working level, the ministries in Berlin and Paris have already been discussing the idea.\n\nU.S. tech giants have taken notice of such talk, and they\u2019re pushing back.\n\nIn a blog post in German earlier this year, Microsoft Area Vice President Sabine Bendiek went all the way back to the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 to argue that by \u201cisolating themselves,\u201d Europe could end up falling further behind in technology.\n\nBut German lawmakers and corporate leaders are not deterred.\n\nThey say the effort does not aim to cut them off from global supply chains or end decades-old divisions of labor, but to enable Europe and Germany's digital infrastructures to run independently if they were ever to be cut off from foreign cloud providers.\n\n\u201cWe observe on the political world stage that economic and technological dependencies are used as a form of leverage,\u201d warned Acatech\u2019s Streibich, who also chairs the German government\u2019s platform for artificial intelligence and sits on the boards of German industry giants including Deutsche Telekom.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t rule out that our dependency from foreign cloud providers will be used as a means of exerting pressure on us.\u201d\n\nBut can Europe do it alone?\n\nCloud computing allows companies to rent access from a provider and pay for the storage space they use, rather than maintain their own servers.\n\nIn recent years, it has become a key factor for companies and governments involved the global race for AI supremacy.\n\nPreviously, applying artificial intelligence had largely been a privilege of those who owned huge servers and had cutting-edge developers on staff \u2014 predominantly American and Chinese tech giants. But recently, those companies have begun to roll out some of their AI solutions to the masses, offering them as part of their cloud computing packages.\n\nThe applications, accessed via cloud computing, allow even mid-sized businesses in rural Germany, the backbone of the country\u2019s economy, to boost their operations with AI, for example to analyze industrial data generated by its machines to optimize their performance.\n\nThe elephant in the room is whether the Continent is able to build developed cloud infrastructure on its own.\n\nBut the reality is that none of the providers offering those solutions are based in Europe.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to cloud computing, we\u2019re a digital developing country,\u201d said FDP opposition lawmaker Strasser.\n\nAnd whenever officials do call for similar cloud infrastructure in Europe, the elephant in the room is whether the Continent is actually able to build it itself.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re honest, we have to say that, technologically, other world regions are miles ahead of us in cloud computing,\u201d Strasser said. \u201cTo build up a comparable system here will require lots of work \u2014 but we should at least start with that quickly.\u201d\n\nStreibich dismissed a similar question, saying that \u201cit\u2019s irrelevant whether we are currently already technically able to build up such an infrastructure \u2014 there's no question that we must enable ourselves to do it, and that we can enable ourselves to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne question we should ask at the moment is which kind of infrastructure we want,\" he added.\n\nThe plan Berlin is pitching to the rest of Europe is becoming a world leader in building up digital infrastructure that focuses on industrial rather than consumer data.\n\nThis, the Continent\u2019s economic powerhouse hopes, will allow it to be a world leader in a second wave of industrial artificial intelligence that is about to set off.", "description": "Europe\u2019s largest economy relies on foreign cloud providers to store sensitive data.
