They're great, sure, but a Brit with a show from across the pond is who you really should be watching.\n\n\"The Graham Norton Show\" has settled back into Norton's oversize couch, and BBC America (Fridays, 11 EDT/PDT) for a new season of celebrities. And yes, just like the American late-night gabfests, he has guests telling funny stories and plugging new projects.\n\nSo what, exactly, makes Graham's show better than the typical American late-night versions? Perhaps it's the unique way he puts it all together with a little bit of booze (yes, the guests get to drink), a loud, gregarious set and, most importantly, an eclectic mix of celebrities who are forced to sit together -- and work off of each other -- for the entire show.\n\nGraham Norton with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on \"The Graham Norton Show.\" (Photo: Ian West, PA Wire/PA Images)\n\n\u201cHe always sets you up with just the most random characters that you would never find in one place,\" Kelly Clarkson told USA TODAY last month. \"I think that\u2019s really clever, and it breaks down walls when (guests) are nervous.\u201d\n\nClarkson would know. She's appeared twice on Norton's show, including last year with actors Hugh Grant and Jason Momoa as they laughed at stories from the audience. Past episodes include actress Whoopi Goldberg bopping along to K-pop artists BTS, and actor Keanu Reeves reminiscing about an album with singer Kylie Minogue. This season, Bruce Springsteen, Robert De Niro and Paul Rudd are scheduled to share the couch.\n\nThe Irish comedian and actor began his show in 2007 and kicks off its 26th season this fall. This year's scheduled guests include Renee Zellweger, Arnold Schwarzenegger RuPaul Charles and Helen Mirren.\n\nSo what should you expect when watching this Brit import? It's an hour, like most of its American counterparts. There's an opening monologue, but much shorter. There's no yammering on behind a desk for 10 minutes because Graham doesn't sit at one. And there are no segments with silly drinking games or high-production comedic sketches that will show up on YouTube later.\n\nInstead, Graham gets right to the guests and acts as the ringleader of a controlled circus, knowing that real entertainment comes from the celebrities on his couch. It's almost a throwback to Johnny Carson putting multiple people on the same stage and finding the extra magic that comes from sitting back and letting them work off each other.\n\nHis laughter is genuine when a guest finishes their rehearsed story. You can't tell whether he's expecting the punch line because he acts like he isn't.\n\nThere's banter, but it isn't forced. Instead, Graham knows when to insert some witty banter or a sarcastic aside and when to hold back and let the guests talk.\n\nLast season, Graham watched as Tom Hanks put \"Spider-Man\" star Tom Holland through an acting drill similar to those Hanks does for the \"Toy Story\" movies. He deftly navigated a subdued Madonna not remembering the only time she met Sir Ian McKellen. Graham seemed genuinely excited when actor Daniel Radcliffe presented him with a toy version of Norton, complete with a microphone and note cards. And on Friday's episode, Graham sits back and watches as RuPaul comes up with a drag name for Mirren.\n\nIn past years, he's watched Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig and Chris O'Dowd hold a funeral for a fly that died after drowning itself in O'Dowd's drink (\"I chewed it,\" O'Dowd confessed.). And in 2011, Robin Williams and Elijah Wood traded stories about their encounters with Jack Nicholson.\n\nAnd yet, with all the star power in front of him, Graham shoulders the burden of keeping the raucous cocktail party on his couch lively, and he does so masterfully. All of that while not making it about himself, which can sometimes be a trip-up for his American counterparts. You'll never see Graham driving to work with Jennifer Lopez or starring in a \"Saved By the Bell\" remake. It's about the people and the conversation and it all seems natural -- even if it is a show filmed in front of people and televised internationally. It's what a good chat fest should be for both the guests and the viewers.\n\nOr as Matt Damon once admitted on Graham's show, \"This is the best time I've ever had on a talk show.\"\n\nContributing: Bill Keveney\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/11/graham-norton-best-late-night-talk-show-youre-not-watching/3788192002/", "description": "\"The Graham Norton Show\" deftly combines celebrities and a rambunctious host to create a late-night talk show better than any American version.", "authors": ["Jenny Cohen", "Published A.M.
