Despite insisting a wedding isn't 'top of their priorities' at the moment, she mused: 'But you never know, you never know. It might just happen on a spur of the moment'\n\n'It's kind of not on the top of our list of priorities. We've very happy together and kind of in the mindset of: \"If it ain't broke, don't try and fix it\" kind of thing.\n\n'But you never know, you never know. It might just happen on a spur of the moment. We both don't want to have all of that drama of organising it and what not, so we don't know what we're doing.\n\nWould they elope? Lisa insists that running away to get married in secret isn't an option, because she wants key people involved.\n\nShe said: 'No, I don't think so because I would like my dad and my immediate family there, so I don't know. Maybe 2020 is the year we discuss it.'\n\nWould they elope?

He's very patient, very loving, very kind and encouraging, and I'm so lucky that he's like that.\n\n'When I was going through a bit of a funk last year he was very understanding and he's one of the most positive people I know, which is quite infectious and really good to be around.\n\n'He's just got a really good positive energy and he's super kind.'\n\nBy her side: George has been by Lisa's side as her body goes through menopause, the time in most women's lives when menstrual periods stop permanently\n\nMedication: Speaking openly about her experience, the presenter revealed that she has begun bioidentical hormone replacement therapy to relieve the symptoms of menopause\n\nGeorge has been by Lisa's side as her body goes through menopause, the time in most women's lives when menstrual periods stop permanently, and they are no longer able to bear children.\n\nSpeaking openly about her experience, the presenter revealed that she has begun bioidentical hormone replacement therapy to relieve the symptoms of menopause.\n\nBefore recognising what was happening to her, Lisa admitted that the weight gain she experienced did affect her, but that bioidentical HRT has helped to stabilise her weight.\n\nShe said: 'It [the weight gain] did affect me a little bit when I started going through the pre-menopausal symptoms. I didn't really know what was happening, and that was the confusing part for me.\n\n'My weight did fluctuate significantly and because I'm tall I can slightly get away with it, but equally my clothes weren't fitting me.\n\nFluctuating weight: Before recognising what was happening to her, Lisa admitted that the weight gain she experienced did affect her (pictured this month looking happy and fabulous)\n\nConfusion: Lisa explained: 'My favourite jeans were a bit too snug, my bras were getting a bit small and I was like \"what's happening?\"'\n\n'So, my hormones were all out of whack and it did affect me, but mostly because my clothes weren't fitting.\n\n'And I was just like \"dammit\" because I've never owned scales and I don't believe, for me, they work. And I think it's something you can become a bit obsessed about. I think it's more about how your clothes fit.\n\n'So, that was one of the tell-tale signs: My favourite jeans were a bit too snug, my bras were getting a bit small and I was like \"what's happening?\"\n\n'And then my periods went all over the place and I there were mood swings here and there and I sort of recognised that.\n\n'Since I've known about that I've been to the doctors recently and I'm on some bioidentical hormones, which is helping me.'\n\nAccording to the NHS, bioidentical hormones are hormone preparations made from plant sources that are promoted as being similar or identical to human hormones.\n\nHurrah! 'Since I've known about that I've been to the doctors recently and I'm on some bioidentical hormones, which is helping me' revealed Lisa\n\nWhile explaining why she opted for bioidentical HRB, as opposed to standard HRT medicines, Lisa admitted: 'I feel so much more balanced and in control.'\n\nShe said: 'You can get HRT but I went to a private doctor, so I've done it a little bit differently, but I think it's just good to get blood tests and find out what's actually going on.\n\n'It's a bioidentical hormone, so it's like an HRT but HRT is like pill or patch for all, which gives you all of the estragon, progestogen and testosterone, whereas I didn't necessarily need all three of those hormones, so it's kind of tailor-made for you.\n\n'That's what I would recommend, but not everybody can do that and it doesn't work for everybody, it's just the route I went down and it's working for me.\n\n'So that's [menopause and bioidentical HRT] where the weight gain and stabilising of my weight has come in, and I feel so much more balanced and in control because I know what to expect and I know what's happening.'\n\nStress-free: As well as medication, the former I'm A Celeb star has also made lifestyle changes to ensure her experience of menopause is as stress-free as possible\n\nPriorities: 'Knowing what's happening, I try and minimise doing anything I don't really want to do' she explained\n\nAs well as medication, the former I'm A Celeb star has also made lifestyle changes to ensure her experience of menopause is as stress-free as possible.\n\nLisa said: 'Knowing what's happening, I try and minimise doing anything I don't really want to do. Once you know what's going on you can understand it so you can work with it.\n\n'In my mind it wasn't talked about enough and that's why I've been quite open about that and I've been sharing my experiences on my social media etc.\n\n'I always want to be honest and I want people to know that they can come to me and I'll share what I'm experiencing and what I've found to counteract things.\n\n'And that's why I wanted to be involved in Seven Seas Perfect7, because I think it's an amazing brand it's a household name.\n\n'The Perfect7 and the vitamins, minerals and things go hand in hand with how I see health and nutrition, sleep and everything to balance you and to make you feel better.'\n\nNearly fifty! As she nears turning 50, Lisa admitted she's 'excited' about the next chapter of her life, and is in a stage of 'self-acceptance'\n\nBring it on! 'Obviously there have been a few blips throughout my forties, but now I'm kind of sailing through to my late-forties into my fifties I'm just like: \"bring it on!\"\n\nAs she nears turning 50, Lisa admitted she's 'excited' about the next chapter of her life, and is in a stage of 'self-acceptance,' insisting that a few grey hairs don't bother her and that she finds wrinkles 'charming.'\n\nShe said: 'It's exciting [nearing 50] because I've got more energy and I'm feeling good and I'm looking after myself and stuff, and I'm in a really happy place.\n\n'Like the Seven Seas Perfect7 research says, there are things that just fall into place: You feel good from the inside out, you don't sweat the small stuff, you have this sense of self-confidence and self-acceptance and it's really liberating.\n\n'When I got to 40 I thought 'Oh god I'm 40' but then I got to 40 and I was fine.\n\n'Obviously there have been a few blips throughout my forties, but now I'm kind of sailing through to my late-forties into my fifties I'm just like: \"bring it on!\". What else is there for me to do?\n\nNot bothered! 'Little things like a few grey hairs and few little laughter lines and crows feet, I'm like, really? [not bothered]' laughed the star\n\nPositive mindset! 'In the scheme of things I've got my health, I've got a great support system, I've got a lovely family, and I feel good, I feel really positive about turning 50' said Lisa\n\n'Little things like a few grey hairs and few little laughter lines and crows feet, I'm like, really?

It was like \"lines are not acceptable,\" but I think it's character, and I think it's charming, and I've always been a very expressive person.\n\n'I'm a TV presenter, and some TV presenters don't mind having a face that doesn't move but I'm quite expressive and I think you'd be able to tell.\n\nCharming: 'I think there was a phase where everybody was shooting their faces up so much. It was like 'lines are not acceptable,' but I think it's character, and I think it's charming' said Lisa\n\nGlossy locks: 'The only thing I do regularly is my roots. That's the one thing that I'm not ready to have wiry grey, so I just do that' explained the presenter\n\n'The only thing I do regularly is my roots. That's the one thing that I'm not ready to have wiry grey, so I just do that.\n\n'I think if you're looking after your skin: Cleansing regularly, going for facials, looking after the tone of it, I think that: \"I'm gonna be 50 in a few years, of course I'm gonna have lines on my face. I should have lines on my face!\" do you know what I mean?\n\n'For me it's more about texture and quality of skin. If it looks like and moisturised and I nice even tone, and a little bit weathered here and there \u2013 I think that's actually really beautiful.\n\n'When you can see somebody's true age shine through that's really positive, and I like that that's a bit more of a movement now, than this sort of slightly fake face.'\n\nLisa Snowdon has partnered with Seven Seas Perfect7 to support the confidence curve campaign.\n\nFor both men and women, Perfect7 combines Omega-3 capsules with multivitamin and mineral tablets to support seven key needs including energy, skin, hair and nails.
