The vast majority are just some group or local government who wants to try to get unwanted guns off the streets. It rarely has an impact on actual crime, but it\u2019s one of those well-meaning things that we tend to roll our eyes at, make fun of, but then generally ignore.\n\nYet in Cleveland, where they\u2019re soon hosting a buyback event, a local station decided to look at just what happens after you sell your gun at one of these events.\n\nMadar said ArcelorMittal Cleveland has been involved in the buy back program for about 12 years and that the company contributes about $10,000 to $15,000 for incentives. However, he said, the company also has a unique ability to destroy the guns after they\u2019re collected. \u201cWe make steel, and we have the opportunity that when we do charge the guns into the operation, that we can completely and thoroughly destroy them at that point,\u201d Madar said. \u201cBut the benefit is we can also make products here at the end of the process that are used for things like automobiles, appliances, construction, service center applications, things that people use on a daily basis to improve their lives.\u201d Police said the guns collected at buy back events go through ballistics testing before they\u2019re brought to ArcelorMittal every few years to be destroyed. They\u2019re melted down as part of the 11,000 or so tons of steel produced there daily, according to Madar. Madar said the company also works with other cities and organizations to do similar work. \u201cReally, the value there is just really taking those guns off the street, and hopefully we see less stories here, and certainly the Cleveland Division of Police have enough on their plate,\u201d Madar said. \u201cIf we can help that cause here and take something off of their plate, all the more reason to do that.\u201d Police said the buy back isn\u2019t about violating any Second Amendment rights. Rather, Ciaccia said, it\u2019s about taking guns from people who don\u2019t want them in order to ensure they don\u2019t end up in the wrong hands.\n\nNo, traditional buybacks aren\u2019t a violation of the Second Amendment. People are free to sell their guns to these buyback programs if they so wish. They\u2019re getting boned on the value, of course, but if they\u2019re OK with that, I\u2019m not one to judge them too harshly.\n\nOne would assume the ballistics testing is to see if any of the guns were used in homicides. However, since buybacks tend to be \u201cno questions asked\u201d affairs, it\u2019s unlikely to yield them any clues if it was. That\u2019s one of the real problems with these programs.\n\nThat said, we can see what happens to these guns.\n\nHowever, it should also be remembered that these things really don\u2019t do any good, even if police put a positive spin on them. Cleveland Police Public Affairs Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia told News 5 in Cleveland, \u201cWe\u2019re able to take in hundreds of guns over the course of years off of the streets.\u201d\n\nHundreds of guns? This thing has been going on for 12 years or so, right? \u201cHundreds\u201d of guns means just 20 per year. It might be more, but I somehow doubt that even if it were thousands of guns over that time frame, we\u2019d hardly see a difference. That\u2019s because the real problem people aren\u2019t using these things except to dump firearms so they don\u2019t get caught with them. That\u2019s it.\n\nThen guns get melted down.\n\nThe powers that be will pat themselves on the back, tell themselves their making a difference, all while failing to look at the real roots of the problems cities like Cleveland have.", "description": "We hear a lot about buybacks, even before Beto O'Rourke started throwing the word \"mandatory\" in front of the term, but what happens after?", "authors": ["Tom Knighton", "Author'S Bio", "Tom Knighton Is A Navy Veteran", "A Former Newspaperman", "A Novelist", "A Blogger", "Lifetime Shooter.
