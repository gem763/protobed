I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week.\u201d\n\nBolton had been scheduled to take part in a White House press briefing Tuesday on terrorism. Minutes after Trump\u2019s announcement, Bolton contradicted the president on Twitter, saying that he had offered to resign Monday night and Trump deferred the discussion.\n\nTrump and Bolton had disagreed on \u201cmany, many issues,\u201d White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said. Most recently, Bolton had advised the president against a meeting he had planned with the Taliban at Camp David to complete negotiations to end the war in Afghanistan.\n\nIn a two-sentence letter dated Sept. 10, Bolton wrote to the president: \u201cI hereby resign, effective immediately, as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. Thank you for having afforded me this opportunity to serve our country.\u201d\n\nBolton was also skeptical of Trump\u2019s overtures to Kim Jong Un. He was conspicuously absent in June when Trump made a snap decision to meet the North Korean leader at the Demilitarized Zone; Bolton instead traveled to Mongolia to meet with officials there.\n\nHis allies regarded Bolton as a handbrake on Trump\u2019s worst instincts; one person close to Bolton pointed out that in his tenure, the president had not made any \u201cbad deals\u201d in places including Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria or Afghanistan. Grisham overheard the person speaking to a small group of reporters at the White House and remarked sharply: \u201cRight outside my office.\u201d\n\nBolton\u2019s departure is a boon for Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, who had clashed with the national security adviser and now assumes an unchallenged role as Trump\u2019s closest adviser on foreign policy. Charlie Kupperman, the deputy national security adviser, will assume Bolton\u2019s position on an acting basis, deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley said.\n\nKupperman is a Bolton confidant who has counseled the former national security adviser for more than 30 years, Bolton has said. Grisham said it was \u201ctoo soon to say\u201d whether Bolton\u2019s closest National Security Council aides would remain in their jobs.\n\nPossible Bolton replacements discussed by Trump associates include Robert O\u2019Brien, who is the president\u2019s envoy for hostage affairs, and Brian Hook, Pompeo\u2019s senior policy adviser.\n\nForeign Setbacks\n\nGidley said in an interview on Fox News after Trump\u2019s announcement that it had become \u201cvery clear that John Bolton\u2019s policies and priorities did not align with President Trump\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAfter Bolton\u2019s departure, Kupperman and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told a gathering of the NSC\u2019s senior directors that Trump\u2019s policies hadn\u2019t changed and they should stay focused on their priorities, according to three people familiar with the matter. Kupperman will take a leave for a scheduled surgery in less than two weeks, they said.\n\nThe break came days after Trump abandoned his plan to meet with the Taliban at Camp David, capping a tough week. On Friday, the president\u2019s adviser on North Korea said negotiations have been stalled for months. On Thursday, Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt announced his intention to depart; the vaunted Israeli-Palestinian peace plan he\u2019s been working on has yet to be unveiled. The U.S.-China trade war drags on.\n\nCrude oil futures reversed an earlier gain in New York, falling 0.8% to settle at $57.40 a barrel.\n\nBolton, 70, joined the White House in April 2018, bringing an interventionist view into Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFrom the outset, Bolton seemed like an odd fit for a president who champions an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda and campaigned on disengaging the U.S. from wars prosecuted by his predecessors. At times, Bolton pursued his own longstanding foreign policy priorities, creating tension with top administration officials and the president himself.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he fired his hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, after disagreeing \u201cstrongly\u201d with many of his positions, ending a tumultuous tenure marked by multiple setbacks in U.S. foreign policy.Bolton, known for his hardline approach to U.S. adversaries, including", "authors": ["Jennifer Jacobs", "Nick Wadhams", "Jennifer Epstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SPYNEqrX6M41mmfORaBjyg--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/f99d7bee2d43208500171527ea3b473f", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
