But this weekend, \u201cJoker\u201d is issuing a challenge for the title of Top Clown.\n\nThe Village Roadshow/DC comic book movie is now estimated for a $93.5 million opening from 4,374 screens. That easily breaks the October opening record set by last year\u2019s \u201cVenom\u201d with $80.2 million, and also beats the $91 million opening of \u201cIt: Chapter Two.\u201d\n\nAmong comic book movies, \u201cJoker\u201d has also topped the $75 million opening of \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp\u201d and the $88 million opening of fellow R-rated drama \u201cLogan.\u201d \u201cJoker\u201d is now in a virtual tie with $93.8 million opening of \u201cJustice League,\u201d a film with all of DC\u2019s biggest superheroes.\n\nAlso Read: Huntington Beach Movie Theater Showing 'Joker' Closes Early Thursday Due to 'Credible' Threat\n\nOn the all-time R-rated box office charts, \u201cJoker\u201d has the fourth largest opening weekend ever. Sitting above it on the charts are \u201cDeadpool\u201d ($132.4 million), \u201cDeadpool 2\u201d ($125.5 million) and \u201cIt\u201d ($123.4 million).\n\nPrior to the film\u2019s release, \u201cJoker\u201d made headlines for becoming the first comic book movie to win the top prize at a major film festival, taking home the Golden Lion after its premiere in Venice. But pre-release word of mouth about the film\u2019s violence sparked fears that it would inspire real-life crimes similar to the 2012 cinema shooting in Aurora, Colorado. That theater announced that it would not screen \u201cJoker,\u201d while some other theater chains announced increased security this weekend.\n\nBut the shooting fears haven\u2019t stopped \u201cJoker\u201d from drawing a strong turnout, nor has its violence and bleak tone significantly weighed down word of mouth. Reception remains generally positive with a B+ on CinemaScore and a 4/5 on Postrak to go with a 70% Rotten Tomatoes score.\n\nAlso Read: 'Joker' Film Review: Joaquin Phoenix Channels Classic Robert De Niro in Grungy '70s Homage\n\nNext week will see little competition from \u201cAddams Family,\u201d a family animated film, or \u201cGemini Man,\u201d an action film starring Will Smith that is receiving weak reviews with a 43% Rotten Tomatoes score. The pieces are in place for \u201cJoker\u201d to leg out well through the end of the month, with overseas grosses just as strong with $140 million from 73 countries for a global launch of $234 million.\n\nWhile \u201cJoker\u201d is bringing in approximately 64% of all grosses this weekend, several September releases are holding well as counterprogramming for audiences who want something lighter. With men comprising approximately two-thirds of the opening night audience for \u201cJoker\u201d in CinemaScore polls, there\u2019s plenty of space for other films to perform with other demographics.\n\nUniversal/DreamWorks/Pearl\u2019s \u201cAbominable,\u201d for example, is holding well with family audiences with $12 million in its second weekend, a 42% drop from its $20.6 million opening. With the film\u2019s $70 million budget being co-financed by Universal and Pearl, it is on its way to turning a profit with a $37.8 million 10-day domestic total.\n\nAlso Read: Joaquin Phoenix Defends 'Joker' as Examination of 'Malevolent Person'\n\nFocus Features\u2019 \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d continues to bring in older female audiences, grossing $8 million in its third weekend for a total of $73.6 million. STX\u2019s \u201cHustlers,\u201d which has performed well so far with younger women, took in $6.3 million for a $91.4 million total after four weekends.\n\nCompleting the top five is \u201cIt: Chapter Two,\u201d which is slowing down overseas but hit a major milestone in North America on its fifth weekend, as it crossed $200 million in domestic totals with $5.2 million grossed and a $202 million total.\n\nJust outside the top 5 is Roadside Attractions\u2019 \u201cJudy,\u201d which expanded this weekend to 1,458 screens and grossed $4.3 million, bringing the film\u2019s total to $8.7 million after two weekends. The Judy Garland biopic has received strong reviews with an 83% Rotten Tomatoes score and building awards buzz for lead star Renee Zellweger.\n\nRead original story \u2018Joker\u2019 Beats October Record and \u2018It: Chapter Two\u2019 With $93.5 Million Opening At TheWrap", "description": "At the start of 2019, it was expected that \u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d would be Warner Bros.\u2019 top grossing film of the year.
