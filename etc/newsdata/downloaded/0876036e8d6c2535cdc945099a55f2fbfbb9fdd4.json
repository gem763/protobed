It includes lots of welcome new features, bound to improve your daily iPhone experience.\n\nBut one thing isn\u2019t quite ready: The exterminator to kill the bugs that come with it.\n\nDo you often download iOS updates on day one? Tell us about your iOS 13 upgrade experience so far. Join the conversation below.\n\nThe new software, which I have been testing, supports the iPhone 6s and later iPhones, including the little iPhone SE. While the iPhone\u2019s interface didn\u2019t change drastically, there are some significant developments, such as Dark Mode, intended to make the whole operating system easier on your eyes, along with new photo and video editing options, Memoji stickers and new parental controls. It also supports Sign in with Apple, a new privacy minded way to log in to websites and apps. This is the first year where Apple has broken out the iPad\u2019s software: The more dramatically updated iPadOS will be released next Tuesday.\n\nFrom night shooting mode to ultrawide lenses, Apple's latest iPhones have a bunch of new camera tricks.

In addition to the $699 iPhone 11, a follow-up to last year\u2019s iPhone XR, there are the $999-and-up 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, which I reviewed this week.\n\nThroughout the past week, using iOS 13 on the new phones and an older XR, I\u2019ve encountered minor but frequent bugs. The Messages app will sometimes flicker and the cursor can often get stuck; the Camera app periodically opens to a black screen and gets sluggish; apps\u2014including those developed by Apple\u2014have crashed unexpectedly.\n\nApple\u2019s new sign-in feature in iOS 13 allows you to access supported apps using your Apple ID. The system promises added privacy benefits over Facebook and Google\u2019s sign-in options. WSJ\u2019s Joanna Stern explains how it all works using some quirky bouncers.

This will include some additional features, such as the previously announced AirPod audio sharing, ETA-sharing in Maps, and improvements to AirDrop, and will also include bug fixes. It\u2019s always good not to rush into an OS update. In this case, unless you don\u2019t mind some bumps in the road, I suggest waiting until next week to do the download.\n\nIf you have automatic software updates turned on, you can turn it off by going to Settings > General > Software update and turning off Automatic Updates.\n\n(Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.)\n\n\u2014For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter.", "description": "Apple\u2019s newest update for iPhones has neat features like Dark Mode and Sign in with Apple, but it\u2019s also a bit buggy.
