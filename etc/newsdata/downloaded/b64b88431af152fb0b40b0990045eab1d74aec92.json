Johnson's letter was addressed to European Council President Donald Tusk and requests a three-month delay to Brexit.\n\nJohnson has previously said he would rather be \"dead in a ditch\" than delay Brexit beyond October 31, but was forced to request the extension after Parliament blocked a vote on his deal with the EU on Saturday. Tusk has acknowledged receipt of the letter, and said he would consult other EU leaders on \"how to react.\"\n\nGove said: \"That letter was sent because Parliament required it to be sent but... Parliament can insist the letter was sent but Parliament can't change the prime minister's mind, Parliament can't change the government's policy or determination and the prime minister is very clear \u2014 and so are European Union leaders \u2014 they want this done.\"\n\nGove said his strong preference was to leave with a deal, but added that the risk of the UK crashing out without a deal, likely an economic disaster for the country, had risen.", "description": "Gove said sticking to the Halloween deadline was the government's \"determined policy.\"", "authors": ["Shona Ghosh"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/58d28356112f7060008b5f70?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
