Giuliani is an obvious choice for the witness list.\n\nBut Democrats are split as to whether he would do more harm than good to their nascent impeachment inquiry and some expressed concern that hauling in a loose cannon like Giuliani in front of a committee would risk a replay of the circus-like atmosphere created by Trump loyalist and former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski\u2014a scene few Democrats are eager to recreate.\n\nStill, aside from the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, and the anonymous whistleblower who first raised Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Giuliani would perhaps be the next most important witness in the Ukraine-focused probe that House Democrats are promising to conduct.\n\nFor months, the president\u2019s personal attorney has pushed the new president of Ukraine to open a probe into the business dealings of Biden\u2019s son Hunter in the country, as well as Biden\u2019s own role in them, right as the two-term veep launched his own campaign to challenge Trump in 2020.\n\nAnd in the wake of new details about a complaint from an anonymous whistleblower regarding Trump\u2019s contact with Ukraine, Giuliani has embarked on a scorched-earth media tour, getting into shouting matches with cable TV news hosts as he insists they did nothing wrong\u2014in the process making startling admissions that have fueled scrutiny on the matter.\n\nThere\u2019s \u201cno question\u201d that House Democrats have to bring Giuliani in for testimony, said Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA), a member of the House Intelligence Committee. \"I think it would be revealing to the public.\u201d\n\nLate on Wednesday, Democrats on the Intelligence Committee learned more about the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, viewing a version of it in a closed setting, and came out saying that several figures, including Giuliani, had questions to answer.\n\n\u201cI think at some point,\u201d said Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT), an Intelligence Committee member, \u201cwe're going to want to talk to Rudy Giuliani.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is on board with this plan. . Democrats are already well aware of the challenge presented by a loose cannon Trumpworld figure, and they still feel burned by Lewandowski. The former Trump campaign manager\u2019s combative five-hour session before the House Judiciary Committee on Sept. 17 amounted to a massive middle finger to Democrats, who afterward privately panned the hearing as a disaster.\n\nGiven Giuliani\u2019s track record of theatrics and his fierce loyalty to the president, some Democrats worry that his testimony wouldn\u2019t contribute to legitimate fact-finding but rather turn Democrats\u2019 sober-minded mission into a complete circus\u2014as well as slow down an impeachment proceeding that nearly all Democrats believe needs to be completed with the utmost speed.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), a member of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, predicted a Giuliani testimony would be a Lewandowski-like spectacle and simply amplify the partisan takes he brings to cable news nightly.\n\n\u201cI don't know if we need to complicate this too much with a madman like Rudy Giuliani in Congress,\u201d said Swalwell. \u201cWhy waste your time?\u201d\n\nSwalwell also argued that Giuliani\u2019s testimony is largely not needed to further prove wrongdoing: \u201cThe president admitted to this,\u201d he said, referencing the memorandum that was released Wednesday morning describing Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, in which Biden was discussed and the president asked his counterpart for a \u201cfavor.\u201d\n\nGiuliani himself has indicated that Democrats face a tough slog if they want him before the Hill\u2019s klieg lights. Asked on Monday by The Daily Beast if he\u2019d agree to an interview with Congress, Giuliani replied: \u201cNo, not [with] the corrupt ones like Schiff and Nadler,\u201d in reference to the chairmen of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, respectively.\n\nA spokesperson for Schiff, whose Intelligence Committee is leading the investigation into the whistleblower\u2019s allegations, declined to comment. It is unlikely that Judiciary would request Giuliani\u2019s appearance and a spokesperson did not say if they would. A spokesperson for the House Foreign Affairs Committee\u2014which has been probing Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine activity and has requested documents from him\u2014did not say either if they would call him to testify.\n\nGiuliani also cited attorney-client privilege between him and President Trump as a reason for him not to testify, indicating that Democrats would likely face a court fight to compel his appearance. Such a move would greatly slow down the quick-strike impeachment proceedings that Democrats have outlined\u2014just as similar stonewalling slowed down their investigations into the obstruction of justice outlined in Robert Mueller\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cI think the President depends on these drawn-out battles where he can use his friends in the media and his friends in Congress to spin the message and try to confuse people and distract from the real issue,\u201d said Rep. Justin Amash (I-MI), whose support for impeaching Trump prompted his departure from the GOP.\n\nStill, the belief that Giuliani is a key figure in all this\u2014\u201cright in the center\u201d of the story, said one member\u2014might win out among Democrats.\n\n\u201cI mean, it seems that he's had more than one conversation with persons from Ukraine, about digging up dirt on the President's political opponent,\u201d said Rep. Val Demings (D-FL), an Intelligence Committee member. \u201cSo there is no doubt, based on what the White House released itself, that the president's personal attorney is playing a major role in this mess that we currently have.\u201d", "description": "Giuliani isn\u2019t really known for his staid public appearances these days, and that\u2019s exactly what gives some Democrats pause.", "authors": ["Sam Brodey", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569461064/190930-brodey-giuliani-tease_aqx5su", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
