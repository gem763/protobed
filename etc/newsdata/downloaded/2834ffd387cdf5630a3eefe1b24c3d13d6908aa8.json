REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol\n\nThe two companies are the leading industrial partners in a project to build a futuristic swarm of manned and unmanned warplanes, announced by the leaders of France and Germany two years ago and expanded earlier this year to include Spain.\n\nDassault and Airbus won a 65-million-euro contract in January to develop the concept for the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) but await a new contract to build demonstrators for interlinked fighters, drones and an \u201cair combat cloud\u201d by 2026.\n\nDassault Aviation Chief Executive Eric Trappier told a conference of policymakers last month that the demonstrator contract should have been launched in September but this was now slipping toward end-year. He called it \u201cindispensable\u201d to avoid any further delays in order to maintain the 2026 deadline.\n\nNo reason has been given for the delays.\n\nOn Monday evening, Dassault and Airbus amplified those warnings with a joint statement.\n\n\u201cIf Europe does not move forward \u2014 and move forward quickly \u2014 on this program, it will be impossible to maintain the development and production capabilities needed for a sovereign defense industry,\u201d the companies said.\n\nThe warplane system is expected to be operational from 2040, with a view to replacing Dassault\u2019s Rafale and the four-nation Eurofighter, in which Airbus represents both Germany and Spain.\n\nThe new project faces competition from Britain and its plans for a new combat jet dubbed \u201cTempest\u201d.\n\nThe fighter developments have split the current Eurofighter consortium and led to a shake-up of industrial alliances as Italy joins Eurofighter partner Britain on Tempest, turning its back on Germany and Spain, while Sweden has opened the door to abandoning its independent stance by co-operating on Tempest.\n\nThe FCAS is also overshadowed by differences between France and Germany over export policy after Germany imposed a ban on arms exports to Saudi Arabia over the death of killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi a year ago by Saudi operatives.\n\nThe ban, recently extended to March, has raised questions over a long-delayed Saudi border systems contract run by Airbus.\n\nAirbus Defense and Space Chief Executive Dirk Hoke called in a magazine interview last week for the export ban to be relaxed. German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government has said there is no reason for the moratorium to be lifted.\n\nFrance and Germany are expected to discuss the issue at ministerial meetings this week.\n\nAIRBUS SETBACK IN SPAIN\n\nAirbus meanwhile faces a battle to shore up its position as a top defense contractor in Spain after losing its place as the representative of Spain\u2019s interests on the upcoming fighter project to local defense electronics firm Indra Sistemas.\n\nSpain last month named Indra as contractor for the Spanish share of the Franco-German-led FCAS project, displacing Airbus from the Spanish coordinator role it had held on Eurofighter.\n\nAirbus officials have pledged to try to overturn the move but a Spanish defense source told Reuters there was no change in the decision.\n\nIndra declined to comment.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Eric Trappier, Chairman and CEO of Dassault Aviation is pictured at the factory of French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation in Merignac near Bordeaux, France, February 6, 2019. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\nPublicly, Airbus has said it was surprised by the decision but has pledged to continue to defend Spain\u2019s best interests.\n\nDassault will meanwhile mark a long-awaited milestone on Tuesday when it delivers the first of 36 Rafales to India, the culmination of a fighter procurement process that lasted almost 20 years and involved the cancellation of a much larger deal.\n\nLa Tribune reported on Monday that France and India were discussing a possible repeat order for 36 more Rafales.", "description": "France's Dassault Aviation and Europe's Airbus have stepped up pressure on France and Germany to agree the next stage of a planned fighter project, warning Europe's arms industry and long-term security could suffer from delays.", "authors": ["Tim Hepher", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438168179&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF961IL", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
