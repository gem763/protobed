For now, Ciot is Romania's reserve choice, she said.\n\nNica was put forward for the role in the summer alongside Plumb, but President-elect Ursula von der Leyen picked Plumb. However, the European Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee rejected Plumb, who was slated to get the transport portfolio.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of the Parliament committee in Brussels on Monday, MEPs voted by 13 to 7 to reject Plumb as \u201cunable to exercise\u201d her functions as commissioner. Plumb was called before the committee last week to account for two loans worth nearly \u20ac1 million that she did not declare in her original financial declaration scrutinized by MEPs.\n\nNica is a second-term MEP from the governing Social Democrats (PSD) and a former deputy prime minister and communications and internal affairs minister.\n\nHe was accused by Romanian corruption prosecutors of abuse of office when he was a communications minister, between 2003 and 2004, for deciding to lease Microsoft licenses from one provider, without opening a public procurement procedure, as required by law. However, the case was dropped because he was indicted after the statute of limitations expired.\n\nCiot's name was suggested during a meeting of the Social Democrats' executive committee on Tuesday afternoon. She's been a secretary of state for European affairs at Romania's foreign ministry for the past two years, according to her official biography.", "description": "Dan Nica proposed as Rovana Plumb\u2019s replacement, with Melania-Gabriela Ciot in reserve.", "authors": ["Carmen Paun"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20190930_EP-089948C_WT5_024-2-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
