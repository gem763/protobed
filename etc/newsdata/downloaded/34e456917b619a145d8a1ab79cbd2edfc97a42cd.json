It's a huge opportunity.\n\n'It's a team full of world-class players and to be given the chance to work with some of the players who I worked with a few years ago is really exciting. I can't wait to get started and see where we can get to.\n\n'England are the current 50-over World Champions and they made it to the final of the last ICC Women's T20 World Cup.\n\n'They're a very competitive side and they wouldn't be in big matches like that if they didn't have a really strong group of players who can perform on the big stage. I'm really looking forward to getting underway and helping the team progress.'\n\nMark Robinson (right) left his post after England suffered defeat in the Ashes this summer\n\nThe first challenge for the 48-year-old, an ex-ECB academy coach and currently in charge of the Perth Scorchers, will be the Twenty20 World Cup in her homeland in February.\n\nAli Maiden, interim head coach since Robinson's departure in August, remains in charge for the pre-Christmas tour of Malaysia.\n\nKeightley was Australia's third highest ODI run scorer when she retired as a player in 2005.\n\nShe was recently named London Spirit's head coach for next year's Hundred competition although it is now likely they will have to find a replacement.", "description": "As exclusively revealed by Sportsmail on Tuesday, Lisa Keightley succeeds Mark Robinson, the World Cup-winning coach who left the role following a heavy Ashes defeat last summer.", "authors": ["Richard Gibson", "Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/18/20340762-0-image-a-12_1572373064502.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
