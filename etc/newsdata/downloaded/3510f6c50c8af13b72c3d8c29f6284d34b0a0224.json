Life imprisonment.\u201d\n\nProsecutor Duncan Atkinson QC said the body of Debbie Griggs was disposed of and her car was found dumped streets away from her home in Deal, Kent.\n\nHe told the trial: \u201cThe prosecution case is that Debbie Griggs did not just up and leave her husband and children in the middle of the night, never to be seen or heard of again.\n\n\u201cShe was a devoted mother who would not have just abandoned her children.\u201d\n\nThe court heard that the disappearance followed suspicions her husband was having a relationship with a 15-year-old girl.\n\nGriggs had denied murder and claimed to be asleep when his wife left home for the last time.\n\nHe denied ever being in a relationship with the 15-year-old, telling the police in the days after his wife\u2019s disappearance the girl was \u201cjust a mate\u201d.\n\nMs Griggs complained at the time her husband had threatened to \u201cget me sorted\u201d, the trial heard.\n\nIn an affidavit she wrote in 1999, Ms Griggs said: \u201cEverything we have together is in fact his, and I am only allowed to enjoy anything that is a joint matrimonial asset by reason of being with him.\n\n\u201cHe does not let me go out by myself. His needs come first.\n\n\u201cHe tells me I am sick and mad in the head.\u201d\n\nAlso in an affidavit from the time, Ms Griggs said: \u201cDuring the course of our marriage my husband was bombastic and bullying.\n\n\u201cHe has threatened to get me sorted. I took that to mean he will do me harm or will arrange for some other to do me harm.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

This is how long it has taken for this to come to justice.\n\n\u201c20 years of anguish, torment and heartache. 20 years of hurt, pain, despair and emotional turmoil.\n\n\u201c20 years without a daughter, sister and grandchildren and nephews. 20 years of lost communication and three young boys without their mother.\n\n\u201cFinally, 20 years have come to a conclusion, we can put this to bed.\n\n\u201cWe will never forget Debbie, who was an amazing daughter, a remarkable sister, an extraordinary and committed, compassionate person, not only to her friends but to everyone.\n\n\u201cShe was a passionate doting mother with unequivocal love for her children who meant the absolute world to her.\n\n\u201cShe will be forever in our thoughts. This is an immense day for us, a long time in coming.\n\n\u201cFor Debbie we are oh so sorry that this has taken so long, and for mum if you are listening, we actually finally got him.\n\n\u201cWe would appeal to the defendant if he can see within his wisdom to perhaps telling us where Debbie\u2019s body is so we can put the ultimate closure to this.\u201d\n\nPress Association", "description": "A sailor whose pregnant wife vanished 20 years ago has been convicted of her murder. \u201cDevoted\u201d mother-of-three Debbie Griggs disappeared without a trace on 5 May, 1999 and has never been seen since.
