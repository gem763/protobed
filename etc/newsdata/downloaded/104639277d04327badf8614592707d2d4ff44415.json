Chad Green took the mound for the Yankees, tossing one inning before handing the ball off to a long line of relievers, while Brad Peacock\u2018s rare playoff start was capped at 1 2/3 innings. According to ESPN Stats & Info, that made it the first postseason game since 1999 in which neither starting pitcher lasted two innings or longer.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAll told, the two clubs utilized a total of 13 pitchers to make it through nine innings. The Astros lost Ryan Pressly to a worrisome knee injury in the third, but were able to lean on Jos\u00e9 Urquidy for 2 2/3 innings of one-run, five-strikeout ball. Although Yankees\u2019 bullpen fought back in every inning, they had considerable difficulty recovering from Yuli Gurriel\u2018s three-run homer off of Green in the bottom of the first:\n\nStill, New York managed to get in a couple of knocks as well: first, with Gary Sanchez\u2018s RBI single in the second inning, then with Gio Urshela\u2018s 395-foot blast in the fourth inning \u2014 the second of his postseason career to date. That wasn\u2019t enough to close the gap, however, and Alex Bregman\u2018s productive groundout in the sixth helped cushion the Astros\u2019 lead as they headed toward the final few innings of the series.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat lead started to look a little shaky in the ninth. Only three outs away from a ticket to the World Series, Houston closer Roberto Osuna gave up a leadoff single to Urshela, which was quickly followed by a jaw-dropping, full-count, game-tying two-run shot from DJ LeMahieu that barely cleared the right field fence.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the threat of extra innings and a potential loss looming, the Astros engineered a last-minute rally to regain the lead and stake their claim for the pennant. With two outs and no runners on, George Springer took a five-pitch walk from Aroldis Chapman. In the next at-bat, Houston pinned their hopes on Jos\u00e9 Altuve \u2014 and he didn\u2019t disappoint, lifting a 2-1 slider out to left field for a 406-foot, two-RBI homer that confirmed the Astros\u2019 series win.\n\nThe 2019 World Series will mark the third Fall Classic appearance for the Astros and the first for the Nationals. It all begins on Tuesday night.", "description": "Jos\u00e9 Altuve led the Astros to victory with an ALCS-clinching walk-off home run win against the Yankees.", "authors": ["Ashley Varela"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Mapj3XizKzIajWtvVFmXLg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DdmH2b5zSIst6wq9n7eDwQ--~B/aD0xMDgxO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/1a9e2acd148e14d67413bcdb9369196f", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
