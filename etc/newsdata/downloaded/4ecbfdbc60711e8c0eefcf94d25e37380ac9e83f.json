And much more important:\n\nWhat did the College Football Playoff selection committee see?\n\nNo getting around this: It's a bad, bad loss. The Sooners are suddenly in a very precarious position \u2013 their Playoff hopes are now on life support \u2013 with no margin for error and suddenly glaring flaws.\n\nBut going unbeaten is hard to do, and getting beaten on the road in conference play is not necessarily a killer. Getting drilled, though? That would have been devastating.\n\nWhich is why a frenzied fourth-quarter comeback might turn out to have been very, very important.\n\nTOO GOOD:Big-time players have Ohio State looking like the No. 1 team\n\nTOUGH WIN:No. 3 LSU holds off Auburn to set up Alabama showdown\n\nTrailing by 25 early in the fourth quarter, the Sooners almost came all the way back \u2013 18 points, and then an onside kick that was thisclose to theirs \u2013 and, well: Was it enough to dampen at least some of the impact of a shocking loss?\n\nThe answer won\u2019t come now. Or even Nov. 5, when the selection committee releases its first set of rankings. But if Oklahoma recovers and wins out, how does the committee view the result on Dec. 8, when the four-team bracket is revealed?\n\nWhen Kansas State led 48-23 with 12:54 left, it appeared we were headed toward a result as inexplicable \u2013 and perhaps as resounding \u2013 as the most inexplicable upset of 2018: Purdue 49, Ohio State 20.\n\nThat, you might recall, was the Buckeyes\u2019 only blemish last season, but it was debilitating. When the final selections were made, it was a huge reason they were left out of the field, ranked No. 6 behind one-loss Oklahoma and one-loss Georgia.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why the last few minutes in Manhattan, Kansas, might have mattered. A lot.\n\nThere\u2019s no sugarcoating the result. And given the lack of a marquee non-conference victory, it will be difficult for Oklahoma to climb back into contention.\n\nBut the final score, and how it happened, looks a lot more like Oklahoma\u2019s 48-45 loss to Texas a year ago \u2013 when the Sooners trailed by 21 before coming all the way back to tie \u2013 than what Purdue did later that month to Ohio State.\n\nWhen James Gilbert\u2019s 2-yard touchdown run completed a 10-play, 73-yard drive, putting Kansas State up 48-23 with 12:54 left, he seemed to have sealed a dominant victory. Instead, Oklahoma came to life.\n\nThe rally began when CeeDee Lamb took a short pass and raced 70 yards for a touchdown, and it wasn\u2019t over until that ball glanced off a Sooner\u2019s leg before their onside kick had traveled 10 yards.\n\nOklahoma recovered the loose ball. But it was overturned on replay, and it was the right call. Otherwise, the Sooners would\u2019ve had the ball inside Kansas State\u2019s 40 with 1:43 left \u2013 and given how the last few minutes had gone, no one would have been surprised to see them tie it up.\n\nInstead, Kansas State knelt, burning the final seconds away, to notch the Wildcats\u2019 first real signature victory under new coach Chris Klieman. This seems like a good time to note that Klieman\u2019s North Dakota State teams won four of the last five FCS national championships. He likes to say, \u201cfootball is football.\u201d\n\nThe Wildcats have been inconsistent this season \u2013 they\u2019d beaten Mississippi State on the road, but managed a total of 25 points in consecutive losses to Oklahoma and Baylor. Against the Sooners, they ran the ball very well and got timely, accurate passing from Skylar Thompson \u2013 and some critical running from the quarterback, too.\n\nIt was a terrific performance. But it was also an inexplicable disappearance by Oklahoma\u2019s defense, which until Saturday had been much improved under new coordinator Alex Grinch.\n\nThe Sooners, who were down two defensive starters in the secondary, gave up third-down conversion after third-down conversion \u2013 many of them third-and-long \u2013 and resembled their 2018 selves more than anything we\u2019d seen this season.\n\nOklahoma now moves to the very back of the line of playoff contenders, but it's still in the chase.\n\nMuch more important, at least for now: After the Schooner crashed in Manhattan, there\u2019s no remaining margin for error. And suddenly, the Sooners seem susceptible to making plenty of errors.\n\nBut if they can recover? History shows that if Oklahoma wins out, it\u2019ll have at least a shot of getting into the four-team bracket \u2013 which is why a rally that fell just short might turn out to have been a very important development.", "description": "Oklahoma's shocking loss to Kansas State looked to end its College Football Playoff hopes, but a comeback to make things close may loom large.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/26/USAT/055b7c72-3de5-47c4-8028-d40ed8848044-USATSI_13572382.jpg?crop=2823,2117,x943,y247&width=2783&height=2117&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
