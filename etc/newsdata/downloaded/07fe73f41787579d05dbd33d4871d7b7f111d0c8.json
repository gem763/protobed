He downgraded Clovis (ticker: CLVS) to Market Perform from Outperform, and cut his price target to $10 from $22. The stock closed at $4.59 on Monday.\n\nClovis didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment about the downgrade.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nThe back story. Shares of Clovis are down 74.5% this year. The company\u2019s drug Rubraca, a so-called PARP inhibitor that treats ovarian cancer, is facing growing competition from offerings from AstraZeneca (AZN) and a GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) subsidiary.\n\nWhat\u2019s new. In his note, Berens said the deal, under which Clovis made a $12 million upfront payment for the rights to a preclinical radiopharmaceutical program, was a bad sign.\n\n\u201cWhile the deal to in-license a radiotherapy for [about] $12 [million] up front does not seem exorbitant and could eventually add fundamental value, it burdens Clovis with development expenses and milestones at a time when equity investors are increasingly concerned that the company is not aligned with their best interests,\u201d Berens wrote. \u201cDevelopment of these programs will draw on incremental financial resources at a time when many investors remain concerned about near-term cash flows and solvency of the company.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the deal could distract from Rubraca, and said that it suggests that a \u201cnear-term acquisition of the company is unlikely.\u201d\n\nHis lowered price target remains 118% higher than the Monday closing price, but Berens said \u201ccurrent management strategies are unlikely to unlock this value in the near term.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead. Shares of Clovis were down 3.2% in premarket trading on Tuesday, after falling 3.3% on Monday. The stock was trading at $4.44, below its 52-week low of $4.56. S&P 500 futures were up 0.3%.\n\nWrite to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com", "description": "SVB Leerink analyst Andrew Berens said a deal in which Clovis made a $12 million upfront payment for the rights to a preclinical radiopharmaceutical program was a bad sign.
