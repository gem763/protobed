The payments were arranged by Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer\u2019s Michael Cohen prior to the presidential election.\n\nMr. Trump has always maintained the payments were not illegal and if they did cross a line it is because Cohen bungled the job.\n\nBoth women claim to have had affairs with Mr. Trump years before he ran for president. He has denied the allegations.\n\nMr. Vance is also investigating whether the Trump Organization falsified business records related to the payoffs.\n\nLast week, it was reported that Mr. Vance\u2019s prosecutors met with Cohen at the federal prison in Otisville, New York, where he is serving a three-year sentence for arranging the payments and other crimes.\n\nMr. Trump and The Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 payment made to Ms. Daniels. Separately, the publisher of The National Enquirer paid $150,000 to Ms. McDougal for keeping quiet about her allegations.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
