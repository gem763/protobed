The global growth outlook has been slashed to the lowest in a decade after the International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecasts for Australia and backed the Reserve Bank's move to cut interest rates to a record low. The growth forecast has been cut from 2.1 per cent to 1.7 per cent - a figure below the government and RBA's forecast.
