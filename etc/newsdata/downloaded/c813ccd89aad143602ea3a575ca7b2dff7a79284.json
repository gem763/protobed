Seven percent of voters were undecided.\n\nThe 50 percent who support Trump\u2019s removal is identical to the percentage who approve of the intensifying impeachment inquiry into the president, and who would support the House\u2019s voting to impeach Trump. Similarly, 44 percent of voters oppose the inquiry, and 43 percent would oppose the House\u2019s impeaching the president.\n\nThe new poll is the latest public survey to show plurality or majority support for House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, which began in earnest last month amid evidence that Trump used his power as president to press foreign governments to investigate his political rivals. But other polls show Americans are more divided on whether Trump should be removed from office.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
