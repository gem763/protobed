No charges have yet been laid, he added.\n\nA school newsletter reveals that Fiona only married 13 months ago, to Pavo Viotti, 32, who has a top venture capital and private equity company in Cape Town.\n\nThe pair have now separated, according to local reports.\n\nOutlining the claims against Fiona, one of the boy's parents told the IOL news site: 'He was a willing participant in the beginning but became a victim when he couldn't get out of it.\n\n'The teacher started texting him to come to her house on the campus and that's how it started but it got to the stage where he had had enough.\n\nViotti - the daughter of former South Africa rugby coach Nick Mallett - was a history teacher, but also coached the water polo team (pictured) and the under-14 rugby team. It is not clear if any of the alleged victims were taught or coached directly by her\n\nThe former model had been dating banker Pavo Viotti (right) since 2008 and the pair married just 13 months ago\n\nPavo is now said to have separated from his wife, and refused to answer the door at their \u00a3350,000 Cape Town property. She is thought to be living with her parents\n\n'But the teacher wouldn't let him go and he went to his parents for help and they went to the headmaster and now it is all coming out.'\n\nSeveral sources including one close to the pupil involved added: 'It seems this has been going on for about six years.\n\n'That is why the headmaster is asking for other boys past and present to come forward with information. If the rumours at the school are correct there could be many many more involved.'\n\nThe South African Police Service have not been involved as criminal charges have not been laid as the schoolboy is two years over the age of consent.\n\nA school source said: 'It would appear this is not a criminal matter but one of gross misconduct between a teacher who has stepped over a clear line and it is a matter for the school to handle.\n\n'They have appointed a senior lawyer who is independent of the school to ensure the matter is investigated properly'.\n\nSchool principal Guy Pearson admitted to the sex scandal rocking the elite school in a statement saying: 'We can confirm that there have been several boys who have been affected over a number of years.\n\n'The investigation into the serious sexual misconduct of one of our female teachers is ongoing and we have appealed to boys and parents for any information that will add to our understanding.\n\n'We understand there will be lots of questions but please appreciate this is a matter which needs to be managed with the utmost sensitivity and I cannot share more information at this stage'.\n\nThe school also revealed that it has made a team of psychologists and psychiatrists available to any boy or family member that may have been affected by the events surrounding the teacher.\n\nThe disgraced teacher's father Dave Mallett is also a history teacher at the same Christian church school and coaches the rugby 1st XV and her grandfather Anthony was a former headmaster there for 18 years.\n\nBishops Diocesan College is one of South Africa's most prestigious schools, with alumni including astronaut Mark Shuttleworth and South African cricket star Herschelle Gibbs\n\nDave Mallett, Viotti's father, is a history teacher, housemaster, and rugby coach at the school - and has spoken of his 'devastation' after the claims were revealed\n\nEnglish-born housemaster Dave, who has remained at the school despite the allegations against his daughter has sent a message to parents saying his family faced 'tough times ahead'.\n\nThe devastated dad said: 'Thanks very much for the messages of support that we have received in the wave of the devastating events involving my daughter Fi and our family as a whole.\n\n'Tough times ahead no doubt \u2013 but I'll be soldiering on to support my family as best I can.\n\n'Obviously Fiona's health and safety is our priority right now and we will be doing all we can to help her pull this through' he said.\n\nBishop's Diocesan College is a private school founded in 1849 by Bishop Robert Gray to teach Christian values and educate the sons of colonialists in Cape Town and costs \u00a315,000 a year to attend.\n\nFormer pupils include astronaut Mark Shuttleworth and South African cricket star Herschelle Gibbs.\n\nFiona is a former model, played water polo as a teenager, and was one of the 'Beauties of Sport' featured in Sports Illustrated in 2009 \u2013 a year after she met her future husband.\n\nThe couple fell in love in 2008 while backpacking in Vail, Colorado, and their adventures took them to South America, Europe and South East Asia before they returned together to Cape Town.\n\nThey were married in September last year in a white wedding in Plettenberg Bay and were planning a family together until the school scandal hit the news.\n\nShe is believed to be in hiding with her parents at their home in Cape Town, while he has refused to comment or answer the door at their \u00a3350,000 home in a Cape Town suburb.\n\nBoth have deleted all their social media accounts and close friends say they are living apart at the moment.\n\nSouth African media has widely publicised the link between the former Springbok coach Nick Mallet and his niece and no denials have been made that any photos or videos posted are not of Fiona.\n\nA former schoolboy at Bishops Diocesan College who was taught water polo by the school mistress said: 'Every boy at the school was besotted with Fiona as she looked like a supermodel.\n\n'But the thing was she was never flirty and comes across as a very shy and innocent and very nice girl and to hear these allegations has just blown me and a lot of the guys I went to school with away.\n\n'Fiona's uncle Nick was the Springboks coach and her dad Dave coaches the rugby 1st XV and her grandfather Tony was headmaster here for nearly 20 years after he emigrated here from England.\n\n'The Mallets are part of the fabric of the recent history of Bishops and I cannot believe Fiona of all people has been having sex with her pupils as she is the total opposite of the sort of person you would suspect.\n\n'The word is that there is a lot more to come out and former pupils who left the school years ago are being contacted. It is a great school and one of the best in South Africa and you just don't expect this.'", "description": "Fiona Viotti, 30 - who is the niece of former South African national rugby coach Nick Mallett - quit the \u00a316,000-per-year Bishops Diocesan College in Cape Town amid claims of an affair with a pupil.", "authors": ["Jamie Pyatt In Cape Town For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/11/19878714-0-image-a-16_1571393412650.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
