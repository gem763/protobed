The system crawled along Grand Bahama Island at just 1 mph (2 kph) and was expected to generate a storm surge of 18 to 23 feet (6 to 7 meters).\n\n\u201cWe need you to bunker down,\u201d Kwasi Thompson, minister of state for Grand Bahama, warned people. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be another 10-12 hours that we\u2019re going to be bombarded with this.\u201d\n\nThompson and other officials said they received distress calls about rising floodwaters, but rescuers could not go out in the violent conditions.\n\n\u201cThey are ready to get into those areas as soon as the weather subsides,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile in the United States, the National Hurricane Center extended watches and warnings across the Florida and Georgia coasts. Forecasters expected Dorian to stay just off shore, but meteorologist Daniel Brown cautioned that \u201conly a small deviation\u201d could draw the storm\u2019s dangerous core toward land.\n\nBy late Monday morning, the water had already reached roofs and the tops of palm trees in Grand Bahama. One woman filmed floodwaters lapping at the stairs of her home\u2019s second floor.\n\nIn Freeport, Dave Mackey recorded video showing water and floating debris surging around his house as the wind shrieked outside.\n\n\u201cOur house is 15 feet up, and right now where that water is about 8 feet. So we\u2019re pretty concerned right now because we\u2019re not at high tide,\u201d said Mackey, who shared the video with The Associated Press. \u201cOur garage door has already come off. \u2026 Once we come out of it with our lives, we\u2019re happy.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Dorian churned over Abaco Island with battering winds and surf and unleashed heavy flooding as people called radio stations and sent desperate messages on social media to find loved ones.\n\n\u201cWe received catastrophic damage here in Abaco,\u201d Parliament member Darren Henfield told reporters. He said officials did not have information yet on what happened in nearby cays. \u201cWe are in search-and-recovery mode. \u2026 Continue to pray for us.\u201d\n\nInformation began emerging from other affected islands, with Bahamas Power and Light spokesman Quincy Parker telling radio station ZNS that there was a total blackout in New Providence, the archipelago\u2019s most populous island. He also said the company\u2019s office in Abaco island was flattened by the storm.\n\n\u201cThe reports out of Abaco as everyone knows,\u201d Parker said as he paused for a deep sigh, \u201cwere not good.\u201d\n\nMost people went to shelters as the storm neared. Tourist hotels shut down, and residents boarded up their homes. But many people were expected to be left homeless.\n\nOn Sunday, Dorian\u2019s maximum sustained winds reached 185 mph (297 kph), with gusts up to 220 mph (354 kph), tying the record for the most powerful Atlantic hurricane to ever make landfall. That equaled the Labor Day hurricane of 1935, before storms were named. The only recorded storm that was more powerful was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with 190 mph (305 kph) winds, though it did not make landfall at that strength.\n\nForecasters said Dorian was likely to begin pulling away from the Bahamas early Tuesday and curving to the northeast parallel to the U.S. Southeast seaboard.\n\nAn advisory from the hurricane center warned that Florida\u2019s east-central coast could see a brief tornado sometime Monday afternoon or evening.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster issued an order Sunday for the mandatory evacuation of his state\u2019s entire coast. The order, which covers about 830,000 people, was to take effect at noon Monday, at which point state troopers were to make all lanes on major coastal highways one-way heading inland.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t make everybody happy, but we believe we can keep everyone alive,\u201d McMaster said.\n\nA few hours later, Georgia\u2019s governor, Brian Kemp, ordered mandatory evacuations for that state\u2019s Atlantic coast, also starting at midday Monday.\n\nAuthorities in Florida ordered mandatory evacuations in some vulnerable coastal areas. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper warned his state that it could see heavy rain, winds and floods later in the week.\n\nDorian first came ashore Sunday at Elbow Cay in Abaco Island, then made a second landfall near Marsh Harbour. A storm surge was reported at 18 to 23 feet (5.5-7 meters).\n\nThe Bahamas archipelago is no stranger to hurricanes. Homes are required to have metal reinforcements for roof beams to withstand winds into the upper limits of a Category 4 hurricane, and compliance is generally tight for those who can afford it. Risks are higher in poorer neighborhoods, with wooden homes in low-lying areas.\n\nAfter leaving the Bahamas, Dorian is forecast to drift north, spinning 40 to 50 miles (64 to 80 kilometers) off Florida, with hurricane-force wind speeds extending about 35 miles (56 kilometers) to the west.\n\nThe hurricane center issued a hurricane watch for Florida\u2019s East Coast from Deerfield Beach north to Altamaha Sound in Georgia. A storm surge watch was extended northward along the Georgia coast to the Savannah River. Lake Okeechobee was under a tropical storm watch.\n\nWeekend traffic was light in Florida despite the many evacuation orders, unlike during the chaotic run-up to Hurricane Irma in 2017, when the unusually broad storm menaced the entire state.\n\n___\n\nCoto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.
