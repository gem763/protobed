The ranking came in the bank's annual \"Doing Business\" report Wednesday which saw Korea overtaking not just the U.S. and Japan but Hong Kong.\n\n\u25c6 Infrastructure\n\nThe World Bank has been assessing the business-friendliness of countries since 2003 and Korea has steadily risen from 16th in 2010 to fourth place this year.\n\nThe World Bank bases its evaluation mostly on infrastructure which is conductive to business. Its 10-point list of criteria includes \"construction permits, getting electricity, registering property and enforcing contracts.\" Those areas are Korea's strong points.\n\nBut the evaluation did not include the Achilles heel of the Korean corporate landscape, which is labor relations.\n\nKorea is notorious for its militant unions. \"The most common complaints among domestic and foreign businesspeople are frequent strikes by unions and red tape, like regulations that ban hotels within a few hundred meters from a school, but the World Bank's evaluation did not reflect any of these factors, so it's difficult to take the ranking seriously,\" said Kim Dong-wook at the Korea Employers Federation.\n\n\u25c6 Poor Labor Relations, Red Tape\n\nUnlike the World Bank, Forbes, the International Institute for Management Development and the World Economic Forum ranks Korea about average.\n\nIn this year's global competitiveness evaluation by the WEF, Korea ranked 26th, while the IMD's corporate efficiency list placed Korea 37th. The WEF and IMD make the evaluations based on culture, political and economic conditions and labor relations rather than infrastructure.\n\nThe IMD evaluates a country's labor market based on 24 categories, including salaries, working hours, labor relations, labor population and the number of highly-educated foreign workers. Korea cannot score high in most of those categories.\n\nThe WEF also asks 100 executive from each country about the overall business environment. This year, it said many executives complained about the government's fickle policies, bureaucratic inefficiency, tough accessibility to financial services and strict labor regulations.\n\nForbes analyzes inflation, unemployment, taxation and corporate-friendly policies in around 120 countries, and economic indicators, and expert opinions are also included in the final ranking.\n\nThose categories do not exist in the World Bank's evaluation.\n\n\"Looking at the evaluations of many institutions, we can see that Korea gets low grades in terms of software,\" said Kim Sung-tae at the state-run Korea Development Institute.", "description": "Korea Bafflingly Ranked 4th Best Place to Do Business", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2015/10/28/2015102801796_0.jpg", "published_at": "2015-10-28"}
