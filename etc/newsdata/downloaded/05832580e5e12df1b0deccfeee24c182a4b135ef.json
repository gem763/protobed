Kelly from a Chicago jail wants her money back.\n\nValencia Love, who is listed on Kelly's bond documents as \"a friend\" of the singer, recently filed a motion in the Cook County Circuit Court to get the money back.\n\nKelly was released from local custody on bond in February, but was arrested again in July on federal sex-crimes charges and has been in jail ever since.\n\nRead more: R. Kelly held in jail without bond, after prosecutor argues he poses 'danger' to young girls if set free\n\nOn Tuesday, her attorney told the judge that Love had no knowledge that federal investigations in New York and Illinois were also underway against the singer, The Chicago Sun-Times reported.\n\nLove's attorney said Kelly is a man of \"vast resources\" and could pay the bond himself. But Judge Lawrence Flood was unmoved, and denied the motion.\n\nIn this June 6, 2019, file photo, singer R.

Flood said the money might eventually be eaten up by court costs, fines, or attorneys fees.\n\nKelly has notoriously struggled with money in recent years amid fallout from the numerous sexual assault allegations against him. His lawyer, Steve Greenberg, told reporters in February that the accusations have damaged his earning power.\n\nHe was dropped from his record label in January, has struggled to earn residuals from his work, had a number of musicians yank collaborations from streaming services, and has been in jail for months and unable to tour.\n\n\"This is someone who should be wealthy at this stage of his career,\" Greenberg said in February. \"And through mismanagement, through hangers-on, and bad contracts, and bad deals, and bad leases like he had in his studio. He really doesn't have any money at this point. I don't even think he owns the rights to 'I Believe I Can Fly.'\"", "description": "Valencia Love paid the R&B star's bond without realizing that federal investigations were ongoing against Kelly, her attorney said in court Tuesday.", "authors": ["Michelle Mark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d44889cb44ce7048b51b72c-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
