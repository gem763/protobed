According to the whistleblower complaint over Trump\u2019s now-infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump made the \u201cask,\u201d White House lawyers allegedly buried records of the call in a highly classified \u201csuper secret\u201d server reserved for information regarding covert operations and other sensitive intelligence actions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to reporting by the New York Times, not all National Security Council (NSC) officials have access the special computer software required to penetrate the secret server, and \u201cin extreme cases, agency aides must physically enter the offices of the intelligence directorate to read documents stored in the system.\u201d Records of presidential phone calls within foreign leaders rarely belong in there.\n\nBut why should we care about how these categories of information is stored in the first place?\n\nCongress established the NSA as an independent agency in 1947 under President Harry Truman. Its members currently consist of the president along with the secretaries of State, Defense, Army, Navy and Air Force, as well as others who serve at the president\u2019s discretion with Senate approval. The NSA\u2019s job is to provide advice and coordination for the president on national security matters relating to domestic, foreign and military policies. The NSA doesn\u2019t decide what to do about national security policy \u2014 it makes recommendations, and the president makes the calls. The statute creating the NSA also created the CIA.\n\nTo understand the gravity of the information gathered and disseminated amongst NSA members, one need only look at the minutes of the very first NSA meeting held in Washington in September 1947. Discussion topics included \u201cReview of the World Situation as it Relates to the Security of the United States.\u201d\n\nJust months earlier, in March 1947, Truman delivered a speech before a joint session of Congress announcing what became known as the \u201cTruman Doctrine,\u201d which reoriented American foreign policy toward intervening in conflicts in light of increased tension with the Soviet Union.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe NSA does important stuff, and it\u2019s important to American foreign policy, national security and the annals of U.S. history that careful, legitimate record-keeping be scrupulously maintained.\n\nSo, to repeat today\u2019s stunner: The whistleblower complaint states that federal government lawyers took steps to shield the existence of Trump\u2019s July 25 call from Congress and the public by sticking it in a super-secret server, where it was unlikely to see the light of scrutiny. It doesn\u2019t take a legal expert to conclude that the maneuver smells of a political coverup.\n\nKeep in mind, too, that in 2004, Congress passed another law creating the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI). That office was supposed to forward the whistleblower complaint to Congress \u2014 but that handoff was stymied when the Department of Justice intervened with a spurious legal analysis for bypassing an unambiguous legislative mandate.\n\nWas all of this legal?\n\nThe short answer to the question is, probably yes \u2014 with Trump\u2019s authorization. Under Executive Order 13526 (Dec. 29, 2009), the president and vice president both have the authority to classify and declassify material. That said, the order, signed by President Obama, explicitly states that material may not classified or suspended from declassification if done, in pertinent part, in order to:\n\n\u201cconceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error\u201d\n\n\u201cprevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency\u201d\n\n\u201cprevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of the national security\u201d\n\nClassifying records of the June 25 call arguably violated all of these prohibitions. As noted above, the phone call and surrounding circumstances could give rise to criminal violations, which the White House worked to conceal. The server-stuffing appears to be done to avoid embarrassing Trump and/or to hide the July 25 call without a national security rationale.\n\nExecutive orders occupy a bizarre corner of constitutional law. They can function as directives to execute the law \u2014 which is squarely within the scope of presidential power \u2014 or they can entail presidential legislating. Legislating is Congress\u2019s job under Article I. The Constitution does not expressly authorize executive orders, but presidents have issued them since the dawn of the republic. Executive orders are thus functionally treated as laws regardless of the Constitution\u2019s silence around them. Arguably, Trump and his staff were bound by this one unless and until Trump himself issued a new executive order that supersedes Obama\u2019s.\n\nBut once again, this is a quandry for which the Constitution provides no clear answers. The question isn\u2019t whether this second act in the all-things-Ukraine play was legal, but whether our system of government imposes consequences for breaches of the norms of legitimacy and public service that shore up agencies like the NSA in the first place. Without consequences for violating laws and norms, the laws and norms themselves \u2014 including, for that matter, the Constitution itself \u2014 become meaningless.\n\nKim Wehle is a former assistant U.S. attorney and a former associate independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation.
