I cannot in good faith be complicit in papering over his record.'\n\nThere she is! Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance at the 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum at Benedict College on Saturday, despite claiming she was boycotting the event. Harris said she decided to attend after one of the event's sponsors she found objectionable were 'removed'\n\nOn Friday, Harris said she would not attend the forum after one of its sponsors - The 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center - honored Trump with an award (pictured)\n\nTrump subsequently mocked Harris on Twitter, taking aim at her sinking poll numbers, which are now in the single digits.\n\n'Badly failing presidential candidate Kamala Harris will not go to a very wonderful largely African American event today because yesterday I recieved [sic] a major award, at the same event, for being able to produce & sign into law major Criminal Justice Reform legislation, which will greatly help the African American community (and all other communities), and which was unable to get done in past administrations despite a tremendous desire for it,' the President tweeted.\n\n'This and best unemployment numbers EVER is more than Kamala will EVER be able to do for African Americans!'\n\nHarris then snapped back, writing on Twitter: 'My whole life I've fought for justice and for the people - something you'd know nothing about. The only part of criminal justice you can claim credit for is the 'criminal' part.'\n\nHarris is pictured at the 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum in South Carolina on Saturday\n\nHowever, Harris - who was once California's Attorney General - has come under fire for her tough-on-crime stance in her home state, with many saying she unfairly targeted African Americans and other minorities during her time as a top prosecutor.\n\nAccording to The Los Angeles Times, the African American incarceration rate in California remains more than five times their share of the state's population.\n\nMeanwhile, she also supported a 2008 San Francisco policy that reported arrested undocumented juveniles to ICE.\n\nOutside of her alleged 'flip-flopping' on crime, Harris has also come under fire for making contradicting statements about her beliefs in Medicare-For-All.\n\n'This and best unemployment numbers EVER is more than Kamala will EVER be able to do for African Americans!' Trump tweeted\n\nThe senator responded to Trump on Twitter, tweeting: 'My whole life I've fought for justice and for the people - something you'd know nothing about. The only part of criminal justice you can claim credit for is the 'criminal' part.'\n\nOn Saturday, many fans of the politician refuted that she had flip-flopped on her attendance at the criminal justice forum.\n\n'She didn't change her mind. The organizers of the forum agreed with her and sent the sponsor who awarded Trump packing,' one wrote.\n\n'Kamala Harris was able to reshape a whole weekend of CJR programming based on her singular, unilateral protest and remove an objectionable sponsor. She didn't change her mind - she brought about change,' another chimed in.\n\nTaking to the stage at the event, Harris explained why she decided to boycott the event.\n\n'Let me just be clear so you can hear it from me,' she said. 'I refused to come because frankly Benedict College students were excluded and also I said I wouldn't come because I couldn't believe that Donald Trump would be given an award as it relates to criminal justice reform.'\n\n'This is someone who's disrespected the voices who have fought for justice and sacrificed to create leadership around justice in this system.'\n\n'Someone who dares, dares, use the word 'lynching' on the soil of South Carolina where blood has been spilled, he dares to compare himself to the people who have been on the wrong side of the system. That is inappropriate.'", "description": "Harris told reporters at the 2019\u00a0Second Step Presidential Justice Forum that she reversed course on attendance after learning that the sponsor was 'removed' from the forum.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/00/20228886-0-image-a-4_1572131353136.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
