'Something has gotten into Kevin, and it wants out.'\n\nAs the season seven premiere opened, Captain Lee Rosbach, 70, had docked his ship in Phuket, Thailand, where the new cast would be shortly be joining him onboard.\n\n'You really have some good talent there,' he told Ashton Pienaar, 30, who was working as a bosun for the first time and would be managing the deckhands.\n\nBiggest meal: The new chef got sick ahead of preparing a meal for a guest's wedding proposal\n\n'There's 500 percent more pressure on me this season than last season,' Ashton told the cameras privately. 'Last season, I just had to manage myself, and that on its own is a challenge.'\n\nKate was introduced to Kevin, and showed him to his quarters, wondering if he would be someone she could get along with this season.\n\n'If I had a dollar for every crazy yacht chef I've worked with, I would own a yacht with a crazy yacht chef,' she noted warily.\n\nCrazy chefs: Chief steward Kate Chastain said she's worked with lots of crazy chefs\n\n'But Kevin looks like Tom Cruise mixed with Hugh Grant. I'm really hoping maybe he's the one to break the crazy mold. But God just really has a wicked sense of humor.'\n\nKate's new second steward, Simone Mashile from South Africa, was a bubbly, enthusiastic worker who called herself 'a blond in a past life,' and wanted to do well and advance.\n\nBy contrast, her new third steward, Courtney Skippon from Vancouver, admitted that she 'didn't like working,' but needed to pay off student loans.\n\nNew addition: Simone Mashile from South Africa joined the crew as a steward\n\n'Service makes me a little uncomfortable sometimes,' affirmed Courtney, a child of privilege. 'I am not used to servitude.'\n\nCaptain Lee thought the greenest employee might be Abbi Murphy, 24, a deckhand who called herself 'one of the boys,' and ditched a full scholarship to law school to sail around.\n\n'I did it on a whim,' the Boston native said in a confessional. 'But I just get that gut feeling and I go with that choice, because my gut is my best friend.'\n\nBeing honest: Courtney Skippon admitted that she did not like working\n\nGreenest employee: Abbi Murphy, 24, a deckhand who called herself 'one of the boys' ditched a full scholarship to law school to sail around\n\nAs she showed her new crew around, Kate marveled: 'Everyone is hotter than the next. Our crew is so hot that Ashton is like the least hot.'\n\nShe was realistic, however, saying as the show began that 'In theory, it's possible to be one big, happy family, but it never lasts long.'\n\nNew deckhand Tanner Sterback, 26, called yachting 'a hundred percent the best job I've ever had, 'specially when I look down and I'm barefoot and in a T-shirt for a living.'\n\nThe bosun: Ashton Pienaar was promoted to bosun\n\nHis motto was 'GVO: Good Vibes Only.'\n\nCaptain Lee began the trip with a crew meeting and ran through the boat's rules.\n\n'I don't want to catch you embarrassing yourself or the boat,' he emphasized. 'If I have to go bail somebody out of jail, you will go straight to the airport.'\n\nSeason seven: Captain Lee Rosbach was in command of the Valor in Thailand\n\nThere was less than a day to go, so the crew put away the provisions being brought on board, all of them sweltering in Thailand's heat.\n\nBrian De Saint Pern, another new deckhand, called himself 'a wild child,' but revealed to Abbi that he had a five-year-old daughter name Micah back in South Africa.\n\n'Having my daughter was a big reality check for me because I was 24, I used to binge-drink a lot, I used to go three days straight with no sleeping\u2026 I definitely needed to change my ways.'\n\nNew deckhand: Brian De Saint Pern, another new deckhand, called himself 'a wild child,' but revealed to Abbi that he had a five-year-old daughter name Micah back in South Africa\n\n'I just want to be the best role model for my daughter,' he explained. 'If I mess up on the jobs, I'm going to let her down.'\n\nCaptain Lee, Kate and Kevin reviewed the new charter guests: Entrepreneur Michael Castellano, his girlfriend of six years, Samantha Ledwell, and their close friends.\n\nMichael wanted to have a private candelight dinner for himself and his girlfriend with a live violinist, which Kate worried would be too much for her new crew.\n\nSpecial meal: Michael Castellano told Kevin about his plans to propose to Samantha Ledwell\n\nAbbi, who liked drinking, was tasked with making cocktails for the guests, while Simone was charged with ironing\u2014a task that Abbi hated.\n\n'They're just nice and respectful,' Kate marveled of her new stewards.\n\nBut she was already knocking heads with Kevin, who looked for a labelmaker to label his spices\u2014which she called 'OCD'\u2014and made a family-style meal that spelled more work for her.\n\nCool crew: Kate marveled out how 'nice and respectful' the new stewards behaved\n\nKevin grew irritated when his guests started asking for lunch and he wanted to serve it, but Kate was nowhere to be found, and when she showed, there were no plates for guests.\n\n'Plates on the table, Jesus. That's 101,' he said.\n\n'There are no plates on the table because usually the chef plates the meals,' Kate observed.\n\nNo plates: Kevin got a little frustrated when the first meal had no plates on the table\n\n'With Kate, it's very important for us to be in sync,' Kevin acknowledged. 'But I'm not going to let it screw me up if it's not perfect this first charter.'\n\nAfter their first lunch, the crew rushed to get water trampolines and canoes set up for the guests, then scrambled to put everything away afterward.\n\n'I couldn't ask for a better crew right now,' Ashton said, urging them to go eat.\n\nWater sports: The guests took advantage of canoes available for them to explore Thailand\n\nKevin's Thai dinner, with Tom Yum soup, yellow curry and pork belly, was deemed 'incredible' by the guests, but he complained about the shortage of plates to Kate.\n\n'Get off my ass, Kevin,' she yelled at him.\n\n'Sorry, Kate, that's the last place I'd like to be,' he retorted.\n\nBack off: Kate yelled at Kevin to get off her back\n\n'I think that we're going to have some issues with Kevin and service,' she told the cameras. 'He's very particular. He's going to lose it real soon.'\n\nBut crazy cooks made good cooks, she noted, adding: 'Tonight he proved he can cook very well.'\n\nAs the night wound down, the guys compared notes on the new female employees.\n\n'I wanna hook up with Kate,' Tanner said. 'I think she's sexy as f***.'\n\nRomantic interest: The guys compared notes and Tanner had a liking for Kate\n\n'That's super-flattering,' Kate said, when Courtney told her. 'Also super-creepy.'\n\nThe next day, Kevin found himself ill with stomach cramps and diarrhea, but knew he had to push through as Michael had told him he would be proposing to Samantha over dinner.\n\n'Jesus, the stomach thing today,' he moaned. 'This couple are going to remember this night for the rest of their lives. I've got a bit to do tonight. I'm a bit worried whether I'm going to get this all done or not.'", "description": "Chef Kevin Dobson got so sick with stomach cramps and diarrhea that it threatened to derail a man's marriage proposal on Monday's season premiere of Below Deck.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/08/19431850-0-image-a-172_1570520673677.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
