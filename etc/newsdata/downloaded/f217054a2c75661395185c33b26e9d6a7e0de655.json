This means that if the image is accurate to the finished design (and not just a placeholder), then we could be getting our first good look at the newest MacBook Pro.\n\nWhile the image is definitely of a larger MacBook with thinner bezels, there\u2019s no way to tell from here whether the most requested change \u2014 a new scissor-switch keyboard that\u2019s rumored to be debuting on the 16-inch model to replace Apple\u2019s heavily maligned butterfly switches \u2014 is present as well.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time Apple\u2019s accidentally leaked a new product design with beta icons, either: the company confirmed the iPhone X\u2019s redesign with a beta icon, as well as the iPhone XS Max and iPad Pro redesigns last year. Most recently, Apple\u2019s rumored noise-canceling AirPod Pros might have made an appearance in the iOS 13.2 beta.\n\nApple\u2019s been rumored to be working on a 16-inch MacBook Pro that would debut a new design for some time, with Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claiming that the larger model will introduce a new keyboard that will trickle down to the rest of the lineup in 2020. Historically, Apple has had a second fall event in October where it has tended to focus on iPad and Mac updates. Combined with the beta images, it could mean that we\u2019re just a few days away from Apple formally announcing the new laptop.", "description": "Rumors have been circulating for months that Apple is readying a new, 16-inch MacBook Pro model \u2014 some reports claiming as early as this year \u2014 and we might have just gotten a first look at it, thanks to a new image hidden in the latest macOS Catalina 10.15.1 beta.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dq2SEyaW1LLHrEDDE0PwJ2QhEcQ=/110x207:1152x753/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19299162/macbookpro16inch.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
