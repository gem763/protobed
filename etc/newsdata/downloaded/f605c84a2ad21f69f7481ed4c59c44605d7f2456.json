As the president walked past the teen, she was caught on camera flashing him a seemingly icy stare that has since gone viral.\n\nSince Trump took office, his administration has rolled back numerous environmental protections, including major clean water regulations earlier this month. In 2017, Trump famously announced that he was pulling the U.S. out of the Paris agreement that leaders and delegates came to the summit to discuss.\n\nAt the summit, Thunberg, who is nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, blasted world leaders for showing more interest in making money than saving the planet by reducing carbon emissions\n\nGreta | Stephanie Keith/Getty More\n\nRELATED: Teen Climate Activist Greta Thunberg Blasts World Leaders at the UN: \u2018How Dare You!\u2019\n\n\u201cPeople are suffering,\u201d the teenager passionately said. \u201cPeople are dying.
