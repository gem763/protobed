It does not apply to rodeos.\n\n\"California is a leader when it comes to animal welfare and today that leadership includes banning the sale of fur,\" Mr Newsom said in a statement.\n\nThe ban does not apply to leather, cow hides and the full skin of deer, sheep and goats, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. It also does not apply to stuffed animals.\n\nThose found breaking the law could face a fine of $500 (\u00a3395) or in repeat cases, $1,000.\n\n\"We applaud Gov Newsom and the state's lawmakers for recognising that California citizens do not want their state's markets to contribute to the demand for fur products,\" a statement from Humane Society USA said.\n\nBut the decision was criticised by the Fur Information Council's spokesman Keith Kaplan. He claimed it was part of a \"radical vegan agenda using fur as the first step to other bans on what we wear and eat.\"\n\nLast May, fashion house Prada announced that it would stop using fur, starting with its spring-summer 2020 line.\n\nIn February, the UK's Selfridges announced it would be banning the sale of exotic animal skins from February 2020.", "description": "From 2023, residents cannot manufacture or sell items made from animal fur.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12B24/production/_109208567_006786349-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
