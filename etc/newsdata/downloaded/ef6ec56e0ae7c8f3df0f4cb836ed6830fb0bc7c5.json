But now it's George Grimwade-Musto,\" the Samford University football player said in a viral video produced by the school's football program. In the poignant video, the name Grimwade on the back of his jersey is stripped off, and a new name, Musto, is sewn on.\n\n\"I decided to change my last name because my stepdad \u2014 which sounds weird calling him my stepdad, because he's always been my dad to me \u2014 he doesn't have anyone to carry on his last name.
