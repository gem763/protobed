Graham: The experts strike back\n\nIn mid-August, Taylor was told that not only was the money delayed, but that Donald Trump didn\u2019t want to deliver it at all. Taylor prepared to resign in protest, though he still didn\u2019t understand the reasons for the hold. Then Tim Morrison, the top Russia expert at the National Security Council, told him that the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, had told a Zelensky adviser that the security assistance was dependent on Ukraine launching an investigation into Burisma, the natural-gas company on whose board Hunter Biden served.\n\n\u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meetings are conditioned on investigations?\u201d a horrified Taylor asked Sondland via text. Sondland told Taylor to call him. (Sondland had already shown signs of cloak-and-dagger methods, Taylor testified, including being adamant that a June call not be transcribed.) On the phone, Sondland told Taylor that Trump wanted Zelensky to publicly promise to investigate Burisma and a Ukrainian role in the 2016 U.S. election. \u201cEverything\u201d was dependent on this, Sondland told Taylor.\n\nTaylor talked with Sondland on September 8. Sondland said that Trump had insisted it was not a \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d but that if Zelensky did not \u201cclear things up,\u201d the two sides would reach a \u201cstalemate\u201d on security assistance. Sondland also told Taylor that Trump was a businessman, and that before he signed any deal, he wanted to make sure he got what he was paying for.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump\u2019s incriminating call with the Ukrainian president\n\nTaylor didn\u2019t buy that for a moment, pointing out that Ukraine didn\u2019t \u201cowe\u201d Trump anything, especially interference in an election. The next day Taylor texted Sondland, \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d Sondland replied, five hours later, \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d\n\nOf course it was a quid pro quo. Trump was smart enough to claim that what he was asking for was not a quid pro quo, but asking for something in exchange for something else is \u2026 the definition of a quid pro quo. When Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Thursday that the U.S. had been involved in a quid pro quo, it was, then, a classic Kinsley gaffe: a politician accidentally telling the truth.\n\nMulvaney tried to take back his admission, but Taylor\u2019s account shows he was right the first time\u2014as though the testimony of other diplomats and a plain reading of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky weren\u2019t already evidence enough. Taylor\u2019s testimony reportedly elicited \u201csighs and gasps\u201d in the closed-door hearing, and it\u2019s clear why. There ought to be no need for a smoking gun by now, because Trump has all but admitted to the crime, but just in case it was necessary, Taylor\u2019s testimony delivered a still-warm pistol with Trump\u2019s fingerprints all over it to congressional investigators.", "description": "It doesn\u2019t matter what President Trump wants to call it\u2014of course it was a quid pro quo.", "authors": ["David A.
