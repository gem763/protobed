Because of this, I\u2019ve been trying to use only my gentlest, dry-skin-friendly products. When I stopped by the Pai (a London-based, female-owned skin-care brand) booth at the expo, this Hydrating Cream Cleanser immediately caught my eye. The cleanser incorporates camellia, a potent source of vitamin E and omega-9\u2019s, as well as rose, known for helping the skin retain moisture. It\u2019s especially thick and creamy (a bit richer than Biologique Lait U, for example) and leaves my skin feeling velvety and plump. Though it\u2019s definitely on the pricey side, a little bit goes a long way and, if like me you\u2019re ultra-sensitive, you know how hard it is to find a cleanser that\u2019s gentle enough to not irritate the skin. My Dr. Loretta Cleanser is magical and non-stripping, but this cleanser actively conditions on any dry or tender patches. I was recently talking to a fellow eczema sufferer about Pai, and she told me that no matter what the state of her bank account is, she\u2019ll always carve out money to ensure she has this cleanser in her medicine cabinet. Plus, it comes with a washcloth that you can use to gently exfoliate your face after cleansing, which I\u2019ve been using lately in place of chemical exfoliants (I like to run it under some lukewarm water, then use it to remove my cleanser).", "description": "The 5 Best Products I Discovered at the Indie Beauty Expo including Camellia & Rose Gentle Hydrating Cleanswer, Flair Eyeshadow Palette, Quim Happy Clam Everyday CBD Oil, Aromatica Organic Aloe Vera Gel and Graydon Super Sensitive Skin Stuff.", "authors": ["Rio Viera-Newton"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/09/12/12-pai.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
