The clues led law enforcement to the mountains near the Yunnan province in southern China.\n\nAfter a search on foot proved fruitless, police used a drone to survey the area. Authorities flew the UAV five hours before \u201ca blue colour steel tile appeared on the steep cliff,\u201d according to the police statement. The drone operator zoomed in on the tile and saw that there was a small cliff under it, as well as \u201ctraces of activity and domestic garbage.\u201d\n\nPolice hiked for over an hour to get to the bottom of the cliff, before some members of the group carefully snuck up the cave to find an \u201cunkempt face\u201d on a \u201cold man with a dirty body,\u201d which they determined to be the 63-year-old fugitive.\n\nAccording to the state media, Song had difficulty communicating as he hadn\u2019t used language for a long time. But he reportedly did confess to escaping a labour camp. He told authorities after he escaped jail \u2014 where he was serving a sentence for trafficking women and children \u2014 he fled to his hometown then found the cave in the nearby mountains. Song reportedly said has lived in the approximately 6.5-square metre stone cave for 17 years.\n\nPhotos released by authorities show eating utensils, bedding, plastic bottles and not much else.\n\nThe statement said Song will go back to jail. \u201cWaiting for him will be a high-rise window,\u201d according to police.", "description": "Chinese police used a drone to track down a convicted human trafficker 17 years after he escaped from jail....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/wxc2srjovszlipdpwjjd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
