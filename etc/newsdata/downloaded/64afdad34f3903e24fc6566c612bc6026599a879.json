He had previously reported similar concerns to a superior on July 10.\n\nLt Col Vindman is currently the director of European affairs on the White House's National Security Council.\n\nHe was the first serving White House official to give evidence, and arrived for the private hearing in full military uniform.\n\nThe soldier and diplomat said: \"I was concerned by the [July 25] call.
