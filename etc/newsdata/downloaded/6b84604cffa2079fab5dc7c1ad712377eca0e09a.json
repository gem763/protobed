This is the story of its birth.", "language": "en", "text": "Jew and a small crew of interns and artists working on the game\u2019s many characters often spent their time playing other games as they waited for the development team to catch up to the work they were doing. One of the team leads caught on and told them they had to play League of Legends every day. So they did, begrudgingly at first. But then something happened about six months before the game was set to roll out to the public: The playtesters and interns started playing League not because they had to, but because they wanted to.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat was when we realized we had something that could work,\u201d Jew said. \u201cAnd it was pretty damn close to launching.\u201d\n\nThat launch on Oct 27, 2009 was just one memorable moment in Riot Game\u2019s 10-year journey down a road punctuated by terror, wild leaps of faith, and powered by an army of interns and a lot of luck.\n\nInception\n\nThe birth of League of Legends was more about a philosophy than a design document, as co-founder Marc Merrill describes it.\n\nMerrill and co-founder Brandon Beck were college buddies, both studying business at the University of Southern California, who bonded over their shared love of video games. After graduation, the two became roommates, sharing an apartment in West Hollywood while working in their respective jobs \u2014 Beck as a management consultant at Bain & Company and Merrill pursuing business management.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe would always just talk about games whenever we saw each other,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cWe would have back-to-back gaming nights at our apartment. That's the thing we loved to do every single moment we ever could possibly do it.\u201d\n\nThey both also loved the idea of working on a video game, but neither saw a viable pathway into game development with their backgrounds.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t engineers or designers, so we didn\u2019t see a career path on the development side that we thought would be, sort of, attractive for both of us,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cPeople with skill sets like our\u2019s would typically be more relevant on the publishing side. That\u2019s one of the reasons we didn\u2019t go into games right after school.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut gaming continued to be a big part of their lives, and over time both Merrill and Beck got involved with a few gaming companies. That included becoming advisers to the board of directors for a now-defunct massively multiplayer online game. The two believed in the vision of the company and offered to help it raise money through venture capital funds.\n\nAD\n\nThe work the two did as advisers, Merrill said, taught them a lot about the early days of building a game company.\n\n\u201cWe learned you could be at the right place at the right time with a great idea, but if you can't execute it doesn't matter,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cAnd what ended up happening was the company struggled to build a game that was great because of the lack of mature tech.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBy 2005, the new CEO of that company, now rebranded, reached back out to Beck and Merrill and asked if they could help him work through a buyout and revitalization of the company.\n\n\u201cSo Brandon and I came out there for fun on a weekend and helped him think through that,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cAnd that got us really thinking seriously about, well, where's the industry? What are the trends? Where are things going?\u201d\n\nThe two had recently gotten into playing a popular modification of Blizzard Entertainment\u2019s Warcraft III. The mod, Defense of the Ancients or DOTA, took the real-time fantasy strategy game and created a set of rules that had players controlling two teams of powerful heroes to take out the opposing side\u2019s base. But the mod was an extra download created and maintained by fans that lacked a level of polish and was often hard to find and set up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe thought maybe we could build this sort of DOTA-style game,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cThe more we thought about that the more we were like, \u2018Actually, that\u2019s an incredibly compelling opportunity.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd in their minds, the Warcraft III mod didn\u2019t clear the way just for the birth of a new genre of gameplay known as a multiplayer online battle arena or MOBA, it also proved the viability of a still relatively young concept in gaming: Games as a service. With games as a service, a video game isn\u2019t just developed, released, and then forgotten, it continues to grow, iterating, expanding, offering new content, without ever really releasing a sequel. In that way, the game becomes something more akin to a television series than a single movie.\n\n\u201cDOTA proved that games as a service is something that can really work because it grew virally due to the efforts of great creators, a community of moderators, and a community of volunteers with zero advertising dollars spent,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cIt was just this direct relationship with players and this willingness to evolve and grow the game over time.\u201d\n\nWith the seed of an idea planted, Beck and Merrill got to work.\n\nIntern No. 2\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJeff Jew was a junior studying film at USC\u2019s interactive media lab when he first met Beck and Merrill.\n\n\u201cThey hosted a DOTA tournament at USC. I think the goal was to actually meet students who were interested in games, that were interested in doing game design or [quality assurance] work \u2014 mostly QA work to be honest \u2014 for their new company,\u201d Jew said. \u201cThey were looking for passionate kids that knew this game back to back.\u201d\n\nBut the people who showed up, Jew said, not only didn\u2019t know about this secret goal, but also didn\u2019t really know the game that well. So Jew said he spent much of his time teaching them how to play.\n\nWhen the tournament \u2014 which was really more of an open-ended play session \u2014 wrapped up, Paul Bellezza, another super fan of the original DOTA game, introduced Jew to Beck and Merrill.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018Hey, keep this confidential, but we\u2019re working on a game that is similar to this game,\u201d Jew said. \u201cAnd to me that sounded amazing. I was playing 40 hours of that game a week and they said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you swing by the office next week when you have the time and we\u2019ll do an interview and just see if you\u2019re interested in joining.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was September 2006, and Riot Games had just opened up its offices in an old converted machine shop under an Interstate 405 overpass in Santa Monica. Jew said his interview ended up being a long chat about Warcraft, DOTA, and his playing habits. As soon as it wrapped up, the two offered Jew an $11-an-hour internship.\n\nHe accepted and became Riot Games\u2019 intern number two; Bellezza was the first intern. Jew changed his school schedule to all morning classes and was soon putting in 40 hours a week at Riot.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe studio, he said, consisted of a couple of offices and then a long row of cubicles. In the back, far from the light shed by the single hanging lamp, sat the interns.\n\n\u201cThe walls were bare and it was really dark, especially in the back,\u201d Jew said. \u201cWhen I started there was basically no game.\u201d The game was just as bare-bones as the office, the only thing Riot had to show was a flat plain dissecting a white screen with little skeletons running from one side to the other. \u201cThat was it,\" he said. \"So we were really starting from scratch.\u201d\n\nWhile Jew and Bellezza were the team\u2019s only interns, the company also had Beck, Merrill, and a core team of four which included producers, an engineer and a VFX artist. It wasn\u2019t until the next week that the team got its first concept artist. The team also churned through some interns over the coming months and then, about two months in, Riot Games landed its first coup: They hired Steve \u201cGuinsoo\u201d Feak, one of the original designers of DOTA Allstars.\n\nAD\n\nFeak had handed off development of the mod and returned to school in Wisconsin. At the time he joined Riot, he was working on the Geek Squad at a local Best Buy.\n\n\u201cHe was pretty excited about the concept that we wanted to build a MOBA game unconstrained from Blizzard,\u201d Merrill said.\n\nWhile Feak was a huge hire for Riot Games, he also had no experience working with a group or at a game development studio. His prior work was all done essentially on his own.\n\n\u201cSo learning how to be collaborative and work together and the like, that was all new to everybody there,\u201d Jew said. \u201cWhich was pretty crazy.\u201d\n\nThe group threw themselves into the development of a game they initially called Onslaught. They wrote a massive design document and focused on creating entirely new characters \u2014 the original DOTA used the intellectual property of Blizzard \u2014 while slapping together a demonstration of the game in about four months that could be shown at the 2007 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.\n\nWhile the team showed off the game during GDC, Beck and Merrill met with potential publishers, but the meetings didn\u2019t go well. The biggest issue was that the duo didn\u2019t want to sell the game, instead they wanted to earn money off the back of in-game sales. While the freemium model was starting to gain traction in Asia, it really hadn\u2019t yet been proven in North America.\n\n\u201cWe originally just wanted to be a game developer, but then when we talked to publishers at the time they were like, \u2018Wait, you\u2019re not going to have single player (gameplay) and you want the game to be free and virtual? What are you talking about?\u201d Merrill said. \u201cWe realized that we can\u2019t give them the keys to the kingdom and have them publish it, because we\u2019d fail. This game, this experience, this whole concept needs to have this vertically integrated experience where publishing and development are completely aligned. So then what that means is that we had to go raise venture money, which we thought was unlikely and we were terrified.\u201d\n\nFollowing the show, Beck and Merrill took to the road, hunting up potential venture capital funding, eventually raising $1.5 million from angel investors and family.\n\nAs the two traveled the country, the core team at Riot was starting to fracture. Jew said that most of that original group were focused on building what he calls a \u201cDOTA clone\u201d very quickly, adding that their \u201cquality bar was low,\u201d whereas the rest of the small team was focused on innovating on the existing genre and improving on what was already out there.\n\n\u201cUltimately those ideals really clashed,\u201d Jew said. In early 2008, three of the four members of that core team left, a month later so did the fourth. The remaining team still had the design document for the game and some of the characters, but in many ways those that remained had to start over.\n\nOnslaught became League of Legends: Clash of Fates.\n\nLaunch\n\nOver the summer of 2008, Merrill and Beck\u2019s work seeking funds proved fruitful and the two landed $7 million more in funding from Benchmark and FirstMark Capital venture capital firms. League of Legends was announced on Oct. 7, 2008 and went into closed beta in April 2009. Merrill described those months between announcement and opening the door to the public \u2014 if just by a crack \u2014 as terrifying, and Jew said there were \u201csuper scary\u201d moments.\n\nAs the game faced down the early launch, Jew was in charge of overseeing the creation of the game\u2019s player-controlled champions. Initially, the idea was to ship the game with 20, but after doing a competitive analysis, Beck and Merrill realized that wasn\u2019t enough, so they doubled the requirement.\n\n\u201cThat did put a ton of pressure on me because I had planned on 20 the whole time,\u201d Jew said, \u201cAnd they told me that they were going to do this free-to-play business model, which Brandon has always been talking about, and the way we\u2019re going to make money is to sell cosmetic items called skins.\u201d\n\nThe sale of skins, or new outfits for characters, is now the main way the game generates its billions in revenue each year. But back then, Jew and his team had to come up with 40 characters and extra skins for half of them in time for the approaching launch.\n\n\u201cThe first 20 champions weren\u2019t even done at this time,\u201d Jew said. \u201cThat was a mind-blowing and super scary conversation. We had no idea how to get this done and he said, \u2018Hey, you\u2019ll figure it out.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo Jew brought in an \u201carmy\u201d of paid interns and used them to supplement the work on character design.\n\n\u201cWe had 12 designers, which is actually quite a lot, and I would say about half of those were interns,\u201d he said. \u201cEach designer was working on two champions at the same time and they each only had two months to work with their champions and get them in the game with a crude asset. We were also outsourcing a lot of the assets, it was the only way we could get this done.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, pressure was increasing to make sure the game would hit its early access and launch on time as the studio jetted toward a moment when it would run out of money and simply shut down.\n\nTo make matters worse, other members of that original DOTA team were now working with established developer S2 Games and Frostburn Studios to create their own MOBA. Where League of Legends set out to iterate on that original concept, Heroes of Newerth was working to deliver a more faithful recreation. And both games were aiming to release their earlier builds of the game within months of each other.\n\n\u201cWe were terrified, you know,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cWe had never shipped a game. We\u2019d never built a game. Where S2 was an established game developer. They had shipped a variety of games. They had more mature organizational practices and a more sophisticated dev team with more experience, better tools and technology.\u201d\n\nOnce both games were pushed out for players to try live, things didn\u2019t look good for League of Legends.\n\n\u201cWe felt like we were losing that race the whole time and numbers wise we were,\u201d Jew said. \u201cThey had some good developers. Their art was so much better than ours back then. Their VFX was beautiful.\u201d\n\nBoth games went live with their early builds around the same time, but Heroes of Newerth was pulling in double the number of peak players, Jew said.\n\n\u201cWe thought we were going to lose to these guys for sure,\u201d he said.\n\nBut once both games announced their business models, everything changed.\n\nWhere League of Legends didn\u2019t charge to play the game \u2014 instead relying on in-game purchases, Heroes of Newerth sold like a traditional box game with a fixed price tag. Jew said shortly after Heroes announced its set price, it lost half its players. That was because, Jew theorizes, those players were in Asia or Southeast Asia and either couldn\u2019t afford or didn\u2019t want to spend that money on a game all at once.\n\n\u201cAnd all of those players flipped and they came to League of Legends because we were free to play still,\u201d Jew said. \u201cIt was crazy, we never expected that.\u201d\n\nBut the decision to remain a free-to-play product almost didn\u2019t happen. Jew said that Beck and Merrill were very worried about the concept and were having second thoughts.\n\n\u201cWe were having cold feet like crazy,\u201d Jew said. \u201cWe were doing all the math of how much we would have to sell to earn our money back because we thought we\u2019d only have, you know, 20,000 players. But at the end of the day, Brandon\u2019s like, \u2018Nope, you know what? We\u2019re going to go for it. I think this free-to-play model could work.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn 2009, Riot earned an estimated $1.29 million in revenue according to estimates by SuperData. The following year, that revenue was up to $17.25 million, according to SuperData. And in 2011, Riot Games revenue rocketed to more than $85 million. That same year Chinese gaming and internet giant Tencent Holdings purchased 97 percent of the company for $400 million.\n\nLooking back at that decision, Merrill said he thinks that by giving the game away they were able to eliminate the biggest barrier for people to check out their new product.\n\n\u201cNobody would have tried Legends if we put a price point in front of it because the game is tough to sell,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, once you start to play it, once you kind of get over the hump \u2014 and that hump is big, like 10 or 20 games sometimes \u2014 that\u2019s when you start to appreciate why anybody would think it's cool.\u201d\n\nWhile that decision was an important moment in League of Legends early history, it was just one of many when the wrong idea or wrong approach could have doomed the company.\n\nAfter the game\u2019s launch on Oct. 27, 2009, for instance, Riot struggled to get the online store up and operating and without it the company couldn\u2019t make a penny.\n\n\u201cSpending other people\u2019s money with zero revenue when you have a fixed amount of cash is always a nerve wracking thing,\u201d Merrill said, but the occasional stumble wasn\u2019t completely unique to the company. Merrill said that at least twice in Riot\u2019s history there were moments when the company had less than two months of cash left.\n\n\u201cThere are many, many stories about why the company should have failed,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s not an exaggeration.\n\nJust months into the game\u2019s launch, Riot Games ran into a massive wall in Europe. The company had partnered with a local company to handle the game\u2019s operation there, but players were increasingly unhappy with the game there. Merrill said it was because of their partner didn\u2019t have the same values and simply weren\u2019t invested in the level of support needed there. The result was that players in Europe struggled to log into the game and often ran into technical online issues -- sometimes lasting entire weekends. So Riot convinced the company to hand back control of the game to them in Europe. However that put them on a deadline that gave them 53 days to not just take over operations, but set up their own data centers. They made it, but just barely. Within three months of the May 2010 hand-off, European growth -- which had been well behind North America -- was now 9 percent stronger and growing.\n\nAnother major stumble Riot didn\u2019t just survive, but after which thrived, centered on the company\u2019s incredibly important push into esports.\n\nToday, League of Legends is one of the largest esports in the world, but in 2011 Riot had just started experimenting with the idea of pro play. The company hosted the first season championships at the annual DreamHack celebration in Sweden in June 2011, attracting more than 1.6 million viewers.\n\nThe following year, the company decided to host the Season 2 world playoffs in Southern California. Things were running relatively smoothly until the third day of the live playoffs when a series of internet technical issues derailed a match not once, but again and again. The issues forced the competing teams to play the same match-up over and over for seven hours. Eventually, Riot pulled the plug for the day and had everyone come back the next day to start over.\n\nThat moment, Merrill said became both a \u201ctragedy, but a great rallying cry for the company to get better, to figure out how to solve these things.\u201d\n\nThe end result was an overhaul, and a decision to build an on-site system that would host high-profile tournaments moving forward.\n\nOver the years, as League continued to explode in popularity, potential game-killing problems continued to crop up.\n\nWhile Riot identified toxic, abusive players as a problem back in 2012 \u2014 even going as far as building a Team Player Behavior group lead by scientists to try and solve it \u2014 it continued to be a problem.\n\n\u201cThe number one reason people would stop playing League of Legends was because other people can be jerks online,\u201d Merrill said. \u201cThat\u2019s not our fault, but that\u2019s our problem. I think many companies took the approach of throwing up their hands and saying they can\u2019t do anything about it. We tried to take the approach of, how do we foster a better community?\u201d\n\nIn 2016, the company decided to start focusing a bit more on rewarding players who behaved and less on punishing those that misbehaved.\n\nWhile Merrill said the effort is ongoing, he thinks that a lot of progress has been made.\n\nThen in 2018, gaming site Kotaku delivered a scathing story about the company\u2019s culture, reporting multiple incidents of sexism from a large number of sources at Riot Games. The story \u2014 which detailed unfair treatment of women employees at Riot \u2014 led to an internal investigation, lawsuits, a state fair employment investigation, a walkout, and an effort by the company to improve workplace treatment and culture that included hiring a new chief diversity officer.\n\nFor some outside of the company, the story was a shocking, contrasting view of a company that had once been named one of the top 15 employers in America to work by Fortune. Merrill said the moment became an important opportunity for the company to bring everyone together and establish its values.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve invested a lot in training and we continue to invest more in different types of training around diversity and also how to ensure that people of different backgrounds and contexts can collaborate together, can improve these sort of high quality human interactions and things like that,\" he said.\n\nIn the years to come, Merrill added, he hopes that the company will be able to look back and see this as a \u201dreally positive inflection point that helped us become the company and the employer that we need to be and want to be, because we need to be a great place to work. Otherwise we can\u2019t achieve what we\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead\n\nIn the decade since launch, League of Legends has grown, improved and changed. Where Riot struggled to launch the game with 20 champions, there are now more than 140. Where 20,000 players seemed like an unreasonable high in 2009, League typically has 8 million playing on any given day in 2019. Where the company first set up shop at a tiny machine-shop, now it is based on a 20-acre campus. And where any misstep in those early days could have led to a financial tumble and closure of the studio, Riot earned an estimated $1.7 billion last year on its free game, according to SuperData.\n\nA key to the company\u2019s success, Merrill might argue the key, is the company\u2019s focus on listening to players \u2014 both those who remain ardent supporters but also the game\u2019s vocal critics. But that player-centric focus would be problematic if the studio didn\u2019t also recognize that sometimes the player is wrong.\n\nMerrill calls that one of the \u201cparadoxes and tension points\u201d of working at Riot Games.\n\n\u201cHow do you be player-centric and care about what your customers want but then literally say, \u2018Well, sometimes they\u2019re wrong,\u2019\u201d Merrill said. \u201cIt\u2019s because to me, players are great at problem identification, but often are not great at solutions.\u201d\n\nThis month is a great example of how Riot listens to player concerns, but doesn\u2019t always act upon them in expected ways.\n\nWhere League of Legends most passionate fans might have wanted a company 100-percent focused on the singular game and its evolution, Riot Games instead unveiled work its been doing for years on a slew of new titles, all set in the League\u2019s colorful universe. At an event in Riot\u2019s headquarters earlier this month, the company used the celebration of League of Legends\u2019 10th anniversary as a chance to unveil a half-dozen new projects.\n\nThe decision to mash together the game announcements with the 10-year celebration of League highlights Riot\u2019s underlying belief that while League continues to power the company, these other titles will in their own way power League.\n\n\u201cWe were already planning a separate event called the multi-game announcement that we were kind of talking about for a while,\u201d said Ryan Rigney, communications lead at Riot Games for League of Legends. \u201cI had been working on this 10-year campaign where we were just going to do a lot of cool stuff for League players. And then we decided to ask the entire company to work together and combine all of our game announces and the TV show into this one event.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt became this really kind of wild thing. It\u2019s the first time in Riot\u2019s history that we pulled together everybody \u2014 including the R&D game departments \u2014 into one big campaign.\u201d\n\nThe goal was to deliver what Rigney calls the \u201cmost player-focused game announcement ever.\u201d That meant opening the doors completely to the fans and letting them see just about everything the studio is currently working on. The hope was to also provide a new level of insight into the daily focus of Riot\u2019s thousands of developers.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of players thought that League of Legends was the whole company, where in fact it\u2019s somewhere closer to 20 percent of the company,\u201d said Rigney. \u201cI think players are starting to get a little bit of a grasp of that. When we\u2019re announcing all these games, these are games we\u2019ve been working on for years in a lot of cases. So the company has actually been structured to support multiple games for a long time. It\u2019s just that none of that was obvious. So it\u2019s actually very gratifying for players to have a better understanding of where our heads are at because we just want to be able to talk to players about what we\u2019re doing and have them understand what our goals and priorities are.\u201d\n\nJessica Nam, the executive producer for League of Legends on PC, said that these new games offer fans of League of Legends new ways to interact with their favorite characters and learn more about that.\n\n\u201cWe hope that if you fall in love with the character in one game, that you may be incentivized to try another game, and then you can kind of deepen your love for that character,\u201d she said.\n\nNam\u2019s team spent the month focusing on monitoring the reaction to the news around League of Legends changes and making sure the influx of new players are able to get in and try the title without a problem, she said.\n\nJew, who now heads up Legends of Runeterra \u2014 one of the new titles announced this month \u2014 also sees these new games as new entry points into Riot\u2019s core title.\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of players out there who League of Legends is probably intimidating for,\u201d he said. \u201cThey got in late and they see that there\u2019s now 10 years of it, they see the esport, and they think, \u2018It\u2019s way too late for me to play this game.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut they might be up for a new strategy card game, or one of the other new titles.\n\n\u201cAnd then after you've gotten into the characters and the lore you might jump over to League of Legends and play for the first time. So I think these new games are really adding entry points for players that have been interested in the flavor and the lore of legal legend, but never had a chance to jump in.\u201d\n\nRiot\u2019s goal, Jew said, is for League of Legends to have another decade or two of life. As for the next 10 years, Merrill hopes it will be one driven by what he views as League of Legends\u2019 expansion beyond games to become a sort of lifestyle.\n\n\u201cAbout 75 percent of our players don\u2019t say I play League of Legends, they say I am a League of Legends player,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference between saying I play golf or I like to surf and I\u2019m a surfer. It\u2019s an identity opt-in designation that relates to a lifestyle, and a mindset, and memes, and this community that people are deeply immersed in.\"\n\nBrian Crecente is a freelance writer who has written for The Guardian, Paste Magazine, Wired Magazine, and elsewhere.
