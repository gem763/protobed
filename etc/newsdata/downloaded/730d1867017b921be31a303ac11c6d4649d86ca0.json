NYT Authors Falsely Claimed Silence", "language": "en", "text": "Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly wrote the much-discussed and later-corrected essay in The New York Times making a new sexual misconduct allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The two reporters failed to mention that the alleged victim of the physically improbable tale had never made such a claim, and denied any memory of it through \u201cseveral\u201d friends. They also failed to note that the accusation came from a prominent Democrat who had defended Bill Clinton during the Whitewater investigation on which Kavanaugh served.\n\nA new Atlantic-published, adapted excerpt of the book attempts to resurrect Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s anti-Kavanaugh smears but once again has a major error. \u201cWe Spent 10 Months Investigating Kavanaugh. Here\u2019s What We Found\u201d was published in the Atlantic.\n\nTheir reporting must not have been thorough. In a section explaining why they believe the accusers despite the lack of any evidence, they write that their emotional reaction to the claims was that the claims rang true. But they get major facts wrong:\n\nUsing Martha\u2019s common-sense test, the claims of Deborah Ramirez, while not proven by witnesses, also ring true to us. Ramirez, who was a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s, said he drunkenly thrust his penis at her during a party in their freshman-year dormitory, Lawrance Hall. The people who allegedly witnessed the event\u2014Kavanaugh\u2019s friends Kevin Genda, David Todd, and David White\u2014have kept mum about it. Kavanaugh has denied it. If such an incident had occurred, Kavanaugh said, it would have been the \u201ctalk of campus.\u201d\n\nIt is not true that the alleged witnesses kept mum. This is another major error by The New York Times reporters.\n\nIn the original, much-mocked New Yorker article putting forth Ramirez\u2019s then-shaky claims (she has since firmed up her memories, according to Pogrebin and Kelly), Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer wrote:\n\nOne of the male classmates who Ramirez said egged on Kavanaugh denied any memory of the party. \u2018I don\u2019t think Brett would flash himself to Debbie, or anyone, for that matter,\u2019 he said. Asked why he thought Ramirez was making the allegation, he responded, \u2018I have no idea.\u2019 The other male classmate who Ramirez said was involved in the incident commented, \u2018I have zero recollection.\u2019 In a statement, two of those male classmates who Ramirez alleged were involved in the incident, the wife of a third male student she said was involved, and one other classmate, Dan Murphy, disputed Ramirez\u2019s account of events: \u2018We were the people closest to Brett Kavanaugh during his first year at Yale. He was a roommate to some of us, and we spent a great deal of time with him, including in the dorm where this incident allegedly took place. Some of us were also friends with Debbie Ramirez during and after her time at Yale. We can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about it\u2014and we did not. The behavior she describes would be completely out of character for Brett. In addition, some of us knew Debbie long after Yale, and she never described this incident until Brett\u2019s Supreme Court nomination was pending. Editors from the New Yorker contacted some of us because we are the people who would know the truth, and we told them that we never saw or heard about this.\u2019\n\nPogrebin and Kelly\u2019s work has a pattern of omitting exculpatory evidence that supports Kavanaugh\u2019s consistent claim that he never sexually assaulted anyone. The Atlantic piece is excerpted from the book, which has the same error. Oddly, the book gives the names of the alleged witnesses and quotes their statement, which they characterize as disloyal to Ramirez, on page 140 and page 141.\n\nThis article will be updated once The Atlantic corrects this latest error.", "description": "A new Atlantic-published excerpt of the book attempts to resurrect Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly's anti-Kavanaugh smears but once again has a major error.", "authors": ["Mollie Hemingway"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nytreporters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
