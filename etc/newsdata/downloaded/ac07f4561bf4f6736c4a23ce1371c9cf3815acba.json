Georgia and North Carolina also,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s moving around and very hard to predict, except that it is one of the biggest and strongest (and really wide) that we have seen in decades. Be safe!\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also used his social media account to offer support for Senate Republicans and weigh in on Madeleine Westerhout, the White House assistant fired for her remarks about the Trump family while drinking in an off-the-record setting with reporters.\n\nAlluding to the possibility she might have more to say, Mr. Trump tweeted that Ms. Westerhout has a \u201cfully enforceable confidentiality agreement,\u201d though he doesn\u2019t think \u201cthere would ever be reason to use it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
