Evgeny Kuznetsov, fresh off a three-game suspension, was back and on this occasion, the message from the music was clear: The Capitals center needed to unleash his signature bird celebration.\n\nBut Kuznetsov did not lift his knee and flaps his arms. He did not shout.\n\nInstead, the 27-year-old Russian glided around the net and soon met his teammates who came to celebrate. He smiled.\n\nIn his season debut, Kuznetsov scored the very first goal of the evening just under five minutes into the first period on a backhanded one-timer that went top shelf. By the end of the night \u2014 a 4-3 overtime loss to the Dallas Stars \u2014 Kuznetsov\u2019s grin was gone, but it was still encouraging performance from a player the Capitals desperately need to perform this season.\n\n\u201cYou know I never care about goals,\u201d Kuznetsov said. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a win and be happy tomorrow.\u201d\n\nBut\u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of nice,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie. It\u2019s nice to score right away, especially for me, I never focus on that. I knew I had to respond right away.\u201d\n\nKuznetsov went through a tumultuous offseason. First, the International Ice Hockey Federation banned Kuznetsov from international play for four years after he tested positive for cocaine. The positive test was even more concerning given that a few months earlier, a video leaked showed Kuznetsov in a Vegas hotel room sitting next to a white powdery substance. Kuznetsov denied \u2014 and still denies \u2014 using drugs that evening, but the international suspension was enough to warrant a meeting with commissioner Gary Bettman.\n\nWhile cocaine is not on the NHL\u2019s prohibited substance list, the league still gave Kuznetsov a three-game suspension for \u201cinappropriate conduct.\u201d Meeting with reporters in camp, Kuznetsov apologized publicly and said he would learn from the incident.\n\nKuznetsov\u2019s failed test was the latest disappointment in a disappointing year for the center. Last season, Kuznetsov registered just 72 points \u2014 21 goals and 51 assists\u2014 in 78 games. He was a non-factor in the Capitals\u2019 first-round exit to the Carolina Hurricanes, as well.\n\nCapitals general manager Brian MacLellan called Kuznetsov\u2019s year \u201cfrustrating.\u201d It was also confusing, considering the Russian was so dominant during Washington\u2019s Stanley Cup run in 2018. That year, Kuznetsov scored 12 goals and tallied 20 assists in 20 games.\n\n\u201cHe can do some stuff that very, very few players can do skill-wise,\u201d center Lars Eller said before the game. \u201cHe can take over games that way. He\u2019s got the talent (and) same level as other superstars.\u201d\n\nGetting Kuznetsov to perform as a superstar on a nightly basis will be the challenge moving forward.\n\nWhen Kuznetsov was suspended, he grew tired. Tired of being able to participate in the team\u2019s morning skate \u2014 only to not able to participate in games. Tired of watching the game from the gym inside the bowels of Capital One Arena.\n\nHe hated his new routine.\n\n\u201cWhen (a) game is not coming for a long time, you start doing the same thing over and over,\u201d Kuznetsov said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get better like that.\u201d\n\nWith Kuznetsov back, the Capitals eased him into the action. Coach Todd Reirden centered Kuznetsov on the third line, putting him on a line with Richard Panik and Carl Hagelin. The lines shifted throughout the game, but Reirden said afterward that Kuznetsov would have to re-earn a spot in the top six.\n\nKuznetsov also wasn\u2019t perfect. He committed a crucial penalty late in the third period as the on-ice officials called him for interference. The penalty took away a Capitals\u2019 power play with Washington trailing late. (Washington went on to draw even with 30.7 seconds left before falling in overtime.)\n\nReirden said he liked the impact Kuznetsov had on the third line, though will review it further when he examines the film of Tuesday\u2019s loss.\n\n\u201cIt does give us depth,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cIt gives us a really difficult matchup. \u2026 It\u2019s a matter of finding things that work.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
