The earlier it is, the better the chance it will be a Martini or a Manhattan. If it\u2019s later, I usually keep it to wine or a Highball.\u201d\n\nWhat is the all-time best dive bar jukebox song? \u201c\u201cYou Never Even Called Me By My Name\u201d by David Allen Coe (the long version, with the Steve Goodman bit) and \u201cI\u2019m Bad, I\u2019m Nationwide\u201d by ZZ Top. I could go on.\u201d\n\nAfter all these years bartending and creating drinks, do you still enjoy going out to bars? \u201cI certainly do, though if it\u2019s someplace new with some industry buzz or pedigree, it winds up becoming more work focused. Whereas if I just go to a tried and true saloon, it\u2019s much easier to just relax and have a few.\u201d\n\nName the first good drink you ever drank and where you had it. \u201cInitially, it was probably my parents and their friend\u2019s classic cocktails, which set a proper bar. As for having a drink out, when I was coming up it was steak houses that set the standard. Being raised in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, it was most likely a Martini at the bar in Peter Luger\u2019s. (FYI New York\u2019s drinking age limit was not always 21).\u201d\n\nWhat book on cocktails or spirits is your go-to resource? \u201cLately, I\u2019ve been finding it fun to go through some unheralded compilations, like Stan Jones\u2019 Complete Bar Guide from the \u201870s, and try to unearth or try to improve upon some long-forgotten recipes.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite cocktail and food pairing? \u201cEvery year around my birthday, I try to treat myself to some cold lump crab and a Martini. Just so good. That\u2019s why I celebrate my birthday about once a month.\u201d\n\nWhat drink are you most proud of creating? \u201cI have many that filled holes and bring back memories (and if you\u2019d ask me the same question tomorrow, I\u2019d probably have a different answer) but right now I like the Bagpiper. A unique Scotch-based cocktail, which incorporates Pama Liqueur, cloves and the recently polarizing, orange juice. Don\u2019t hate the orange, man.\u201d\n\nIs there one person (dead or alive) you\u2019d like to make a cocktail for? \u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate to have made a few for some notable folks in my career but I would love to make a \u2018Terence Stamp\u2019 for the man himself. I included the recipe in my book and he sent me a heck of a letter afterward. One of the coolest things ever.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite shot-and-a-beer combination? \u201cIn the summer, I love an easy pilsner with funky rum, tequila or mezcal. In the cooler months, dry cider or darker beers with whiskey works wonders.\u201d\n\nWhat is the one tool that you always make sure to pack when you\u2019re traveling for business? \u201cI have a well-used, large notebook with tons of tips and information that I learned through the years. It\u2019s always around when starting a new project or training staff (although its index can only be found in my mind). I should definitely digitize it soon.\u201d\n\nFrank Caiafa is the director of food and beverage at New York\u2019s Lexington Hotel and the beverage director of its new Stayton Room.
