[Photo/VCG]\n\nWESTERVILLE, Ohio - The 12 Democrats meeting in the fourth presidential debate on Tuesday night found a unifying message right off the bat: Republican Donald Trump is a corrupt president and must be impeached.\n\nThe Democrats were unequivocal on impeachment in their first matchup since the launch of a congressional impeachment inquiry into Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate leading rival Joe Biden.\n\nBiden, who has led the 2020 Democratic race, joined Senator Bernie Sanders in calling Trump \"the most corrupt president in modern history\". The former vice president defended his son Hunter's role on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, which has been criticized by Trump and his supporters.\n\n\"My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\" Biden said.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, who has surged into a virtual tie with Biden in many Democratic opinion polls, said she called for Trump's impeachment after Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings on alleged Russia election interference.\n\nCongress did not move to impeach, she said, \"and look what happened: Donald Trump broke the law again.\"\n\nBillionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, who has poured millions into an impeach-Trump fund since 2017, tipped his hat to his rivals in his first debate.\n\n\"Every candidate here is more decent and coherent and patriotic than that criminal in the White House,\" said Steyer, the last candidate to jump into the race.\n\nWhile all candidates supported the impeachment inquiry, a number warned that could not be Democrats' only message.\n\n\"When we're talking about him we are losing. We need to present a new vision,\" said enterpreneur Andrew Yang.\n\n\"If impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country,\" added Representative Tulsi Gabbard, one of the last to get on board with impeachment.\n\nReuters", "description": "The 12 Democrats meeting in the fourth presidential debate on Tuesday night found a unifying message right off the bat: Republican Donald Trump is a corrupt president and must be impeached.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/16/5da68412a310cf3e97a173b6.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
