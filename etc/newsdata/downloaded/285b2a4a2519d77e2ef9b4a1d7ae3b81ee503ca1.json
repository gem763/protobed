In a Friday filing, the company said it is \u201cchecking some major issues, and the shares will continue to be suspended.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration Wednesday blacklisted several Chinese companies including CSET units Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Co. and Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman & Ship Management Co.\n\nThe parent company, state-owned Cosco Shipping Group, is the world\u2019s biggest shipping operator in terms of fleet and capacity, operating more than 1,100 vessels of all types, including container ships, tankers and bulk carriers. The company is also a key part of Beijing\u2019s multitrillion-dollar \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative that aims to establish infrastructure and distribution channels to help extend China\u2019s influence around the world.\n\nS&P Global Platts reported that at least four VLCCs were chartered as replacement ships by a Chinese oil firm that had earlier booked Cosco Dalian tankers.\n\nOil traders said the switch likely involves China\u2019s Unipec, an arm of refining giant China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. , which replaced at least three oil cargoes from Cosco ships to other operators.\n\nBrokers said they so far have seen more than a dozen ship switches involving big oil cargoes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good for business with a big player virtually out when winter is coming and oil demand is up,\u201d said a Greek owner that runs more than 20 tankers. \u201cWe\u2019ve got urgent inquiries from some of the biggest oil companies\u2019 cargoes, especially out of the U.S., and freight rates are steadily on the rise.\u201d\n\nChina based Huatai Research says Cosco Dalian contributed 39% of CSET\u2019s $66.11 million net profit in the first half. It said some 60% of Dalian\u2019s vessels are subject to the American sanctions.\n\n\u201cAlthough the parent company itself is not on the sanctions list, we are concerned about the potential risks and consequences of being blocked from American banks,\u201c Huatai said. \u201cThey are at the heart of the global financial system, and blocked access to banking transactions or vessel insurance could significantly impact the overall company.\u201d\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the matter said Cosco is asking Beijing to make the blacklisting decision part of the U.S.-China trade talks when those negotiations resume in October. The person said senior Communist Party members consider sanctioning Cosco as a direct jab at the Beijing government itself.\n\n\u201cWe are very surprised and plan to learn more about the situation,\u201d Cosco said in its first response to the U.S. ban.\n\n\u2014Joanne Chiu contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "description": "Shipping brokers around the world are being swamped with calls from oil traders looking for replacement ships after the U.S. blacklisted dozens of tankers operated by a major Chinese tanker operator.", "authors": ["Costas Paris", "Costas.Paris Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-111688/social", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
