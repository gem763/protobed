And, even allowing for that and the difficulty of judging managers from that context, there are equally fair doubts over whether Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Unai Emery are the right men for the jobs.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t quite mean everything is wrong.\n\nThe first thing that can be said for United is that, despite some sloppy moments in this game, despite even Harry Maguire getting caught out for the equaliser, Solskjaer has implemented a defensive idea. There is a structure there, and a solidity.\n\nIt means that, even if they\u2019re not scoring much, they are not conceding much. They give little away.\n\nIt is possible that Liverpool and Manchester City may reveal the myth of this in the manner that Chelsea did when they eventually meet, but right now it is leading to one tangible positive on the table. United\u2019s defensive record remains the joint-third best in the Premier League, only behind Liverpool and Leicester.\n\nIt is one positive Maguire has added to. He does give them greater assurance there, and just makes them more dependable in the air.\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang did disrupt them on Monday, but that\u2019s because he remains Arsenal\u2019s greatest positive. He is by far the best player in the team, and the closest to world-class. It\u2019s actually rather remarkable to think, now, that Arsene Wenger was somewhat reticent on signing him.\n\nBukayo Saka was also hugely impressive alongside him, and there are always signs that some of their other business will come good. Dani Ceballos was once more incisive, and generally improved Arsenal\u2019s attacking shape, while Matteo Guendouzi continues to develop.\n\nIf you want to be kind, and say that the \u201cduck\u201d only really seemed that way because of the deflection of the ball, Granit Xhaka had one of his more solid games.\n\nOn the other side, Scott McTominay continues to show that he is a solid lieutenant for Solskjaer. There has been all manner of discussion over whether he is actually \u201cUnited level\u201d, but that in itself misses a point. Sir Alex Ferguson made a huge virtue out of such players, and always had a core of them in his squads. He realised their value, what they did for cohesion. They could just be depended upon.\n\nThat is the case with McTominay.\n\nIt does seem that, if United have the basis of an idea of a team in that defence, Arsenal have parts of an idea throughout.\n\nThe bigger question for the season is whether the managers can bring this together and make something better \u2013 and whether it is better than the ideas at some of the upwardly mobile sides like Leicester City.\n\nIt\u2019s only then we\u2019ll really know how bad Monday was.", "description": "If it\u2019s now clear that Monday\u2019s meeting at Old Trafford was one of the worst matches between Arsenal\u00a0and Manchester United in the modern era, it does provoke a question where the answer is much less clear.
