Today, the actress posted an insanely badass photo, posing in front of the mirror wearing nothing but a cropped pink and green jacket ... and a strategically placed lobster purse.\n\nHer best friend Sarah Michelle Gellar swooped in with the kind of comment only a best friend can make: \"You know they have medicine for that\" (crabs, get it?!). A commenter replied, \"You're my kind of best friend!\"\n\nBut that isn't even the best part of the photo. Nor is the best part of the photo how Blair is gazing into the mirror, holding her bald head in her hand like it's the seventh wonder of the world. No, the best part of the photo is that Blair's bare rear is just there\u2014all cute and innocent like what's the big deal?!\n\nShe captioned the post, \"Portrait of a lady.\" and credited the photographer Art, who specializes in nude photos, mostly of women, and has shot Blair in the past. In fact, Blair notes in the comments that he is her \"lifelong friend.\" When asked on Instagram why his subjects are mostly women, he responded, \"Because they are beautiful, complex, and compelling. Because I related to them better than men but find them a complete mystery.\"\n\nWithin an hour, the most drew more than 68,000 likes and 3,00 comments. Sarah Hyland chimed in with \"\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d.\" Perez Hilton said, \"I wish I could like this more than once!\" And another rather hilarious fan wrote, \"My family and I call this Pooh bear. No bottoms just a top \ud83d\ude02\"\n\nThis isn't he first time Blair has shown her butt on Instagram, by the way. In a series of diving photos she took after a treatment for multiple sclerosis, the star also showed off her rear en route to the pool.\n\nWe're very much fans of this cheeky content, and hope it continues.\n\nStay updated on the latest science-backed health, fitness, and nutrition news by signing up for the Prevention.com newsletter here.
