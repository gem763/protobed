The 32-gigabyte jet black model is now on clearance and you can buy it for $399 on Apple's website.\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty serious discount, given that the base version of the iPhone 7 cost $649 when it launched in 2016.\n\nThough four iPhones ago may seem like ancient history, the iPhone 7 is no clunky, bygone piece of machinery. It has a 4.7-inch screen, an HD FaceTime camera, Touch ID, slow-mo and time-lapse video settings, and more. It\u2019s also water resistant up to 1 meter for 30 minutes, offers WiFi calling and can play up to 40 hours of audio.\n\niPhone 7 | Courtesy of Apple More\n\nMacworld reported Apple likely dropped the prices because it\u2019s discontinuing the iPhone 7, which is common when the company debuts a new model. The iPhone 7 is no longer featured at the top of Apple\u2019s iPhone homepage, which now only shows the iPhone 11 Pro, the iPhone 11, the iPhone XR and iPhone 8.\n\nBuying a discontinued iPhone 7 may mean you can\u2019t download the newest iOS or access flashy features, but don\u2019t worry \u2014 you can still get it fixed if it breaks. People \u201cmay obtain service and parts from Apple or Apple service providers for 5 years after the product is no longer manufactured,\u201d according to Apple\u2019s website. (So you\u2019ve got a while to go.)\n\nSeveral retailers are selling their iPhone 7 models at similarly reduced prices. At Walmart, you can buy an AT&T prepaid iPhone 7 with 32 gigs of storage space and a $50 airtime bundle for $349.99. If you buy a prepaid Net10 iPhone 7, the price dips to $299.99.\n\nA Total Wireless iPhone 7 is $299.99 at Best Buy, as well. You can score a Simple Mobile prepaid iPhone 7 on Amazon for $299.99, too \u2014 and you can get it in gold.\n\nFor comparison, the iPhone 11 starts at $699. However, if your heart is set on nabbing that brand-new model, there is one way to save money: Look into trading in your old Apple devices for a credit. Preorders for the iPhone 11 start Friday.\n\nWe\u2019ve included affiliate links into this article.
