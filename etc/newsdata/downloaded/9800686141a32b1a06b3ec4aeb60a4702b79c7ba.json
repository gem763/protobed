Unfortunately it had the opposite effect, sparking social media frenzy and calls for crowd-funding appeals for my fee so the nation could submit me to endless humiliations.\n\n'Gary Lineker\u2019s sudden penchant for savage violence was a tad surprising given he famously never even got a yellow card as a player, suggesting he\u2019s not the most combative of souls'\n\nAmanda Holden was almost beside herself with excitement. \u2018You HAVE to say yes!\u2019 she exclaimed. \u2018The weight loss would be AMAZING!\u2019 But the truth is I could never do it, even for a crazy-sized cheque, because my long-suffering parents would disown me. \u2018You\u2019ve put us through a lot of\u2026 interesting challenges,\u2019 my mother once said diplomatically during a family lunch, \u2018but I don\u2019t think we could survive you in that dreadful jungle.\u2019\n\nMy father concurred. \u2018Please son,\u2019 he pleaded, \u2018we can cope with most things, but not you munching kangaroo testicles on TV.\u2019\n\nTHURSDAY, OCTOBER 3\n\nThe new issue of Bella magazine has the screaming headline \u2018PIERS RISKING HIS MARRIAGE FOR SUSANNA?\u2019 followed by: \u2018Wife\u2019s fury over flirting.\u2019\n\nThis obviously came as news to both my Good Morning Britain co-star, who viewed it as very damaging to her brand that anyone might think she finds me remotely attractive, and Celia, who never watches GMB so has no idea who I flirt with and cares even less.\n\nLots of celebrities find these kinds of absurd and untrue magazine covers deeply offensive, but I think they\u2019re hilarious and enjoy pouring petrol on to the fake flames. \u2018I\u2019ve tried to tell him it\u2019s destroying my self-esteem,\u2019 Celia joked with my encouragement, after posting the cover on Instagram, \u2018but it\u2019s a compulsion, an addiction, and it\u2019s tearing our family apart.\u2019 That should land us another cover.\n\nFRIDAY, OCTOBER 4\n\nGary Lineker was asked by the SPORTBible website which famous person he\u2019d most like to punch. \u2018Piers Morgan!\u2019 he chortled without a moment\u2019s hesitation. Then he added: \u2018I\u2019d electrocute him as well.\u2019\n\nMr Lineker\u2019s sudden penchant for savage violence was a tad surprising given he famously never even got a yellow card as a player, suggesting he\u2019s not the most combative of souls. \u2018You couldn\u2019t punch your way out of a crisp packet,\u2019 I sneered at the long-time Walkers frontman.\n\n\u2018Actually, that\u2019s probably true,\u2019 he agreed.\n\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 5\n\nTalking of goody-two-shoes footballers, few are nicer than Jamie Redknapp, so I was somewhat surprised to receive an unprompted text from him saying: \u2018Will you please stop banging on in the morning, embarrassing.\u2019 Puzzled by this shocking rudeness from someone normally so polite, I checked Jamie\u2019s Instagram story, only to discover he is currently filming A League Of Their Own in Munich.\n\nI did the maths. \u2018Evening Fred,\u2019 I replied.\n\n\u2018P***k\u2019 came the response.\n\nJamie, take better care of your phone please, especially when Mr Flintoff is nearby.\n\nSUNDAY, OCTOBER 6\n\nI\u2019ve been thoroughly enjoying Sir Elton John\u2019s riveting autobiography, in which he reveals all sorts of saucy secrets about the royals, including Princess Diana flirting with Richard Gere and Sylvester Stallone, and the Queen slapping Lord Linley.\n\nCuriously, Prince Harry hasn\u2019t blown a gasket about this sensational invasion of his family\u2019s privacy.\n\nBut then he and his wife Meghan holidayed with Sir Elton in August, cadging a lift on the pop star\u2019s private jet while lecturing us all about the environment. So I guess it would be a bit tricky for Harry to hold him to the same standards he holds us ghastly press people!\n\nMONDAY, OCTOBER 7\n\nRather lower down the pop star food chain, Andrew Ridgeley appeared on GMB a year ago and threw his toys out of the pram when I asked about his late, great Wham! bandmate George Michael.\n\nRidgeley grimaced theatrically as he refused to discuss him, attracting praise on social media for his \u2018dignity\u2019 in the face of my \u2018appallingly intrusive\u2019 questioning.\n\nNow he\u2019s released a book in which he bangs on about George for page after tedious page, including lurid revelations about his sexuality. Turns out it wasn\u2019t \u2018dignity\u2019 that prevented principled Mr Ridgeley talking to me about George Michael \u2013 it was cold, hard cash.\n\nTUESDAY, OCTOBER 8\n\nLord Sugar\u2019s had a knee replacement and is even grumpier than usual, firing off angry group WhatsApp messages to friends like me complaining about the pain and containing graphic footage of his surgery.\n\nThe Apprentice host\u2019s mood has not been helped by his self-imploding football team Tottenham Hotspur conceding ten goals in two games. Today, he sent round a clip of himself doing rehab on a stationary bike, so slowly it would shame a tortoise. \u2018Congrats,\u2019 I replied, \u2018you\u2019re moving faster than Spurs\u2019 defence.\u2019\n\nWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 9\n\nThis column has impressively managed to avoid any award nominations throughout its 13-year history. So I was stunned to learn I\u2019ve been shortlisted as Columnist of the Year by the prestigious British Society of Magazine Editors.\n\nThis was particularly unexpected as the last time I attended the BSME awards night was in 2005, when I was the host and was booed, jeered and heckled into humiliating oblivion.\n\nOne guest, Emma Duncan from The Economist, observed in a withering report of my performance: \u2018Some speakers are virtuous but dull; some are entertaining but nasty. Mr Morgan was unusual, in that he combined dullness with nastiness. I say this without malice, but with the express purpose of reducing his market value to the point where he gives up, and nobody again has to sit through what we did.\u2019\n\nI guess my output has improved!", "description": "Gary Lineker was asked by the SPORTBible website which famous person he'd most like to punch.
