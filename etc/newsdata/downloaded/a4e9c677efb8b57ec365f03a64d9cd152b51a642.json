They were told to block off an hour on their calendars for serious food business.\n\n\u201cWe first started getting into the Pasta Pass four years ago. I thought it was kind of a joke when we first saw the advertisement \u2014 unlimited pasta seemed crazy,\u201d Blanton, 28, told FOX Business. \u201cPasta is definitely my favorite food, hands down; there\u2019s no close second.\u201d\n\nThis year was an especially tall order: securing Olive Garden's new $500 Lifetime Pasta Pass, which went on sale in August offering just 50 people the chance to eat the restaurant's pasta, soup, salad and breadsticks for life. Guests entering had to be fast \u2014 last year's pasta passes sold out in less than one second.\n\nBlanton and his team leveraged their tech-savvy skills to secure the limitless carb access. The strategy, he said, is strength in numbers, multiple devices, and a furious amount of mouse clicks as soon as the site went live.\n\n\u201cWe typically do a couple devices. I had two laptops set up this year, and we also used our cell phones. Every single person on my team is logged on to multiple devices trying to get these pasta passes,\u201d Blanton said, adding that he uses an Ethernet internet connection because it\u2019s more stable than Wi-Fi. \u201cWe usually refresh a minute before it goes on sale just to make sure our computers are connected to the internet.\u201d\n\nBlanton and his team used the web browser extension LastPass, a password manager that stores encrypted passwords online, that way, all of his personal information like name, address and credit card number are stored so he can quickly enter to win a pass and click to check out. It worked -- he was the 46th person out of 50 people to secure a Lifetime Pasta Pass.\n\n\u201cIt all wasn\u2019t more than a couple seconds from the time I was on the checkout page to the time I completed it,\" Blanton explained.\n\nHis other colleagues won big too. Nine of them landed a Never Ending Pasta Pass, which offers customers nine weeks of unlimited pastas and sauces from Olive Garden\u2019s Never Ending Pasta Bowl menu for $100 plus tax (they sold out in one second this year, the company said).\n\nBlanton says people can apply the same strategy he did for other limited spot openings, like a gym class, restaurant reservations or any giveaway.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nBlanton, who also won the Unlimited Pass last year, says it saved him hundreds of dollars on lunch in the past. Last year, he ate at Olive Garden up to 40 times over the nine-week period. His go-to order is whole grain linguini with creamy garlic sauce.\n\n\u201cI probably save up to $300 a year, and that\u2019s including the $100 that pays for it,\u201d Blanton said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "How this IT team scores Olive Garden's Never Ending Pasta Pass every year.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Lifetime-pasta-2.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
