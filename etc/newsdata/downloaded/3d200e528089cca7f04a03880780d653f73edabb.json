But as anyone who has ever seen a comic book movie can tell you: with great power comes great responsibility. That's why we're calling on you to use your massive platform and influence to join us in our fight to build safer communities with fewer guns.\"\n\nThe letter asked the studio to lobby for gun reform, help fund survivor funds and gun violence intervention schemes, and end political contributions to candidates who take money from the National Rifle Association.\n\nImage copyright Warner Bros Image caption The film depicts the disturbing transformation of clown and comedian Arthur Fleck\n\nIn its response, the studio said it has \"a long history of donating to victims of violence\", including the 2012 cinema shooting in Aurora, Colorado.\n\nIt added: \"Make no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.\"\n\nJoker, which is released in the US on 4 October, has received rave reviews and has been tipped for Oscar nominations, but is also stirring controversy for its portrayals of mental illness and violence. It shows the origin story of Batman's nemesis.\n\nTime magazine's Stephanie Zacharek said it was guilty of \"aggressive and possibly irresponsible idiocy\", while Variety's reviewer Owen Gleiberman said the film \"does something that flirts with danger - it gives evil a clown-mask makeover, turning it into the sickest possible form of cool\".\n\nIndieWire's critic David Ehrlich wrote that there were \"moments of shocking violence\", and that the \"story can't help but feel aspirational\".\n\nPhoenix, who plays the title role, left an interview with the Telegraph when he was asked if he was worried that the film might end up inspiring the kind of people it's about, with potentially tragic results. He later returned, explaining that he was thrown because the question hadn't crossed his mind.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
