She wanted to get through university to honour her dad and do the best she could.\n\n\u2018She had so many plans for the future and everything she wanted to do.\u2019\n\nMrs Bone said she wanted to warn others, particularly young girls, about the dangers of extreme dieting, adding: \u2018Please be careful.\u2019\n\nLindsey\u2019s body was examined by pathologist Dr Catherine Guy and most tests returned \u2018normal\u2019 results.\n\nMandy Bone issued a warning to other girls, telling them to \u2018please be careful\u2019 (Picture: Getty Images/ iStockphoto)\n\nThe prescribed anti-depressant and anxiety medication found in her system was described as not exceeding a \u2018normal, therapeutic dose\u2019.\n\nDr Guy stated that the only positive finding from blood tests was a \u2018slightly high acid level in the blood\u2019, which is called acidosis.\n\nShe said: \u2018It was not at a level we would normally consider as a fatal level but it was a lot higher than usual.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Your body has a natural way of balancing acid and alkali and that can be affected by diet, very high protein and low fat diets, especially if there has been fasting.\n\nStudent wears 'Maddy is in my freezer' on T-shirt at bar crawl\n\n\u2018Apple cider vinegar is a food supplement. There is not much information on the effect it could have. Obviously the vinegar is acidic and we don\u2019t know how many she was taking at once.\n\n\u2018The only serious effects in the past have been when people have had a lot of vinegar.\u2019\n\nIt was noted that Lindsey\u2019s supplements could have reacted with her medication, but the doctor deemed it unlikely.\n\nMs Hamilton-Deeley stated that Lindsey\u2019s death was a \u2018mystery\u2019, stating that the only two conclusions would be natural causes or misadventure.\n\nShe continued: \u2018On the balance of probability I can record it is likely cardiac arrhythmia. I don\u2019t know what has caused it.\n\n\u2018What might have contributed is the anxiety and depression because of what she had been prescribed. They might not be 100% good.\n\n\u2018Any prescription carries an element of risk. We can\u2019t avoid the risks we don\u2019t know about.\u2019\n\nThe coroner added: \u2018We have talked about the apple cider vinegar but there were other things she took and there is the possibility that on that day, a day of dieting, there was some interaction but I don\u2019t know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I am going to leave the conclusion open and I can\u2019t do anything but offer you condolences on the loss of an extraordinary young woman. It is not satisfactory but I fear it is the best I can do.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
