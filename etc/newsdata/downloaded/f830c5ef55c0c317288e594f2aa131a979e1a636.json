McQuillan's latest tweet suggests that British Airways treated McQuillan and her fellow cabin attendants to a drink in the BA lounge, before helping get the ex-Thomas Cook employees home.\n\nCNN Travel reached out for BA to comment on its involvement with the repatriation effort.\n\n\"We are one of number of airlines supporting the CAA with its efforts to bring Thomas Cook customers and crew back home to the UK,\" said a BA spokesperson. \"We will help as much as we can in the coming days.\"\n\nOther airlines assisting include Virgin Atlantic, who've set up a dedicated helpline for passengers and pledged to return crew and travelers stuck in Cuba, Jamaica and the United States.\n\nSome ex-Thomas Cook cabin crew have taken to Twitter to thank Virgin Atlantic staff for welcoming them on board under the distressing circumstances.\n\nIt's been an emotional roller coaster for many ex-Thomas Cook cabin crew, some of them are even assisting with the repatriation efforts, the CAA confirms to CNN.\n\nVideos surfaced on Twitter of cabin crew fighting back the emotions to aid passengers getting home and passenger showing their appreciation via applause.\n\nRepatriation continues\n\nThe CAA announced yesterday that 94% of Thomas Cook customers due to fly back to the UK on 24 September had been successfully transported back home.\n\n\"So far, we have brought over 95% of people back to the UK on the original day of departure of their Thomas Cook flight,\" says the CAA in an online statement.\n\nA representative for the CAA told CNN Travel that the majority of those who've not been brought back via the CAA chose not to take the repatriation flight and had instead booked themselves on alternative flights.\n\nThe British effort will continue through Sunday October 6.\n\nRelated content What travelers affected by the Thomas Cook collapse need to know\n\n\"I would like those remaining on holiday to enjoy the rest of their stay because we aim to also fly you home on the day when you were originally booked to fly with Thomas Cook, or very shortly thereafter,\" said Richard Moriarty, chief executive of the CAA.\n\n\"This remains a highly complex operation and I would like to thank holidaymakers for their patience as some inconvenience and disruption is likely.\"\n\nCAA has a \"guidance by destination\" landing page that directs traveler towards departure airports and offers information about new flights.\n\nIf you're stuck abroad and experiencing accommodation issues, the CAA spokesperson tells CNN Travel their official advice is not to pay again -- and to instead call and notify that you are experiencing issues.", "description": "Efforts to rescue people stranded by the collapse of UK travel company Thomas Cook are set to continue into next month, as holidaymakers reported being locked in hotels and flight crews struggled to get home.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F190923090740-08-thomas-cook-brexit-0923-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
