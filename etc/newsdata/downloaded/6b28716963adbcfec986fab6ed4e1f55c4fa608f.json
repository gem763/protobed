It\u2019s an eye-opener, and one that few of her (mostly) male detractors, who have taken to dismissively branding her an \u201cambulance chaser\u201d or \u201cmedia whore,\u201d have even scratched the surface of.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all about empowerment,\u201d she says. \u201cWords will never stop me.\u201d\n\nIn the mid-\u201860s, Allred split from her husband after his bipolar disorder began posing a threat to their child\u2019s well-being. A single mother, she moved with her young daughter, Lisa, from Philadelphia to sunny California. Shortly thereafter, and needing to blow off some steam, she took a trip with one of her girlfriends to Acapulco. There, she met a striking physician who was to take her out for a night on the town\u2014but first, he said, he had to make some house calls. He guided Allred into a house, only no one was home. The man brandished a gun. Then he raped her.\n\nIt gets worse. The attack left her pregnant, and it being the 1960s, a safe, legal abortion wasn\u2019t an option. So Allred was forced into a back-alley abortion. She went alone. The procedure left her hemorrhaging, and, losing considerable blood, she checked herself into the hospital, where she was placed in a ward with numerous other women who\u2019d received the same procedure. Many of them didn\u2019t make it. As Allred lay in recovery, the nurse tending to her looked her dead in the eye and said, \u201cThis will teach you a lesson.\u201d\n\nAllred has, in the decades since, became not just a champion for women, but for minorities, too. She\u2019s taken on the Catholic Church, the Friars Club, the TSA, you name it. In 1995, she became a household name after representing the family of Nicole Brown Simpson during O.J.\u2019s murder trial; in 2004, she filed the first lawsuit to challenge the same-sex marriage laws in California, on behalf of her longtime pals Robin Taylor and Diane Olson. (The California Supreme Court ruled in their favor, setting an important legal precedent in the fight to legalize same-sex marriage.)\n\n\u201c I represent numerous persons who allege they are victims of Harvey Weinstein, and some of them allege that they were the victims of inappropriate conduct here as well. At Sundance. \u201d \u2014 Gloria Allred\n\nAnd at 76, she shows no signs of slowing down. In recent years, Allred, who\u2019s been dubbed the \u201cmaster of the press conference,\u201d has garnered headlines for representing 33 of Bill Cosby\u2019s sexual-assault accusers; several women accusing the director Roman Polanski, film executive Harvey Weinstein, and politician Roy Moore of sexual-assault; and three women who\u2019ve accused Donald Trump of sexual-assault. She\u2019s currently representing The Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos in a defamation suit against President Trump, after he called her a liar for claiming to have been assaulted by him at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2007\u2014the same hotel where he allegedly rendezvoused with porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nOh, and if that weren\u2019t enough, she\u2019s the subject of an inspiring new documentary Seeing Allred, that debuted at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival and will be out Feb. 9 on Netflix. The film, directed by Roberta Grossman and Sophie Sartain, chronicles Allred\u2019s journey from working-class Philly to celebrity attorney.\n\nI sat down with Allred at Sundance to discuss the doc and her storied career.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that this documentary is premiering at Sundance, because this is the place where Rose McGowan alleges that Harvey Weinstein raped her.\n\nI represent numerous persons who allege they are victims of Harvey Weinstein, and some of them allege that they were the victims of inappropriate conduct here as well. At Sundance. But I can\u2019t discuss them further.\n\nThe McGowan episode is said to have happened in 1997. It\u2019s 21 years later. One of the major fest themes this year is courageous women, with documentaries on Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Jane Fonda, and yourself, and the Respect Rally that you spoke at. There seems to have been a seismic shift both at this festival and beyond with the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements\u2014it seems to have a lot to do with the election of President Trump?\n\nI think this wave has been building for many years. Women have been speaking out long before the #MeToo movement\u2014although that\u2019s been important\u2014and many of them have been speaking out with me because they want their voices to be heard, and because they demand change. But I think the wave has become a tsunami, and we\u2019re never going to be the same again. We\u2019re not going to be silent anymore, because the cost of silence, they have assessed, is greater than the cost of speaking out. It\u2019s really harmed them emotionally in many cases, it\u2019s harmed them economically, and in some cases they allege they\u2019ve been harmed physically as a result of trying to keep all that rage and anger about what they\u2019ve been forced to suffer within them. So I encourage them not to tranquilize themselves out of their anger and their rage but to take that as a source of energy and have it help them move forward in a positive, constructive way. It may be too late for them to sue or too late for law enforcement to assist them in any way, but it\u2019s not too late for them to speak out, to demand legislative changes, to run for office, and to fight for change.\n\nBut the election of Trump seems to be the thing that lit the fuse, no? When you elevate a man to the highest office in the land who\u2019s been accused of sexual-assault by 19 women, and who\u2019s on tape bragging about assaulting women\u2014and who\u2019s said very ugly things to you, when he said you\u2019d be \u201cvery very impressed\u201d with his manhood...\n\nYeah, well, you might notice who prevailed in that battle. We demanded that [trans contestant Jenna Talackova] be put back in the beauty pageant and to remove the rule that you have to be a naturally-born female, and he did put her back and he did remove the rule, and of course ultimately said he was going to do that anyway.\n\nAnd I mean\u2026a year or two later, after we won that battle, I happened to see him at Fox News in the green room. He was on a show before I was. I was sitting there with another client and about to come on a show, and he comes in, and I thought, oh my goodness, what\u2019s he going to say to my client? So he says, \u201cOh, Gloria. I heard you were here.\u201d He turns to my client and says, \u201cMiss so-and-so, I just want you to know: you have the best lawyer. This woman is relentless. She will never stop until she wins you the justice you think you deserve, so never, ever fire her because you will never get anyone better.\u201d I was astounded, given that we\u2019d just won that battle. And I\u2019ve never seen him since.\n\nWhat\u2019s the status of the fundraising for Summer Zervos\u2019 defamation suit against President Trump? I\u2019d read that you were at $30,000 in donations at the beginning of this month.\n\nWell, we\u2019re actually not engaged in fundraising. What we have done is we\u2019ve put on our webpage that if people want to contribute, they can. But we\u2019ve done no fundraising activities, mailers or any of that. So many people have asked us if they can donate, and where they can donate, and we certainly welcome it because the costs of litigating a case\u2014forget the fees, I\u2019m not charging for my fees\u2014against the President of the United States and his billionaire friends, some of whom may or may not be contributing to him, this is a huge endeavor. We need the support of the public, if they wish to provide it, but I\u2019m not going out actively soliciting [donations], because I\u2019m very busy with the cases.\n\nWhat did you think about The New York Times piece late last month? It accused you and your daughter of partisanship\u2014basically, a left-wing conspiracy\u2014in receiving donations from prominent Democratic allies, like David Brock, in pursuing lawsuits against Trump.\n\nI remember the piece you\u2019re talking about. It mixed up a lot of things that really weren\u2019t related. Let me be clear: David Brock hasn\u2019t contributed one cent to us.\n\nThat money went to your daughter, Lisa Bloom.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s received or what she hasn\u2019t received, but not one cent went to me or any of my clients. And that\u2019s all I can say.\n\nHow confident are you that Summer Zervos\u2019 defamation case against Trump will go forward, and that you\u2019ll be able to depose the President of the United States?\n\nWe\u2019re waiting for the court\u2019s decision. I\u2019ll say that I am hopeful, but there are very complicated legal issues involved. We\u2019ve made our arguments, he\u2019s made his motion to dismiss the arguments, we\u2019ve made our arguments in opposition, they\u2019ve replied, and now we\u2019re waiting to see what the court will do. The judge appears to be a very bright judge who asked the right questions from both sides. It\u2019s going to be a battle.\n\nTrump\u2019s defense is interesting here. His team is arguing that what Trump says is protected by the First Amendment, and that the statements he makes at rallies to rouse people don\u2019t have to be entirely truthful.\n\nI\u2019m glad you mentioned what you just said, because the reason we filed this lawsuit is because we believe the truth matters. That\u2019s the reason. We believe truth matters, and we believe that if a person believes\u2014or has reason to believe\u2014that they were defamed, they should have a right to pursue the person that defamed them.\n\nHas President Trump\u2014or any of his intermediaries\u2014settled or attempted to settle with any of your clients?\n\nNot to my knowledge.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Stormy Daniels\u2019 reported $130,000 settlement with Trump? The whole situation is interesting, because Trump\u2019s longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, is alleged to have created a company in order to transfer the settlement funds surreptitiously.\n\nI\u2019ll just say that I did not represent her in any settlement, and therefore I have no comment if there was a settlement. But it\u2019s definitely\u2026an interesting issue. But I will say, with the film, I hope that people who see Seeing Allred understand that they can take on in their own lives people who are powerful that have hurt them. Whether these people are celebrities in the political world, the entertainment world, the sports world, the education world, they religious world, they can take this as a teaching moment and say, wait, I can stand up and do something about the injustice that has been inflicted upon me by this powerful person. That, for me, is what it\u2019s all about.\n\nI wanted to ask about your daughter, Lisa Bloom. There\u2019s a very brief scene in the film that mentions how she worked for accused predators Harvey Weinstein and Roy Price, and it was later revealed how she provided opposition research in response to Ronan Farrow\u2019s queries in an attempt to smear Weinstein\u2019s alleged victims. What are your thoughts on her decision?\n\n[Silence]\n\nIt seemed, at least to me, like she got blinded a bit by the Hollywood element. Harvey Weinstein was opting her book for a potential film or television project. A similar thing happened with Hillary Clinton, who was developing a project with Weinstein up until the sexual-assault allegations surfaced.\n\nMy daughter has her own law firm. She decides who she\u2019s taking on as clients and who she\u2019s not. I have nothing to do with those decisions, and she doesn\u2019t decide who I take as clients or don\u2019t take as clients. So all I can say is I love her, I support her\u2014she\u2019s a wonderful lawyer\u2014and I have no comment on that other than to say I\u2019m proud of my daughter, and she\u2019s doing what she can to help victims.\n\nOnce you learn the full breadth of your story, it seems extra insidious when you see powerful men\u2014and it is mainly men\u2014criticizing you, a person who\u2019s been assaulted, for primarily defending women who have been assaulted, harassed or discriminated against by men.\n\nI will say that I do want to give credit and recognition to many men who come up to me and say, \u201cI have daughters. Thank you. I know you\u2019re waging this fight for my daughters.\u201d I do think that many men who care about their daughters understand that, but look, it\u2019s about education. There\u2019s always going to be some individuals who are not well informed, who want women to be subordinated, who want women to be denied their rights, and who want women to live as second-class citizens. But I\u2019m about real change. I\u2019m about empowering persons who are victims and minorities who are denied their rights, so I just think of the brave suffragists before me who fought in the United States for 72 years just to win the right to vote. I know what herstory is. What they went through was far more of an act of courage than what I\u2019ve been engaging in for 42 years, and they were not deterred by being called names or being accused of falsehoods. That doesn\u2019t deter me, either.", "description": "The famed attorney opens up to Marlow Stern about the new documentary \u2018Seeing Allred,\u2019 the #MeToo movement, and the ongoing defamation suit against the president.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1516623761/180121-stern-alfred-lede_kfi99l", "published_at": "2018-01-22"}
