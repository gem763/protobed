Six people so far have died.\n\nLast week, the CDC reported 450 cases of lung illness that state and federal investigators linked to electronic devices used to vape nicotine and cannabis-based products. That number was reduced Thursday after the CDC changed its definition to count only breathing illnesses with abnormal chest x-rays, a recent history of vaping, and lab work done to rule out infectious diseases or other possible causes.\n\nHealth officials say the outbreak does not seem to be caused by an infection, and the leading suspect is chemical exposure.\n\nExperts warn: Trump's proposed ban on vape flavors may not stop teens from vaping\n\nAlthough no single substance or product has been pinpointed for the illnesses, most patients have said they used e-cigarettes with THC, the main psychoactive chemical in marijuana. Many also said they were vaping nicotine, with or without THC.\n\nFederal and state investigators said last week one of the most common threads in reported cases of the \"severe pulmonary disease\" was street-purchased tetrahydrocannabinol or THC oil from marijuana that contained vitamin E acetate.\n\nBut investigations are ongoing and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised even adults to \"consider not using e-cigarettes\" as they investigate the illnesses. Those who continue to use the products should monitor themselves for symptoms including cough, shortness of breath and nausea and promptly seek medical attention for any health concerns, CDC said.\n\nPick up a joint instead: Vaping illnesses highlight flawed marijuana regulations\n\nMonday, the FDA warned nicotine-vaping industry giant Juul to cease making claims that the company's products are safer than tobacco smoking. Tuesday, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg launched a $160 million program to \"combat the youth e-cigarette epidemic.\" Goals include banning all flavored e-cigarette and stopping Juul and other e-cigarette companies from marketing their products to children.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday he will seek to ban the sale of flavored vaping products in an effort to get young people to give up the potential dangers of e-cigarettes. That same day, a state lawmaker in New Jersey rolled out plans to make the state the first in the country to ban the sale of all vaping products.\n\nIt's not yet known exactly what is driving the recent spate of illnesses, but here are answers to a few basic questions:\n\nWhat is vaping?\n\nAlso known as e-cigarette use, battery-operated delivery devices heat liquid pods, which are nearly always flavored, to create a vapor that users can inhale. These pods are typically packed with nicotine. Some advocates hail vaping as a safer alternative to tobacco smoking but anti-tobacco groups warn of unknown health consequences and the risk of creating a new generation addicted to nicotine.\n\nVaping has been around for a decade but became widely known last year when its use by teens was declared an epidemic by then-Food and Drug Administration chief Dr. Scott Gottlieb. In 2018, 3.6 million high school and middle school students described themselves as active e-cigarette users. E-cigarette use among high schoolers last year surged 78% from the prior year, according to a national survey.\n\nThe devices also are used to inhale THC from cannabis both from legal recreational and/or medical sources, as well as from black market by street dealers.\n\nGottlieb required vaping manufacturers submit products for review by 2021. But anti-tobacco and public health groups sued the agency and a federal judge moved the deadline to seek federal approval for vaping products up to May 2020. Public health groups applauded the accelerated timelines but still worry about the alarming number of underage vapers.\n\nWhat prompted the recent attention to vaping-related lung illnesses?\n\nPhysicians and government officials started really paying attention to vaping-related lung illnesses in July, when reports of teens who vaped nicotine and THC being hospitalized emerged in Wisconsin. Illinois reported the first death earlier this month. Many state health officials are now checking their records to see if they can find earlier cases that could also be added to the case count. Doctors, plaintiff lawyers and those working in the cannabis industry say they have seen and heard reports of illnesses in young people dating back several years, many involving people who only vaped nicotine. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on two patients in 2015 who were believed to have contracted pneumonia from vaping.", "description": "Have a serious talk with your children if you suspect or know they vape nicotine or THC and consult with their doctor about how to help them quit.", "authors": ["Jayne O'Donnell", "Ken Alltucker", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YUrnM6uM_eSzrD15d1ykzQ--~B/aD0zMzEyO3c9NDk2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/ef7771139f9947226d5be6827bda41f9", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
