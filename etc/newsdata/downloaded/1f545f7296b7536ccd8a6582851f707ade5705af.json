Photos: Kenneth Chan\n\nThe Sha Tin all-weather surface may often be shunned by punters and looked upon as biased, but trainer Frankie Lor Fu-chuen relishes the opportunity to race his horses on it.\n\nLor\u2019s numbers in just his third season of training are incredible \u2013 he has 135 career victories \u2013 but his record improves considerably when his horses race on the dirt.\n\nLor\u2019s career strike rate on turf is a respectable 12 per cent but that improves to 24 per cent on the all-weather surface and he boasts a host of top-line dirt specialists which will step out at Sha Tin on Sunday afternoon.\n\nAll-weather meetings at Sha Tin are usually reserved for Wednesday nights but the ongoing social unrest in Hong Kong has forced the Jockey Club to move its annual daytime Happy Valley meeting to the safer confines of Sha Tin.\n\nWith Sha Tin\u2019s grass currently out of action after being trimmed bare to allow the winter grass to grow through in time for the international races, the Jockey Club was left with no option but race the entire card on dirt.\n\nLor\u2019s smart four-year-old Coby Oppa will have his first start for the season in the Class Three Guangzhou Handicap (1,200m) after being withdrawn from racing with a fever in September.\n\n\u201cHe had a temperature when we tried to race him last time, there was something going around quite a few of the stables so he had to be withdrawn,\u201d Lor said.\n\nCoby Oppa on the line! @KarisTeetan pushes Frankie Lor's gelding out to deny Red Desert and Joao Moreira in the last stride. #HKracing pic.twitter.com/qZvjbdTpfR \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) July 7, 2019\n\n\u201cHe is much better now, we have Joao [Moreira] riding as well so we are looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nLor said his horses enjoyed the softer all-weather surface as it was more forgiving over a long season.\n\n\u201cThat is why I like to race them on the all-weather when I can, it is easier on their joints,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen pressed on his lethal strike rate on the all-weather, Lor remained coy, adamant there were no different training techniques he used to get them to fire on the surface.\n\n\u201cMy horses are just happier on there,\u201d he laughed.\n\nCoby Oppa will clash with Ricky Yiu Poon-fai\u2019s own dirt specialist Encore Boy, who returns to the races after a first-up win earlier this season.\n\nThe six-year-old had all but one of his starts on the all-weather track last season but was unable to breakthrough for a win until two weeks ago.\n\nEncore Boy\u2019s dominant two-and-a-half length win two weeks ago came against the likes of well-regarded all-weather runners such as Silver Fig, Star Luck and Just Not Listening.\n\nCoby Oppa is just one of an eight-strong team Lor will send to the races on Sunday with his Korea Cup runner Glorious Artist having his first start in Hong Kong this season.\n\nThe 94-rated five-year-old ran a strong fourth in the deep sand of Seoul\u2019s racecourse and shapes as a possible Dubai World Cup horse with Lor looking to travel more after the success in Korea.", "description": "The Sha Tin all-weather surface may often be shunned by punters and looked upon as biased, but trainer Frankie Lor Fu-chuen relishes the opportunity to race his horses on it....", "authors": ["Trenton Akers", "Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/24/12cbbc82-f5f2-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_143134.JPG?itok=-8CLs7so&v=1571898703", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
