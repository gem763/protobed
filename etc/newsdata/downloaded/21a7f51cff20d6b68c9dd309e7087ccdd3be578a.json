Pictured: protesters rallying against the law in Alabama in May when the Human Life Protection Act was passed in May (file)\n\nShould Alabama prevail, the now-stalled law would make it the first state in the US where abortion is illegal.\n\n'The court is persuaded that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the Act violates an individual\u2019s constitutional right to obtain a pre-viability abortion, and thus that it violates her constitutional rights,' said Judge Thompson in his order for a preliminary injunction against the legislation, according to AL.com.\n\nSigned into law on May 15, the Human Life Protection Act is the closest thing the US has seen to a total ban on abortions since the 1973 Roe v Wade Decision.\n\nAlabama's law would make it a felony, punishable by up to life in prison, for a doctor to perform an abortion at any stage of abortion unless the fetus was likely to be stillborn or die shortly after birth, or if pregnancy put the woman's life in grave danger.\n\nIt does not include exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nDespite widespread outcry, protests and a fierce debate, the bill passed the Alabama House and Senate handily and was signed into law by Governor Kay Ivey on May 15, the day after it was green-lighted by the Senate.\n\nAs its done against other laws narrowly restricting abortions - including so-called 'heartbeat bans' passed in Georgia, Texas, Missouri, Louisiana and other states - the ACLU wasted no time in filing suit against Alabama.\n\nTuesday's injunction will ensure that the suit can move forward and upward through the court system - including, quite possibly, the Supreme Court - before coming into effect.\n\nAlabama Attorney General Steve Marshall has long been prepared for that possibility.\n\nIn no uncertain terms, he responded in August to the ACLU and Planned Parenthood suit, announcing that he had every intention of challenging Roe v Wade.\n\nJudge Thompson's order suggests his skepticism that Marshall and Alabama will succeed - a sentiment shared and echoed by executive director of the ACLU of Alabama, Randal Marshall.\n\n'As expected, the court has blocked the law and it will not go into effect. Abortion remains legal in Alabama,' he told AL.com.\n\n'The state\u2019s repeated attempts to push abortion out of reach by enacting unconstitutional laws restricting abortions has already cost taxpayers nearly $2.5 million.'\n\n'This ill-advised law will cost taxpayers more money.'\n\nStaci Fox, president of Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates said the order is a 'victory for the entire nation.'\n\nIt comes as a Missouri hearing this week weighs the fate of the state's last abortion clinic.\n\nThe injunction does not represent a final ruling from Judge Thompson, and the case will continue in his courtroom.\n\nOnce it is decided, Alabama or the ALCU and Planned Parenthood will almost certainly appeal it to Eleventh Circuit appellate court.\n\nIf, once again, the parties are dissatisfied (as they're expected to be), they can then appeal to the Supreme Court via a petition for writ of certiorari.\n\nIf granted cert, the case would go before the nine Justices of the Supreme Court and could be the vehicle by which the highest court in the nation revisits Roe v Wade.", "description": "Federal Judge Myron Thompson on Tuesday ordered a preliminary injunction on Alabama's law to make it a felony for doctors to perform almost all abortions, anticipating the bill is 'unconstitutional.'", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/20333094-0-image-a-4_1572363981195.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
