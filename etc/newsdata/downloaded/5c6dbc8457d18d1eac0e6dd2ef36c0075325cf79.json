You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe first picture, taken the most recently, shows the toddler standing next to a tree almost double her height wearing a multi-coloured skirt and a T-shirt that reads: \u201cLegend.\u201d\n\nThe second image, which was taken a year ago, shows the youngster standing next to the tree wearing a pair of leopard print trousers, while the third shows Ohanian holding his baby daughter next to the plant, which has seemingly only just been planted.\n\n\u201cOur little mango is growing up so fast. Every year a photo,\u201d Ohanian wrote in the post\u2019s caption.\n\nThe entrepreneur added he was \u201cgrateful\u201d to have spent the first few months of his daughter\u2019s life with her while on paternity leave.\n\n\u201cOn my way to DC to make sure every American has the same opportunity for #paidfamilyleave,\u201d he concluded the caption.\n\nOn Tuesday 22 October, Ohanian will join non-profit organisation Paid Leave US (PL+US) and Dove Men+Care on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, as an advocate for paid family and medical leave.\n\nThe aim of PL+US is to achieve paid family leave in the US by 2022, it states on the organisation\u2019s website.\n\nIn August, Ohanian wrote an essay for The New York Times in which he outlined the importance of ensuring every father is able to take paternity leave.\n\nHe said he had \u201cnever thought much about paternity leave\u201d before Williams experienced \u201cnear-fatal complications\u201d during their daughter\u2019s birth, which included spending \u201cdays in recovery fighting for her life against pulmonary embolisms\u201d.\n\n\u201cNothing could have dragged me away from my wife and daughter in those hours, days and weeks \u2013 and I\u2019m grateful that I was never forced to choose between my family and my job,\u201d Ohanian stated.\n\n\u201cI get that not every father has the flexibility to take leave without the fear that doing so could negatively impact his career. But my message to these guys is simple: Taking leave pays off, and it\u2019s continued to pay dividends for me two years later.\u201d", "description": "Alexis Ohanian has shared a series of pictures of his and Serena Williams\u2018 daughter, comparing her growth to a tree over the past couple of years.
