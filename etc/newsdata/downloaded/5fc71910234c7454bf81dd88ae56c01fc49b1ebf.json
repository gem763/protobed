(His fund has also beaten the Dow Jones Industrial Index\u2019s DJIA, -1.28% 15% rise over the same period.)\n\nHe\u2019s trounced the 10-year bull market by a wide margin, earning investors a 600% return since March 2009. (The S&P 500 has returned 365%).\n\nFactSet reports he\u2019s beaten the index over 20 years. According to the fund\u2019s latest filings, Matthew 25 has beaten the S&P index by an average of 1.3% a year since it was launched, at the end of 1995. And that\u2019s net of expenses of 1.1% a year.\n\nHow did he do it? \u201cI believe you make money in the exceptional,\u201d says Mulholland.\n\nMatthew 25 isn\u2019t a Catholic, \u201creligious\u201d fund, he says. He doesn\u2019t screen investments based on dogma. \u201cScripture is very, very important, but I\u2019m a big fan of [St Thomas] Aquinas.\u201d Instead, he asks, \u201cAre they operating in an honorable way?\u201d\n\nHe was happy to hold Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, -0.63% for years, he says, even though Warren Buffett had planned to donate money to Planned Parenthood. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with that part of his long-term plans, but I consider him as one of the most stand-up and noble capitalists,\u201d he says.\n\nMulholland said he likes \u201cexceptional companies,\u201d and \u201cRip Van Winkle stocks\u201d that you can buy and hold, even if you slept for 20 years.\n\n\u201cFacebook FB, -1.27% is an exceptional company,\u201d he says of his current holdings. \u201cKKR KKR, -2.94% has exceptional people. Apple AAPL, +0.28%, I don\u2019t need to describe it. Goldman Sachs GS, -2.19% is one of the most successful and recognized financial brands in the world.\u201d\n\nHe has no magic formula, he says. He selects investments based on quantitative and qualitative measures. \u201cI run the fund as an owner-operator,\u201d he says. He and his wife jointly own 5.5% of the fund. \u201cThe problem is, when you have an employee mentality the job is more important to you than the portfolio. I\u2019m trying to be a master craftsman. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m there.\u201d\n\nOne of his biggest investment successes recently: Fannie Mae FNMA, -5.26% \u201cpreferred stocks\u201d (quasi-bonds). They\u2019ve boomed as the mortgage-financing giant has slowly recovered from its financial-crisis woes.\n\nMulholland has no M.B.A. majored in economics at Lafayette College in Easton, Penn., and follows \u201cthe Abraham Lincoln education\u2014read, and learn.\u201d His two favorite investment books are two classics: Ben Graham\u2019s \u201cThe Intelligent Investor,\u201d and Philip Fisher\u2019s \u201cCommon Stocks And Uncommon Profits.\u201d\n\n\u2018Every company, like every human being, has a mix of good and bad.\u2019\n\nHe\u2019s a member of Opus Dei, the conservative Catholic group, and when I first visited his offices he was just back from a retreat. There\u2019s a bobble-headed Pope Francis on his shelf\u2014a gift, he says, from his sister.\n\nSome may question the integrity or values of some of the companies in which he invests. He says he is more likely to pray for a someone than avoid their stock. \u201cI do believe that every company, like every human being, has a mix of good and bad,\u201d he says.\n\nYet Mulholland\u2019s faith drives him. As he first discovered from his encounter with the homeless man, he believes Matthew 25 has three messages and they are all connected.\n\nThe first lesson, from the Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins, is to be prepared \u201cfor you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.\u201d (The New King James Version.) The second, from the Parable of the Talents, he said is \u201cto fulfill our duties in this life to the best of our abilities.\u201d The third \u201cis to be good to people, and whenever we help those in need it is like helping Jesus Himself.\u201d\n\nCatholics, he says, often have a negative view of wealth. But wealth is fine, so long as you put it to good use. \u201cI sign my letters, \u2018Good fortune,\u2019 because if you are able to create a fortune then you should use it for good.\u201d\n\nMulholland is a capitalist. \u201cI\u2019m not a big believer in central planning,\u201d he says.\n\nBut capitalism, he believes, must be combined with ethics. \u201cThe golden rule is, do unto others as you would like done unto yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t care what religion you are. That rule appears in many other religions and cultures, and if that permeated the system that would make capitalism so much better.\u201d\n\n\u201cCapitalism is the best system,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut it\u2019s far from perfect.\u201d", "description": "Mark Mulholland tells MarketWatch he set up a mutual fund, Matthew 25, after a homeless man quoted a section of that gospel from the bible.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS215_arends_ZG_20190927103457.jpg"}
