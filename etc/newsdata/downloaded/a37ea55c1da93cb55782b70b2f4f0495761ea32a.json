Thanks to a skin transplant over the summer, he's now able to wear clothes for the first time (right)\n\nDoctors diagnosed the Ja'bari with aplasia cutis congenita, a condition in which there is the absence of skin at birth. Pictured: Ja'bari being held by this mother after his skin transplant\n\n'Now you can kiss him, touch him, do all that stuff,' Maldonado, Ja'bari's mother, told KTRK. 'He got to wear his first set of clothes now, so he's getting there.'\n\nShe says Ja'bari's transplant is the first of its kind that's ever been done for such a young child with his condition.\n\nMaldonado said she was so excited to hold her son and have skin-to-skin contact for the first time.\n\n'It was heartwarming, because he was crying when he was laying down,' she told KTRK.\n\n'But as soon as I picked him up and had the skin-to-skin contact and put him on my chest, he just stopped crying.'\n\nMaldonado wrote in a post on GoFundMe that she suffered no complications throughout her pregnancy until around the 37-week mark when doctors noticed he wasn't gaining weight.\n\nHer doctors at Methodist Children's Hospital decided to induce her but, on the morning of the procedure, Ja'bari's heart rate dropped so low that an emergency C-section was performed.\n\nIt was then that staff noticed something was very wrong. Ja'bari had skin on his head, neck and some on his legs - but none on his torso or arms.\n\nHe was diagnosed with aplasia cutis congenita, a condition in which there is absence of skin at birth.\n\nUsually the skin is missing in patches that that resemble lesions or open wounds, occur on the scalp, but can also be found on the torso and limbs.\n\nJa'bari was placed on life support and doctors told his parents there was nothing more they could do. Pictured: Ja'bari with his mother, Priscilla Mondalo, in April 2019\n\nJa'bari (pictured) was transferred in April to Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, where doctors believe he was misdiagnosed\n\nAplasia cutis congenita affects about one in 10,000 newborns. The cause is unknown, but scientists believe it is a genetic disease.\n\nAfter doctors told Ja'bari's parents that there was nothing more they could do, and they believe he would die, the couple petitioned a transfer to Texas Children's Hospital (TCH).\n\nAt first, Medicaid denied a transfer to TCH because it would be 'out of network', according to Fox San Antonio. But, one day later, the insurance company decided to approve it.\n\nFamily members told the news station that Medicaid was flooded with complaints after news broke about the denied transfer.\n\n'It's very amazing. It's just powerful how one word changed this whole scenario for the best for my son,' Maldonado, 25, told the San Antonio Express-News.\n\nAfter examining Ja'bari, staff at Texas Children's suspected that the doctors at Methodist Children's may have misdiagnosed the infant.\n\nThe new team believes the baby is suffering from epidermolyosis bullosa (EB), a rare genetic disorder that causes the skin to blister and burst, leaving raw sores that are susceptible to infections.\n\nSufferers of EB are missing type VII collagen - a protein that allows the top layer of skin to bind with the bottom layers.\n\nThe slightest movement causes the skin to constantly and consistently fall off.\n\nEB is rare, with just one in every 50,000 children in the US diagnosed with the condition, according to Stanford Children's Health.\n\nDoctors at Texas Children's believes he has epidermolyosis bullosa, a rare genetic disorder that causes the skin to blister and burst. Pictured: Ja'bari in March 2019\n\nSkin was grown for Ja'Bari in a laboratory in Boston and his brother and sister are now able to touch him for the first time (pictured)\n\nJa'bari's condition has improved following the skin transplant. He weighed just three pounds at birth and now weighs about 18 pounds.\n\nHe is also no longer taking pain medication and is able to breathe on his own, reported KTRK.\n\nHowever, his eyelids, right hand and right foot remain fused together and will need to be surgically separated.\n\nMaldonado said she still considers every day a blessing.\n\n'Making coo sounds that normal babies would do, he's interacting with us,' she told the station. 'Even though he can't see us and stuff, he's still interacting.'", "description": "Ja'bari Gray, 10 months, was born in January 2019 in San Antonio, Texas, with almost no skin below his neck.
