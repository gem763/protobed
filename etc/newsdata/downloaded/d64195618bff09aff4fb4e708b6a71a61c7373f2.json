(Dylan Buell/Getty Images)\n\nBut then: \u201cThere\u2019s some selfish people on that defense though. Absolutely. I think Rasul Douglas, who\u2019s a good friend of mine, I think he took some unwanted heat for some blown coverages on some other people\u2019s selfish play. And we don\u2019t even have to say names at all. They know who they are,\u201d Scandrick said. \u201cI think that when you wear a \u2018C\u2019 on your jersey [as a captain], it\u2019s your job to bring guys along, it\u2019s your job that sometimes you have to take [the heat], and you need to bring the thing together.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case. You look at everything that happened \u2014 you hold out for a contract, you\u2019re not making any plays, any splash plays, then you go down to Minnesota and you somehow supposed to be on a half of the field and you end up playing a crosser? That\u2019s not a rookie we\u2019re talking about here. It\u2019s a two-time Super Bowl champ.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nJenkins, speaking to media after Scandrick\u2019s appearance, said, \u201cI could give two [expletive] about people who aren\u2019t here,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cFor us to move on as a team, we can\u2019t have [expletive] like that in here.\u201d\n\nAnd a couple of hours later, the Eagles\u2019 social-media team showed that it has Jenkins\u2019 back.\n\nThat tweet contains video from the Eagles-Vikings game, a clip of Jenkins shedding a blocker and then wrapping his arms around ball carrier Alexander Mattison. Fellow safety Rodney McLeod comes in to help finish the play, the ball comes loose \u2014 it appears Jenkins helped that happen \u2014 and an Eagles teammate gets the loose ball.\n\nOn the sideline, Scandrick approaches Jenkins.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why you the captain of this defense, bro,\u201d Scandrick says, placing a hand on the back of Jenkins\u2019 helmet. \u201cThe way that you [expletive] conduct yourself. First snap to the last.\u201d\n\nThe forced fumble came with 2 minutes left in the game and Philadelphia down 38-20.\n\nGame, set, match, Eagles social-media team. We respect the petty.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "We respect the petty.", "authors": ["Shalise Manza Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kw2r4k0kMoB5AInGj9WXZg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/P8EmV.2xSp8L8TEDi9J3BA--~B/aD0yNDMyO3c9MzY0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/2df43480-f764-11e9-bb5e-be043770dc47", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
