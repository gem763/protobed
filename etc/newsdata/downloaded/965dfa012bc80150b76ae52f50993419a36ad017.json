All predicted the statutory reserve ratio (SRR) would also be kept at 5.00%.\n\nThe central bank has loosened policy in several steps to boost sluggish growth after tourism and investments plummeted in Sri Lanka following deadly Easter Day bomb attacks by Islamist militants\n\nThe central bank cut rates by 100 bps in two meetings since May, reduced the SRR by 250 bps, releasing around 150 billion rupees ($832 million) of liquidity to the financial market. It also imposed caps on rupee deposit interest rates that enabled banks to reduce the cost of mobilizing funds from the general public.\n\nAs a result, the commercial banks' average weighted prime lending rate (AWPR) has fallen 136 basis points as of Oct. 2.\n\nThe Monetary Board last month ordered banks to reduce interest rates on all rupee denominated loans by at least 200 basis points by Oct. 15, from levels in April.\n\n\"Since the central bank's objective of reducing market lending rates are expected to take effect with lending rate caps, another rate cut is unwarranted,\" said Danushka Samarasinghe, CEO at Softlogic Capital Markets.\n\nThe rate cuts have already put pressure on the rupee currency , which has fallen 2.2% amid foreign outflows from government securities.\n\nThe attacks on luxury hotels and churches on April 21 killed more than 250 people, and private sector credit growth remains sluggish.\n\nThe island nation's economic growth eased to a 17-year low of 3.2% in 2018 and the IMF expects the pace to slow to 2.7% this year. A Reuters poll has predicted 2019 growth will be the lowest in nearly two decades.,\n\nThe government's finances, meanwhile, remain under pressure with a heavy external debt repayment schedule between 2019 and 2022.", "description": "Sri Lanka central bank seen keeping rates on hold ahead of elections: Reuters poll", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF980CM_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
