According to the officer, the Marines will continue their firing drills in this way twice a year until they find an alternative.", "description": "Marines Unable to Conduct Firing Drills on Islands Near N.Korea", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/22/2019102200653_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
