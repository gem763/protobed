Photo: Michelle Groskopf\n\nSince February, the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration has given 130 individuals \u2014 randomly selected from neighborhoods with a median household income at or below Stockton\u2019s of $46,033 \u2014 monthly payments of $500, no strings attached. The disbursements are part of an 18-month pilot program studying the effects of a universal basic income (UBI). Since February, I have followed five of the recipients to watch how this unexpected windfall has changed their lives.\n\nMonth One \u201c I f e e l l i k e I h a d b e a t m y b o d y u p e n o u g h 2 0 - s o m e t h i n g y e a r s f o r t h o s e p e o p l e . \u201d\n\nWhen I arrive, Laura is smoking on the top of the stairs outside her apartment in a sprawling affordable-housing complex on the north side of Stockton. Her Pomeranian-Yorkie, Poopee, stands beside her. \u201cI guess they haven\u2019t got to the gate,\u201d she calls down after I get out of my car. The gate into the complex requires a code, but Laura told me on the phone that people keep busting through it, so I might be able to just drive in.\n\nLaura, who is 68, moved to Stockton from Oakland five years ago in search of more affordable rents. She\u2019d just been fired from her job at the Oracle Arena after working there for 21 years. She collects about $1,500 a month in Social Security and a small pension for her years as a union officer in the SEIU, which isn\u2019t enough to live on in the Bay Area.\n\nWe are sitting at a tall table in her immaculate living room. Large windows overlooking the parking lot are filled from floor to ceiling with plants. Sunlight filters through their leaves. There is a sign that reads THIS HOUSE IS GOVERNED BY A POMERANIAN. Outside is less peaceful.\n\nThe new management let everything go to hell, she says. They don\u2019t pick up the trash or maintain the buildings. People who don\u2019t live there gathered to party in the parking lot below her window.\n\n\u201cThey would turn their music up and smoke weed and drink at three, four, five, six in the morning,\u201d says Laura. She tried going outside to talk to them. \u201cThey would be nice while I was down there because I\u2019m not gonna accept you talking to me any kind of way.\u201d But as soon as she got back upstairs, it\u2019d be loud again.\n\nLaura would move out if she could. \u201cI put in a couple of applications at some other nice big affordable buildings, but most of the waiting lists here in Stockton are like three, four, five years,\u201d she says. And she can\u2019t afford market-rate rent. When she couldn\u2019t take it anymore, Laura called 911. A big showing of police swooped in and took the partyers away in handcuffs. Now they hang out in one of the other lots in the back. Laura laughs. \u201cThey said, \u2018There\u2019s a crazy old black lady over there, we will find somewhere else to go.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen Laura worked at the coliseum, she developed a reputation as someone who stood up for people. While the arena was under construction and everyone was out of work, Laura started telling her co-workers to apply for unemployment. \u201cMy boss called me on the carpet in the office and told me, \u2018We at the coliseum feel like we pay you guys enough so that if you\u2019re out, you\u2019ll be able to sustain yourself until you\u2019re back,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re crazy.\u2019 So after we had that conversation, I told more people because it really pissed me off.\u201d\n\nLaura worked in wardrobe, maintaining the uniforms for the ushers, ticket takers, security, maintenance. On big-game nights, as many as 600 employees would line up in front of the bay window where Laura and her colleagues would distribute the uniforms. She rolled heavy wardrobe racks, put on and took off hundreds of uniforms from their hangers, buttoning and zipping over and over, packed everything to send out for dry cleaning, washed, dried, and ironed the rest. Over time, Laura has had two carpal-tunnel surgeries and six operations for trigger finger.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s trigger finger?\u201d I ask.\n\nLaura holds up her hands like she\u2019s going to run her nails down a chalkboard. \u201cYour fingers curl forward like claws and you can\u2019t open them,\u201d she says. She and her co-workers were all categorized as part time so the coliseum could avoid having to provide benefits. Because she worked so many hours, it had to cover her medical insurance, but management didn\u2019t want to pay for her surgeries. They claimed that her work didn\u2019t involve repetitive motions. She fought the coliseum on it, and it paid. After she healed, Laura went back to work, sleeping on the desk on a pile of coats on the nights she worked a double.\n\nIn 2005, Laura was elected secretary-treasurer of her chapter, the Local 1877, which covered not only the workers at the coliseum but also janitors, airport workers, and security officers, around 30,000 members in Northern California at the time. During the 2008 presidential election, the SEIU endorsed Barack Obama, injecting a ton of cash into his race and committing an army of foot soldiers. Laura was sent on the road for four months, first to Texas and then to Columbus, Ohio.\n\nWhen she got to Ohio in September, Obama was trailing in the polls. She knocked on doors from 7 in the morning to 7 at night. Her feet swelled up so badly she couldn\u2019t fit them in her shoes, and she walked in her socks on the last day. But they turned Ohio blue, she tells me, her smoker\u2019s voice filled with pride. She got a plaque with Obama\u2019s face on it. \u201cIt looks like bronze,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not, it\u2019s something cheaper, but it\u2019s really, really nice.\u201d\n\nThe next presidential election, in 2012, Laura\u2019s local sent her to Las Vegas, canvassing for six months this time. (Thanks to her union contract, the coliseum had to let her go.) During the last week she was there, she slipped in the bathroom. She doesn\u2019t know if she blacked out or if she fell. \u201cBut I woke up and I was laying on the floor and I couldn\u2019t walk.\u201d\n\nShe returned to Oakland, where she had arthroscopic surgery on her knee, which helped a little, but what she really needed was her knee replaced. But that would put her out of work for much longer, and the coliseum denied her workmen\u2019s-compensation claim since her injury didn\u2019t happen on the job site. It hurt to walk, so she asked for a light-duty assignment. But management refused.\n\nThe union gave her office work for eight or nine months. \u201cThen they told me they couldn\u2019t afford it anymore.\u201d The coliseum said she could come back to the wardrobe department, she refused, and they fired her.\n\n\u201cI feel like I had beat my body up enough 20-something years for those people, and I refused to do it when I was already all busted up.\u201d Laura stops talking for a moment and struggles to hold my gaze. Her fist is balled tight on the table.\n\n\u201cAs long as you have a job, you have dignity,\u201d Laura says. \u201cAnd I felt like I lost mine when I lost my job.\u201d She also lost her ability to support herself. She\u2019d been making close to $20 an hour, so she had no trouble meeting her bills. Now, after she pays her rent, car note and insurance, and electric bill, she has barely anything left each month for gas, food, dog food, cigarettes, and any other expenses. She cut off her cable and internet and goes to the food bank. Her son, who lives with her, contributes what he can.\n\nShe\u2019s racked up nearly $2,000 in credit-card debt. She is hoping to use the SEED money to wipe it out and take care of the car repairs she\u2019d been putting off. There\u2019s one other thing she\u2019d like to do with her money, she tells me hesitantly. \u201cI have a brand-new great-granddaughter.\u201d And she\u2019d really like to rent a reliable car and have her son drive her down to Los Angeles to meet her.\n\nLaura helped raise some of her grandkids. She\u2019s always been the one to bring her family together. \u201cThanksgiving, Christmas, Fourth of July. I cook and they can come eat and hang out for a while.\u201d A tall baker\u2019s rack in her kitchen is filled with ten different cast-iron pans, lobster pots, a bread machine, an ice-cream maker, a pressure cooker, an electronic roasting pan. But the last time she had everyone over, she had to ask them to bring some of the food and kick in money. \u201cAnd that\u2019s kind of different for me,\u201d she says, her voice thick. She still gets all the grandkids birthday presents, but it\u2019s just a small gift card now and she no longer springs for fancy boxes to send them in. This isn\u2019t how she\u2019d pictured her retirement. \u201cI\u2019ve even had thoughts that I wish I didn\u2019t work like I was supposed to all these years and do the right thing. \u2019Cause for what?\u201d\n\nMonth Two \u201c A l l o f a s u d d e n e v e r y t h i n g w e n t b l a c k . \u201d\n\nI reach Laura on the phone a few days before she\u2019s due to receive her second installment. When I ask how it feels to have a little extra money in her pocket, she says: \u201cI think I haven\u2019t been seeing these wrinkles up here for a month really.\u201d Being able to take care of her car note, which she was behind on, and to have the money to replace her shocks and her battery, is a big relief. At the doctor\u2019s recently, where she had to perform a stress test, he noticed that her blood pressure was lower too.\n\nThe doctor has her wearing a heart monitor to try to get to the bottom of some dizzy spells she\u2019s having. The first time it happened, she was sitting on her patio talking to a friend. The next thing she knew she was lying facedown with a broken tooth. About six months ago, it happened when she was driving on the highway with her granddaughter. \u201cIt was raining cats and dogs and it was heck of traffic,\u201d Laura says. \u201cAll of a sudden everything went black.\u201d Laura managed to pull the car into the shrubs on the side of the road, where she waited until her vision came back. \u201cI never lost total consciousness, but it scared the mess out of me,\u201d she says.\n\nShe just celebrated her son\u2019s birthday. She made him a crab boil at his request and bought him some new jeans and a nice leather Levi Strauss jacket that was marked down from $150 to $30. \u201cHe\u2019s a grown-ass man,\u201d she says, \u201cbut he is still my kid, and I don\u2019t like him looking crazy when he has to go out and do things.\u201d It made her feel good to be able to afford to do this for him.\n\nWhen I ask what she thinks she\u2019ll do with her next installment, she says, \u201cDefinitely pay bills. There\u2019s always some bill demanding to be paid. But I want to get in the mode of getting ready to try and go see my great-granddaughter.\u201d She\u2019s been getting on her son to figure out when he can drive her down there.\n\nMonth Four \u201c I \u2019 m n o t d e p e n d e n t o n a n y o n e . I \u2019 v e n e v e r b e e n , a n d I d o n \u2019 t w a n t t o b e . \u201d\n\nThe next time I\u2019m in town, I accompany Laura to a doctor\u2019s appointment for her hip. Her knee keeps giving out when she sits down, so she slams down on her hip, and now she can barely walk. Five years later, she\u2019s still waiting on that knee replacement. When we pass over a speed bump on our way out of the complex, I see her wince.\n\nThere are no open handicapped-parking spots near the entrance of the health center, and we have to walk a long distance. Laura is using a cane she inherited from a neighbor. As we make our way, she tells me how tired she\u2019s been since her son started working the overnight shift at a gas station down the street. She can\u2019t sleep from worry. There was a recent shooting on her street. And a guy was murdered in a laundromat in a nearby shopping center. Then two more people were killed during a vigil for the victim.\n\nWe finally reach the entrance to the health center. The neighborhood is rough, Laura tells me. \u201cNot that I haven\u2019t ever dealt with the rough, but not on this scale.\u201d\n\nWhen we meet up after the appointment, Laura is feeling a bit better. Her doctor has given her a shot for her hip and told her that her heart appears very healthy. The bad news is that they still don\u2019t know why she blacked out. If it happens again, he wants her to go back to the neurologist, which means she could lose her license. \u201cI\u2019m not dependent on anyone. I\u2019ve never been, and I don\u2019t want to be,\u201d she says when I ask if she has anyone to give her rides.\n\nThinking about her future can get overwhelming fast. But she picked up an application at a new clothing store across the street. If she can get to the point where she\u2019s able to stand for longer periods of time, she is thinking of trying to pick up some hours there so at least she\u2019ll have some extra money.\n\nIn the meantime, the SEED money is helping. Once she got her car fixed, she was able to resume visiting her older son, who is in prison near Sacramento, which she thinks helps him to serve better time. She\u2019s been paying more than the minimum balance on her credit cards. She hops she can wipe them out by the time the program is over. She\u2019s thinking about doubling up on her car payments, too. \u201cThat way, I\u2019ll be okay with maybe being able to find a place a little bit more expensive on the rent.\u201d\n\nMonth Seven \u201c W h e n I d o n \u2019 t h a v e t h e S E E D m o n e y a n y m o r e , i t \u2019 s g o n n a b e r e a l h e c t i c . \u201d\n\nThe next time I meet Laura, she\u2019s not using the cane anymore, but another health issue recently landed her in the emergency room. She had a tingling feeling down her right arm, and she couldn\u2019t lift it above her waist. \u201cIt felt like a stroke. It was kind of scary, so I called the ambulance.\u201d Her doctor diagnosed her with rheumatoid arthritis. The trip cost $3,000. She\u2019s not sure yet how much she\u2019ll have to pay. \u201cSo my SEED program is gonna help me on that,\u201d she says.\n\nHer rent went up almost a hundred dollars, which means she has only $250 left after her car and utilities are paid. She says that she needs to start looking for another place. \u201cBut talking to people that are moving \u2014 it\u2019s rough out there.\u201d It\u2019s getting rougher here, too. A young man who lived in the complex across the street was murdered. Then a few weeks ago, some kids threw a boulder through the sliding glass door of her downstairs neighbors\u2019 apartment and took everything of value. \u201cSo I\u2019m up all night. Every time Poopee would bark, I\u2019m running to look to see if somebody is going back into their place.\u201d\n\nThese vandals broke into three more apartments in the complex and busted the windows of six or seven cars. It doesn\u2019t do any good to complain to the security guard. \u201cThe guy got pissed off because I was hollering at him. I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, can you hear me now? We tell you all the time about this stuff.\u2019 \u201d But she has to be careful or she could get evicted, and then where would she go?\n\n\u201cWhen I don\u2019t have the SEED money anymore, it\u2019s gonna be real hectic,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really looking at is trying to get my health together and then go find me a little piece of job somewhere.\u201d Her biggest concern now is ending up homeless, which is why she decided to focus on getting her car in good working order. \u201cI know a lot of shelters don\u2019t let them bring their dogs. But I\u2019m not going to stay in a shelter if my dog can\u2019t stay there. So I\u2019ll be sleeping outside in my car.\u201d\n\nThe one bright spot is that she got to see her new great-granddaughter. Her grandson, whom she helped raise, has a good job now at a local warehouse. He rented an SUV and drove her down to L.A., where he got them an Airbnb for a few nights. \u201cI had to listen to that rap all the way to L.A.,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cBut it was really nice. I thoroughly enjoyed it.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t let her contribute other than a little gas money and a meal or two. \u201cI did this for you,\u201d he told her. \u201cAll the things that you\u2019ve done for me in my life, I feel like I needed to do something for you.\u201d\n\nThis project was supported by a grant from the investigative news site Capital & Main.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the October 14, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
