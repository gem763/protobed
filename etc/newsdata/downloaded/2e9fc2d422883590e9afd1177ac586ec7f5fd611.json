Do Y\u2019all Even Know Watchmen ?", "language": "en", "text": "Oh, dear, people are unhappy about their comics being too left-leaning again.\n\nThe CW\u2019s Batwoman was initially getting review bombed by a bunch of people (because \u2026 women and gays? Not in my Gotham!) and now that trend has continued with HBO\u2019s Watchmen series, which premiered this weekend. According to CBR, the show has a 93% Fresh rating from critics but is scored at 49% by audiences. Of course, there are those with legitimate criticism of the series\u2014as I have my own\u2014but many other complaints are about the show\u2019s perceived \u201cpolitically correct\u201d narrative and it being \u201ctoo woke,\u201d upset that this new series has a very political stance.\n\nExcept that, you know, the original comic by Alan Moore is super political, left-leaning, and was created to mock a lot of things. But you know, people don\u2019t actually like to think about it, especially when it comes to one character in particular: Rorschach, Ted Cruz\u2019s favorite.\n\nIn the show, there is a white supremacist group called the \u201cSeventh Cavalry\u201d in Tulsa that has taken to Rorschach\u2019s black-and-white mask, and they are acting up in response to President Robert Redford\u2019s push to implement reparations to those affected by past racial injustices. That absolutely makes sense, since Rorschach, in the comics, is outwardly (checks the list) racist, homophobic, sexist, and a total and complete fascist. Alan Moore literally wrote him to make fun of The Question, Mr. A, and a bunch of other Steve Ditko comic characters that the artist/writer used to promote his Ayn Randian ideals.\n\nWatchmen has always been about taking the idea of superheroes to its natural conclusion with the events in world history. That\u2019s why, at least from my perspective, the issue of reparations makes sense in this context. For the first time in a long time, that is a serious topic of debate, and with the presidency something you can do for unlimited terms in the world of Watchmen, a president, especially a popular one, could tackle that kind of legislation. In a place like Tulsa, which has always had a racial divide and dark history of white inhabitants being antagonistic when their Black counterparts make it, this just seems like the natural conclusion\u2014especially when Rorschach\u2019s journals were shared with the equivalent of Breitbart News.\n\nThese white supremacists are the logical conclusion to his rhetoric.\n\nDoes that mean you\u2019re a white supremacist if that was your favorite character in the comics? No \u2026 unless you actually are a white supremacist. Rorschach is an interesting character because Alan Moore is a good writer and knows how to teach without preaching. His work is layered and thoughtful but also filled with clear intent. From what I have watched of the show, while it isn\u2019t perfect, I\u2019m willing to give Damon Lindelof room to tell the story as long as he does the same. Well, as much room as you can give a former Lost showrunner, but that\u2019s a whole different kettle of alien squid.\n\nStill, more than anything, I wish that audience reviews stopped being a way for people to drag something for being \u201ctoo woke,\u201d because it creates bad faith for everyone. We are allowed to have different tastes and have our political leaning affect out taste, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t be fair.\n\n(via CBR, image: HBO)\n\nWant more stories like this?
