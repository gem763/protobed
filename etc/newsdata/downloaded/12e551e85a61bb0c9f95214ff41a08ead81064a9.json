(Seth Wenig/AP)\n\nA New York City Council member on Thursday proposed repealing the city\u2019s ban on conversion therapy to thwart a potential Supreme Court battle that could set precedent that would complicate efforts to outlaw the discredited practice.\n\nCouncil Speaker Corey Johnson\u2019s bill comes in response to a legal challenge from the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian organization that alleges the ban infringes upon freedom of speech and religion. The federal lawsuit, filed in January, targets the city\u2019s ordinance prohibiting people from charging others for conversion therapy, which includes any technique meant to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe decision to suggest eradicating the ban was \u201cpainful,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. The council and Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), a 2020 presidential hopeful, are expected to support the repeal, which would take effect by October.\n\n\u201cAfter intense deliberation, the Council concluded that it was best to take this drastic step,\u201d said Johnson, who is gay. \u201cThe courts have changed considerably over the last few years, and we cannot count on them to rule in favor of much-needed protections for the LGBTQ community.\u201d\n\nThe move to repeal the ban is the first time Born Perfect, a legal campaign that works to end conversion therapy, has advocated undoing a prohibition to protect its strategy of pushing for local and state restrictions. Eighteen states, the District of Columbia and about 55 municipalities ban conversion therapy for juveniles.\n\n[Conversion therapy center founder who sought to turn LGBTQ Christians straight says he\u2019s gay, rejects \u2018cycle of self shame\u2019]\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom has a history of elevating cases to the Supreme Court, where a conservative-leaning majority currently sits. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, which includes New York, also has become more conservative since President Trump appointed three judges to it. Two other of his nominees for the 2nd Circuit are pending.\n\nRoger Brooks, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, called New York City\u2019s plan to repeal the conversion therapy ban a \u201cwin\u201d for the Orthodox Jewish psychotherapist behind the lawsuit, his clients and all New Yorkers.\n\n\u201cBy trying to regulate and censor private sessions between an adult and his counselor, New York City directly violated freedom of speech \u2014 a core right protected by the First Amendment,\u201d Brooks said in a statement. \u201cThe city council appears to have realized its error and correctly concluded that this censorship is unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nThe ordinance, which imposes a $1,000 fine for a first offense, was susceptible to legal challenges because it is broader than other similar legislation. Most conversion therapy laws, including a New York state law that took effect in January, ban the practice just for juveniles.\n\nJohnson told The Washington Post that he initially turned down LGBTQ rights organizations\u2019 efforts to persuade him to reverse the ban because he wanted to resist giving in to right-wing groups. Eventually, he said, he listened to the advocates who urged him to propose the repeal for the sake of protecting other laws.\n\n\u201cIt was a process for me,\u201d Johnson told The Post. \u201cAnd ultimately, when the case was made to me that this law could potentially be jeopardizing protecting millions of other children across the country, that was the thing that moved me.\u201d\n\nAdvocates believe LGBTQ New Yorkers\u2019 rights will remain unchanged after the repeal because the city ordinance duplicates the state\u2019s consumer-protection laws, said Mathew Shurka, a co-founder and strategist at Born Perfect. The organization previously achieved a victory in New Jersey and a settlement in California for people who used state consumer-fraud laws to sue over their experiences with conversion therapy.\n\n[Do LGBTQ athletes owe the public a revelation about their sexuality? Straight athletes don\u2019t.]\n\nFour lawsuits across the country currently challenge conversion therapy bans, Shurka said, and advocates want to minimize legal challenges. The consumer-protection angle of New York City\u2019s existing ordinance is, legally, \u201ca little bit of gray,\u201d he said, making it good ground to cede.\n\n\u201cInstead of investing in winning the lawsuit or fighting for the lawsuit, why don\u2019t we just repeal the law because it\u2019s an unnecessary law?\u201d Shurka said.\n\nNearly 700,000 adults in the United States have undergone conversion therapy, according to the Williams Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Law. Tactics include talk therapy, \u201caversion treatments\u201d such as electric shocks and non-aversive treatments such as trying to change thought patterns through hypnosis.\n\nConversion therapy is ineffective and associated with poor mental health, including suicidal ideation, according to many experts, and several major medical associations \u2014 including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics \u2014 oppose the practice. People who report wanting to change their sexual orientations perceive a benefit from therapeutic interventions when they are given acceptance, social support and opportunities to explore their identity, according to the American Psychological Association.\n\nThe conversion therapy industry was shaken several weeks ago when the founder of faith-based conversion therapy center Hope for Wholeness Network said he was gay and recognized the harm he had caused.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all in my past, but many, way TOO MANY continue believing that there is something wrong with themselves and wrong with people that choose to live their lives honestly and open as gay, lesbian, trans, etc.,\u201d McKrae Game, 51, wrote on Facebook. \u201cThe very harmful cycle of self shame and condemnation has to stop.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nPerspective: The ex-gay Christianity movement is making a quiet comeback.
