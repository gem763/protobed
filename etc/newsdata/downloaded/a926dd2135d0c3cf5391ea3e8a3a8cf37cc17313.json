He was 71.\n\nHis death was confirmed by the Mexican artists\u2019 association ANDI. Mr. Jos\u00e9 announced in 2017 that he had pancreatic cancer.\n\nMr. Jos\u00e9, whose real name is Jos\u00e9 R\u00f3mulo Sosa Ortiz, climbed to the top of the Latin charts in the 1970s with slow songs such as \u201cEl Triste,\u201d or \u201cThe Sad Man,\u201d and \u201cAmar y Querer,\u201d or \u201cLove and want.\u201d The power of his voice and his ability to sing technically difficult tunes in a wide register made him a treasured cultural icon in Latin America.\n\nMr. Jos\u00e9\u2019s music also became popular in countries including Japan and Russia.\n\nThe artist\u2019s voice, a combination of baritone and lyric tenor, captivated audiences while his dressing style of suits accented with bow ties, pocket handkerchiefs and silk scarves was copied at nightclubs across Latin America.\n\n\u201cHe wrung out our hearts with his unmistakable voice and left an indelible mark on music for all time,\u201d Latin music star Gloria Estefan said on Instagram.\n\n\n\nMr. Jos\u00e9 performing in 2011 at the Latin Billboard Awards in Coral Gables, Fla. (Carlo Allegri/AP)\n\nMr. Jos\u00e9 was born to a family of musicians in Mexico City on Feb. 17, 1948. His mother, Margarita Ortiz Pensado, was a concert pianist, and his father was a tenor in the National Opera of Mexico.\n\nThe singer added a second Jos\u00e9 to his stage name in honor of his father, who died when Mr. Jos\u00e9 was 17. The father had abandoned the family when Mr. Jos\u00e9 was young. \u201cSince I inherited his voice,\u201d Mr. Jos\u00e9 told the Associated Press in 2005, \u201cthis is recognition of that inheritance.\u201d\n\nMr. Jos\u00e9 began his music career singing in cafes before founding a rock group called the Heart Breakers that launched an unsuccessful album in the mid-1960s. His solo career took off with a single called \u201cLa Nave del Olvido,\u201d or \u201cThe Ship of the Forgotten,\u201d and peaked in the 1980s with albums such as \u201cSecrets,\u201d his best-selling collaboration with Spanish love song composer and producer Manuel Alejandro.\n\nHe struggled with Lyme disease, facial paralysis, substance abuse and depression. His problems with alcohol and drugs led to the 1993 dissolution of his 18-year marriage with model Anel Nore\u00f1a, with whom he had two children, Jos\u00e9 Joel and Marisol.\n\nFollowing the separation, Mr. Jos\u00e9 began sleeping in a taxi on the outskirts of the Mexican capital. Friends intervened and took him to an addiction treatment center in the United States.\n\nThe artist married again in 1995, to Sarita Salazar, a Cuban-American he met while in rehab. They had a daughter, Sara. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.\n\nMr. Jos\u00e9 was nominated on multiple occasions for a Grammy, but he never obtained the prize. The Latin Recording Academy recognized the singer with a Musical Excellence Prize at the 2004 Latin Grammy awards. That same year, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nHis vocal troubles made it very difficult for him to sing in his later years. For a 2008 concert with Greek composer and pianist Yanni, it took the by-then scratchy-voiced Mexican singer seven days to prepare \u201cjust to attempt to sing,\u201d Yanni recalled in a video posted to Twitter. \u201cThat was an act of bravery on his part,\u201d he added.\n\nThe death of Mr. Jos\u00e9 hit hard in Mexico, where President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador called him \u201can extraordinary singer from an era that, with his songs and his romanticism, made a lot of people from my generation cry and be happy.\u201d", "description": "He climbed the Latin charts in the 1970s with songs included \u201cEl Triste\u201d and \u201cAmar y Querer.\u201d", "authors": ["Berenice Bautista", "Amy Guthrie", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fM5CpJ_nc0cHHr-csIDNpWYSSek=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RTOVDRHCZII6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
