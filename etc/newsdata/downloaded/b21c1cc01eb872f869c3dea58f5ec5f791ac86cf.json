(Photo: Extinction Rebellion)\n\nLondon has banned Extinction Rebellion protests, but that hasn\u2019t deterred the climate activists from continuing to their actions around the city. On Thursday, they shut down parts of the London Tube, climbing on train roofs and in some cases gluing themselves in place.\n\nIn response, commuters at the backed-up stations yelled, threw things, and pulled protesters not glued in place off the roofs of trains. At least eight people are in the custody of British Transit Police. And honestly, they deserved it.\n\nExtinction Rebellion has done a lot to raise the profile of climate activism in the past year owing largely to its bold, controversial actions. And most of its arrows are aimed at the right targets: the large banks that fund fossil fuel companies and world governments that have done next to nothing to rein in carbon pollution (and in many cases sped it along).\n\nBut the group has also been criticised for having a huge blindspot when it comes to class and race, and Thursday\u2019s actions shown a blistering, bright light on it.\n\nThere are a number of issues with Extinction Rebellion\u2019s transit shutdown. The first is that it almost certainly forced some commuters to walk out of the station and snag a taxi, Lyft, or Uber to their office. You know what emits more carbon than public transit and leads to congestion? Taxis, Lyfts and Ubers. So the whole point of shutting down public transit as a climate protest is somewhat self-defeating.\n\nThen there are the real issues of race and class. Everyone can relate to the annoyance of a delayed commute, but the people who suffer the worst consequences are society\u2019s most vulnerable. In the U.S. at least, more immigrants, people of colour, and low-income individuals rely on public transit, according to a survey by Pew Research Centre. For those groups as well as students, public transit is a cheap, reliable way to get to work and school on time.\n\nExtinction Rebellion begin their planned disruption of the tube on the Jubilee Line at Canning Town ???????? pic.twitter.com/oN8LDO1G0o \u2014 Holly Collins (@HollyJoCollins) October 17, 2019\n\nIn the case of people doing shift work paid by the hour, showing up late could be grounds for being fired at worst and a hit to their earnings at least. Yet snagging a ride share or taxi due to the Extinction Rebellion protest is, for many, either something that\u2019s unaffordable or an unnecessary burden that will require them to save money elsewhere.\n\nYoung adults and low-income people are also the ones who are suffering the most from the crushing weight of the climate crisis, rising inequality, and dirty air pollution (from too many cars on the roads among other things no less!). Fucking up their commute isn\u2019t just kicking them while they\u2019re down, it\u2019s holding them down as all those things bear down on them.\n\nAngry commuters clashed with climate protesters at peak rush hour in London this morning.

Filmmaker Astra Taylor pointed to the 2012 Occupy Wall Street actions where members chained open subway entrances with signs excoriating New York\u2019s MTA, allowing people to ride for free in a show of class solidarity.\n\nNo property was damaged, no commutes were disrupted, and people got a message that the group sympathised with those who use the city\u2019s worsening public transit system. It\u2019s easy to imagine Extinction Rebellion doing something similarly subversive given the role public transit could play in addressing the climate crisis (after all, transportation is the largest chunk of the UK\u2019s emissions).\n\nThe way today\u2019s events have unfolded are in sharp contrast to the climate strike movement, which has taken strides to be inclusive and showcase leaders from different walks of life, races and countries.\n\nIn its demands, Extinction Rebellion calls for a Citizens\u2019 Assembly on Climate and Ecological Justice made up of everyday people to guide lawmakers in setting sound climate policy. The group says that assembly would be tasked with considering \u201chow to mitigate the impacts of changes on the most vulnerable people.\u201d\n\nIt may want to look in the mirror first.", "description": "London has banned Extinction Rebellion protests, but that hasn\u2019t deterred the climate activists from continuing to their actions around the city.
