In the epic tale of foreign influence in the 2016 presidential election, the narrative about Russia helping Donald Trump was exhaustively probed and ultimately debunked. As Americans gape at Democrats\u2019 current efforts to impugn and impeach President Trump, they should be mindful that the gathering political storm represents the party\u2019s desperate efforts to suppress the other side of the story \u2014 that it was Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, together with Obama administration officials, who conspired with foreign governments to steal the election.\n\nFor Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, President Trump\u2019s requests to foreign officials for assistance rooting out 2016 election shenanigans amount to shocking acts of disloyalty to the Republic. \u201cWe could not ignore what the president did. He gave us no choice,\u201d she told CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday. She referred to news of a White House whistleblower citing second-hand rumors of a leaked July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Mr. Trump asked for his help on two fronts.\n\nFirst, he requested assistance with information in Ukraine\u2019s files on Crowdstrike, the security firm that purportedly fingered Russia for hacking servers belonging to the Democratic National Committee, thus triggering the futile investigation into collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. The second was help with details about Joe Biden\u2019s intervention in a Ukrainian probe of corruption that effectively shielded his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nTo be sure, the Biden matter clearly would have been better left to Justice Department officials. Given the former vice president\u2019s status as a Democratic presidential contender, it\u2019s easy to fathom the party\u2019s hypersensitivity to another in a long list of \u201cUncle Joe\u201d gaffes. Still, just as Mr. Biden has been dinged with nothing more than the appearance of impropriety for protecting his son, Mr. Trump \u2018s request crossed no boundary more ungentlemanly than one distinguishing Queensberry Rules from bare-knuckle politics.\n\nIn contrast, Democrats have unfairly seized upon Mr. Trump\u2019s request from Ukraine for information that could help unearth how the Trump-Russia investigation was triggered. That is exactly the purpose of the probe that U.S. Attorney General William Barr ordered U.S. Attorney John Durham to undertake following the exposure of apparent political bias against Mr. Trump before and after his election in 2016.\n\nUndeterred in its anti-Trump offensive, The New York Times lobbed a \u201cbombshell\u201d Monday contending the president \u201cpressed\u201d Australia\u2019s prime minister for information disproving supposed wrongdoing that fed special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. The intimation: Not done with collusion, the Donald is at it again.\n\nExcept that it was nothing of the sort. Mr. Trump told reporters on May 24 he wanted Mr. Barr to query other nations about the roots of the Mueller probe. Australian Ambassador Joe Hockey volunteered his nation\u2019s help in a May 28 letter to Mr. Barr obtained by Fox News saying, \u201cThe Australian Government will use its best endeavors to support your efforts in this matter.\u201d Great Britain and Italy reportedly have also been contacted for relevant information. Not exactly the image painted by Democrats of a Mafia boss demanding favors.\n\nGiven the party\u2019s carved-in-stone vow to rid the nation of Mr. Trump, the shouts for the president\u2019s removal from office are only growing louder. Mrs. Pelosi has tasked her lieutenants with engineering a rapid series of hearings that are meant to produce articles of impeachment this fall. It leaves time enough to ram them through the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives, and still have plenty of time to lay waste to the Republican-controlled Senate during a constitutionally required impeachment trial.\n\nFor their part, at least a few Republican senators are reinforcing the president\u2019s legitimate tactics for uncovering the source of the Trump-Russia collusion allegations: \u201cUkrainian efforts abetted by a U.S. political party to interfere in the 2016 election should not be ignored,\u201d wrote Sens. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin in a Monday letter to Mr. Barr. \u201cSuch allegations of corruption deserve due scrutiny, and the American people have a right to know when foreign forces attempted to undermine our Democratic processes.\u201d\n\nWhat Mr. Barr, Mr. Durham and their team of investigators uncover is the other side of the foreign collusion story that Americans deserve to hear. If Democrats proceed in their attempt to impeach and remove the president from office without it, their choice of rule by pitchfork and torch will long be remembered.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
