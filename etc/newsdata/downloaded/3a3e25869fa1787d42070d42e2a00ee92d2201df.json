I hope BA and its owner IAG show as much responsibility as the pilots.\u201d\n\nBritish Airways has offered pilots a pay increase of 11.5 per cent over three years, a deal that Balpa has consistently rejected. \u201cBritish Airways needs to wake up and realise its pilots are determined to be heard,\u201d Strutton has previously stated.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve previously taken big pay cuts to help the company through hard times. Now BA is making billions of pounds of profit, its pilots have made a fair, reasonable and affordable claim for pay and benefits.\u201d\n\nDespite the strike being called off, the UK flag carrier will have already refunded or rebooked thousands of passengers whose flights were due to be affected by the planned industrial action.\n\nA British Airways spokesperson said: \u201cWe have just received this news. We are considering the implications and we will give updates in due course.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Balpa pilots that work for Ryanair have walked out today in the first of seven days of strike action this month.
