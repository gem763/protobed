All of this makes it difficult to detect abnormal activity.\n\n\"It's like wading through a crowd of a million people and trying to pick out the one person wearing a green undershirt without being able to look under people's jackets. There's nothing suspicious about its existence, its appearance or even its initial behaviour. Everything about it seems normal.\" said Krishnan Subramanian, security researcher at Menlo Labs.\n\nHowever, Adwind does let the mask slip in one way: when it sends stolen credentials to a remote server, it uses commands that are not associated with Java \u2013 although by the time the malware is sending information back to the attackers, the damage has already been done.\n\nSEE: Ransomware: Prepare for hackers launching even more destructive malware attacks\n\nThat means organisations need to have a hand on what's happening on the network so attacks can be stopped before they do damage \u2013 and to be mindful of unexpected files in the system.\n\n\"From a detection standpoint, good visibility on web and email traffic is a must. These jRAT filenames seem to have a pattern by using common financial terms like \"Remittance\", \"Payment\", \"Advice,\". It's always a good idea to check the filename of a Java Application before invoking it,\" said Subramanian.\n\nMORE ON CYBERCRIME", "description": "Adwind Remote Access Trojan has been stealing credentials and other data since 2013 - and its authors have once again added a new string to its bow.", "authors": ["Danny Palmer"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/29/840e0fb5-493c-4900-ab7d-3b1559bfc97e/thumbnail/770x578/a16dff7cdc191a005bf7a4d42490e019/istock-1144604134.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
