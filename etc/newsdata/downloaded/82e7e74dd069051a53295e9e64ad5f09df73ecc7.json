In their verdict, they added that the medical care Magnitsky received \"had been inadequate and had led to his death.\"\n\nBesides insufficient medical care and ill treatment, the court said that the length of his detention \u2014 which lasted just under a year from his arrest to his death \u2014 was unjustified, that he was held in severely overcrowded conditions, and that Russian authorities failed to carry out an \"effective investigation\" into allegations of mistreatment and and medical negligence.\n\nThe court also ruled that the posthumous trial, which resulted in Magnitsky's conviction over tax evasion in 2013, breached the European Convention on Human Rights due to its \"inherent unfairness.\" The judges rejected a complaint that Magnitsky's arrest and detention had been \"ill-founded,\" however, arguing that there had been enough evidence to suspect him of tax evasion.\n\nMagnitsky's death in 2009 sparked an outcry. The U.S. in 2012 implemented the Magnitsky Act, a law enabling Washington to freeze assets and block visas of Russian officials thought to be involved in human rights violations.\n\nThe Magnitsky Act was spearheaded by Bill Browder, the manager of an investment fund that Magnitsky advised. Browder on Tuesday called the Strasbourg court's ruling a \"resounding victory.\"\n\nRussia's Interfax news agency reported that the country's justice ministry would consider whether to appeal within the next three months.", "description": "Judges in Strasbourg say the auditor, who died in jail in 2009, had been ill-treated in prison.", "authors": ["Zia Weise"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1094908066-1200x628.jpg"}
