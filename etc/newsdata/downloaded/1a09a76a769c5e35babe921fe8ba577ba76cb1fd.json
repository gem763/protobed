And he should know. He spends the majority of his time watching markets, and only sleeps four hours a night. He even goes as far as to call the latter allotment as a \"waste of time.\"\n\n\"There are two influences that I think are the biggest ones \u2014 and I think that if you just got these two right, it's the key to investing going forward,\" he said on The Bid, a market events and investing ideas podcast by BlackRock. \"It's demographics and technology.\"\n\nLet's get things started with demographics.\n\nRieder thinks that slowing birth rates and an aging boomer cohort will weigh on global growth for a long time. It's a conversation that keeps inching it's way into the limelight, as the baby boomer's gear up for an ill-prepared retirement.\n\n\"It has huge ramifications,\" he said. \"Global growth is going to stay low for a long time. These interest rates are going to stay low for a really long time.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Central banks have to keep rates low, because you don't create enough organic growth.\"\n\nRead more: Why BlackRock's $1.7 trillion bond chief gets up at 3:30 a.m.\n\nIn addition to slowing growth, Rieder references the soon-to-be insatiable appetite for steady, reliable income \u2014 and leans on the needs of pension funds and insurance companies to bolster his view.\n\nIn order to meet demand and cover liabilities, these institutions have to have access to massive amounts of income-generating assets. More demand equates to higher prices \u2014 and investors are already paying sky-high prices for assets that are yielding peanuts or nothing at all.\n\nRieder refers to this notion as \"a really, really big deal.\"\n\nNext up is technology.\n\nIt's no secret that technology is upending the world we live in. Entire industries \u2014 retail and energy to name a few \u2014 have been surmounted by technological disruptions. And the trend shows no sign of stopping.\n\n\"Make sure that you're in the right industries, make sure you're in the right places \u2014 but make sure that you're in those places that are not going to get disrupted, because technology is changing so darn fast,\" he said. \"Technology does not grow in a 45 degree angle, like a smooth graph.\"\n\nHe continued: \"It stays low and then it explodes higher.\"\n\nWhere he sees opportunity today\n\nTo that end, Rieder has identified two places where he sees budding prospects that are ripe for the picking: Gold and real estate.\n\n\"For the first time in a long time in many years, I'm actually excited about gold again,\" he said. \"When you depreciate the currency in other parts of the world \u2014 because you just print money, or negative interest rates \u2014 gold tends to work really well.\"\n\nAnd gold prices have been on a tear as of late as investors flood into the precious metal amidst heightened uncertainty and a plethora of stimulative central bank policies. In fact, since the start of 2019, SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) is up over 21%.\n\nHe sees similar allure in the real estate market.\n\n\"I think they're parts of the real estate market that I still think I really attractive,\" he said. \"I think the residential real estate market \u2014 whether it's a direct investment, whether it's tangential in a home builders \u2014 the equity in peoples' homes is the highest it's been in years and years and years.\"\n\nAn investor looking to adopt a similar approach could purchase a broad basket of home builders like the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB), or SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB).", "description": "Rick Rieder, CIO of global fixed income and head of global allocation at BlackRock, is excited about two asset classes in particular.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4ce5ecc4a0a2aa56b1ce5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
