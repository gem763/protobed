No one has ever fought harder for you or more valiantly for you from the Oval Office than this president. We need to support him right now more than ever in the face of radical leftist Democrats and socialists and their allies in the media and in the permanent bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nMiller said the reason why the deep state and Democrats are coming after Trump is because their livelihoods as part of the permanent swamp in D.C. are at risk because Trump is changing the order of things in Washington.\n\n\u201cHe keeps his solemn promises to the American people,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThese saboteurs within and without the government, as I said earlier, are like parasites feeding off the nation, feeding off its wealth, feeding off its vitality, feeding off its freedom for their own personal enrichment at all of our expense.\u201d\n\nMiller warned Americans, too, that now is the time to fight back.\n\n\u201cSo do not be a bystander to history,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThis is happening now. The chance for extraordinary victory is here and now, but we have to win this battle, and we have to be successful in implementing these policies and beating back the Adam Schiffs of the world and the deep state and the fake news media and the corrupt news media.\u201d\n\nHe also gave Americans advice about how to fight back, including making their support of Trump clear to their elected representatives and senators and posting Breitbart News articles on social media. If the public rallies to Trump\u2019s side, Miller said, the American people can yet again defeat the globalist forces who want to perpetrate more destructive policies upon them\u2014and the \u201cfate\u201d of the country itself lies in the hands of the people.\n\n\u201cEveryone has it in their power to make a difference, whether it\u2019s writing to lawmakers, whether it\u2019s posting important Breitbart articles on social media, whether it\u2019s showing up and attending events with people who are supportive of the president and showing your own encouragement, or whether it\u2019s talking to your friends and neighbors and just making sure they\u2019re all engaged and informed,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut all of these things cumulatively multiplied by thousands and thousands and thousands of people is going to make an extraordinary difference. So it\u2019s in your hands, to each and every one of your listeners, the fate of the future of the country.\u201d\n\nLISTEN TO STEPHEN MILLER ON BREITBART NEWS SUNDAY:", "description": "Stephen Miller said Americans can make a difference in the fight to stand alongside President Trump amid deep state efforts to impeach him.", "authors": ["Matthew Boyle"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/trump-supporters-rally-florida-2016-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
