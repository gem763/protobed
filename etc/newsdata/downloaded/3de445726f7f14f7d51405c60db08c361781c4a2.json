His father, actor Kirk Douglas, will celebrate his 103rd birthday in December.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m moving right along,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cI had a cancer bout about eight or nine years ago where I sort of thought about [aging]. Once I got a clean bill of health after that, it was kind of straight on, feeling good.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving a younger bride makes me feel good on one side; I\u2019ve got the old man over here on the other side who still has a full head of hair,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s all good. You can\u2019t be an idiot about it. So 75, I look at the 15-year program, if I still got my marbles by the time I\u2019m 90. After that, it\u2019s all golden.\u201d\n\nDouglas said he keeps active by working out and playing golf. He jokingly told host Ellen DeGeneres his golf game hasn\u2019t improved with age.\n\n\u201cI do a cardio mixup with weights,\u201d he shared. \u201cI recently have been having some trouble with my back playing golf, so I\u2019m working with a trainer now, doing a little more core and body work in other areas.\u201d\n\nDouglas is parent to three children, son Cameron with Diandra Luker and son Dylan and daughter Carys with Zeta-Jones, and grandparent to Cameron\u2019s daughter, Lua. He said Dylan, 19, has proven to be a daredevil.\n\n\u201cHe just did a skydiving thing,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cI remember that age. It\u2019s a hormonal thing, I think for boys, testing yourself.\n\n\u201cWhat I did not like is he was the first one to jump,\u201d he added. \u201cI said, \u2018Don\u2019t be the first one to jump. Let a couple people go off first to see if there\u2019s any rocks in there.\u2019\u201d\n\nDouglas plays Sandy, an acting coach and a dad to Mindy (Sarah Baker), in the Netflix series The Kominsky Method. The show co-stars Alan Arkin and Nancy Travis, will return for a second season featuring Jane Seymour on Oct. 25.", "description": "Oct. 10 (UPI) \u2014 Michael Douglas is \u201cfeeling good\u201d following his 75th birthday.
