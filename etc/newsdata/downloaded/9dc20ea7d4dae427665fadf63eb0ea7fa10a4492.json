But deep in the field, Brad Keselowski was going backward, and the spots he lost in the elimination race at Kansas Speedway were enough to send Elliott through in the final cut-off spot to the round of eight. Hamlin won the race. Elliott felt almost as if he did.\n\n\u201cYou have to stay fighting in these things, especially with the late-race restarts,\u201d he said. \u201cJust excited we get to fight another race. Back up against the wall, to come out here and battle for the win, that\u2019s what you have to do when you\u2019re in the position we were in.\u201d\n\nIn a bit of irony, it was Keselowski who helped bring out the caution in the first overtime when he got into Daniel Suarez and triggered a wreck that collected teammate Joey Logano. The field was nearing the start-finish line but the caution light came on before the leader took the white flag.\n\nIf Hamlin had crossed a split-second quicker, the race would have been over and Keselowski safe.\n\n\u201cI pushed as hard as I knew how and didn\u2019t quite do good enough on the last restart and that was it,\u201d Keselowski said. \u201cWe clawed as hard as we could and there were times it looked like we were going to be fine and times it didn\u2019t. In the end it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nKyle Busch ultimately finished third, followed by Kurt Busch and William Byron. But the key was Keselowski, who dropped from 13th to 19th on the final restart and out of the next round of the playoffs. He ended up three points \u2014 equal to three positions on the track \u2014 below the cutoff line.\n\nByron was the next driver eliminated despite a strong run at Kansas, where he would have needed a win to advance. Alex Bowman and home-state hero Clint Bowyer also were eliminated.\n\n\u201cI did think we were OK,\u201d Keselowski said, \u201cbut obviously we weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe win was the fifth this season for Hamlin, who already was in good shape to advance but picked up valuable playoff points with the win. He\u2019d finished in the top five at Kansas twice in the past couple years, but the trip to victory lane was the first for his Joe Gibbs Racing team since 2012.\n\n\u201cThis was a tough track for us. We didn\u2019t run very good here in the spring,\u201d said his crew chief, Chris Gabehart. \u201cWe got a few key adjustments that turned us into a dominant car.\u201d\n\nThe frenzied push to the finish Sunday began when Blaney scraped the wall with 14 to go, causing his tire to go down and a caution flag to fly. Elliott was three points behind Keselowski at that point, but the savior of Hendrick Motorsports\u2019 playoff hopes made a big move on the restart to climb to fourth place, and that put the pressure right back on Keselowski to make up ground.\n\nElliott was still in good shape until another caution flew, jumbling the front of the pack and giving Keselowski a chance. He made a quick stop and picked up three spots on pit road, putting Elliott back in a situation where it appeared he would need a victory to advance.\n\n\u201cI was under the impression,\u201d he said.\n\nThe entire field got through the first playoff restart cleanly, but Keselowski ran out of room deep in the pack and nudged Suarez, sending him into the wall. Logano also was heavily damaged in the wreck, throwing his own playoff hopes into question as another OT approached.\n\nHamlin got a good jump on the restart, and Elliott dived low and got in line. He immediately moved forward into second place while Keselowski began hemorrhaging positions, and the change that was made in the final two laps was enough to send Elliott into the next round.\n\n\u201cIf you ever get to Homestead, you\u2019re going to have to fight for a win,\u201d he said. \u201cProud of the effort. Learned a lot. To be able to come out here and, like I said, in our minds have to win, come and fight for one, to finish second, I think is step in the right direction for us.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Hamlin roared away with a push from behind from teammate Kyle Busch on the second shot at a green-white-checkered finish, and Elliott was unable to chase him down.
