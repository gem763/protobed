I\u2019m not talking about a typical gold bull market. This gold bull market is riding a huge, unstoppable trend: Gold is being re-monetized and is returning as money. Back in June, I showed you eight reasons why.\n\nEasy Money\n\nAs I explained then, one of the biggest reasons is the Federal Reserve\u2019s reversal from a policy of tightening to pumping out more easy money.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s board members are not in the habit of admitting there\u2019s ever anything wrong with the economy. Acknowledging they have no control over the situation, or that things can go off the deep end, is not an option.\n\nBut the recent rate cuts were just that \u2013 an admission of weakness. Why else would you need to cut rates if this is the \u201cgreatest economy ever,\u201d as Trump has claimed?\n\nThe bulls realized this and sent gold soaring right through the psychologically significant $1,500 level last month. Gold has decisively broken out of its six-year trading range:\n\nGold Price Chart\n\nOf course, from the perspective of mining companies themselves, the number itself is not that important. But the magnitude is. The companies that were making $100 an ounce at $1,300 gold prices, would be making three times as much profit at $1,500 gold. It\u2019s the reason why gold mining stocks offer enormous upside as the price of gold rises.\n\nGrowing Reserves\n\nAside from the Fed\u2019s return to easy money, there\u2019s another significant catalyst for prices.\n\nCentral banks bought a record 651 tonnes of in 2018. It was the highest level of net purchases since 1971 when Nixon closed the gold window. And it\u2019s a 75% increase from 2017.\n\nCountries like Russia and China are buying to reduce their reliance on the US dollar and exposure to US financial sanctions.\n\nLast year, Russia notably dumped $101 billion worth of US Treasuries, and according to the World Gold Council, it replaced much of it with . The country\u2019s reserves have quadrupled in the last decade alone. Russia is now the fifth-largest holder of gold in the world.\n\nRussia and China have continued their buying into 2019. I don\u2019t see any signs that either of these two countries will slow down. I expect the opposite.\n\nOther nations like Iran, Turkey, and Venezuela use for trading (in energy and other goods) to bypass US restrictions and sanctions.\n\nAll this is accelerating the trend of gold\u2019s re-monetization.\n\nRoom to Run\n\nGold Price Chart\n\nDespite its recent spectacular performance, I believe still has enormous upside. Remember, the price of gold is nowhere close to its all-time high.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: The stars have aligned for prices. A bull market of historic proportions is on the menu and likely is already in its early innings.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s not too late to take advantage.\n\nThe possibility of a correction is always there, of course. I think it would be healthy for prices to level off and consolidate before going higher. After all, nothing ever goes up in a straight line. It dipped below $1,500 last month already, but only temporarily.\n\nWith the Fed\u2019s recent rate cuts and the dollar continuing to weaken, it\u2019s hard to see prices correcting much more and staying low. I see pullbacks as an excellent buying opportunity. \u2013 Nick Giambruno", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Commodity Trade Mantra  covering: XAU/USD, Gold Futures.
