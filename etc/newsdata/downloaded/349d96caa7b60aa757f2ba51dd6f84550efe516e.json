She hasn\u2019t talked to me in, like, two years.\u2019\n\nThe majority of the Kardashian-Jenner clan turned up to wish Caitlyn a happy birthday (Picture: Instagram)\n\nBrody was also left hurt after Caitlyn didn\u2019t attend his wedding to Kaitlynn Carter last year in Indonesia, though the rift between them has lasted longer than the marriage itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said on The Hills: New Beginnings: \u2018Honestly, it really did hurt and I would have loved to have had her there, but she had better things to do, apparently.\u2019\n\nBrody and Kaitlynn ended up splitting up over the summer, before she had a short-lived, six week fling with Miley Cyrus.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
