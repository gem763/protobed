[nL3N26L0UG]\n\nThe BOJ started the survey on corporate price expectations from the tankan in March 2014 to gather more data on inflation expectations, key to its current stimulus program.", "description": "Japan corporate inflation expectations stagnate, keep BOJ under pressure", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9103B_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
