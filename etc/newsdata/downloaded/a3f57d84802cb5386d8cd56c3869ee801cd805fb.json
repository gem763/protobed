No matter that this particular baby has blue skin and is considerably larger than the potter himself; there\u2019s still a distinct softness, as well as a practised assurance, to the man\u2019s movements as he smooths his cloth over the cheek of the giant statue of baby Krishna.\n\nIn most places, a giant statue of baby Krishna would be something to marvel at. Here, there are literally dozens of them on one stretch of street, all in various states of completion. We are strolling through the riverside district of Kumartuli \u2013 or \u201cpotters neighbourhood\u201d \u2013 in Kolkata.\n\nThe artisans are busy year round, but festivals involve a frenzy of preparation. Manjit Singh Hoonjan\n\nFor generations the city\u2019s sculptors have lived and worked here, creating statues of the colourful gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon. As we stroll down the narrow streets, dozens of craftsmen are hard at work outside their open-fronted workshops. Each one is churning out round-bellied baby Krishnas in all sizes, from knee-high versions to two-metre tall statues.\n\nAs we watch, one craftsman outlines the eyes of a giant Krishna, his moves as practised as a model applying eye liner.\n\nCome on a different day and these same artisans could be working on serene Vishnus or dancing Shivas. Their output changes every month, depending on which festival is up next. The busiest months are between August and October in the lead-up to two of the Durga and Kali festivals, but work is always under way.\n\nVisitors can also buy smaller statuettes year round, with popular choices including the elephant-headed Ganesh and the fearsome goddess Kali, recognisable by the skulls draped around her neck and and her blood-soaked mouth.\n\nOnce the eyes are finished, the god is said to inhabit the statue. Manjit Singh Hoonjan\n\nIt\u2019s not just deities on display; we also pass several busts and sculptures of a magnificently mustachioed individual. \u201cThat\u2019s Abhinandan Varthaman,\u201d my guide, Manjit Singh, tells me. The Indian pilot, who was shot down over Pakistan earlier this year, is apparently a hot-ticket item at the moment.\n\nAs we walk through the area, home to around 150 families, we are greeted with smiles. Singh, it turns out, knows many of the locals by name. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here for 15 years,\u201d he says. Singh is a professional photographer and a tour guide, leading photographic walking tours of Kolkata\u2019s most interesting neighbourhoods. Fancy cameras are optional; Singh doesn\u2019t flinch when I pull out my iPhone to start snapping away. \u201cThese tours aren\u2019t about showing off your equipment,\u201d he says.", "description": "From its gigantic statues of baby Krishnas to sculptures of dancing Shivas, the potters' realm of Kolkata is a riot of spectacle.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3504%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_273/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d0cbbff5d539e551a32ff623a8278fe62c896189", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
