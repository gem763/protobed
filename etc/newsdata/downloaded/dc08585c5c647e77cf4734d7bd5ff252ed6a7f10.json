USA TODAY\n\nCurbside pickup is moving away from the curb.\n\nOn Tuesday, Los Angeles International Airport joined the growing list of airports where curbside traffic has gotten so bad that taxis and ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft are no longer permitted to pick up at passengers at the curb.\n\nThe solution at LAX is to move the pickup area for both taxi and ride app users away from the terminal curb to an entirely new area dubbed \u201cLAX-it,\u201d just east of Terminal 1.\n\nLAX noted on its Twitter account Tuesday that LAX-it was open with \"lots of helpful people on hand to direct traffic\" and help travelers find their rides.\n\n#LAXit is open and starting to get busier as flights arrive. We have lots of helpful people on hand to direct traffic and help you find your ride! pic.twitter.com/GW2201J3Ku \u2014 LAX Airport (@flyLAXairport) October 29, 2019\n\nPassengers are able to walk to the new pickup area from some of the terminals, and a shuttle picks up passengers at all terminals in a dedicated lane on the lower/arrivals level lane.\n\nLAX officials say getting from the airport to the pickup lot should be no more than 15 minutes (from most terminals), and exiting the terminal should be faster because drivers no longer must battle backups in the Central Terminal Area.\n\nLAX-it has restrooms, benches, umbrellas and local food trucks along with cellphone charging stations and free Wi-Fi.\n\nFirst shuttles are on the way for the new #LAXit pickup lot. Keep in mind there is a new traffic pattern on the lower level starting now. Follow signs and directions. pic.twitter.com/RXWGMiaFJX \u2014 LAX Airport (@flyLAXairport) October 29, 2019\n\nLAX-it will only be for pickups. Ride app users and taxis will continue to drop off passengers at the terminal curbs on the upper/departures level.\n\n\u201cWe have heard from our guests that the current system with ride pickups can be frustrating,\" Keith Wilschetz said in a statement earlier this month. Wilschetz is deputy executive director for operations and emergency management at Los Angeles World Airports, which operates LAX.\n\n\u201cFrustrating\u201d is a polite way of describing how excruciating and time-consuming using a ride-hailing service at LAX can be. During peak times, app users spent upwards of 45 minutes to an hour between waiting for their ride to arrive curbside and sitting in traffic to get out of the Central Terminal Area.\n\nAnd bad curbside traffic would have gotten worse as the airport construction associated with terminal redevelopment and the new automated people mover begins.\n\n\u201cWe will be losing more than 30% of our curb front, so doing nothing is not an option,\u201d LAX spokesman Heath Montgomery said.\n\nOther LAX changes\n\nBecause there is a new dedicated bus lane, the traffic pattern on the lower/arrivals level at LAX will also change. Private vehicles will no longer have access to the inner lanes since those will be reserved for airport-operated shuttles and FlyAway buses.\n\nAccording to LAX, new passenger pickup areas for private vehicles are being designated along the lower level outer commercial island.\n\nHotel and private parking shuttles will be relocated to the upper level for both pickups and drop-offs.\n\nWhen in doubt, travelers should follow new signage or ask for help.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2019/10/29/lyft-uber-pickup-lax-moves-new-airport-area/2495472001/", "description": "LAX is to move the pickup area for both taxi and ride app users away from the terminal curbsides entirely to a new area, dubbed \u201cLAX-it,\u201d just east of Terminal 1.", "authors": ["Harriet Baskas", "Julia Thompson", "Usa Today", "Published P.M.
