You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\u201d she told world leaders in a blistering speech at the United Nations last month.\n\nBut instead of bestowing the prize on the 16-year-old Swede, the Norwegian Nobel Committee gave the prize to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who was praised for his efforts to \u201cachieve peace and international cooperation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhy was Thunberg passed over? How could so many forecasters have been so wrong?\n\nThe peace prize selection process is highly secretive \u2014 all the committee would reveal was that there were 301 nominations this year. The names of some contenders are made public by their nominators. Thunberg, for instance, was nominated by three Norwegian lawmakers. But the full list won\u2019t be released for 50 years.\n\nIt can also be hard to anticipate the winner because the selection reflects the idiosyncracies of five individuals picked by the Norwegian parliament.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t stop people from guessing \u2014 or betting \u2014 on the winner. On Thursday night, Thunberg was the favorite with bookmaker William Hill (2/5) and Coral (4/7).\n\nAD\n\nBut she had several factors working against her, according to analysts who have followed the award.\n\nAD\n\nHenrik Urdal, the head of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo, omitted Thunberg from the Nobel Peace Prize shortlist he publishes.\n\nHe explained his decision to The Washington Post, saying there \u201cisn\u2019t scientific consensus that there is a linear relationship between climate change \u2014 or resource scarcity, more broadly \u2014 and armed conflict.\u201d\n\nThe link between climate change and conflict is hotly debated. But climate change scholars say that while there isn\u2019t a straightforward relationship, there is a recognition that climate change adds to stresses in regions that could spark political instability and conditions that could foster conflict. The Pentagon has called climate change a \u201cthreat multiplier.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe prize has gone to environmental champions before. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and former Vice President Al Gore won \u201cfor their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.\u201d In 2004, it was given to Wangari Maathai \u201cfor her contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace.\u201d In 1970, it went to Norman Borlaug, sometimes called the \u201cfather of the green revolution.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Urdal said such picks would be less likely now, as the prize committee has sought to hew more closely to the original wishes of Alfred Nobel.\n\nIn his will outlining the prize, Nobel wrote that the recipient should be someone who has advanced the \u201cabolition or reduction of standing armies\u201d \u2014 which some have interpreted as requiring a direct connection to peace and conflict.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you make it too broad, it becomes a bit meaningless,\u201d Urdal said.\n\nJanne Haaland Matlary, a politics professor at the University of Oslo, agreed that Thunberg had been a \u201cwild card\u201d nominee. The link between climate change and conflict is still \u201cquite tenuous at this point,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone sees flooding can cause conflict, migration and so on, but this is no way well established as a security policy issue yet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also possible the timing wasn\u2019t quite right for Thunberg. The committee draws up a short\u00adlist \u201cof the most interesting and worthy candidates\u201d soon after the nomination deadline at the end of January. But some of the more impressive moments of Thunberg\u2019s activism \u2014 the global climate strikes, her transatlantic sail, her U.N. speech \u2014 came later in the year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe award undoubtedly would have been a huge PR boost for the teenage activist, who is currently in Denver, Colo., as part of a tour of North America. But Thunberg has said previously that she doesn\u2019t protest to \u201cget awards and prizes.\u201d\n\nShe tweeted to her 2.8m followers that on Friday she would be doing what she does every Friday: protesting against climate change.\n\nOf course, at her age, she may have plenty more chances to win.\n\nAD", "description": "The teenage climate activist was the odds-on favorite.", "authors": ["Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZT5hbspC34pNwzmqKfDMLdoOar8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HR2SA3XL3YI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
