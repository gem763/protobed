The house serves as a laboratory for the firm\u2019s ongoing research into sustainable architecture.\n\nBorn into an Air Force family in Maine, Mr. Kovac\u2019s travels included long stays in Okinawa, Japan. And among his early influences were aviation, aircraft and Eastern cultures.\n\nMore: New York Real Estate Investor and Developer Says Despite Challenges, Manhattan\u2019s Market is Still a Leader\n\nEarly in his career, Mr. Kovac, 56, worked in the office of modernist Jerrold Lomax, before founding Kovac Architects (now known as Kovac Design Studio) in 1988; he soon earned a number of commissions for high end health clubs, commercial spaces, and detail-rich residences, including homes of celebrities and other bigwigs.\n\nWe caught up with Mr. Kovac to discuss the importance of materiality, why California\u2019s wine country is booming and more.\n\n\n\nMansion Global: Describe your dream property.\n\nMichael Kovac: It would always be a property with a strong connection to nature and proximity to an interesting city.\n\n\n\nI like distant views, unless the property is right on the water, in which case that\u2019s spectacular.\n\n\n\nI live in Pacific Palisades, and a have a view of the Santa Monica mountains and the city beyond. Especially at night, it\u2019s beautiful, and you still feel removed from the city.\n\nAnd my wife and I just bought a property a few years ago in Sonoma. It\u2019s similar in that it has sweeping views, but in the far distance, we see all the way to San Francisco. And if we want to go see a play or something, we\u2019re about 45 minutes away from San Francisco.\n\nMore: Designer Andre Fu Says a Home Should Reflect Its Neighborhood\n\nMG: Do you have a real estate property that got away?\n\nMK: We looked for a home in wine country for half a dozen years. We found a place with magnificent views on four acres, and we were just completely in love it. When we did some research, we realized the parcel right next to it could be built upon, and it would be like being back in suburbia, so we didn\u2019t buy it.\n\nI think we ended up doing the right thing, but we thought about it for years.\n\nMG: What does luxury mean to you?\n\nMK: It\u2019s really about what a house can do to restore your energy and rejuvenate you. It should be a calm escape, somewhere that also welcomes friends and family.\n\nIt\u2019s about inner wellness more than something you can just simply buy.\n\nMore: Holistic Wellness is the Perk Buyers Really Want, Says NYC Brokerage Chief\n\nMG: What area do you think is the next hub for luxury properties?\n\nMK: Wine country in California is on the upswing, as all the firms get their IPOs, it\u2019s quite easy for them to go up there and buy.\n\nThe area around Austin in Texas\u2014Lake Country. There\u2019s no state income tax and less regulation, so firms are moving there as well as people who are making huge sums of money as companies go public.\n\nMG: What\u2019s the biggest surprise in the luxury real estate market now?\n\nMK: It\u2019s just that the ultra high-end is booming. L.A. is still clearly considered a safe haven for international investors, and homes are still appreciating. I never would have thought there would be such a demand for those.\n\nFrom Penta: Gagosian Highlights Zao Wou-Ki\u2019s Friendship with I.M. Pei\n\nMG: Where are the best luxury homes in the world and why?\n\nMK: In California, because there are lots of clients and there\u2019s amazing architectural talent.\n\nI\u2019m also partial to places in the Alps. It\u2019s hard for them not to have unparalleled views. What I envy is that some of the most modern buildings have elements of the houses that were on the land for hundreds of years. The mix of those two things is incomparable.\n\nMG: What\u2019s your favorite part of your home?\n\nMK: The upper level has a wooden convex curving ceiling element, and the way that softens the light is amazing. It also encourages air flow.\n\nThe bigger surprise for me is the gentleness of the curve and how light falls against it.\n\nMore: Toronto Real Estate Investor Says Buyers Want Security\u2014Physical and Financial\u2014Above All Else\n\nMG: What best describes the theme to your home and why?\n\nMK: It\u2019s a home that\u2019s meant to be a sanctuary. There are a lot of elements that are very tactile.\n\nSound quality is an incredibly underappreciated thing to design for. Stark, hard surfaces can look glamorous and modern, but I cringe when thinking about what it\u2019s like to have a conversation there.\n\nOne of the best moments was when a friend of ours who\u2019s a very accomplished violinist came over and played for an hour. If you had to duplicate that in some of the properties I see, it would sound harsh.\n\nOurs is about an attention to materiality. You can\u2019t have everything be a strong material.\n\nMore: London Real Estate Expert Says Multimillionaires Know to Make Moves Even in a Downturn\n\nMG: What\u2019s the most valuable thing in your home?\n\nMK: There are two, and they\u2019re both art pieces. The outside of the home is made of fiber cement panels, and we commissioned an artist friend to create [a graphic representation of sycamore shadows] by sandblasting the shapes onto the house. The entirety of the outside is a piece of artwork. We\u2019re surrounded by sycamore trees and you can see the real sycamore shadows sliding across the embossed shadows on the panels.\n\nInside the house, we have a piece called \u201cLifesaver\u201d by Greg Miller. It\u2019s so integral that it\u2019s hard to imagine the house without it. We were in San Francisco for a friend\u2019s opening and we loved it but couldn\u2019t afford it. As the house went up, we put blue tape around it to save the spot.\n\nMG: What\u2019s the most valuable amenity to have in a home right now?\n\nMK: It\u2019s about thoughtfulness and personal restoration. You should be excited to come home, it should relax you, and you should leave rejuvenated and in a better place.\n\nSometimes it\u2019ll be explicit\u2014wellness rooms, saunas, spas, et cetera, but there are other things that are just as important, other ways to create value, and improve flow. The biggest compliment I get is that people don\u2019t want to leave their homes.\n\nMore: Italian Architect Says a Building Should Be \u2018Timeless,\u2019 and an Apartment Should be Comfortable\n\nMG: What\u2019s your best piece of real estate advice?\n\nMG: It\u2019s aboutlocation, obviously. But it\u2019s about looking for enduring quality, not a gimmick or a trend. The house and the site should be incredible in 20 years, too.\n\nMG: If you had a choice of living in a new development or a prime resale property, which would you choose and why?\n\nMK: For me, a new development if it\u2019s something that was built for me. Either way, I\u2019ll always choose a great space over maximizing return.\n\nMG: What area currently has the best resale value?\n\nMK: In L.A.,Bel Air, Trousdale and the Bird Streets. But I do wonder if the Bird Streets will hold up as well as the other two since there\u2019s not as much land and it\u2019s quite congested.\n\nClick to Read More Luxury Real Estate Professionals Share Their Insights\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Lucy Cohen Blatter"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-107004?size=1.7777777777777777&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
