That is changing, and Moody's rapid response to an incident that is only three days old shows how closely the ratings firms are monitoring companies for how they immediately respond to a breach. If Moody's proceeds with a negative outlook or downgrade, Pitney Bowes could find it harder to raise money and the stock price is likely to be affected.\n\nIn May, Moody's revised Equifax's future outlook down on ongoing impacts related to the consumer credit rating firm's 2017 breach. Equifax's outlook remains negative.\n\nPitney Bowes suffered a ransomware attack on October 14 that affected companies using its postage metering service, as well as commerce services including cross-border and shipping technology, according to the company.\n\nThe company informed clients throughout the week that their systems appear to not have been affected by the attack: \"In consultation with our security advisors on this issue, we do not believe there are other client risks. The meters themselves run operating systems that are not affected. The meters will continue to operate as normal,\" the company said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"The company's solid financial position, including good liquidity, make it unlikely this malware attack will have an immediate impact on Pitney Bowes' credit profile,\" Moody's said in a statement. \"Additionally, per the company's SEC filings, Pitney Bowes maintains insurance coverage for cybersecurity incidents, which may defray costs associated with the malware attack.\"\n\nAny future impact for the company will depend on the value of the encrypted data and how long the business interruption lasts, Moody's said.\n\nFollow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.", "description": "Before this year, ratings agencies rarely took a stance on how particular cybersecurity incidents could impact a company's credit or outlook.
