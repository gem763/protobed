There were nine babies born in the ward that day, Rippon recalls. Eight of them were called Gary.\n\nSubtle cues about \u201cmanly\u201d and \u201cladylike\u201d behaviours, from the moment of birth, mould our behaviours and abilities\n\nShe remembers chatting to one of the other mums when they heard a loud din approaching. It was a nurse bringing their two screaming babies. The nurse handed her neighbour a \u201cblue-wrapped Gary\u201d with approval \u2013 he had \u201ca cracking pair of lungs\u201d. Rippon\u2019s own daughter (making exactly the same sound) was passed over with an audible tutting. \u201cShe\u2019s the noisiest of the lot \u2013 not very ladylike,\u201d the nurse told her.\n\n\u201cAnd so, at 10 minutes old, my tiny daughter had a very early experience of how gendered our world is,\u201d Rippon says.\n\nRippon has spent decades questioning ideas that the brains of men and women are somehow fundamentally different \u2013 work that she compellingly presents in her new book, The Gendered Brain. The title is slightly misleading, since her argument hinges on the fact that it\u2019s not the human brain that is inherently \u201cgendered\u201d, but the world in which we are raised. Subtle cues about \u201cmanly\u201d and \u201cladylike\u201d behaviours, from the moment of birth, mould our behaviours and abilities, which other scientists have then read as inherent, innate differences.\n\nYou might also enjoy:\n\n\u2022 Why children become bullies\n\n\u2022 The dark side of believing in true love\n\n\u2022 The effect of childbirth no-one talks about\n\nRippon\u2019s writing bristles with frustration that this argument still needs to be stated in 2019. She describes many of the theories about gender differences as \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d myths that keep on arising, in another guise, no matter how often they are debunked.\n\n\u201cWe've been looking at this whole issue of whether male brains are different from female brains for about 200 years,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd every now and then there's a new breakthrough in science or technology, which allows us to revisit this question, and make us realise that some of the past certainties are clearly wrong. And you think that, as a scientist, you might have addressed them and put them right, and people will move on and not use those terms or conclusions anymore. But the next time you look at the popular press you find that the old myth has returned.\u201d\n\nThis media cannot be played on your device.\n\nYou can see Gina Rippon discussing these myths in the BBC Reel video above.\n\nOne of the oldest claims centres on the fact that women have smaller brains, which was considered evidence for intellectual inferiority. While it\u2019s true that, on average, women\u2019s brains are smaller, by about 10%, there are several problems with this assumption.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, if you just thought it was a \u2018size matters\u2019 issue, then sperm whales and elephants have got bigger brains than men, and they're not renowned for being that much brighter,\u201d says Rippon. Then there\u2019s the fact that, despite the average difference in size, the overall overlap in the distributions of men and women\u2019s brains is huge. \u201cSo that you get women with big brains and men with small brains.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Einstein\u2019s brain was smaller than that of the average male, and overall, many studies find that there is next to no mean difference between men and women\u2019s intelligence or behavioural traits. Yet the claims continue to persist in the media.\n\nRippon argues that the apparent structural differences within the brain itself have also been exaggerated. The corpus callosum, for instance, is the bridge of nerve fibres that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain, with some initial studies finding that this information highway is bigger in women\u2019s brain\u2019s than in men\u2019s brains. This was used to justify all kinds of stereotypes \u2013 like the idea that women are inherently illogical, since their feelings from the \u201cemotional\u201d right hemisphere were interfering with the processing in the cooler, rational left hemisphere.\n\nAs Rippon explains in her book: \u201cMen\u2019s more efficient callosal filtering mechanism explained the mathematical and scientific genius\u2026 their right to be captains of industry, [their ability to] win Nobel Prizes and so on and so on.\u201d\n\nBut such claims are often based on just a small number of participants, she says \u2013 and the techniques to measure the \u201csize\u201d of any region are still rather crude and open to interpretation, meaning that even the existence of such brain differences is on very shaky foundations. (And of course, the idea of the \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\" brain is itself something of a myth.) Despite decades of research, it has been very difficult to reliably identify significant \u201chardwired\u201d differences in the structure of the male and female brain.\n\nRaging hormones\n\nWhat about our sex hormones? Surely they, at least, should have a very clear impact on our minds and behaviours? Yet the evidence has been misinterpreted to denigrate women\u2019s abilities, Rippon says.\n\nWomen were initially barred from the US space programme, due to concerns of having such \u201ctemperamental psycho-physiologic humans\u201d on board the craft\n\nThe concept of premenstrual syndrome, for instance, first emerged in the 1930s. \u201cAnd it became well established as a reason for women not being given positions of power.\u201d As she points out, women were even initially barred from the US space programme due to concerns around having such \u201ctemperamental psycho-physiologic humans\u201d on board the craft.\n\nWhile few today would hold this view, we still consider PMS to bring about a range of cognitive and emotional changes that are less than desirable. Yet some of the observed symptoms may be a psychosomatic response \u2013 the result of expectation rather than inevitable biological changes to the brain.\n\nIn one study by Diane Ruble at Princeton University, for instance, women were given false feedback about where they were in their menstrual cycle. \u201cThey could give an approximate date about when they expected the period to start \u2013 but you could give them a fake blood test saying, actually, you are now in the pre-menstrual phase, or you're in the intermenstrual phase,\u201d Rippon explains. And they were then asked to fill out a questionnaire on various elements of PMS.\n\nThe study found that the women who were told they were in the pre-menstrual phase were much more likely to report the symptoms of PMS \u2013 even if they were not at that stage of the cycle, supporting the idea that some of the symptoms arose from their expectations. (Read about how the \u201cnocebo effect\u201d means our beliefs can produce real medical symptoms.)\n\n\u201cI wouldn't want to underplay the reality of the hormonal changes that are associated with the menstrual cycle, or to deny that people do have changes associated with fluctuations in hormones \u2013 as they should, because the word hormone means stir to action,\u201d Rippon says. \u201cBut if you actually look at things like menstrual diaries, or objective measures of mood changes, the effect is nothing like as profound as the person believes. So the very fact that you believe that [you are] experiencing a mood change, and that must be associated with the premenstrual cycle, becomes a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d\n\nThere are positive cognitive changes about the time of ovulation. Yet I haven't come across an \u2018ovulation euphoria questionnaire\u2019 \u2013 Gina Rippon\n\nThe perceptions of PMS also betray a certain confirmation bias among researchers studying sex and gender differences, who have tended to conduct studies that back up the stereotypes rather than looking for the evidence that may question prevailing assumptions. Rippon says that women may actually experience a cognitive boost at certain points in the menstrual cycle, for instance \u2013 but these have been largely ignored, thanks to scientists\u2019 preoccupation with women\u2019s perceived weakness.\n\n\u201cWe've done some studies showing that cognitively, there are fluctuations through the menstrual cycle,\u201d she says. Verbal and spatial working memory, for instance, improve when oestrogen is highest. \u201cAnd that there are very positive changes about the time of ovulation \u2013 improved responsiveness to sensory information, for example, and improved reaction time.\u201d\n\n(Read more about how the menstrual cycle changes women's brains \u2013 for the better).\n\nBut Rippon says that while the standard tool to measure PMS is the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire, \u201cI haven't come across an \u2018ovulation euphoria questionnaire\u2019\u201d. The focus, it seems, is always on the negative.\n\nPink and blue tsunamis\n\nOne of the challenges of studying sex differences has been accounting for the role of culture. Even when apparent differences in the structure of the brain can be observed, there is always the possibility that they arise through nurture rather than nature.\n\nWe know that the brain is plastic, meaning it is moulded by experience and training. And as Rippon observed with the birth of her own daughter, a boy and a girl may have very different experiences from the moment they enter the world, as certain behaviours are subtly encouraged. She points to research showing that children as young as 24 months are highly sensitive to gender typical behaviours. They are, she says, \u201ctiny social sponges absorbing social information\u201d, and adopting those behaviours themselves will eventually rewire their neural circuits. \u201cA gendered world produces a gendered brain.\u201d\n\nThis is why the gender stereotyping of toys is such an important issue to address.\n\n\u201cA lot of people think that the idea that we should avoid gendering toys is actually a bit of PC [politically correct] nonsense,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think if we take a neuroscientific approach to this, we can see that there's quite profound implications of the toys that we play with when we're very young.\u201d These moments of play can be seen as \u201ctraining opportunities\u201d that can mould a child\u2019s brain into an adult one.\n\nConsider a construction toy like Lego or Duplo or games such as Tetris. As the child plays, rotating bricks and finding increasingly inventive ways to fit them together into new structures, they will be building the neural networks involved in visual and spatial processing. Then, as you get to school, you might perform slightly better at those tasks \u2013 and be praised for your abilities, meaning you\u2019ll continue to practice them. Eventually, you may even find a profession that that asks you to spend all day, every day, strengthening those abilities.\n\n\u201cNow, if all of those toys and training opportunities are gendered, then you can start getting what looks like a clear gender divide based on the biological sex of an individual, as opposed to the different training opportunities that individual has had,\u201d says Rippon.\n\nThe psychologists Melissa Terlecki and Nora Newcombe have shown that the apparent sex differences in spatial cognition diminish when you account for the amount of time someone has spent playing video games like Tetris, for instance.\n\nA few campaigns \u2013 like Let Toys Be Toys in the UK and Play Unlimited in Australia \u2013 have had some success in persuading retailers to change their gendered marketing, but in general, Rippon argues that children are still being pigeonholed in many other ways.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems we have in the 21st Century is that what I call gender bombardment is much more intense,\u201d says Rippon. \u201cThere's much more in the social media, and a whole range of marketing initiatives, which make a very clear prescriptive list of what it's like to be male, or what it's like to be female.\u201d\n\nAnd this is why Rippon is especially frustrated by the \u201cneurosexism\u201d out there. The more that tenuous conclusions, from weak data, reach the public, the more likely we are to pass on these messages to children, strengthening those self-fulfilling prophecies.\n\n\u201cIf we believe that there are profound and fundamental differences between men's and women's brains, and more than that \u2013 that the owners of those brains therefore have access to different skills, or different temperaments or different personalities \u2013 that will certainly affect how we think about ourselves as male or female,\u201d says Rippon. It will also affect how we think about other people and what their potential might be, she warns.\n\n\u201cSo scientists need to be really careful,\u201d she says.\u201cOf course, we need to understand where there are sex differences and what they might mean. But we should be careful not to talk about fundamental or profound differences, because we're giving the wrong impression to people who are really interested to know what the answers are to the questions that we're asking.\u201d\n\nUltimately, we need to accept that each of us has a unique brain \u2013 and our abilities cannot be defined by a single label like our gender.\n\n\u201cAn understanding that every brain is different from every other brain, and not necessarily just a function of the sex of the brain\u2019s owner, is a really important step forward in the 21st Century,\u201d urges Rippon.\n\n*The video that accompanies this article is part of a BBC Reel Playlist called Re:Think, where you can watch more thought-provoking films about the human brain.\n\nDavid Robson is a writer based in the London and Barcelona.
