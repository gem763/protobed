Macy and daughter Georgia.\n\nStewart followed her surprisingly critical remark on a serious note, telling Stetler, \"She made a horrible mistake, and she\u2019s experiencing what happens,\" referring to Huffman's involvement in the collage admissions scandal and subsequent incarceration.\n\nMartha Stewart on Felicity Huffman: \u201cShe should style her outfit a little bit more.
