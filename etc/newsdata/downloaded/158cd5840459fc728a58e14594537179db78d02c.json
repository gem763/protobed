He said that, since local governments are subdivisions of the state, the state\u2019s claims should preempt theirs under a legal doctrine called \u201cparens patriae.\u201d Ohio is suing manufacturers and distributors in separate cases in state court.\n\nThe decision came from a three-judge panel from the Cincinnati-based Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which noted that trial preparations have been made already and that Ohio did not object when counties in the state started to make claims against the drug industry.\n\n\"In view of these circumstances, we decline to exercise our discretion to deploy 'one of the most potent weapons in the judicial arsenal,'\" the judges wrote, paraphrasing previous case law.\n\n\u201cThe 6th Circuit Court of Appeals did not say the state\u2019s argument was incorrect or not valid, but that the issue should be addressed with the trial court,\u201d Yost said in a statement. \u201cAt this time, we are reviewing our options.\u201d\n\nIn its ruling, the Sixth Circuit granted a motion by Ohio and 12 other states. as well as the District of Columbia, to file friend-of-the-court briefs in the Cleveland case.\n\nU.S. District Judge Court Dan Aaron Polster, who is handling the Cleveland cases, rejected an earlier attempt by Yost and other attorneys general to block some local governments from taking the lead in trying to negotiate a settlement.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nA ruling from a separate 6th Circuit panel rejected the argument from defendants that Polster should recuse himself from the trial because of prejudice against the defendants in comments in court and to reporters.\n\n\"We must take his statements in context,\u201d the panel said. \u201cJudge Polster equally placed blame on all parties, readily acknowledged that settlement efforts might not work, and acknowledged that both sides had compelling arguments.\u201d\n\nOpioids, a category of drugs that includes prescription versions and illegal drugs such as heroin \u2014 have been linked to more than 400,000 deaths in the U.S. since 2000.

As this happened, the companies allegedly disregarded their legal obligation to ensure that the pills were not diverted to non-medical uses.\n\nFive drug companies have reached a settlement with the two counties in order to avoid the first federal trial over the nation's opioids crisis.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % JNJ JOHNSON & JOHNSON 129.06 -0.16 -0.12%\n\nOn Oct. 1, Johnson & Johnson, and its Janssen Pharmaceutical subsidiary reached a settlement worth more than $20 million with Cuyahoga and Summit counties.\n\nJ&J did not admit liability in the settlement, which called for the company to pay $10 million to the counties and includes provisions for the company to reimburse the counties up to $5 million for legal expenses. The company will also contribute another $5.4 million to nonprofit organizations that deal with opioids.\n\nOn Sept. 8, Mallinckrodt PLC tentatively agreed to a settlement with the two Ohio counties worth $30 million.
