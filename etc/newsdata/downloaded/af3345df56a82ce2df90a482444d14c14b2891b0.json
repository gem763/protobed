To rewind a moment, Kim\u00e2\u20ac\u201dalong with her sister Kourtney Kardashian\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtook her kids to Armenia and got baptized just a few days ago. It was clearly a special and personal experience, and she shared a bunch of gorgeous photos of the event to Instagram.\n\n\"Thank you Armenia for such a memorable trip,\" Kim wrote in a post featuring a picture of her and North. \"So blessed to have been baptized along with my babies at Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, Armenia's main cathedral which is sometimes referred to as the Vatican of the Armenian Apostolic Church. This church was built in 303 AD.\"\n\nOkay, so as you can see Kim is completely covered head-to-toe in what appears to be an appropriate outfit, but some of the more conservative corners of the internet are dragging her for wearing a bodycon dress. Which seems pretty ridiculous? Kim looks great, respectful, and shouldn't be expected to cover up the literal shape of her body. If it was good enough for the Armenian Apostolic Church, it should be good enough for IG, right?\n\nEither way, people are calling Kim out, with comments ranging from \"if u were baptized dress properly,\" to \"your outfit seems a little tight for a baptism,\" to \"what a disrespectful outfit for such a respectable event,\" to \"why would you wear such a dress to church?\"\n\nTruly, let Kim get baptized in peace, internet!!!!! Kay as you were.\n\nPhoto credit: Instagram More\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "Leave! Kimmy!
