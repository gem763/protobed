President Donald Trump said that there is a \u2018good chance\u2019 of reaching an agreement, following China\u2019s commitment to purchase big amounts of US farm products. But Donald Trump remains the major risk to the conclusion of any agreement. A tweet would suffice to shatter the market sentiment, again.\n\n\n\nNow, it is unsure how the ongoing impeachment inquiry would impact Trump\u2019s mood in October trade negotiations, but we believe that he may concentrate his efforts in sealing a much-desired trade deal with China to divert the market\u2019s attention from his impeachment inquiry and get the stock markets racing higher. There is no such thing as a market rally to brush off the impeachment talks and to regain Americans\u2019 appreciation into the 2020 presidential election year.\n\n\n\nNippon carmakers gain, Hong Kong stocks lag into the crucial October 1st \u2018celebration\u2019\n\n\n\nJapanese equities traded in the green, as Nippon automakers gained on news that the US duties on Japanese industrials would ease or end. Investors bought Toyota (+1.02%), Mazda (+2.54%), Subaru (+1.93%), Honda (+1.01%) and Mitsubishi (+1.01%) shares, while Nissan (+0.21%) and Suzuki (+0.18%) lagged in the morning trading session in Tokyo. The Japanese yen eased against the US dollar, giving a brighter smile to Japanese exporters.\n\n\n\nGold tumbled more than $30 an ounce since yesterday to $1503. The US 10-year yield settled near the 1.70% mark.\n\n\n\nHang Seng (+0.29%) recorded timid gains; Shanghai\u2019s Composite (-0.73%) remained offered as the trade optimism was overshadowed by a rising anxiety regarding the situation in Hong Kong as China\u2019s Communist Party prepares to celebrate its 70th anniversary on October 1st. Investors could further trim their exposure to Hong Kong stocks, as October 1st celebrations are expected to fuel the anti-China protests in the city\u2019s streets and further weigh on the business sentiment.\n\n\n\nUS dollar and US futures edge lower before GDP data, as DoJ announces parallel investigation on Facebook\n\n\n\nIn what could be a fragile recovery, the S&P500 and the Dow Jones advanced 0.62% and 0.61% respectively on Wednesday. Nasdaq gained 1.05%.\n\n\n\nUS tech stocks led gains in New York, as Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet bounced higher on improved sentiment.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) threw a parallel investigation on Facebook, on top of a Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) probe already underway. Earlier this year, the FTC and the DoJ began a wide antitrust investigation on US\u2019 four tech giants to examine whether they acted in a way to harm competition in the tech industry. According to an agreement, the FTC would concentrate on Facebook and Amazon, while the DoJ would crack its brains on Apple and Alphabet. But now, Facebook is targeted by both entities. The latter news could weigh on Facebook\u2019s share price in the short-run, but overall, investors remain highly attracted to the US\u2019 most popular growth stocks. According to a Bloomberg survey, 87% of investors advise investing in Facebook with a twelve-month average target price of $231 per share, compared to the actual price of $182.80.\n\n\n\nOn the macro front, the US GDP is expected to have grown 2% in the second quarter, down from 3.1% printed in the first quarter of this year, as the negative impact of the trade frictions with China start showing up through a visibly weakened economic data.\n\n\n\nUS stock futures edged lower as the US dollar gave back gains in Asia, but that could change quickly. A soft GDP read could encourage Donald Trump to show more willingness to reach a trade deal with China besides fueling the expectations of another rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and support a further upswing in US equities.\n\n\n\nCable to reverse bullish trend on Brexit debacle\n\n\n\nThe pound fell to 1.2348 against the US dollar, the major 38.2% Fibonacci retracement on September rebound, on failure to clear the 1.25 offers on Supreme Court\u2019s decision to reconvene Parliament. This means that investors expect nothing to change over the past couple of weeks in the UK\u2019s political debacle regardless of suspended or unsuspended Parliament. In contrary, the pound will likely start feeling the pinch of snap election talks that could bring more uncertainty to the mix, though the Labour Party will likely reject an early vote before the October 31st deadline is off the table.\n\n\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, a move below the 1.2348-support should send the pound to the bearish consolidation zone and encourage a further decline to 1.2273 (50% retracement) and 1.2198 (major 61.8% retracement).\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, cheaper pound wets investors\u2019 appetite in British blue chips. The FTSE 100 remained immune to the sell-off that hit other European indices on Wednesday. The index rebounded off its 200-day moving average, 7224p, and closed a touch below the 7300p level.\n\n\n\nfutures hint at a flat start on Thursday.\n\n\n\nOpening calls\n\n\n\nto open 12 points lower at 7278\n\n\n\nto open 6 points lower at 12228\n\nDisclaimer: The information and comments provided herein under no circumstances are to be considered an offer or solicitation to invest and nothing herein should be construed as investment advice.
