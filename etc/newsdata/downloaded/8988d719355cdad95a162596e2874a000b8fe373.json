Hale's statement went further, adding that the decision's effect on democracy was \"extreme.\"\n\nIn an otherwise damning verdict, some relief was found for Johnson after Hale said the 11 judges had decided not to rule on Johnson's motive to prorogue.\n\nImmediately following the decision, and speaking on the steps of the Supreme Court, the Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry said Johnson must now step down.\n\n\"His position is untenable and, for once, he should have the guts to do the decent thing and resign,\" she said.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn told an audience at his party conference in Brighton that Johnson should now consider his position and that U.K. MP's should open the doors of Parliament immediately.\n\n\"The PM has acted wrongly in shutting down Parliament. It demonstrates a contempt for democracy and an abuse of power by him... I will be in touch immediately to demand that parliament is recalled.\"\n\n\"I invite Boris Johnson, in the historic words, to consider his position and become the shortest-serving prime minister there has ever been.\"\n\nThe deputy leader of the main opposition Labour party Tom Watson echoed that sentiment on Twitter.\n\nOn Tuesday, in New York, Johnson told reporters he disagreed with the Supreme Court verdict but he would respect it. Striking a slightly defiant tone, Johnson said he would continue working toward Britain's exit from the European Union.\n\nIn a BBC interview, Johnson also hinted that he would prorogue the Parliament again in a bid to hold a queen's speech to set out a new legislative program.", "description": "Government opponents say the U.K. Supreme Court decision is a victory for democracy.", "authors": ["David Reid Willem Marx", "David Reid", "In Cnbcdavy", "Willem Marx"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106145677-1569322675670gettyimages-1170565120.jpeg?v=1569322744"}
