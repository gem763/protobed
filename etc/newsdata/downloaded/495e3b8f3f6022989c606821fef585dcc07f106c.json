But the champions recovered a 17-0 deficit after the break with scores from Hannah Botterman, Sarah McKenna and Libby Lockwood to edge to a dramatic four-point victory.\n\nVictory for Harlequins, who also maintained their unbeaten start to the season, means the league is already turning into a familiar two-horse race between last year\u2019s beaten finalists and their London rivals. Karen Findlay\u2019s outfit claimed a confident 39-12 victory over Gloucester-Hartpury at The Stoop, where just five points separated the sides at half-time after Zoe Aldcroft cancelled out Leanne Riley\u2019s early try. But Shanaugh Brown\u2019s double inspired three further tries from Quins\u2019 industrious forward pack after the break in front of a 1,720-strong crowd.\n\nElsewhere, Sarah Bern scored her third try in two games as Bristol Bears continued their impressive start to the campaign with a convincing 36-0 drubbing over Firwood Waterloo. The England prop - one of several to have her full-time Red Roses contract renewed last week - was one of five players to cross for the West Country side and condemn their struggling Merseyside opponents to a third straight defeat. Further scores after the break from Elinor Snowsill and Amy Coles ensured Kim Oliver\u2019s side secured the bonus point to move up to fourth in the table.", "description": "Champions Saracens underlined their resilience as they produced a stunning second-half comeback to edge Loughborough Lightning 28-24 and keep the pressure on league leaders Harlequins in the Tyrrells Premier 15s.", "authors": ["Fiona Tomas"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-union/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212128113-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq_4lZL6XGyKd1IzVfh-3zqhR0oWjcIvW4VDyV5L2RoS8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
