Some 217 were bought in in the first half of this year\n\nHigher-priced cars incur a greater amortisation charge than the others in McLaren's range, with its total amortisation bill rising 25.6% to \u00a369.4m\n\nLast year McLaren delivered 4,829 cars, a target which it previously said it expected to hit in 2022.\n\nOn reaching this milestone it increased it to 6,000 cars annually by 2025 and the documents state that it is 'on plan to deliver the targets'.\n\nThe growth will be partly driven by new models and in the first half of 2019 alone it invested \u00a3151m predominantly in developing its product range.\n\nEarlier this year McLaren launched convertible 'Spider' editions of its 600LT and 720S two-seaters and another car will be added to its Ultimate range next year.\n\nIt will cost even more than the Senna and be limited to just 399 units.\n\nMcLaren space age Norman Foster-designed headquarters in Woking, Surrey\n\nAll of McLaren's cars are built at its space age Norman Foster-designed factory in Surrey which is also home to its Formula One team.\n\nIt currently lies in fourth place in the F1 championship, which is its best result since 2012.\n\nOver the first six months of this year the team's revenue rose 9.2 per cent to \u00a375.9m driven by income from new sponsors such as Coca-Cola and British American Tobacco as well as higher prize money.\n\nIn contrast, in 2018 the team's revenue reversed 36.5% to \u00a3132.8m as its performance hadn't yet hit top gear.\n\nThe team represents 10.9 per cent of McLaren's revenue with 84.8 pe rcent coming from automotive and the remainder made by its applied technologies division.\n\nThe group is controlled by Bahrain's Mumtalakat sovereign wealth fund, which has a 57.7 per cent stake in it, with 14.7 per cent owned by the Saudi TAG Group, 10 per cent in the hands of Canadian tycoon Michael Latifi and the remainder held by minority investors.", "description": "British manufacturer McLaren has revealed that its revenue accelerated bu over a third to \u00a3697.6m in the 6 months to the end of June this year, driven largely by a surge in sales of its 211mph supercar.", "authors": ["Christian Sylt For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
