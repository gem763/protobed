But, Lessard said, rLoop is still only in the \u201cfinal stages\u201d of assessing the progress Arrivo\u2019s employees had made toward developing a type of hyperloop that relies on magnetic levitation (as opposed to the vacuum-based solution that was originally proposed by Elon Musk when he introduced the hyperloop idea in a 2013 white paper).\n\nArrivo was founded in 2017 by former SpaceX engineer Brogan BamBrogan, who was also a co-founder of Hyperloop One (which is now Virgin Hyperloop One). BamBrogan was ousted from Hyperloop One in 2016 after a blow-up with fellow co-founder Shervin Pishevar and other executives at the company. Arrivo shuttered in late 2018 after running out of money.\n\nrLoop was the only non-university team to make it to the finals of SpaceX\u2019s hyperloop contest\n\n\u201cI was very happy to see our IP go to rLoop,\u201d BamBrogan told The Verge in a text message. \u201cThey are an engineering-led organization with a great team.\u201d\n\nrLoop, meanwhile, was founded in 2015 after SpaceX announced plans to hold a hyperloop competition. Lessard and other members of the SpaceX subreddit eventually pulled together some 140 engineers and designers and became the only non-university team to advance out of the design round and into the final competition where they ultimately won an \u201cinnovation award.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a fairly close relationship over the years with Brogan, and we were disheartened when we heard that they were closing up shop,\u201d Lessard said. \u201cWe were in talks with [Arrivo] since that point to figure out exactly what they\u2019ve been working on, what was happening with the IP, and so we ended up acquiring it earlier this year.\u201d\n\nRelated Hyperloop startup Arrivo is shutting down as workers are laid off\n\nLessard said rLoop has had \u201cconversations with a number of key [Arrivo] employees\u201d and that \u201cmany of them have expressed the desire to see the concept through.\u201d\n\nA number of hyperloop startups popped up in the wake of Musk\u2019s 2013 white paper, though the idea is still in its infancy. Virgin Hyperloop One has amassed the biggest war chest in pursuit of the idea. The company raised $172 million earlier this year (with much of the investment coming from a major port operator in Dubai) to add to previous funding of $295 million.", "description": "rLoop has bought the intellectual property of Arrivo, a fellow hyperloop startup that went out of business last December, The Verge has learned. rLoop co-founder Brent Lessard confirmed the sale, but he would not disclose how much the group paid.", "authors": ["Sean O'Kane", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ieqUha8rte4emGrIwyO8GnWgVnM=/0x38:1740x949/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19296487/Screen_Shot_2019_10_17_at_2.10.12_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
