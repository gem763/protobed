By then browser company Netscape had already gained traction. To make sure Internet Explorer was the most-used of the two, Microsoft bundled it in with Windows, so over 90% of computer users would have have it has a default. In a recent look back at the antitrust case, Verge writer Adi Robertson described the practice as \"Microsoft controlling access to the web itself.\"\n\nIn the end, Microsoft was seen as a tech monopoly bent on crushing its competitors. It lost the case, and was sentenced to breaking itself up into smaller entities made up of its various divisions. The US Department of Justice dropped the ruling in 2001, so Microsoft never actually had to split up. But it did relax its barriers to third-party developers, opening the operating system up to competitors like Netscape, Mozilla Firefox, and eventually, Google Chrome.\n\nToday, less than 3% of worldwide users surf the web on Internet Explorer.\n\nGates's present-day argument in defense of big tech companies \u2014 that they're merely being innovative, not monopolizing \u2014 is similar to Microsoft's defense back in 1998. Gates told Schatzker, however, that his views have changed in the last two decades.\n\n\"I was naive about this, but that was a long time ago, and I didn't realize that as Microsoft gets itself \u2014 that we'd come under scrutiny,\" Gates said. \"And we went through our thing back in the 90s, and that's made us more thoughtful about this kind of activity.\"", "description": "Gates discussed the responsibilities of tech companies amid a slew of antitrust probes into Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple.", "authors": ["Ivan De Luce"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/56afd08b58c32384008b70ad-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
