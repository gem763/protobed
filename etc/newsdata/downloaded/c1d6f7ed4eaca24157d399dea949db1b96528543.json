Oil and gas continues to power homes, transportation networks and the economy, given the energy industry employs more than 250,000 people. Yet Canadians are increasingly worried about climate change, how to control emissions and where the industry fits into this equation.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Down to Business has focused on business issues with a political twist. This week, host Emily Jackson discusses the future of Canadian energy with Audrey Mascarenhas, the president and chief executive of Questor Technology, a company that aims to eliminate methane emissions from flaring.\n\nMascarenhas, an engineer with 35 years\u2019 experience in the oil patch and the chair of the federal government\u2019s clean technology economic strategy table, doesn\u2019t think protecting the environment and supporting the energy sector are mutually exclusive goals. She discusses why and what the government needs to do to support innovation in the energy sector.\n\nYou can listen below \u2014 or on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher and Google Play, where you can also subscribe to get new episodes every Wednesday morning.\n\nIf you have any questions about the show, or if there are topics you want us to tackle, email us: downtobusiness@postmedia.com.", "description": "Episode 26 of the weekly podcast from the Financial Post", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/emissions.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
