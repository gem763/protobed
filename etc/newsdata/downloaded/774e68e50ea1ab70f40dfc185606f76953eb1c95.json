Sexual violence will persist until we achieve gender equality in schools, universities, and workplaces. \u2014 Laura Hawks (@_LauraHawks) September 16, 2019\n\nResearchers who conducted the study also found that instances of forced sexual experiences led to lasting health and economic repercussions for many of the women.\n\nCompared with women whose first sexual experience was voluntary, women with forced sexual initiation were more likely to experience an unwanted first pregnancy or an abortion, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease and problems with ovulation or menstruation, according to the study.\n\nSurvivors of forced sexual initiation also more frequently reported illicit drug use, resided below the poverty line and had lower levels of education than women who engaged in consensual intercourse, the study said.\n\nThe study's researchers based their data on a sample of more than 13,000 women between the ages of 18 and 44.\n\nThe Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), an anti-sexual violence organization, defines consent as \"an agreement between participants to engage in sexual activity.\"\n\nThe organization emphasizes that consent \"should happen every time,\" saying, \"Giving consent for one activity, one time, does not mean giving consent for increased or recurring sexual contact.\"\n\nConsent is something people learn about when they're very young, but the lessons of it often fall aside in later years, according to Schroeder.\n\n\"Such messages as 'hands are not for hitting' and 'hands on your own body' are repeated throughout children\u2019s formative years,\" she said. \"The problem is, we stopped teaching those lessons and then failed to connect them to romantic and sexual relationships as kids get older.\"\n\nSome states are adding information about healthy relationships and consent to their sex education curriculum.\n\nIn May, Colorado became the ninth state in the U.S. to require teaching about consent as part of sex education in K-12 schools.\n\n\"I wholeheartedly believe we should be teaching more about consent, but at the same time can\u2019t expect that having a few class sessions on consent are sufficient to counteract the toxic masculinity that is pervasive in and valued by the dominant power structure in the US,\" said Schroeder.\n\nOther experts hope they are seeing a sea change as young people, particularly boys, grow up with different expectations of sexual encounters.\n\nDr. Harold Koplewicz, a psychiatrist and president of the Child Mind Institute in New York City, told ABC News last year he believes \"there's a very big difference between young men who are between 18 and 22 and older men who, let's say, are above 40 years of age. A lot of these guys have grown up with a different sensibility.\"\n\n\"Part of growing up is learning to make informed choices, not to give in to impulsivity,\" Koplewicz said. \"Becoming a man means learning to think about people other than yourself right now -- including how you\u2019ll feel in the future.\"\n\nDr. Sejal Parekh, a pediatrician and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit, contributed to this report.", "description": "A forced first sexual encounter can have health implications for women.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/metoo-2-gty-er-190917_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
