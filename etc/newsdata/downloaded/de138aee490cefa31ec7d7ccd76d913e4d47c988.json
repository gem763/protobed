That gathering yielded more insults than answers, with Trump calling House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a \u201cthird-grade\u201d or \u201cthird-rate politician\u201d (accounts vary) and having what she called a \u201cvery serious meltdown.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump: Tell us your plan to protect the US & reverse course in Syria. NOW,\u201d Schumer tweeted afterward.\n\nThere was no plan. There was only a letter. Trump, who had told Erdogan in an October 6 phone call that U.S. troops would move out of the way of a planned Turkish assault, followed up days later with a slapdash missive in which he warned the Turkish president \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d Then concluded: \u201cI will call you later.\u201d\n\nIt was too late. By the time Trump\u2019s phone call set a crisis in motion, U.S. diplomats were still, mostly unsuccessfully, trying to convince countries to take their detainees in Syria back for trial and imprisonment at home. \u201cIt\u2019s just a kick in the gut to the people who were trying to bring back these [ISIS prisoners],\u201d said a U.S. official. Erdogan, according to the BBC, threw Trump\u2019s letter away. The Turkish assault went ahead on October 9. Reports of prison breaks soon followed.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper declared in a statement that Turkey\u2019s \u201cunacceptable incursion\u201d had resulted \u201cin the release of many dangerous ISIS detainees\u201d and undermined the entire mission to defeat ISIS. A senior administration official told reporters on a background phone call this week: \u201cLook, we don\u2019t have a large footprint in Syria, so we can\u2019t be everywhere and know everything. We are very concerned about the potential for detainee releases from the prisons and as well as the IDP camps\u201d holding families of ISIS suspects. Some 800 people had reportedly already escaped from a camp for ISIS family members by then, Kurdish sources told media outlets, though the U.S. officials have not confirmed this. But the senior administration official\u2019s comment also underscored the fact that, as U.S. forces retreat further from northern Syria, they lose the ability to even know what\u2019s happening in the camps and prisons there, let alone control it.\n\nRead: Trump\u2019s gift to ISIS\n\nEven if none of this had happened\u2014not the Trump-Erdogan phone call, not the Turkish incursion, not the latest reported prisons breaks\u2014the detainee issue would be a crisis. Since the defeat of the Islamic State\u2019s territorial caliphate, the U.S. has relied on Kurdish-led militias to hold some 11,000 ISIS fighters, around 2,000 of whom were \u201cforeign fighters\u201d from outside Iraq and Syria, according to a Defense Department estimate. But officials have acknowledged that this was never a long-term solution; the Kurds were a non-state force running ad hoc detention centers in the desert, even as most prisoners\u2019 home countries kept refusing to take back their citizens to stand trial.", "description": "As Turkey stokes chaos in northern Syria, the U.S. has no new options to deal with the ISIS prisoners held there\u2014or what to do if they escape.", "authors": ["Kathy Gilsinan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2HFO1/facebook.jpg?1571260169", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
