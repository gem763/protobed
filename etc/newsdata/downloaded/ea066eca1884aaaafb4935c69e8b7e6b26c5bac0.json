We want a second round because it\u2019s clear there\u2019s been fraud,\u201d consultant Ruben Lopez, 62, told AFP.\n\n\u201cThe OAS and EU saw there was massive cheating.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday the European Union, United States, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia called for a second round runoff to restore trust and confidence in the electoral process.\n\nThe Organization of American States (OAS) had already expressed \u201csurprise\u201d and \u201cconcern\u201d over Monday\u2019s sudden shift in official tallies, which increased Morales\u2019s lead, and has agreed to look into the results.\n\n\u201cThese results should not be considered legitimate until the end of the requested scrutiny process,\u201d said OAS general secretary Luis Almagro, based in Washington.\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Friday he \u201cfully\u201d supported OAS scrutiny, though no date or conditions for such a mission have yet been publicized.\n\n\u2013 Back to work \u2013\n\nMorales, the longest serving president in Latin America, was back at work on Friday, making public appearances and inaugurating public works.\n\nBy midday he had already made two appearances in rural areas, thanking his supporters.\n\n\u201cWe respect and salute the urban vote, from outside, but the rural vote guaranteed the process of change and, as such, progress for the Bolivian people,\u201d said Morales.\n\nAlready president since 2006, Morales will now remain in the post until 2025.\n\nLeft-wing allies Cuba, Venezuela and Mexico sent their congratulations.\n\nVenezuela President Nicolas Maduro, on a trip to Azerbaijan, accused Mesa of attempting a \u201ccoup d\u2019etat.\u201d\n\nViolent protests have raged all week, and fresh clashes broke out on Thursday between supporters of both sides in Santa Cruz, the economic hub and opposition stronghold.\n\nOffices in the city housing Bolivia\u2019s electoral authority were set on fire, as security forces clashed with demonstrators in La Paz and elsewhere.\n\n\u2013 Scandal \u2013\n\nThe TSE has been heavily criticized for its conduct of the count process, including by its own vice president, who resigned.\n\nOn Monday, after the release of partial election results showed Morales just ahead of Mesa, mobs torched electoral offices in Sucre and Potosi, while rival supporters clashed in La Paz.\n\nA general strike went into force on Wednesday.\n\nMorales\u2019s very appearance on the ballot was itself a scandal.\n\nIn 2016, he tried to overturn term limits but lost a referendum. Yet a year later, the Constitutional Court authorized him to stand.\n\nBoth the TSE and Constitutional Court are made up of members appointed by Congress, where Morales\u2019s Movement for Socialism party has a majority.\n\nOne-time union leader Morales, his country\u2019s first ever indigenous president, was hugely popular until his referendum defeat.\n\nHe won the 2009 and 2014 elections with more than 60 percent of the vote.\n\nBut his popularity has waned amid allegations of corruption and authoritarianism.\n\nMorales points to a decade of economic stability and considerable industrialization as his achievements, while insisting he has brought \u201cdignity\u201d to Bolivia\u2019s indigenous population, the largest in Latin America.", "description": "La Paz (AFP) \u2013 Bolivia\u2019s electoral tribunal concluded its count of general election votes on Friday and confirmed the controversial reelection", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/de6cd1_supporter-bolivian-opposition-candidate-carlos-mesa-passes-burning-barricade-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
