In its own right, it has ascended from being a mostly backward country under the rule of Mao Zedong to being a genuine world power today.\n\nBecause of these advances, China by itself represents a serious challenge to the United States in many ways, which I discuss in my new book, \"Trump vs. China: Facing America\u2019s Greatest Threat.\"\n\nHowever, if it were to partner or cooperate with another country, such as Russia, China and its comrade could seriously threaten U.S. \u2013 and indeed global \u2013 security. This is the topic of this week\u2019s episode of \"Newt\u2019s World.\"\n\nHere is an example of what I\u2019m talking about: Imagine that China decided to invade Taiwan tomorrow.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: US MUST WAKE UP AND SEE CHINA FOR WHAT IT REALLY IS \u2013 BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE\n\nThis would put the U.S. in an incredibly difficult position. China insists that Taiwan is part of China \u2013 a position which the U.S. formally acknowledges. However, though the U.S. recognizes China\u2019s position, we still maintain strong, unofficial relations with Taiwan. Under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. has a commitment to provide assistance for the island\u2019s defense capabilities.\n\nLooking at years of public statements, support, and rhetoric, the U.S. would be expected to intervene on Taiwan\u2019s behalf \u2013 for the good of regional peace and international norms. Of course, this would be a complicated exchange.\n\nNot only has China made significant advancements in its military and weaponry, but it has largely occupied and militarized the South China Sea, claiming the territory as its own. So, any military incursion to defend Taiwan would require a perceived attack on China.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThis would create the potential for an incredibly intense conflict between two superpowers, which the United States might win \u2013 but at great cost.\n\nNow, imagine that China launches a campaign against Taiwan with the help of Russian air forces.\n\nThis would entirely change the dynamic, making it much more difficult and costly (in blood and treasure) \u2013 and much less likely for any sort of U.S. victory. Now, instead of a focused conflict with China over a specific piece of territory, the U.S. would have to decide whether it wanted to risk engaging with a cooperative China and Russia at the same time.\n\nFor many years, China and Russia were like two estranged communist relatives, but that is changing. In recent years, China and Russia have cooperated in a number of military exercises \u2013 and their first long-range joint air patrol in the Asia-Pacific region this past summer.\n\nChinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping has met with Russian President Vladimir Putin 24 times since 2013, while he has only met with his U.S. counterpart 16 times during that period.\n\nThis activity creates a real potential for a China-Russia strategic alliance which would turn much of our national security planning and strategy on its head.\n\nOn \"Newt\u2019s World,\" I had the opportunity to meet and speak with some of today\u2019s top experts on Russia, China, and the evolving relationship between the two. It was an enlightening \u2013 but also sobering \u2013 conversation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI hope you will listen to this week\u2019s episode and think deeply about the challenge a China-Russia partnership would represent to the U.S. and the world.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem that will not go away if we ignore it. It might get much worse.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY NEWT GINGRICH", "description": "For many years, China and Russia were like two estranged communist relatives, but that is changing.
