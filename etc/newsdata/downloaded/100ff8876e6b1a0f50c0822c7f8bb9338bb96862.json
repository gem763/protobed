There were no immediate reports of deaths.\n\nAs the governor of South Carolina ordered an evacuation of the entire coast as the storm threatened the US, Bahamian and tourists in places such as the Abaco Islands and Marsh Harbour, took shelter in schools and churches when Dorian made landfall as a category 5 storm with gusts of up to 220mph and a sustained speed of 185mph.\n\nWhen it struck land twice on Sunday afternoon \u2013 first in the Abaco Islands at then close to Marsh Harbour on Great Abaco Island \u2013 it equalled a record set by a Labour Day storm from 1935. That storm, which occurred before hurricanes were given names, ultimately left major damage in its wake in the Florida Keys.\n\nHubert Minnis, the Bahamian PM wept at a press conference: \u201cThis is probably the saddest and worst day of my life to address the Bahamian people...We are facing a hurricane, Hurricane Dorian that we have never seen in the Bahamas.\u201d\n\nJoy Jibrilu, director general of the Bahamas\u2019 ministry of tourism and aviation, said: \u201cIt\u2019s devastating.There has been huge damage to property and infrastructure. Luckily, no loss of life reported.\u201d\n\n\u201cPray for the people in the Bahamas,\u201d Donald Trump tweeted after returning to the White House from Camp David, to better monitor the federal response to the storm. \u201cBeing hit like never before, Category 5. Almost 200 MPH winds.\u201d\n\nEarlier he told a meeting of the federal emergency response agency (FEMA) at its headquarters: \u201cWe don\u2019t even know what\u2019s coming at us. All we know is it\u2019s possibly the biggest. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve ever even heard of a Category 5. I knew it existed. And I\u2019ve seen some Category 4s \u2013 you don\u2019t even see them that much. But a Category 5 \u2026 that\u2019s the ultimate, and that\u2019s what we have unfortunately,\u201d\n\nAs emergency responders in the Bahamas said they were preparing to assess the damage once the storm had passed, officials in the US warned residents along a large swathe of the south-eastern seaboard to be alert.\n\nWhile forecasters believe Dorian will no longer directly strike Florida, it is expected to turn sharply and move towards the US coast, staying just off Florida and Georgia on Tuesday and Wednesday. It is then likely to move towards the Carolinas.\n\nThe National Hurricane Centre on Sunday night said Dorian continued to batter Great Abaco. \u201cThe western eyewall is approaching eastern Grand Bahama Island. This is a life threatening situation,\u201d it added.\n\nEarlier, it issued a hurricane watch for Florida\u2019s east coast from Deerfield Beach north to the Volusia and Brevard county line. The same area was also put under a storm surge watch.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6082331952001\n\n\u2018It is a very, very powerful hurricane\u2019 Donald Trump says incoming hurricane Dorian is \u2018a problem\u2019\n\nIn Palm Beach County, the authorities ordered a mandatory evacuation for the eastern half of the county on Sunday afternoon. that included mobile homes, substandard housing, low-lying areas prone to flooding and homes along the intracoastal waterway.\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis warned residents: \u201cWe\u2019re not out of the woods yet.\u201d\n\nHe said that some forecast models suggested Dorian may yet move onto part of the Florida peninsula.\n\nIn Bahamas, authorities set up 14 shelters including one in Freeport on Grand Bahama (AP) More", "description": "Hurricane Dorian has caused major damage in the Bahamas \u2013 destroying homes and ripping roofs from buildings \u2013 as it made landfall as the joint-strongest ever Atlantic storm.
