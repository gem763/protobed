However it\u2019s understood both hosts negotiated individual allowances linked to survey and revenue performance.\n\nAs part of that negotiation, news.com.au understands Kyle could pocket almost $50 million from the new deal by the end of 2024.\n\nSpeaking to news.com.au after the announcement, Kyle was uncharacteristically coy about his huge pay day, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t discuss the absurd amount of money I get given to do something I love\u201d.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, the money\u2019s fantastic, but what really counts for me is the acknowledgment that what Jackie and I have created is one of the most successful shows on earth,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kyle and Jackie O Show is the number one FM breakfast show in Sydney with an 11.6 per cent audience share. That\u2019s a massive 3.4 per cent more than their nearest FM rivals, WSFM\u2019s Jonesy and Amanda.\n\n\u201cThere is no secret to the show\u2019s success,\u201d Kyle told news.com.au. \u201cUltimately it\u2019s genuine chemistry. I love working with Jackie and that simply can\u2019t be created; it\u2019s either there or it\u2019s not.\n\n\u201cA lot of other stations throw strangers together and scratch their heads when it fails miserably. Radio\u2019s actually really easy, it\u2019s just bad programmers that make it unnecessarily difficult.\u201d\n\nKyle and Jackie O\u2019s radio partnership began in 2000 on the Hot30 which aired nationally on stations owned by Southern Cross Austereo.\n\nThe pair didn\u2019t know each other before their first show and Jackie O was less than impressed when Kyle swore on their first night on air.\n\n\u201cHe said the \u2018F-word\u2019 as soon as he was on air in the opener,\u201d Jackie O told Osher Gunsberg on his Better Than Yesterday podcast recently. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was going to do that, but he knew in his head he was going to do that to shock me.\u201d\n\nThings didn\u2019t improve during their second show and afterwards Jackie O called her boss and said, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know how much longer we\u2019re going to give this, but I don\u2019t think this is going to work\u201d.\n\nBut then something changed.\n\n\u201cHe came back the next night and was amazing and we just gelled and it clicked,\u201d Jackie O said.\n\n\u201cThank god Jeff (their radio boss at the time) gave him a shot because that chemistry didn\u2019t happen immediately, it took us six or eight months to really develop it \u2026 but it just kept getting better and better.\u201d\n\nIn 2005, Kyle and Jackie O took over as hosts of the 2Day FM breakfast show in Sydney in a move that was largely orchestrated by Kyle.\n\nAt the time Kyle made the bold prediction that within 12 months he and Jackie O would dethrone Nova\u2019s Merrick and Rosso to become the most listened to FM breakfast show in Sydney.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what happened.\n\nRELATED: Jackie O forced to defend herself over poo jogger rumour\n\nWhat followed over the next decade was a period of unprecedented success with Kyle and Jackie O winning 52 consecutive radio ratings surveys (there are eight radio surveys per year) at 2Day FM.\n\nThe duo then stunned the radio industry at the end of 2013 when they announced they were leaving 2Day FM after contract negotiations broke down.\n\n\u201cThey (2Day FM) came with a contract but by then there was a lot of things we had heard that had been said behind the scenes about us, that we were on our way out,\u201d Jackie said on the Better Than Yesterday podcast.\n\n\u201cThey were still wanting to sign us, but when you hear things from people that suggest we\u2019re on our last legs, you then start to think, \u2018What do we do from here?\u2019\n\n\u201cKyle called me one night and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got an idea. What about we go to Mix FM and we rebrand it as KIIS?\u2019\u201d\n\nJackie assumed Kyle was \u201cin one of his moods\u201d and went along with what he was saying, with the belief he\u2019d have forgotten about it the next day.\n\nBut a month later she received another call from her radio offsider.\n\n\u201cKyle said, \u2018I\u2019ve just gone in and I\u2019ve told them I\u2019m resigning (from 2Day)\u2019,\u201d Jackie O. \u201cHe goes, \u2018We\u2019re going to Mix, babe\u2019.\n\n\u201cI was furious. I broke down in tears. I said, \u2018Kyle, I\u2019ve just signed a mortgage and I have not spoken to one person at Mix. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. Do they even want us or is that a figment of your imagination?\n\n\u201cI was petrified. It gave me no choice, I had to resign as well. I\u2019m not going to stay and do a show without Kyle.\u201d\n\nIn one of the most shocking moves in radio history, Kyle and Jackie O jumped ship to KIIS 106.5 at the start of 2014 and their loyal listeners followed.\n\nWhen the first round of radio ratings were released that year, Kyle and Jackie O were once again the number one FM breakfast show in Sydney.\n\nRELATED: Aussie boss making $459,000 a week\n\nRELATED: CEOs ripped for ridiculous wages\n\n\u201cThank God for Kyle because he makes these big moves,\u201d Jackie said on the Better Than Yesterday podcast. \u201cHe makes big moves and again this one paid off for us.\u201d\n\n2Day FM, the station Kyle and Jackie O left behind, has never recovered. It\u2019s since churned through six breakfast shows in six years with all of them axed due to poor ratings.\n\nSpeaking to news.com.au today, Kyle couldn\u2019t help but have a cheeky dig at his old radio network.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be said for how the Australian Radio Network was able to take a successful show like ours from Southern Cross Austereo and actually make it better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite obvious that ARN know how to steer our show\u2019s ship better than the flogs at SCA.\u201d\n\nKyle and Jackie O\u2019s contract news comes just two days before this weekend\u2019s Radio Awards in Brisbane.\n\nAs they are most years, Kyle and Jackie O are nominated for the big award on the night \u2014 Best On Air Team FM \u2014 and are up against Nova\u2019s Kate, Tim and Marty, WSFM\u2019s Jonesy and Amanda, Fox FM\u2019s Fifi, Fev and Byron, Nova\u2019s Chrissie, Sam and Browny and Triple M\u2019s Kennedy Molloy.", "description": "Kyle and Jackie O have signed on the dotted line of what\u2019s believed to be the biggest media deal in Australian history.", "authors": ["Andrew Bucklow"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d6b98f7d3bc1632df52e3570d29542d9?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
