Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg raised similar concerns in a speech in Washington last week, fearing the Chinese government\u2019s \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d might affect even what U.S. users of Chinese-based apps might consume.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn their letter, Schumer and Cotton questioned TikTok\u2019s terms of service, saying the app collects a wide array of data, including information about a user\u2019s location. TikTok officials say U.S. users\u2019 data is stored in the United States, but the lawmakers said they feared that TikTok \u201cis still required to adhere to the laws of China.\u201d\n\nThat could \u201ccompel Chinese companies to support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d they wrote.\n\nSchumer and Cotton further raised the possibility that TikTok follows Chinese censorship regulations and limits videos on sensitive political topics, including recent protests in Hong Kong. A review of TikTok conducted by The Washington Post earlier this year found that the service carried far fewer videos related to those demonstrations than other popular social media sites such as Twitter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd the lawmakers said that TikTok could be a \u201cpotential target of foreign influence campaigns like those carried out during the 2016 election on U.S.-based social media platforms.\u201d Russian-backed agents spread disinformation on Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites in the last presidential election, and Facebook recently revealed a new Russia-based effort targeting the 2020 race.\n\nTikTok has declined repeatedly to discuss its content-moderation policies, including those involving disinformation.\n\nThe letter to Maguire marks the second congressional request for the government to delve into TikTok. Earlier this month, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews the national-security implications of foreign acquisitions, to investigate the 2017 purchase by ByteDance of Musical.ly, an app that ByteDance merged with its own offering to create TikTok.\n\nAt the time, Rubio said the \u201cChinese government\u2019s nefarious efforts to censor information inside free societies around the world cannot be accepted and pose serious long-term challenges to the U.S. and our allies.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Sen.
