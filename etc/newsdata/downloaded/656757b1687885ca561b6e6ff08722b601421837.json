(AP) - A woman who was shot twice in the chest by a former Olympic equestrian athlete said her recovery has been overtaken by brutal online comments blaming her for the attack.\n\nLauren Kanarek told The New York Times that the first thing she saw after her first week of recovery from the Aug. 7 shooting were online comments wishing her dead.\n\n\u201cThey know there is a person suffering multiple gunshot wounds, bullet wounds,\u201d Kanarek told the Times. \u201cTo say those things, is something no one could ever imagine.\u201d\n\nKanarek and her fiance, Robert Goodwin, had moved into a farmhouse owned by Michael Barisone, a rider renowned in the dressage community, for training.\n\nBut tensions escalated after Barisone tried to kick them out because of flooding that caused him and his fiancee to move out of their residence, she said.\n\nBarisone wanted them to move out so he and his fiancee could move into where they were living, but they refused, Kanarek said.\n\nIn the weeks before the shooting, Barisone called 911 several times claiming Kanarek and her fiance were squatters.\n\nThe situation culminated with Kanarek being shot twice in the chest, leading to her being placed in a medically induced coma and an extensive surgery to repair damage to her left lung.\n\nBarisone has been charged with two counts of attempted murder and says the shooting was self-defense. His lawyer did not respond to requests for comment from the Times.\n\nBarisone appeared in court in August with his left arm in a sling, the result of a confrontation with Goodwin, who wrestled Barisone to the ground after he allegedly shot at him, too, but missed.\n\nBarisone\u2019s online support is partially due to his success from winning a team bronze for United States Dressage in the 2016 Olympics.\n\nKanarek has replied to several comments about her online, reminding the people that she was nearly killed.\n\n\u201cNo matter what - I was shot twice. It was not in self-defense. While plenty more story exists, what else matters?\u201d she wrote in one response. \u201cDo you condone trainers shooting their students trying to kill them? Sure looks that way.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A woman who was shot twice in the chest by a former Olympic equestrian athlete said her recovery has been overtaken by brutal online comments blaming her for the attack.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
