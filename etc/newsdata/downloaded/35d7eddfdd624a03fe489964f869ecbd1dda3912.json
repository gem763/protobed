Meaning a slide back to the previous range of $50-$53 per barrel for WTI and pop $55-$58 for Brent.\n\nIn any market situation where noise crowds out the nuances, one has to return to the basics.\n\nThe basics now suggest that amidst the din of the trade war, Brexit troubles and worries of a global recession, the only true indicator of oil\u2019s supply-demand in real-time is weekly EIA data.\n\nFor the past six weeks, the dataset from the Energy Information Administration has been most unusual due to anemic refinery activity. After crude stock builds for five straight weeks, a surprising inventory pop last week threw the bears off and brought the bulls charging back in.\n\nWe await what next week\u2019s EIA data brings - though without dramatic refinery comeback, more data/market flux seems certain, making a price call at this point even more difficult.\n\nGold, meanwhile, could have a surer footing at the $1,500 perch until Wednesday\u2019s Fed policy decision, where another quarter point rate cut is anticipated.\n\nEnergy Review\n\nAfter a midweek surge, oil\u2019s advance slowed by Friday, raising questions on how well the upward momentum will hold in the coming week.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark for New York-traded crude, and London\u2019s Brent, the global gauge for oil, settled Friday\u2019s trade up less than 1% each after drifting through most of the day with little meaningful change.\n\nBoth benchmarks had put in a spirited performance earlier in the week on data showing strong U.S. oil consumption.\n\nFor the week, ended with a 5.4% gain, reaching a 3-week high of $56.72. posted a weekly advance of 4.4%, hitting a three-week high of $62.09.\n\nOil had seen dreary trading until the U.S Energy Information Administration surprised the market on Wednesday, announcing a 1.7-million-barrel drop in domestic crude stockpiles, versus versus analysts\u2019 expectations for a 2.2-million-barrel build.\n\nThe EIA has also reported sharp drops in stockpiles of fuel such as gasoline and distillates in recent weeks as refiners\u2019 run rates fell to abysmally low levels amid long plant closures to meet new maritime fuel processing standards.\n\nAnother factor supporting crude prices last week was a Reuters report hinting at the likelihood of the forthcoming OPEC meeting in December considering cuts deeper than the 1.2 million barrels per day agreed by the cartel and its key ally Russia almost a year back.\n\nHowever, with at least six weeks to the OPEC meeting, any talk of production cuts at this point is price jawboning more than anything.\n\nWith a potential heightening in Brexit troubles and other worrying global data, oil may have more significant headwinds in the coming week.\n\n\u201cWhile we could see prices go even higher, I feel global macro events will determine the next move in oil, if the EIA doesn\u2019t, and we could go on sl0ooovlll range bound again,\u201d said Tariq Zahir, managing member at the oil-focused Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.\n\nEnergy Calendar\n\nMonday, Aug 28\n\nGenscape Cushing crude stockpile estimates (private data)\n\nTuesday, Aug 29\n\nweekly report on oil stockpiles.\n\nWednesday, Aug 30\n\nEIA weekly report on\n\nThursday, Aug 31\n\nEIA\n\nFriday, Nov 1\n\nweekly rig count.\n\nPrecious Metals Review\n\nBoth and returned to $1,500 pricing on Thursday and advanced modestly in that channel as the week ended, two weeks after dropping off the perch.\n\nGold is up around 17% on the year, emerging as one of the best performers among commodities in 2019, as investors plowed into the safe-haven amid currency devaluations, recession fears, Brent uncertainty and other tensions involving China and Iran.\n\nExpectations are still strong that the Fed\u2019s Oct 29-30 will yield in a third straight rate cut for the year and that could keep gold above $1,500 at least until Wednesday.\n\nStill, Investing.com\u2019s showed a chance of only 91% for a quarter-point easing by Friday versus Thursday\u2019s high of 95%. So, it remains to be seen if the central bank will pull the ultimate surprise by staying this time, instead of hiking.\n\nIf the Fed resists a hike, there\u2019d be questions for sure on whether gold will finish the year at or above $1,600 as some have forecast.", "description": "Energy & Precious Metals - Weekly Review and Calendar Ahead", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC6500Z_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
