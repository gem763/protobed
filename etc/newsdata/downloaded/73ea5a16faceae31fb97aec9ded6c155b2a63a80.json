Victory\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Portuguese liked our arrangement. It would be desirable to renew it, but it does not depend on us. Our firm will is to negotiate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will see if it\u2019s possible. It is essential for the country\u2019s international credibility, to give confidence to investors,\u201d Costa said, adding that he also meant to negotiate with the upstart People-Animals-Nature party (PAN) party.\n\nNegotiations are not expected to be as messy or as long as in neighbouring Spain, which still has no government more than five months after elections and is heading for a repeat vote in November.\n\nCosta has benefited from an economy that is growing more than the EU average, helped by increased exports and a booming tourism industry that last year saw visitors outnumber Portugal\u2019s inhabitants.\n\nLeaders of the Left Bloc and the Communists, which have backed Costa since the last election in 2015, both said they had no objections to him being nominated as premier and were open to negotiate if the Socialists committed to improving the lives of workers.\n\n\u201cThere is no obstacle for the president to appoint the prime minister and for the government to be formed and start working,\u201d said Communist leader Jeronimo de Souza. \u201cWe will determine our position depending on the PS\u2019 choices, on its budget instruments and the content of its legislative proposals.\u201d\n\nWith most of the votes counted, the Socialists led with 106 seats. This meant they were first but, with only four seats still not accounted for, they cannot reach the full majority of 116 seats in the 230-seat assembly.\n\nThe main opposition Social Democrats (PSD) won 28% of the votes and at least 77 seats, according to preliminary results.\n\nPortugal's Prime Minister and Socialist Party (PS) candidate Antonio Costa reacts after preliminary results in the general election in Lisbon, Portugal, October 7, 2019.

I still wish it was more, because the country needs to move quickly to tackle the climate emergency,\u201d PAN supporter Paulo Santos, 43, said at the party\u2019s evening rally.\n\nThe election already claimed its first political victim.
