REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage/File Photo\n\nAlexa Political Contributions, powered by Amazon Pay, the company\u2019s payment system, will allow customers to contribute up to $200 to a campaign simply by saying \u201cAlexa, donate to [candidate name],\u201d according to a blog post from the world\u2019s largest retailer.\n\nThe service will begin next month and will work only for candidates who have chosen to participate.\n\nAmazon both unveiled the technology and invited candidates to sign up on Wednesday, according to a spokeswoman. It does not plan to report how many contributions flow through the service and did not consult with the Federal Election Commission in creating it, she said.\n\nDonors may send dollars only to principal campaign committees, not political action or independent expenditure groups.\n\nThe service is part of Amazon\u2019s effort to become a center of election information. It is also updating Alexa with information about candidates, polls, endorsements, caucuses, policy stances and key dates, with the help of nonpartisan organizations.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Echo device, which is how most users interact with the digital assistant, will command nearly two-thirds of the smart speaker market this year, according to research firm eMarketer.\n\nMost Democratic presidential candidates, including front-runners Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, currently rely on the small-dollar donation platform Act Blue, with \u201cDonate\u201d buttons on their web sites taking contributors to secure pages run by the service for one-stop donating.\n\nRepublican President Donald Trump, the Republican National Committee and the party\u2019s committees for electing Republicans to the U.S. Congress all use the similar platform WinRed for online fundraising.\n\nIn its announcement, Amazon emphasized that \u201cAlexa herself does not have opinions on politics or candidates.\u201d", "description": "Amazon said on Wednesday it will make donating to a U.S. presidential candidate as easy as turning on the lights or replenishing a household's toilet-paper stocks, via its Alexa digital assistant.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431366524&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1WX", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
