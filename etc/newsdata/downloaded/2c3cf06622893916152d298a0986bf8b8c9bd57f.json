It states I have \u00a3144.38 a week which is obviously not a full pension.\n\nIn a previous column you said that 35 years of full payments were required. I have 39 full years with four years left to contribute and seven years when not enough were contributed (working overseas).\n\nMy question is why, after 39 full years, do I not now qualify for a full pension and is it worth paying for any missed years?\n\nSCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK YOUR PENSION QUESTION\n\nState pension: Why might you not get the full amount even after paying National Insurance for more than the minimum 35 years?\n\nSteve Webb replies: The issue of why some people with 35 years (or more) of National Insurance contributions might not get a full state pension is one that comes up regularly in my postbag.\n\nSo let me explain in more detail how the new state pension is worked out, and who does (and doesn\u2019t) get a full pension.\n\nThe simplest case is young people who started work after 5 April 2016. For them, things are very simple.\n\nIf they have 35 years or more of NI contributions (or credits) they will get the full flat rate pension.\n\nIf they have fewer years, their pension will be reduced pro rata (so 34 years gives you 34/35 of the full rate and so on) and if they have under 10 years they will get nothing.\n\nSteve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below\n\nMost people, however, will have a mix of years in the system before the big changes of April 2016 and years afterwards and this makes things more complex.\n\nIn designing the new system, the Government tried to be as fair as possible to two groups.\n\n1) Those who had already built up more than the full flat rate by April 2016.\n\nIt would have been unfair to simply cut the pensions of this group to the new flat rate. The solution was to allow them to keep anything they had built up by April 2016 but not to allow them to add any further to that amount.\n\n2) Those who had one or more years \u2018contracted out\u2019 of part of the state pension scheme.\n\nThis was essentially a deal whereby workers and their firms benefited from a reduced rate of NI contributions in return for a promise by the company scheme to replace part of the state pension (something similar applied to individuals who contributed to personal pensions).\n\nIt was felt unfair that those who had periods of contributing at a reduced rate and who were set to get a pension from their company scheme as a result, should also automatically be awarded a full flat rate pension under the new rules, as if their past contracting out had never happened.\n\nAs a result, the way that the new state pension is worked out is in two stages.\n\nFirst, the Department for Work and Pensions works out two figures. The first is the amount you would have got under the old rules by April 2016.\n\nThis is basically a full basic pension for 30 years in the system plus any entitlement under the state-earnings-related pension scheme (SERPS).\n\nThe second is the amount you would get under the new rules as at April 2016, which is a full flat rate pension for 35 years minus a large deduction for past contracting out.\n\nWhichever is the higher of these two is your \u2018starting amount\u2019 for the new state pension.\n\nIf this is short of the full flat rate, any further years of contributions from 16/17 onwards add 1/35 of the full flat rate to your starting amount until you either retire or reach the maximum flat rate figure.\n\nAs you will see from this description anyone with 35 years in the system who was never contracted out will indeed get the full flat rate figure.\n\nConversely, anyone with lots of past contracting out is unlikely to have a full flat rate as at April 2016.\n\nBut the good news for them is that years of contributions from 16/17 onwards build on this starting figure and can effectively \u2018burn off\u2019 the penalty for past contracting out.\n\nIn terms of \u2018topping up\u2019 your pension through voluntary contributions, a lot depends on how much you have built up by April 2016 and which years you are looking to top up.\n\nYou should be aware that in some cases, extra years (especially those pre 16/17) may not improve your pension.\n\nYou can read more about topping up in the guide I wrote here.", "description": "I have just looked up my state pension quote.
