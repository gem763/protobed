They appear to have affected what a judge on the court called \u201ca large number of individuals, including U.S. persons.\u201d On one day in December 2017 alone, the court found, the FBI conducted 6,800 queries of the NSA databases using Social Security numbers. The government, in secret, conceded that there were \u201cfundamental misunderstandings\u201d among some FBI personnel over the standards necessary for the searches.\n\nThe redacted ruling was kept secret for a year. It represented the latest legal battle over the scope of post-9/11 mass surveillance that affects American freedoms in the name of counterterrorism. It was one of several secret court documents released Tuesday by the ODNI.\n\nJudge James Boasberg of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court found last October that elements of FBI procedures for querying the databases and then purging irrelevant results\u2013a mechanism to protect Americans\u2019 privacy\u2013\u201cinconsistent with statutory minimization requirements and the requirements of the Fourth Amendment,\u201d which protects Americans against unreasonable searches.\n\n\u201c On one day in December 2017 alone, the court found, the FBI conducted 6,800 queries of the NSA databases using Social Security numbers. \u201d\n\nAs early as March 2018, the FISA Court identified to the government that the FBI was not sufficiently documenting which of its queries were tied to people inside the United States, despite a statutory obligation to do so. Nor were the searches \u201creasonably designed\u201d to find evidence of crimes or foreign spying.\n\n\u201cWithout such documentation and in view of reported instances of non-compliance with that standard, the procedures seemed unreasonable under FISA's definition of minimization procedures\u2019 and possibly the Fourth Amendment,\u201d Boasberg wrote.\n\nBoasberg\u2019s ruling represented a rare defeat for the government before the FISA Court, and the government appealed it to the FISA Court of Review, another rarity. The appeals court sided with the lower court in July, and the FBI agreed to change its querying, documentation, and related procedures.\n\nThe subsequent changes now require the FBI to explain why searching Americans\u2019 data is necessary to find foreign-spying information or potential evidence of criminal activity, as well as to distinguish between its searches involving Americans and its searches involving foreigners. Civil libertarians questioned the ability of those changes to adequately protect American privacy.\n\n\u201cThe FBI\u2019s conduct clearly shows that giving the government warrantless access to Americans\u2019 communications will lead to fishing expeditions and abuse,\u201d said Jake Laperruque, senior counsel with the Project on Government Oversight\u2019s Constitution Project.\n\n\u201cBut the new FISA Court rules don\u2019t do enough to prevent more misconduct. The only way to do that is for Congress to pass a law closing the backdoor search loophole.\u201d\n\nThe decision highlights the persistent controversy under what is known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a constitutionally questionable law created to legalize the NSA\u2019s post-9/11 warrantless dragnets for ostensibly foreign communications. Those surveillance dragnets inevitably\u2013\u201cincidentally,\u201d in NSA\u2019s preferred terminology\u2013collect massive amounts of Americans\u2019 communications and associated records. The law currently provides the basis for massive amounts of NSA collections harvested from major tech firms, a program known as PRISM, and in transit across the internet, known as upstream collection.\n\nNSA in March 2017 stopped collecting Americans\u2019 electronic communications that merely discuss foreign surveillance targets, known as \u201cabout\u201d collection, after violating restrictions placed on the collection by the FISA Court. Yet the FISA Court ruling indicates that the government attempted arguing that \u201cabout\u201d collection was acceptable under PRISM, if not upstream collection. Boasberg rejected the argument.\n\nIn addition, the NSA, FBI, and CIA can warrantlessly search the vast Section 702 databases for information on Americans, something known as a backdoor search, something they have reported doing at least tens of thousands of times annually. Yet until a recent change, the FBI did not even record how many times it searched through the NSA databases for Americans\u2019 information.\n\nThe bureau\u2019s insufficient compliance with the new standards for documenting, tailoring, and then appropriately purging its sources is the issue at stake in Tuesday\u2019s declassifications. FBI representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEver since Edward Snowden\u2019s 2013 surveillance revelations, the security agencies and their congressional allies have fought to protect Section 702, even as they acquiesced to restrictions around the warrantless bulk collection of domestic phone records. Those restrictions, the USA FREEDOM Act, failed; the NSA deleted a trove of over half a billion domestic phone records. Yet the FREEDOM Act required the FISA Court, which had previously only ever heard from government lawyers, to appoint outside attorneys who could push back on government arguments. The rulings indicated the so-called \u201camici\u201d were a significant factor behind new restrictions on the FBI backdoor searches.\n\nCongress reauthorized Section 702 for another five years in January 2018, though this time required the FBI to document its queries. President Donald Trump incorrectly viewed it as part of his baseless conspiracy theory that Obama had him placed under surveillance, but himself signed the reauthorization into law.\n\nSenator Ron Wyden, the intelligence committee member who has sounded the loudest alarms about the backdoor-search provision, said the FISA Court ruling showed that Congress should never have accepted the FBI\u2019s assurance that it was unable to account for its backdoor searches. He also indicated the government was still hiding evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s release demonstrates how baseless the FBI\u2019s position was and highlights Congress\u2019 constitutional obligation to act independently and strengthen the checks and balances on government surveillance,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cThe information released today also reveals serious abuses in the FBI\u2019s backdoor searches, underscoring the need for the government to seek a warrant before searching through mountains of private data on Americans. Finally, I am concerned that the government has redacted information in these releases that the public deserves to know.\u201d", "description": "A year ago, the U.S.\u2019 surveillance court ruled that the FBI violated Americans\u2019 privacy by broadly sifting through dragnets of intercepted communications.", "authors": ["Spencer Ackerman", "Senior Nat L Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570564303/191008-ackerman-FBI-tease_fiwwam", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
