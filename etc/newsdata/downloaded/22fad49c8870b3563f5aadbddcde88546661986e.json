I had always been pretty healthy and did not see this coming at all,' Leisa told FEMAIL.\n\nAn underactive thyroid in a pregnant mother can cause preeclampsia (high blood pressure), anaemia (low iron), miscarriage, placental abruption (when the uterus separates early from the uterus) and postpartum bleeding.\n\nAfter Daniel was born at 34 weeks Leisa had very little fear of miscarriage and gladly welcomed her second pregnancy.\n\n'So when I got pregnant again and went for a checkup at 20 weeks to discover there was no heartbeat I felt like the the world was crumbling down on me,' she said.\n\n'I had lost my baby, my dreams of two children close in age and was concerned that I may now struggle to have children.'\n\n'I was in shock. I had always been pretty healthy and did not see this coming at all,' Leisa (pictured in hosptial) told FEMAIL\n\nWhat is Hashimoto's? Hashimoto's disease is an autoimmune disorder that can cause hypothyroidism or an underactive thyroid. With this disease, your immune system attacks your thyroid. The thyroid itself is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. Thyroid hormones control how your body uses energy, so they affect nearly every organ in your body - even the way your heart beats. Without enough thyroid hormones, many of your body\u2019s functions slow down.

I lost eight litres of blood that day and the human body only holds six or seven,' she said.\n\n'Although there was initial talk of having a family with three children, after all we have been through, we are extremely grateful for our perfect pigeon pair,' she said\n\nHer birth experiences encouraged Leisa to release a children's book called 'Daniel and the Dummy Fairy' (named after her son Daniel)\n\nWith two healthy children in tow Leisa's doctor suggested the loving family do not try for another child given the journey they have been on.\n\n'Although there was initial talk of having a family with three children, after all we have been through, we are extremely grateful for our perfect pigeon pair who are now aged six and nine and keep me on my toes every day,' she said.\n\nHer birth experiences encouraged Leisa to release a children's book called 'Daniel and the Dummy Fairy' and create the Little Kids Business Marketplace to showcase all the best in children's fashion, toys and gifts.\n\nShe hopes by sharing her story other mothers will get their thyroids checked and start treatment for possible Hashimoto's earlier in their pregnancies.\n\nHashimoto's most commonly occurs in middle-aged women, and those who have been exposed to radiation or have another autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nWhile it can be difficult to detect in its early stages it's worth seeing a doctor if you feel tired for no reason, have dry skin, a pale or puffy face and suffer from constipation.", "description": "Brisbane mother Leisa Papa was desperately wanting a brother or sister for her son Daniel but after two more pregnancies - and leaving the hospital with empty arms - she was fast losing hope.", "authors": ["Matilda Rudd For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/00/19862018-0-image-a-230_1571353747678.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
