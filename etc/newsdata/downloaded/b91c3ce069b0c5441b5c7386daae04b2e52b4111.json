(AP) \u2014 A fire raged through a boat carrying recreational scuba divers anchored near an island off the Southern California coast early Monday, leaving at least four people dead and more than two dozen missing after the gutted vessel sank.\n\nThe five-member crew all escaped by jumping off the boat. Rescuers descended on the scene but after hours of searching the water and shore none of the 33 passengers had been found alive. Four bodies were recovered within hours and all had injuries consistent with drowning, said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Kroll.\n\nThe fire broke out aboard the vessel Conception around 3 a.m. off Santa Cruz Island, part of a chain of rugged wind-swept isles that form Channel Islands National Park in the Pacific Ocean west of Los Angeles.\n\nThe Coast Guard said the vessel was believed to have carried 38 people, including the five crew, and it's not immediately clear how the fire started.\n\n\"The crew was actually already awake and on the bridge and they jumped off,\" Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said. Two suffered minor injuries, Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney said.\n\nAuthorities said the crew members were rescued by a good Samaritan vessel called The Grape Escape.\n\nThe Grape Escape's owners, Bob and Shirley Hansen, told The New York Times they were asleep when they heard pounding on the side of their 60-foot (18-meter) fishing vessel about 3:30 a.m. and discovered the frightened crew members. They had used an inflatable boat to escape and were dressed only in their underwear. They told the couple they fled when a fire grew out of control.\n\n\"When we looked out, the other boat was totally engulfed in flames, from stem to stern,\" Hansen said, estimating it was no more than 100 yards from his craft. \"I could see the fire coming through holes on the side of the boat. There were these explosions every few beats. You can't prepare yourself for that. It was horrendous.\n\n\"The fire was too big, there was absolutely nothing we could do,\" he added.\n\nHansen said he and his wife gave the crew clothes and two of them went back toward the Conception looking for survivors. Asked at a news conference if the crew tried to help others aboard, Rochester told reporters, \"I don't have any additional information.\"\n\nRochester said the 75-foot (20-meter) commercial scuba diving vessel was anchored in Platts Harbor, about 20 yards (18 meters) off the northern coast of Santa Cruz Island, when the fire ignited. She said the vessel sank in 64 feet (19.5 meters) of water; its bow was still visible above the waterline.\n\nThe Conception, based in Santa Barbara Harbor on the mainland, was on the final day of a Labor Day weekend cruise to the Channel Islands when the fire erupted. It was scheduled to return at 5 p.m. Monday.\n\n\"At 3:15 this morning the Coast Guard overheard a mayday call. The call was garbled, it was not that clear, but we were able to get some information out of it to send vessels on scene,\" Barney said.\n\nRochester said that call indicated the boat was already fully ablaze.\n\nThe Conception was chartered by Worldwide Diving Adventures, which says on its website that it has been taking divers on such expeditions since the 1970s. It was owned and operated by Truth Aquatics, a Santa Barbara-based company founded in 1974.\n\nCoast Guard records show inspections of the Conception conducted last February and in August 2018 found no deficiencies. Earlier inspections found some safety violations related to fire safety.\n\nA 2016 inspection resulted in owners replacing the heat detector in the galley and one in 2014 cited a leaky fire hose.\n\nRecords show all safety violations from the last five years were quickly addressed by the boat's owners.\n\nDave Reid, who runs an underwater camera business with his wife and who has traveled on the Conception and two other boats in Truth Aquatics' fleet, said he considered all three among the best and safest dive-boats around.\n\n\"When you see the boats they are always immaculate,\" he said. \"I wouldn't hesitate at all to go on one again. Of all the boat companies, that would be one of the ones I wouldn't think this would happen to.\"\n\nReid said divers sleep overnight in an open bunk room on the vessel's lowest deck. Coming up to the top deck to get off the boat requires navigating a narrow stairway with only one exit. If the fire was fast-moving, he said, it's very likely divers couldn't escape and the crew couldn't get to them.", "description": "A fire raged through a boat carrying recreational scuba divers anchored near an island off the Southern California coast early Monday, leaving at least four people dead and more than two dozen missing after the gutted vessel sank.
