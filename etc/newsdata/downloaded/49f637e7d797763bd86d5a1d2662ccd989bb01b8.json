But sales are down all the same because of the general atmosphere of uncertainty.\n\nAD\n\nThe usual shipments timed to reach American stores in time for Halloween and then Christmas have been diminished this year, even as Trump has delayed the next round of tariffs until after the holiday season rush.\n\n\u201cMy products are so cheap and the tariffs are so high, so there will certainly be impact,\u201d said the merchant, who did not want to her name attached to comments seen as politically sensitive in China. Some 40 percent of her business once came from sales to the United States.\n\nFrom the widget wholesalers of Yiwu, south of Shanghai, to the halls of Communist Party power in Beijing, there is consternation that the trade war has dragged on for so long, and doubt that the next battle could be a turning point.\n\nThe two sides have reached a vague cease-fire ahead of Trump\u2019s expected meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile on Nov. 16-17. Trump said Monday he expected to sign \u201ca very big portion of the China deal\u201d soon that would \u201ctake care of the farmers,\u201d but offered little other detail.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTaoran Notes, a social media account with links to the Communist Party, reported Sunday that \u201cChina and the U.S. are gradually moving closer on a position where they can take care of each other\u2019s core concerns.\u201d\n\nThe current deal offers China a reprieve from further tariff increases, imposed on $250 billion worth of products, in return for Chinese purchases of at least $40 billion in American farm products. But Trump continues to dangle the prospect of placing tariffs on the remaining $150 billion-plus worth of Chinese products, including toys, smartphones and computers, on Dec. 15.\n\nBoth sides are sending constructive signals ahead of the meeting in Chile.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you read the tea leaves of the last few weeks, it\u2019s pretty clear that the political leadership on both sides seem pretty anxious to get something done,\u201d said Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, a China-focused research consultancy.\n\nAD\n\nIn the Yiwu market, a metropolis of 75,000 stores covering a phenomenal 59 million square feet where merchants showcase their products and take orders by the thousand, vendors are also anxious for a deal.\n\nSales at the market plummeted 64 percent last year compared with 2017, to $5.1 billion, according to the market\u2019s annual report. This was largely because of the trade war, even though the market ships to diverse export destinations, including South Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe U.S. trade war is not only affecting China, it\u2019s affecting the whole world,\u201d said the slime-seller\u2019s stall mate, who was selling flower garlands and sparkly headbands. The International Monetary Fund made much the same observation in its latest world economic outlook.\n\nShe had no doubt about where to lay blame.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTrump is so changeable. The whole world knows this,\u201d she said, barely pausing to look up from her phone. \u201cEven kids know that a promise is a promise, but Trump goes back on his word and changes his mind faster than flipping pages in a book.\u201d\n\nAlthough most analysts think the Trump administration\u2019s talk of \u201cdecoupling\u201d the world\u2019s two biggest economies is unrealistic \u2014 for they are too intertwined \u2014 the president has repeatedly voiced hope that the economic pain would force China to heel.\n\nAD\n\nAfter several turbocharged decades, China\u2019s economy has matured and is now growing at about 6 percent a year, the weakest in a generation. But even those figures could be too optimistic.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow can it be possible that GDP grew by 6 percent? When I went to places to observe, research, and talk to people, the local government officials are much more frank about the fact that their regions are experiencing negative growth,\u201d Xiang Songzuo, a finance professor at People\u2019s University in Beijing, wrote in a recent commentary that was censored on the Chinese Internet.\n\n\u201cClearly, the government should acknowledge that the economy is in dire straits, face this grim economic reality, and set its mind on reform,\u201d Xiang wrote, according to a translation by the China Change website.\n\nThe Communist Party has tried to manage the slowdown, most of which is caused by domestic factors such as rising debt levels and lower consumer spending. The trade war is shaving only a few tenths of a percentage point off the growth rate, economists estimate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut that could change next year as the full effect of this tariff battle sinks in.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s economy is under pressure, and if there are more tariffs that will act as another strong head wind,\u201d said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group, the Australian bank, estimating it would take six to 12 months for the tariffs to feed through to the broader economy.\n\n\u201cThis is adding more pressure on the economy but they don\u2019t want to look like they\u2019re surrendering to Trump,\u201d Hu said.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Trump has all the advantages.\n\nExperts point out that the American president, facing a weakening economy and an impeachment inquiry, would like a deal to alleviate the trade war\u2019s effects on agricultural states as the 2020 election approaches.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think from the Chinese standpoint, it is a reasonable bet that if they come to an agreement, Trump will stick with it through the election because he just can\u2019t afford any more damage,\u201d said Kroeber, the consultant.\n\nAD\n\nIn many ways, that\u2019s a win for China because the two sides would be essentially agreeing to the deal that they brokered in April \u2014 but without the requirements for legislative changes in China, the part that triggered Beijing\u2019s objections and led to the talks\u2019 collapse\n\nDespite the impact, many in the Yiwu market are resolute.\n\n\u201cThe foreign trade business here is not good this year, obviously there has been some impact,\u201d said Chen Taoqing, who runs a toy exporting business and says there are noticeably fewer customers around now. Shipments to the United States account for about 5 percent of his sales.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nBut Chen, surrounded by toy drones and remote-control cars, said that China would not be cowed. \u201cWe have a population of more than 1 billion, we are strong,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also a widely held belief that the United States and Europe can\u2019t walk away from China. For years, as foreign business leaders have traipsed to Beijing to complain about an unfair playing field, Chinese leaders have responded with: So what? You\u2019re still going to do business here.\n\nAD\n\nThat sentiment was evident in the Christmas quarter of Yiwu. In the blocks of stores festooned with tinsel and fir trees, Shen Gan sat pouring tea among the skiing Santas and reindeer families of his Little Angels Christmas outlet.\n\n\n\nWhile daily necessities might be available in other countries, Shen said few can rival Yiwu when it comes to the Christian holiday season. Yiwu claims to produce between 60 and 70 percent of the world\u2019s Christmas decorations.\n\n\u201cThey need Christmas products in their country,\u201d he said, \u201cand most of what they need can only be bought in China.\u201d", "description": "The purveyors of Halloween and Christmas wares are hurting \u2014 and they blame President Trump.", "authors": ["Anna Fifield", "Beijing Bureau Chief."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Q1v4ZUrpb1EmSdSmP4VMPoqLS6E=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WASCSMH2NYI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
