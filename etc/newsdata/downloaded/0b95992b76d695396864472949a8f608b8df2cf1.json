Juvenile eels, known as elvers, arrive in Scottish rivers and lochs after migrating more than 3,000 miles from the Sargasso Sea. Prof Neil Gemmell, a geneticist from New Zealand\u2019s University of Otago, said: \u201cPeople love a mystery. We\u2019ve used science to add another chapter to Loch Ness\u2019 mystique.", "description": "", "authors": ["Telegraph.Co.Uk News Loch-Ness-Monster-Super-Sized-Eel-Scientists-Say-Carrying-First"], "top_image": ""}
