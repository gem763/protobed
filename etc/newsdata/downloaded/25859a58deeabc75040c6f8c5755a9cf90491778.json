(It\u2019s your body, and your choice.)\n\nLittle else is known about the new version. Though recorded in response to last year\u2019s ban, the song isn\u2019t out yet. Legend previewed it to Vanity Fair over the course of a cover story fawning over his \u201cresistance\u201d activism, among other things (it was the magazine\u2019s special\u201cimpeachment edition\u201d).\n\nAlso on rt.com Trump, John Legend and \u2018filthy-mouthed\u2019 Chrissy Teigen spar about US criminal justice reform\n\nIf comments on CNN\u2019s report were anything to go by, literally nobody asked for a remake of a song that had been played for 70 years, and was good enough for Rod Stewart and Dolly Parton; Ray Charles and Betty Carter; and Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, among others.\n\n\u201cThe entirety of human civilization is problematic when viewed through a modern lens,\u201d said one comment. \u201cLiterally none of the aspects of that song are problematic unless you twist them and make them out to be,\u201d said another.\n\nSomeone even quoted a passage from George Orwell\u2019s 1984, about how \u201cnothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the culture war madness has made it impossible to tell whether the person who said a reference to climate change \u201cwould have finished it off nicely\u201d was joking or being serious.\n\nAlso on rt.com PC gone wild: Traditions that will never be the same after 2018\n\nA lot of art created in the 1940s is considered \u2018problematic\u2019 by culture crusaders today, whether because of the ubiquitous use of tobacco, male-female relations, \u2018racism\u2019 or any number of other things. Yet it was a product of that age, and reflected the culture and customs of the time. Trying to \u2018remake\u2019 any of it to fit a world of cell phones, postmodernism and intersectionality is a recipe for disaster.\n\nYet the present-day celebrity artists insist on bowdlerizing the classics instead of creating their own fresh art, properly grounded in their \u2018woke\u2019 sensibilities \u2013 almost as if they were incapable of actually doing so.\n\nNebojsa Malic, senior writer at RT\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
