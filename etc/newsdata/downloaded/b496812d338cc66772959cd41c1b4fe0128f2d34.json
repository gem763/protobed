The 22 wounded at 15 crime scenes included three police officers and a 17-month old child, he said.\n\nGerke said a motive for the carnage was still being investigated. He declined at the time to reveal the identity of the gunman, who Gerke said was armed with an \"AR-type\" weapon when he was killed in a shootout with police. \"I am not going to give him any notoriety for what he did,\" an emotional Gerke said. \"We will provide that information to you, but not on this public stage.\"\n\nOdessa Police later identified the gunman in a Facebook post as Seth Aaron Ator, 36, of Odessa.\n\nGerke said the shooter apparently acted alone, and authorities said there appeared to be no connection to terrorism.\n\nThe assault took place one day before a series, of gun law changes in the state that ease restrictions on where Texans can carry or store firearms, from foster homes to churches. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Sunday that solutions are needed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals while securing second amendment rights.\n\n\"I have been to too many of these events,\" Abbott said. \"I am heartbroken by the crying of the people of state of Texas. I am tired of the dying.\"\n\nAn officer blocks an area of MCH Center for Heath and Wellness in Odessa, Texas, early Sunday, Sept. 1, 2019 after a shooting the day before left several people injured or dead. More\n\nThe governor read a statement from the parents of the 17-month-old child thanking everyone for their prayers. They said their daughter will have surgery Monday to remove shrapnel from her chest and fix her lip.\n\nHe mouth, the statement said, was \"pretty bad but will heal and can be fixed.\"\n\n\"Toddlers are funny because they can get shot but still want to run around and play,\" the statement said.\n\nThe shooting began Saturday afternoon when a state trooper pulled over the suspect, described by authorities as a white male in his mid-30s and driving a gold-colored car, for a traffic violation on Interstate 20 between Midland and Odessa.\n\nHe opened fire on the trooper before fleeing westbound on the interstate, shooting his way to Odessa, stealing a mail truck and continuing his assault, police said.\n\nThe suspect then shot one Odessa officer and one Midland Police Department officer before authorities returned fire and killed the suspect near a Cinergy movie theater in Odessa.\n\nDaniel Munoz, 28, came in the shooter's path as he yielded to a car getting off Interstate 20. After seeing the barrel of a rifle, Munoz said he got down before the suspect fired three shots at him. Instead of meeting a friend for a drink, he went to a hospital because glass pierced his shoulder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to turn the corner and I got shot \u2014 I\u2019m getting shot at?\u201d Munoz said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the world coming to? For real? I\u2019m just over here minding my own business, getting my own gas.\u201d\n\nDramatic eyewitness video appears to show parts of the shootout. The eyewitness video, taken by Alex Woods, appears to show the scene outside the theater from across a field.\n\n\"There's a shooting going on in Odessa,\" a man in the bed of a pickup truck says before gunshots are heard. \"Oh god, they're shooting right there,\" he says as he turns the camera toward the building.\n\nMore shots are heard, and the man tells people near him to get down. More police cars arrive, and the man says \"He's shooting them. Oh, he killed him.\" But it was not clear who was shooting.\n\nPolice initially said five people were confirmed dead and 21 injured, but later updated the death total to seven.", "description": "The death toll rose to seven after a gunman's rampage that left 22 injured following what began as a routine traffic stop in Odessa, Texas.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Brieanna J.
