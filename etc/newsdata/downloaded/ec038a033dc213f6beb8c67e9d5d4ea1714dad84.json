'To be special you need to be consistent, I've been special in Milan and Madrid.\n\n'But not all great achievements get trophies,' he continues, looking up to a newspaper snippet cutting with the headline 'United clinch second'.\n\nThat, of course, is in reference to Mourinho's controversial claim that finishing runner-ups with United in 2018 may have been his greatest success.\n\nA newspaper snippet about Manchester United finishing second is in his trophy cabinet\n\nMourinho adopts a wry smile as he is confronted by a cleaner with a laundry basket\n\nWe also get close up of a bookcase featuring novels \u2018Le Specialiste En Failure\u2019 and \u2018The Voyeur\u2019, a nod to the former Chelsea manager's famous war of words with Arsene Wenger.\n\nAs Mourinho continues to make his way through his house, which is covered which pictures of himself, he is met by a cleaner who offers him a laundry basket as we hear him say 'to be special you must respect the rules'.\n\nThe then Blues boss famously skirted a touchline suspension on the eve of the 2005 Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich by getting the Chelsea kit man to help him stow away in the basket.\n\nMourinho's 'bookcase' contains some amusing references to his rivalry with Arsene Wenger\n\nThe Portuguese is also be seen trimming a hedge in the shape of one of his infamous gestures\n\nThe advert also shows Mourinho saying 'be humble' while trimming a hedge in the shape of three fingers.\n\nIt is another parody of a comment he made as United boss, when he bragged about his three Premier League titles after a defeat by Tottenham last season.\n\nThe idea behind the commercial is that you no longer have to be special to win because the jackpot is won daily.", "description": "Jose Mourinho has poked fun at some of the more controversial moments of his storied career in a new Paddy Power advert centred around his 'Special One' nickname.", "authors": ["Spencer Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/13/18962594-0-image-a-29_1569500378987.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
