Think: tennis rackets, baseball bats and, perhaps most similar, competition swimwear \u2014 those polyurethane-based suits that were banned starting in 2010. The outcome of the current running-shoe debate could affect everything from stock prices of global footwear companies to who wins the Olympic marathon in Japan next summer.\n\nKipchoge, who became the first person to run the 26.2-mile distance in under two hours, and Kosgei, who set a women\u2019s world record, raced in a revolutionary and bizarrely tall Nike shoe that has taken the marathon world by storm since 2016. In the last 13 months alone, male runners in the Nike shoes have recorded the five fastest marathon times ever. Other running-shoe companies are struggling to catch up, and may face patent hurdles.\n\nThe current I.A.A.F. rules state only that shoes may not confer an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d and must be \u201creasonably available\u201d to all. The rule does not explain how these two values can be measured.", "description": "The people who oversee track and field have to give serious thought to how much running-shoe technology is too much.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/world/18running-print/12marathon-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
