The ruling is an attempt by Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk to silence his powerful, independent voice. Stas should be released immediately.\"\n\nUkraine's Foreign Ministry condemned what it said was Aseyev's illegal detention and \"pseudo-conviction\" and called on Russia to bring about his urgent release.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Ukraine said it was deeply concerned. \"We call on Russia and the forces it backs to immediately release him and other Ukrainians who have been unjustly detained,\" it said in a statement on social media.\n\nKiev's forces have been battling pro-Russian separatists in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine since 2014, a conflict that has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Sporadic fighting continues despite a ceasefire agreement.
