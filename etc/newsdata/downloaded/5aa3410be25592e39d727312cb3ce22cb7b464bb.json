It's a pretty interesting concept. \"Free Guy\" stars Reynolds as a bankteller, named Guy, whose bank gets robbed every day, about 17 times, in a game called Free City.\n\n\"Eventually, he realizes that that's weird and not normal,\" said director Shawn Levy. \"So, 'Free Guy' is ultimately about a guy who comes to the realization that he's a background character inside a video game.\"\n\nIt also helps that Emmy winner Jodie Comer (\"Killing Eve\") and \"Stranger Things\" fan favorite, Joe Keely star alongside Reynolds. If that isn't enough star power, \"Thor: Ragnarok\" director Taika Waitit is in the film, too. He plays the video game publisher, who serves as the film's villain.\n\nHere's how Waititi looks in the film. Kirsten Acuna/Insider, Fox\n\nThe movie is a bit of a reunion for Reynolds and Taiti who previously costarred in \"Green Lantern\" together. The two joked about that in a clip shown to Con goers that Fox released afterwards online where they refused to acknowledge their involvement in the film. Reynolds has publicly discussed the shortcomings of his previous superhero flick in the past and has poked fun at in both \"Deadpool\" and its sequel.\n\nAt the panel, Reynolds said he and Levy have been trying to collaborate for a long time before this film came along.\n\n\"We had a couple of really near misses,\" said Reynolds of how \"Free Guy\" came together. \"It's one of those great lessons where you just don't close the door.\"\n\nRyan Reynolds and \"Free Guy\" director Shawn Levy on set of the film. Kirsten Acuna/Insider, Fox\n\nA lot of photos from the movie were shown to fans during the panel featuring Reynolds, Comer, and Keely's characters. Comer and Keely star as people who play the game \"Free City.\" Inside the game, they have different avatars to represent them, reflective of people who play video games in real life. The two, essentially, have two different roles in the film.\n\nAt Thursday's panel, it was announced that Comer plays Millie while her Avatar is known as MolotovGirl.\n\n\"When we first meet Millie, she's quite defeated by the world,\" said Comer of the differences in her characters. \"Molotov is so empowered and so there's a real distinct difference in the way that they move.\"\n\nAbove are Jodie Comer's avatar, MolotovGirl, and Millie. Kirsten Acuna/Insider, Fox\n\n\"What I thought was interesting was... this kind of wish fulfillment that we live out, whether it be social media or through a video game, we create these avatars, a version of ourselves as to how we would like to be perceived,\" Comer added of the movie's connection to real life.\n\nDuring the panel, a few clips from the movie and a longer trailer, which Reynolds and the rest of the cast were seeing for the first time, were shown. The first showed Reynolds' character Guy as he started to break free from his role as a non-playable video game character and befriend a player in the game, Molotovgirl (Comer). Guy is incredibly naive about the real world and, at the time, Molotovgirl doesn't realize that Guy isn't a real person.\n\nDuring a clip, Comer's character reveals that Guy kissed her at one point. Kirsten Acuna/Insider\n\nAn extended trailer shown near the panel's end was humorous as the 20th Century Fox film poked fun at Disney, its new parent company after the Mouse House purchased them earlier this year.\n\n\"From the studio that brought you 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Aladdin,' and 'The Lion King' twice,\" the trailer started to much laughter from the crowd.\n\nThough Waititi didn't appear at the panel in person, he did appear in a video message at the very end of the movie panel to say how excited he was to be in the film.\n\n\"Free Guy\" will be in theaters July 3, 2020.", "description": "Insider was on hand as Ryan Reynolds, director Shawn Levy, and the cast of \"Free Guy\" shared clips on the upcoming Fox release centered around a video game character at NYCC.", "authors": ["Kirsten Acuna"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d96cb6fe94e865c00113d62?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
