Lorenzo Reyes delivers this weeks power rankings and biggest risers and fallers. USA TODAY\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. \u2014 If you were one of the naysayers, a prognosticator or just a plain non-believer who didn\u2019t see this particular collection of San Francisco 49ers amounting to much, Richard Sherman is speaking to you.\n\n\u201cYou want idiots to sound like idiots,\u201d Sherman said in the aftermath of a 31-3 win on Monday night. \u201cYou want them to hold that position the same year. Don\u2019t flip-flop with us. If you said we weren\u2019t going to make it, that we were some way early on, stick with that position. Hold it. Don\u2019t try to give us credit now. If you had us going 3-and-whatever, stick to your word, because I want you to sound like an idiot at the end.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s no more room on the 49ers bandwagon, even though their season is just a quarter of the way through. And there\u2019s nobody better than Sherman to make that point clear.\n\nAfter San Francisco (4-0) put a fresh layer of kick-butt on the Browns in primetime \u2013 they rushed for 275 yards, threw effectively enough, suffocated Mayfield and the Cleveland offense \u2013 Sherman, 31, was is classic form. Shoot, we haven\u2019t heard him with as much in-your-face messaging since his days with the Legion of Doom in Seattle.\n\nPlease don\u2019t stop him. He\u2019s on a roll. And so is his young team.\n\nThe last time the 49ers were 4-0? Go back, way back to 1990, when Joe Montana was in the midst of an MVP season, throwing to Jerry Rice. When Charles Haley was still a Niner, kept in check (occasionally) by his big brother, Ronnie Lott.\n\nNow this team that coach Kyle Shanahan and GM John Lynch have put together is starting to look like the grand vision, coming to life.\n\nVENGEANCE: Nick Bosa's revenge comes with trash talk for Baker Mayfield\n\nNOW THAT'S FAST: 49ers RB hits top max speed in past 2 seasons\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER: Sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox\n\n49ers cornerback Richard Sherman (25) encourages the crowd before a play against the Browns at Levi's Stadium. (Photo: Cary Edmondson, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nHey, it\u2019s early. Shanahan (whose dad, Mike, used to be a coordinator in these parts with Steve Young throwing the rock) told his squad, according to primo tight end George Kittle, \u201cAll that\u2019s guaranteed is that we can go 4-12.\u201d\n\nYou know what it\u2019s like in the NFL. What have you done lately? The 49ers are the NFC\u2019s only undefeated team, and at the moment, they are the team to chase for the No. 1 seed in the playoffs. But regardless of how passionate Sherman is, it\u2019s way premature to assume anything. Next up is a trip to L.A., where you can bet the defending NFC champion Rams will be salty.\n\nSo, the 49ers will have to prove themselves all over again in a few days. Then again and again.\n\nMaybe the question of whether the 49ers\u2019 perfect record is legit has been put to rest. They beat the Bucs, Bengals and Steelers before the Browns came calling. That\u2019s not exactly toppling the \u201985 Bears, \u201972 Dolphins or \u201966 Packers. But beating the split-personality Browns was seemingly a quality win because, well, Baker, OBJ and the crew, have had so much hype.\n\nAs well-earned and legitimate as it is, the Monday night massacre ranks even higher because it came before a primetime audience against a formidable opponent. It\u2019s good enough because the Browns were that next team on the schedule.\n\nIf you want to crown the 49ers as anything right now, call \u2018em honorary AFC North champs (sorry, Baltimore), with three of their Ws coming against teams in that division.\n\nAnd it sure is a stretch that they\u2019re in the same sentence as the 1990 squad, although this is not of their own doing. The \u201990 Niners were back-to-back defending Super Bowl champs, going for a three-peat and advancing to the NFC title game.\n\nThese 49ers are eager to establish their own identity. The blueprint looks tight. It includes some major physicality in the trenches. San Francisco has invested heavily in collecting premium talent on the D-line, including the two edge rushers \u2013 Nick Bosa and Dee Ford \u2013 added this year. Figure that Mayfield, sacked four times and battered into three turnovers, can vouch for that.\n\nThe O-line has investments paying off, too, which was reflected with the season-high rushing output. Then there\u2019s Jimmy Garoppolo, who was obtained and paid to be the efficient marquee man. So far, so good, so healthy. And with Sherman, who joined the 49ers as a free agent last year after being dumped by Seattle, brings that wise veteran presence who will speak up when needed.\n\nSherman knows. He saw the Seahawks develop from a collection of talented wannabes into a Super Bowl champ, and they had the league\u2019s best defense for five years running as it stayed in the championship hunt during that span. One of their most significant statement wins came when they upset the Patriots and Sherman got in Tom Brady\u2019s face afterward and asked, \u201cYou, mad bro?\u201d\n\nWell, the Browns aren\u2019t the Patriots. But at least the 49ers have some talent, moxie and optics to work with when it comes to statement victories. Bosa, who became the first 49er in a quarter-century to produce multiple sacks (2), a forced fumble and a fumble recovery in the same game, got a measure of revenge against Mayfield for that silly, \u201cplant the flag\u201d act that the quarterback pulled during their college days.\n\nAnd he trash-talked Mayfield in the process, which was his own \u201cYou mad, bro?\u201d moment. So, there\u2019s some in-your-face persona being developed here, too.\n\nIt will be tempting to declare the 49ers as the best team in the NFC. Tough to go that far, with the way the Saints have played without Drew Brees. Sherman\u2019s old team has a QB playing like an MVP in Russell Wilson. And the Rams are suddenly pressed to prove their mettle.\n\nAt least the 49ers are in that conversation. For now. And when you\u2019re building a championship program, the Ws \u2013 whenever, however and against whomever \u2013 provide the reason to keep believing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to be consistent,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cWhen you have a young team, it\u2019s about teaching them how to win.\u201d\n\nThe 49ers scrapped against the desperate Steelers (sans Ben Roethlisberger) and won despite committing five turnovers. On Monday night, they dominated from the start \u2013 Matt Breida ripped off an 83-yard TD run on San Francisco\u2019s first snap \u2013 and earned style points.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ve got to learn how to win these games,\u201d Sherman added, considering the showcase in primetime.\n\nDone. Now go beat a division rival. Then keep it flowing.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
