Nagpur Soybean, Soyoil, Soymeal Open- October 03, 2019 Nagpur Soybean, Soyoil, Soymeal Open-October 3, 2018 Nagpur, Oct 3 (Reuters) \u2013 Barring a fall in cottonseed oil, major edible oil prices today generally ruled flat in the Vidarbha region of Western Maharashtra in the absence of any worthwhile trading activity. Slackness in demand from millers and retailers against adequate stocks mainly pulled cottonseed oil prices down. Good hike in international edible oil prices also affected sentiment, sources said Thursday. ***** VIDARBHA MARKETS OILS * Soyabean, groundnut loose, groundnut refined, sunflower refined, linseed, rapeseed, castor and coconut KP oil ruled steady here in sluggish trading activity. * Traders expect further fall in cottonseed oil here. SOYMEAL * Soymeal prices today ruled steady here but demand was poor. Easy condition in international soymeal prices also affected sentiment. SOYABEAN * Soyabean prices declined in Nagpur Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) on poor demand from local crushing plants. Weak trend on NCDEX, easy condition in Madhya Pradesh soyabean prices and no takers to soyabean oil & soymeal also affected sentiment in limited deals. About 100 soyabean bags reported for auction in Nagpur APMC, according to sources.
