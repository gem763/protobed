BUSH COMMIT SUICIDE IN SAME WEEK\n\n\u201cThey [witnesses] speculate he was fighting with someone on the phone, but the only person he was on the phone with was me,\u201d Caraballo, 41, said Tuesday in Spanish.\n\nBalbuena scooped the couple\u2019s daughter, Ferni, up into his arms and leaped into the path of a southbound No. 4 train, horrifying dozens of commuters packing the platform of the elevated station at 8 a.m.\n\nBalbuena died, but his daughter escaped virtually unscathed, and was able to crawl along the track bed to the outstretched arm of a good Samaritan who lowered himself down to rescue her.\n\nThough she\u2019s physically fine, Ferni has yet to process the trauma of exactly what happened, asking for her dad, and believing he might still walk through the door, said Caraballo.\n\n\u201cFerni was very close to him,\u201d said Caraballo. \u201cAfter what happened, she is saying, \u2018Daddy is in the hospital. He hurt his stomach.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNow, both Ferni and her 2-year-old brother, \u00adFernandcq, will be forced to grow up without their father.\n\nCaraballo acknowledged Balbuena\u2019s long-running battle with depression, but said he was on medication, and that Monday\u2019s act was stunning.\n\n\u201cMy husband is a serious man, responsible, quiet and reserved,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was in treatment, he took his medication. We are all in shock.\u201d\n\nCaraballo said she is hopeful Ferni is young enough that the trauma won\u2019t be burned into her memory.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be a process, her living through that,\u201d she said.\n\nBut she\u2019s grateful for every day she has with Ferni after her near-death experience.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThey are calling her the miracle girl,\u201d said Caraballo. \u201cMy daughter was reborn yesterday.\u201d\n\nClick for more from the New York Post", "description": "A distraught Bronx dad said the final words \u201cWith God, with God, with God, here comes the train\u201d before jumping in front of a subway car while holding his 5-year-old daughter,\u00a0who miraculously survived, his wife revealed Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/12/Subway-NYC.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
