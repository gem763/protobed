It was a decision that was taken as consequences of what we saw in Doha,\u201d he said.\n\nCoates said he was in Tokyo \u201cto explain to her (Koike) the reasons, the detailed reasons for those changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe absolutely recognise and we are so very thankful to the people of Tokyo,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking to reporters afterwards Koike said \u201cmutual trust\u201d was indispensable for a successful Games, and said there were \u201cno plans to spend Tokyo taxpayer money for another venue\u201d.\n\nPart of the anger over the decision appears to stem from the IOC\u2019s abrupt announcement, which came without prior consultation with either Tokyo or Sapporo officials.\n\nThe marathon is generally considered one of the key events of the Olympics, with its route carefully designed to show off landmarks in the host city.\n\nIt is also one of the few opportunities for ordinary citizens to see an Olympic event for free, and is seen as an important way to drive engagement with the Games.\n\nThe proposed move has thrown up various questions, including who will bear the additional costs of the decision.\n\nKoike\u2019s party Tomin First, the biggest force in the Tokyo Assembly, estimates the venue move will cost an extra 34 billion yen ($315 million), including expenses to build temporary facilities and lay mass-media transmission lines.\n\nLocal media has said Tokyo organisers plan to demand the IOC shoulder those extra expenses.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Tokyo\u2019s governor insisted Wednesday she still wants to see the Olympic marathon held in the capital next year, despite plans to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/fce70d_tokyo-governor-yuriko-koike-plan-olympic-marathon-race-walking-events-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
