Student debaters don\u2019t deliberate about what they themselves believe, or should believe. They don\u2019t cultivate the disposition to listen to others with the real possibility of changing their minds. On the contrary, they practice listening with eagle ears for opposing points to pounce on. Rather than increasing their comfort with being wrong, they can deepen an attitude of certainty.\n\nSchool debate doesn\u2019t have to be this way, though. In fact, many schools around the country are gravitating to alternative forms of debate that set the goals of truth and understanding over the goal of persuasion. A good example is the Ethics Bowl.\n\nIn the Ethics Bowl, created at the intercollegiate level in 1993 and the high school level around 2012, a team is assigned a question \u2014 not a statement or conclusion, as in traditional debate \u2014 on a contentious topic, such as \u201cWhen is the use of military drones morally permissible?\u201d The team then presents and defends whatever conclusion its deliberation has led to. An opposing team and a panel of judges pose questions and raise potential problems, to which the first team responds.\n\nSometimes the two teams find themselves largely in agreement. When they do, the winner is the team that does the better job of articulating its reasoning, listening and responding to questions, and advancing the collective understanding of the issue at hand.\n\nBut disagreement is frequent in the Ethics Bowl, and the discussions are spirited. That\u2019s a good thing. After all, spirited dissent and disagreement are hallmarks of a healthy democracy. Disagreement among citizens is inevitable \u2014 about politics, morality, education, religion, nearly everything. What\u2019s crucial is how we disagree, and how we converse and deliberate with those with whom we disagree.\n\nIt is precisely when we disagree that it is most critical for our thinking to be clear and our dialogue to be charitable and scrupulous. But disagreement is also when we\u2019re most likely to get irritated, defensive and impatient. The more at stake in the conversation, the more difficult it is to remain poised, thoughtful, open to being wrong and ready to acknowledge fair points from the other side.\n\nDisagreeing constructively is a skill \u2014 one of the most difficult and important there is. In encouraging students to practice this skill, the Ethics Bowl fosters what may be the most important intellectual virtue of all: openness to changing your mind.", "description": "They can be a good credential for aspiring leaders, but they favor a closed-minded and partisan style of argument.", "authors": ["Jonathan Ellis", "Francesca Hovagimian"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/opinion/sunday/13ellis/13ellis-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
