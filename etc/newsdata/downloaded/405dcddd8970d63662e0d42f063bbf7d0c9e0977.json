It followed allegations within the past week of hazing at seven of the fraternities, as well as the expulsion in May of a fraternity following the alleged hazing of a freshman who died last year.\n\n\u201cThese troubling allegations, which will be thoroughly investigated, indicate a potentially escalating systemic culture\u201d within fraternity organizations, said Jenny Hall-Jones, the university\u2019s dean of students.\n\n\u201cOhio University will not put at risk the health and safety of our students,\u201d she said.\n\nIn May, the university expelled Sigma Pi fraternity for hazing, alcohol and drug use, and other student conduct code violations after the alleged hazing of 18-year-old Collin Wiant, who died in November.\n\nA lawsuit by Wiant's family alleges he died of asphyxiation after ingesting nitrous oxide provided to and forced on him by fraternity members.\n\nSigma Pi denied those allegations and said Wiant wasn't a pledge when he died. The fraternity said Wiant, from the Columbus suburb of Dublin, was removed from the pledging process weeks earlier because of a sexual-assault allegation.\n\nBut his family's attorney has argued there is evidence that Wiant remained a pledge.\n\nAt Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, a hazing allegation has led to misdemeanor charges of hazing and assault against more than a dozen fraternity members.\n\nA student reported in March that members of the Delta Tau Delta chapter at the university in Oxford hazed him during initiation.\n\nThe student said he was beaten with a spiked paddle, kicked and forced to drink lots of alcohol.\n\nOxford police confirmed that a Butler County grand jury\u2019s recent indictments of the 18 men stemmed from an investigation into hazing, the Hamilton-Middletown Journal-News reported.\n\nMiami suspended the fraternity in August for 10 to 15 years after its investigation determined violations of the school\u2019s Code of Student Conduct.\n\nDelta Tau Delta\u2019s national headquarters revoked the chapter's charter in June.\n\nUniversities nationally have struggled in recent years to curb hazing. In August in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, two former fraternity brothers served time for misdemeanor hazing in connection with the alcohol poisoning death of a Louisiana State University student in 2017.\n\nIn Virginia in April, three Virginia State University fraternity members were accused of hurting 10 students who were being hazed.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, lawmakers enacted a stricter state anti-hazing law in 2018 following the death a year earlier of 19-year-old Penn State student Tim Piazza after the consumption a large quantity of alcohol the night of a pledge bid acceptance ceremony at the Beta Theta Pi house.", "description": "Ohio University on Thursday announced it was suspending all its fraternities following allegations of widespread hazing.
