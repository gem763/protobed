The hearings will start in Mpumalanga from October 25 to 28, before moving to the Northern Cape from November 1 to 4.\n\nQuality universal healthcare\n\nThe committee previously indicated that the public engagement process would also take place over weekends to accommodate those who were unavailable during the week.\n\nThe NHI Bill seeks to achieve quality universal healthcare in South Africa and establish a National Health Insurance Fund.\n\nThe Bill also sets out the powers, function and governance structures of the fund and provides a framework for the purchase of healthcare services on behalf of users.\n\nWritten submissions must be sent to Ms Vuyokazi Majalamba and be addressed to the Portfolio Committee on Health, 3rd floor, 90 Plein Street, Cape Town 8000; e-mailed to vmajalamba@parliament.gov.za; or faxed to 086 694 3279 by the closing date.\n\nThose who make a submission should also indicate whether they would like to do a verbal presentation.\n\nCopies of the NHI Bill can be obtained from Majalamba or on Parliament's website.\n\nOUTA, who also requested an extension for written public comments, welcomed the decision.\n\n\"A 90-day period would allow for civil society organisations such as ourselves to provide submissions that are of sufficient depth and quality. This, in turn, can serve to enhance the participation process,\" said OUTA executive director Heinrich Volmink.", "description": "The public will have extra time to hand in written submissions on the National Health Insurance Bill after Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Health extended the closing date.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7499/bb92eae6cd084f85a0f1dfebdae654be.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
