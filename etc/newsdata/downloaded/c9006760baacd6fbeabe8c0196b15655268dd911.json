Our internal investigation is ongoing to determine further details. In case of concerns, adequate additional measures will be implemented in alignment with relevant Health Authorities as required,\" Novartis said in a emailed statement.\n\nRead More", "description": "Drugmaker Novartis said it is halting distribution of all ranitidine medicines made by Sandoz, a measure it called \"precautionary\" after the acid-reducing medications were found to contain an impurity.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190524110716-01-novartis-zolgensma-05-24-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
