Not a lot of men gave their names and there weren't many Thomases. But I would have to hear his voice to really recognise him.\n\n\"These things happen to other people, not to me. I felt so sad when I read his story. He has been through so much.\n\n\"If he wants to talk to me over the phone then that's absolutely fine. I'm happy to talk to him again, and I don't need any money. He should be using that to make himself more comfortable. Or doing bucket list stuff like jumping out of aeroplanes.\"\n\nLaura stopped working for Babestation around six years ago before she got married, and she is now living happily with her young family.\n\nShe said did Babestation at the time \"probably for the attention\" but now doesn't want her family to see her doing it.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n(Image: Steve Bell)\n\n\"I don't want one of the dads at school to say he saw me on Babestation,\" Laura added.\n\nThomas said he would be really pleased to speak to Laura on the phone, and the pair are looking to set something up through his lawyers.\n\n\"I still want her to have the money,\" said Thomas. \"There is no one else to leave it to.\"\n\n\"My nephews and nieces all live abroad and are doing very well. I have no children.\"\n\nUnfortunately, although Thomas' intentions for his assets are clear, he will not be able to leave his money to 'Laura' unless she can be properly identified.\n\nGraham Southorn, a legacy planner for Maplebrook Wills, said: \"For someone to receive inheritance as much information as is required to identify the beneficiary.\n\n\"The executors of a will have to be able to find the intended beneficiary - they can be held personally liable if a claim is made. So they need enough information to do that.\"", "description": "Besotted Thomas Weir, 50, from Milton Keynes, wants to track down a woman he knows as Laura Jones after speaking to her for a year on the TV sex line", "authors": ["Emma Grimshaw", "Image", "Steve Bell", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20665457.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_sb_babetv_002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
