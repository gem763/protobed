They were able to find out four distinct dating groups from grade 6th to 12th.\n\nThe data collected with the help of teacher ratings as well as students questionnaire was compared by researchers, where they were able to deduce that kids not involved in any romantic relationship had impressive social skills as well as lower depression levels than their classmates. What's more, they also performed better than the rest of the students.\n\nLead author Brooke Douglas, of the University of Georgia, said in a statement, \"In the end, school health educators, mental health professionals, and teachers should affirm social norms that support adolescents' individual freedom to decide whether to date or not, indicating that both are acceptable and healthy options.\"\n\nDon't Miss 430 SHARES 1.7 K SHARES 110 SHARES 52.2 K SHARES 129 SHARES\n\nThere was another research that was conducted this year in February, by Dr Laurice Hawkins from the University of Essex that revealed that a woman's interest in indulging in casual sex at college is linked to their romantic-activeness during their schooling years.\n\nThe research involved 45 interviews with undergrad women in the United States. In the interviews, they were asked about their opinion on sexuality during adolescence and their romantic past during school and college.\n\nThey split the test subjects in five categories -- religious, high school partiers, late bloomers relationship seekers, and career women. They discovered that late bloomers were the most reckless with their sexual partners, on the other hand women who were sexually experienced were not very concerned with their sexual partners.\n\nRawpixel\n\nAccording to Dr Hawkins, 'The late bloomers were an interesting group. They pretty much ignored sex but once they did engage in sex/hookup culture at university, they jumped into it more than others and were among the most sexually active of all the groups.\n\n'However, since they had fairly negative feelings about the appropriateness of sex, they needed a way to justify their own behaviour so they engaged in slut shaming of other women in order to make themselves feel better about their own behaviour - they might be having sex, but others were doing it more and therefore their sexual behaviour was better.", "description": "Now you've got one more reason to make your kids stay away from 'teenage-love'.
