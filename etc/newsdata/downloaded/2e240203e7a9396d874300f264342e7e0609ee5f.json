After all, losing a crewmember during a mission could be catastrophic.\n\nAnd so, with the help of NASA Flight Surgeon David Reyes and other experts at NASA's Johnson Space Center, the U.S. Army, and the University of Texas, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine medical resident Elizabeth Nowak researched and determined the optimal plan for conducting blood transfusions during extended space missions.\n\nTheir work will be published in October's edition of the journal Transfusion.\n\nTo find the best way to conduct blood transfusions in space, the researchers examined methods currently used at remote settings on Earth. One solution, utilized on battlefields, at Antarctic research stations, and even on cruise ships, seemed the most optimal. It's called a \"walking blood bank,\" which is somewhat of a euphemism \u2013 humans are literally the \"walking blood banks.\"\n\n\"The implementation of walking blood banks (WBBs) allows for direct, person-to-person transfusion of fresh whole blood. WBBs are advantageous in austere settings because participants serve as a source for blood, eliminating the need to store and refrigerate blood products,\" the authors explained.\n\nIn space, you could call them \"Floating Blood Banks.\"\n\nThe tools required would be fairly basic. The International Space Station medical kit already contains catheters, pressure bags, gauze, and syringes, amongst other necessary supplies. The only other items needed are a three-way stopcock and a blood collection bag with anticoagulant.\n\nMost preparation for a floating blood bank would come during crew selection and training. Astronauts' blood would need to be extensively screened and they would need to be taught how to carry out a transfusion. Two crewmembers with universal blood type O could serve as donors. Alternatively, all personnel could have at least one \"buddy\" matched for blood type, or everyone could be the same blood type.\n\nThe authors worked up a flow chart for activation of a floating blood bank during a mission.\n\nSteps in the activation of the floating blood bank. Likely resembles a possible algorithm for any austere environment, but with addition of mission and microgravity specific requirements.\n\nAdvanced methods for storing blood could eventually become amenable for deep space situations, the researchers say. It may one day be possible to send self-donated \"lyophilized\" (freeze dried and powdered) blood that can be reconstituted on a mission. But for now, a floating blood bank is by far the best option for extended explorations to Mars, Saturn's moon Titan, or beyond.\n\nSource: Nowak et al. \"Blood transfusion for deep space exploration.\" Transfusion.
