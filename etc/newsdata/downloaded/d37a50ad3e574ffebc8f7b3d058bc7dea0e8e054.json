Thank you!\"\n\nThe announcement followed earlier tweets in which he said he thought he \"was doing something very good for our Country\" by hosting world leaders at his Florida resort next year.\n\nTOMI LAHREN WARNS YOUNG AMERICANS TO VOTE AGAINST SOCIALISM\n\n\u201cIt is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, has tremendous ballrooms & meeting rooms, and each delegation would have its own 50 to 70 unit building,\" he tweeted.\n\nThe president followed up by saying he had offered to host the summit at no profit to himself to avoid concerns about \u201cemoluments violations.\u201d He said if it were legally permissible, he\u2019d offer to host the summit at no cost to the U.S.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers said Friday that past G7 summits have cost \"upwards of $40 million.\"\n\n\u201cBut, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nAgreeing with the president, Lahren slammed the Democrats for their \"freak out\" against the initial announcement, but applauded the president for \"folding on this particular battle.\"\n\n\"Look, the Democrats with their raging Trump Derangement Syndrome are going to freak out and lash out at this president on a minute-by-minute basis regardless, but it was probably wise of President Trump to fold on this particular battle,\" said Lahren.\n\nLahren took aim at the Democrats' fear that the president would profit off the summit, and explained the sacrifice he and his family have made in his current role.\n\n\"To assert President Trump and his family have made money off his presidency is ridiculous,\" said Lahren. \"If anything, they\u2019ve lost money, lost business deals, lost much of the brand presence they had before Donald Trump won the election and forever embittered the crybaby Left,\" she continued.\n\n\"And don\u2019t forget the damage the Trump brand has suffered all because he won the election--boycotts, removals, vandalism and more,\" Lahren added.\n\nDoubling down in her criticism, Lahren discussed Trump's background as a business mogul, and accused the Democrats of being \"jealous and bitter of his net worth.\"\n\n\"In case no one was aware of this prior to the 2016 election victory, Donald Trump is and always has been a businessman. Do the Democrats really expect him to give up all of his assets, earnings and worldly possession simply because they are jealous of his net worth and bitter over his election victory?\n\n\"Furthermore, let\u2019s not forget that President Trump donates his presidential salary,\" Lahren continued. \"Heck, socialist cheerleaders, Bernie Sanders and [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] won\u2019t do it. They won\u2019t put their money where their mouths are.\"\n\n\"At the end of the day,\" Lahren added, \"winning is what this all stems from. The daily smearing of our president and everything he does for this nation is all because the Democrats and Never Trump RINOs lost.\n\n\"They hate him because they ain\u2019t him,\" she concluded.\n\nTo see Lahren's full remarks and for more episodes of Tomi Lahren's daily commentary offering a refreshing and unfiltered perspective on issues across the country, join Fox Nation and watch \"Final Thoughts\" today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
