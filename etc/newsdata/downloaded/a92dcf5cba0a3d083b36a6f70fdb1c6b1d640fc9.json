As science and technology play increasingly more important roles in human society, the ethics involved are the concern of the whole of society.\n\nIn the science and technology field, China lacks a rigorous regulation and supervision mechanism for evaluating ethics in scientific research and technological development.\n\nThe new committee is expected to improve the scientific and technological regulations and enhance scientific and technological ethical supervision to guide all kinds of scientific and technological activities in China.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201907/31/5d40e064a310d8304553948c.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-07-31"}
