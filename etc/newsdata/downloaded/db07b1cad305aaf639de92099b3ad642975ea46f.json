Andrew Milligan/Pool via REUTERS\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday he was not willing to contemplate resigning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go to Brussels, I\u2019ll get a deal and we\u2019ll make sure we come out on October 31 - that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do,\u201d Johnson told Sky News during a visit to Scotland.\n\nWhen asked if he would resign if he could not deliver that, he said: \u201cThat is not a hypothesis I\u2019m willing to contemplate.\u201d\n\nJohnson is pushing for an election on Oct. 15, two weeks before the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU, though opposition parties say they want a no-deal Brexit ruled out before they will agree to an election date.\n\nIn a sign of how far Brexit has distorted British politics, Johnson\u2019s Conservatives expelled 21 rebels on Tuesday - including the grandson of Britain\u2019s World War Two leader Winston Churchill and two former finance ministers - for seeking to block any exit from the European Union without a deal.\n\nOn Friday, Johnson said the rebels expulsion \u201cgrieved me deeply\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese are friends of mine. I worked with them for many years. But we have to get Brexit done and we were being very clear about the risks we\u2019re running now in snarling up the process of leaving the EU in parliament,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd yes of course I am going to reach out to those colleagues and have been reaching out to them, try and find ways of building bridges but I have got to be clear - we must get Brexit done.\u201d", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday he was not willing to contemplate resigning.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426883809&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850XE", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
