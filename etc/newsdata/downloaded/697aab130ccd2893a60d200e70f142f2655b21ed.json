She\u2019s made the Wimbledon final twice and the U.S. Open final last year, falling to rising star Naomi Osaka.\n\nNow, with the top-seeded Osaka out of the U.S. Open, Williams is one win away from tying Margaret Court\u2019s Grand Slam singles titles record of 24.\n\nOn Thursday, the 8th-seeded Williams dispensed with her penultimate opponent in the Open, the fast-climbing No. 5 seed Elina Svitolina of Ukraine, 6-3, 6-1, to advance to Saturday\u2019s final.\n\nWilliams will play No. 15 seed Bianca Andreescu, who beat No. 13 seed Belinda Bencic of Switzerland in the late Thursday semifinal, for another shot at the Grand Slam titles record.\n\n\u201cIs this the best opportunity? I don\u2019t know,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI literally haven\u2019t thought about it this tournament. I\u2019ve been way more chill.\u201d\n\nWilliams won the 2017 Australian Open then took a year off to give birth to her daughter, Olympia. Williams hasn\u2019t won a Grand Slam title since coming back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to go through what I did and come back\u2014and so fast,\u201d Williams said. \u201cTo keep playing, to also not be 20 years old, yeah, I\u2019m pretty proud of myself.\u201d\n\nBy her high standards, Williams has been uneven in this Open. She thwacked Maria Sharapova 6-1, 6-1 in the first round but looked shaky in the second round, dropping the first set to unseeded Caty McNally. Then Williams blasted past No. 18 seed Qiang Wang in 44 minutes in Tuesday\u2019s quarterfinal.\n\nWilliams wasn\u2019t quite as dominant Thursday. But she tightened her focus when needed, hitting 33 winners and winning three of seven break points.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why she is who she is,\u201d Svitolina said. \u201cYou are playing in front of the best tennis player in the world. If you don\u2019t take it she just grabs it. There\u2019s no chance to take it back.\u201d\n\nSvitolina won her most recent previous matchup with Williams, in the third round of the 2016 Rio Olympics, after losing their previous four matchups. Since those Olympics, Svitolina has made a sturdy run toward the top. She reached the quarterfinals of the 2017 French Open and of the Australian in 2018 and this year.\n\nAt Wimbledon this year she reached the semifinals of a major for the first time, losing to eventual champion Simona Halep.\n\nBianca Andreescu plays Serena Williams for the U.S. Open title on Saturday.

But on Thursday she looked tentative, defensively drifting behind the baseline against Williams\u2019s booming ground strokes as Williams took control of the match.\n\nWilliams had just smashed a winner to break Svitolina in her first service game, then started the next game with a service winner.\n\n\u201cDo that again!\u201d someone in the crowd yelled. She hit an ace.\n\nWilliams followed that up by hitting a cross-court shot that Svitolina swung at and missed like a slumping shortstop. Soon after, Williams was up three games to zero.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she played amazing today, but she played a very high level at the beginning,\u201d Svitolina said.\n\nWilliams\u2019s biggest competition in challenging Court\u2019s record might be time. Andreescu, at age 19, is roughly half Williams\u2019s age. She turns 38 on Sept. 26. Andreescu played a fierce match Thursday, winning a first-set tiebreak then breaking Bencic to win the second set, 7-6(3), 7-5.\n\nAndreescu is poised beyond her years. In August, after Williams withdrew with an injury from the Rogers Cup final match against Andreescu, Williams sat courtside in tears. Andreescu hugged and comforted her, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t even get me started. I\u2019ve watched you your whole career. You\u2019re a f---ing beast.\u201d\n\nWilliams is nearly seven years older than Court was when she won her last Grand Slam title: the 1973 U.S. Open.\n\nBut Williams has made a career of jaw-dropping, logic-defying maneuvers. A nearly 38-year-old mother isn\u2019t supposed to be ushering early-20somethings off the court. But here we are.\n\nBy the second set Thursday, in the crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium, singer Queen Latifah was throwing her head back and smiling at Williams\u2019s winners. Tennis\u2019s queen is making another run.\n\nWrite to Rachel Bachman at rachel.bachman@wsj.com", "description": "Serena Williams beat Elina Svitolina 6-3, 6-1, to advance to Saturday\u2019s U.S. Open final.
