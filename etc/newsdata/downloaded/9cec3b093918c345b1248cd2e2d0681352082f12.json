(AP) - Malcolm Perry ran for four touchdowns, threw for two scores and accounted for 307 yards in offense to guide Navy to a 42-10 rout of defenseless East Carolina on Saturday.\n\nNavy scored TDs on each of its first four possessions and coasted to the finish. The Midshipmen (2-0, 1-0 American Athletic Conference) have won four straight against the Pirates, averaging 52 points per game.\n\nEast Carolina (1-2, 0-1) has lost 10 straight on the road and is 1-17 in away games since 2016.\n\nPerry carried 24 times for 156 yards and completed 5 of 7 passes for 151 yards. He is the first Navy quarterback to amass at least 150 yards both running and passing since Ricky Dobbs against Arkansas State in November 2010.\n\nPerry ran for touchdowns of 18 and 11 yards before capping an 85-yard drive with a 29-yard pass to CJ Williams for a 21-0 lead. After the Pirates temporarily interrupted the one-sided show with a field goal, Perry scored from the 6 to cap an 11-play march during which the Midshipmen converted a fourth-and-4.\n\nSlithering through the East Carolina defense with remarkable ease, Perry topped the 100-yard mark rushing before the middle of the second quarter and had 128 yards on 18 attempts by halftime.\n\nThe 5-foot-9 senior has rushed for at least 100 yards in seven of his 10 career starts at quarterback.\n\nNavy opened the second half with a 75-yard drive that lasted more than seven minutes and ended with Perry scoring from the 1. After an ECU punt, Perry immediately hit a wide-open Williams for an 80-yard TD, Navy\u2019s longest pass play since an 85-yarder by Dobbs that 2010 game against Arkansas State.\n\nAfter that throw, with the score 42-3, Perry\u2019s work was done.\n\nDefense was not the Pirates\u2019 lone shortcoming in their third game under coach Mike Houston. Unable to reach the end zone until the fourth quarter, East Carolina displayed none of the firepower it showed one week earlier in a 48-9 win over Gardner-Webb.\n\nHolton Ahlers went 11 for 23 for 138 yards and an interception.\n\nROBINSON INJURED\n\nPirates DB Davondre Robinson ran into a teammate late in the game and sustained an injury that required him to be strapped to a board and taken from the field on a cart. He flashed a thumbs up as the cart went in motion.\n\nIT\u2019S HOW YOU START\n\nNavy improved to 58-12 under coach Ken Niumatalolo when scoring first and 56-18 when scoring on its first possession. The Midshipmen are 33-40 when they don\u2019t get points on their opening series.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nEast Carolina: With a roster containing nearly 47 percent freshman, the Pirates are in the opening stage of a major rebuild. It showed in a big way in this mismatch.\n\nNavy: After stomping Holy Cross and ECU, the Midshipmen appear far better than the team that went 3-10 in 2018. The schedule gets tougher, but Perry and the offense appear up to the task.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nEast Carolina hosts William & Mary next Saturday.\n\nNavy opens the road portion of its schedule on Sept. 26 against Memphis.\n\n____\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Malcolm Perry ran for four touchdowns, threw for two scores and accounted for 307 yards in offense to guide Navy to a 42-10 rout of defenseless East Carolina on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginsburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/east_carolina_navy_football_99794_c0-260-3000-2009_s1770x1032.jpg?67369b69a8871401d07456f6875858d8325b2575", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
