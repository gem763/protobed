And with competitors like Walmart and Target focusing on delivery, Amazon has no choice but to keep spending, O'Shea says.\n\nBut, but, but: \"I see Walmart's advantage in food similarly to the way I see Amazon's online retail advantage,\" he says. \"The lead is too big.\"\n\nThe most important variable in food delivery is proximity to shoppers.\n\nWhile Amazon has a number of warehouses for Amazon Fresh and 470 Whole Foods stores to serve as potential distribution centers, Walmart has 4,700 stores.
