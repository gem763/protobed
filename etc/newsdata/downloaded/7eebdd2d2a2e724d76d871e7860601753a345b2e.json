The Baltimore Sun reported earlier this week that he didn\u2019t return to work as expected this week following an unspecified medical procedure. Cummings had previously battled health issues with his heart.\n\nCummings served as the representative for Maryland\u2019s 7th Congressional District from 1996 until his death. He was a frequent adversary of Trump and they had a high-profile clash just three months ago, after the president called Baltimore a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\u201d Trump later appeared to mock on Twitter a late-night burglary attempt at his home.\n\nCummings was among the three Democratic committee chairmen who signed a letter last month that accompanied a congressional subpoena of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has so far declined to testify in the ongoing impeachment inquiry of the president.\n\nFollowing the testimony of Special Counsel Robert Mueller in July, Cummings said: \u201cI\u2019m begging the American people to pay attention to what is going on. Because if you want to have a democracy intact for your children, and your children\u2019s children, and generations yet unborn we've got to guard this moment\u2026 this is our watch.\u201d\n\nPrior to the Trump era, he was best known for his work defending the Voting Rights Act. In an interview with Politico when he was taking the helm of the House Oversight Committee, he recalled his mother, who had recently died, and her experiences of segregated Baltimore in the 1940s.\n\n\u201cMy mother, on her dying bed, the last thing she said to me was, \u2018Do not let them take away our right to vote.\u2019 And then she died. Why? Because she had seen the pain that people had gone through to get the vote, what it meant to see for her,\u201d Cummings said in October last year.", "description": "Cummings was a leading force in the impeachment probe of President Trump at the end of a long and distinguished congressional career.", "authors": ["Jamie Ross"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_88/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571303593/RTX72KN7_ecbzsm", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
