Rebekah Vardy has categorically denied her involvement in any of the events Coleen has described.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe internet has already pretty much exploded with the gossip-laden news and even American sites offering explainers on who they both are. But we\u2019re dreaming of an epic TV adaption of the events created by Ryan Murphy and are speaking it into existence.\n\nWe\u2019ve had Feud: Betty and Joan, now it\u2019s time for Feud: Coleen and Rebekah.\n\nBut who could join the dream cast? We\u2019ve had a little think:\n\nJodie Comer as Coleen Rooney\n\nFrom Killing Eve to breaking the internet? (Picture: BACKGRID/Netflix)\n\nShe\u2019s already won all the awards playing international assassin Villanelle, and we\u2019re sensing a similar clean-up in the future for Jodie Comer\u2019s portrayal of investigative journalist extraordinaire Coleen Rooney.\n\nAs is proven today, the actress taking on this multi-faceted role must have the range to play the long-game \u2013 imagine Comer\u2019s Rooney in episode one twigging that something\u2019s up with her private Instagram before the secret is blown and she drafts up her expose in the series finale.\n\nPlus, both Comer and Rooney are Scousers, so she\u2019s already got the accent sorted.\n\nLea Michele as Rebekah Vardy\n\nEvery great heroine needs a great villain\u2026(Picture: REX/Getty)\n\nTV loves an anti-hero. Jamie Lannister. Walter White. And now\u2026Rebekah Vardy.\n\nWe\u2019re not afraid to say that the term \u2018It\u2019s\u2026\u2026..Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account\u2019 will now haunt us until our dying day, so we need an actress with an undeniable on-screen presence to bring this now mythical figure to life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho better than Lea Michele? She cut her teeth on Glee, so we know she has the acting chops for high drama. Even her role in the underrated Scream Queens teetered from an ingenue to a full-blown serial killer; so she can definitely handle the transition as Vardy goes from loving best friend to (possible) Instagram stalker and suspected seller of fake private stories to the tabloid press.\n\nNicholas Hoult as Jamie Vardy\n\nNicholas Hoult is one of our most charismatic exports as an actor, and since Jamie Vardy is one the most charismatic footballers of the past decade, we see this as a good fit.\n\nThe only question is; how will he play it?\n\nOf course, a showdown between the two husbands has to happen in the show and who better to play Wayne Rooney than\u2026.\n\nTom Hardy as Wayne Rooney\n\nPlease let this happen. Please. (Pictures: REX/Getty)\n\nIMAGINE.\n\nJust..imagine.\n\nEmma Watson as Cheryl Cole\n\nFrom Beauty and the Beast to bops, it\u2019s Emma Watson as Cheryl Cole (Picture: REX)\n\nA star of British cinema portraying British pop royalty?\n\nEmma Watson is our choice to play Cheryl Cole \u2013 a former WAG dragged back into a world she thought she escaped when one of her friends needs help.\n\nCheryl Cole, love her or hate her, is a truly magnetic presence wherever she goes, and who better to fill in for a national sweetheart than one of the most popular actresses of her generation? We\u2019re already dying to hear her attempt at that Newcastle drawl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSarah Paulson as Danielle Lloyd\n\nSarah Paulson as a WAG? Something we never thought we\u2019d see (Picture: REX)\n\nYes, this is a Ryan Murphy drama so Sarah Paulson has to turn up somewhere, and where better in such an unexpected place as Coleen\u2019s bestie?\n\nImagine the chemistry Comer and Paulson could share on the screen as Danielle and Cheryl pop over to the Rooneys for a spot of afternoon prosecco and the creation of some fake Instagram stories.\n\nJessica Lange as Victoria Beckham\n\nFrom one icon to the next \u2013 Jessica Lange as Victoria Beckham (Picture: REX)\n\nOf course, in her hour of need Coleen is going to have to seek comfort and advice from an old friend \u2013 and who better than one of the most iconic and battle-hardened WAGs in the game played by a genuine icon of stage and screen?\n\nYou know that Ryan Murphy loves a bit of stunt-casting as well, imagine the episode where Coleen, Cheryl and Danielle take an incognito visit to Victoria\u2019s flagship London store to discuss their next move?\n\nWho better to be stood in the middle of a completely empty white room, black sunglasses covering most of her face and wearing that signature icy expression than Jessica Lange?\n\nAnd before you ask, it is going to take an actress of monumental talent to accurately portray a being as multifaceted as the VB, so Lange is our one and only choice. She has the range!\n\nFeud: Coleen and Rebekha will (hopefully) come to TV soon.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
