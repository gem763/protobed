Seemingly ubiquitous species such as the red-winged blackbird are at risk. The dark-eyed junco, a type of sparrow and one of the most common sights at bird feeders, is in trouble. Even birds that humans successfully introduced to this continent\u2014such as the house sparrow and European starling, which are famed for their adaptability\u2014are in trouble. \u201cIf we can\u2019t even keep introduced species in healthy populations, that could be a stronger indicator that the environment is unhealthy,\u201d Rosenberg says. It\u2019s as if all birds are canaries, and the entire world their coal mine.\n\nRead: The least popular birds in the U.S. deserve some love\n\nAs with the passenger pigeon, abundance obscures decline. The fact that 24 million eastern meadowlarks still survive hides the fact that 74 million have gone. \u201cThere are still a lot of birds out there,\u201d Rosenberg says. \u201cIf you have a lot of birds coming to your feeder and they\u2019re reduced by 30 percent, you might not see that. This loss of abundance can be happening right under our noses.\u201d\n\nWith this great emptying of the skies, there are now 3 billion fewer beaks to snap up insects, and 3 billion fewer pairs of wings for moving nutrients, pollen, and seeds through the world. We haven\u2019t just lost birds, but all the things that birds do, \u201cas well as our connection to what is arguably one of the most widely cherished forms of wildlife on the planet,\u201d says Kristen Ruegg from Colorado State University. \u201cOur forests and backyards will continue to grow quieter with every passing year, and within that leftover space there is an opportunity for complacency about the natural world to grow.\u201d\n\nA broader pattern of \u201cbiological annihilation\u201d is coming into focus, too. A third of backboned species on land, for example, are also declining, including many that are deemed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to be of \u201cleast concern.\u201d Insects might also be in trouble, although fears of an insect apocalypse are hard to judge because there\u2019s very little long-term data on insect populations.\n\nThe opposite is true for birds, which are conspicuous, beloved, and heavily watched by both amateur enthusiasts and professional researchers. There\u2019s long-term survey data aplenty, and Rosenberg\u2019s team collected as much as it could for 529 species, covering most major groups. \u201cThe data sets they used provide probably the best long-term, large-scale information on species abundances for any group of organisms anywhere in the world,\u201d says Natalie Wright from Kenyon College. \u201cThere\u2019s always uncertainty. But if they are wrong, they are likely underestimating the magnitude of population declines.\u201d\n\nRosenberg\u2019s team also used data from a weather-radar network to show that the number of birds migrating through America\u2019s nighttime skies has fallen by 14 percent since 2007. That\u2019s important. The radar not only provides another line of evidence, independent of the more traditional surveys, but picks up species that those surveys miss, such as Arctic-breeding shorebirds. It \u201cincreases our confidence that these declines are really happening,\u201d Michel says.", "description": "Though the continent has lost 3 billion birds since 1970, those losses are hard to glean because it\u2019s the commonest species that have been hit hardest.", "authors": ["Ed Yong"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_981851532/facebook.jpg?1568918284", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
