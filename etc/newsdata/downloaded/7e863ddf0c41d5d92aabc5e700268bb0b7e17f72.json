McHugh wrote that a provision of the Controlled Substance Act did not apply to Safehouse, the Philadelphia group, in part because the nonprofit group\u2019s goal \u201cis to reduce drug use, not facilitate it.\u201d And Congress was not trying to outlaw the facilities proposed by Safehouse, Judge McHugh said, when it passed what has commonly been referred to as the act\u2019s \u201ccrack house\u201d provision in 1986.\n\nWednesday\u2019s ruling comes as health experts have increasingly proposed supervised injection sites as a way to reduce drug overdoses, which health officials said killed more than 68,000 people last year, and an average of three people a day in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Justice Department, which had sued Safehouse in February, vowed after the ruling that it would continue to try to block other cities from opening injection sites, which its lawyers have argued are illegal.", "description": "A plan to create a space where people can inject heroin and other drugs under medical supervision does not violate a federal law intended to crack down on drug houses, a federal judge ruled.", "authors": ["Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/us/02SAFEHOUSE-krasner/02SAFEHOUSE-krasner-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
