The move is seen as critical for fixing the country's tattered finances but could tip the economy, hurt by the U.S.-China trade war and weak external demand, into recession.\n\nFor April-June, Japan reported growth of 0.3% from the previous quarter. The last time Japan was in a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction, was the second half of 2015.\n\nIn recent months, the government's assessment on the coincident index was that the economy likely stopped falling.\n\nThe government will later examine the economy comprehensively with professors and economists on a panel and officially define the country's economic cycle.\n\nJapan's growth has slowed as the U.S.-China trade dispute hit the country's exports, sending big manufacturers sentiment - as measured by the Bank of Japan's tankan survey - to a six-year low in the July-September quarter.\n\nMarket expectations for more policy easing by the Bank of Japan have increased after the central bank signaled its readiness to expand stimulus as early as its Oct. 30-31 meeting.", "description": "Key Japan economic index falls, government changes view to 'worsening'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9607X_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
