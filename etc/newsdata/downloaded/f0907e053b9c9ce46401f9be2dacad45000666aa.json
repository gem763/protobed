Mr. \u00c1lvarez-D\u00edaz, 46, works with his wife, interior designer Cristina Villal\u00f3n, and their portfolio spans the U.S., Central America, South America and the Middle East.\n\nIn 2017, \u00c1lvarez-D\u00edaz was appointed by the Governor of Puerto Rico as a member of the board of directors of Invest Puerto Rico, as well as a member of the Governor\u2019s Construction and Housing Advisory Committee. In the same year, he was appointed by the U.S. Secretary of State as a liaison between the private sector and FEMA on critical infrastructure, construction and housing issues.\n\n\n\nWe caught up with Mr. \u00c1lvarez-D\u00edaz to discuss the importance of both connectivity and self-sufficiency, the best luxury spots in the Caribbean, and more.\n\nMore: Compass\u2019s \u2018Chief Evangelist\u2019 on the Importance of a Home\u2019s Context\n\nMansion Global: Describe your dream property.\n\nRicardo \u00c1lvarez-D\u00edaz: My wife and I are currently building our own dream house. For us, the location was very important. We care deeply about life in the city. It\u2019s in a walkable area of San Juan. It\u2019s close to where our kids\u2019 school is located. Most important is that it\u2019s fully Net Zero, and not connected to the water system or electric system. Our company has been working hard on issues of sustainability for years. We want to prove to the naysayers that you can do this, and be completely resilient. We\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years, an enormous number of natural disasters.\n\n\n\nBeing from Puerto Rico, I love the beach. We have a beach home that\u2019s 30 minutes away, and for me it\u2019s the best way to escape.\n\n\n\nMG: Do you have a real estate property that got away?\n\nRAD: It got away not because I wasn\u2019t able to buy it, but because I was stupid enough to sell it. We had an apartment in Miami and we sold it a couple of years back. Our kids were getting older and we weren\u2019t taking the family there that much. Looking back on it, we\u2019re a little sad we don\u2019t have it any more.\n\nWe have another one now, but that other one was the one that got away.\n\nMore: Design Firm Chief Says Luxury is About Tapping Into All the Senses\n\nMG: What does luxury mean to you?\n\nRAD: For me, it\u2019s efficient. comfortable, resilient.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s about getting rid of any chains. When you live in a hurricane-prone place, it\u2019s about having the luxury to not depend on anything else and be self-sufficient. It\u2019s a luxury to have electricity and water when no one else has it. A home should be comfortable and make your life less difficult.\n\nMG: What area do you think is the next hub for luxury properties?\n\nRAD: Places like New York and London are always going to be luxury. But the Caribbean\u2014the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, for example\u2014offers the benefits of investing in U.S. territory, with the rule of law of the U.S. and tax benefits.\n\nIn the last couple of years, we\u2019ve seen multimillion-dollar properties spring up in Condado in San Juan.\n\nFrom Penta: 'Devolved Parliament' Sets a Record for Banksy\n\nMG: What\u2019s the biggest surprise in the luxury real estate market now?\n\nRAD: Two new hubs were a complete surprise to me. Boise, Idaho, and Nashville. A lot of millennials are looking for quality of life. People from Oregon and Washington state were looking for an alternative and went to Boise. The same is true with Nashville. There\u2019s so much development in those places. Those places were a complete surprise to me.\n\nMG: Where are the best luxury homes in the world and why?\n\nRAD: For me, it\u2019s Spain. We have a family home in the North, in Asturias, and the area\u2019s very luxurious and very anonymous. People are very down to earth. I love the walkable city mentality.\n\nMG: What\u2019s your favorite part of your home?\n\nRAD: My library. I can sit, read, relax and come up with sketches and designs.\n\nMore: Luxury is About Inner Wellness, Says Los Angeles-Based Designer\n\nMG: What best describes the theme to your home and why?\n\nRAD: We\u2019re currently building it. For us, it\u2019s about simplicity and comfort. We have hectic lives with our kids and our work. We don\u2019t want to make life more difficult. For me, it\u2019s all about simplicity and efficiency.\n\nMG: What\u2019s the most valuable thing in your home?\n\nRAD: I have a growing collection of books. I have a 1787 edition of Vignola\u2019s \u201cThe Five Orders of Architecture,\u201d and a 17th-century copy of Don Quixote. When I travel, I like to go to these old antique bookstores.\n\nIn a way they\u2019re more valuable than my sketchbooks, which I\u2019d never sell, though I\u2019m not sure anyone would want to buy those anyway.\n\nMG: What\u2019s the most valuable amenity to have in a home right now?\n\nRAD: Connectivity and back-up systems. It\u2019s going to get to a point where people really value resiliency, and without connectivity you can be isolated and lost.\n\nWhen we talk to our clients, that\u2019s the first thing they ask about.\n\nMore: Designer Andre Fu Says a Home Should Reflect Its Neighborhood\n\nMG: What\u2019s your best piece of real estate advice?\n\nRAD: You\u2019ve got to be pragmatic and have an exit strategy. Today\u2019s lifestyle isn\u2019t necessarily going to be next year\u2019s. It\u2019s reckless to assume that one property is for life.\n\nExcess and customization diminishes the long-term value of property.\n\nI\u2019m one of those architects who tends to be very pragmatic.\n\nMG: What\u2019s going on in the news that will have the biggest impact on the luxury real estate market?\n\nRAD: Recessions happen about every seven years, and it has been like that since the Great Depression. We\u2019re several years overdue for a recession now. It\u2019s likely to happen sooner rather than later. In the short term, luxury properties suffer.\n\nMG: What is the best area now for investing in luxury properties?\n\nRAD: There\u2019s a difference between buying property and investing in property. You need to look to places like Phoenix, Arizona as investments.\n\nI always recommend looking at the best tax benefits, weather and amenities when it comes to investing.\n\nPlaces like Myrtle Beach, in South Carolina, and Condado and Dorado in Puerto Rico are great.\n\nMore: Italian Architect Says a Building Should Be \u2018Timeless,\u2019 and an Apartment Should be Comfortable\n\nMG: If you had a choice of living in a new development or a prime resale property, which would you choose and why?\n\nRAD: I would prefer a new development. The reason is because of convenience. I have three daughters\u201412, 10 and 9. I personally look for what a community has to offer\u2014stores, entertainment, proximity to schools.\n\nBecause we travel a lot, I like a place that has a lot of amenities. But don\u2019t get me wrong, I love a re-sale that has a historic element-\u2014townhouses in Chicago or New York or Old San Juan.\n\nMG: What area currently has the best resale value?\n\nRAD: If you focus on population increases and tax benefits, you have the best resale.\n\nClick to Read More Luxury Real Estate Professionals Share Their Insights\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Lucy Cohen Blatter"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-115410?size=1.7777777777777777&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
