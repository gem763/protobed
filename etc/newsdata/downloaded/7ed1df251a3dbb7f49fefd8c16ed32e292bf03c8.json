He is in Tokyo for the enthronement of Prince Naruhito, but stopped off at the Prince Chichibu rugby stadium to have a chat and present Owen Lane with his cap.\n\nAccording to Ken Owens, Charles did not have any particular advice to give the team before the World Cup semi-final but did offer one priceless observation on the Springboks. \u201cHe just said \u2018they\u2019re bloody big buggers, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Owens said \u201cand left it at that.\u201d Charles was wearing a lapel pin from Llandovery RFC, too. He is the patron there and, if he makes contributions like that, must be a good one too.\n\n\u201cThere were a few extra security people there,\u201d Hadleigh Parkes said. \u201cYou could tell his people had been there before and had scouted the place out.\u201d Parkes did not say whether they had spotted any photographers with long lenses peering out of the nearby windows. But then unlike England, Wales are not as worried about anybody else going snooping. Like their kicking coach, Neil Jenkins, said: \u201cThere are a lot of buildings around if people want to watch us train, I am not overly concerned.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s Stick condemns \u2018stupid\u2019 spying and is wary of Wales\u2019 kicking Read more\n\nThere was not a lot to be gained from it anyway, Jenkins added, not for a game like this one. \u201cThere is enough analysis that goes on, so you pretty much know what\u2019s coming. There might be one of two trick plays up their sleeves, or one or two slightly different things come Sunday, but mostly it\u2019s pretty simple: you know what\u2019s coming but can you stop it? And that will be the case for us and South Africa on Sunday.\u201d\n\nThere is one little snippet of information the Springboks and everyone else would like to know and that is whether Jonathan Davies will be fit to start at centre. He pulled out of the quarter-final against France at the last minute because of a knee injury. \u201cIt was a tough decision for him to make last week,\u201d said Parkes, who plays with Davies at the Scarlets. \u201cYou want to get out there and play, so you say you\u2019re OK, but for him to be able to turn around and say \u2018no, I\u2019m not actually\u2019 was pretty big of him, he was putting the team first.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Prince Charles meets the coach, Warren Gatland (left), and the captain, Alun Wyn Jones, at Wales\u2019s training camp in Tokyo. Photograph: David Davies/AP\n\nDavies is not back in full training but Jenkins is confident he will be soon. \u201cHe seems OK. He is getting back to it, so I would like to think he is going to be fit for Sunday,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cHe is a key player for us, someone we need fit, realistically. Owen Watkin did exceptionally well against France, and is a talented player but the more numbers we have, the better. We need all hands on deck to get through this match. Owen stepped up but Jon is a world-class player and you need your world-class players fit and available for selection.\u201d\n\nWhether he is wholly fit or not Davies may play anyway: \u201cThese games don\u2019t come around very often,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI think sometimes, even if your leg is hanging off, you need to strap it yourself to get yourself right.\u201d\n\nParkes has playing through a few injuries himself. He broke a bone in his hand against Georgia and damaged his shoulder against Uruguay, which is why he had a mischievous twinkle in his eye when said he is feeling \u201c99% fit\u201d. Just like Jenkins said, there is no way Parkes is missing this. \u201cIt\u2019s not very often you get to play in the semi-final of a World Cup.\u201d\n\nMichael Cheika linked with move to French Top 14 club Montpellier Read more\n\nBut he wants Davies right there with him. \u201cHe\u2019s very important both for Wales. He\u2019s a good leader within the side, in attack he\u2019s got a good voice, a hell of a fendoff, and he\u2019s a left-foot kicking option. But defence is what he\u2019s renowned for, reading plays and he\u2019s made a lot of crucial tackles.\n\n\u201cOwen Watkin stepped up really well, he is a young boy and has a big future but Foxy has been around a bit longer and I know him a little bit better because I\u2019ve played with him at club level and here at Wales.\u201d\n\nParkes tried to say the right thing, \u201cwhoever plays 13 will do a superb job\u201d but the truth is all Wales wants Davies back in that midfield. They\u2019re going to need him to deal with those South Africa backs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve some hugely talented players especially in that backline,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cBoth wingers are exceptional, Willie Le Roux has been around the block, we know how talented he is, both centres are very tough, very direct and then you\u2019ve got Handre Pollard and Faf de Klerk who are both exceptional players. And that is before you get to their pack.\u201d\n\nAnd everyone knows what to expect from them.
