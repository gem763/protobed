The teams are scheduled to play at night, but that could change. The gloomy weather forecast calls for a substantial rainstorm, potentially forcing a postponement that would likely alter pitching plans for both teams.\n\nBoth clubs intended to rely on relievers Wednesday night, but a rainout would allow them to bring back the Game 1 starters on full rest in Game 4 if it gets pushed to Thursday.\n\nYankees right-hander Masahiro Tanaka beat Zack Greinke in the opener last Saturday at Houston, improving to 5-2 with a 1.32 ERA in seven career postseason outings. Greinke is 0-2 with an 8.38 ERA in two starts in the playoffs this year.\n\nIf Game 4 is postponed, the ALCS would lose a travel day. After Friday night\u2019s game in the Bronx - if the series is still going - the teams would pack up and play Game 6 in Houston on Saturday night.\n\nREST UP\n\nThe Washington Nationals will have a week to prepare for their first World Series after sweeping St. Louis in the NLCS. Patrick Corbin, MVP Howie Kendrick and the wild-card Nats finished off the Cardinals with a 7-4 win Tuesday night.\n\nThe four-game wipeout will give Washington plenty of time to set its rotation whichever way it wants with aces Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Corbin. The World Series begins Tuesday night at either Houston or Yankee Stadium.\n\nThe last time the World Series came to the nation\u2019s capital was 1933, when the Washington Senators lost to the New York Giants in five games. The lone baseball championship for the city was in 1924, when the Senators defeated the Giants.\n\nAILING\n\nYankees slugger Giancarlo Stanton sat out Tuesday for the second consecutive game because of a strained right quadriceps. He was replaced in the lineup by center fielder Aaron Hicks, who batted ninth in his first start since Aug. 3 due to a strained flexor near his right elbow.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors Wednesday:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/aptopix_alcs_astros_yankees_baseball_22891_c0-84-2000-1250_s1200x700.jpg?27adceb4e7a3e188f844a8d005e6a1d10652b05a", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
