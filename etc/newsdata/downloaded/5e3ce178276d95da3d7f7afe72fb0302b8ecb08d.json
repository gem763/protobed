You betcha.\n\nWinx\u2019s jockey Hugh Bowman thinks the retired champion would have won the 1200m dash for cash on Saturday had she been kept in training. And her trainer Chris Waller said she could have won the Melbourne Cup (3200m) too had he prepared her for that race.\n\nBowman rode Winx to all 25 of her Group 1 wins and despite the fact she only ran over 1200m or less twice early in her career, he still thinks she would have had the speed to win Australia\u2019s best sprint.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a philosophical question but obviously she\u2019d go well in The Everest,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cIf she was trained for this race she would probably win it.\u201d\n\nStream over 50 sports live & anytime on your TV or favourite device with KAYO SPORTS.

Bowman said the jockeys will once again be able to hear the big roar from the crowd of mainly young racegoers as they head into the barriers at 4:15pm.\n\n\u201cObviously Winx has helped everyone in the industry. She\u2019s moved on to the next stage of her career and The Everest has really taken the ball and kept running,\u201d Bowman said.\n\n\u201cThe Everest is its own beast and the interest of the youth around the race is just amazing.\n\n\u201cThe racing here in NSW has gone to a new level in the past three or four years and The Everest headlines that.\u201d\n\nBowman has plenty of confidence in his Everest ride, Alizee who jumps from gate 10.\n\nShe\u2019s a Randwick specialist and loves firm ground but he doesn\u2019t want the race to pan out like it has in previous years with Redzel getting things all his own way out in front.\n\n\u201cAt the 400m I\u2019d like to be coming off the back of a horse like Yes Yes Yes or Ten Sovereigns,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI\u2019d like to be no more than four-and-a-half lengths off a horse like Redzel. If that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ll be in business.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like Santa Ana Lane to be back on my inside waiting for me to go.\u201d\n\nBowman said the five-year-old Sepoy mare was the \u201cperfect horse\u201d for The Everest and he thinks she can produce a devastating finish like the one Santa Ana Lane performed in smashing a similar field in the Group 1 TJ Smith Stakes (1200m) in the autumn.\n\nThe champion jockey has also learnt how best to ride the hulking mare who he combined with two starts ago to win the Group 2 Missile Stakes (1200m) first-up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve ridden her at this track and distance (in the Furious Stakes),\u201d Bowman said.\n\n\u201cI was moving my way through traffic and I asked her to stretch out before she was balanced.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a very big horse. She\u2019s over 600kg, so it\u2019s important that she\u2019s well and truly balanced before you ask her to move and the barrier draw will give me the opportunity to do that.\n\n\u201cI just think she\u2019s the real deal. It\u2019s a strong race but I\u2019m confident she\u2019ll make her presence felt.\u201d\n\nEverest prestige mounts\n\nThe Everest is the richest race in Australia and often promoted that way, but it\u2019s also one of the most prestigious events in just its third year.\n\nThat\u2019s the opinion of Godolphin\u2019s head trainer James Cummings who has Alizee and Trekking in Saturday\u2019s $14 million race after running third with Osborne Bulls last year.\n\nCummings said the worldwide appeal of the Randwick 1200m sprint has elevated its reputation and it\u2019s easily one of the most talked about events on the racing calendar.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not talking about it just because of the money,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cThey are talking about it also due to the status of the race and the challenge.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s pride on the line to be winning a race that is so well-known throughout the world.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the prestige of the race has grown at a rapid rate.\u201d\n\nLast year Coolmore had US Navy Flag come over from Europe to run ninth and this time it\u2019s Ten Sovereigns who adds the international flavour, which is expected to grow.\n\n\u201cNext year we\u2019re hearing about Aethero, the top horse form Hong Kong,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cEven a horse like Blue Point. He didn\u2019t come but those types of horses are winning races overseas then there\u2019s talk about The Everest.\n\n\u201cWe have the assembly of the best sprinters in the country and the inclusion this year, and last year, of an outstanding sprinter from abroad.\u201d\n\nAnd Godolphin owner Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum will have his eyes glued on the race as his two chances go around.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s passionate for his horses,\u201d Cummings said.\n\n\u201cOne thing about Godolphin is that we really stand for pushing ourselves to the limit and thinking outside the square and if this race isn\u2019t that to a tee then I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d\n\nAlizee is the team\u2019s No.1 seed and she\u2019s at attractive odds at $14 considering she loves Randwick, where five of her nine wins have come, and the absence of wet weather has helped Cummings sleep better in the lead up to the race.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important because she just hasn\u2019t handled the wet so I\u2019m happy I haven\u2019t had to talk about it this week,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cShe\u2019s a fast mare and the truth is that it\u2019s going to play a lot more into her hands than the sort of track (heavy) we had 12 months ago.\u201d\n\nSo where does Cummings want his big mare as the field hits the rise at the top of the straight?\n\n\u201cIt will depend on the pace but in a perfect worked she\u2019ll be starting to loom and look menacing at that point,\u201d he said.\n\nTrekking is Godolphin\u2019s other runner and he earned his way into the race by winning the Group 2 Schillaci Stakes at Caulfield last Saturday.\n\nThe winner of that race qualified for The Everest through the Melbourne Racing Club\u2019s slot.\n\nThe Stradbroke Handicap winner is a $26 chance and two starts back finished less than 1 \u00bd lengths off Nature Strip in the Group 1 Moir Stakes.\n\n\u201cHorses can rise to the challenge,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cWe did it with Osborne Bulls last year and we\u2019ll be looking to do the same with him. He hasn\u2019t had a quick back up before so he\u2019s got his work cut out from that perspective.\u201d", "description": "Could Winx have won The Everest?
