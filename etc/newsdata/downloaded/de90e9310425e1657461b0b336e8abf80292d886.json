Other digital tokens such as Ether and Litecoin, which dropped 9.5% and 12% respectively, slumped even more as Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg testified before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.\n\n\u201dThe main reason for this is because of the immense pressure Facebook\u2019s Libra is getting from Washington,\u201d said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. \u201cThat is basically making it much less likely that Bitcoin will go mainstream as quickly as some of its bulls think it will.\u201d\n\nPotentially adding to concern is the news that Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google has built a computer that\u2019s reached \u201cquantum supremacy,\u201d performing a computation in 200 seconds that would take the fastest supercomputers about 10,000 years. Skeptics of cryptocurrencies have noted that advances in computing could make the slower proof of work system used by Bitcoin and other tokens obsolete.\n\nAs often the case with cryptocurrencies, traders pointed to an array of potential catalysts for the sudden spike down in prices around 8:30 a.m. New York time. Among the reasons cited were liquidation of futures contracts on exchanges such as BitMex, the stablecoin Tether trading at a discount to parity and a general lack of liquidity among cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cThe fact that this is losing so much momentum so quickly is telling people that Bitcoin as a widely accepted currency is going to take longer than they were hoping,\u201d Maley said.\n\n--With assistance from Olga Kharif and Alastair Marsh.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Claire Ballentine in New York at cballentine@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeremy Herron at jherron8@bloomberg.net, Dave Liedtka, Brendan Walsh\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The hostility toward Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency appears to be weighing on the sentiment for Bitcoin.The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency dropped as much as 8.7% to $7,418 in New York, the lowest level since May.
