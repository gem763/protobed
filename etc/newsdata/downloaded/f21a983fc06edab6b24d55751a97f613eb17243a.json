Typhoon Hagibis has formed in the Western Pacific Ocean off the south coast of Japan, with forecasts suggesting it could hit the island of Kyushu this weekend.\n\nIreland face Samoa in the Kyushu city of Fukuoka on Saturday, where Joe Schmidt\u2019s men need a bonus-point victory to seal a place in the quarter-finals. But defence coach Farrell confirmed World Rugby had been in touch and that there are contingency plans in place to ensure the match goes ahead, which could even include moving venue.\n\n'You've finally seen the light': Gatland ribbed after tweaking Wales line-up Read more\n\n\u201cThe boys haven\u2019t even spoken about it \u2013 we just go from day to day, get on with our preparations,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cWorld Rugby has been in touch with us and they are as keen as we are to get this game played. I believe there\u2019s a contingency plan in place. We just get on with our day job and best prepare every single day and we\u2019ll see what comes with that. The weather forecast changes all the time anyway. So we won\u2019t probably know until 48 hours out from the game.\u201d\n\nAny games cancelled at the World Cup due to weather problems are registered as scoreless draws. That scenario would allow Scotland the chance to leapfrog Ireland into second place, should Gregor Townsend\u2019s menbeat both Russia on Wednesday and hosts Japan on Sunday.\n\nPrevious predictions of typhoons hitting Japan and disrupting the tournament have so far proved wide of the mark. Typhoon Mitag had threatened France\u2019s clash with the USA in Fukuoka last week, but the match was completed without issue.\n\nWorld Rugby is monitoring the situation and will issue further updates as the situation develops. \u201cIt is still too early to determine what, if any, impact there will be on match or training activities,\u201d said a World Rugby spokesman.\n\nWales complete their Pool D programme by tackling Uruguay next Sunday in Kumamoto, which is less than 70 miles from Fukuoka, though if Warren Gatland\u2019s team have beaten Fiji in Oita on Wednesday, they will already be through to the quarter-finals.\n\nAsked about the possibility of adverse weather later this week, the Wales head coach: \u201cThere is nothing you can do about that. I don\u2019t want to waste any negative energy on something that I can\u2019t change. We\u2019ve had some updates in the past from World Rugby about potential weather stuff and we will deal with that when it comes. We won\u2019t be thinking about that. If things change, we will deal with it at the time.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nMeanwhile, Gregor Townsend has made 14 changes to his Scotland line-up for Wednesday\u2019s crucial clash with Russia in Shizuoka.\n\nEdinburgh wing Darcy Graham is the only man to keep his place from last week\u2019s 34-0 hammering of Samoa as Townsend looks to keep his top stars fresh for Sunday\u2019s decisive final Pool A showdown with Japan.\n\nWith the Scots needing to take all five points on offer against the Bears before beating the hosts at the weekend, while also ensuring the Brave Blossoms do not outscore them on the bonus point front, Townsend has decided to take no chances by asking too many of his players to turn out twice in the space of four days.\n\nOn Tuesday, South Africa face Canada in Kobe and are expected to win comfortably. It is no surprise, therefore, that head coach, Rassie Erasmus, has made 13 changes from the team that beat Italy 49-3 on Friday. One player who has kept his place is captain Siya Kolisi who, having recovered from a knee injury that threatened to rule him out of the tournament altogether, is keen to get more minutes in his legs as the Springboks look to seal a quarter-final place from Pool B.\n\n\u201cPhysically I feel good,\u201d he said. \u201cThe form is getting better and better. I put a lot of pressure on myself, and I\u2019m always looking for work on the field and to try and do more. I just think it is better for me to keep on playing.\u201d", "description": "Andy Farrell believes World Rugby are as keen as Ireland to see Saturday\u2019s final Pool A clash with Samoa completed", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66022c918bf270b1e01e6f667d76d46f0eddbd44/1290_909_4118_2471/master/4118.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=20f38715f2977c1a3b51cc597cb6c773", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
