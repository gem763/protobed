They\u2019re taking over from millennials and bringing a different way of working with them.\n\n\u2018What we see from an organisational perspective is the need to enable mobile working,\u2019 Howard Lewis previously told Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018By 2022 mobile workers will be half the workforce,\u2019 he explains, citing a Global Mobile Workforce Forecast Update 2016-2022 report.\n\n\u2018We need to enable that trend and embrace it.\u2019\n\nIn the meantime, the company has published 7 tips on how to manage mental well-being in the workforce.", "description": "Out-of-work emails and phone calls are to blame", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SEI_70620492_1570611409.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
