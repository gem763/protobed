It involves a disputed attempt by sample collectors to take blood and urine from the three-time Olympic champion in Beijing last year.\n\nThe hearing will examine why a glass vial of Sun's blood was destroyed by his entourage, who questioned the sample team's credentials.\n\nWADA has appealed against world swim body FINA's verdict to issue just a warning to Sun. He served a three-month ban in 2014 for a positive test.", "description": "China's star swimmer Sun Yang will have his court hearing on Nov. 15 in a rare open trial to answer allegations he violated anti-doping rules.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5320519.1571069288!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/yang-sun-101419.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
