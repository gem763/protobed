To the uninitiated, a \u201chip resurfacing\u201d might sound like a convenient keyhole job in which a few bumps are smoothed out. But the truth is more drastic: this is a partial replacement in which a metal cap is placed on the top of the femur, slotting into a metal socket in the pelvis.\n\nTo remove the damaged cartilage in Murray\u2019s arthritic joint, his mighty leg muscles had to be slashed open. Only then could the hardware \u2013 which, happily, has no nerve endings and thus no feeling \u2013 be implanted. So to have rebuilt himself physically over the past nine months is testament to his patience, determination, and extraordinary tolerance for pain.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, I would sit in a chair and try to touch the ground,\u201d Murray told reporters, after the presentation ceremony in Antwerp. \u201cEvery day you chip away and you go a millimetre further.
