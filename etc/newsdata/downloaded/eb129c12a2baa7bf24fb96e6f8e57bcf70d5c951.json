Let us speculate no more. Let us spring forth, this deal held firmly in our hands and seize the victory the British people voted for.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Labour MP Hilary Benn has written a letter to Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay asking for the Government to release an impact assessment for the deal before Saturday\u2019s vote.\n\nHe faces an uphill battle to get the deal through in the extraordinary sitting of Parliament(Picture: Reuters)\n\nBut Chancellor Sajid Javid appeared to refuse the request when he said there was \u2018no need\u2019 for an impact assessment, according to Sky News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaking Saturday even more crucial, the European Parliament\u2019s chief Brexit official, Guy Verhofstadt, said the EU legislature will take its full time to carefully examine and approve any divorce deal.\n\nDriver fined \u00a3100 for parking over two bays while getting cash in empty car park\n\nHe said MEPs will only start their work once the UK Parliament has passed a fully binding Brexit deal, and if that slips past the European plenary session next week, it may have to be picked up in the session that begins on November 13.\n\nMr Johnson has urged parliamentarians to \u2018come together and get this thing done\u2019 after EU leaders approved the deal before the key summit began in Brussels on Thursday.\n\nHe appealed to those in Northern Ireland as well as across party lines in order to encourage support for the deal.\n\nHe said: \u2018I am very confident that when my colleagues in Parliament study this agreement that they will want to vote for it on Saturday and in succeeding days.\u2019\n\nHe appealed to those in Northern Ireland as well as across party lines in order to encourage support for the deal (Picture: EPA)\n\nAppealing to Arlene Foster\u2019s DUP, he insisted the country can leave the bloc \u2018as one United Kingdom\u2019 and \u2018decide our future together\u2019.\n\nEU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker piled the pressure on MPs to back the deal in the parliamentary showdown by raising doubts over any further delay to the UK\u2019s departure past October 31.\n\nMum's anger as both sons are banned from playground because of haircuts\n\nThe Daily Telegraph reported that between 10 and 15 Labour MPs are prepared to back the deal to avoid a no-deal scenario, and the same newspaper said it learned that Mr Juncker agreed to play down the possibility of an extension after asking Mr Johnson what would help to get the support of MPs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut European Council President Donald Tusk said if there is a request for an extension he will \u2018consult with other member states to see how they react\u2019.\n\nFollowing days of intense negotiations, the PM announced that he had struck a \u2018great new deal\u2019 shortly before heading to the Brussels meeting.\n\nBut it must still be passed by a Parliament which has so far proved hostile to both Brexit and Mr Johnson.\n\nFollowing days of intense negotiations, the PM announced that he had struck a \u2018great new deal\u2019 (Picture: Getty)\n\nOn Thursday, MPs approved a motion to hold the first weekend sitting of Parliament since the Falklands conflict, and if Parliament does not vote for the agreement on Saturday, Mr Johnson faces an almighty clash over whether he will request a further Brexit delay from Brussels as he is compelled to under the Benn Act.\n\nMan killed girlfriend, phoned his mum and said 'she's done my head in'\n\nThe stance of the DUP is particularly important because the party wields influence over some hardline Tory Brexiteers and Mr Johnson is far short of a majority in Parliament.\n\nIn an attempt to persuade the doubters, Commons leader and former ERG chair Jacob Rees-Mogg said he thought the deal is \u2018a triumph of negotiating\u2019.\n\nA total of 635 votes will be in play when the deal is debated, which means the Government will need at least 318 votes to be certain of a majority.\n\nIf every Conservative MP who is able to vote also backs the deal, this gives the Government 285 votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Johnson did not rule out suspending the whip from Tories who rebelled on Saturday, or say whether he would welcome back the 21 he exiled for previously voting against his will.\n\nMr Johnson also has the backing of former Prime Minister David Cameron, who said he would back the deal if he were still an MP.\n\nSpeaking at Harrogate\u2019s Crown Hotel on the first night of the town\u2019s literature festival, Mr Cameron said: \u2018I think it\u2019s much better to leave with a deal, and I think Boris has done well to achieve that deal. I hope he\u2019ll get it through parliament, I suspect he will but it will be tight.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
