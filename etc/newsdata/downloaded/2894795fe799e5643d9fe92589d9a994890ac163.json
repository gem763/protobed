But when it comes to this quarter\u2019s money data, I don\u2019t even have to do that. Historical data suggests that polling is a much more accurate indicator of where the race is going than third-quarter fundraising in the year before the primaries. And, so far, there aren\u2019t many surprises in the data that need to be explained away. Warren raised tons of money as she surged. Joe Biden, who shares the title of front-runner with Warren, posted worse numbers. Sanders and Buttigieg, both talented fundraisers in the second-to-third tier, raked in the cash. And dark horses such as Booker managed to stay afloat. Aside from Andrew Yang\u2019s solid haul, fundraising didn\u2019t tell you anything you didn\u2019t already know.\n\nI used some simple, back-of-the-envelope stats to get a handle on how much fundraising usually helps us predict primary results* \u2014 and I found that, once you\u2019ve taken polling data into account, third-quarter fundraising data doesn\u2019t provide us with any extra insights into who is going to win. This isn\u2019t a definitive, conversation-ending finding: this sort of math involves complex choices about what variables to use, how to pick out the most important pieces from the avalanche of data from the FEC and how to average polls. Other analysts might slice the data another way and come to somewhat different conclusions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut my math does match common sense. Polling is simply a more direct measure of support for a candidate than fundraising data.\n\nA candidate who has a dedicated but small base of support, such as Ron Paul did during the 2008 Republican primary, can raise a boatload of money while still having basically no chance of winning the nomination. While his supporters are willing and able to give substantial amounts of money, there still aren\u2019t an overwhelming number of them. And serious candidates can lag in early fundraising. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign organization was lackluster and his fundraising was uninspiring at this point during the 2016 campaign, and he\u2019s the president now. Primary money isn\u2019t completely decoupled from electoral success \u2014 Mitt Romney raised a lot in 2011 and Lincoln Chafee raised very little in 2015 \u2014 but as a general rule, good polling has been a more reliable sign of success than good fundraising.\n\nSo if you want to get a good read of where the horse race is now and where it might be going, take polling more seriously than cash. Sanders had a genuinely solid quarter in the money race, but that hasn\u2019t translated to a growth in real support. He\u2019s still stuck under 20 percent in national polls with no apparent, viable plan to expand. Biden didn\u2019t have an amazing fundraising quarter, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from maintaining his base and staying near the top in the polls. Warren jumped to second place in the money race this quarter, but anyone who is watching the survey data already knows she\u2019s gaining \u2014 over the past few months she\u2019s gone from second-to-third tier candidate to essentially tied with Biden for the top-spot nationally. No one should seriously revise their view of any of the major candidates based on their fundraising haul.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe only truly interesting data point from the latest batch of fundraising figures was Andrew Yang\u2019s haul of more than $10 million. Yang has always been a long shot for the nomination, and this influx of cash doesn\u2019t change that fact. But, as others have noted, it makes him look more like the Ron Paul of this cycle: someone with a signature idea (universal basic income for Yang, the gold standard for Paul), an uncommon political outlook (libertarianism for Paul, postliberalism for Yang), a devoted base of oddball followers, and the ability to rake in surprising amounts of cash.\n\nPaul obviously never won the Republican nomination and the GOP never had a libertarian moment. But Paul\u2019s dovishness and penchant for conspiracy theories became part of the GOP mainstream as Trump ascended to the nomination and the White House. Yang\u2019s fundraising numbers suggest that some part of his approach and platform resonated deeply within a segment of the Democratic Party. So even if Yang loses, which he almost assuredly will, Yang-ism may survive to exert an unexpected influence in the future.\n\n* i.e., regression analysis using the percentage of all individual contributions each candidate received and a three-month polling average to predict final primary vote share.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Third-quarter fundraising data doesn't tell us much about who is going to win.", "authors": ["David Byler", "Data Analyst", "Political Columnist Focusing On Elections", "Polling", "Demographics", "Political Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/82ij85o8BiRN6eQQpoEtSJwnrgQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TLVYRIXFPUI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
