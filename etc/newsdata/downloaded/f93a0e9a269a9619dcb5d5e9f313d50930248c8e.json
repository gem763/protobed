It comes as no surprise whatsover that he is being touted as the man to turn around an ailing Manchester United.\n\nMAX ALLEGRI'S MANAGERIAL CV 2003\u20132004: Aglianese 2004\u20132005: SPAL 2005\u20132006: Grosseto 2007\u20132008: Sassuolo 2008\u20132010: Cagliari 2010\u20132014: AC Milan 2014\u20132019: Juventus\n\n'Allegri is the best possible option for United,' legendary Italian Luciano Moggi told Sportsmail. 'With all due respect to Moyes and Solskjaer, Allegri is better than both.\n\n'He will bring United back to winning the championship and competing against Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Liverpool.\n\n'I'm sure that in two years, United would be triumphant in the Premier League with him on the bench.'\n\nTo the ears of anguished Manchester United supporters, the noises coming from Italy about one of the finest managers in the last decade are hitting all the right notes.\n\nRight now, they could not be further away from lifting the league title. Lose to Liverpool on Sunday and United would be 18 points adrift of their bitter rivals.\n\nThe issues at United lie deeper than the man in the hot-seat. David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer. They are without a director of football and lack a clear philosophy - something an experienced Allegri would help resolve.\n\nAllegri has been learning English and has long looked set to manage in the Premier League\n\nLuciano Moggi believes that Allegri would win Manchester United the league title in two years\n\nMoreno Torricelli, man of the match for Juventus when they last won the Champions League in 1996, has very clear ideas about how the former Bianconeri boss would transform United.\n\n'It will take time to get the club back to other levels but Allegri will succeed and in three years he will be King of Europe,' Torricelli said.\n\n'I am happy that United is becoming more and more 'Juventino'.'\n\nAllegri and his coaching staff are still being paid by Juventus until the the 52-year-old takes his next challenge.\n\nHe is learning English, a motivation he has held since his days as a player at Cagliari in the late 90s, and all is pointing towards a move to England - that is the feeling in Italy, at least.\n\nBut while he has experience with Juventus and learning English, Torricelli feels the guidance of Patrice Evra and Edwin van der Sar, both former Juventus but crucially, both with a deep-rooted understanding of United, would prove invaluable.\n\n'Allegri is perfect for English football,' he added. 'I don't know what his knowledge of English is. I think Evra can help him a lot.\n\nEvra watched Tottenham's Champions League defeat vs Bayern Munich alongside Allegri\n\nEdwin van der Sar could also serve as part of the Allegri set-up to help scout young talents\n\n'It is said that Van der Sar may also return to Manchester along with Evra. It would be a great purchase, in my opinion.\n\n'I met and played against him and he was a phenomenal goalkeeper who today is an exceptional manager behind the scenes. He could grow the new (Matthjis) De Ligt and (Frenkie) de Jong in Manchester.'\n\nVan der Sar is hailed as a talent spotter given it was the work of the side he helped build at Ajax that saw Allegri's final Champions League campaign at Juventus end prematurely last season.\n\nOn Evra, since the pair were seen watching matches together on social media recently, talk of a reunion at Old Trafford is unrelenting.\n\nThe Frenchman, working as one of Allegri's assistants, would be tasked with managing the dressing room, helping Allegri with his English. With Evra on board, the pragmatic Allegri would be guaranteeing the presence of a man with great charisma as well as a representative of the club's successful past.\n\nFormer Manchester United captain is attending the coaching course. In recent weeks he has intensified the exchange of tweets and photos to remind all his followers of his great love for United and the desire to return to being useful for the 'Red Devils'.\n\nAllegri's staff would also include Marco Landucci, Allegri's inseparable friend and ally, Maurizio Trombetta and Aldo Dolcetti.\n\nHe is a pragmatic coach and would help give United an identity for a particularly young side\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has suffered a disastrous start to the season and could soon be sacked\n\nThe idea would be to keep the band who brought unprecedented success season after season to Juventus - except for Andrea Pertusio who left Turin for a new role - in a bid to replicate in M16.\n\nThe Premier League has seen a wealth of Italian managers arrive and succeed from Claudio Ranieri at Leicester to Antonio Conte, Roberto Di Matteo and Carlo Ancelotti at Chelsea.\n\nShould he make the move to Old Trafford this season, Allegri would become the highest paid Italian coach in the history of the division.\n\nHe would come at a sizeable price but for Silvano Martina, the agent of legendary goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, he is worth his weight in gold.\n\n'I think so highly of Massimiliano Allegri,' she told Sportsmail. 'I have had different experiences as an agent in England and Max is perfect for the Premier League.\n\n'Manchester is the perfect city for him. He coached Juventus, AC Milan and has won everywhere he goes. In Italy it is said: 'after two comes three'. Now he can win in Manchester with United and announce himself as the new King of England.\n\n'Allegri would have been the best choice after (Sir Alex) Ferguson. He would win in every competition he enters and with any team he has because he is intelligent.'\n\nEven since departing Juventus, unable to end their barren run without the Champions League, praise of him and his accolades has remained.\n\nEvra won five Premier League titles and one Champions League during his time at United\n\nMarcelo Lippi, himself a former boss in Turin, believes that 'anybody who criticises Allegri is crazy' given his incredible record, particularly domestically.\n\nThere are those that feel Allegri inherited a Juventus side, created by Antonio Conte, that had won three successive league titles.\n\nIt is easy to walk into a club used to winning, some critics thought, but 'winning is not easy' and Allegri's honours must be respected, according to former England and Juventus boss Fabio Capello.\n\n'In Italy he was too criticised at times,' he said. 'How do you criticise a coach who wins every year? Winning is not easy. It's very difficult'.\n\nShould he take over from Solskjaer in the coming weeks or months, he would arrive in a situation in stark contrast to what he arrived on his first day at Juventus. United are low on quality and confidence but also lack an identity that was an integral part of life under Ferguson.\n\nBut if the mood in Italy is anything to go by, Allegri is the only man for the job.", "description": "ALVISE CAGNAZZO IN ITALY: One thing Italian football fans had to get used to pretty quickly was that wherever he goes, Max Allegri wins and that is what United have struggled to do of late.", "authors": ["Alvise Cagnazzo", "Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/15/19887614-0-image-a-23_1571408698655.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
