When you get players in, you need the right ones that are going to stay here for a longer period and that's the long-term thinking we have to show.\n\n\"I cannot think, 'I need a player because this is my reputation'. No, it's the club. There were strikers [available in the off-season], but they weren't the ones we wanted. We couldn't get the one we wanted.\"\n\nWhile United have struggled, Lukaku has flourished since his club-record move to Inter, where the Belgian star has scored three goals to lead Antonio Conte's men to six wins from as many Serie A fixtures.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolskjaer added: \"It was time for Rom to go. He knows that. He didn't want to be here. What is the point in having players that don't want to be here?\n\n\"We need to score more goals, definitely, and that's what I've said here. We're working on improving relationships, the patterns, the understanding and we've started in one end with the foundation, we've done great defensively, but we're not happy with the return going forward.\n\n\"You wouldn't mind scoring a few goals on set-plays and from midfield, of course. I think the forwards are always going to give us goals, so of course, we both expect and hope they're going to come.\"", "description": "After losing Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez, Manchester United are eyeing attacking reinforcements.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EBSs3YACBL3nZvl_aDOItw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/z3KXMj9eqNTfL3GEqTykgA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/3232375f0215b22775d0b98522a86f13", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
