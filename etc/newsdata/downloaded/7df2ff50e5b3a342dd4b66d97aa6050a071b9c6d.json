The article about the interview added at the time, \u201cHe declined to say what those ideas are despite several requests to do so.\u201d\n\nSix months later, the Republican president declared with pride, \u201cWe\u2019re not going into Syria.\u201d It was problematic for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was the fact that the United States already had troops in Syria.\n\nIn late 2018, Trump ignored his team and announced a precipitous withdrawal of all U.S. troops, assuring Americans that \u201cour boys, our young women, our men, they\u2019re all coming back.\u201d The president quietly abandoned that commitment soon after.\n\nAll of which helped set the stage for yesterday, when we were reminded anew that the president is a slow learner. Trump boasted to reporters yesterday afternoon, \u201cLook, we have no soldiers in Syria. We\u2019ve won\u2026. We have no soldiers.\u201d He echoed the rhetoric at a campaign rally in Minneapolis last night, telling supporters he decided to bring Americans troops \u201cback home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any soldiers there because we left, we won, we left, take a victory United States,\u201d he said. \u201cBring our troops back home.\u201d [\u2026] \u201cIt\u2019s time to bring them home, we\u2019ve done our job,\u201d he added.\n\nWhat amazed me wasn\u2019t just Trump\u2019s willingness to make demonstrably false claims, but also his apparent unfamiliarity with the most basic elements of his own policy.\n\nWhether he understands this or not, Trump hasn\u2019t ordered the withdrawal of U.S. servicemen and women from Syria. Rather, the American president moved a modest number of troops in order to allow Turkey to launch an offensive against our Kurdish allies.\n\nThe U.S. troops are still in Syria. He hasn\u2019t brought them \u201chome.\u201d As Daniel Dale added yesterday, the United States still has about 1,000 soldiers in Syria, and that figure isn\u2019t poised to change.\n\nJonathan Hoffman, chief Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement on Tuesday: \u201cWe have made no changes to our force presence in Syria at this time.\u201d Less than an hour after Trump made his Thursday claim that there are \u201cno soldiers in Syria,\u201d a senior State Department official told reporters that the US military mission in Syria is ongoing. \u201cWe had and still have a significant military mission there to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS, also to maintain the stability of northeast Syria and the region given our other critical missions in the Near East,\u201d the official said on a conference call conducted on condition of anonymity.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the question: when Trump says he\u2019s bringing the troops home, and that the United States has \u201cno soldiers in Syria,\u201d is he lying or is he genuinely confused about his own policy?", "description": "When Trump says the United States has \"no soldiers in Syria,\" is he lying or is he genuinely confused about his own policy?", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_tur_syria_191010_1920x1080.jpg?itok=1esKhwTj", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
