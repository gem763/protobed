After it reviewed its rules last month, it said it would allow only its own employees to carry out the work from then on.", "description": "The company acknowledges it had not been clear enough that humans might listen to users' recordings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16FBD/production/_108914149_fdf877bf-3d0d-4d9e-89ec-7b3bb015967f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
