If he loved her, give her back up to us so I can bury my daughter.\n\n'If I get to see her before I die I'll be very grateful.'\n\nIsrael, whose birth name is Ajibola Shogbamimu, and Miss Morgan spent time alone together, against strict church rules, and he murdered her.\n\nHe then tried to cover his tracks by removing her number from a church Telegram group chat and even kept up the pretence by going to her student house share under the guise of checking on her in the days after she apparently went missing.\n\nShohfah-El Israel, 40, right, received a life sentence with a minimum of 17-years for the murder of Joy Morgan (left) but he has never revealed where her body is\n\nA police spokeswoman said the identity of the body had not yet been confirmed\n\nThe pair met at Israel United in Christ (IUIC), which has since been described by the victim's family as a 'cult'.\n\nMiss Morgan formed a close bond with the married 40-year-old, from Cricklewood, north-west London.\n\nShe was last seen on December 26 getting into a car with him and his wife Chindu.\n\nJoy's mother Carol claims that the church encouraged its followers to divide people by colour.\n\nAfter joining the UK sect of the group based in Ilford, East London, the 20-year-old's family say there was a dramatic change in her character.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Carol said: 'I blatantly called my daughter racist. The moment she started getting more and more into the church it was unbearable.\n\nIsrael, whose birth name is Ajibola Shogbamimu, and Miss Morgan spent time alone together, against strict church rules, and he murdered her\n\n'In the house we were 'dirty people' because we were not converted to the faith. That means we were sinners.\n\n'She would make you feel like you were diseased. That's how bad it was.\n\n'She would come into the house and if I had a vest top on, she'd say 'Mum you need to cover yourself up, you need to take off your shoes''.\n\nShe explained her behaviour reached boiling point when she referred to her mixed-race sister as a 'white devil'.\n\nShe said: 'She was, bit by bit, wanting to change us but at the same time white people were devils.\n\n'The moment she called my mixed-race daughter a demon because she is mixed-race I said: 'No'.\n\n'I took the laptop away and that's when things got to the point of arguments and she left. She went homeless.'\n\nJoy's sister Dionne, 34, said: 'The teaching of the church, it just seems like a cult and she just got swept away in it.'\n\nJoy was last seen on December 26 getting into this car with Israel and his wife Chindu\n\nCarol had phoned her daughter on Boxing Day 2018 in the hope that she would join her family to celebrate Christmas but this was forbidden by the church.\n\nInstead, the midwifery student spent the day with the group at the church, which was the last time she was seen.\n\nBut the religious group, that has a congregation of around 150 members, did not report her missing when she failed to turn up in the following weeks.\n\nIt wasn't until six weeks later, when Joy's mother received a call from her estate agent saying that she had not been paying her rent that she was reported missing.\n\nOutside court during the murder trial in August 2019, Carol confronted some IUIC members and asked: 'Why did none of you phone the local authorities, the police, the 999 services?\n\n'That's the thing that gets me. Isn't that a Christian thing to do? A real Christian thing. To care about another human being enough to call the police.'\n\nIUIC denies that it is a hate group and says 'at no point do we teach against the laws of the land or authorities.'", "description": "Human remains have been found in woodlands near Stevenage, Hertfordshire, and police are determining whether they are those of Joy Morgan, 20, who was murdered by Shofah-El Israel, 40.", "authors": ["Joel Adams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/10/19388350-0-image-a-9_1570441445453.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
