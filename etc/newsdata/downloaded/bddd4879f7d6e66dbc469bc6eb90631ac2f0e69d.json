The warehouse is the first of its kind to open in the U.S. with multiple floors that large delivery trucks can access by ramps, property analysts say.\n\nAmazon is taking about 500,000 square feet, and the Home Depot Inc. has plans to take almost 100,000 square feet, according to a person familiar with the project.\n\nThe Prologis Georgetown Crossroads is the first industrial warehouse of its kind in the U.S., allowing trucks to drive up ramps and dock on the second floor.

To do so in dense urban centers, having distribution facilities close to the customers, rather than in more distant suburban locations, is critical.\n\n\u201cYou have to go vertical because you can\u2019t find a 50-acre space in the middle of a city close to the customer,\u201d said Hamid Moghadam, Prologis \u2019s chief executive. Prologis, one of the world\u2019s largest owners of warehouse space, developed and owns the Seattle building.\n\nFreight elevators capable of carrying forklifts and a ramp that enables trucks to drive right up to loading docks on the second floor help speed up delivery.\n\nPrologis Georgetown Crossroads, as shown in this rendering, includes freight elevators with forklift access exclusively serving the third floor.

Bridge Development Partners LLC and DH Property are planning a four-story warehouse in Brooklyn.\n\nOnline retailers in New York City are looking for more than 9 million square feet of warehouse space, but there is only about 5 million square feet under construction, said Rob Kossar, a vice chairman at JLL.\n\n\u201cIf you need to do same-day delivery in Brooklyn, Queens and downtown Manhattan, you have to be in the city,\u201d Mr. Kossar said.\n\nTarget\u2019s strategy, however, has relied on the use of its stores as distribution hubs to get close to its online shoppers and speed up deliveries rather than investing in new warehouse fulfillment centers.\n\nThe Seattle building\u2019s first two floors are like warehouses stacked on top of each other, connected by a ramp to loading docks and a staging area that can accommodate large trucks. Its third floor, designed for offices and light manufacturing, is accessible by freight and passenger elevators.\n\nDevelopers are eager to build multistory warehouses because they can charge a rent premium. Asking rents at the Seattle project ranged from 15% to 30% above prices for older, less functional single-story warehouses in the area, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAs the decline of brick and mortar retail rolls on, commercial real estate developers are left with massive abandoned properties. Who will fill that underutilized space? A series of recent acquisitions by associates of Amazon in Northeastern Ohio provides some clues.\n\nYet developers and analysts say tenants may still have lower overall costs because facilities closer to the customer could mean lower labor and transportation expenses, which usually dwarf real-estate costs.\n\nStill, multistory warehouses have taken longer to catch on in the U.S. because they also present new risks.\n\nLand and construction costs for a structure to support large, heavy truck loads are often double that of single-story warehouses. The cost for the Prologis project was about $260 a square foot including land, compared with about $125 a square foot for a single-story warehouse in other Seattle industrial neighborhoods, the company said. However, prices in the same neighborhood could run to $230 a square foot, Prologis said.\n\nReal-estate firms have had to move forward with these expensive projects without first securing a tenant. Now, analysts say, Amazon\u2019s lease is a big vote of confidence for this type of warehouse design.\n\n\u201cDevelopers don\u2019t have to answer the question anymore of why Seattle [the Prologis warehouse] is not leased,\u201d Mr. Kossar said. In New York City, the format is even more compelling than Seattle \u201cbecause of the extraordinary undersupply of land,\u201d he said.\n\nBut for some real-estate investors, Amazon\u2019s blessing is not enough. They want to see that these properties can trade through a secondary market.\n\n\u201cFrom the developer and speculator standpoint, what\u2019s the exit?\u201d asked Walter Byrd, executive managing director at real-estate services firm Transwestern. \u201cSelling it to the secondary market as an investment, that is the big hurdle to prove that the investment capital is attracted to it.\u201d\n\nPrologis, which has 786 million square feet of industrial buildings world-wide, has multiple-story warehouses abroad\u2014many over four stories\u2014in places such as China, Singapore and Japan where the land in cities is scarce and therefore pricey.\n\nThree years ago, the company began planning its Seattle project, deciding that conditions there and in cities including San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles were ripe for vertical warehouses.\n\nLand costs in these cities are high, and retailers have expanded same-day, two-hour and one-hour delivery services there, requiring shipping locations much closer to the customer than before. Nationally, vacancy rates have dropped, and rents have continued to rise, giving developers incentive to build.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Would you support your city hosting an Amazon warehouse if it could reduce wait times on deliveries? Join the conversation below.\n\nVacancy rates in the U.S. have fallen from 7.2% in the second quarter of 2014 to 5% in the same period this year, while asking rents have risen 31% to $5.86 a square foot in the same time, according to JLL.\n\nWrite to Keiko Morris at Keiko.Morris@wsj.com and Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com", "description": "Amazon.com\u2019s new type of fulfillment center could reduce delivery times in congested cities to hours rather than days.", "authors": ["Keiko Morris", "Jennifer Smith", "Keiko.Morris Wsj.Com", "Jennifer.Smith Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104897/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
