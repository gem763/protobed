Even though cannabis sales have existed behind the scenes for decades, we're beginning to see the impact of how big a legalized marijuana industry could be. Last year, legal global sales sprouted to $10.9 billion, which more than tripled worldwide legal weed revenue from 2014. Looking ahead, sales could quadruple by the time 2024 rolls around.\n\nAlthough the entire world is an opportunity for the cannabis industry, it's the United States that happens to be the crown jewel. Despite estimates varying wildly on Wall Street, one constant is that the U.S. will run circles around other countries when it comes to total sales.\n\nTo date, 33 U.S. states have given the green light for physicians to prescribe medical marijuana to patients for select ailments. Additionally, 11 states have given the all-clear for recreational consumption, with eight states \u2013 Washington, Colorado, Oregon, California, Nevada, Massachusetts, Maine, and Alaska -- currently selling adult-use marijuana in licensed retail dispensaries.\n\nWhat happened with the other three recreationally legal states, you ask? Well, as you're about to read, sales should begin fairly soon.\n\nA tipped-over clear jar packed with cannabis buds that's lying atop a small pile of cash.

Pritzker, a Democrat, put pen to paper and officially signed HB 1438 into law, legalizing recreational weed in the Land of Lincoln, and expunging the criminal records of nearly 800,000 residents with nonviolent crimes who had previously possessed or purchased cannabis. The bill sets up a timeline to commence marijuana sales as of Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nAmong U.S. states, Illinois has a chance to be one of the major players in the marijuana industry. When the duo of Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics released their newest report, \"State of the Legal Cannabis Markets,\" they pegged Illinois for $1.14 billion in annual pot sales by 2024. That should be good enough for 10th-highest among the 50 states.\n\nIllinois represents an intriguing market for a number of U.S. multistate operators, including Cresco Labs (OTC: CRLBF), which aims to have a presence in 11 states. Through organic expansion and acquisitions, Cresco has five retail locations near highly populated Illinois cities and suburbs, and is likely going to be one of the state's top-three cannabis players by market share. According to a June press release from the company, Cresco will also be allowed to open up to five additional dispensaries come January 2020, doubling its presence to the state-maximum of 10 retail locations.\n\nThis upcoming sales launch in Illinois nicely complements Cresco's push into the California market via its pending acquisition of cannabis distribution company Origin House.\n\nA large marijuana sign in front of a dispensary store.
