But for big-box retailers like Target (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), 2019 has been one of the best years so far. Since January\u2019s opening price, Target stock finds itself up over 71%, while WMT has gained a respectable 29%.\n\nTGT Stock: Beware Near-Term Valuation on Target Stock More\n\nSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com\n\nThat said, not all big-box retailers have found the current environment favorable. A notable example is Big Lots (NYSE:BIG), which appears to have finally found a bottom. However, it took a loss of nearly 20% before investors apparently saw some contrarian value in its shares. So, what makes TGT stock stand out in what should be a broader headwind in retail?\n\nPrimarily, I believe that Target owns a moat in the big-box space. Like sector king Walmart, TGT offers discounts to shoppers thanks to its vast scale. It\u2019s also a one-stop shop for various needs, including groceries, health and wellness products, clothing, and electronics. Unlike Walmart, though, Target caters to a more affluent customer. Therefore, Target stock levers an economic cushion similar to Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, because Target owns a moat, it\u2019s able to dictate favorable terms with its suppliers. While other retail companies desperately explore ways to minimize customer impact from the U.S.-China trade war, Target imposes its solution: bluntly, management tells its suppliers to foot the bill.\n\nWhile that might sound like a net negative for TGT stock due to a combative relationship, Target has been doing this for years without recourse, as the charts demonstrate.\n\nBut before you think Target stock is unstoppable, you might want to consider the retailer\u2019s inventory overflow situation.\n\nTarget Stock Vulnerable to Operational Risk\n\nEarlier this month, Business Insider broke a disturbing story about Target\u2019s in-store operational efficiency, or lack thereof. Recently, management quietly cut overnight and backroom shift hours in stores across the nation. Apparently, this was done to increase floor support for customers.\n\nHowever, this move had an unintended consequence. With fewer workers \u2013 which Target refers to as \u201cteam members\u201d \u2013 manning the backroom, the inventory overflow has become untenable. In some cases, heaps of products are stacked on top of each other, making the backroom a fire hazard. Also, guest photographs reveal that excess inventory sometimes spills out into the salesroom floor.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the dirty little secret: even in the best of times, Target\u2019s backrooms \u2013 where I once worked during my college years \u2013 were shoddy. In order to get thing done on time, many workers cut corners on safety protocols.\n\nOrdinarily, such a situation shouldn\u2019t impact TGT stock. After all, I\u2019m fairly certain that all big-box retailers experience these inefficiencies to varying degrees. However, I\u2019ve never seen anything like what Business Insider recently reported.\n\nThe magnitude of this problem is such that I believe it can negatively impact Target stock if left unchecked. While most folks consider backroom duty as a lowly job, it\u2019s an important one for Target. Without hardworking and competent backroom team members, a store will constantly encounter inaccurate inventory counts. Eventually, that leads to very angry guests, who may take their dollars elsewhere.\n\nPlus, let\u2019s talk about the obvious: these are large-scale worker\u2019s comp cases ready to drop Target stock at a moment\u2019s notice. During my Target tenure, I witnessed team member injuries occur in clean backrooms. What we\u2019re seeing here is beyond the pale.\n\nThe Root of the Problem Remains Unresolved\n\nTo be fair, Target responded immediately to the backroom overflow problem. However, responding to a situation doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to forwarding an effective solution. Instead, the root cause \u2013 cutting overnight and backroom hours \u2013 remains unresolved.", "description": "Ordinarily, you'd imagine that a trade war with the world's second-biggest economy would be net negative for the retail industry.
