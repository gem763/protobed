It estimates that taxpayers lost $2.3 million in salaries, work time, travel and other costs related to the international centre.\n\nEllis quit the energy regulator earlier this year and last month Premier Jason Kenney\u2019s government replaced its board. The province is reviewing the regulator\u2019s operations.", "description": "Taxpayers out $2.3 million from actions of former CEO Jim Ellis and other executives between 2017 and 2018, investigation finds", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ellis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
