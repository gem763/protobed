I can\u2019t wait to get finished really.\u2019\n\nComing back post-surgery, the new dad told the cameras: \u2018That\u2019s me done for the day, had the hair transplant as you can see. It\u2019s been amazing, literally took half the time I thought it would.\u2019\n\nDom went under the knife to help his receding hairline (Picture: KSL Clinics)\n\nLook away if you\u2019re squeamish (Picture: KSL Clinics)\n\nHe continued: \u2018Everyone here\u2019s been amazing, made me feel super welcome, and I literally didn\u2019t feel a thing.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re glad to hear it Dom!\n\nIt\u2019s been an exciting October for the star, who just a week ago introduced his new baby with 26-year-old Jess to the world.\n\nDespite sharing some adorable snaps of the bubba, whose name and sex is currently unknown, to Instagram, Jess sadly found herself being trolled online after heading to the gym a few days after posting about the birth of their child.\n\nLuckily, Jess hit back with a kick-ass response to silence her critics.\n\n\u2018Can people stop assuming they know anything about the birth of our child,\u2019 she wrote. \u2018Just because we chose to share an image yesterday doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s when they were born.\u2019\n\nThe new mum added: \u2018Dom, baby and I are happy, healthy and recovering at our own rate.\u2019\n\nPreach, girl.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
