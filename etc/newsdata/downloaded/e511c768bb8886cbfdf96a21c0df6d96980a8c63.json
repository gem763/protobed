However, only 32 per cent said they would accept it in their own marriage.\n\nIn a series of Tweets, Sisters in Islam revealed that 97 per cent of Muslim women in Malaysia identified their primary Islamic responsibility as obedience to God. Almost all (96 per cent) said that obeying their husbands was their responsibility, and 88 per cent said that \u201cmarriage means they are under the care of their husbands\u201d.\n\nMany of Malaysia\u2019s Muslim women also feel the pressures of moral policing and public shaming, with 59 per cent saying they are subject to these. Up to 84 per cent also feel they are judged on how they raise their children.\n\nWorryingly, more than half (57 per cent) feel they do not have adequate social support, and 54 per cent feel they have no legal support.\n\nFunded by the European Union, the study titled \u201cPerceptions and Realities: The Public and Personal Rights of Muslim Women in Malaysia\u201d showed that the nation still has a ways to go for Malaysia\u2019s Muslim women to achieve parity at home and in society.\n\nAccording to South China Morning Post (SCMP), the same survey found that 32 per cent of women also feel they have no right to decide on sexual relations in their marriage.\n\nThe majority \u2013 62 per cent \u2013 of respondents also said it was not acceptable for wives or mothers to be the home\u2019s breadwinner, SCMP reported.\n\nOn Twitter, Sisters in Islam said that the study found that Muslim women think inequality is \u201cpart and parcel of their roles as wives\u201d.\n\n\u201cMuslim women feel that they are expected to bear the injustices imposed on them (as they are \u2018worldly trials\u2019) and not complain or ask for a change in the status quo,\u201d the group said.\n\nUrging for equality in the family to be recognised under Islamic family law, the group said in a tweet: \u201cEquality for women brings positive effects to all members of society\u2026Recent developments have proven that legal reforms do change not just the situation of women for the better, but also shifts the mindset of Malaysian society about women\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nEmpowered women will result in improvements at home, in the workplace, the economy, and in society at large.
