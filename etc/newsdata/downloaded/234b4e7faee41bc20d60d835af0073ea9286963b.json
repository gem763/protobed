Since some parts of this region are constantly bathed in shadow, temperatures can drop down as far as -388 degrees Fahrenheit (-233 Celsius), and it\u2019s been assumed that ice there would remain trapped \u2018virtually forever.\u2019\n\nWith impact marks in the ice from micrometeorites and other debris over a long period on the lunar surface, scientists predicted the ice, inside the Moon's craters, formed at some point after those craters' were created around 3.1 billion years ago.\n\nBut now scientists have spotted what appears to be fresher ice.\n\nIce also exists in smaller craters, suggesting that some of the deposits on the south pole formed there relatively recently.\n\nAriel Deutsch, a graduate student in Brown University's Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences who wrote the study said: 'That was a surprise, there hadn't really been any observations of ice in younger cold traps before.'\n\nIce craters scattered across the Moon's south pole\n\nMs Deutsch said that dating the deposits is important for future lunar explorers who might make use of that ice for fuel and other purposes.\n\nShe added: 'The ages of these deposits can potentially tell us something about the origin of the ice, which helps us understand the sources and distribution of water in the inner solar system.\n\n'For exploration purposes, we need to understand the lateral and vertical distributions of these deposits to figure out how best to access them.\n\n'These distributions evolve with time, so having an idea of the age is important.'\n\nFor the study, Deutsch worked with Jim Head, a professor at Brown, and Gregory Neumann from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nThe highest-quality photographs ever taken of the moon's surface from lunar orbit released by the Indian Space Research Organisation\n\nThe researchers used data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been orbiting the Moon since 2009, to predict the ages of the large craters in which evidence for south pole ice deposits was found.\n\nTo date the craters, researchers counted the number of smaller craters that have hit causing marks inside the larger ones. They have an approximate idea of how many impacts the moon's surface endures over time.\n\nThe majority of the reported ice deposits are found within large craters formed about 3.1 billion years or longer ago, the study found.\n\nSince the ice can't be any older than the crater, that puts an upper bound on the age of the ice.\n\nIf there are indeed deposits of different ages, the researchers say, that suggests they may also have different sources.\n\nOlder ice could have been sourced from water-bearing comets and asteroids impacting the surface, or through volcanic activity that drew water from deep within the Moon.\n\nBut there aren't many big water-bearing impactors around in recent times, and volcanism is thought to have ceased on the Moon over a billion years ago.\n\nSo more recent ice deposits would require different sources -- perhaps bombardment from pea-sized micrometeorites or implantation by solar wind.\n\nResearchers say they hope NASA's Artemis program, which aims to put humans on the Moon by 2024, will be able to help establish this by taking samples.\n\nJim Head, a professor at Brown who partook in the research, said: 'When we think about sending humans back to the Moon for long-term exploration, we need to know what resources are there that we can count on, and we currently don't know.'\n\n'Studies like this one help us make predictions about where we need to go to answer those questions.'", "description": "Researchers from Brown University found evidence of ice in craters which were too new for the ice to have been part of the frozen south pole which formed billions of years ago.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/17/19597570-0-image-a-5_1570809792899.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
