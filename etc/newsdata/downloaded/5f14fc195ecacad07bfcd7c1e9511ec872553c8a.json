Kenneth McKenzie, Jr. explained a group of people left al-Baghdadi's compound when the U.S. special forces approached.\n\n\"The group was treated humanely at all times and included 11 children. I want to make it clear that despite the violent nature of the raid and the \u2014 and the high-profile nature of this assault, every effort was made to avoid civilian casualties and to protect the children that we suspected would be at the compound,\" said McKenzie.\n\n\"Five ISIS members inside the compound presented a threat to the force. They did not respond to commands in Arabic to surrender and they continued to threaten the force,\" he continued. \"They were then engaged by the raid force and killed. There were four women and one man. After this engagement, and once established inside the compound, U.S. Forces discovered Baghdadi hiding in a tunnel. When captured at the hands of U.S. Forces was imminent, Baghdadi detonated a bomb he wore killing himself and two young children that were with him.\"\n\nMcKenzie revealed the injury the military working dog sustained was caused by exposed electrical wires after al-Baghdadi blew himself up and the two kids he brought with him. The dog has been serving with the special forces for four years.\n\nThe compound was then heavily bombed to prevent the building from becoming a shrine to al-Baghdadi's followers.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/30/2019 19:16:24PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/303/a86449d6-2664-469f-90ec-3f19e37c0c6f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
