But his latest venture suggests he\u2019s interested in getting back into the fray. On Wednesday, Higher Ground, the new Netflix-partnered production company he founded with his wife Michelle, debuted its first project: a documentary called American Factory that\u2019s aimed squarely at the heart of American political life.\n\nThe film is an understated yet riveting story of workers struggling to unionize an auto-glass factory in Dayton, Ohio. The plant has a peculiar history: General Motors once ran the factory but shut it down during the financial crisis in 2008. Then in 2015 the Chinese glass manufacturing giant Fuyao re-opened the factory and hired many of the laid-off GM workers, but they were paid less, forced to do more dangerous work, and supervised by an army of Chinese employees.\n\nAmerican Factory doesn\u2019t mention Donald Trump by name, but its tales of Rust Belt gloom are intimately tied to the factors leading to his election \u2014 and his potential reelection. The documentary captures the bleakness of working in manufacturing in a global economy where capital flows freely, robots are ascendant, and laborers are as disposable as paper plates. Its portraits of alienation help explain why Dayton voted Republican in 2016 for the first time in decades.\n\nAmerican Factory tells us quite a bit about Obama\u2019s next chapter and the shape of his future legacy. It seems apropos that a gifted writer who harnessed the power of his personal narrative to catapult himself from freshman senator of Illinois to President of the United States is using storytelling to influence the world politically. To his credit, he appears eager to engage with the Democrats\u2019 inability to foresee Trump\u2019s rise. But Obama\u2019s attempts to encourage the public to see the documentary as a story of finding \u201ccommon ground\u201d suggests that he\u2019s still out of touch with some of the underlying dynamics that gave rise to his successor.\n\nThe film begins on an optimistic note. Fuyao\u2019s revival of the shuttered GM plant gives new life to a community that\u2018s long felt left behind and out of options. Many of the new employees haven\u2019t had a job in years and had lost homes and cars; a steady income at a growing business seems to be a godsend.\n\nThe fact that the company is run from abroad by a dispassionate Chinese billionaire who has to speak to his American employees through a translator seems like a recipe for xenophobia. Instead, however, the American workers are grateful to have jobs, and some of them develop tight bonds with their Chinese supervisors and instructors despite huge language barriers. American Factory is at its most heart-warming and funniest when it depicts Chinese and American employees struggling earnestly to understand each other. (At one point an American worker squints at a text message that translates to \u201cwe are a warehouse to find\u201d on his phone.)\n\nBut the good feelings don\u2019t last. First, the wages are a fraction of what GM used to offer and pay raises are scant. One worker said that at GM she made over $29 an hour; at Fuyao, she makes $12.84. \u201cBack then, if my kids wanted a pair of new gym shoes, I could just get them,\u201d she laments. \u201cI can\u2019t just do that now.\u201d Concerns about workplace safety emerge. Workers are asked to handle larger pieces of glass by hand and carry overly heavily supplies with forklifts in the name of efficiency; even veterans of the factory floor develop their first workplace injuries. One employee divulges that he saw some of the Chinese workers pouring toxic chemicals into drains that he fears could pollute the town\u2019s water supply.\n\nComplaints from the Americans do not land on sympathetic ears. Fuyao\u2019s Chinese leadership considers them lazy, undisciplined, and fussy. At one point Fuyao flies some of the American managers out to their headquarters in China to show them how much more efficient the factory workers in China are. There, the employees work 12-hour shifts, get no more than a few days off each month, and are made to take orders in the style of a military platoon. (While watching the strict drills, one American manager jokes that he wishes he could duct tape the mouths of his workers, and a Chinese manager takes the joke completely seriously.)\n\nBut when stricter controls and greater pressure are placed on the Dayton workers, it only fuels worker efforts to form a union in the workplace, establishing the documentary\u2019s central tension. An eventually-doomed war is waged between workers trying to unionize and a management team willing to do anything possible\u2014including intimidating and terminating rebellious employees\u2014to stop them.\n\nAmerican Factory lends some credence to the \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d side of the debate on why people voted for Trump. While the evidence is clear that racism and xenophobia predicted support of Trump much more strongly than personal economic hardship in 2016, that doesn\u2019t explain the rationale behind every voter or even exhaust the rationale of any single voter who decided to vote for him. American Factory depicts a multiracial slice of the Rust Belt where economic hopelessness rather than virulent white nationalism may have inspired many voters to consider an eccentric outsider who promised to revive their industry over a predictably inattentive Democrat. Hillary Clinton never visited Montgomery County, where Dayton is located; Trump visited twice.\n\nThe Obamas should be commended for helping to bring this complex and beautifully shot story to a large audience. But what\u2019s puzzling is the takeaway from this documentary that Obama seems to be pushing. On social media and in a brief video-recorded conversation with the directors of the documentary, Obama has interpreted American Factory as a paean to how empathy can allow people to transcend political differences. \u201cIf you know someone, if you\u2019ve talked to them face-to-face, if you know what their story is, you can forge a connection,\u201d Obama says in the conversation. \u201cYou may not agree with them on everything, but there\u2019s some common ground to be found and you can more forward together.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Obama is referring to the camaraderie between some of the American and Chinese workers in the film. But in fact, the central plot arc of the film derives all its power from the fact that interpersonal connections are not enough to create common ground. The American workers don\u2019t generally vilify their Chinese managers on racial grounds, but ultimately there are unbridgeable differences over their beliefs on what workers deserve from the company they work for. And those differences weren\u2019t because they failed to talk face-to-face \u2014 there\u2019s plenty of that \u2014 but rather because labor and capital have directly opposing economic interests. As one of the Chinese workers puts it in his description of whether a union or the company\u2019s managers could control the company: \u201cOne mountain cannot hold two tigers.\u201d\n\nOne of the key premises of Obama\u2019s presidency was that he\u2019d fix Washington and revive bipartisan cooperation by listening to the other side of the aisle. But even after eight years of dealing with Republicans operating in bad faith and pathologically corrupt corporate executives, Obama seems to maintain a naive faith in the power of talking things out.\n\nThere are no silver bullets when it comes to protecting workers from globalization and automation. But it\u2019s plainly evident that more robust labor regulations, better legal protections for unions, and a more muscular labor movement would\u2019ve been a game-changer for the Fuyao employees as they were hammered by management. That is to say, sometimes enhancing solidarity with allies is more important than trying to win over an unreformable opponent. Democrats like Obama would be wise to think about that as they contemplate the future and hopefully re-examine the efficacy of sitting down for friendly chats.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.", "description": "'American Factory' on Netflix is a solid film, but Obama's message of finding common ground in an uneven labor dispute ignores working people's realities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d60277ea8aa4b0009f2c82b/lede/1566582655935-AmericanFactoryObamaNetflix.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
