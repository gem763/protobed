This represents the largest coordinated action against online scammers yet undertaken.\n\nWired reports that the DOJ has announced the arrest of 281 individuals suspected to be connected to email scams and wire transfer fraud. The sweeping arrests were the biggest of its kind yet against digital scammers and shows law enforcement sense of urgency in dealing with the rapidly growing threat of online scams.\n\nWired reports:\n\nTuesday\u2019s law enforcement initiative, dubbed Operation reWired, involved extensive international coordination to make 167 arrests in Nigeria, 74 in the United States, 18 in Turkey, and 15 in Ghana. The remainder took place in France, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom. Research and law enforcement investigations have shown that a large proportion of all email scamming originates in West Africa, specifically Nigeria, but the scams have spread, partly because some West African actors have moved around the world.\n\nWired notes that email scams have become widespread in the last few years and attacks have become increasingly sophisticated:\n\nThe scams feel so pervasive in part because they\u2019re not always just basic email scams. They encompass a complex web of connections between traditional email scamming, W-2 tax fraud, check fraud, gift card scams, and more involved schemes.\n\nFor example, employment scammers trick people into submitting their personally identifying information to bogus job listings and then \u201chire\u201d them for work-from-home jobs. They overpay them for their work, and then ask the victim to wire back the overage before the initial payment goes through. Similar bait-and-switch fraud centers on rentals, lottery tickets, and online car sales. In romance scams, attacks will spend months or even years establishing deceptive romantic relationships with victims online. They\u2019ll then not only siphon their target\u2019s money directly but use them as middlemen to transmit stolen funds\n\nWired adds that although the sudden arrest of 281 individuals seems like a big deal, due to the scale and popularity of digital scams it may not have as big an effect as many may thing:\n\n\u201cWill it make a dent? It\u2019s really hard to say,\u201d says Crane Hassold, senior director of threat research at Agari who previously worked as a digital behavior analyst for the FBI, of the arrests. \u201cThere are so many actors doing BEC and other types of social engineering scams\u2014there could be thousands, especially in West Africa\u2014that it\u2019s going to be difficult to make a significant impact overall.\u201d\n\nRead the full report in Wired here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
