Now they\u2019re in children\u2019s books | Aditya Chakrabortty", "language": "en", "text": "I have just read a beautiful book about something truly obscene. Full of lovely pictures and occasional bits of text, it\u2019s the kind you might read with your four-year-old. It shows a little girl and her mum as they visit a food bank.\n\nIt\u2019s a No-Money Day is narrated by the daughter who sees how her mother worries over every penny, while shielding her from the painful stuff. \u201cThere\u2019s no more cereal, so I have the last piece of toast. Luckily Mum isn\u2019t hungry,\u201d the girl says; and you know the biggest thing Mum will have for breakfast is her own little white lie. When they reach the food bank, the child tucks into biscuits and squash while her mother sags like a balloon from which the air has escaped.\n\nOnly just published, it is believed to be the UK\u2019s first picture book about food banks. And, while the subject has been handled compassionately by the prize-winning author Kate Milner, I can\u2019t help but see that landmark as a disgrace \u2013 for me and for you. It is the watershed moment when Britain\u2019s food banks go from newspaper headlines to a subject that teachers cover in classrooms; the moment at which mass destitution is no longer a badge of political failure but is instead accepted as part of British life.\n\nAs recently as 10 years ago, child poverty was an evil that prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown both vowed to abolish; now it is something you shamefacedly explain to your child as he or she nestles in your lap.\n\nPicture books used to be small worlds where kids could dream about farmyard animals and cuddly monsters; today they teach about the vast number of people that their parents\u2019 generation treat like dirt. In 2016 David Cameron casually dropped the legally binding targets to reduce child poverty \u2013 and those figures jumped. More than 4 million children live in poverty in the UK today \u2013 or nine kids in every classroom of 30. At the start of this decade, the Trussell Trust ran just 57 food banks, giving 14,000 food parcels a year to children. It operated 428 food banks last year, handing nearly 580,000 parcels to children. This is a charity that sees itself as temporary. Our failure as a society is making it permanent.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The book shows a little girl and her mum as they visit a food bank. Illustration: Kate Milner\n\nIn one of the richest societies in human history, such figures should mortify us, yet the Westminster classes take them as unremarkable. They hardly ever trouble TV bulletins or newspaper columns, while Conservative cabinet ministers such as Michael Gove sneer at the impoverished for not being able to \u201cmanage their finances\u201d.\n\nAs the UK staggers into a rage-filled general election, well-lunched gasbags will solemnly inform us that this is an election about \u201dgetting Brexit done\u201d \u2013 while ignoring the cuts, the broken economy and the other causes that helped to drive the Brexit vote of 2016. Dealing with the latter would entail being winched out of the deep embrace of those TV studio sofas, tearing out the IV drip that feeds them the untreated bullshit of No 10 \u201csources\u201d, and seeing more of the country than could ever be conveyed in a fleeting vox pop.\n\nIf they did that, they would confront a society where levels of deprivation once considered shameful are now treated as normal; where what was scratched together just a few months ago is now relied on as part of the new, ad hoc welfare state.\n\nThis week I went to Colchester, in Essex, to see something both brilliant and saddening: a Munch Club. In a small scout hut on the postwar Monkwick housing estate, 45 children and their parents were getting a free lunch to ease the expense of half-term holidays. Tiny kids were burrowing into mountains of chicken nuggets and chips before collecting chocolate cake in custard. There\u2019ll be Munch Clubs across the town this week, run by volunteers and depending on donations. They\u2019re the idea of Maureen Powell, a local pensioner with a sharp blond bob and a smoker\u2019s laugh. She started here just a year ago, and by Christmas plans to run no fewer than six Munch Clubs. People keep asking her to lay on more, and she thinks she knows the number-one reason why.\n\n\u201cUniversal credit!\u201d she shouts, putting the blame squarely on the policy spawned by that Essex MP Iain Duncan Smith. \u201cYou have to wait five weeks for any money to turn up; and they mess you about. They [the government] give you a [starting] loan, which they take out of your benefits. It\u2019s just debt upon debt upon debt.\u201d\n\nTo keep the clubs going, Maureen often raids her state pension while her small home is crammed with four freezers and three fridges to store supplies. As indicated by the crutch with which she hobbles, she has her own issues \u2013 arthritis, asthma and secondary multiple sclerosis. Let me speak plainly: Powell is a hero, yet nothing about this system feels like an adequate replacement for a proper welfare state. Except that\u2019s not something the UK can say it really has any more \u2013 not when the state prefers literally to melt 50p pieces of hubris rather than keep citizens from starving.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Luckily Mum isn\u2019t hungry.\u2019 Illustration: Kate Milner\n\nAt one table sit Gary and Rebecca, surrounded by their five kids. She raises the children, while he stacks shelves at a supermarket. When his wages hit their bank account, the money is all gone on bills by that same afternoon. Their universal credit top-up is just not enough.\n\n\u201cIf we weren\u2019t here, neither Gary nor me would eat anything till dinner, so as to leave more for the kids,\u201d says Rebecca. How do they cope with the hunger? \u201cYou get used to it,\u201d she shrugs. Their children get neither sweets nor treats, and their parents can\u2019t afford to take them to Colchester zoo or the fireworks. I think about the classroom tradition of talking about what you did in your holidays and wonder what these kids say. I wonder how tough things get at home, and how much they overhear.\n\nNot far away is Bevan Close, a reminder of the Labour minister who built this estate. Nye Bevan wanted communities founded on fairness, where \u201cthe doctor, the grocer, the butcher and the farm labourer all live[d] in the same street\u201d. What has replaced his vision? When Cameron entered No 10, Colchester borough council received \u00a311m a year from Whitehall. It\u2019s a sum that has dropped and dropped: this year it is \u00a3275,000; next year, precisely zero. Common lawns on the estate used to get cut every month; now it\u2019s only three times a year. Police officers used to patrol on foot; now, says councillor Dave Harris, \u201cthe only time a cop car turns up is when there\u2019s really bad news\u201d. The big NHS clinic, where parents took newborns to be weighed, is now shuttered up.\n\nWe could talk about austerity or tough choices, but something far more profound has happened here \u2013 a poor area a couple of hours from Westminster has been systematically stripped of some of the rudiments of civilised life. This is the new normal for swaths of Britain: where a man can be declared fit for work shortly before dying; where headteachers have to beg parents for toilet roll; where children must rely on a sick pensioner to keep them fed out of term time.\n\nThat\u2019s what this election is really about: not Brexit, not Boris v Jezza, but how we define a civilised society.\n\n\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Britain\u2019s first picture book about families going hungry is a grim reminder of the issues at the heart of this election, says Guardian columnist Aditya Chakrabortty", "authors": ["Aditya Chakrabortty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f8b72ea15fd726b9619d6ae4947e08ec253b217/3070_294_3143_1886/master/3143.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fdebbc8e07447ff7d3e33b88fc6dcb16", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
