Man U vs Brighton is our aim!\"\n\n(Image: Waymont8/Twitter)\n\nThe tweet included the Twitter handles of Rashford, Jesse Lingard and Paul Pogba, as well as a picture of John with his United shirt.\n\nAnd it was Rashford - a lifelong United fan himself - who was first to respond.\n\nRashford replied to the tweet last month saying he would sort the tickets, and has now come good on his promise by tweeting that John has the tickets he wanted.\n\n(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)\n\nBut the 21-year-old forward went a step further, tweeting United legend Neville to ask for help in sorting a hotel room for John.\n\nNeville owns Hotel Football which overlooks Old Trafford, and Rashford tweeted the treble-winning right-back saying: \"Fancy helping with the hotel @GNev2... heard you might know a place?\"\n\nNeville was quick to respond, replying to Rashford's tweet with a thumbs-up emoji and saying the hotel was 'sorted'.\n\nThe gesture drew an admiring response from Twitter users, with even a City fan posting: \"lovely that\".", "description": "Pals wanted United match tickets for a lifelong US fan after raising money for him to fly to Britain - and Rashford and Neville went above and beyond to help", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Twitter", "Manchester United Via Getty Imag"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20702107.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-22-at-221345.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
