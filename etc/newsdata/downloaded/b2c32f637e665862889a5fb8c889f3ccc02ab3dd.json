The list is endless, old sport.\n\nBut perhaps the most frustrating of all is dogfishing - when people use dogs for their dating profile to give the illusion that they own a doggo when they in fact do not.\n\nIt's been happening on dating apps for years, it's probably happened to you on multiple occasions, but now it seems to have gained an official name.\n\nIf you use dating apps, you'll be well aware of the worst kept secret in the game: dogs equal dates.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nSo when you come across that person who catches your eye and they've got their arm wrapped around a Golden Retriever called Cooper, you feel like you've hit the jackpot.\n\nBut what if it's all a lie? Your days, weeks or sometimes even months of overly-calculated messages constructed to get you into a position petting that dog are replaced by the cold reality that Cooper won't be joining you on the date.\n\nWith more and more people using dogs to enhance their chances of bagging a match, dating expert Erika Ettin told The Washington post she thinks people are faking dog ownership because it suggests a person has nurturing qualities, especially men.\n\n\"Sometimes women subconsciously equate things like how a man treats his dog is how he would treat a partner,\" she said.\n\n\"That\u2019s the main thing: stop borrowing dogs. It\u2019s just odd when you\u2019re using someone else\u2019s dog online, and it seems like you\u2019re trying too hard.\"\n\nSo if you're going to put a dog on your profile, at least have the decency to bring it on the date.", "description": "You've probably been the victim of dogfishing on many occasions - but now it has an official name", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20579633.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Portrait-of-charming-girl-in-kitchen-texting-on-phone.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
