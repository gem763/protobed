Email your money conundrums to mytwocents@nymag.com Photo: H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock\n\nI\u2019m 32 and recently got married. For most of my life, I\u2019ve been pretty responsible with money \u2014 saved, paid bills on time, etc. But after planning our wedding, I feel like I\u2019ve gone totally off the rails. Once I started signing checks for thousands of dollars, it became a slippery slope. I\u2019ve been shopping a lot more, because what\u2019s a $100 shirt compared to the $15,000 we paid for our wedding venue? (We got some help from our parents, but still.) I used to be more mindful of little expenses, because I know they can add up, but now I just can\u2019t bring myself to care as much. I\u2019ve tried to cut back, but I just don\u2019t have the discipline that I used to. How can I get out of this weird mind-set of constantly treating myself? My savings are running pretty low at this point.\n\nWelcome to the alternate reality of weddings. It\u2019s basically a fun-house mirror for money, where price tags get so distorted that it\u2019s easy to forget what\u2019s reasonable (or just stop caring). When I was getting married, I remember almost throwing up when I heard our caterer\u2019s quote for serving peanut-butter sandwiches at the end of our reception (a cute and economical midnight snack, I had thought). \u201cAre they sprinkled with gold?!\u201d I ranted. Then we ordered them anyway.\n\nLike you, I went through a weird recalibration after my wedding was over. For months, the whole world had urged me to spend gobs of money to look and feel as close to perfect as possible because \u201cyou only get to do it once!\u201d and, \u201cthe pictures!\u201d While this treat-yourself vortex was surreal and stressful, it was also fun, in a dizzying and unhinged sort of way. I\u2019ll buy a wedding dress and shoes \u2026 and also this random bathrobe and bathing suit, because what\u2019s another $150?\n\nWhen I finally came back down to earth, I was significantly poorer, horrified that I\u2019d been such a sucker for the wedding-industrial complex, and a little sad that I couldn\u2019t rationalize my reckless credit-card swiping anymore (not that I ever really could). I think this experience is common, not just for newlyweds but also for anyone who goes through a period of heavy spending outside their usual scope. A similar thing happened when I recently moved apartments and bought a new sofa and rug \u2014 suddenly I was buying new cups, plates, silverware, and pillows, too. A friend likened it to going on a bender after falling off the wagon: \u201cI\u2019ve already had one drink, so I might as well finish the whole bottle, score some cocaine, and sleep with half the people in this bar.\u201d\n\nAcademics don\u2019t appear to have a name for this particular spending phenomenon, but it\u2019s similar to the \u201cWhat the Hell Effect,\u201d which is used in the context of willpower and eating. It describes the human tendency to indulge, feel bad about it, and then keep going because, well, what the hell \u2014 you\u2019ve blown it already, so why not finish the whole pie?\n\nResearch has found that the \u201cWhat the Hell Effect\u201d is exacerbated by guilt and self-criticism. In one (rather sad) study, female college students were divided into three different groups and given bowls of candy. Before the candy appeared, the first group was fed a doughnut and given a reassuring message about self-compassion, the second group was fed a doughnut but received no message, and the third group got neither. The group that ate the doughnut but wasn\u2019t encouraged to feel self-compassionate went on to consume significantly more candy than the two other groups, suggesting that the doughnut (and resulting self-criticism) was a trigger. Meanwhile, a different study found that dieters were more likely than non-dieters to overeat cookies after they were served a large slice of pizza. The takeaway: A restrictive, shameful mentality sets you up to go hog wild once you\u2019ve gotten off track, but a more flexible and forgiving mind-set can help you get back in the saddle more quickly.\n\nTo apply this to money: Try not to lump your current overspending in with the gigantic cost of your wedding. You might think, I can\u2019t believe I bought that thing on TOP of what I\u2019ve spent this year \u2014 I\u2019ve lost my mind, but that\u2019ll only make you spiral further. Instead, recognize that what\u2019s past is past. Take a breath, resist the urge to berate yourself, and remember that your wedding was an isolated and unusual situation, not the beginning of a scary pattern that you lack the fortitude to reverse. Research shows that confidence (or \u201cself-efficacy\u201d) is half the battle in following a budget; don\u2019t let one period of excessive spending knock yours.\n\nAnother part of your problem is that you now have a much higher benchmark for what \u201ca lot\u201d of money looks like, says Carey Morewedge, a professor of marketing at Boston University who researches biases in decision-making. \u201cPeople tend to think about expenses in a relative fashion rather than absolute fashion,\u201d he explains. For example, say you\u2019re shopping for winter boots and you find one pair for $125 and another pair for $900. \u201cNormally, that would seem like a huge price difference,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve recently paid $15,000 for a wedding venue, the relative difference between $125 and $900 starts to seem more negligible.\u201d This is often referred to as a skewed \u201ccomparison standard,\u201d and it explains your newfound carelessness with smaller expenses \u2014 next to $15K, they don\u2019t seem to matter, even though they still add up the way they always did.\n\nLowering your financial benchmarks isn\u2019t easy, but it can be done. \u201cOnce people become accustomed to higher spending, they typically shift their reference point so that it becomes the new normal,\u201d says Morewedge. \u201cThere\u2019s no quick fix for that, but I would suggest a clean break. Maybe take a few months of fiscal sobriety \u2014 make a rule that you won\u2019t buy anything new, and reset your habits.\u201d\n\nOne other tactic might be helpful: Try going cash-only for a while. Studies have found that people who stop using credit cards become more conscious of the value of their purchases, because it increases the \u201cpain of paying.\u201d While swiping a card (or, even worse, buying something online) makes financial transactions more abstract. There\u2019s nothing like parting with physical dollar bills to make you reflect on exactly how much something costs and whether it\u2019s worth it. Perhaps paying so much for your wedding dulled those \u201cpain\u201d senses; you want to re-sharpen them.\n\nDon\u2019t approach these measures as punitive. The point is to prove to yourself that you can be just as happy with less \u2014 which is objectively true. Most humans have a baseline level of happiness that they return to regardless of positive or negative events in their lives. My guess is that once you return to that level, and a budget that\u2019s sustainable, you\u2019ll feel a lot more freedom in general.", "description": "Welcome to the alternate reality of weddings.
