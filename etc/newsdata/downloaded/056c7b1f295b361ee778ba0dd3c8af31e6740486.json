The fans have a special place in my heart and this gives me strength,' he said, as quoted by the club.\n\nHe was, until Robert Lewandowski broke his record in March this year, the Bundesliga's top-scoring foreigner, and sits fifth in the all-time charts for the division with 197.\n\nHe also holds the oldest hat-trick record, set in March 2016 at Bayer Leverkusen at what now seems like the relatively tender age of 37.\n\nThere is also, naturally, a place at the top of Werder Bremen's all-time scoring charts with 153 goals in 305 appearances over four spells and nine-and-a-bit seasons.\n\nThere is still nearly an entire campaign to keep driving that total up even further.\n\nWith six league appearances - plus a two-goal display against SV Atlas in the DFB Pokal - this season, Pizarro is not being kept on for sentiment's sake.\n\nOf course, every time he steps onto the field he breaks his own mark for Bremen's oldest-ever player. Last time out, in a draw with Borussia Dortmund, it stood at 40 years 11 months 25 days.\n\nPizarro won six German league titles, five German Cups and the Champions League in 2013\n\nA one-year, two-goal spell at Premier League Chelsea was a rare failure in the career of Pizarro\n\nPIZARRO HONOURS Bayern Munich Bundesliga: 2002\u201303, 2004\u201305, 2005\u201306, 2012\u201313, 2013\u201314, 2014\u201315 DFB-Pokal: 2002\u201303, 2004\u201305, 2005\u201306, 2012\u201313, 2013\u201314 DFL-Supercup: 2012 UEFA Champions League: 2012\u201313 UEFA Super Cup: 2013 Intercontinental Cup: 2001 FIFA Club World Cup: 2013 Werder Bremen DFB-Pokal: 2008\u201309 Alianza Lima Torneo Clausura: 1999\n\nAfter beginning his career with spells at Deportivo Pesquero and Alianza Lima in his native Peru, Pizarro earned a move to Werder Bremen in 1999.\n\nTwo seasons and 38 goals were all it took for Bayern Munich to snap up the 22-year-old for a prolific and trophy-laden six years.\n\nA barren spell at Chelsea, encompassing two goals in 32 games, is nigh-on the only blight in an otherwise sparkling career. Naturally, he redeemed himself immediately upon returning to Werder Bremen in 2008, notching 28 goals then 29 goals for the club in consecutive seasons.\n\nTwo years later, Bayern came calling again for three less prolific seasons that still included their famous 2013 Champions League triumph.\n\nA third spell at Bremen followed in 2015, with a year in Cologne immediately followed by a fourth and final stint in green.\n\nThere is also a 17-year international career that number 20 goals in 85 caps after ending in 2016.\n\nWith 27 Bundesliga games left in his illustrious career, Pizarro will be desperate to make them count.", "description": "As Claudio Pizarro readied himself for his customary late cameo for Werder Bremen against RB Leipzig last month, he may have allowed himself a little smile.", "authors": ["James Ayles For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/21/19758672-0-image-a-15_1571171962816.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
