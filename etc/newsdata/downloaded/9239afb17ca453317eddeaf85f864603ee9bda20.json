Also, the trees planted at her birth will have to be taken proper care of by them, and the parents are legally tied to this affidavit.\n\nSeed It Forward\n\nThis is in effort to ensure that the trees that have been planted, survive.\n\nApparently, \u2018Shyam Sundar Paliwal, the village\u2019s past leader, first suggested this tradition in honor of his daughter who passed away at a young age. In the past 6 years, over a quarter of a million trees have been planted\u2019, according to Seed It Forward.\n\nIt's not just a wonderful way to celeberate, but also a commendable tradition - one that needs to be learnt from and replicated as much as possible, especially since we are in the middle of a severe environmental crisis.\n\nInput From Seed It Forward", "description": "Some people use the Internet to forward useless content and some people efficiently use it to spread awareness and knowledge.
