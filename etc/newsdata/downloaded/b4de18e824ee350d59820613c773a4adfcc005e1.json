Today I\u2019m worried about being ugly; tomorrow I might stop thinking forever.\u201d\n\nRenia went on to tell of being \u201cshut away in the ghetto\u201d in Przemy\u015bl on 15 July 1942 before being smuggled out by her first love Zygmunt Schwarzer, who was working with the local resistance.\n\nShe spent the last days of her life hiding in an attic with Zygmunt\u2019s parents and recorded her final diary entry on 28 July: \u201cHear O Israel, save us, help us! You have kept me safe from bullets and bombs, from grenades, help me to survive, help us!\u201d\n\nTwo days later they were discovered by German soldiers and the three were shot dead on the street.\n\nHow the diary survived the war remains unclear. Somehow, despite passing through Auschwitz-Birkenau and other Nazi camps, Zygmunt was able to deliver the blue-lined notebook to Renia\u2019s mother and sister in New York in 1950.\n\nRenia\u2019s sister Elizabeth told the BBC: \u201cI have read only some of it because I used to cry all the time. She was like my surrogate mother.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
