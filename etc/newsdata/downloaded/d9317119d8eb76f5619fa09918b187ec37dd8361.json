So what to do if your child has missed a final exam?\n\nXolani wrote to us with this common concern, so we gathered the relevant information to advise and assist all parents in this situation.\n\nGood day,\n\nMy child could not write his matric paper yesterday as he was not feeling well, he was admitted to the hospital for food poisoning.\n\nWhat recourse do we have for him to write?\n\nKind regards,\n\nXolani\n\nWe called the Western Cape Department Of Education and a representative explained that if Xolani has a medical certificate, it must be sent to the school. The school will forward it to the department, and the boy will be able to rewrite the exam he missed in June the following year.\n\nTo qualify for the NSC June 2020 exams, the following conditions apply:\n\nCandidates are only allowed to rewrite subjects they had previously registered for in the October/November 2019 examination.\n\nCandidates with valid reasons for absenteeism (e.g. a medical condition, the death of an immediate family member, or other special circumstances) from one or more of the NSC October/November 2019 examinations will be allowed to register for the NSC June 2020 examination.\n\nThese candidates will be able to choose between writing just the unwritten exam or all examination question papers.\n\nAlso read: What are the NEW matric pass requirements?\n\nThe NSC June 2020 examination is also open to candidates who could not write one or more of the October/November 2019 exams for reasons not listed above.
