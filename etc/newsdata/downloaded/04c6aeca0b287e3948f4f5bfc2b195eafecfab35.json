Ben Cardin said Romney has already developed a reputation for having an independent streak and speaking his mind. \u201cI think Mitt Romney is perceived as being what you want to see from a United States senator,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy said Romney reminds him of what it was like back when he joined the Senate in 1975, when both Democrats and Republicans spoke freely, even if that meant criticizing their own party.\n\nRomney has not yet said he supports impeachment, but he has said he\u2019s waiting to see where the House investigation leads. Though Sen. Brian Schatz pointed out that even he and many other Democrats had not come to the conclusion that an impeachment inquiry was necessary until recently.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to create a situation where this becomes purely a question of which team you belong to,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people need to take a little longer or have to massage their own home state politics to get to the right place, we have to allow them to get there.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Buzzfeednews.Com Article Paulmcleod Mitt-Romney-Democrats-Trump-Impeachment"], "top_image": ""}
