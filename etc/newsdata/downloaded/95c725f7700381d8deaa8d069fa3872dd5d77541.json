She said that six House investigating committees \u2014 Intelligence, Oversight, Judiciary, Financial Services, Foreign Affairs, and Ways and Means \u2014 would be \u201cmoving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe announcement came shortly after Pelosi met with House Democrats. One person who was in the room for that meeting told Yahoo News that there was \u201cno confidence in leadership to do it well.\u201d In particular, that person said some Democrats pushed for the creation of a single select panel to carry out the impeachment investigation.\n\nPelosi resisted that push, however, in effect leaving the House Judiciary Committee in charge of all impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cShe said in the meeting that she is telling the chairs [of the five committees other than Judiciary] to pass along relevant information to the Judiciary Committee,\u201d a House staffer told Yahoo News.\n\nThat means, the staffer added, that any possible articles of impeachment would originate in the Judiciary Committee before being sent for a vote in the full House.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi; President Trump.

Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., whom they saw as ineffectively conducting hearings involving potentially crucial witnesses like former 2016 Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\n\n\u201cThis is an emergency. We don\u2019t have the luxury of time [with] another committee,\u201d tweeted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nThe creation of a select committee would require considerable time to allocate funding and pick staff, which some members saw as an undesirable delay for a process that is already likely to drift into the heart of a presidential campaign this winter and next spring.\n\nA critical subtext is that progressives in the House also see Nadler \u2014 and the Judiciary Committee as a whole \u2014 as more progressive than Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and the Intelligence Committee, one staffer said.\n\nThe shift came days after revelations that during a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asked him to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, a businessman with dealings in the country. The elder Biden is seeking to challenge Trump in the 2020 presidential election, making the request for an investigation a seeming act of political retribution.\n\nAs Washington spent a day in the grip of feverish impeachment speculation, Trump was in New York, attending the United Nations General Assembly. Trying to quell the furor over the Ukraine matter, Trump said he would release the full transcript of his phone call with Zelensky on Wednesday.\n\nBut that gesture was not enough for Democrats, who insist on seeing a complaint filed by a whistleblower in the intelligence community that first described the allegedly problematic phone call.\n\n\u201cWe need the complaint,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said at a press availability in the U.S. Capitol shortly after Trump announced that he would release the transcript of the phone call. \u201cSimply releasing the transcript is not going to come close to ending the need of the American public and the Congress to see what actually happened.\u201d Late Tuesday evening, White House officials said they were planning to release the whistleblower\u2019s complaint as well as the Inspector General\u2019s report on it by the end of the week.", "description": "The announcement came shortly after Speaker Nancy Pelosi met with House Democrats.
