Vote Trump 2020.\u201d\n\nThe airplane was hired by the Trump reelection campaign in what is likely a preview of how the president will treat his eventual opponent: as a leftist dangerous to ordinary Americans.\n\nAn airplane pulls a banner supporting President Trump before the Democratic presidential debate in Houston on Thursday.

Kamala Harris of California said in her opening statement. She charged him with fostering a national atmosphere of \u201chate, intimidation, fear,\u201d before dismissing him with a quip about his favored network: \u201cAnd now, President Trump, you can go back to watching Fox News.\u201d\n\nTrump was actually in Baltimore. But the Trump campaign certainly was watching, and it used the debate to mock, needle and criticize the Democrats.\n\n\u201cPresident @realDonaldTrump would crush any one of these radical \u2018top tier\u2019 Dems!\u201d tweeted national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany during the debate. In fact, polls show the opposite to be true, but if the 2020 Trump campaign learned anything from its 2016 predecessor, it is not to trust polls, which uniformly predicted a Hillary Clinton victory.\n\nAt the same time, Trump\u2019s reelection campaign is a vastly more professional enterprise than the one that helped him win three years ago. Throughout the night, the campaign sent emails rebutting the Democratic candidates, who variously depicted Trump as divisive, dangerous and incompetent. The Trump campaign rebuttals took liberties with the truth, as did some of the Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhile the Democrats are debating Medicare for All and a \u2018public option,\u2019 only one fact matters: all of these proposals will kill private health insurance plans,\u201d one of the Trump \u201crapid response\u201d emails said. Such messages, commonly sent by campaigns, are meant as rebuttals to be used by the press. The one on health care, for example, accused former Vice President Joe Biden of \u201clying\u201d about allowing Americans to keep their private insurance plans should they choose to do so.\n\nAnother of the debate-night emails struck out at Pete Buttigieg, the young mayor of South Bend, Ind., who has been something of a star in the primary campaign, even if that star has dimmed some in recent weeks. The Trump campaign sought to dim it even further.\n\n\u201cWe know Pete Buttigieg is busy jetting around the country in style as he runs for president, but every once in a while he should probably consider paying a visit to the town he pretends to manage,\u201d the email said, linking to a newspaper story about Buttigieg\u2019s struggles with race relations and policing. The story was published in the New York Times, an outlet Trump routinely denounces as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nThere were similar counterattacks on energy, China, African-American unemployment and gun control.\n\n\u201cSo the conclusion to the Democrat debate,\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, wrote as the long evening was coming to a close. \u201cWe are taking away your healthcare. We are taking away your guns. We are taking away your paycheck. A vote for any of these Democrats is a vote to eliminate your freedom!\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "An airplane above Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate venue trailed a banner: \u201cSocialism will kill Houston\u2019s economy!
