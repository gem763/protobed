The median forecast in the poll was for the benchmark rate to remain unchanged through next year and into 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nINCOMPREHENSIBLE\n\nThe Riksbank was one of the first central banks to push rates below zero in a previously untried experiment to get the economy moving again after the financial crisis of 2008-9.\n\nBut it has proved tricky to negotiate an exit, with the Riksbank only managing a single rate hike since mid-2011 despite an economy expanding at close to maximum speed.\n\nConcern among central bankers and economists has been growing about the effects of negative rates on savers, banks and pension funds along with worries that should another downturn bite, there is little left in armouries to stimulate demand.\n\nMany analysts believe the Riksbank should have normalised policy much sooner, following the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and neighbour Norway in hiking rates.\n\n\"In my view it is incomprehensible,\" Danske Bank analyst Michael Grahn said, referring to the timing of the decision to start tightening policy.\n\n\"The entire economic picture is weaker than the Riksbank has been expecting. On top of that the inflation pace is quite a bit below target, inflation expectations are coming down, and other central banks are moving in the opposite direction.\"\n\nNorway's central bank kept its key rate on hold at 1.5% on Thursday after four rate hikes in a year, the most recent in September. It sees rates on hold for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe European Central Bank meets later in the day, but is not expected to add further stimulus after last month's package, which included a rate cut, while the U.S. Federal Reserve could cut rates again when it meets at the end of this month.\n\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Sweden economy: http://tmsnrt.rs/2bylYpf\n\nGRAPHIC: Riksbank rate, inflation and the Krona: ttp://tmsnrt.rs/1qEN4Rz\n\n(Corrects period of negative interest rates in lead to almost five years from more than five years)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Simon Johnson, Anna Ringstrom, Helena Soderpalm; Editing by Niklas Pollard and Catherine Evans)", "description": "Sweden's central bank held its benchmark repo rate unchanged at -0.25% as expected on Thursday but surprised many by saying it would bring an end to an almost five-year experiment with negative rates in December even though the economy is slowing.
