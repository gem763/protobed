If there were a 4x100m relay race of all the teams involved in the World Cup they\u2019d be fastest.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be well-organised and they\u2019re going to have a strong defence and strong kicking game. They\u2019ve got blow torch speed on the edges.\u201d\n\nThe former rugby league international halfback said he had high regard for South Africa scrumhalf Faf de Klerk and flyhalf Handre Pollard, but it was Kolbe and his dancing feet who stood out for him.\n\nEdwards said that the 25-year-old winger, who has scored two tries in three matches in the tournament so far, reminded him of England\u2019s 2003 World Cup winning winger and fellow rugby league convert Jason Robinson.\n\n\u201cIf you want to go and watch a game of rugby, you want to go and watch Cheslin Kolbe,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep our eye on his, he\u2019s one of the most dynamic players I\u2019ve ever seen. I was lucky enough to play with Jason Robinson.\n\n\u201cI was his captain at Wigan when he first came in the Wigan team. Kolbe\u2019s a similar player to Jason, incredibly explosive, short and defies the fact that you have to be big to play the game of rugby.\u201d\n\nAfter conceding 19 points in the quarter-final victory over France in Oita last Sunday, Edwards said he would be looking to restrict the damage to closer to the 13 to 15 points mark in Yokohama.\n\nOverall, though, he thought the match would be decided on how well each side stopped the other from getting over the gainline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a battle royal on that advantage line,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause a lot of people think that in defence, you don\u2019t want to miss any tackles but it\u2019s not one of the key performance indicators of whether you are going to win a game.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest ones is gainline. Did you give up the gainline, did you not give up the gainline? That is the biggest indicator of whether you win or lose the game in defence.\u201d", "description": "Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards is just as concerned about the 'blowtorch' pace of Cheslin Kolbe and the South Africa outside backs as the big men of the Springboks pack ahead of Sunday's Rugby World Cup semi-final.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443654474&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0MV-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
