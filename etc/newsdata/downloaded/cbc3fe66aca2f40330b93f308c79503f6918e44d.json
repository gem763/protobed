(Though far more gently in most cases than the treatment President Trump receives for far more minor slips of the lip.) Some are still insisting that this was the gaffe that was finally going to sink Crazy Uncle Joe, though the chatter on cable news has already died down a bit as of this morning.\n\nSo is this it? Is this the end? Taking the affirmative side in this debate is Salem\u2019s own Hugh Hewitt, writing at the Washington Post. He\u2019s taken time to analyze precisely what went down and come to the conclusion that this could indeed be the beginning of the end.\n\nJust to be sure I heard it correctly, I replayed former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s eye-popping gaffe from Thursday night\u2019s debate instructing poor parents to put the record player on to help their children learn. \u201c#Record player\u201d was trending on Twitter by the time I took to the airwaves at 6 a.m. Friday, so my suspicion had already been confirmed: This was more than a gaffe that causes eye rolls. It was one of those gaffes that underscores a candidate\u2019s central weakness and continues to bleed away votes long after its utterance. Recall Sen. John F. Kerry\u2019s \u201cI actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it,\u201d or then-President Gerald Ford\u2019s famous \u201cThere is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe\u201d from a 1976 debate. Gaffes are like sharks. Some are sand sharks that scare you. Others are Jaws-like beasts. After Thursday night, Biden is going to need a bigger boat.\n\nI\u2019m going to take this opportunity to at least partially disagree with Hugh, even if we arrive at the same eventual destination. What he\u2019s focusing on is the clear, though unspoken message in Biden\u2019s answer. Of course, it was rather hard to parse out exactly what he meant. I watched as a number of the more liberal cable news talkers struggled to pick apart that answer, often using an awkward phrase like, at least what I think Biden was trying to say\u2026\n\nAs to the substance of the answer, I have to agree. It seems clear that Joe Biden was implying that black families aren\u2019t spending enough time with their children at home and participating in their education. And if that interpretation really catches fire among primary voters, it\u2019s going to be a huge albatross around his neck. Of course, what Biden was saying is absolutely true, but it\u2019s in no way restricted to black families. I\u2019ve spent many posts here bemoaning the way parents these days too often look at public schools as free baby sitters while they go to work and dump the job of preparing them for college and adulthood in the schools\u2019 laps. This problem crosses all racial and religious boundaries, from what I can tell, with the possible exception of Asian communities.\n\nBut Joe has made plenty of mistakes in the past and seems to be forgiven, so I don\u2019t think the racist angle of that answer is what will sink him. (If, indeed, he sinks at all.) The bigger issue, at least to me, was the mangled and meandering way that answer came out in real-time. Hugh sort of alluded to this aspect in his column, but let\u2019s look at some sections of the record player moment in detail.\n\n\u201cRedlining banks, making sure we are in a position where \u2014 look, you talk about education.\u201d\n\nThis was the first point where he got through half a thought about his own record and then, like a needle skipping over several grooves on a record (sorry), he jumped into a new topic. Continuing:\n\n\u201cNumber two, make sure that we bring in to help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home, we have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cproblems that come from home.\u201d He even repeated it. Then he veered off into a lack of school psychologists. (Not a problem caused at home.) Did he already sense he was getting into hot water? If so, it didn\u2019t stop him.\n\n\u201cThe teachers are \u2014 I\u2019m married to a teacher, my deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them.\u201d\n\nAgain, he starts a sentence, gets a few words into the thought and suddenly goes crashing off into something else. Repetitively. And then the wheels really come off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help. They don\u2019t \u2014 they don\u2019t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the \u2014 the \u2014 make sure that kids hear words.\u201d\n\nAs I mentioned above, you can clearly read some racism into that part of the answer if you wish. But it\u2019s the sentence structure that should be more alarming. It sounds like his train of thought was acting like a ping pong ball. Televisions, record players, making sure the kids hear words.\n\nI know we\u2019re not supposed to bring this subject up in polite society, and the President, along with the other frontrunner Democratic candidates are all septuagenarians. But that answer just sounded like the disjointed ramblings of somebody who is having a hard time mentally coloring inside the lines. By the time he was finished, I was unsure if he even remembered what question he was answering.\n\nThis is a delicate topic and I\u2019m not trying to be unkind to Biden or any of the rest of them. I\u2019ve nearly hit the age where I qualify for Social Security and I\u2019m already forgetting far too many things and having my share of senior moments, so I honestly do sympathize. And I also know that some people live to far greater ages than Biden and remain sharp as a tack. (I\u2019ll toss Bernie Sanders a bone here and say that I see no signs of his mental capacity flagging. He just has awful policies.)\n\nIn closing, if this record player answer lives on and comes back to significantly damage Biden, it\u2019s not going to be for the racism component. I think that rambling diatribe of an answer is going to be leaving a lot of voters guessing that Joe\u2019s mind just isn\u2019t what it once was and will only get worse over the next four or eight years. And that may not be a risk they\u2019re willing to take.", "description": "Too soon to tell", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/biden-bullets.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
