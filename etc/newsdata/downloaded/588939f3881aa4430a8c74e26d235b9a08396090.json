So People Are Shooting Them from Helicopters.", "language": "en", "text": "The helicopter doors are off, the hunters are in position, and the wild hog is running for its life. The pilot swings the chopper around so it\u2019s just a few feet off the ground.\n\n\u201cClear to fire! Clear to fire!\u201d\n\nWhen the hunters let loose on the hog, they're doing so largely for sport \u2014 but they're also helping Texas farmers take out a major pest.\n\nFeral hogs became an internet meme in August, when a tweet about shooting 30 to 50 hogs with a semi-automatic rifle went viral. What started as a debate around one of America\u2019s most polarizing topics \u2014 assault weapons \u2014 became many people\u2019s introduction to a very different problem: Feral hogs are one of the most destructive invasive species in the U.S.\n\nBut to Texans, feral hogs are nothing new \u2014 and they\u2019re no joke.\n\n\u201cThe problem is extremely serious,\u201d said Olivia Johnson, co-owner and business manager of helicopter outfit Cedar Ridge Aviation in Knox City, Texas. \u201cIt would be like if you woke up and there was 3 million rats living in your house. You wouldn't live with them. You wouldn't just say, \u2018Oh, well, welcome to my home.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe hogs are a menace to the environment and agriculture alike, and cause roughly $1.5 billion in damage each year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. They tear up crops and property, eat endangered species, and spread diseases to livestock and humans. The USDA estimates there are about 6 million hogs across the U.S., but some experts put the number closer to 9 million.\n\nRoughly half of the hogs live in Texas, where people can't kill them quickly enough to manage the population. So in 2011, the state made it legal for helicopter companies to take anyone \u2014 even tourists \u2014 hunting in the sky.\n\n\u201cHelicopter hunting is the quickest way to kill a bunch of pigs,\" Dustin Johnson, an owner and pilot at Cedar Ridge Aviation, said.\n\nNow, companies sell seats to thrill-seeking tourists for as much as $5,000 per person. Cedar Ridge charges about half that, and hosts guests from as far as Australia and China.\n\nOn the day VICE News visited, two hunters from Amarillo, Texas, killed 54 pigs in one go. Overall, helicopter hunting killed 43,000 pigs in the state last year, according to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. That\u2019s only about 1-2% of Texas\u2019s hog population.\n\nDustin Johnson acknowledges that some object to killing dozens of pigs from helicopters, and says those people have never fought the pig problem in Texas.\n\nBut Bubba Ortiz, a hog trapper in New Braunfels, Texas, isn\u2019t a fan of their approach.\n\n\u201cI'd prefer to take them alive than dead, because when they're dead, I want to do something with the meat,\u201d said Ortiz, a Pueblo Nation member with Tigua and Acoma Sky City heritage. He sends hogs to certified hunting ranches or to meat processors for shipment overseas, where wild boar is a more popular menu item.\n\nOrtiz said he trapped 417 hogs within the city limits of San Antonio in 2017, and another 300 in the county.\n\n\u201cI don't hate the pigs,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cI'm not a big fan of the pigs cause they're just so destructive. But I look at them like a good adversary.\u201d", "description": "Did someone say 30 to 50 feral hogs?
