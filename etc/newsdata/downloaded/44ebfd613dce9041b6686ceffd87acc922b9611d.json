REUTERS/Leon Neal/Pool/Files\n\nThe IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) showed the factory sector overall shrank for a fifth month in a row, its longest such run since mid-2009.\n\nBut the pace of contraction eased with the PMI\u2019s main gauge of activity rising to a four-month high of 48.3, helped by some companies accumulating stocks and buying more inputs for the first time in recent months.\n\nThe median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists had been for a fall to 47.0.\n\nBritain\u2019s economy grew strongly in the first three months of 2019 when factories rushed to stock up on parts and finished goods rather than face the risk of border disruptions after March 29, the original Brexit deadline.\n\nThe date of Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union was subsequently delayed until the end of October.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will make sure Brexit happens on Oct. 31. But lawmakers have approved a law requiring him to seek a new delay, if London and Brussels have not renegotiated a transition deal in time.\n\nMarkit said only consumer goods makers saw growth in September while investment goods were hard hit by uncertainty about the economy, which has been affected by the global slowdown as well as the lack of clarity about Brexit.\n\nStaffing levels fell at the fastest pace since February 2013, it said.\n\nManufacturing accounts for around 10% of Britain\u2019s economy. A PMI survey for the bigger services sector is due to be published on Thursday.", "description": "Some British manufacturers resumed stockpiling in September as they geared up for the latest Brexit deadline due on Oct. 31, a survey showed on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435815342&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902A4", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
