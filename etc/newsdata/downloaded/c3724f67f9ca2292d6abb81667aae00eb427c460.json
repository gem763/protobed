last four of the US Open Getty\n\nAnd while at 38, Federer's chances of adding to his tally are surely waning, the 33-year-old Nadal, fitness permitting, will almost inevitably collect a 13th French Open title next year.\n\nWhen Nadal raced two breaks ahead in the opening set, he could hardly have imagined it would take the best part of an hour to claim it. And the pattern was repeated in the second.\n\nNevertheless, Nadal wrapped up 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 victory to set up a semi-final against Italian 24th seed Matteo Berrettini.\n\n\"It was straight sets but a big challenge,\" Nadal said. \"To see myself in the situation to lose both breaks in a row was tough.\n\n\"But I'm super happy with the way I accepted the challenge. Here I am, semi-finals, it means everything to me.\n\n\"Physically I'm fine. Today was a heavy day, big humidity, and I sweat a lot. I had some big moments at the end of the second set and beginning of the third, but the last few games I felt good again.\n\n\"Berrettini? I saw him play. He has big serves, big forehands, and is super confident. He makes big steps forward every week so it will be a big challenge. But now is the moment to keep going.\"\n\nEarlier 23-year-old Berrettini beat 13th seed Gael Monfils in the match of the tournament so far, finally sealing victory in a fifth-set tiebreak, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 (5).\n\nBerrettini needed five match points to fall over the line, having double-faulted with his first at 5-3 in the fifth.\n\nIt became a mental battle with an exhausted Monfils also double-faulting time after time at the climax.\n\nHis fifth double fault, in the tiebreaker, gave Berrettini two serves to win it, but Monfils passed him to haul one mini-break back, and the Italian netted the second.\n\nBut Berrettini came out on top in a brutal rally to bring up two more match points.\n\nHe was aced with the first, but when Monfils hit a service return long, Berrettini dropped to the floor on the baseline in disbelief.\n\nBerrettini said: \"Right now I can't remember any points, just the match point - and the double fault!\n\n\"When I was playing I was thinking it was one of the best matches I had ever seen. I was playing, but I was watching, too. I'm really happy.\"\n\nPA", "description": "Rafael Nadal moved a step closer a fourth US Open\u00a0title with a straight-sets, but far from straightforward, win over Diego Schwartzman in their quarter-final at Flushing Meadows.
