I was touched by their stories,\" Lesufi said.\n\nThe school has been rocked by the allegations made by both current and past pupils, as well as parents.\n\nFormer pupil Sherizaad Akoo, 19, addressed the girls during an assembly and told her story, saying that she had been harassed by the teacher for five years.\n\nShe appealed to the pupils to be brave and come forward.\n\nThe investigation will be a joint operation by the Human Rights Commission, the Teddy Bear Clinic, the Gauteng Department of Basic Education and the SA Council of Educators.\n\nLesufi said additional allegations had been received by the South African Human Rights Commission, as well as a detailed report of the exchange of messages between the teacher and some of the pupils.\n\n\"We felt that they [SAHRC] should continue their investigation as well, because at least with them they have the power to subpoena,\" Lesufi said.\n\nThe department would cooperate with the investigation and provide all the information they required, he vowed.\n\n\"I\u2019m not an expert, but if you have those kinds of allegations, for somebody who has been working at the school for more than eight years, you tend to ask yourself what happened to other girls [who] went through the system?\" Lesufi said.\n\n\"If school premises are not the safest for our children as a society, we would have failed these girls.\"", "description": "A teacher at Queens High School in Johannesburg has been suspended pending an investigation amid allegations of sexual harassment, with Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi urging pupils to come forward to assist with the probe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9328/634d133bdc0a4377aefe4d7271636f01.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
