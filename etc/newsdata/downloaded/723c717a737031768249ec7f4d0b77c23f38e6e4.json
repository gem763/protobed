I didn't mean anything sexual, I just heard what was said to her and wanted to help. If it was anyone else this would never have gone to court. I accept I'm not liked by everyone.'\n\nHe continued: 'The last year has been a nightmare and I've worked hard to stay sober, in the last 6 months I've not touched a drop.'\n\nHe added: 'I've been in trouble but nothing like this. I worried people would stop me going down the high street and shout abuse at me, or stop me from being around their kids.'\n\nThe former Tottenham midfielder was accused of forcefully and sloppily kissing a stranger while he was drunk on a York to Durham train in August 2018.\n\nHe revealed he cried when he thought about being banned from seeing younger members of his family and would go on exercise binges at night to stop him from drinking (pictured alongside manager Katie Davies)\n\nGascoigne (pictured outside court) has restated that he only kissed the woman on a train in County Durham due to her being mocked for her weight\n\nTeesside Crown Court has heard the woman was on a York to Newcastle train on August 20, 2018, when Gascoigne, who she said was loud and swearing, sat down next to her, tapped her on the arm, grabbed her by the cheeks and planted a sloppy kiss on her lips.\n\nHe denied the charge, saying the kiss was not sexual and that he kissed the stranger to boost her confidence after he heard someone call her fat.\n\n'Gazza' claimed that after he was arrested at his \u00a3149-a-night hotel in Newcastle police spoke to him about his career and asked him for selfies, which was denied by the British Transport Police.\n\nHe was cleared at Teeside Crown Court on Thursday and was also found not guilty of the less serious charge of common assault.\n\nGascoigne said he feared being on the sexual offenders register and being compared to billionaire paedophile Epstein, who died while of trial for trafficking girls for sex.\n\nGascoigne said he feared being on the sexual offenders register and being compared to billionaire paedophile Epstein (pictured), who died while of trial for trafficking girls for sex\n\nHe told how the seriousness of it hit him six weeks before the trial and he 'just started crying', adding that he feared about not being able to be around children.\n\nIn a desperate bid to avoid returning to drinking, Gascoigne also took to 'all night sit-ups and squats or on the bike' to keep his head clear.\n\nIn his closing speech of the trial, prosecutor William Mousley QC insisted Gascoigne had repeatedly lied about what happened, and that someone had abused the woman.\n\nAfter she was kissed, the woman, who cannot be named, was shocked and a fellow passenger challenged Gascoigne, saying: 'What you have just done is sexual abuse.'\n\nPolice later traced Gascoigne to the hotel in Jesmond, Newcastle, and when an officer spoke to him on the phone, prior to arrest, the footballer said: 'I know what it's about, I kissed a fat lass.'\n\nWhen he gave evidence, Gascoigne said he was trying to reassure his alleged victim after he claimed to have overheard someone say of her: 'You don't want a photo with her, she's fat and ugly.'\n\nHe spoke of his own battle with his weight, struggles with bulimia and bullying suffered by family members.\n\nPaul Gascoigne leaves Teesside Crown Court in Middlesbrough with his manager Katie Davies on Thursday\n\nIn a statement read outside court by his solicitor Imogen Cox, Gascoigne said it had been 'tough' having the allegation hanging over him for a year\n\nGascoigne said that he came and sat next to the woman, telling her 'take no notice of what they say' and 'listen, you're not fat and ugly'.\n\nHe denied being drunk at the time, telling the jury he had undergone an operation in Australia to have pellets implanted in his stomach which would make him 'spew up' if he drank spirits.\n\nThe defence showed the jury pictures of Gascoigne kissing and being kissed by other people, including former footballers Steve Bull, Ian Wright, Ally McCoist and Wayne Rooney, as well Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nThe court heard character references from former boxers Ricky Hatton and Jane Couch, his alcohol therapist and his former agent Mel Stein, which spoke of Gascoigne frequently kissing people.\n\nMr Stein's statement recounted a time when Gascoigne kissed and hugged a rabbi's wife, but the potentially offensive moment was quickly forgiven due to the player's apology.\n\nJurors were shown photos of Gascoigne kissing celebrities, including Princess Diana in 1990, in an attempt to back up his claim that he often kissed people\n\nLeft, Gascoigne kissing Danny Baker and right, Gascoigne kissing Wayne Rooney\n\nThe incident happened on a York to Newcastle train at Darlington (pictured in file photo)\n\nWhen he was cleared, the former England player said he was 'looking forward to getting on with my life'.\n\nOutside court, he smiled and stood beside his solicitor Imogen Cox as she read a statement on his behalf, saying: 'To have a sexual allegation for over 12 months has been tough.\n\n'I am so glad I was finally able to put over my side of the story and that the jury came to the correct verdict.'\n\nMichelle Heeley QC, defending, had argued that when Gascoigne kissed the stranger, there was no sexual intent.\n\nShe said the former player kissed a woman who was not expecting it and did not like it, but that did not make him a sex offender.\n\nShe said the kiss lasted two or three seconds, on a packed train, and was not preceded by any 'lecherous comment', touching or groping.", "description": "The former England star claimed he was scared of being seen as 'worse than Jeffrey Epstein', the
