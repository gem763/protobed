I think that as a Republican party we have lost our way,\" he told Fox News on Sunday.\n\n\"We have lost our way on debts and deficits and spending... The president has called himself the king of debt, has a familiarity and comfort level with debt that I think is ultimately leading us in the wrong direction.\"\n\nIn April, former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld became the first person to challenge Mr Trump.\n\nHe was followed by conservative radio host and former lawmaker Joe Walsh at the end of August.\n\nWho is Mark Sanford?\n\nHe first served in Congress in 1995, representing South Carolina's first congressional district. He later served as the state's governor for two terms from 2003-2011. He then returned to the House in 2013.\n\nMr Sanford criticised Mr Trump during the 2016 presidential election but ultimately supported him. However he would become one of his toughest Republican critics in Congress when Mr Trump took office.\n\nThat stance cost him the Republican primary when his seat was up for re-election last year. He was beaten by a pro-Trump challenger who went on to lose the election to her Democrat opponent.\n\nHe is known as a fiscal conservative and has been attacked by Mr Trump over an extra-marital affair that tainted his second term as governor.\n\nHe went missing for several days, with his staff telling reporters he had gone to hike the Appalachian Trail. He had instead gone to Argentina to see his mistress, which he later confessed.\n\nWho will take on Trump in 2020?\n\nElection day is still more than a year away but the race to become the Democratic challenger to Mr Trump is already well under way.\n\nJoe Biden and Bernie Sanders have thrown their hats into the ring, but most of the other candidates are relatively unknown outside the Washington DC bubble.\n\nFind out who is already running and who might join them.", "description": "Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and fiscal hawk, says the party has lost its way.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/840E/production/_108660833_471155fb-6103-4511-ad0c-da5a1ac6745d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
