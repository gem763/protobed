The probe is examining whether a payment to former adult-film star Stormy Daniels\u2014and the way the Trump Organization recorded the reimbursement of that payment\u2014violated a state law that bars falsifying business records, according to the person.\n\nA spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, which is conducting the investigation, declined to comment.\n\nMarc Mukasey, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said, \u201cWe are evaluating our options, taking a look at the situation and we\u2019ll respond in due course.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the accounting firm, Mazars USA, said in a statement that the company would \u201crespect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations.\u201d She said it is the firm\u2019s policy not to comment on work it does for clients.\n\nThe subpoena was reported earlier by the New York Times.\n\nAn investigation by Manhattan state prosecutors into the president\u2019s role in hush-money payments has escalated since the federal investigation into those payments\u2014which sent former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen to prison in May\u2014concluded this summer. Investigators from the district attorney\u2019s office met with Mr. Cohen this summer, the person familiar with the matter said.\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Cohen didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn August 2018, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to charges including violating campaign-finance law by arranging hush-money payments during the 2016 election to two women who alleged they had affairs with Mr. Trump. He has said he did so at Mr. Trump\u2019s behest, an assertion that was confirmed by federal prosecutors in a court filing last year.\n\nMr. Trump has denied wrongdoing.\n\nUntil this summer, federal prosecutors in Manhattan probed the possible involvement of others at the Trump Organization in Mr. Cohen\u2019s campaign-finance violations. They haven\u2019t disclosed any indictments of any executives at the company.\n\nFederal prosecutors said in a charging document for Mr. Cohen that the Trump Organization accounted for reimbursement checks to him for the payments as \u201clegal expenses,\u201d when, in fact, there was no such retainer agreement. The reimbursement Mr. Cohen sought was \u201cnot in connection with any legal services he had provided,\u201d prosecutors have said.\n\nJustice Department policy bars the indictment of a sitting president.\n\nThe subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is the latest chapter in a multipronged effort by investigators to obtain the president\u2019s financial information.\n\nThe House Intelligence and Financial Services committees in April subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for documents and financial records\u2014including tax returns\u2014related to Mr. Trump, his children and various business entities they own spanning the last decade. Deutsche Bank told a federal appeals court last month that it has copies of tax returns sought under that subpoena.\n\nIn July, the House Ways and Means Committee sued the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service for the president\u2019s tax returns. In a separate dispute, the president sued that committee and New York state officials in an attempt to block his state tax returns from being turned over to the panel.\n\nMr. Trump in 2016 broke with four decades of precedent for presidential candidates in declining to release his tax returns.\n\nWrite to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com and Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "description": "State prosecutors in Manhattan have subpoenaed eight years of President Trump\u2019s tax returns as part of a probe into whether a payment to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels violated a law against falsifying business records.", "authors": ["Corinne Ramey", "Rebecca Ballhaus", "Corinne.Ramey Wsj.Com", "Rebecca.Ballhaus Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107609/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
