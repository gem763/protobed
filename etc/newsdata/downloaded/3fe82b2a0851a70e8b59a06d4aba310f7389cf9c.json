California is a particularly attractive target for Mr. Trump and Mr. Wheeler because the state has stoutly resisted the administration\u2019s recent attempts to loosen car emissions rules.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Post\u2019s Juliet Eilperin, Brady Dennis and Josh Dawsey report that \u201cabout three dozen other states also have counties that failed to meet national benchmarks for air pollution. And last year, the EPA estimated that 3,508 community water systems were out of compliance with health standards.\u201d Yet California is the only one to receive such threats.\n\nOn most days, Mr. Trump is promoting policies and officials who are hostile to clean air and water, and that includes Mr. Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist. This team has sided against state and federal efforts to address pollution of all sorts. The EPA revoked California\u2019s ability to set car pollution standards. It has rolled back federal water oversight. The notion that Mr. Trump or Mr. Wheeler cares about California\u2019s pollution issues does not pass the laugh test. They are using what tools they have to harass a state that has resisted Mr. Trump and his EPA\u2019s deregulatory agenda.\n\nWhere are the conservative critics now that the EPA is actually out of control?\n\nRead more:\n\nRobert Redford: Don\u2019t let Trump pollute our lakes and streams\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: The White House should compromise with California on fuel efficiency standards\n\nCatherine Rampell: Trump\u2019s plan for the economy: Make Drinking Water Dirty Again\n\nLetter to the Editor: Under Trump\u2019s new water policy, polluters win\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger: Trump can\u2019t erase a decade of clean air progress with a Sharpie\n\nAD", "description": "Trump\u2019s EPA has declared regulatory war on California.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XE5a-aQvyylbqiTBRWfdiSIIyXk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/47FH33HBQQI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
