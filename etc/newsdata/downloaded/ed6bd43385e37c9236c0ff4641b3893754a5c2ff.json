There is a big upside for the UK economy,\u201d he added.\n\nDescribed by Politico as an \u201ceco-warrior\u201d, Mr Carney, a Canadian, produced a 2015 report together with former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg advising all listed companies to disclose any risk they face from climate change in their annual financial filings.\n\nThe report was drafted by the Financial Stability Board\u2019s (FSB) Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD), set up by Carney.\n\nMuch of the potential gains and losses companies face will be dictated by the actions of attentive investors, Carney proposed, since ethically engaged investors will want to back winners.\n\n\u201cThere will be industries, sectors and firms that do very well during this process because they will be part of the solution,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there will also be ones that lag behind and they will be punished.\u201d\n\nCarney pointed to U.S. coal companies as an example, saying they had already lost 90 percent of their value, but added that banks were also at risk.\n\n\u201cJust like in any other major structural change, those banks overexposed to the sunset sectors will suffer accordingly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether the transition is smooth or is it something that is delayed and then happens very abruptly. That is an open question,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThe longer the adjustment is delayed in the real economy, the greater the risk that there is a sharp adjustment.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian has taken a proactive role in advocating activism against climate change. In a note to readers Sunday, the newspaper said that as the crisis in our natural world escalates, \u201cwe refuse to turn away from the climate catastrophe and species extinction.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor The Guardian, reporting on the environment is a priority,\u201d the note reads. \u201cWe give reporting on climate, nature and pollution the prominence it deserves, stories which often go unreported by others in the media.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this pivotal time for our species and our planet, we are determined to inform readers about threats, consequences and solutions based on scientific facts, not political prejudice or business interests,\u201d it said.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Bank of England governor Mark Carney has threatened environmentally inactive companies with bankruptcy in his drive to tackle climate change.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
