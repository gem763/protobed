Now, the Baltic city of Vilnius is preparing for its own potential real-life atomic catastrophe.\n\nThe Lithuanian capital is on edge over the imminent opening of a nuclear-power facility just 40 kilometers (25 miles) away in Belarus. Following a string of incidents during construction \u2014 and attempts to conceal them \u2014 many deem the Russian-built Astravets plant unsafe.\n\nThe government is buying 900,000 euros ($1 million) of iodine tablets in the event of a radiation leak, which could affect a third of Lithuania\u2019s 2.8 million population. Nationwide drills will be held to test readiness should the unthinkable happen.\n\n\u201cEverything you saw on the Chernobyl TV series will be here: the sirens, the rescuers and the helicopters,\u201d said Edgaras Geda, head of Civil Protection Board, which is organizing the exercises. \u201cPeople still remember Chernobyl. Many of our relatives, including my uncles, were sent to the rescue missions so we have first-hand experience. We\u2019re not going to guess whether an accident could happen, we\u2019re getting ready for one.\u201d\n\nThe four-day drills will start Oct. 1 and involve a Chernobyl-like scenario where a nuclear accident at Astravets sends out a radioactive cloud helicopters monitor. Sirens will sound, warning messages will be sent to all mobile phones and the national broadcaster will report on the disaster. In some areas, rescuers and the military will evacuate. In others, volunteers playing victims will be registered, washed and given fresh clothing before being taken to safe locations for medical tests and food.\n\nAstravets\u2019s safety record is the concern. Since construction began in 2012, there have been at least three deaths. Lithuania is worried about transparency, with some incidents initially going undisclosed, including when the 330-ton casing for the plant\u2019s atomic core slipped from a crane and plunged to the ground.\n\nThe 2,400-megawatt facility\u2019s two reactors are being built by the export arm of Russia\u2019s state-run Rosatom Corp., which also has projects in Turkey, China and Finland. It\u2019s the same company that oversaw Russia\u2019s failed nuclear-missile test on Aug. 8. Five scientists were killed in that incident. Radiation levels spiked in the White Sea near the Arctic Circle.\n\nRussia is providing the lion\u2019s share of Astravets\u2019s $11 billion cost via loans and will be the sole supplier of fuel. Lithuania, once part of the USSR and ruled from Moscow, refuses to purchase the electricity and wants its neighbors to refrain too.\n\nFor some in Vilnius, memories of the blast at the Chernobyl reactor in Ukraine more than 30 years ago \u2014 along with Soviet efforts to cover it up \u2014 are all too fresh. Residents will get a refresher this month when the whole of HBO\u2019s miniseries is screened in a local stadium.\n\nVilnius, Lithuania. Getty Images\n\n\u201cI clearly remember the day Chernobyl exploded, it\u2019s very disturbing,\u201d said Ona Rimkiene, a retired nurse. \u201cPower plants are generally scary, but it\u2019s scarier how close this one is.\u201d\n\nBelarus, which plans to deliver the first fuel to Astravets by Oct. 1, denies safety problems. Even so, it ignored international recommendations after the 2011 Fukushima disaster to stop building nuclear plants within 100 kilometers of major cities.\n\nLithuania has long complained to Europe about the threat \u2014 not least because Astravets is built on land with heightened seismic risks.\n\n\u201cGermany supports Lithuania that higher safety criteria must be met,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel told her Lithuanian counterpart at a news conference last month.\n\nFor now, Lithuania is monitoring radiation along the Belarus border and in the river that passes Astravets before reaching Vilnius. A leak could contaminate drinking water for the city\u2019s 540,000 residents.\n\n\u201cThe probability of nuclear accidents is low,\u201d said Sandra Norbutaite, head of public safety in Vilnius. \u201cBut the consequences are catastrophic. It\u2019s best to be prepared.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Vilnius the Lithuanian capital, is on edge over the opening of the Russian-built Astravets power plant just 40 kilometers away in Belarus", "authors": ["Milda Seputyte"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/lithuania-russia-astravets-nuclear-plant.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1"}
