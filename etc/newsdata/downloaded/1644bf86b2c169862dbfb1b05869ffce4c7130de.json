And it\u2019s shifted into uncomfortable territory \u2013 culpability for our planet\u2019s malaise is crossing into the domain of personal lifestyle. Your lifestyle.\n\nI think the turning point was late last year in Poland. That\u2019s when and where Sir David Attenborough opened the proceedings at the COP24 conference, the international conclave of climate change specialists. Excerpting from his speech, he told the audience that the \u201cworld\u2019s people\u201d are \u201c\u2026 willing to make sacrifices in their daily lives,\u201d and that \u201c\u2026 they recognize that they too must play their part,\u201d in arresting climate change.\n\nAchieving the deep emission reductions scoped out in the Paris Agreement will require mandatory sacrifices in everyone\u2019s daily lives\n\nInterpretation: You will think twice about driving your kids to hockey in an SUV; forget about flying to Disneyland for a family vacation; become a vegan and move into nothing larger than a studio apartment.\n\nI\u2019m not being facetious nor am I disparaging Attenborough. Run the numbers and you\u2019ll see that achieving the deep emission reductions scoped out in the Paris Agreement \u2014 or the more aggressive net-zero targets pledged by more than 70 countries \u2014 will require mandatory sacrifices in everyone\u2019s daily lives.\n\nIn economics parlance we\u2019re now talking about the \u201cdemand side\u201d of the equation. Hitherto, focusing attention on fossil fuel suppliers was the one-sided strategy. Unfortunately, simplistic narratives like \u201cthe end of oil is nigh,\u201d led the populace to believe they didn\u2019t have to be part of the climate change solution.\n\nThe world is neither simple nor one-dimensional \u2014 \u201cit takes two to tango\u201d as they say. Supply and demand can\u2019t be separated in economics.\n\nSo, now the spotlight is shining on consumers. People like you and me, in addition to industrial emitters, are also responsible for making final decisions about energy use. Turning an ignition key, flicking a light switch, firing up a comfy gas fireplace, turning up a thermostat, buying a plane ticket, taking a cruise, buying a new vehicle are all personal decisions about emitting greenhouse gases.\n\nHeck, even the Royal Family has to change their behaviour. Environmental spokespersons Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex were recently shamed for taking a private jet to Elton John\u2019s chateaux in France. Yes, things are getting uncomfortable for the aristocracy. But what about the rest of us plebeians?\n\nHer symbolic voyage across the Atlantic is finally exposing the deeply entrenched comfort we all derive from fossil fuels\n\nEnter Greta Thunberg, an articulate Swedish teenager and climate activist. Appropriately, she shunned a trans-Atlantic flight and traveled to New York by sailboat to rally hearts and minds on climate change action. Now a global icon, she has stoked the minds of youthful millions. Their goal: To get policy makers around the world to implement really tough medicine to cut emissions.\n\nControversial to say the least, Ms. Thunberg has been an unfortunate lighting-rod for nasty criticism. Personally, I\u2019m not bothered. Her symbolic voyage across the Atlantic is finally exposing the deeply entrenched comfort we all derive from fossil fuels. Implicitly, she\u2019s demonstrating how incredibly hard it is to shake our addiction to a ubiquitous commodity like oil (although I think this connection has yet sink into the minds of many who support her position).\n\nThe new message is clear: Policy action must go well beyond transitioning industry. Peoples of the world, pushed by government, must also personally contribute \u2014 through deeds and dollars \u2014 to solving the problem.\n\nBut is the public ready for such rapid change? Under a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d we\u2019re told we only have 10 years. Yet under any realistic scenario this is not enough time to reduce emissions without cutting back on consumption.\n\nSo, are we, the \u201cworld\u2019s people\u201d really \u201cwilling\u201d to give up things like flights to our favourite vacation spots as Attenborough obliquely posits? Are hundreds of millions of newly minted middle-class people in Asia willing to stay at home now that they have crossed a threshold of wealth to give them their first taste of mobility and holidays in the sun?\n\nI don\u2019t think I need to show the trend data. Traveling the planet; driving obese vehicles; buying useless, over-packaged goods that are delivered to our door \u2014 these are comforts that billions of people around the world want in increasing excess.\n\nEnglish writer Aldous Huxley, author of notable works like Brave New World, wrote an obscure essay in 1927 simply called Comfort, a treatise on the benefits of energy use (like hot baths). He wrote, \u201cThe more comfort is brought into the world, the more it is likely to be valued. To those who have known comfort, discomfort is a real torture.\u201d\n\nThe realization is finally setting in that the business of energy is everyone\u2019s business\n\nMillions of Thunberg followers are calling for change. But taking a few hours off work, holding a placard and chanting at politicians is the easy part. Going the next step and enduring personal discomfort for the greater good is the big leap that\u2019s needed to walk the talk.\n\nYes, a new narrative has emerged. Ala Huxley, we\u2019ll see how much \u201creal torture\u201d comfy consumers will be willing to tolerate to reduce emissions. Technology and business interests can only do so much, so fast. To go faster, the rest will be up to the world\u2019s people and politicians who must decide how to govern their citizens\u2019 lives and wallets.\n\nThe realization is finally setting in that the business of energy is everyone\u2019s business. We can thank Greta Thunberg for changing the narrative and exposing that important reality.\n\nPeter Tertzakian is Executive Director of the ARC Energy Research Institute in Calgary, Alberta.", "description": "Peter Tertzakian: The climate change narrative has shifted into uncomfortable territory \u2014 your lifestyle", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/greta-new.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
