Remember the famous comic-cuts test tube cartoon which Netanyahu held before the UN, a symbol of the time it would take for the Islamic Republic to create a nuclear weapon? Iran must be \u201cdefanged\u201d, I believe the words were; nuclear Islamist tyrant must be disarmed.\n\nAnd there we were this week, with the Iranian beast actually firing at Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil plants \u2013 although I noted the Saudi claim that the attack was \u201cunquestionably sponsored\u201d (a big \u201csic\u201d there) by Iran. In other words, it was the Houthis what done it but the Iranians who were behind it.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The Brits lost the tanker war when Iran\u2019s vessel turned up off the Syrian port of Banias. And what of Trump? Not much of a whizz-bang, was it, to tell the world that increased sanctions against Iran would be unveiled \u201cwithin 48 hours\u201d \u2013 quite a while for Trump\u2019s guys to fiddle their fingers \u2013 and that \u201cthere are many options\u201d.\n\nOne option for Trump, now he knows Netanyahu\u2019s fate, would be to turn on the Saudis, whose intelligence men chopped off poor Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s head a year ago and did other unmentionable things to him before \u2013 let us speak frankly \u2013 disposing of him down a consulate drain, fountain or sink. Just what did the Saudi crown prince know about this abysmal, disgraceful affair? And let me add another question: was Khashoggi\u2019s face turned towards Mecca when he was buried? Perhaps Mike Pompeo could actually ask Mohamed bin Salman, smiling broadly when he met him on Wednesday, what he knows about this gruesome killing of a very old friend of mine?\n\nBut that\u2019s unkind. The Saudis are our allies \u2013 the Brits, remember, are still sponsoring them \u2013 and they tell us that the drone strikes by the Houthis/Iranians were \u201ca test of global will\u201d. And was our response to Khashoggi\u2019s murder also a test of global will?\n\nNot that I want to smooth Iran\u2019s feathers, its hangings and tortures and injustices. But I was surprised, these hot few days in the Middle East, that no one \u2013 not Iran, not America, nor the Israelis \u2013 remembered that this week marked the 37th anniversary of the Sabra and Chatila massacre: an abhorrence created by Israel\u2019s Christian militia allies in Lebanon, the slaughter of 1,700 mostly Palestinians in the refugee camps to which they were sent by an Israeli right-wing Likud minister in 1982. Yes, the same Likud party for which Netanyahu has probably just lost the Israeli election.\n\nI am always struck by these anniversaries \u2013 how we forget them, how not a single president or prime minister or king came to the drab, tangled, overgrown cemetery where those men, women and children lie dead in West Beirut. I still recall their black countenances, the stench, the vileness of the mass graves over which I walked. Just a few days ago I passed by there in my taxi, and was deeply shocked to find that I had totally forgotten them too.\n\nBack then, in 1982, Beirut was known as a \u201ccapital of terror\u201d. A small army of suicide bombers had already, by 1983, unleashed themselves at the US embassy and the American Marines and the French paratroopers.\n\nDirected by Iran? Inspired by Iran? That country with which the Americans and the Europeans and the Russians managed to achieve a nuclear agreement?\n\nHeaven spare us from the enemies we turned into friends, and who are now enemies again \u2013 and from the ally who chopped off the head of one of my colleagues.\n\nThere are many options, the American president now tells us. Indeed there are.", "description": "There is an extraordinary irony in the fate of both Benjamin Netanyahu and Iran.
