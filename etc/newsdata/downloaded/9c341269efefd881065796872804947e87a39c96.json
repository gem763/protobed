Jackson ) to work with a new hero, Mysterio/Quentin Beck ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) to fight the inter-dimensional threat known as the Elementals.\n\nOne of the key locations for some of these epic dust-ups is in and around the city of Prague in the Czech Republic, where the Sony Pictures production filmed on location and utilised some of the city's cultural landmarks to create a picturesque battleground for Peter to fight in.\n\nMirror Online looked at how the production brought the city to life on film.\n\nSpider-Man Far From Home on location in Prague\n\n(Image: Lewis Knight)\n\nThe film saw the group stay at the majestic Carlo IV Hotel in Prague, thanks to having some strings pulled by \"Nick Fury\".\n\nThe hotel itself is situated close to Prague Railway station and was once a bank building and even still contains its impressive vault.\n\nThe building was previously used a consulate in an early sequence in The Bourne Identity, starring Matt Damon.\n\nAnother plus side of the upgrade that Peter and the gang got was when - to their chagrin - they attended the opera at the historic Vinohrady Theatre , where Tom Holland and Zendaya filmed on location.\n\n(Image: SONY PICTURES)\n\nSadly, Peter had to flee to fight the Elementals before enjoying the performance, but MJ and then Ned and Betty were in hot pursuit.\n\nThe sequence that follows sees a battle with the Elementals and Spider-Man interrupt the celebrations for the 'Festival of Lights' in Prague city centre.\n\nThis festival is fictional but bears similarities with carnival festivals across the world mixed with Prague's real-life Signal Festival , an annual event in the city that utilises light art to colourful effect.\n\n(Image: SONY PICTURES)\n\nCreative projection shows are displayed on the face of city buildings and landmarks with multi-dimensional effects to charm onlookers - and feels oddly close to the kind of holograms utilised by Mysterio/Quentin Beck in the film.\n\nFor the festival in the film, the production filmed scenes close to Charles Bridge in Prague, but primarily in the city of Liberec , less than two hours north of the Czech capital.\n\nIt was here that the crew constructed a fairground, fountain, and new front-face to the city's large town hall for the huge action sequence.\n\n(Image: Gallo Images)\n\nFinally, one of the most memorable and heartwarming moments in the city occurs when Peter discovers that MJ has deduced his other life of Spider-Man all by herself, just before the pair discover the nefarious intentions of Peter's friend and ally, Quentin Beck.\n\nThis pivotal scene was filmed on the city's world-famous Charles Bridge, which crosses the Vltava River that runs through the city.\n\nIt was constructed under the rule of King Charles IV in 1357 and was finished in the early 15th Century. Originally called Stone Bridge, it got its new name in 1870.\n\nBefore long the gang in the film moved on to new European locations, but the film certainly left a mark on the city.\n\nFor another look at the filming in Prague, check out the video above.\n\nEmploying visual effects\n\n(Image: SONY PICTURES)\n\nDespite mostly employing practical effects and beautiful production design across Prague, whilst also filming the city's beauty itself, there was also the amazing addition of startling - and psychedelic - computer generation for some of the battle scenes.\n\nSpeaking to Mirror Online, visual artist Brian Carney from The Third Floor who worked on the film, revealed the process behind bringing Far From Home to life.\n\nCarney revealed: \"Artists from The Third Floor\u2019s UK office supported European filming, mostly done in London.\n\n\"By working with the filmmakers to visualize shots ahead of production and during additional photography, we were able to help map out camera placements, distances of objects to camera and other logistics in advance for a more informed shoot in real-world locations.\n\n\"Our pre-vis team visualized shots and flow of action early in the process with director Jon Watts, and our post-vis team worked with VFX Supervisor Janek Sirrs to produce versions of shots based on photographed plates.\n\n\"In mapping out some of the London shots, we looked at things like how Spider-Man might use landmarks like Tower Bridge as part of the fight.\"\n\nThe team worked closely with director Jon Watts on visualising the action and story as 3D shots and this was a core part of the film's creative process.\n\n(Image: Columbia Pictures)\n\nCarney spoke about how closely The Third Floor has worked with the MCU movies, and which was his favourite.\n\n\"The Third Floor has been the visualization team on so many movies,\" he said, \"including Spider-Man: Homecoming\u200b.\n\n\"While I worked on projects like Avengers: Endgame\u200b and Guardians of the Galaxy,\u200b it was my first time personally contributing to a Spider-Man film. Spider-Man was my favorite superhero growing up so it was especially fun and gratifying.\"\n\nImportantly, will Carney be working on some of the upcoming Marvel movies such as the confirmed Spider-Man: Far From Home sequel?\n\n(Image: YOUTUBE/SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT)\n\n\"We have a lot of experience working in the universe of these characters,\" teased Carney, \"and are collaborating on several projects coming up.\"\n\nWhatever they are, let's home they come close to matching the visuals of Spider-Man: Far From Home.\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home is available to Buy & Keep from Sky Store and is released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 11, 2019.\n\nCoverage was aided by Czech Tourism.\n\nAre you a Spider-Man fan?
