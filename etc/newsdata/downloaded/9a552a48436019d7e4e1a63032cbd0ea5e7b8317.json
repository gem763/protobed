Within hours, Turkish forces were killing Kurdish men, women and children, and hundreds of ISIS terrorists were pouring out of prisons amid the chaos (smoke rises over a northeast Syrian border town at the center of the fight between Turkey and Kurdish forces early Friday)\n\nWithin hours, Turkish forces were killing Kurdish men, women and children, and hundreds of ISIS terrorists were pouring out of prisons amid the chaos.\n\nIt signaled a terrible betrayal of people who had so recently fought alongside America to defeat a common enemy.\n\nFor all his absurd triumphalism over a desperately sought four-day pause in the shocking violence \u2013 a truce that\u2019s reportedly already been broken - Trump got played by Erdogan.\n\nAnd the president\u2019s childish \u2018I\u2019ll destroy your economy, you devilish fool\u2019 threats in that now infamous letter to his counterpart \u2013 one that Erdogan contemptuously dismissed by throwing it away - were an embarrassment to him and his country.\n\nThe horrendous mistake has exposed Trump\u2019s main weaknesses \u2013 a susceptibility to being manipulated by \u2018strongman\u2019 dictators, a refusal to listen to expert advice (everyone warned him it would be a disaster), a lack of clear strategic planning and a trash-talking diplomatic style better suited to the Apprentice boardroom than when deciding the fate of people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u2018Like two kids in a lot, you have got to let them fight,\u2019 Trump quipped on stage last night, \u2018and then you pull them apart.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more insensitive analogy given that many kids have literally been killed in the fighting.\n\nBack home, things have been no better; Trump\u2019s faced increasing impeachment pressure over his dealings with Ukraine, and that pressure massively intensified yesterday when his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney all but confirmed there WAS a \u2018quid pro quo\u2019 surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless they helped, with a Justice Department investigation into alleged Ukrainian corruption in America\u2019s 2016 election involving a DNC server.\n\n\u2018I was involved with the process by which money was held up temporarily, OK? Mulvaney told reporters at a White House briefing. \u2018Three issues for that: corruption in the country, whether or not other countries were participating in support of the Ukraine and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice. That\u2019s completely legitimate.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s also pretty much exactly the smoking gun impeachment campaigners have been hunting.\n\nAfter the briefing, all hell broke loose as first the Justice Department denied any knowledge of any connection between aid to Ukraine and the department\u2019s investigation, and then Jay Sekulow, the president\u2019s legal counsel, issued a terse statement saying he\u2019d had no involvement in Mulvaney\u2019s bombshell revelation.\n\nGeneral James \u2018Mad Dog\u2019 Mattis, Trump\u2019s former defense secretary, launched a similarly withering assault on his old boss. He spoke out after Trump told a meeting of members of Congress at the White House on Wednesday that Mattis was \u2018the world\u2019s most overrated general\u2019, \u2018wasn\u2019t tough enough,\u2019 and went onto say: \u2018I captured ISIS' (pictured at the 74th Annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, Thursday)\n\nLater, Mulvaney walked back his comments, saying \u2018there was never any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server.\u2019\n\nSorry, what? We heard that condition from Mulvaney\u2019s own mouth, and he said he was personally involved in the process of implementing that condition.\n\nWhat a fiasco, and what a dangerous development for President Trump.\n\nMany Republicans have turned on him this week, voting in Congress against his decision to withdraw troops from Syria.\n\nNow the main allegation of the proposed impeachment seems to have been confirmed by the man running the White House staff.\n\nYet the person really to blame is Trump himself, for making that ridiculously dumb phone call to Ukraine\u2019s President Zelensky in the first place, then brazenly admitting it and saying he wanted China to get digging dirt on his US election opponents too.\n\nTo make this week even more difficult, the president has also been savagely attacked in the past 24 hours by two of America\u2019s most respected military heroes.\n\nFirst, retired Admiral William McRaven, the man who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden, accused Trump of destroying America.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s undermined the intelligence community,\u2019 he said, \u2018the law enforcement community, the Department of Justice, the State Department. He has called the press the enemy of the American people and I will tell you, I\u2019ve fought a lot of America\u2019s enemies \u2013 the press is not the enemy of the American people. He\u2019s undermined our NATO allies, taken out of the JCPOA (Iran nuclear agreement) and the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal) and really the international community has lost faith in America. And then through the course of all this, he\u2019s convinced he\u2019s doing it all for the right reasons and that is really what is troubling.\u2019\n\nMcRaven, who was particularly enraged that Trump has \u2018left our allies the Kurds on the battlefield... betrayed them\u2019, concluded in an op-ed for the New York Times: \u2018If this president doesn\u2019t demonstrate the leadership that America needs, both domestically and abroad, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office, Republican, Democrat or Independent \u2013 the sooner the better. The fate of our Republic depends on it.\u2019\n\nWow.\n\nRetired Admiral William McRaven, the man who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden, accused Trump of destroying America\n\nA few hours later, at a dinner in New York, General James \u2018Mad Dog\u2019 Mattis, Trump\u2019s former defense secretary, launched a similarly withering assault on his old boss.\n\nHe spoke out after Trump told a meeting of members of Congress at the White House on Wednesday that Mattis was \u2018the world\u2019s most overrated general\u2019, \u2018wasn\u2019t tough enough,\u2019 and went onto say: \u2018I captured ISIS.\u2019\n\nMattis, who left the administration because Trump didn\u2019t agree with his vehement pleas for U.S. forces to remain in Syria to stop ISIS resurging, taunted back: \u2018I\u2019m honored to be considered the most overrated general by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress. So I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals, and frankly that sounds pretty good to me. You have to admit that between me and Meryl, at least we\u2019ve had some victories.\u2019\n\nOuch.\n\nAfter a series of other lacerating zingers, Mattis got serious and paraphrased a speech made by Abraham Lincoln in 1838 in which Lincoln said great nations crumble for one of two reasons, either foreign invasion or, \u2018the corrosion from within, the rot, the viciousness, the lassitude, the ignorance. Anarchy is one potential consequence of all this. The other is the rise of an ambitious leader, unfettered by conscience, or precedent or decency, who would make himself supreme.\u2019\n\nPresident Trump will doubtless react to the criticism from McRaven and Mattis as he does to all such criticism \u2013 very badly, very personally, and very abusively.\n\nBut denigrating America\u2019s greatest military leaders in the same week you\u2019ve committed one of the worst acts of military betrayal on your allies is not a good look.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s a shameful look.\n\nAnd talking of looks, it\u2019s time to take a good long hard look at yourself in the mirror, Mr President.\n\nWhat kind of leader do you really want to be?\n\nBecause if it\u2019s one that insults U.S. war heroes, betrays courageous allies, jokes about kids fighting as real kids are dying, and only helps countries in need if they dig up dirt on your election opponents, then Admiral McRaven\u2019s right: America needs someone else in the White House.", "description": "PIERS MORGAN: It's time to take a good long hard look at yourself in the mirror, Mr President.
