In the past, students had to retake the entire exam. Colleges will see all of the student\u2019s scores from a single sitting and any additional scores from retakes that students want to include.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re introducing the flexibility of students to improve on the areas where they didn\u2019t do so well,\u201d said Suzana Delanghe, the ACT\u2019s chief commercial officer. \u201cWe believe that this will help a lot of students.\u201d\n\nNearly half of students take the test more than once, she said. The change is based on feedback from students, parents, teachers, counselors, administrators and higher-education officials, she said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you think ACT changes will affect, if at all, the SAT exam? Join the conversation below.\n\nCollege entrance exams are facing greater scrutiny in the wake of the national college-admissions scandal, in which college counselor William \u201cRick\u201d Singer arranged to correct clients\u2019 answers on the ACT and SAT, among other steps, to gain admission to elite schools for his clients.\n\nTwo parents who have pleaded guilty are scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday in federal court in Boston. Marcia Abbott, of Aspen, Colo., and her husband Gregory Abbott, the founder of a food-and-beverage packaging company, pleaded guilty to paying $50,000 to have a proctor correct their daughter\u2019s ACT exam and $75,000 to have the same proctor clean up her SAT.\n\nACT officials said the change isn\u2019t in response to the scandal and had been under consideration for the past couple of years.\n\nACT officials said this is the first time in the test\u2019s 60-year history that students will be able to retake individual sections\u2014English, math, reading, science and writing.\n\nThe ACT and SAT are longtime rivals. In 2018, the number of SAT test takers surged past the ACT for the first time in seven years. And last month, SAT officials announced a record, that 2.2 million 2019 graduates took the exam, up from 2.1 million. The ACT said it plans to disclose its 2019 results next week.\n\nUnder the changes, the ACT also will provide universities with an aggregation of a student\u2019s best section scores to form the highest possible composite score. The method, known as superscoring, is already used by some colleges. The ACT said its research suggests that superscoring is more predictive of how students will perform in college courses than other scoring methods. Students will still have to provide scores from a single sitting of testing, which can be their best one, and can provide any retest scores.\n\nThe ACT also plans to expand options to take the test online on national test dates, offering students the ability to get their results in two days, rather than about two weeks. The online option, already used by some states and school districts that administer the test to all students, will be available at select test centers before expanding to all.\n\nJayne Caflin Fonash, president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, said it is good that a student could retest to bring up a low score without redoing the whole exam. But she cautioned that a student with a near-perfect score on a section could waste time on a retake to achieve a perfect score. Instead they would make better use of their time on studies or volunteer work, she said.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is for a student to be able to review these new options from ACT with a school counselor and make the best informed decision,\u201d Ms. Fonash said.\n\n\u2014Jennifer Levitz contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Tawnell D.
