They have been spectacular in the 6-and-12 month period following those decisions by the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLPL data show that the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.10% has been up 10% a half-year later and 20% a year out, gauged by three initial 25 basis point cuts in 1975, 1996, and 1998.\n\nThat may be hard to fathom considering the loftiness of equity gains this year. So far, the S&P 500 index is up 21.3% in the year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.04% is up 16.14%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.13% has advanced nearly 25% over the past 10 months.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen periods of economic slowdowns that had three consecutive 25 basis point cuts, most recently in the mid- and late 1990s,\u201d said LPL\u2019s senior market strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe good news is the economy accelerated after the slowdowns and stocks did quite as well.\u201d he said.\n\nOf course, gains for the U.S. stock market this year may make it difficult for the Fed to rationalize a third cut.\n\nAnd if a cut is delivered on Wednesday, how the Fed communicates what happens next could do a lot in helping to influence investor sentiment, notes the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Nick Timiraos. The WSJ said the Fed will be walking a tightrope in leaving its options open to further rate cuts, in this \u201cinsurance cut\u201d cycle \u2014 implemented to stave off the harmful effects of the Sino-American trade war and a global economic slowdown \u2014 as the market and U.S. economy appear OK, for now.\n\nThe market isn\u2019t expecting another rate cut until February after Wednesday\u2019s decision.\n\nWhat\u2019s most likely on Wednesday is a so-called \u201chawkish\u201d cut, one in which the Fed lowers interest rates as expected but communicates its intention to hold off on further monetary policy easing until further signs of economic weakness appear.\n\nThat could be disappointing for Wall Street, at least in the immediate term.", "description": "Wall Street braces for what seems almost assuredly to be a third rate cut in as many meetings of the Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon.", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU230_three__ZG_20191029135052.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
