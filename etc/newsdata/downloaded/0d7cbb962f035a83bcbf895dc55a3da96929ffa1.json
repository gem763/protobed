Sure, plenty of moms are familiar with scrutiny, judgment and unwelcome advice. The stranger on the street who says your baby\u2019s head is at an odd angle in the stroller. The man who pokes your pregnant belly in the lunch place near work and laughs. The fake-innocent, \u201cOh, she\u2019s still drinking from a bottle?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat is surely why this painful interview caused so much of a sisterhood call.\n\nIs there a P.O. Box where women can just send notes to Meghan Markle? Being like \u201cHave a really nice day, Meghan!\u201d and \u201cWHO DO I NEED TO FIGHT TODAY, MEGHAN?\u201d Like, just so she knows? She lives in THE tightest bubble and I just want her to know we\u2019re out here!!! \u2014 Jordan Crucchiola (@JorCru) October 18, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s why her pained expression actually brought tears to mere mom mortals. Because we, too, have felt ostracized, judged. Even if we weren\u2019t targeted by racists on top of it all. (Want to lose faith in all humanity? Search \u201cMarkle\u201d and \u201ccrying\u201d on Twitter. Then again, don\u2019t.)\n\nWhen we become mothers\u2014of any kind\u2014in our culture, we become targets. For hate, for judgement, for malice. There is no equivalent for fathers. It is a special kind of hate directly solely at mothers. https://t.co/hgIC293zJG \u2014 Rene Denfeld (@ReneDenfeld) October 19, 2019\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo when Meghan stopped to consider her words in this interview, and then thanked the interviewer for actually asking if she\u2019s okay, many of us could feel her exhaustion.\n\nAll that shaming, all that judging that so many women face as they are going through what is likely the most physically and mentally exhausting time in their lives, even the subtle digs \u2014 it\u2019s depleting, at a time in life when depletion is already in full force.\n\nThat is why Meghan\u2019s interview hit home with so many people who aren\u2019t called \u201cDuchess\u201d and aren\u2019t in a global spotlight, who aren\u2019t targeted by tabloids and followed by paparazzi.\n\nBecause we, too, know what it feels like to be picked apart when all we want is someone to ask if we\u2019re okay.\n\nAD\n\nFollow On Parenting on Facebook for more essays, news and updates, and join our discussion group here to talk about parenting and work.
