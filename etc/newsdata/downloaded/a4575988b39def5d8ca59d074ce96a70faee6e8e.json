We will have more cold water in this action than the last 10 years. By definition, it\u2019s necessary to support winter line spawning. Similarly with delta operations we have crafted a plan that will restrict pumping if there are cause for concern,\u201d said Paul Souza, the regional Fish and Wildlife Service official.\n\n\u201cOur commitment is that we will be as, or more, protective for delta operations than the last 10 years,\u201d Souza said on a call with reporters Tuesday.\n\nCritics fear the new plan, which would allow large quantities of water to be diverted from the San Francisco Bay Delta to the Central Valley in order to irrigate farmland, would ultimately harm the threatened fish species.\n\nThe announcement is likely to further raise ethics concerns surrounding Bernhardt, who just before joining the administration lobbied on behalf of a farming group based in California to roll back protections on the delta smelt. Bernhardt is currently under federal investigation over several ethics concerns including complaints that he continued to push the efforts of his former employee, Westlands Water District, to advance policy at the Interior Department.\n\nAgency officials denied the biological opinion issued on delta smelt protections Monday were connected to Bernhardt\u2019s previous employer.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no connection,\u201d said Souza, adding that he and the others who worked on the issue were \u201ccareer professionals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have led these efforts with our team over the past year and these are career professional documentation,\u201d he said.", "description": "The Trump administration is moving to weaken protections on an imperiled fish population in California\u2019s Central Valley, a\u00a0shift that Interior Secretary David Bernhardt had previously called for when he lobbied on behalf of farmers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bernhardtdavid_050719gn3_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
