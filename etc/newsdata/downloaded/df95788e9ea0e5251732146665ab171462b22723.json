The Nicaraguan government and police force did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement distributed on social media, the Nicaraguan Patriotic Alliance (APN), a little-known group opposed to President Daniel Ortega, said it executed \u201ca series of actions of a military nature\u201d on Saturday.\n\n\u201cAll these actions are carried out and will continue to be carried out the rest of the months of September, October and the months to come, until the dictatorship is broken,\u201d the group said.\n\nNicaragua has been gripped by a political crisis since demonstrations broke out against the Ortega government in April 2018 over planned cuts to welfare benefits.\n\nThe demonstrations spread into broader protests against Ortega, and subsequent clashes between pro-government forces and protesters have claimed more than 300 lives and prompted thousands of Nicaraguans to go into exile, rights groups say.\n\nAround the time the explosion occurred on the bridge, blasts could also be heard in the capital, Managua, and the nearby city of Masaya, according to local media reports. No damage was reported in either of those cities.\n\nThe damage to the bridge had been repaired by Sunday afternoon, according to a Reuters witness.\n\nCesar Acevedo, a member of the local branch of Ortega\u2019s party, said he also witnessed the explosion on the bridge.\n\n\u201cThey (the opposition) are determined to destroy,\u201d he said.", "description": "A Nicaraguan opposition group claimed responsibility on Sunday for \"military actions,\" after a series of small explosions struck the country, including one that damaged a bridge leading to Nicaragua's most important port.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
