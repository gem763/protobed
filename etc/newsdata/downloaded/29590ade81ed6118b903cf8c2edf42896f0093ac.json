There was one in white that came with a cut-out midriff, asymmetric ruffled hem and balloon sleeves, and another in black that suspended superfluous satin from the bust.\n\nThe clothes on the catwalk today were very much indicative of designers who, while at ease with sticking to what they do best, aren\u2019t afraid to push the sartorial envelope. Alas, being a Preen girl never seemed more appealing.\n\nRoland Mouret\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Roland Mouret Spring/Summer 2020 Show all 15 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Using the curving female figure as the starting point, the souped-up and cinched in gown became near ubiquitous among A-listers with everyone from Cameron Diaz to Scarlett Johansson and Dita Von Teese all wearing it well within a six-month period.\n\nHowever, this season there was far less sex appeal and a renewed focus on simplicity.\n\n\u201cA designer should define silhouettes not just clothes: this season\u2019s silhouette is the evolution and continuation of my work over the years,\u201d Mouret said.\n\nIn contrast to the scooped in draping and shaping the designer has become best known for, this season Mouret adopted a more laissez faire attitude that emanated from wide-leg trousers, boxy blazers, breezy shirt dresses and slack knitwear.\n\nBy incorporating more tailoring into his collection, the designer said he was inviting consumers to \u201cplay with the silhouette as a way to convey personal style\u201d.\n\nSure, he knows a woman\u2019s body well but it seems as though he has also sensed a shift in how they\u2019re minds and approach to dressing have changed.\n\nPerhaps the global call for action through movements such as #metoo and #timesup has prompted him to redefine his portrayal of female sexuality?\n\nMargaret Howell\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A single oversized pearl clasped in one models hand saw a flurry of show-goers camera phones rise, while studded leather purses and straw shoulder bags pulled together the entire concept.", "description": "The third day of London Fashion Week shows has come to an end and the five-day event is nearing its sartorial climax.
