We\u2019re doing an occasional series explaining why certain things seem to happen to your kid (or to your body or to your relationships) as your child grows. This week, we\u2019re talking about baby head banging. Read previous \u201cIs this a thing?\u201d newsletters here.

He does it accidentally plenty often, too, but sometimes he purposefully bumps his head on a window, for example, until we stop him. Is this a thing?\n\n\u2014Josie Curtis, Portland, Ore.\n\nA: Though your son\u2019s habit of repeatedly bonking his tiny head against a window may seem pretty bizarre (and possibly alarming), it is a common behavior for babies and little kids, according to the pediatricians and psychologist I spoke to for this piece.\n\nAccording to Patricia Kurtz, Ph.D., the director of neurobehavioral outpatient services at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, \u201cabout 15 percent of young children may bang their heads at some point prior to age 2,\u201d if they\u2019re developing typically. The behavior may start as early as 6 months and continue into early childhood , said Nia Heard-Garris, M.D., an attending physician at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago. Dr. Heard-Garris and Dr. Kurtz both said the behavior is more common in boys than in girls.\n\nSo why are they doing it? There are a few reasons.\n\nTo get your attention. Particularly for kids who don\u2019t have language yet, whacking their heads against something is a great way to get mom or dad to come scurrying over. In typical motor development, kids may occasionally bang their heads randomly, Dr. Kurtz said. But if they realize head banging gets you to pay attention, they may make it into a game. What started out as a r andom accident \u201ccan develop into a learned behavior,\u201d Dr. Kurtz said. (I never had a headbanger, but I recognized the parent-toddler feedback loop Dr. Kurtz described: One of my kids figured out that licking foreign surfaces reliably got our attention, so she licked everything, including a window at Southwest Florida International Airport, looking positively delighted with herself. We\u2019re just lucky she didn\u2019t get botulism.)\n\nTo discourage the behavior, move the child away from whatever surface she\u2019s banging her head against; say, \u201cno head banging;\u201d and distract her with a song or a game, said Hugh Bases, M.D., a clinical associate professor of pediatrics at N.Y.U. School of Medicine.\n\nTo self-soothe. Some children will bang their heads around naptime or bedtime, Dr. Heard-Garris said, as a way to calm their bodies down. \u201cThat repetition, that movement, that calms down their brain and tells them its time to go to sleep,\u201d she said. Hearing the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of your kid\u2019s head hitting the mattress for 10 minutes might be upsetting, Dr. Heard-Garris said. But do not install bumpers or put stuffed animals into the crib to interrupt your headbanger, she cautioned, as the safest sleep environment for babies is an empty crib with a flat mattress (more on safe sleep guidelines here).\n\nAnd don\u2019t go into the baby\u2019s room every time you hear the banging \u2014 he will have a very difficult time sleeping if you interrupt his soothing rituals. If you\u2019re concerned, you can watch him on a video monitor, Dr. Heard-Garris said.\n\nTo express frustration. Before children can convey their feelings in words, they may bang their heads if they are frustrated with a task. In that case, Dr. Bases said, observe the child\u2019s behavior. If you can recognize the signs of your child\u2019s frustration, you can help her before she starts head banging, Dr. Bases said.\n\nWhen to worry. If your child is regularly head banging to the point of bruising, swelling or self-injury, you should call your pediatrician, Dr. Kurtz said. Same goes for if the frequency or intensity of the head banging picks up. It may be a sign of an ear infection or gastroesophageal reflux in preverbal kids, because they can\u2019t express the pain they\u2019re feeling, so a medical workup may be in order.\n\nIf the head banging is accompanied by missed milestones, and delayed speech or motor skills, it\u2019s also something to mention to your pediatrician. According to Dr. Kurtz, if your child has already been diagnosed with a developmental delay or other disorder or disability, make sure to inform the pediatrician about the head banging, as it may develop into a more serious problem. Dr. Kurtz suggested closely observing the behavior, noting what tends to inspire the head banging and even taking videos of your child\u2019s head banging, as it may be useful for a pediatrician or other specialist to watch your little headbanger in action.\n\nWant More on Baby and Toddler Behavior?\n\nHas your kid ever stuck a pebble or other foreign object up his nose? We\u2019re here to help.\n\nYou may have heard the clich\u00e9 that little kids soak up new languages like sponges. That\u2019s what Lindsay Patterson thought would happen when she moved her 3-year-old to Barcelona, but the reality \u2014 and the science \u2014 turned out to be a bit more complicated.\n\nApparently I don\u2019t have the only lil\u2019 licker out there: The Oregon City Public Library has a \u201click bucket,\u201d where you can put objects that your child has defiled (presumably for the librarian to disinfect later).\n\nTiny Victories\n\nParenting can be a grind.
