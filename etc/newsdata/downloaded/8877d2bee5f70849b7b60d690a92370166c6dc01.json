While the party doubled its national vote share from 2015, and won three seats nationally, it fell short of the projected six. Along with May, Paul Manly hung on to his seat in Nanaimo-Ladysmith, and Jenica Atwin won in Fredericton, becoming the first Green MP elected east of B.C.\n\nGreen Party Elizabeth May speaks to a crowd of supporters on election night in Victoria, B.C. 9:06\n\nThe Liberals won 157 seats, and are expected to form a minority government. The Conservatives own the popular vote, but finished with 121 seats. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois finished with 32; the NDP with 24.\n\nMay said her party's role is now to be \"the conscience of Parliament,\" and \"hold the Liberals to account.\"\n\nShe said her three Green MPs could be aided by Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was elected as an independent MP in Vancouver Granville. Wilson-Raybould was ejected from the Liberal caucus in April along with Jane Philpott over the SNC-Lavalin affair.\n\nMay extended an invitation for both women to join the Greens, but they declined. Philpott lost her seat Monday night.\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
