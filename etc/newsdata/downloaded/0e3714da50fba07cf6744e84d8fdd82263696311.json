If you\u2019ve ever had your picture taken with President Donald Trump, anyone named Trump, or walked past a Trump property, there\u2019s a better than even chance House Democrats will demand answers and documents from you in the coming weeks. Maybe it\u2019s time to turn the tables.\n\nDemocrats are searching, desperately, for anything to validate their push for impeachment.\n\nThey\u2019re only missing any evidence to justify the foregone conclusion they\u2019re gearing everything toward. It\u2019s amazing what a political party will do when they lack a candidate with charisma and an agenda with support.\n\nWith that in mind, Democrats have embraced the ancient art of \u201cmaking sh*t up.\u201d\n\nHearings with no questions asked to elicit any information, just political speeches delivered one soundbite at a time. Flat-out lies and fantasy portrayed as \u201cparody\u201d broadcast across the country with no \u201cjournalistic\u201d pushback. It\u2019s been a joke everyone whose job it is to know better has been ignoring. But there is one thing Republicans could do that couldn\u2019t be ignored \u2013 put a few of these Democrats under oath.\n\nThe idea of mutually assured destruction is used to keep order, not only in the Cold War but in politics in general. Dirty tricks and lies have always had their place, but they\u2019re now the currency and the language of the left. Making them pay up, even a little, might be the only way to restore some semblance of sanity.\n\nWitnesses before congressional committees must be sworn in, must swear to tell the truth under penalty of perjury. Members of Congress who ask the questions take no such oath; they\u2019re free to lie and lie freely.\n\nWhile Democrats are dragging anyone they can think of in front of nearly every committee in the House, desperately looking for anything to justify their political \u201chail Mary,\u201d maybe the Senate should involve itself in the \u201chunt for truth.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing stopping Republicans in the Senate from calling someone like Congressman Adam Schiff to testify before some relevant committee, perhaps the Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe House handles impeachment, but the Senate has oversight duties as well. Democrats like Schiff have been making declarative statements about crimes and improper activities like he has secret and firsthand knowledge of activities the country would be well-served to know. After all, if Schiff has, like he\u2019s said several times, evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, he should be asked to produce it, under oath.\n\nThere\u2019s also the curious case of how Schiff was tweeting out the Democratic Party\u2019s latest impeachment narrative involving Ukraine weeks before he publicly claimed to have learned about the phone call he \u201cparodied\u201d in the House last week.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be fun to see him under oath, testifying under penalty of perjury, about what he knew and when he knew it? Democrats dragged Corey Lewandowski up to the Hill for a hearing with no other point than to embarrass him and the president (which backfired on them horribly), maybe that favor should be returned by Senate Republicans.\n\nSchiff has made many declarative, unequivocal statements of presidential crimes, claiming to have seen evidence himself. The American people deserve to know, under penalty of perjury, what exactly he knows that he\u2019s keeping to himself.\n\nHe and other Democrats, especially those Democrats with press credentials, will express outrage over the move, they\u2019d even likely try to challenge it in court. But they really shouldn\u2019t.\n\nPresident Trump has released everything related to the phone call with the Ukrainian president Democrats insist is somehow a high crime or misdemeanor. Democrats wouldn\u2019t try to obstruct an investigation seeking the proof they\u2019ve declared they\u2019ve found, right?\n\nOf course they\u2019d fight it, of course they\u2019d complain, of course they\u2019d be outraged. But they\u2019d probably lose on the fight over the subpoena. Members of Congress are American citizens, and both the House and Senate can subpoena anyone. Just think of how illuminating it would be to get him under oath, to subpoena his phone/text records and emails for the past year to get to the bottom of what he\u2019s been telling the American people. If he knows of presidential crimes, as he\u2019s claimed, we need to know about it.\n\nAdam Schiff is a liar, but he never opens himself up to any interview where he\u2019ll be asked about it; he only sits with friendly journalists who don\u2019t press or call him out.\n\nEither Adam Schiff knows something or he doesn\u2019t, has proof or he doesn\u2019t, the American people deserve to find out. Someone in the Senate, a committee chairman like Lindsey Graham, is in the perfect position to get to the bottom of it, or expose Schiff as the fraud he is. Either way, just think of how much fun it would all be.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "The subpoenas are flying like feces in the monkey cage. .10/01/2019 0:18:58AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Beth Baumann", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/142/e22b611a-c664-49f1-8008-9e6638bc8a52.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
