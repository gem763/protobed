The app and accompanying web service has been used to mark the locations of police and inform about street closures during the ongoing pro-democracy protests that have engulfed Hong Kong this year.\n\nApple initially rejected HKmap.live from the App Store earlier this month, then reversed its decision a few days later. Now it has reversed its reversal.\n\nHere\u2019s Apple\u2019s statement:\n\nWe created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps. We have learned that an app, HKmap.live, has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong. Many concerned customers in Hong Kong have contacted us about this app and we immediately began investigating it. The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement. This app violates our guidelines and local laws, and we have removed it from the App Store.\n\n\u201cThere is 0 evidence to support CSTCB\u2019s accusation,\u201d the HKmap developers said in response. \u201cHKmap App never solicits, promotes, or encourages criminal activity. HKmap App consolidates information from user and public sources, e.g. live news stream, Facebook and Telegram.\u201d\n\nYesterday, English-language state media outlet China Daily blasted Apple\u2019s decision to allow HKmap.live onto the App Store. \u201cProviding a gateway for \u2018toxic apps\u2019 is hurting the feelings of the Chinese people, twisting the facts of Hong Kong affairs, and against the views and principles of the Chinese people,\u201d the op-ed argued.\n\nApple\u2019s enforcement of App Store policies is inconsistent at best, so it\u2019s hard to take its statement at face value. The company hasn\u2019t said which \u201clocal laws\u201d HKmap.live may violate. It is worth pointing out, however, that apps like Waze \u2014 which similarly allow users to track the locations of police checkpoints \u2014 remain in the App Store elsewhere. Earlier today Apple also removed the app of news outlet Quartz, which has been providing strong coverage of the Hong Kong protests, from China\u2019s App Store.\n\nFor now, HKmap.live\u2019s web version is still accessible on the iPhone.", "description": "\"This app violates our guidelines and local laws.\"", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CFq90vfORwtfdQoAh_WWfGh-Bc0=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19274659/DSCF7157.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
