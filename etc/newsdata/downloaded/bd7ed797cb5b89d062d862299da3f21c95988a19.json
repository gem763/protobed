by US military", "language": "en", "text": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 US officials said Monday that the body of Islamic State group chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was buried at sea as fresh details surfaced about the US special forces operation that led to his death over the weekend.\n\nSyrian Kurds claimed to be a key source of the intelligence that led Americans to Baghdadi after years of tracking the brutal jihadist leader behind a five-year reign of terror across much of Iraq and Syria.\n\nAnd an unnamed US military dog became a unlikely hero of the raid, incurring injuries as it chased Baghdadi down a dead-end tunnel underneath his northwestern Syria hideout before he blew himself and three children up with a suicide vest.\n\nThe US military basked in success Monday after the eliminating the founder and spiritual guide of the Islamic State (IS) group, capping a years-long campaign to crush the Sunni Muslim extremist organization that had at one point created a \u201ccaliphate\u201d straddling the Euphrates River that rivaled the size of England.\n\n\u201cHis death marks a devastating blow to the remnants of (IS),\u201d said Defense Secretary Mark Esper.\n\n\u2013 Raid undertaken \u2018brilliantly\u2019 \u2013\n\nHe praised the nearly hundred-strong force that helicoptered to the rural compound in the Idlib region of Syria in a complex mission that required coordination with Russians, Kurds, Turks and President Bashar al-Assad regime to prevent US aircraft from being fired upon.\n\n\u201cThey executed the raid in all of its facets brilliantly,\u201d Esper said.\n\nJoint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Mark Milley said no one was injured in the operation, despite the US team taking fire when they arrived.\n\nThey took two men prisoner, and Baghdadi\u2019s remains were removed after he killed himself.\n\n\u201cBaghdadi\u2019s remains were then transported to a secure facility to confirm his identity with forensic DNA testing,\u201d Milley said.\n\n\u201cThe disposal of his remains has been done, is complete and was handled appropriately,\u201d he added, saying it was handled \u201cin accordance with the law of armed conflict.\u201d\n\nAnother Pentagon official confirmed that Baghdadi\u2019s body was dumped into the sea at an unnamed location, similar to the 2011 sea burial of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after he was killed in a US special forces raid in Pakistan.\n\n\u2013 Baghdadi\u2019s underwear \u2013\n\nA Kurdish official said an inside source they oversaw was responsible for leading US forces to Baghdadi\u2019s hideout, helping to map out the interior of the compound, its staffing, as well as making it possible for them to identify Baghdadi.\n\n\u201cSince 15 May, we have been working together with the CIA to track al-Baghdadi and monitor him closely,\u201d said Polat Can, a senior adviser to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nThe group had an informant who was able to infiltrate Baghdadi\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cAl-Baghdadi changed his places of residence very often,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cOur intelligence source was involved in sending coordinates, directing the airdrop, participating in and making the operation a success until the last minute,\u201d Polat Can said.\n\nThe source also \u201cbrought al-Baghdadi\u2019s underwear to conduct a DNA test and make sure (100%) that the person in question was al-Baghdadi himself,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Beautiful\u2019 military dog \u2013\n\nAttention focused as well on the unnamed dog \u2014 likely a Belgian Malinois, a breed favored by the military, which chased Baghdadi into a tunnel under the complex and cornered him before he detonated his suicide vest.\n\nPresident Donald Trump praised the dog on Sunday as \u201cbeautiful,\u201d but military officials said any information about it, including its name, was secret.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s classified, we\u2019re protecting the dog\u2019s identity,\u201d said Milley.\n\nThe dog had been \u201cslightly wounded and is fully recovering,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe dog is still in theater, returned to duty, with its handler.\u201d\n\n\u2013 US will not police Syria \u2013\n\nUS officials said Baghdadi\u2019s death would not end the conflict in the Syria, but warned Washington could not be relied on to bring peace to the region.\n\n\u201cBaghdadi\u2019s death will not rid the world of terrorism or end the ongoing conflict in Syria,\u201d said Esper.\n\n\u201cThe security situation in Syria remains complex,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cActing as a police force out to solve every dispute is not our mission.\u201d\n\nBut he said the death of Baghdadi \u201cwill certainly send a message to those who would question America\u2019s resolve and provide a warning to terrorists who think they can hide.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 US officials said Monday that the body of Islamic
