An estimated 3.1 million Americans would be affected. But the proposal did not disclose the cuts\u2019 ripple effect: Since food stamps are one of the ways that students become eligible for free school lunches, cutting those benefits could leave half a million children without school meals, reports The Washington Post.\n\nSeveral organizations are speaking out against the proposal. \u201cWe think the administration should withdraw the rule,\u201d Crystal FitzSimons, school and out-of-school time programs director for the Food Research and Action Center, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThe rule, if they move forward with it, is expected to impact 500,000 kids\u2019 automatic access to free school meals. We would expect school meals debts, which is a growing issue for a lot of schools, to get worse. We would expect kids to be hungry in the classroom.\u201d\n\nFitzSimons adds: \u201cKids who are hungry can\u2019t learn. They have a hard time focusing, concentrating and behaving. There\u2019s a huge body of research on the positive impact that access to a healthy diet has on learning.\u201d\n\nAmerican Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten calls the proposal \u201ccruel.\u201d She tells Yahoo Lifestyle, \"In the richest country in the world, no child should be denied access to lunch at school because of their parents' income level or a cruel attempt by the Trump administration to cut food benefit programs for needy kids.\u201d\n\nWeingarten adds: \"Hungry children cannot focus on learning. Instead of shaming them, we should be investing in programs that support them and help them feel safe and welcome at school: nutrition programs that promote healthy habits and nurture families facing food scarcity, affordable breakfast and lunch for any kid who needs it, and other community and school supports that build students up, not tear them down.\u201d\n\nNot only would a half-million children be impacted by this plan, but teachers would be affected as well. According to a Yahoo Lifestyle survey of 50 teachers throughout the U.S., educators are already paying hundreds \u2014 and in some cases, thousands \u2014 of dollars each year out of their own pockets to provide supplies for their classrooms and students. But the money doesn\u2019t only go to pencils and paper. Teachers also help hungry students in need by buying them food. More hungry students could mean teachers spending even more of their own money without getting reimbursed.\n\n\u201cThe impact for teachers, who are really on the front lines \u2014 they\u2019re going to be feeling it,\u201d says FitzSimons. \u201cTeachers who see hunger among their students are more likely to provide food. No teacher wants students in their classroom to be sitting there hungry, so a lot of them will step in. [The proposal] will increase hunger both at school and at home, so schools will be struggling to deal with and respond to it.\u201d\n\nAdds Weingarten: \"Teachers already spend money out of their own pockets because they want their students to be successful. This new rule will not change that, but it is unfair and simply unnecessary.\"\n\nCourtney Jones, an elementary school teacher from Tyler, Texas who founded CleartheLists to help teachers buy items on their school supplies wish lists, says that if children are hungry and the school or their parents are not able to provide for them, \u201cteachers often feel obligated to meet the demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why we spend so much out of pocket,\u201d she says.\n\nJones says the proposed rule to cut benefits would negatively affect children\u2019s ability to learn. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that burden on them, \u2018Am I going to eat or not today?\u2019 If they\u2019re not getting the nutrients they need, then how are they going to perform?\u201d she says.\n\nBut Jones also knows that teachers will do whatever they can to help those students in need. \u201cI think that\u2019s why people are in the profession \u2014 to give \u2014 but it shouldn\u2019t be monetary or about food,\u201d says Jones. \u201cIt should be focusing specifically on the subject you\u2019re teaching. Food should be an automatic. It just seems like a no-brainer.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cObviously, we\u2019re going to make up the difference if we have to for the sake of the kids. It\u2019s so sad.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A Trump administration plan could cause a ripple effect, eliminating free school lunches to 500,000 children in need.", "authors": ["Rachel Grumman Bender", "Beauty", "Style Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Mzd9aSKW3ICbBC1dUeUkqw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/9650e180-dfd2-11e9-bd37-656e21966c86", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
