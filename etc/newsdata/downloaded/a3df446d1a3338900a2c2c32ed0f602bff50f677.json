Showing ID to vote is a reasonable and proportionate way to protect our elections,\" the Cabinet Office spokeswoman said in a statement.\n\nAny voter who does not have an approved form of ID, such as a passport or driving licence, will be able to apply, free of charge, for a local electoral ID from their local authority, according to government plans.\n\nAbout 3.5 million people in Britain had none of these types of photo ID, according to a 2015 Electoral Commission report.\n\nCivil rights groups, including the Salvation Army, homeless charity Centrepoint and Liberty, last year issued a letter warning compulsory voter ID would disproportionately impact the homeless, those without a permanent address, and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic groups (BAME).\n\nClare Collier, advocacy director at civil rights group Liberty, said the risk of electoral fraud was being used as an excuse for greater surveillance of the British public.\n\nThe reforms are now subject to debate by parliament, concluding with a vote for approval next week.\n\n\"Voter ID is likely to damage election turnout and will worst affect those who are already disadvantaged - including young people, older people, disabled, transgender, BAME communities and homeless people,\" she said.\n\n($1 = 0.7911 pounds) (Reporting by Adela Suliman @Adela_Suliman; editing by Belinda Goldsmith Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate change, women's and LGBT+ rights, human trafficking and property rights.
