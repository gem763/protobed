You never know,\u201d he added.\n\nBottas won the previous race in Japan, his third victory of the campaign, and arrived in Mexico refreshed after a break in the Seychelles.\n\nThe permutations for Sunday are multiple but Hamilton must finish on the podium at the very least to have a chance of wrapping up things.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting for sure tougher in each race,\u201d said Bottas. \u201cBut there\u2019s no point saying it\u2019s over because it isn\u2019t. It is when it actually happens.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s a bit of a longshot, if I\u2019m being realistic but we\u2019ll just focus on individual races and this weekend, like in Japan, really try to do the best I can and try to win the race.\u201d\n\nMercedes have struggled in Mexico for the past two seasons, but Bottas expressed hope those problems might not reappear on Sunday.\n\n\u201cLast year we had a really difficult race, we were struggling a lot with the tyre dropoff. I don\u2019t know how many pitstops we did,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe tyres are slightly harder this year, which could help, and it is a different car and very different setup...what we saw in Japan was we have a good race car and hopefully that will be the case on Sunday again.\u201d\n\nThe Finn said Mercedes, who had no driver on the podium in Mexico last year, had understood and analysed last year\u2019s problems.\n\n\u201cWe think we know what we should do and we try to fix and do better than last year,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was really related to the tyres and which kind of temperature window you operate them and make them last.\u201d", "description": "Valtteri Bottas needs a miracle to deny Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton a sixth Formula One title but the Finn is not completely ruling it out.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444690362&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N20E", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
