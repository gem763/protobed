Charles Sumner (R-Mass.) with a cane. Sumner had insulted Brooks\u2019 cousin, Andrew Butler, for his role in \u201cthe crime against Kansas,\u201d legislation allowing the western territory to enter the Union as a slave state. The assault, which incapacitated Sumner for months, shocked Americans, who regarded it as an intrusion of violence into the heart of American institutions.\n\nFast-forward to a conference room in the bowels of the House of Representatives on Oct. 23, 2019, where Defense Department official Laura Cooper was scheduled to testify to three House committees about the Trump administration\u2019s postponement of a military appropriation to help Ukraine defend itself against a Russian-backed occupation of its territory and allegations of a quid pro quo to release the funds if the president of Ukraine launched an investigation of Joe Biden Joe BidenDuring deposition, official says he made several efforts to advocate for Marie Yovanovitch Bolton looms large as impeachment inquiry accelerates Giuliani associate used small town in Ukraine to gain influence with American figures: report MORE and his son, Hunter.\n\nLed by Reps Matt Gaetz Matthew (Matt) GaetzEx-GOP lawmaker on Graham, Gaetz's defense of Trump: 'They look like fools' Gingrich calls impeachment process a 'despicable violation of the American Constitution' Bannon returns from exile to wage impeachment battle for Trump MORE (R-Fla.), Mo Brooks Morris (Mo) Jackson BrooksTop Democrat: Court ruling 'wipes out' GOP claim of 'fake' impeachment GOP protest overshadows impeachment hearing Republicans storm closed-door hearing to protest impeachment inquiry MORE (R-Ala.), Jim Jordan James (Jim) Daniel JordanElijah Cummings, native son of Baltimore, gets emotional send-off from Democratic luminaries Clinton memorializes Cummings for standing 'against corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel' The Memo: GOP schisms deepen as Trump impeachment pressure rises MORE (R-Ohio), Louie Gohmert Louis (Louie) Buller GohmertElijah Cummings, native son of Baltimore, gets emotional send-off from Democratic luminaries MSNBC's Donny Deutsch: 'Pathetic' Republicans who stormed closed hearing are 'boring, nerdy-looking white guys' Overnight Defense: Trump lifts sanctions on Turkey | 'Small number' of troops to remain by Syrian oil fields | Defense official's impeachment testimony delayed five hours after Republicans storm secure room MORE (R-Texas) and Steve King Steven (Steve) Arnold KingMSNBC's Donny Deutsch: 'Pathetic' Republicans who stormed closed hearing are 'boring, nerdy-looking white guys' Overnight Defense: Trump lifts sanctions on Turkey | 'Small number' of troops to remain by Syrian oil fields | Defense official's impeachment testimony delayed five hours after Republicans storm secure room Republicans storm closed-door hearing to protest impeachment inquiry MORE (R-Iowa) \u2014 paragons of civility, protocol, and the rule of law \u2014 more than two dozen Republican mad hatters marched into the room to denounce, disrupt, and distract attention from the investigation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nInstead of a cane, they brandished their cellphones (a risk to national security that violates House rules), so their constituents could see them in action in real time. In contrast to the caning of Sen. Sumner, their violence was verbal: Rep. Gaetz branded the Democrats \u201crabid hyenas.\u201d Approved in advance by President Donald Trump, their protest was linked to statements by the president and his press secretary, Stephanie Grisham Stephanie GrishamGrisham: John Kelly ill-equipped to work with 'the genius of our great president' Trump denies WaPost story that he is 'concerned with the impeachment scam' Trump dismisses need for impeachment team: 'I'm the team' MORE, that labelled diplomats willing to testify in the growing Ukraine scandal and Republicans who failed to support him \u201cNever Trumpers,\u201d \u201cradical unelected bureaucrats,\u201d and \u201chuman scum.\u201d Their strategy followed the Trump playbook: If the facts are not on your side, libel the presenters of those facts, trash the process, and hope no one is paying enough attention to realize that you are creating fake news.\n\nDespite its ludic character, this strategy poses a threat to our democracy. Here\u2019s why:\n\nSuch an intrusion is especially inappropriate \u2014 and damaging \u2014 because no principle is at stake. After all, the Republican argument that closed-door hearings are wrong is contradicted by Republican past practice as well as the two previous impeachment proceedings of modern times. While Judiciary Committee hearings are usually held in open session, closed hearings are customary for others, including the Intelligence Committee, which handles classified and sensitive information related to national security.\n\nIn the early phases of the impeachment investigations of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonFeud by Alabama Democrats threatens Doug Jones's reelection Maher: The Clintons need to 'go away' for 2020 election Cummings' staff honor him in op-ed: He brought 'moral clarity' MORE, witnesses did not testify in public. Nor were the hearings on the terrorist attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi. In fact, Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who chaired the Benghazi proceedings, refused access to Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), his Republican colleague and chair of the House Oversight Committee. Public hearings, Gowdy subsequently explained, have taken on \u201ca professional wrestling type carnival atmosphere.\u201d The Democrats, it is important to add, are operating under procedures enacted by a Republican majority in 2015. The Trump administration has responded to subpoenas for documents and testimony with a blanket refusal to cooperate with the investigation. And Democrats have promised to conduct public hearings following the information-gathering phase of their inquiry.\n\nSecond, breaking the rules of the House may lead to a spiral of movement/countermovement interaction that could increase the dysfunction in government by exacerbating the already-tense and intensely partisan climate in Congress. \u201cRegular order,\u201d as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) frequently said, is essential to well-functioning legislatures.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThird, the Republicans\u2019 strategy \u2014 including the president\u2019s foul and inflammatory language \u2014 may well trigger less comic and more violent forms of collective behavior by his supporters outside of Congress. Already, in response to Trump\u2019s call for the Republicans to \u201cget tough,\u201d Major League umpire Rob Drake threatened to buy an AR-15 to attack anyone who would dare to impeach \u201chis\u201d president.\n\nWhat can be done? Democrats should \u2014 in the words of Michelle Obama \u2014 \u201cgo high when they go low.\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiWSJ: Sondland told the House that Trump's Ukraine pressure was a quid pro quo Schiff says committees are making 'rapid progress' in impeachment probe McConnell blasts impeachment inquiry as 'kangaroo court' in fundraising pitch MORE (D-Calif.), Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSchiff says committees are making 'rapid progress' in impeachment probe Trump rages against 'garbage' Ukraine probe ahead of latest witness deposition Mark Zuckerberg deserves praise for his noble stand on free speech MORE (D-Calif.), and their Democratic colleagues in the House should think carefully about when and how they will present the already-damning and \u2014 to a growing number of Americans \u2014 irrefutable indictment of President Trump Donald John Trump Comey: Mueller 'didn't succeed in his mission because there was inadequate transparency' During deposition, official says he made several efforts to advocate for Marie Yovanovitch Bolton looms large as impeachment inquiry accelerates MORE that has come from the unimpeachable, patriotic, non-partisan sources they have interviewed \u2014 anyone inclined to believe that William B. Taylor and Marie Yovanovitch are \u201cradical unelected bureaucrats\u201d or \u201chuman scum\u201d should read their biographies.\n\nAs for the Republicans, we can only hope that more responsible, saner spirits will triumph over the Gaetzes and Gohmerts. If principled arguments do not persuade them, perhaps they will realize that the time will come \u2014 and it may be soon \u2014 when the Democrats will be in a position to censure similar stunts.\n\nFinally, Americans faced by the spectacle of congressional comedy should resist the temptation to tune out\u2026 After all, it is our duty as citizens to decide whether the behavior of the president and his acolytes is compatible with their obligations under the Constitution.\n\nGlenn C.
