Similar declines were recorded in Germany, Italy and Britain. In the United States, sales have continued to rise, but only slightly.\n\nThe worsening performance has sent share prices for the 14 largest manufacturers down by 28 per cent on average, the report said.\n\nThe auto industry's retreat shaved 0.4 per cent off of global GDP last year, while auto exports, even by the world's largest manufacturers, fell 3.1 per cent.\n\nFor this year, industry analysts forecast a four per cent decline, the report said. It blames tariffs in the US-China trade war, which have made China's US auto imports more expensive.\n\nIn Europe, falling demand for diesel-powered autos, Brexit uncertainty and new emissions tests expected at the end of 2019 are weighing on industry.\n\nAmong the major causes of last year's slowdown are new European pollution standards known as WLTP (for Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles test).\n\n\"The large number of models requiring certification led to bottlenecks at testing agencies and several automakers had to adjust production schedules to avoid unwanted inventory accumulation,\" the report said.\n\nThis trend has been exacerbated by slower demand in some emerging markets like Turkey, and above all in China, where the end of tax breaks for auto buyers has hurt demand.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Transport - [WASHINGTON] There is trouble on the horizon for the global auto industry, which faces new European anti-pollution standards, shrinking Chinese tax breaks and rising trade barriers, according to the International Monetary Fund. .
