Britain is the biggest export market for champagne, buying more than 26m bottles a year, helping support the French economy and a champagne market worth \u20ac4.9bn (\u00a34.3bn).\n\nThe Comit\u00e9 Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne trade body told Reuters last week that growers and champagne houses had overstocked in Britain to avoid Brexit disruption.\n\nWine critic Antoine Gerbelle told the news agency there was enough stockpiled to meet British demand for at least a year. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a champagne crisis at Christmas,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to secret documents that the government was forced to make public last week up to 85% of lorries crossing the Channel might not be ready for a new French customs regime.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nSpelling out the government\u2019s \u201cplanning assumptions\u201d under Operation Yellowhammer \u2013 the government\u2019s no-deal plan \u2013 the flow of HGVs could be cut by 40-60% from current levels within one day as unready trucks fill the ports on both sides of the Channel.\n\nMore than half of UK firms are not ready to trade with the EU under a no-deal scenario, according to the Cips survey of 817 supply chain managers at firms across 11 sectors of the British economy,\n\nGlen said companies were fearful about their ability to survive the busy Christmas period. \u201cMass border disruption during this time could have a catastrophic impact. Businesses need to be provided with as much detail and support as possible to ensure they can survive the festive period.\u201d", "description": "Companies rush to bring forward deliveries of champagne, wine, beer and spirits in time for the festive period", "authors": ["Richard Partington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f29d75df5c47f0c37b1c9dbd2d72eb20af12da3f/0_372_5934_3560/master/5934.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b22266bcc5cf91cbe71a5ebcc38c4303", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
