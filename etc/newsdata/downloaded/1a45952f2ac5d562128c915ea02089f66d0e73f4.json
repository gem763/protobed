For junior tennis stars from grades 5 through 12, costs exceed $50,000 per year for a tennis performance program, school tuition and housing, not including extra private lessons, yoga classes and mental coaching.\n\nGauff, the 15-year-old tennis phenom who is set to play in the U.S. Open\u2019s third round on Saturday, began training at the facility when she was just 10 years old. Though Mouratoglou did not train Gauff directly, he said he recognized a \u201cfuture champion\u201d in the Florida native.\n\n\u201cEverything I believed was necessary to become a champion, I can see at that age already,\u201d Mourataglou told the New York Post. \u201cIf I point out the most important things, saw athleticism, the drive, self-confidence \u2014 but not cocky \u2014 just a belief in herself. Hard worker. Super competitor. You see her in practice, then she goes into the match, it\u2019s a different level. She knows how to win.\u201d\n\nMourataglou has personally coached Williams, a 23-time major winner, since 2012. Other prominent tennis stars associated with his academy include Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray and 2018 junior world champion Jason Tseng.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe academy\u2019s intensive training program for students includes two tennis sessions and one fitness session per day, as well as medical monitoring, tournaments and private lessons.\n\nDozens of students aged 11-18 train at the Mourataglou Tennis Academy. While not all trainees are destined for pro stardom, many students end up with scholarships to American colleges, Mourataglou told Reuters in 2017.\n\nGauff\u2019s stint at the academy was only one element of her training. Her father, Corey Gauff, serves as her primary coach, while an academy trainer provides secondary instruction.\n\nThe young phenom rocketed to national stardom last June, when she became the youngest-ever player to qualify for the main draw at Wimbledon. She beat Venus Williams, Serena\u2019s older sister and another idol, in straight sets in the tournament\u2019s opening round.\n\n\u201cSerena Williams has always been an idol, and Venus, I mean, they\u2019re the reason I wanted to pick up a tennis racket,\u201d Gauff told reporters at the time. \u201cI met them both, and they\u2019re both super kind people and I\u2019m just super happy and thankful that they chose to play tennis because I\u2019m sure they\u2019d dominate any sport they wanted to play.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Training isn't cheap if you're working to become a tennis star.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/coco-gauff-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
