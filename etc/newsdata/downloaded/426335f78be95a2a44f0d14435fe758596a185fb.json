But with the prospects of a deal looking slim, The Independent has been told the recall will now be staged \u201ceither way\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are in uncharted waters because only God knows what Boris is up to,\u201d said the MP. \u201cWhatever people had been discussing, they are not discussing it in the same context any more because of this move by Number 10.\u201d\n\nPlotters are wary of giving Downing Street too much notice of their plans, or of striking before a majority is assured, said the MP: \u201cA lot of people are looking for ways to try to get the option of a second referendum onto the table, but we want to make sure we avoid the danger of it not being carried.\u201d\n\nEven if passed, any referendum motion would come up against a series of obstacles, including the fact that it would require a money resolution to authorise the substantial spending involved, which can only be tabled by a minister.", "description": "Parliamentary supporters of a Final Say referendum could hijack an emergency sitting of the Commons on 19 October to force a public vote on any Brexit outcome.
