We had a bit of a curveball when we announced your name to our family, as someone pointed out, it's possibly illegal to name you that in Australia, as it falls loosely under the category of 'title' like 'King', 'Duke', 'Lord' or 'Captain'.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"We tried to change it. \u2018Disco\u2019 even came back into play! But nothing else felt right for you as a Libra, with a [very sensible and grounded] Capricorn moon. So Citizen you are, and always will be- a Citizen of the world.\"\n\nClaire's three other children are called Atlas, Everest and Zephyr.\n\nThe Births, Deaths and Marriages in Australia consider a number of names unacceptable if they include swear words and unpronounceable names, like symbols and numbers.\n\nIt is also considered unacceptable if the name is contentious. Names such as 'Commissioner', 'Inspector', 'Queen' and 'Citizen' could fall into this category.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nClaire and her husband revealed that they put the name through a simple test before deciding to use it, reported MailOnline .\n\nShe said: \"When thinking about names we like, Rich and I would put it through the 'can they be a rockstar or an accountant?' test. [not that I particularly want either of these professions for any of my children, but you get the drift- \"an adaptable name\"!]\"\n\nBut Claire's post left some of her followers confused as they asked if she had the name approved or not.\n\nOne said: \"Is this his registered name or was it not approved but you're calling him it anyway? Just wondering!!!\"\n\nAnother agreed: \"So has it been approved by the BGM yet?\"", "description": "Claire named her 10-day-old son 'Citizen' but could run into legal troubles if she insisted", "authors": ["Tiffany Lo", "Image", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658366.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_19939238-7592289-image-m-8_1571523917696.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
