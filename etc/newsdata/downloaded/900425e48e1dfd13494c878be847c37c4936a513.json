Three Nike stores in Chengdu, a bustling inland city in southwest China, also removed Rockets products. [\u2026] A specialist NBA store at Super Brand Mall, a major shopping center in the Shanghai financial district of Lujiazui, has also removed all Rockets-related merchandise. \u201cOther stuff, there hasn\u2019t been any impact, and no one has said we need to withdraw it,\u201d said a store manager, laughing. \u201cIf they say that all NBA stuff has to be withdrawn then our store will go bankrupt.\u201d\n\nChinese e-commerce sites such as Alibaba and JD.com have also scrubbed Houston Rockets merchandise from their platforms, according to the report.\n\nThe development is the latest fallout prompted by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, who tweeted on Sunday that \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d a reference to the on-going demonstrations in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\n\nA short time after Morey posted that statement, the NBA said it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that the deleted tweet offended many in China. And all that followed several companies in China, including some of the NBA\u2019s major business partners there, lashing out over Morey\u2019s original tweet.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d Morey wrote on Twitter Monday. \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d\n\nHowever, Morey kowtowing to China failed to prevent the NBA\u2019s partners in the communist country from suspending their activities with the league.\n\n\u201cOut of the 25 official partners listed on the NBA China website, 13 are Chinese businesses. So far, 11 of those companies have distanced themselves from the league amid escalating tensions between China and the NBA,\u201d CNBC reports.\n\nChinese companies that have cut ties include, Ctrip.com, Anta Sports, Changhong, Meiling, and Dicos.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Houston Rockets merchandise was removed from various Nike stores in China\u00a0amid a free speech\u00a0uproar, a Thursday report states.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-78648165-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
