The defending Super Bowl champs are the only undefeated team in the conference.\n\nSeveral of the other top-tier contenders in the AFC had a rough weekend, highlighted by the Kansas City Chiefs, who now have lost back-to-back games at home following a 31-24 defeat to the Houston Texans on Sunday. The Los Angeles Chargers, who won 12 games last season and entered 2019 with high expectations, fell to 2-4 with a loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night. The Cleveland Browns were a popular preseason pick to contend in the AFC, but they have fell woefully short of expectations with a 2-4 record.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSo, which AFC team is the Patriots' biggest competition?

The Patriots escaped New Era Field with a 16-10 victory. New England's defense played stellar, while Tom Brady posted the worst QB rating of his career in a win.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bills and Patriots are the only teams in the AFC with fewer than two losses. Buffalo's quarterback situation isn't great -- does anyone really believe in Josh Allen? -- but its defense and run game without a doubt are legit. These division rivals don't play again until Week 16, and given how both teams have played so far, that matchup at Gillette Stadium could have meaningful implications on the AFC playoff race.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
