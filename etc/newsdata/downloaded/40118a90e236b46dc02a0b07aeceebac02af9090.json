He had six carries for 20 yards after averaging 124.3 in the first three games.\n\nMoss was on the sideline in the second half with his left shoulder wrapped in ice.\n\nUtah coach Kyle Whittingham did not update Moss' condition, but said the senior would be evaluated when the team got back to Salt Lake City.\n\n---\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP-Top25", "description": "Southern California quarterback Kedon Slovis was knocked out of the Trojans' 30-23 victory against No. 10 Utah on Friday night after taking a legal but hard hit from Utes defensive tackle Leki Fotu early in the first quarter.
