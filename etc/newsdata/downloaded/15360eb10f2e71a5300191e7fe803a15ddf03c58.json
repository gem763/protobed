In the firm\u2019s own words, the \u201ctrough of disillusionment\u201d means that \u201cinterest [in the technology] wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investments continue only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Gartner\u2018s Hype Cycle \u2013 a graphical representation of the life cycle stages a technology goes through from conception to maturity and widespread adoption \u2013 shows most blockchain technologies are still five to 10 years away from transformational impact.\n\nSource: Gartner (October 2019)\n\n\u201cBlockchain technologies have not yet lived up to the hype and most enterprise blockchain projects are stuck in experimentation mode,\u201d said Avivah Litan, an analyst and research vice president at Gartner.\n\n\u201cBlockchain is not yet enabling a digital business revolution across business ecosystems and may not until at least 2028, when Gartner expects blockchain to become fully scalable technically and operationally,\u201d Litan added.\n\nBut, it\u2019s not all bad news, Gartner believes that blockchain platforms will be scalable, interoperable, and support smart contract portability and cross-chain functionality by 2023.\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing many developments in blockchain technology that will change the current pattern. By 2023, blockchain platforms will be scalable, interoperable, and will support smart contract portability and cross-chain functionality. They will also support trusted private transactions with the data confidentiality required. Altogether, these technology advances will take us much closer to mainstream blockchain and the decentralized web, also known as Web 3.0,\u201d said Ms. Litan.\n\nGartner has been keeping tabs on blockchain technology for years. In fact, last year the global research firm said interest in blockchain technology was waning.\n\nPrior to that, in May 2016, it noted the technology had reached the peak of its hype cycle, asserting that blockchain was at the stage where users and the public are suffering from \u201cinflated expectations\u201d about its potential benefits.\n\nTo be fair, blockchain technology is still nascent and it\u2019s not unheard of for technologies this young to struggle when it comes to mainstream adoption.\n\nWhile it might be easy to get frustrated by the industry\u2019s slow pace at times, going through the trough of disillusionment is all part of tech reaching a useful state.", "description": "According to Gartner's Hype Cycle, blockchain is \"sliding into the trough of disillusionment,\" meaning the technology is struggling to live up to the hype.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fblockchain.jpg&signature=055707a1063cae7228c78a357f8e5937", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
