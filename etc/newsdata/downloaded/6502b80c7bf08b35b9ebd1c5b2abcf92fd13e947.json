Anthony Davis, LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers will discuss a season of enormous expectations. So will James Harden and Russell Westbrook in Houston, along with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant in Brooklyn.\n\nSacramento and Indiana also open Friday. NBA champion Toronto has media day Saturday, the title-chasing Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday and the rest of the NBA on Monday. And while most teams typically enter a season with high hopes, this year seems as wide-open in terms of the total of realistic championship contenders as any in a long time.\n\n\u201cI talked to at least seven GMs over the summer that really feel that they\u2019re going to go for it,\u201d Washington general manager Tommy Sheppard said Thursday.\n\nThere might even be more.\n\nOver the last 14 seasons, only 10 franchises - Toronto, Golden State, Cleveland, Miami, San Antonio, Oklahoma City, Dallas, the Lakers, Boston and Orlando - have reached the NBA Finals.\n\nThis season, there might be at least 10 with a legitimate chance of getting there.\n\nThe Clippers, with Paul George and reigning NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard, are atop most lists. The Lakers, who haven\u2019t even been to the playoffs since 2012, also seem likely to contend with James and Davis leading the charge. Denver brings most of its team that won 54 games back. Utah figures to be better and has a budding star in Donovan Mitchell. Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Boston and Brooklyn may be atop the East.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s last year\u2019s finalists - the Warriors and Raptors, neither of whom expect to fall too far in the standings despite losing the likes of Durant and Leonard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be the favorite again, to be honest with you,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said.\n\nThey\u2019re not. Most sports books have given that role to the Clippers or Lakers. But the Warriors are still a popular pick among bettors, and in Las Vegas, the odds are showing that the general belief is that plenty of teams have a real chance of being the last club standing when the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy gets handed out in June.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a bettors\u2019 delight, but I would definitely say it\u2019s a bookmakers\u2019 delight,\u201d said Nick Bogdanovich, the director of trading for bookmaker William Hill US. \u201cYou want parity. That\u2019s why the NFL has been so good to bookmakers over the last 25 years; there\u2019s parity. This year, the NBA is definitely much more open.\u201d\n\nOn William Hill\u2019s current books, the Lakers - always very popular among Las Vegas bettors, since the city has tons of their fans - and the Clippers are co-favored at 7-2. There are eight teams at odds of no more than 15-1, which is roughly where eventual champion Toronto was at this time last season.\n\n\u201cThat means eight teams seem to have a really good puncher\u2019s chance,\u201d Bogdanovich said.\n\nEven some of the teams not in that mix figure to carry hope into the new year.\n\nFor the first time in nine years, Oklahoma City isn\u2019t one of the 10 teams with the shortest preseason odds in Vegas. The Thunder now are among the longest of long shots on the Vegas books - understandable, after trading Westbrook to Houston, George to the Clippers and starting to stockpile tons of future draft picks in a clear sign that a rebuild is beginning.\n\n\u201cThe way I explain this internally is there\u2019s a million ways for things to go wrong in the NBA,\u201d Thunder general manager Sam Presti said. \u201cThere\u2019s really only one way for it to go right. It only goes right for one team. You know, you want to be that one team, and you want to strive and do everything you can. But you\u2019ve got to be really smart about how you get there.\u201d\n\nSheppard is also quick to point out that preseason speculation guarantees nothing. The Warriors were overwhelming favorites last year, then fell in the finals after Durant and Klay Thompson went down with injuries.\n\nAnd after a summer of wild player movement, a certain amount of unpredictability would seem plausible.\n\n\u201cA lot of the teams\u2019 jerseys are the same on the front, but the name on the back is different,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cIt changes how you are, chemistry-wise. So I think a lot of teams that are really excited and going for it, they have to be able to factor in what happens during the season. The names look great on paper, but the game is played on wood, and it\u2019s always been that way.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Howard Fendrich in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA coverage: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Farewell, offseason.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Reynolds"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/nba_tariffs_basketball_82972_c0-107-2554-1596_s1770x1032.jpg?5d8ded0a198302c45130a505bd28f2b50340ea2d", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
