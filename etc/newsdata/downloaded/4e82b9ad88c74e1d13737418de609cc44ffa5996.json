Biden also hammered away at his theme that his health care platform wouldn\u2019t disrupt the coverage for the many millions of Americans who currently have health benefits provided by their employers.\n\n\u201cThe 160 million people who like their health care now, they can keep it. If they don\u2019t like it, they can leave,\u201d Biden said.\n\nAmong the 10 contenders on the stage at Texas Southern University, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are the lone remaining full-throated supporters of erecting a single-payer \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care system that would replace a system that mixes private coverage for most working-age adults with public programs for the elderly and the poor.\n\nSanders and Warren emphasized the ways health insurance companies deny care to policyholders and vowed that middle-class people who see lower costs under a single-payer program, even if the money they spend will be in the form of taxes rather than insurance premiums. Sanders authored the legislation to create Medicare for All, which Warren has endorsed during the campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI\u2019ve met people who like their doctors. I\u2019ve met people who like their nurses. I\u2019ve met people who like their pharmacists. I\u2019ve met people who like their physical therapists. What they want is access to health care.\u201d\n\nBiden, the front-runner in the campaign for the Democratic Party nomination so far, is among those candidates who have backed a smaller but still substantial increase in the federal government\u2019s role in providing health care to Americans. Among other things, Biden has proposed creating a government-run public option program people could choose as an alternative to private insurance.\n\nAs it has from the beginning of this election cycle, the finer points of these two approaches were mostly overshadowed by a dispute over whether to build on private health insurance, as transformed already by the Affordable Care Act, to make coverage more affordable and fair or whether the solution to high costs and poor benefits is to follow the rest of the developed world\u2019s lead and establish a single program for everyone.\n\nBiden and other candidates, including Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), have based their case largely on limiting costs preserving choice and allowing Americans to decide whether to select private insurance or the public option.\n\n\u201cHow are we going to pay for it? I want to hear tonight how that\u2019s happening,\u201d Biden said.\n\nFor Sanders and Warren, the principles of guaranteeing lifelong access to stable, government-provided health benefits trump the notion of choice.\n\n\u201cInstead of paying premiums into insurance companies and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage, we\u2019re going to do this by saying everyone is covered by Medicare for All,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThe only question here in terms of difference is where to send the bill.\u201d\n\nThese two candidates also see higher taxes on wealthy households and businesses as a principle of their own and a means to reduce inequality while also financing medical care. Sanders in particular has long held that profit motives in the health care industry pervert the system by prioritizing financial considerations over providing care.\n\n\u201cWe need a health care system that guarantees health care to all people, as every other major country does, not a system which provides $100 billion a year in profit to the drug companies and the insurance companies,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nPolling suggests that Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independents are open to Medicare for All, but more of them support the incremental approach favored by Biden and the other candidates.\n\nAccording to Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation survey results published Thursday, given a choice between building on the Affordable Care Act and replacing the private insurance system, 55% of those voters support the more incremental approach and 40% support the more sweeping plan.\n\nBut these voters also appear open to supporting either of these approaches, according to the poll, which was conducted last week. Among Democrats, 87% support a public option, while 77% support Medicare for All. Notably, 41% of Republicans also expressed support for a public option and 20% favored Medicare for All.", "description": "\"I've actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company,\" Elizabeth Warren says as Joe Biden vows stability for currently insured Ameri...", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7aebf9240000122778e977.jpeg?cache=qgzc5brvxn&ops=1778_1000"}
