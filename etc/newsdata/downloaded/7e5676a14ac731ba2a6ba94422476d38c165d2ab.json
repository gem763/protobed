Speaking after Pentland\u2019s ruling, Maugham said the appeal was based on one key question: \u201cWhether the court is right to expect the prime minister to comply with the law.\u201d\n\nThey will reinforce that argument by also asking the judges to consider taking control of the process by using unique powers available to the inner house, known as nobile officium, which empowers judges to take action in a situation where a remedy is needed.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the campaigners\u2019 advocate, will ask the court to use their nobile officium powers to write the letter required under the Benn act on Johnson\u2019s behalf if he fails to do so in time.\n\nLast Friday, lawyers for the advocate general, the UK government\u2019s Scottish law officer, failed to get that application thrown out.\n\nDrummond-Young said the case was unique but it had to be heard soon to ensure it could be properly dealt with, since it was likely to be appealed at the UK supreme court by whichever side loses. The courts had very little time to deal with this, given Brexit day was due on 31 October, he said.\n\nTo the campaigners\u2019 surprise, Pentland ruled that statements by the prime minister and Downing Street officials that the UK would still leave the EU on 31 October regardless of the Benn act were political statements. Pentland also said the applicants had not proven that Johnson would breach the act by subverting it.\n\nAt a key point in Friday\u2019s hearing, O\u2019Neill told Pentland that the BBC had just quoted a Downing Street source arguing the Benn act\u2019s \u201cvery specific narrow duty\u201d did not prevent the government from \u201cother communications, private and public\u201d arguing against any delay.\n\nO\u2019Neill told the court this was evidence of the government\u2019s \u201cspin, misunderstanding and misinterpretation\u201d of the act. It was proof, he said, that No 10 could not be trusted to honour the promises that government lawyers had given the court.", "description": "Lawyers to appeal against ruling that courts had to trust promises made over Benn act", "authors": ["Severin Carrell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e342730219479984994b4a478f4b2aa8769f1d0/0_19_1943_1166/master/1943.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3162ffb442e0b9ff5586c0fd81c8006f", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
