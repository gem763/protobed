He was 95.\n\nHis death was confirmed by Eva Rotter, managing director of the Vienna International Film Festival, which Mr. Pleskow had led as president since 1998. She said Mr. Pleskow developed respiratory problems about two weeks before his death.\n\nAs a studio head, Mr. Pleskow was responsible for two of the only three films to receive all five major Academy Awards, \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d (1975) and \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d (1991). He was also credited with building his companies into havens for independent-minded directors, granting wide creative latitude to filmmakers such as Woody Allen and Jonathan Demme.\n\n\u201cSometimes I felt like the Medici,\u201d Mr. Pleskow once said, referring to the Florentine political dynasty that lorded over a flourishing Italian art scene.\n\nRaised in Vienna, where his family\u2019s home was seized by the SS after the Nazi annexation of Austria, Mr. Pleskow launched his movie career with help from a streak of remarkable good fortune. In 1939, his family took what he described as \u201cvirtually the last train\u201d out of town, traveling to Paris and on to New York City, where his mother got a job sewing curtains for a documentary film production.\n\nMr. Pleskow, a teenager, was hired as a secretary at the movie company. His English skills were limited, his film experience nonexistent. But he rose from coffee boy to assistant editor and, after being drafted into the Army, was assigned to Gen. Robert A. McClure, a specialist in psychological warfare who noted that Mr. Pleskow had worked in the movie business, albeit briefly.\n\n\n\nA still from the United Artists film \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d (1977), starring Diane Keaton and Woody Allen.

But he signed on and helped rebuild the storied Bavaria Film studio, later used by filmmakers including Elia Kazan, Max Oph\u00fcls and Stanley Kubrick. His work attracted the attention of two entertainment lawyers, Robert Benjamin and Arthur Krim, who in 1951 acquired control of UA \u2014 and, later that year, hired Mr. Pleskow as an executive in the studio\u2019s foreign department.\n\nThe trio formed the core of a management team that resurrected UA from near oblivion, turning what had been a historical but staid Manhattan-based movie company into a profitable, artistically adventurous studio.\n\nFormed in 1919 by Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D.W. Griffith, UA was on the brink of bankruptcy in the early \u201950s, recovered in part with the Pink Panther and James Bond franchises of the 1960s, but was still losing tens of millions of dollars each year by the time Mr. Pleskow was named president in 1973.\n\nLeading the studio into the black, he presided over a string of commercial and artistic hits, beginning with \u201cCuckoo\u2019s Nest,\u201d directed by Czech filmmaker Milos Forman from a novel by Ken Kesey and a play by Dale Wasserman. In Mr. Pleskow\u2019s telling, a treatment for the film had been going around Hollywood for about a decade when he signed on to the project after meeting with Forman, who astonished the producer by showing up in sandals and socks.\n\nThe film\u2019s best-picture win kicked off a three-year streak \u2014 a first in Hollywood history \u2014 in which the studio took home the top Oscar, winning for Sylvester Stallone\u2019s boxing classic \u201cRocky\u201d (1976) and for \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d (1977), starring and directed by Allen.\n\n1 of 58 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year View Photos Remembering those who have died in 2019.

He resigned in 1978 alongside Benjamin, Krim, William Bernstein and Mike Medavoy, who together founded the new studio of Orion.\n\nEstablished as a joint venture with Warner Bros., the studio became a full-fledged production and distribution company in 1982, when Orion acquired the floundering distributor Filmways. Mr. Pleskow maintained the same hands-off production style that made him a favorite of directors at UA, and the studio released the best-picture winners \u201cAmadeus\u201d (1984), \u201cPlatoon\u201d (1986), \u201cDances With Wolves\u201d (1990) and \u201cSilence of the Lambs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one studio that takes on risky projects and nurtures them,\u201d actress and \u201cLambs\u201d star Jodie Foster told the Los Angeles Times in 1990, after Orion gave her the chance to direct her first feature film, \u201cLittle Man Tate.\u201d\n\nDespite its awards haul, the studio struggled financially, failing to score enough hits to offset the losses of movies such as Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cThe Cotton Club\u201d (1984). In 1991, months after \u201cWolves\u201d won seven Academy Awards, Orion filed for bankruptcy. (It was later acquired by MGM.)\n\nMr. Pleskow was effectively stripped of his day-to-day duties that year and served as chairman before resigning in 1992. \u201cWe never had the financial capability that other companies had and whereas we were not unique in having a couple of bad years, others can withstand this better,\u201d he told Variety.\n\nErich Pleskoff was born in Vienna on April 24, 1924, and raised in an elegant building blocks from Sigmund Freud\u2019s office. The family name was later changed, and Mr. Pleskow dropped the \u201ch\u201d from his own given name. His mother was a tailor with Hungarian ancestry, his father a salesman with Russian roots.\n\nIn interviews, Mr. Pleskow recalled that his family\u2019s survival was linked in part to the death of his brother, whose long illness had kept the family from traveling. Were it not for his passing, Mr. Pleskow suggested, he and his parents would have remained in Vienna, caring for the sick boy, and died in a concentration camp.\n\nInstead, they made their way to the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, where Mr. Pleskow was drafted into the Army. His duties included interrogating German prisoners of war such as Otto Skorzeny, an SS officer who had helped free dictator Benito Mussolini from his Italian captors; and filming the execution of 12 guards from the Dachau concentration camp.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t brought up to watch people hanging, regardless of what they did,\u201d Mr. Pleskoff said in a 2014 interview for the Jewish Historical Society of Fairfield County, Conn. \u201cHowever, the only way I was able to deal with this was I figured that each of these guys had at least 50,000 Jewish and other lives on their conscience . . . I never mentioned it to my mother, never mentioned it to my wife for years.\u201d\n\nHis wife, the former Barbara Black, died in 2009. Survivors include two children, Michelle Abt and Tony Pleskow; and four grandchildren.\n\nAfter leaving United Artists, Mr. Pleskow received a producing credit on \u201cBeyond Rangoon\u201d (1995), starring Patricia Arquette, and was an executive producer of \u201cThe Hollywood Sign\u201d (2001), a crime comedy.\n\nIn the Jewish Historical Society interview, Mr. Plesko reflected on growing older, in a home decorated with a shelf-full of awards. \u201cI have a few Oscars in my apartment, and that\u2019s dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cI was short of breath the other night, a few weeks ago, and I had to call the ambulance. And they came in and they saw the Oscars and forgot why they came in.\u201d", "description": "Under his leadership, his studios won seven Academy Awards for best picture, including for \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d and \u201cSilence of the Lambs.\u201d", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jiJawqTEaYSyNNFXbExGAX70Fg4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YVGXM5HGEYI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
