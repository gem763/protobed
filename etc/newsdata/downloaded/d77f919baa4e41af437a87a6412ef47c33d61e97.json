West\u2019s Sunday Service choir performs in all brown Yeezy uniforms that match their skin tones, led by a choir conductor whose presence\u2014with energetic full body movements stretching from structure to sky\u2014is the most compelling of the film. Everyone in Jesus Is King: the Film is black, from West to the choir to his baby son, Chicago, whom West cradles while singing \u201cUse this Gospel.\u201d The film\u2019s visual blackness felt intentional, and I wondered how genuine or cynical the choice was.\n\nBlack people are at the core of the gospel, our heritage and varied experiences, but also our colonization, the fact that many of us worship a Christian God in the first place. The black church birthed rock \u2019n\u2019 roll with Sister Rosetta Sharpe, its godmother, stomping through the church doors and out into the secular streets with God\u2019s message, guitar in hand. But West, in many ways, has abandoned a collective understanding of varied black experiences for a bootstrap-pulling individualist\u2019s redemptive journey to the sun. The audience in the Camarillo, Calif. IMAX theater where I saw the film was mostly white and Asian. At the end of the screening, I looked around as everyone exited the theater, and as far as I could see, I was the only black person there. In L.A., the black population is much larger than in the suburbs; still, I wondered what those theaters would look like.\n\nThen, as I turned what I saw over and over in my head, the album dropped. It was somehow shorter than the film, and easier to read.\n\nWhen West released The Life of Pablo in 2016, he likened it to a gospel album, except \u201cwith a whole lot of cursing.\u201d The album\u2019s hit song, \u201cUltralight Beam,\u201d became the soundtrack to the collage-style video \u201cLove Is the Message\u2026 the Message Is Death\u201d by the transformative filmmaker and artist Arthur Jafa. During a screening of the video I attended in 2017 in Harlem, Jafa explained the idea of \u201cushering\u201d to a captive, mostly white audience. In black churches, there are ushers, who help people into their seats and up the aisles, but also assist churchgoers when the spirit moves them and they lose control of their bodies. Ushering, Jafa explained, can also be done artistically; you can make the space for experience, aid its conditions.\n\n\u201c No matter how mad black people are at him for donning his MAGA hat, West\u2019s comparison of his cultural condition to slavery is misguided. \u201d\n\nUnlike The Life of Pablo, the album Jesus Is King has no cursing and no explicit references to sex, though that\u2019s not necessarily its trouble. The conflict between Godliness and hedonism, the Lord and money, church and popular culture, the Bible and Nike\u2014these were the tensions of West\u2019s work before he was saved. Of course, those tensions have apparently led him to celebrating the deeply corrupt and racist President Trump, citing his \u201cdragon energy\u201d; proclaiming in TMZ\u2019s offices that \u201cslavery was a choice\u201d; and refusing to apologize for any of it even after retreating from his association with \u201cBlexit\u201d advocate Candace Owens. West attributes this turn of spirit\u2014or energy\u2014to his independence, and his right as a black person to believe and advocate for whatever he wants. Still, it has been supremely disappointing to many of his fans who felt affinity when his political activism was in the name of the marginalized, such as the predominantly black survivors of Hurricane Katrina, the gay people often lampooned in rap songs, and the young, black victims of gun violence in Chicago. Now West\u2014following in the footsteps of his \u201cBig Brother\u201d Jay-Z\u2014chiefly takes up the cause of himself.\n\nTo be fair, like his idol Lauryn Hill, West has a firsthand understanding of what it means for people who don\u2019t know you to feel like you exist for them; West is protesting the court of public opinion. In \u201cClosed on Sunday,\u201d the fourth song on Jesus Is King, he proclaims, \u201cNo more living for the culture/ We nobody\u2019s slave.\u201d While he\u2019s obviously referencing his turn away from secular music, there\u2019s also a nod to his recent, controversial politics. West is not the first black person with conservative ideas to claim that their conservatism constitutes a freedom of thought and principled refusal to be blindly allegiant to the Democratic Party. Owens and her followers tout this thinking, as does Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, the film critic Armond White, HUD Secretary Ben Carson, and perhaps\u2014for the black folks reading this\u2014one of your aunties, third cousins, or affluent West African uncles. Though in relatively tiny numbers, black conservatives exist, and many of them believe they are in chains. But no matter how much pain fame has brought him as a black artist, no matter how mad black people are at him for donning his MAGA hat, West\u2019s comparison of his cultural condition to slavery is misguided. And more than his God himself, that misguidedness seems to have determined the vision for this album.\n\nIn an interview with Apple Music radio DJ Zane Lowe, West said he asked unmarried collaborators to stay celibate during the making of Jesus Is King. (The musical artist Ciara fulfilled a similar request from her husband, Russell Wilson, who wanted them to abstain from sex throughout their engagement. Black Twitter and gossip blogs like Bossip had many a take on this betrothal.) This would seem to be the closest West will get to collective refusal. In \u201cHands On,\u201d West raps, \u201cTold the Devil that I\u2019m going on strike/ I\u2019ve been working for him my whole life.\u201d West\u2019s new contract is with God, and anyone who has a contract with West reports to Him now, too.\n\nI must confess: I am not a religious person, though from time to time I do send prayers\u2014or desperate pleas\u2014to a \u201csecular god,\u201d maybe a cosmic force or constellation. But I have known religious people well: family who go to church, pray at their bedsides every night, ask me to pray, stray, sin, are saved, have Yolanda Adams albums on repeat, Joel Osteen tapes in the car. These people have rarely requested my fervent participation; I have been allowed to remain aloof, yet they remain there to usher if needed. So, the culture of religiousness I know, and in some ways, understand: the high arc of emotion that descends upon believers, and the secondhand spirit that may touch us heathens. But what West does with Jesus Is King does not resemble the most compelling parts of what I see in the devout I know well and love. Instead, the album is West\u2019s own, personal salvation, tensions be damned (West even raps, \u201cclosed on Sundays / you my Chick-fil-a\u201d\u2014economics and Jesus have found equilibrium). Though, hey, maybe if you refuse pre-marital sex whenever you listen to his album, you, too, can be saved.", "description": "Kanye West compares the cultural condemnation he receives for his conservative views to being enslaved.
