It generated $8.4 billion in sales in Amazon\u2019s latest quarter and its operating income was up 29% to $2.1 billion, the company said in July.\n\nAccording to research firm Gartner Inc., Amazon\u2019s $15.5 billion in annual cloud-services sales last year represented roughly half of total revenue across the cloud-computing market. Microsoft Corp. , Amazon\u2019s closest rival in the cloud market, accounts for an estimated 15% of cloud-market sales, Gartner said. Microsoft launched its Azure cloud service in 2010.\n\nIn Amazon\u2019s early days, Mr. Vogels said, its IT efforts were hamstrung by a \u201cmonolithic\u201d software and database system designed to sell books online and nothing else.\n\nMr. Vogels, who joined Amazon in 2004 as director of systems research and become CTO the following year, recently shared highlights of the company\u2019s ongoing tech evolution with CIO Journal, starting with the key years after the 1995 debut of Amazon\u2019s online bookstore.\n\nBreaking IT Into Pieces\n\nBy 2000, adding new applications to serve Amazon\u2019s growing number of retail customers, among other emerging services, involved rewriting vast amounts of computer code, Mr. Vogels said.\n\n\u201cWe basically had one big piece of software and a whole set of databases related to it that were holding us back from moving faster,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cany changes made to the database needed to go through 10 levels of approvals, because so many things would be impacted by it.\u201d\n\nTimeline: Amazon\u2019s Cloud Evolution Steps that the company took in its early days to manage its growing IT infrastructure became the drivers for Amazon Web Services. Here are debut dates for some key AWS products. 2006: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)\n\nAmazon Simple Storage Service (S3) 2008: Elastic IPs; Elastic Block Store for Amazon EC2; Amazon CloudFront\n\nElastic IPs; Elastic Block Store for Amazon EC2; Amazon CloudFront 2014: EC2 Container Service\n\nEC2 Container Service 2016: Amazon Rekognition\n\nAmazon Rekognition 2017: AWS DeepLens\n\nDeveloping new features such as Amazon Prime, launched in 2005, would have involved multi-year projects\u2014a pace of innovation that would make the company vulnerable to more nimble competitors, Mr. Vogels said.\n\n\u201dWe realized we needed to give our teams a bit more independence, and the only way to do that was to break off this big monolith into little pieces,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company began by separating out its three largest data sets\u2014customers, goods and orders\u2014into separate items, he said. Each of these items was broken down into smaller units, such as login information or security requirements, he said.\n\nThat enabled the company\u2019s information-technology teams to change one area of IT without having to rework the entire system, Mr. Vogels says.\n\n\u2018Two-Pizza Teams\u2019\n\nBreaking down its software architecture drove other efficiencies, Mr. Vogels said.\n\nRather than having a few large development teams working on sections of the same application, the new model allowed much smaller teams to tackle specific products, services or features, he said. The company called these \u201ctwo-pizza teams,\u201d or groups small enough to be fed by two pizzas.\n\nBut despite the new structure, the pace of innovation was still hampered as each of these new teams devoted time to maintaining their data centers.\n\n\u201cThey were all spending time managing their load balances or acquiring capacity and releasing it again, and that became much more of a heavier load as the organization grew,\u201d Mr. Vogels said.\n\nTo lighten that load, he said, the company developed a \u201cshared services platform\u201d around IT capacity, storage and security. By making internal IT infrastructure a shared system, teams were able to focus on creating innovative new services.\n\nThe new system sparked the development of millions of new features every year, up from a few dozen, Mr. Vogels said.\n\nIT Is Getting Cloudy\n\nAlongside these internal initiatives, the company opened up its catalog of products to upstart tech ventures, allowing them to develop their own innovative ways of selling products online through Amazon.com, such as comparison-shopping apps, Mr. Vogels said.\n\n\u201cBut most of these companies failed because they couldn\u2019t meet the IT requirements,\u201d he added.\n\nTaking a page from its internal strategy, Mr. Vogels said, Amazon began offering these ventures the computer systems and tools needed to power their ideas\u2014by renting IT infrastructure and applications online.\n\n\u201cThat was the driver for what later became AWS,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com", "description": "The company\u2019s dominance in cloud computing is the result of early struggles with its information-technology system as the e-commerce giant sought to expand beyond online book sales, a top executive said.", "authors": ["Angus Loten", "Angus.Loten Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103664/social"}
