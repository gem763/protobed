To announce their funding and vision to create the unmanned store of the future, Bodega briefed a number of journalists on its big idea. Given the simplicity of its product \u2014 a tech-enabled vending machine, in essence \u2014 the team was blindsided by the uproarious response that followed. September 13, 2017 was supposed to be the most exciting day in the startup\u2019s history, at least until that point; instead, it was a nightmarish lesson in poor branding and messaging.\n\nWhy do tech wizards keep thinking of new and more horrible ways to avoid dealing with people? -CityLab, September 13, 2017\n\nThe press storm and public lambasting catapulted Bodega into the limelight \u2014 for all the wrong reasons. Overnight, the company went from just another early-stage commerce business to the symbol of everything that is wrong with Silicon Valley. Many wondered if it would fall victim to criticism and crumble like Juicero, a well-financed startup that sold a $400 juicer \u2014 that is, until a Bloomberg story proved its juice packets could be squeezed by hand, no machine necessary. Or would it take the public condemnation in stride, hearing out the critics and amending its brand as necessary?\n\nTwo years after its ill-fated launch, the latter seems to be true. Today, the three-year-old Oakland-based company \u2014 now known as Stockwell \u2014 is said to be growing quickly thanks to more than $45 million in venture capital funding from a number of deep-pocketed investors, the company has confirmed to TechCrunch.\n\nPublic outcry\n\n\u201cBodega is either the worst named startup of the year, or the most devious,\u201d wrote The Verge in the fall of 2017. \u201cTech firm markets glorified vending machines where users can buy groceries,\u201d said The Guardian. The Washington Post dubbed the company \u201cAmerica\u2019s most hated start-up.\u201d CityLab, which writes about issues impacting cities, bluntly reported \u201cBodega, a Startup for Disrupting Bodegas, Is Terrible,\u201d followed by 30 reasons why the startup sucks: \u201cMaybe a Bodega can stock Soylent to appeal to people who also think that eating delicious food is a grim burden,\u201d CityLab wrote. \u201cWhy do tech wizards keep thinking of new and more horrible ways to avoid dealing with people? How come they hate being human?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say Bodega endured one of the most catastrophic company launches in the history of tech startups. But the press cycle surrounding Bodega was more than an attack on the startup alone. It represented a greater frustration with Silicon Valley culture and its reputation for funding \u201cdisruptive\u201d products devoid of impact. Time and time again, VCs had proven their willingness to inject millions into standard concepts lacking originality. A juicer had raised more than $100 million, after all, scooters were beginning to attract private capital and Soylent, which sells a meal replacement drink fit for techies, was hot off the heels of a $50 million round.\n\nA mini-fridge equipped with computer vision technology boasting a culturally insensitive name wasn\u2019t going to change the world. Questioning why it had the support of VCs was only fair.\n\nWeird that they're calling this heinous vending machine \"Bodega\" and not \"Gentrification Box\" https://t.co/xPCozclRRD \u2014 Tristan Cooper (@TristanACooper) September 13, 2017\n\nAn innocent misunderstanding?\n\nBehind the upsetting name was a business developing hundreds of five-foot-wide pantry boxes to be housed in luxury apartment lobbies, offices, college campuses, gyms and more. Similar to Amazon Go, the \u201csmart stores\u201d recognize what customers remove from the cases using computer vision and automatically charge the credit card associated with the account.\n\nWhen you\u2019re not in the room, the name of your company is what gets passed between people. -James Currier, NFX .\n\nBodega was founded by a pair of Google veterans, Paul McDonald and Ashwath Rajan. It had all the ingredients for a successful startup stew. Founders with years of experience in big tech: McDonald spent more than a decade at Google; Rajan had just finished up the search engine\u2019s competitive associate product manager program. Both attended top universities: University of California -Berkeley and Columbia University, respectively. Still, neither of the two men nor their investors seemed to have predicted the controversy afoot.\n\n\u201cBodega doesn\u2019t want to disrupt the bodega,\u201d Hunter Walk, a Bodega investor and co-founder of the seed fund Homebrew, wrote in a 2017 blog post. \u201cSome instances of today\u2019s press coverage suggested that element, a sound bite which, exacerbated by Bodega\u2019s naming, pissed people off as another example of tech startups being at best tone-deaf, and at worst, predatory \u2026 It didn\u2019t occur to me that some people would see the word and associate its use in this context with whitewashing or cultural appropriation.\u201d\n\nThe company, too, quickly authored a blog post outlining their thought process behind the name: \u201cRather than disrespect to traditional corner stores \u2014 or worse yet, a threat \u2014 we intended only admiration,\u201d McDonald wrote.\n\ncurrent startup trend of \"we'll install our narrow-purpose kiosk somewhere & not pay anyone\" is extremely dark https://t.co/jgSGVDuxuA \u2014 Jeff Sisson (@saranrapjs) September 13, 2017\n\nAfter penning blog posts, the founders continued working on the company under the provocative and upsetting name. Meanwhile, investors seemed unfazed by the negative press, evidenced by the company\u2019s ability to continue raising venture capital funding. After all, many of the best businesses endure the wrath of bloggers, competing founders and the general public. As for VCs, high-risk bets are just part of the ball game.\n\nDCM Ventures, a U.S.-based venture capital fund with offices in Beijing, Tokyo and Silicon Valley, was the first to agree to invest in Bodega following the PR disaster. The firm, an investor in Lime, Hims and SoFi, led a $7.5 million Series A financing in the business in early 2018, the company confirmed. DCM co-founder and general partner David Chao joined the company\u2019s board following the deal. DCM vice president David Cheng is also actively involved with the company, according to his bio.\n\nFinally, after pocketing nearly $10 million in total funding, Bodega announced a name change: \u201cDid you buy something today from a Bodega?\u201d Bodega\u2019s McDonald wrote. \u201cYou may have noticed that we\u2019ve changed our name to Stockwell . Our new name is one of the changes we\u2019re making as we expand our offerings and open more stores around the country.\u201d\n\nA new era\n\nWith a new logo and a toned-down, somewhat bland identity, Stockwell had a fresh start and, soon, more attention from top VCs. In late 2018, the company raised a $35 million round of funding co-led by Uber and Slack-backer GV, formerly known as Google Ventures, and NEA, an investor known for bets in Coursera, MasterClass and OpenDoor, Stockwell has confirmed. NEA\u2019s Amit Mukherjee and GV\u2019s John Lyman joined Stockwell\u2019s board as part of the deal, which is said to have valued the business at north of $100 million. Stockwell, however, declined to confirm the figure.\n\nInstead of announcing the news via TechCrunch, Venture Beat, Forbes or another tech publication, as is the norm for fast-growing consumer-facing startups, Stockwell remained mum on financing events and scaling plans, assumedly burned by the press and the public\u2019s scorn a year prior.\n\nRather than subject itself to continued scrutiny as it attempted to rewrite its narrative, Stockwell was heads down, iterating, expanding and quietly raising millions. Bad press can break a startup, and given the sheer number of negative reports on Stockwell so early on, the company had already defied the odds. Keeping a low profile was undoubtedly the best strategy moving forward, and it seems to have paid off.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult time and transition and we learned a lot from it,\u201d a spokesperson for Stockwell said in an email to TechCrunch. \u201cAs a company, we put our heads down and focused on building our business. We kept a low profile and concentrated on our core product, the mission, and the people who work for us. We\u2019re excited for the progress we\u2019ve made but won\u2019t forget the path that got us here.\u201d\n\nToday the company counts 1,000 \u201cstores\u201d in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Houston and Chicago. Stockwell has used its latest infusion of funding to explore shared ownership models, i.e. the opportunity for anyone to run their own Stockwell store. The company tells TechCrunch they are also working on building out their \u201cunique curation model,\u201d which allows customers to help determine what items are stocked in their local \u201cstore,\u201d as well as their support for emerging brands, whose products they can stock in their next-generation vending machines.\n\nSo what\u2019s in a name?\n\nHuman beings make snap judgments, evaluate products quickly and can develop distaste for brands in a matter of seconds. A company\u2019s moniker is their first opportunity to impress customers.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re not in the room, the name of your company is what gets passed between people,\u201d writes NFX co-founder James Currier. \u201cIt speaks for you when you\u2019re not there \u2026 It sets expectations of your company in the blink of an eye. And first impressions are hard to change. Both positive and negative.\u201d\n\nMost cases of poor startup naming are easily fixed. Most founders aren\u2019t forced to bear the brunt of the internet\u2019s fury. The case of Bodega is much more extreme and, as such, serves as the ultimate lesson for founders searching for the best way to tell their story. At the end of the day, avoiding a complete and total train-wreck is easy if you include a diverse group of people in the naming process and remember there\u2019s a lot in a name \u2014 if that weren\u2019t the case, Bodega would still be Bodega.", "description": "The startup \u2014 now Stockwell \u2014 is backed by GV, NEA and DCM Ventures.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/stockwell-bodega.jpg?w=753", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
