The BBC referred to the anti-government protests as the country's largest in five years.\n\nLast week, Lebanon's government approved sweeping reforms in response to the protests. The country's Prime Minister Saad Hariri told reporters that a 2020 budget had been approved which sought to reduce the country's national deficit and added no new taxes.\n\nTop officials, including legislators and members of parliament, also had their salaries halved as part of the economic reform package.\n\nOn Sunday, the eleventh day of mass protests, protesters blocked roads and brought the country to a standstill, according to Al Jazeera.\n\nDrone footage of the event shows scores of people waving flags and cheering across major roads and intersections.\n\n#Lebanon ????: drone video of the human chain that spread north to south for over 170 km.#\u00d9\u201e\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9\u2020\u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u2020_\u00d9\u0160\u00d9\u2020\u00d8\u00aa\u00d9\u0081\u00d8\u00b6 pic.twitter.com/UjbMwDQTFu \u2014 Thomas van Linge (@ThomasVLinge) October 27, 2019\n\n\"All the Lebanese people are together on this day and you're going to see how united we are for this cause,\" a protester who participated in the chain told Al Jazeera.\n\nOther protesters called for complete political reform.\n\n\"We want all of them to resign and end the corruption in this country,\" a protester told Al Jazeera. \"It's enough.\"\n\nAccording to the Guardian, protesters gathered by foot, on bicycle, or on motorbikes to participate in the human chain.\n\nThe stunt follows clashes between soldiers and protesters on Saturday, in which six people were injured in the northern port city of Tripoli after soldiers opened fire on protesters blocking main roads.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "Drone footage of the event shows scores of people waving flags and cheering across major roads and intersections.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7982/91eafe6978a8495aa16689514fd80025.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
