Hell, even a literal child has bested me this year but honestly, I\u2019m totally ok with Stormi Webster getting done up to look like mum Kylie Jenner at the 2019 Met Gala simply because it\u2019s SO CUTE.\n\nTrue this might be the only time of year that I actively look up Heidi Klum\u2018s Instagram, but for the most part, little Stormi has destroyed the competition in a miniature replica version of her mum\u2019s lavender-feather-and-chainmail gown she wore to the Met Gala this year.\n\nLOOK AT HER. Wig and all! I can\u2019t deal. It\u2019s impossibly adorable. Potentially illegally so.\n\nThat actually might be the exact same wig that Kylie wore to the Gala in the first place, now that I\u2019m thinking about it.\n\nHeaven\u2019s knows what they\u2019ve dressed Stormi up like this for, I can\u2019t imagine trick or treating around the neighbourhood would be particularly fun in a floor-length baby gown that\u2019s covered in ostrich feathers. And how many lollies can you even fit in that glittery clutch, like, three?\n\nNo thanks, chuck me in a stretchy Spiderman costume and let me take a pillowcase with me for bulk candy and maximum movement/running around screaming.\n\nFans were quick to notice Stormi\u2019s face in one of the photos, which looks like she\u2019s extremely not stoked on wearing an itty bitty version of Mum\u2019s gown, and reacted accordingly.\n\nU know damnnnn well she ain\u2019t wanna be this ???? \u2014 ????
