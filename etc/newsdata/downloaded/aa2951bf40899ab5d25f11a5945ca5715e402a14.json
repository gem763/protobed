Then the 21-year-old phenom mimicked Bregman by taking his bat with him before throwing it down at first base, just as Bregman had done four innings earlier.\n\nWhat did Bregman think about that?\n\n\u201cI deserved it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my fault and I apologize for doing it. I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\n\nManager AJ Hinch weighed in on the bat-carrying antics of both players.\n\n\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t carry the bat past first base,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cSoto shouldn\u2019t carry it to first base, either.\u201d\n\nThough not a hit with Hinch, many fans and others on social media enjoyed the unconventional celebration and lauded Bregman for having fun.\n\nDespite that, Bregman lamented getting caught up in the moment and wanted everyone to know that he regretted what he\u2019d done.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what I\u2019m about,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to play team baseball and try and help this team win. And I just got too excited, and I apologize to their team, my teammates, everybody and I just want to come out and try to help this team win a game tomorrow.\u201d\n\nGame 7 is Wednesday night in Houston.", "description": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Alex Bregman knocked a home run into the Crawford Boxes in the first inning of Game 6 of the World Series on Tuesday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Eric-Gay1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
