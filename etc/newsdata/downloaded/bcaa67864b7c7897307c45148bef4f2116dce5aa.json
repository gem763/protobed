Scores. SCREAMER.\"\n\nRashford has now scored four goals in his last four games in all competitions for United, and is their top goalscorer with seven goals in total.\n\nSolskjaer also agreed with Lindelof's Ronaldo comparison after the game.\n\n\"It was very Cristiano-like,\" he said. \"The boy has nerves of steel. He takes a penalty no problem, and then steps up and hits the ball like he did and wins us the game. Fantastic.\"\n\nUnited are also on a good run of form, having won three and drawn one in their last four games, and will look to continue putting pressure on the top four when they take on Bournemouth on Saturday.", "description": "The Swedish defender compared Rashford to a former Manchester United hero following his sensational winner against the Blues", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20761695.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Chelsea-FC-v-Manchester-United-Carabao-Cup-Round-of-16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
