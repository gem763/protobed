The impeachment hearings have to be held in public by the House Judiciary Committee. This is the initial interview of witnesses to see what they have to say, to determine whether or not they are even worthy of presenting evidence of impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019ll continue to go on and on and on until they find something on the president, right?\u201d Ainsley Earhardt chimed in.\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s what police and prosecutors do,\u201d Napolitano explained. \u201cThey come to a conclusion that the person is probably guilty and then they look for evidence to either support or negate that. That\u2019s what Congressman Schiff is doing and he\u2019s following the rules\u2014as frustrating as those rules are.\u201d", "description": "Fox News\u2019 judicial analyst disappointed his colleagues by explaining there\u2019s nothing wrong with \u201csecret\u201d impeachment hearings.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571930450/JN_drhsit", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
