REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo\n\nZURICH (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate HNA Group repeatedly provided false reports about the real owners of its former stake in duty free group Dufry (DUFN.S), Swiss markets watchdog FINMA said, calling it a \u201cserious breach of disclosure obligations\u201d.\n\n\u201cFINMA will be registering a complaint with the Criminal Law Division of the Federal Department of Finance,\u201d the markets supervisor said on Wednesday. It concluded that HNA submitted six incorrect reports to the SIX Swiss Exchange between April 2017 and February 2019.\n\nFINMA\u2019s report marks the latest instance in which Swiss officials have found fault in HNA Group\u2019s reporting after concluding in 2017 that the Chinese travel conglomerate gave \u201cuntrue\u201d details during its takeover of airline caterer Gategroup.\n\nHNA sold Gategroup this year to RRJ Capital, but owns Swiss cargo handling unit Swissport.\n\nWith Dufry, FINMA found HNA Group Chairman Feng Chen and former co-Chairman Jian Wang, who died in 2018 after suffering a fall while traveling in France, should have been named as the shareholders behind the Dufry stake, not the Hainan Province Cihang Foundation that they founded.\n\nFINMA Enforcement Division Chief Patric Eymann said Swiss law requires transparent disclosure to ensure fairness for all investors.\n\n\u201cThe market needs transparency when it comes to who is actually behind qualified stakes taken in listed companies,\u201d Eymann said. \u201cThe actual control situation must be disclosed in Switzerland so that the stakeholders in question cannot be concealed through opaque structures and technicalities, as was the case here.\u201d\n\nIn June, the Hainan Province Cihang Foundation reported to the SIX Swiss Exchange that its stake had gone below the 3% threshold, down from more than 20% in February 2018.", "description": "Chinese conglomerate HNA Group repeatedly provided false reports about the real owners of its former stake in duty free group Dufry , Swiss markets watchdog FINMA said, calling it a \"serious breach of disclosure obligations\".", "authors": ["John Miller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433653376&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0CW", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
