He said: \"I don't know, I am quite excited to go out [on tour].\n\n\"It is difficult being on the road, going out and promo-ing. It has been hard to get home and see him. Loads of random things happen with kids all the time.\n\n\"Like if he's not very well, sometimes you miss dates and things. Then a couple of weeks go by, and I haven't seen him in ages.\n\n\"It hurts, I do want to go out on tour, I'm just going to have to figure out the schedule properly.\"", "description": "Cheryl has sprinkled skulls and skeletons around her home as she got into the spirit for Halloween", "authors": ["Lily Waddell", "Image", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20755453.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Cheryls-Halloween.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
