Two of them are ginger, so they have that fair skin that gets all red and blotchy, and I think it\u2019s nice to look a bit smoother. And not look back and think, \u201cOh, my poor face!\u201d\n\n\u2018I would never Photoshop the freckles though.\u2019\n\nDefending her decision, the reality star admitted her kids don\u2019t know she alters their pictures.\n\n\u2018When it\u2019s on the wall I like it to look nice, I\u2019ve got a very nice house. I want them to fit the brand of the house,\u2019 she joked.\n\n\u2018They don\u2019t know, they just think they\u2019re beautiful always, Photoshop or not.\n\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t Photoshop out a scar, or something like that because I wouldn\u2019t want them to be ashamed of anything like that, but for me, there\u2019s a line.\n\n\u2018Anything that was permanent, I wouldn\u2019t Photoshop. I wouldn\u2019t make them thinner, I wouldn\u2019t make their eyes bigger, I wouldn\u2019t do anything like that\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019d whiten their teeth.\u2019\n\nLuisa also explained that wouldn\u2019t ever use an Instagram filter on any pictures of her daughters \u2013 as that is \u2018worse\u2019.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t put my kids on social media either. I\u2019m not one of those mums who has a filter on them which I think is worse,\u2019 she continued.\n\n\u2018I do think there\u2019s a line to it, but for a school photo that you look back on, I think girls especially \u2013 and I\u2019m really conscious raising three girls \u2013 sometimes a little ego boost, sometimes it\u2019s okay not to like things about yourself.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Dawn O\u2019Porter \u2013 who is a mum to two boys with Chris O\u2019Dowd\u2013 argued that her decision is \u2018instilling a bad feeling\u2019 in kids.\n\n\u2018Bad school photos are a rite of passage, I love laughing about mine. They\u2019re so cheesy, they\u2019re so blotchy, they\u2019re so terrible,\u2019 the author explained.\n\n\u2018I would just be worried about that future conversation of, \u201cdidn\u2019t you think I was good enough? I was a child and you didn\u2019t think I was cute.\u201d\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s not instil that feeling.\u2019\n\nAnd viewers at home were divided over the debate, with many berating Luisa for her comments.\n\nFlocking to Twitter, one fumed: \u2018Right now on @GMB Photoshopping your kids school photos!!! I\u2019m speechless, your children are beautiful, they\u2019re your world.\n\n\u2018No wonder there is no self-love with toxic damaged parents like that. What a sad world we live in #gmb.\u2019\n\nWhile another said: \u2018Disgusting to even think about airbrushing your children!!!!\u2019\n\nHowever, more rushed to praise the star for being honest.\n\n\u2018The honesty is real @TheLuluLife absolutely love her @gmb #gmb,\u2019 a viewer posted.\n\n\u2018Wish photoshopping was around when I was in school in secondary school not junior #GMB,\u2019 a Twitter user posted.\n\n\u2018@TheLuluLife raising 2 princesses myself I completely get everything you said on #GMB you came across really well and I totally got everything you said,\u2019 a fan added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGood Morning Britain continues on weekdays, at 6am, on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
