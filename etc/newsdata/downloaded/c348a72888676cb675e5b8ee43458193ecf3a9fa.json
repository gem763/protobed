As a co-venture partner with\n\nthe developer Ecove I believe it is time for SOPA to resolve this situation.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the commercial matters should be dealt with in courts not on construction sites nor at the expense of owners. He also said the conflict was a \"bad look\" for SOPA, Icon and Ecove, in that \"past behaviour was a predictor of future behaviour\".\n\nOpal Tower was evacuated last Christmas eve after cracking sounds were heard, later discovered, through an independent NSW investigation, to be caused by non-compliant construction and structural design.\n\nBut nine months later, not only has remediation not finished, problems at the tower have escalated including unpaid accommodation costs by builder Icon, unrentable units and clashes between tenants and landlords, steep rises in building insurance premiums and general stress endured by many owners and residents whose homes have suffered reputational damage.\n\nAngry owners outside Opal Tower in Sydney Olympic Park. New rules aim to prevent further such building failures. Dominic Lorrimer\n\n\"Owners have missed out on their Christmases last year, we don't want it to happen again,\" the tower's owners' corporation chairman Shady Eskander said.\n\nOwners also told The Australian Financial Review, since July, at least 20 owner-occupiers have not received all reimbursements for prepaid alternative accommodation as promised by builder Icon.\n\nMany owner-investors fared worse and did not get a cent.\n\nOne owner, whose English is limited said she was turned away because Icon said she could not prove she owned or lived in the unit because there were no utilities set up in her name when she had only received keys days before the building was evacuated.\n\nEcove was a brand new building completed four months before it cracked.\n\nIcon and the Mint Bar declined to comment. Retail landlord and developer Ecove said it didn't want to comment as the scaffolding conflict \"was nothing to do with Ecove\".", "description": "David Chandler chastised SOPA for failing to step in over a commercial conflict and unpaid compensation at a ground floor retail shop owned by developer Ecove.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2397%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_132%2C$y_45/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/441bc27a87c9d5661ae7a0ffa05e96d1de418fab", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
