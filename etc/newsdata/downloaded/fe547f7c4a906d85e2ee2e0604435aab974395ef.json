Recent sales declines signal \u201can early chill for retailers,\u201d Diane Swonk, chief economist at professional services firm Grant Thornton, wrote in a Wednesday note to clients.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe consumer is slowing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are looking for a further slowdown in the fourth quarter, but hoping to avoid the panic we saw in December of 2018 when the stock market collapsed and the government was shut down.\u201d\n\nHoliday spending growth slowed to 2.1 percent last year, the lowest level in nearly a decade, as a government shutdown, stock market volatility and new tariffs on Chinese imports took their toll on consumers. The National Retail Federation is anticipating more robust spending this year \u2014 it expects holiday sales will grow in the 3.8 percent to 4.2 percent range \u2014 though it has warned that economic uncertainty, new tariffs and fluctuations in the stock market could negatively affect consumers\u2019 shopping plans in the coming months.\n\n\u201cThere has clearly been a slowdown brought on by considerable uncertainty around issues including trade, interest rates, global risk factors and political rhetoric,\u201d Matthew Shay, chief executive of the National Retail Federation, said earlier this month. \u201cConfidence could be eroded by continued deterioration of these and other variables.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose declines come amid other signs that businesses and consumers are cutting back: U.S. manufacturing has fallen to its lowest level in more than a decade, and auto sales are contracting after seven years of fast growth. There are also signs that job growth is slowing, as businesses pull back on hiring.\n\nIn all, consumers spent $525.6 billion in September, down from $526.9 billion in August. Overall retail spending so far this year, however, is up about 3.4 percent compared with the same period last year.\n\n\u201cSeptember was worse than expected, but growth is still up so far this year,\u201d said Mickey Chadha, a vice president at Moody\u2019s. \u201cDespite slowing growth projections for the remainder of the year, the consumer is still in a pretty strong position.\"\n\nAD", "description": "New figures show that U.S. retail sales slowed in September for the first time in seven months, as consumers spent less on cars, building materials and department store purchases.", "authors": ["Abha Bhattarai", "Reporter Covering The Retail Industry"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HNGlFC67Vn0pIcz7IL_QcvU6zOs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WMHGAPHQCEI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
