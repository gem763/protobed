(AP Photo)\n\nThe dice were already loaded against a meaningful breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks restarting this week.\n\nBut the Trump administration is now moving on multiple fronts to dial up tensions with Beijing, raising the question of whether the two sides can strike even a narrower deal to avoid a looming tariff escalation that will kick the trade war into a higher gear. Tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports are set to rise from 25 percent to 30 percent on Oct. 15. A second hike \u2014 15 percent duties on another $156 billion of Chinese products \u2014 will hit the books on Dec. 15.\n\nJust in the last two days, the White House:\n\nBlacklisted eight Chinese companies core to the country\u2019s ambitions to foster homegrown superiority in the field of artificial intelligence. The Commerce Department pointed to their role suppressing Muslim minority populations in China.\n\nRestricted visas for Chinese officials also involved in that suppression. The move limits the officials\u2019 ability to travel to the U.S.\n\nMoved forward with potential restrictions on U.S. government pension fund investments in Chinese firms.\n\nBeijing pledged to retaliate for the blacklisting of Chinese firms. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said to \u201cstay tuned\u201d for its response. \u201cChina will continue to take firm and forceful measures to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests,\u201d he said.\n\nThe official tit-for-tat is playing out against the backdrop of an even noisier clash between the world\u2019s two largest economies over basketball and free speech. China\u2019s top television broadcaster canceled plans to air two preseason NBA games after the league\u2019s commissioner defended the free speech rights of the Houston Rockets general manager, who set off a firestorm by tweeting support for the pro-democracy movement on Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cUntil fairly recently \u2014 last week, actually \u2014 there was some hope that a comprehensive trade deal between the U.S. and China could be reached in the relatively near future,\u201d economist Karl Smith wrote in a Bloomberg Opinion piece. \u201cThen Chinese and NBA officials showed just how hard it will be.\u201d\n\nWorkers clean up a vandalized Starbucks store in Hong Kong. (Reuters/Susana Vera)\n\nFor those not following the nuts and bolts of the Trump administration\u2019s demands for structural economic reforms from Beijing, the conflict paints in vivid hues the gulf in fundamental values separating the superpowers. \u201cWe voice our strong dissatisfaction and opposition to [NBA Commissioner] Adam Silver offering as an excuse the right to freedom of expression,\u201d the Chinese broadcaster said in a statement. \u201cWe believe that no comments challenging national sovereignty and social stability fall within the scope of freedom of expression.\u201d (Other American companies with extensive business ties to China, meanwhile, are bending over backward not to offend the country's leadership, my colleagues Jeanne Whalen, Ben Golliver and Steven Zeitchik report.)\n\nAnd while the basketball clash may not have a direct bearing on the trade talks, it echoes the human rights concerns the Trump administration is citing in its decisions on blacklisting Chinese firms and restricting visas. The trade showdown was difficult enough when it was limited to a cold-eyed negotiation over comparative advantage in the two-way commerce between the countries. Broadening the terms to include a dispute over human rights may make even a limited truce impossible.\n\nStocks fell on the news of intensifying hostilities, with the S&P 500 shedding 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq slipping 1.7 percent. Caterpillar, \u201coften considered a bellwether for global trade,\u201d fell 1.8 percent, the Wall Street Journal noted.\n\n\u201cWhile equity investors had held out the hope of reaching a mini-deal this week, that is appearing increasingly unlikely,\u201d Beacon Policy Advisors wrote in a note. The firm now gives 60 percent odds that talks later this week between Chinese vice premier Liu He and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer \u201cend with no major announcements, Trump goes forward with his tariff increase from 25 to 30 percent on $250 billion worth of products on October 15, and China halts its purchases of agricultural goods.\u201d\n\nBeijing appears to be downplaying expectations.\n\nThe Chinese delegation may cut its trip to Washington short, returning to China on Friday instead of Saturday, a source briefed on the talks told the South China Morning Post. And an editorial in the Communist Party-controlled Global Times ratcheted down the possibility of a breakthrough. \u201cThere are obviously many trade differences between the two countries, the attitude of the U.S. is not sincere, the area of conflict is growing broader, and strategic mutual distrust is increasing,\u201d it said.\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.

WSJ's Nick Timiraos: \"The Federal Reserve will soon increase its purchases of short-term Treasury securities to avoid a recurrence of the unexpected strains experienced in money markets last month, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday.

As a result, a crucial liability on the balance sheet\u2014bank deposits held at the Fed, called reserves\u2014have continued declining...\n\n\"Mr. Powell emphasized that the coming moves are aimed at maintaining a firm grip on very-short-term lending rates\u2014and not to provide economic stimulus, as the Fed did between 2008 and 2014 by purchasing longer-dated Treasury and mortgage securities in successive campaigns sometimes referred to as quantitative easing, or QE. 'This is not QE,' Mr. Powell said. 'In no sense is this QE.'\"\n\n\u2014 Low-income consumers are struggling. Bloomberg's Claire Boston: \"More U.S. households are struggling financially, especially among lower-income consumers, signaling that a growing number of borrowers could fall behind on their debt, according to UBS. An above-average percentage of consumers -- 44% -- reported incomes that don\u2019t cover their expenses, or barely cover them, according to a quarterly UBS survey of around 2,100 U.S. respondents. That figure has risen by a percentage point over the last year...\n\n\"Just 17% of households reported their financial condition had improved in the last 6 months, down 3 percentage points from a year earlier. Household spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity as measured by gross domestic product.\"\n\nYield curve expert says prepare for a recession: \u201cInvestors, business owners and consumers should be heeding the message that the inverted yield curve is sending, according to the researcher who pioneered the economic forecasting model,\u201d CNBC\u2019s Jeff Cox reports.\n\n\u201cDuke University professor Campbell Harvey said people shouldn\u2019t wait for the economic downturn he anticipates before taking preventive measures.\" Per Harvey: \"This is the time where you need to reflect upon your strategy.

NYT's Ana Swanson: \"The new head of the International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that America\u2019s trade war with China could cost the global economy around $700 billion by 2020 \u2014 a loss equivalent to the size of Switzerland\u2019s entire economy.\n\n\"In her first speech as managing director, Kristalina Georgieva said the global economy had shifted from a synchronized upswing two years ago to a synchronized slowdown, weighed down in part by the pain of [Trump\u2019s] trade war. The fund will be downgrading its projections for global growth in 2019 and 2020 next week, when it releases new projections of the economic losses related to the trade war between the United States and China. 'We have spoken in the past about the dangers of trade disputes,' Ms. Georgieva said. 'Now, we see that they are actually taking a toll.'\"\n\nTRUMP WATCH:\n\nPresident Trump. (Alex Brandon/Associated Press)\n\n\u2014 Trump weighs weakening rules on corporate inversions: \u201cTreasury Department officials are considering rolling back a tax rule aimed at preventing American companies from moving money offshore to avoid U.S. taxes, according to several people familiar with discussions,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Allyson Versprille, Isabel Gottlieb, and Laura Davison report.\n\n\u201cThe Treasury is looking at regulations intended to prevent American firms from lowering their U.S. tax bills by shifting income to their offshore branches that they can loan to their domestic branches and deduct the interest off their Internal Revenue Service bills. The department is also contemplating repealing them entirely to replace them with something more business-friendly.\u201d\n\n\u2014 So much for \u2018Scott free\u2019: \u201cThe Trump Organization\u2019s two Scottish golf courses lost $14.3 million in 2018, extending a multiyear string of losses that have intensified since Donald Trump took office, according to annual financial reports released this month,\u201d my colleague Joshua Partlow reports.\n\n\u201cThe results add further pressure to two of [Trump\u2019s] key overseas investments at a time when the company faces backlashes on many fronts, including customers who shun the president\u2019s family business for political reasons and golf course neighbors upset by the company\u2019s plans to build hundreds of new homes on bucolic farmland.\"\n\nPOCKET CHANGE\n\nBoeing 737 MAX aircraft.

The issue could prolong final vetting of the anticipated changes and may prompt European regulators to withhold their full support when the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ultimately allows the planes back in the air, these people said.\u201d\n\n\u2014 GM strike affects about 150,000 auto workers: \u201cThe prolonged strike at General Motors Co. is estimated to have hit as many as 150,000 workers in the auto industry, a report from research and consulting firm Anderson Economic Group showed,\u201d Reuters\u2019s Dominic Roshan K.L. reports. \u201cThe research firm estimates that the strike has resulted in a $660 million profit hit for GM and more than $412 million in direct wage losses for all employees through the third week of the strike \u2026 The stoppage has also led to $155 million in lost federal income and payroll tax revenue and $9.1 million in lost Michigan income tax revenue.\u201d\n\nIt's not just auto workers. \"From suppliers to shippers to restaurants, the impact of the work stoppage is spreading through the web of businesses whose fates are tied to the biggest American automaker,\" NYT's Nelson D. Schwartz and David Yaffe-Bellany report. \"The most intense economic pain is being felt in the industrial Midwest, where G.M.\u2019s network of plants and suppliers is thickest. It is a difficult time for the region\u2019s manufacturing industry, which even before the strike was contending with slowing auto sales, a weakening global economy and the trade war.\"\n\n\u2014 Trump\u2019s court picks could play big role in major LGBT cases: \u201cThe Supreme Court appeared divided \u2026 about whether federal discrimination laws protect gay and transgender workers, and [Trump\u2019s] appointments to the court could play the pivotal roles in deciding the outcome,\u201d my colleagues Robert Barnes and Ann E. Marimow report.\n\n\u201cThe issue, one of the most significant facing the court this term, concerns the reach of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which, besides protecting against workplace discrimination because of race, religion and other characteristics, also prohibits discrimination \u2018because of sex.\u201d The court has since interpreted that definition to include discriminating on the basis of sex stereotypes.\u201d\n\nMore from inside SCOTUS: \u201cThe arguments touched on some of the most controversial issues of the day \u2014 whether it would mean the end of same-sex bathrooms, whether men should be able to compete on female athletic teams, whether dress codes for men and women would become a thing of the past.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Facebook refuses to take down Trump ad making false claims. NYT's Cecilia Kang: \"The 30-second video ad released by the Trump campaign last week is grainy, and the narrator\u2019s voice is foreboding. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., it says, offered Ukraine $1 billion in aid if the country pushed out the man investigating a company tied to Mr. Biden\u2019s son. Saying it made false accusations, CNN immediately refused to air the advertisement.\n\n\"But Facebook did not, and on Tuesday, the social network rejected a request from Mr. Biden\u2019s presidential campaign to take it down, foreshadowing a continuing fight over misinformation on the service during the 2020 election as well as the impeachment inquiry into [Trump]... The decision by the company illustrates its executives\u2019 hardened resolve to stay out of the moderation of political speech, despite the use of the social network to spread discord and disinformation in the 2016 presidential campaign.\"\n\nCHART TOPPER\n\n\u2014 Economists: American billionaires paid lower tax rates than the working class last year. The Post's Christopher Ingraham: \"A new book-length study on the tax burden of the ultrarich begins with a startling finding: In 2018, for the first time in history, America\u2019s richest billionaires paid a lower effective tax rate than the working class. 'The Triumph of Injustice,' by economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley, presents a first-of-its kind analysis of Americans\u2019 effective tax rates since the 1960s.\n\n\"It finds that in 2018 the average effective tax rate paid by the richest 400 families in the country was 23 percent, a full percentage point lower than the 24.2 percent rate paid by the bottom half of American households. In 1980, by contrast, the 400 richest had an effective tax rate of 47 percent. In 1960, their tax rate was as high as 56 percent. The effective tax rate paid by the bottom 50 percent, by contrast, has changed little over time.\"\n\nSome take issue with the analysis. More from Ingraham: \"Other economists have generated estimates of that distribution that show smaller disparities between the country\u2019s haves and have-nots... On the question of tax burdens, Jason Furman, an economics professor at Harvard who chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, noted that Saez and Zucman did not include refundable tax credits, such as the earned-income tax credit (EITC), in their analysis.\"\n\nDAYBOOK\n\nNote: Congress remains on recess.\n\nUpcoming:\n\nDelta Airlines is among the notable companies reporting its earnings on Thursday, per Kiplinger.\n\nThe American Enterprise Institute hosts an event called \u201cMonetary policy in the 21st century: An Allan Meltzer perspective\u201d on Thursday.\n\nYahoo Finance hosts its \u201cAll Markets Summit\u201d in New York on Thursday, featuring Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman, Merck CEO Kenneth C.
