The women\u2019s symbol has been used by feminists for decades. This is pure cowardice and virtue signalling from these big corporate brands who are capitulating to the trans agenda.\u2019\n\nWomen on social media sites also aired their fury at the decision by P&G.\n\nMaya Forstater, a women\u2019s rights advocate who lost her job as a think tank tax expert for saying transgender women are not women, tweeted: \u2018The venus sign in biology is used to represent the female sex (you know, the ONLY people who will ever need these products). It does not represent gender identity.\u2019\n\nAnother objector, Lizzi Watson, said: \u2018Biological women should just boycott the brand, then they might realise real women have feelings too, which they have somehow ignored.\u2019\n\nThe Always marketing team replied with a comment that Saunders, 18, posted on Twitter, reading: \u2018We are glad to inform you that as of December we will use a wrapper design without the feminine symbol'\n\nA third woman tweeted: \u2018Guess I will also be boycotting @always for throwing females, the ONLY sex that menstruates regardless of clothes or other superficial gender expressions, under the bus.\u2019\n\nIt is the second brand this month to face a boycott from women for bowing to pressure to trans lobbyists.\n\nLast week, The Mail on Sunday reported that the manufacturers of Flora, Upfield, decided to cut ties with Mumsnet after transgender rights campaigners complained it had become a \u2018platform\u2019 for \u2018trans-hostile\u2019 posts.\n\nMumsnet founder Justine Roberts rejected these claims and said it was important for freedom of speech that its users be allowed to debate transgender issues \u2013 such as the growing number of children declaring a wish to change sex.\n\nDozens of mothers who use the website publicly pledged to stop buying Flora or any other products made by Upfield.\n\nP&G, the American company that owns the Always brand, has confirmed that the new sanitary pad packaging without the venus symbol would be introduced across Europe.\n\nA spokesman for the firm said: \u2018For over 35 years, Always has championed girls and women, and we will continue to do so.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re also committed to diversity and inclusion, and we realise that not everyone who has a period and needs to use a pad identifies as female.\n\n\u2018That is why we wanted to ensure that anyone who needs to use a period product feels comfortable in doing so with Always.\u2019", "description": "Outraged women are now boycotting the leading brand after the decision by makers Procter & Gamble (P&G) to kowtow to trans activists who were born female and still use sanitary products.", "authors": ["Sanchez Manning Social Affairs Correspondent For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/00/19940282-0-image-a-48_1571526768795.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
