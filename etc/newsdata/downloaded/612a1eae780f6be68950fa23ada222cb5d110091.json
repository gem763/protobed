Circuit Ruling on Subpoena of Trump Financial Records", "language": "en", "text": "By a 2-1 vote, a D.C. Circuit panel ruled today (in Trump v. Mazars USA) that the House Committee on Oversight Reform had authority to issue a subpoena to an accounting firm for records related to work it did for Donald Trump both before and after he became president. Judge Tatel, joined by Judge Millett, wrote the 66-page majority opinion. Judge Rao penned a 68-page dissent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have not been able to sort through the competing arguments to assess who has the stronger position. Many other folks, however, were able to launch vehement attacks against Judge Rao within minutes of the time the opinion was issued. None of the criticisms I saw provided any evidence that the attackers had actually read Rao\u2019s dissent. So I figure that it would be useful to present a summary of her major arguments:\n\n1. The House has a broad power to investigate for legislative purposes and a distinct and limited judicial power to investigate for purposes of impeachment. \u201cThe text and structure of the Constitution, its original meaning, and longstanding practice demonstrate that Congress\u2019s legislative and judicial powers are distinct and exercised through separate processes, for different purposes, and with entirely different protections for individuals targeted for investigation.\u201d (Dissent at 3.) The power to investigate for legislative purposes cannot be used to circumvent the power to investigate for purposes of impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe Founders treated impeachable offenses as wholly distinct from the subjects of investigation for legislative purposes, such as maladministration.\u201d \u201c[I]mpeachment addresses a public official\u2019s wrongdoing\u2014 treason, bribery, and high crimes or misdemeanors\u2014while problems of general maladministration are left to the political process.\u201d \u201cIn addition, impeachment by the House and trial by the Senate were understood to include constitutional rights normally afforded to the accused in a criminal trial.\u201d (15-16.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWith respect to Congress\u2019s investigative powers, the original meaning and historical practice align\u2014all three branches have consistently distinguished between investigations for legislative purposes and investigations targeting wrongdoing by an impeachable official. Moreover, the historical evidence demonstrates that Congress often begins an investigation into the executive branch with general questions properly pertaining to legislation; however, if an inquiry turns to suspicions of criminality, Congress moves that part of the investigation into impeachment or ends the inquiry into the impeachable official. Thus, even a valid legislative purpose has never been thought to justify probing specific accusations of wrongdoing by impeachable officials.\u201d (19.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee discussion of Founding Era practice (20-23); Jacksonian Era and later 19th-century practice (23-30); and 20th-century and modern practice (30-36).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. The \u201ckey determination is whether [the Committee\u2019s] investigation targets allegations Congress might treat as \u2018high Crimes\u2019 or \u2018Misdemeanors.\u2019\u201d The Committee has consistently stated that its purpose is to investigate \u201cillegal conduct\u201d of the president. The fact that the Committee has also stated an interest in remedial legislation \u201ccannot whitewash this subpoena, which\u2014by the Committee\u2019s own description\u2014targets allegations of illegal conduct by the President.\u201d \u201cThe most important question is not whether Congress has put forth some legitimate legislative purpose, but rather whether Congress is investigating suspicions of criminality or allegations that the President violated a law. Such investigations may be pursued exclusively through impeachment.\u201d \u201cThe Supreme Court has consistently maintained that Congress cannot undertake a legislative investigation of an impeachable official if the \u2018gravamen\u2019 of the investigation rests on \u2018suspicions of criminality.\u2019\u201d (6-8; see also 37-51.)\n\n3. \u201cBy collapsing the distinction between Congress\u2019s legislative and impeachment powers, the majority\u2019s decision has serious consequences for the separation of powers. The decision today expands the legislative power beyond constitutional boundaries, calling into question our precedents for reviewing the scope of congressional investigations; interpreting the legislative power of Congress to subsume the impeachment power; and permitting serious encroachments on the executive branch.\u201d (51; see 51-68.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudge Tatel responds most directly to Judge Rao on pages 45 to 49 of his majority opinion.", "description": "I have not been able to sort through the competing arguments to assess who has the stronger position.
