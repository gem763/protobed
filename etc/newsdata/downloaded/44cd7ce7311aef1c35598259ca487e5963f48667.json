Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) said she favored an impeachment inquiry but did not favor the House impeaching President Trump, providing a different view from her Democrat colleagues onstage at the fourth Democrat debate.\n\n\u201cIf impeachment is driven by these hyper-partisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also pointed out what many Republicans have in the past \u2014 that Democrats have tried to impeach Trump since he won the election.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately this is what we\u2019ve already seen play out as calls for impeachment really began after Trump won his election, and as unhappy as that may make us as Democrats, he won that election in 2016,\u201d she said.\n\nGabbard said, however, \u201cserious issues\u201d have been raised around Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but that the investigation should \u201cplay its course.\u201d\n\n\u201cSerious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House, and I think it should continue to play its course out to gather all the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward,\u201d she said.\n\nShe recognized the political peril Democrats are potentially putting themselves in by supporting impeachment.\n\n\u201cIf the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated, further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford,\u201d she said.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019s @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Rep.
