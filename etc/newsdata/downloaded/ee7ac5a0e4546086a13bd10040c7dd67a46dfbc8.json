Sondland, the blunt-spoken hotelier who is President Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, was boasting on Ukrainian television that Mr. Trump had honored him with a \u201cspecial assignment\u201d \u2014 \u201coverseeing\u201d relations between the two countries \u201cat the highest levels.\u201d\n\nMr. Sondland had arrived in Kiev on July 25, the day of the now-infamous telephone call between President Trump and the new president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky. He had spoken to Mr. Trump minutes before the call, he said, and met with Mr. Zelensky for an hour the next morning, before his television interview.\n\nAt the time, his television remarks might have been the kind of diplomatic bluster one would expect of Mr. Sondland, a big, loquacious man who has been a prominent Republican donor and fund-raiser for years and loves to remind people of the good relationship he has developed with Mr. Trump.\n\nBut in the glare of the impeachment inquiry swirling in Washington, Mr. Sondland\u2019s mission is now being scrutinized in an entirely different light, to assess whether it was to give a lift to American relations with Ukraine, or actually to serve as Mr. Trump\u2019s personal fixer.", "description": "The U.S. ambassador to the European Union says he was given a \u2018\u2018special assignment\u2019\u2019 to handle Ukraine relations, a role now under scrutiny.", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger", "Matina Stevis-Gridneff"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/world/04sondland1/04sondland1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
