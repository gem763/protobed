They expect delivery to grow 150% by 2021.\n\nThat could come at a cost though. \u201cWhile online ordering drives topline growth, it typically comes at the expense of profitability,\u201d wrote Incisiv in the September report. \u201cOther than shipping from distribution centers or drop-shipping by vendors, all other forms of online order fulfillment (third-party deliver, click-and-collect and curbside) negatively impact profit margins.\u201d\n\nAmazon AMZN, -0.45% is in the midst of a major investment in halving Prime delivery from two days to one day.\n\nDuring its third-quarter earnings announcement last week, the company said it had exceeded the $800 million investment it said it would make in the second quarter to speed deliveries. And the investment in delivery and other parts of the company continues.\n\nSee: Amazon earnings miss is the price of growth, analysts say\n\nLandry did not comment on the size of the investment Amazon made to do away with the $14.99 grocery fee, but said the company has a \u201cwillingness to invest in benefits that customers will value.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Landry also called grocery delivery \u201cone of the fastest-growing businesses at Amazon.\u201d When asked for metrics to quantify the growth, Landry didn\u2019t comment, only saying the company thinks we\u2019re \u201cat a turning point for fresh groceries,\u201d in terms of customers\u2019 growing willingness to order groceries online and have them delivered.\n\nWalmart Inc. WMT, -1.22% , Amazon and other grocers are battling to be the most convenient online food seller, with Walmart offering to deliver items directly into shoppers\u2019 fridges.\n\nWalmart reported 37% growth for U.S. e-commerce in its most recent earnings report, including online grocery.\n\n\u201cAs we scaled grocery pickup in the U.S., it unlocked new capabilities like grocery delivery,\u201d said Doug McMillon, chief executive of Walmart, in the earnings announcement. \u201cCustomers love these services, and we\u2019re rapidly expanding them to new locations and testing new options such as unlimited grocery delivery for a fee. And now we\u2019re taking convenience to a new level with InHome Delivery.\u201d\n\nMarketWatch also asked Amazon about the environmental impact of expanding its grocery delivery benefit, but did not receive a response.\n\nShoppers, particularly millennial shoppers, are increasingly concerned about climate change, and are making purchase decisions based on the impact to the environment.\n\nAmazon has taken steps to make delivery more sustainable and recently set a goal to reach Paris Climate Agreement goals 10 years in advance, though the plan has been met with skepticism.\n\nRead: Amazon has \u2018ambitious but achievable\u2019 plan to hit Paris climate goals 10 years early and go carbon neutral by 2040\n\nAmazon stock is up 18.3% for the year to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.00% has gained 21.2% this year.", "description": "Amazon.com Inc. announced Tuesday that it is eliminating the $14.99-per-month fee for grocery delivery, making delivery from Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods...", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GG902_amazon_ZG_20180406092854.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
