Sales are 3.9 percent higher than September 2018.\n\n\u201cWe must continue to beat the drum for more inventory,\u201d NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHome prices are rising too rapidly because of the housing shortage, and this lack of inventory is preventing home sales growth potential.\u201d\n\nTotal housing inventory at the end of September sat at 1.83 million, about the same as for August, but 2.7 percent below September 2018, the report said.\n\nNAR said all four major regions of the country saw home sales decline, with the Midwest taking the biggest hit, falling 3.1 percent, while the West did best with a decline of just 0.9 percent.\n\nDespite the decline in sales \u2014 concentrated in single family homes \u2014 Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics pointed to other data showing mortgage applications continue to rise.\n\n\u201cThe trend is rising, despite the September dip,\u201d he said in an analysis of the data. \u201cBy the end of the winter, though, we expect the upturn to run out of steam as payroll growth slows, layoffs rise and consumers\u2019 confidence fades.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 The short supply of housing in the United States pushed prices up sharply in September, causing sales of existing homes to drop,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/fdb2a2_national-association-realtors-continue-beat-drum-housing-as-shortage-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
