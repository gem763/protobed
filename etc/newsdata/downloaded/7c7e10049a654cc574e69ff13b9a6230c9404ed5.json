(James Lawler Duggan/Reuters)\n\nThe organization has ousted its president, apparently for being insufficiently committed to pro-abortion advocacy.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s board has fired the organization\u2019s president, Leana Wen, after less than a year on the job. According to reports, Wen was dismissed because the board deemed her insufficiently dedicated to expanding Planned Parenthood\u2019s political advocacy, particularly on abortion.\n\nThe news comes as a shock for a few reasons. For one thing, Wen was appointed just last fall to replace Cecile Richards, who resigned on good terms after leading the institution for twelve years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s surprising, too, if Wen\u2019s ouster was due to her reluctance to focus more on politics than on public health, as several reports suggest was the case. In June, after all, Planned Parenthood announced a six-figure ad campaign, \u201cBans Off My Body,\u201d to oppose recent state laws regulating abortion. Judging from Wen\u2019s Twitter account, she was perfectly comfortable promoting what the group frequently calls \u201creproductive rights.\u201d\n\nWhy, then, was she forced to depart so unceremoniously, and what does her abrupt exit say about the future of Planned Parenthood?\n\nWen\u2019s dismissal is perhaps best understood in light of the escalating national fight over abortion policy. As blue states have codified the right to abortion on demand, in many cases deeming it a \u201cfundamental right,\u201d red states have passed limitations like heartbeat bills to protect unborn human beings earlier in pregnancy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlanned Parenthood has long sought to downplay its commitment to abortion, calling itself a health-care organization and spreading the lie that abortion is only 3 percent of its business, even as its clinics perform between one-third and half of all abortions in the U.S. annually. The group\u2019s leadership evidently believes this political moment demands more aggressive advocacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Wen wasn\u2019t up to the task. Considering her record thus far, she was hired for the \u201cM.D.\u201d beside her name, and little else. She came across in interviews like a placid physician repeating rote talking points drilled into her on the drive to the studio. She consistently inserted the phrase \u201cas a doctor\u201d into her messaging to give the organization the gloss of medical legitimacy, and she never sounded like the polished, sure-footed political advocate Richards had.\n\nPlenty of turmoil, meanwhile, was taking place behind the scenes. \u201cWen had tried to refocus the organization\u2019s mission and image as a health provider offering a wide array of services, including abortions,\u201d sources told the Washington Post this week. \u201cThose close to Wen said she was opposed by some board members and others who wanted to emphasize the organization\u2019s commitment to abortion rights.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn January, Wen told BuzzFeed News she wanted to restructure the organization\u2019s goals, noting that people aren\u2019t going to Planned Parenthood to make a political statement. \u201cWhat we will always be here to do is provide abortion access as part of the full spectrum of reproductive health care,\u201d Wen said. \u201cBut we also recognize that for so many of our patients we are their only source of health care.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe day BuzzFeed published its profile, though, Wen backtracked. \u201cI am always happy to do interviews, but these headlines completely misconstrue my vision for Planned Parenthood,\u201d Wen tweeted that morning. \u201cOur core mission is providing, protecting and expanding access to abortion and reproductive health care. We will never back down from that fight.\u201d\n\nWen\u2019s termination sheds some light on this quick reversal. It\u2019s easy to imagine that she faced internal backlash for appearing to have shied away from abortion advocacy, and that her public about-face was an effort to pacify critics within the organization.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work. In February, top political staffers left Planned Parenthood, reportedly amid ongoing conflict over Wen\u2019s management style. Now that tension seems to have boiled over. Six sources told BuzzFeed this week that \u201csignificant management issues [were] part of the board\u2019s decision to oust Wen,\u201d and one \u201csaid her removal was accelerated by the intensifying battle over abortion rights, saying that she was not the right leader in this climate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps the most revealing detail from Buzzfeed\u2019s report? Two sources said Wen angered staffers by refusing to use \u201ctrans-inclusive\u201d language, \u201cfor example saying \u2018people\u2019 instead of \u2018women\u2019 and telling staff that she believed talking about transgender issues would \u2018isolate people in the Midwest.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis anecdote might well be the key to understanding what happened to Wen and where Planned Parenthood\u2019s leaders intend to go from here. Surely she wasn\u2019t fired for her recalcitrance on preferred pronouns. But with a national spotlight on the abortion debate, Planned Parenthood\u2019s leaders are ready to take off the kid gloves.\n\nWen\u2019s firing suggests that, instead of claiming to be just a normal health-care organization, Planned Parenthood intends to capitalize on its status as an influential left-wing interest group. To do that, it must become a purveyor of the entire progressive agenda, to the point of embracing the \u201cintersectional\u201d language promoted by transgender activists. So the mild-mannered Wen had to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPro-lifers have long known what Planned Parenthood itself appears to be admitting: The group\u2019s ultimate goal is to wield its political influence within the progressive movement to continue profiting from abortion.", "description": "Wen\u2019s firing suggests that, instead of claiming to be just a normal health-care group, Planned Parenthood intends to capitalize on its status as an influential left-wing interest group.
