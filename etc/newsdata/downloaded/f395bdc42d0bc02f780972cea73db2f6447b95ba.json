But after those financial ties became public following Epstein\u2019s death by suicide Aug. 10, Ito apologized, saying in a statement Aug 15 that he was \u201cdeeply sorry,\u201d and that \u201cin all of my interactions with Epstein, I was never involved in, never heard him talk about, and never saw any evidence of the horrific acts that he was accused of.\u201d\n\nHowever, Farrow reports that Ito was aware not only of the accusations of sexual misconduct, but that Epstein had been formally disqualified as a donor by the university due to his 2008 sex-trafficking conviction.\n\nAlso Read: Jeffrey Epstein Tried Intimidating Vanity Fair's Graydon Carter With a Bullet and Severed Cat Head (Report)\n\nAccording to Farrow, Ito took active measures to ensure his colleagues at the university would not find out about the relationship with Epstein. They included instructing subordinates to list Epstein\u2019s donations as anonymous, according to emails printed in the New Yorker.\n\nIto allowed Epstein to visit the lab, and he and his subordinates made certain his name was never included on any calendar, according to a former lab employee, Signe Swenson, who spoke to Farrow. Swenson told Farrow she expressed concerns about the relationship with Epstein on more than one occasion and eventually quit over it.\n\nFarrow also reports that Ito credited Epstein with facilitating several million dollars in donations from high-profile donors including Bill Gates. In a statement provided to the New Yorker, a representative for Gates denied any connection between Epstein and Gates\u2019 donations to the Media Lab.\n\nAlso Read: Two Women Sue Jeffrey Epstein's Estate, Employees for $100 Million\n\nIto did not immediately respond to a request for comment from TheWrap.

Zuckerman, a media scholar and internet activist, cited the group\u2019s work on social justice and \u201con the inclusion of marginalized individuals\u201d for his decision. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to do that work with a straight face in a place that violated its own values so clearly in working with Epstein and in disguising that relationship,\u201d he wrote in a Medium post.\n\nZuckerman also said he had learned the research group\u2019s ties to Epstein \u201cwent much deeper\u201d than had been disclosed previously.\n\nRead original story MIT Media Lab Covered Up Extent of Ties to Jeffrey Epstein (Report) At TheWrap", "description": "Staff members of the MIT Media Lab, including director Joi Ito, actively sought to conceal the lab\u2019s relationship with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, according to a new report by Ronan Farrow published in the New Yorker on Friday.Epstein became a frequent donor to the lab after meeting Ito in 2013", "authors": ["Ross A.
