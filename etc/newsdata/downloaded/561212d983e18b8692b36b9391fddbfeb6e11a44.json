REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nThailand wants Chevron to pay the full decommissioning costs for infrastructure at the Erawan gas field, which it is due to hand over to Thai state oil firm PTT Exploration and Production Pcl in April 2022 when its concessions expire.\n\nThose costs have been estimated by one local newspaper at up to $2.5 billion.\n\nThe dispute has implications for other international energy companies such as France\u2019s Total SA and Japan\u2019s Mitsui & Co, which also have stakes in offshore energy concessions in the Gulf of Thailand.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed to temporarily suspend the arbitration process to allow more time for resolution discussions,\u201d a Chevron spokesman told Reuters.\n\nHe said the company had been \u201cencouraged\u201d by the Thai energy minister\u2019s efforts to come to an agreement, but added that arbitration was still a possibility \u201cwithin weeks\u201d if talks do not succeed.\n\nA spokesman for Thailand\u2019s energy ministry on Wednesday said he could not comment on the talks with Chevron.\n\nMinister of Energy Sontirat Sontijirawong said in July he wanted to resolve the dispute as a matter of urgency to avoid an arbitration process, but that the issue was complicated.\n\nThe dispute arose in 2016 when Thailand retroactively enforced a new energy ministry regulation requiring gas field operators to pay the costs of decommissioning all assets they have installed even if they no longer operate those assets.\n\nChevron argues that under the terms of its initial contracts from 1971, it is only liable for infrastructure that is no longer deemed usable before it hands over the field to another operator.\n\nThe new law would require Chevron to pay the future costs of decommissioning all the infrastructure it has installed at the Erawan field, including still usable assets it will transfer to PTTEP free of charge.\n\nChevron told Reuters in July that moving to an arbitration process provided for by the 1971 contracts was a possibility.\n\nThe company had objected to a June request by Thailand\u2019s energy ministry to pay the full decommissioning cost of all its assets in the Erawan field upfront.\n\nNeither Chevron nor the ministry would disclose the amount of the requested payment when asked by Reuters. However, local newspaper Thansettakij has reported it as around 75 billion baht ($2.5 billion), citing industry sources.\n\nRETROACTIVE LAW\n\nOther operators in Thailand are watching the dispute closely in case it changes their future liabilities for assets in Thailand.\n\n\u201cTotal will particularly be tracking the developments between Chevron and the government... since it will set a precedent that the government could apply to it,\u201d said Readul Islam, research analyst at Rystad Energy.\n\nChevron won the concessions to operate four blocks constituting the Erawan gas field, Thailand\u2019s second largest, from 1972 to 2012, after which the contracts were extended for 10 more years.\n\nChevron lost out to PTTEP, a unit of the state-owned PTT Pcl, in a bidding round for the new concession in December.\n\nForeign investors in Thailand in other industries were also concerned about what precedent the case might set for the sanctity of their contracts.\n\n\u201cIt will snowball, as it\u2019s not just Chevron,\u201d said Kornkasiwat Kasemsri, director of the Energy and Resources Policy Research Center at Thailand\u2019s Rangsit University.\n\n\u201cWhat decision is made in this case could affect other cases to follow.\u201d", "description": "U.S. energy major Chevron Corp has opted to continue negotiations with Thailand rather than seek arbitration to resolve a dispute over who should pay for removing offshore oil and gas platforms, the company told Reuters on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Patpicha Tanakasempipat", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434373101&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0V4", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
