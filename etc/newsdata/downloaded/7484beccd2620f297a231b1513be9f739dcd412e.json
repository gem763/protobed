He let him be himself. That is one thing Joe does really well: there are certain times when guys have to fall in certain lanes as coaches.\u201d\n\nBut early on, according to Camp, Martinez was able to experiment.\n\nCamp went to Robinson High in Fairfax and is a former pitcher at George Mason University, where he is now the pitching coach. He is not surprised that the Nationals\u2019 clubhouse is laid-back and reflects the mode of their manager.\n\n\u201cHe is a player\u2019s guy. He is fun to be around. I think you see that in the clubhouse,\u201d Camp said of Martinez.\n\nCamp is happy for veteran players who are in the World Series for the first time, such as Ryan Zimmerman and Howie Kendrick. \u201cIt is an exciting time for this city,\u201d Camp said. Kendrick was playing for the Angels in 2006 when he hit his first career homer off Camp and the Rays.\n\nMaddon was just named the manager of the Angels after being with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
