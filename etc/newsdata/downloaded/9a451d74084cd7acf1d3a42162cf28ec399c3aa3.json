Far too often their stories have died with them.\n\n\n\nNot only are there no precise figures(official government estimates on homeless deaths in England and Wales were published for the first time last year, but the real numbers could be higher), but in many cases their deaths were not properly investigated, so we may never know who these people were and what happened to them.\n\n\n\nA new series by G2 and Guardian Cities tells the stories of homeless people in cities around the UK who have died, piecing together details about their lives to commemorate them and to try to answer crucial unanswered questions: why did they die? Could their deaths have been prevented?\n\n\n\nHowever, we know that far more homeless people have died without proper recognition than we can report on. So, we want tohear your stories: are there people you know, or people in your community, who have died while homeless? Who would you like to share your memories of and pay tribute to?\n\nShare your tributes\n\nYou can share your memories in the form below, anonymously if you\u2019d prefer, and we will aim tofeature them in the following weeks. We understand this is a very sensitive issue and we will not publish any stories without one of our journalists speaking to you first.\n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble using the form, click here.
