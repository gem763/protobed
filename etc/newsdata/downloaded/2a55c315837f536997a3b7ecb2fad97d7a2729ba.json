It exploited the site\u2019s Register API used for sign-ups.\n\nA video posted by Ahmed shows a hacker can use a person\u2019s phone number as user name and gain access to the account through the flaw. The bug allowed hackers to even change account details for JD Pay so all the money sent to that account gets redirected. However, it didn\u2019t allow them to send money as it requires an additional PIN.\n\nJustDial said in a statement the flaw was fixed yesterday:\n\nWe at Justdial take security seriously. There was a bug in one of our APIs which could potentially be accessed by an expert hacker. This bug has been fixed. We work with various security researchers to strengthen our platform and would like to thank Ehraz Ahmed for bringing this out to us.\n\nThe company said there was no loss of data.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FJustDial.jpg&signature=671b18ee153a44bd7ad3439a81cf7cb5", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
