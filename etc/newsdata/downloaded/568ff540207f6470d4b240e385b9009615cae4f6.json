If you were born 18 years ago, you are today a young adult, old enough to find a job, begin college, enlist in the military and vote for the first time. You also should know what happened in 2001, the year you were born. But, given the state of America\u2019s educational system, I\u2019m not confident you do. So let me briefly fill you in.\n\nBack then, the Soviet socialist experiment had collapsed, ending the Cold War which had followed World War II which had followed a decade of economic depression which came 11 years after the end of World War I.\n\nThat led to the belief \u2014 naive but widely held \u2014 that there was a \u201cnew normal,\u201d that Americans could cash a \u201cpeace dividend,\u201d that whatever differences remained among the world\u2019s peoples could now be resolved through diplomacy, commercial relations and the intercession of transnational bureaucrats.\n\nThen, on September 11, 2001, a sparkling late summer morning, enemies of America hijacked four passenger jets and turned them into guided missiles.\n\nTwo planes brought down the World Trade Center, symbol of America\u2019s economic might. One struck the Pentagon, headquarters of America\u2019s military strength. A fourth was headed for the White House, where America\u2019s top elected leader resides. That fourth jet failed to reach its target thanks to the heroic resistance of the passengers onboard.\n\nNearly 3,000 people, ranging in age from 2 to 85, were killed, a higher death toll than Pearl Harbor in 1941. Al Qaeda, the organization responsible, spent about a half-million dollars to plan and execute the attacks. The cost to the United States has been estimated at more than $3 trillion.\n\nPresident George W. Bush soon launched a Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). The flaw in that concept: Terrorism is not the enemy. Terrorism is a weapon wielded by the enemy.\n\nA more accurate description of the enemy was provided by Bernard Lewis, the late, great scholar of the Middle East: \u201ca movement in the Islamic world.\u201d\n\nTo elaborate: Our enemies are Islamic supremacists fighting a long war against the West, against Judeo-Christian civilization, against \u201cCrusaders and Zionists.\u201d\n\nOr as Ruhollah Khomeini said years before he would become supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran: \u201cThose who study jihad will understand why Islam wants to conquer the whole world. All the countries conquered by Islam or to be conquered in the future will be marked for everlasting salvation. For they shall live under Allah\u2019s law.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama jettisoned President Bush\u2019s GWOT, replacing it with CVE, Countering Violent Extremism. Just last week, the Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal think tank led by Michael Waldman, a former assistant to President Clinton, published an article: \u201cWhy Countering Violent Extremism Programs Are Bad Policy.\u201d Its contention: \u201cNo evidence demonstrates that they are effective in reducing terrorist violence or even the spread of \u2018extreme\u2019 ideas.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s policies vis-a-vis jihadism can best be described as a mixed bag. Thanks to his renewal of economic sanctions, Iran\u2019s rulers have fewer resources to devote to terrorism and imperialist aggression. Nevertheless, there has not been a sophisticated, orchestrated, mass-casualty Islamist terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11, thanks to an aggressive counter-terrorism policy. Would anyone have expected that to be the case 18 years ago?\n\nAlso, and despite his misgivings, Mr. Trump has maintained a small contingent of American troops in Syria whose main mission is to enable Kurdish and Arab partners to continue to diminish the Islamic State, which emerged following Mr. Obama\u2019s withdrawal from Iraq in 2011.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger: Zalmay Khalilzad, who carries the rosy title of Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, has been negotiating with the Taliban, the Islamists who ruled Afghanistan in 2001, giving safe harbor to al Qaeda and, after the attacks of 9/11, refusing to surrender Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe Taliban have continued their terrorist attacks even as the talks have proceeded. Last Thursday, a car bombing near the U.S. embassy in Kabul killed an American paratrooper, a NATO soldier from Romania and at least 10 civilians. Ambassador Khalilzad resumed negotiations the very next day.\n\nThen, over the weekend, Mr. Trump revealed that he had planned to meet with Taliban leaders at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, just 48 hours before the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nCan you think of a better way to send a message of legitimacy and encouragement not just to the Taliban but to all jihadi groups and regimes in the Middle East and beyond?\n\nBetter late than never, the thought occurred to Mr. Trump: If the Taliban \u201ccannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway.\u201d He went on to cancel the meeting and suspend further negotiations.\n\nRegarding the Taliban, he tweeted: \u201cHow many more decades are they willing to fight?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll venture a guess: As many as it takes. Afghanistan is but one battle in a war that has been waged, on and off, for centuries. The empires, caliphates, emirates, regimes and groups doing the killing change. The goals do not. As one Taliban captive famously said: \u201cYou have the watches. We have the time.\u201d\n\nIf President Trump, unlike his predecessor, believes that no deal is better than a bad deal, he will want to have a tough talk with Ambassador Khalilzad about the necessary contours of a good deal with the Taliban.\n\nOne American administration after another has fought this conflict erratically and without a coherent global strategy to defeat or at least contain the jihadis \u2014 to frustrate their ambitions. If you\u2019re 18, and you understand that, you must be sorely disappointed by how much your elders have not achieved since the fateful year you were born.\n\n\u2022 Clifford D.
