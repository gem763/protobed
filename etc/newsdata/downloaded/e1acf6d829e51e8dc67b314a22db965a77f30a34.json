Peacefully,\" his son-in-law told Agence France-Presse on Thursday.\n\nIn one of France's longest political careers, Chirac held the country's most powerful office for 12 years, from 1995 to 2007, and served as prime minister twice. He also was a member of the country's parliament, the mayor of Paris and founded the conservative party now known as Les R\u00e9publicains.\n\nIt was during Chirac's presidency that France refused to join the U.S. in the Iraq war in 2003 and French citizens rejected the treaty establishing a constitution for the EU in a 2005 referendum.\n\n\u201cWar is always a last resort. It is always proof of failure. It is always the worst of solutions, because it brings death and misery,\u201d he said a week before the U.S.-led coalition forces invaded Iraq.\n\nIn 2011, the former president was given a two-year suspended prison sentence for embezzling public funds. In his final years, he was suffering from a neurological illness and was rarely seen in public.\n\nThe French National Assembly observed a minute's silence in his memory.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron is expected to speak on television Thursday evening to pay tribute to his late predecessor.\n\nAnother former French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, paid homage to Chirac by saying \"I know that today, the French people, whatever their convictions, have just lost a friend.\"\n\nJean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, also paid tribute, saying Europe had lost \"a great statesman\" and he had lost \"a great friend.\"\n\nFormer U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair said in a statement: \u201cI am deeply saddened by the passing of Jacques Chirac. He was a towering figure in French and European politics over many decades. Whatever our differences from time to time, he was always unfailingly kind, generous and personally supportive.\"\n\nBlair added: \u201cI always respected his forthright expression of views and I always felt his deep love and passion for France and the French people.\u201d\n\nBelgian MEP and former Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt said: \"When we discussed tough issues, his humor always brought a sense of relief. But it is especially his attachment to the European project that turned him into the real statesman that we will miss.\"", "description": "Chirac served as president, prime minister and Paris mayor in one of France\u2019s longest political careers.", "authors": ["Laura Kayali"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-145869660-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
