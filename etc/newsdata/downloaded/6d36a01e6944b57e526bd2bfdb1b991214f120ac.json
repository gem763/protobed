Putin is likely to seek commitments from Erdo\u011fan on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for us is achieving long-term stability in Syria and the region,\u201d President Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said ahead of the talks on Tuesday. \u201cWe believe this can only be achieved by restoring the unity of Syria.\u201d\n\nDespite the ceasefire, intermittent fighting between the SDF and Ankara\u2019s Syrian rebel proxies has continued.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Turkish forces in the northern Syrian town of Tel Abyad. Photograph: Xinhua/Barcroft Media\n\nKino Gabriel, the SDF spokesman, confirmed over the weekend that all its fighters had evacuated the town of Ras al-Ayn, one of the two border towns bearing the brunt of the Turkish attack, as part of the US-brokered pause.\n\nRedur Khalil, a senior SDF official, also said that following the evacuation of the remaining civilians and fighters from Ras al-Ayn, his fighters would pull back from the strip of land between the town and Tel Abyad, which is also under Turkish attack.\n\nAnkara has stuck to its original proposal of a 270-mile long (440km), 20-mile deep buffer zone, but the SDF has only acknowledged the 75-mile area between Ras al-Ayn and Tel Abyad.\n\nThe US-brokered agreement struck last Thursday did not specify the zone\u2019s size. Previous agreements between Washington and Ankara over a \u201csafe zone\u201d along the Syria-Turkish border have floundered over diverging definitions of the area.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to withdraw from Syria, which effectively green-lighted the Turkish attack, has been widely condemned as a betrayal of the US\u2019s military partner in the five-year-long campaign to defeat Islamic State.\n\nAnkara, however, has long maintained that the main Kurdish unit within the SDF is indistinguishable from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which has waged war against the Turkish state for decades.", "description": "Turkish leader says he will act \u2018even more strongly\u2019 as end of US-brokered ceasefire looms", "authors": ["Bethan Mckernan", "Nesrine Malik"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b3c3fc9170d8893cbe46b662f8f3855b69ddc09/0_118_4088_2453/master/4088.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4a3ac174fffca07318ee6aade0dc46c8", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
