USA TODAY\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens have taken a step to shore up their secondary.\n\nThe team has traded for former Los Angeles Rams cornerback Marcus Peters, in exchange for linebacker Kenny Young and an undisclosed 2020 NFL draft pick. FOX Sports was the first to report the news of the deal.\n\nThe Ravens rank 25th in the NFL in passing defense, allowing 269.5 yards a game. Peters, 26, will be headed to his third team after stints with the Kansas City Chiefs and the Rams. Peters is in his fifth season in the league and has 14 tackles, four passes defended, two interceptions, and one touchdown this season. He was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2015 and '16 and boasts 24 career interceptions, the most of any player since 2014.\n\nBaltimore is currently 4-2, sitting atop the AFC North standings with a two-game lead.\n\nIt\u2019s a curious move for the Rams, who trade away a starting cornerback after they had to place Aqib Talib on injured reserve as he deals with fractured ribs.\n\nNFL power rankings: Texans rocket into top five, while Cowboys tumble from top half\n\nMore: Packers' David Bakhtiari made umpire aware of potential penalties before they were called\n\nYoung is a 24-year-old inside linebacker who had started three games this year and has totaled 13 tackles and one forced fumble. He was a healthy scratch two weeks ago, though, and played just six snaps on special teams in Sunday's win against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nThe Rams, meanwhile, are 3-3 after dropping their last three games and needed an injection of athleticism on defense, especially at linebacker.\n\nLos Angeles also acquired offensive lineman Austin Corbett from the Cleveland Browns in a separate trade on Tuesday. Corbett, the No. 33 overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft, could be asked to step up for a unit that lost offensive guard Joseph Noteboom to torn anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in Sunday's loss to the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
