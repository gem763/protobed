The coalition has not yet responded to the proposal.\n\nThe ICRC said two detainees were transferred to their areas of origin by Yemeni Red Crescent ambulances.", "description": "Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group on Monday released hundreds of Yemeni prisoners in a unilateral move welcomed by the United Nations envoy, who hoped it would lead to further progress on an agreed prisoner exchange deal.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
