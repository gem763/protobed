(Jim Havard via Flickr)\n\nA gloomy Saturday with high temperatures near 80 gives way to scattered showers and storms this evening. Nothing severe is expected, although pockets of brief heavy rain, frequent lightning and some stronger wind gusts could be seen in parts of the area. Sunday will be much brighter and a little warmer, with a noticeable drop in humidity.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: Showers and storms are already approaching Interstate 81 out ahead of a cold front, and they will continue to march east as the afternoon gives way to early evening. It\u2019s at this time that the D.C. metro area may see the showers and storms move in, bringing brief periods of heavy rain, frequent lightning and even a few strong wind gusts. These storms should pull away by late evening, leaving behind mostly cloudy skies and patchy fog. Temperatures look to bottom out in the mid-60s to near 70, while winds blow from the south at 5-10 mph.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Sunday): Any fog in the area should lift by midmorning and clouds will decrease to the point where skies are mostly sunny by late morning. With more sunshine, highs will be warmer as they hit the mid-80s. However, humidity should be noticeably lower (and therefore the air will feel a bit more comfortable) with dew points settling into the low 60s.\n\nSee Ian Livingston\u2019s forecast through the weekend.

A Canadian-based high pressure system will nose into the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday and remain in place overhead through at least Saturday. For the balance of this week, highs should be near the average of 79 for this time of year, and no rainfall is forecast. What\u2019s more, humidity will stay in check as dew points likely stay around or below 60.\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
