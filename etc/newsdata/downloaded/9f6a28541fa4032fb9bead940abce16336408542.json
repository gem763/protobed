I think it would be a mistake to attack his credibility,\u201d South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said in an interview. \u201cYou can obviously take issue with the substance and there are different interpretations about all that stuff. But I wouldn\u2019t go after him personally. He\u2019s a patriot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to question the patriotism of any of the people who come forward,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), though he declined to comment \"on the merit of what\u2019s going forward\" or Vindman's suggestion that he was concerned Trump's actions had undermined national security.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of the most hawkish Republicans in the House and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said it would be \u201cshameful\u201d to question Vindman\u2019s loyalty or patriotism to the country.\n\nCheney wasn\u2019t even pressed by reporters on the topic; in her opening remarks during a weekly leadership news conference in the Capitol, she went out of her way to decry the attacks on Vindman, including the outlandish theory that he was a potential spy working against the United States.\n\n\u201cWe need to show that we are better than that as a nation,\u201d said Cheney, the third-ranking House Republican. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation, who put their lives on the line. And it is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this nation, and we should not be involved in this process.\u201d\n\n\"This is the career military officer with a Purple Heart? I'm sure he's doing his best to serve his country,\" said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, the No. 4 GOP leader. \"Somebody can have a wrong sense of where they think the path goes but that doesn't mean that they're wrongly motivated. ... Criticizing this guy? No. I wouldn't be on board.\"\n\nFormer Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) said on CNN that Vindman seems \u201cincredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense. I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s concerned about American policy,\u201d adding that Vindman\u2019s \u201caffinity\u201d may be for Ukraine not the United States.\n\nTrump also attacked Vindman as a \"Never Trumper witness\" on Tuesday.\n\nBut it appeared the criticism from Duffy's former colleagues was having an effect. Duffy tweeted later Tuesday that Vindman is an \"American war hero,\" and that the point he was trying to make is that \"Mr. Vindman is an unelected advisor, he gives ADVICE. President Trump sets the policy.\"", "description": "", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio", "Kyle Cheney", "-", "Sen.
