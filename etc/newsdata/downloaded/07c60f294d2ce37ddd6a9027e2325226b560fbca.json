You have a maximum of \u00a31,200 to spend, but you want to make a few savings.\n\nYou could set a hard budget of \u00a31,000 and hope to save the whole \u00a3200. People who do this might be successful, but if for any reason you exceed your budget, you are likely to trigger the \u201cWhat the hell\u201d effect and spend much more of your \u00a31,200. And if you set your budget at \u00a31,200, most people end up spending the full amount \u2013 making no savings.\n\nIf, however, you set yourself a budget of \u00a31,000 but treat the remaining \u00a3200 as an \u201cemergency reserve\u201d, those people who, for whatever reason, need to go slightly over their budget end up spending less than either of the two other groups.\n\nMentally storing that money to use in emergencies creates a feeling of guilt around using it. By giving yourself a little bit of wiggle-room when setting out your goal, you get all the benefits of a challenging target to aim for, but tapping into those extra funds does not trigger the \u201cWhat the hell\u201d effect that causes you to spiral out of control.\n\nA key factor when setting your emergency reserve limit is that there is enough guilt in using it up. \u201cThere has to be a psychological cost to using it,\u201d says Sharif. \u201cOur intuition tells us not to use up our emergency reserves because we might have a greater need for them later. A lot of the time you don\u2019t end up using them at all. People are resistant to use them unless they really have to.\u201d", "description": "By cutting yourself some slack, you can future-proof yourself against annoying setbacks.
