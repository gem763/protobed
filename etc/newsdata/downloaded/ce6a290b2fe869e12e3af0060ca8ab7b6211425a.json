But the YPG has been a main U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, infuriating Turkey and straining ties with Washington.\n\nAs a way to address Turkish concerns, the United States has started carrying out the joint patrols with Ankara, with the first land patrol on Sunday and the fourth joint overflight of the area on Thursday.\n\nBut, at least so far, the joint patrols appear to have failed to satisfy demands from Ankara, which wants the operations to expand rapidly as far as 20 miles (32 km) from its border to create a safe zone controlled by Turkish troops.\n\nOn Tuesday, Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu accused Washington of stalling and taking only \u201ccosmetic steps.\u201d\n\nTurkey and the United States have been at loggerheads over a host of issues in recent months, including Ankara\u2019s acquisition of Russian air defence systems. That led the Pentagon to kick the NATO ally out of a major U.S. fighter jet program.\n\nTurkey has relied heavily on President Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s personal ties with Trump to manage tensions. Erdogan and Trump are due to meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly later this month to discuss developments in Syria, trade and other bilateral issues.", "description": "The U.S. military will not increase troop levels in Syria to carry out joint patrols with Turkish forces, a top general said on Friday, adding that his goal was to eventually reduce the number of U.S. forces in the country.", "authors": ["Phil Stewart", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
