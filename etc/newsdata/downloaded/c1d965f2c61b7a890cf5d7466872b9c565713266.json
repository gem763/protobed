Ziegler, the founder and former CEO of the money management firm Artisan Partners, and his wife, Carlene M. Ziegler.\n\nThe house was built in 2000 and was listed by Gordon Hillock of Kiawah Island Real Estate on May 24.\n\nMr. Hillock said the Zieglers, who extensively remodeled the house, are downsizing.\n\n\"They are horse people, and they are relocating to Florida and building their main house there,\" he said. Once this property is sold, they plan to buy a smaller one on Kiawah Island, he said.\n\n\"The property has a sense of privacy and serenity that you seldom get elsewhere,\" Mr. Hillock said. \"It connects directly to the private beach, and it\u2019s next door to the beach club, which is probably the most popular part of the Kiawah Island Club. It\u2019s a great family home for all generations.\"\n\nMore: A Recently Renovated Home on an Oceanfront Estate on Kiawah Island With Walls of Windows\n\nStats\n\nThe 8,034-square-foot house, set on more than one acre, has three levels, six bedrooms, seven bathrooms and two half-bathrooms. The property also has a guest house and a separate full-size landscaped building site that can either be used to expand the existing estate or sold separately by the new owners.\n\nAmenities\n\nThe estate features a garden and landscaped pond, an outdoor terrace with a music system and a saline pool and spa and dehumidified garages that can house up to seven cars and seven beach cruiser bicycles. Inside the house, there are high-tech music and lighting systems, an elevator, three kitchen/prep areas, a fireplace and a dining room with a porch outfitted with outside speakers. The games room, library and family room are appointed with stained antique pecan architectural detailing designed by an Oklahoma artisan.
