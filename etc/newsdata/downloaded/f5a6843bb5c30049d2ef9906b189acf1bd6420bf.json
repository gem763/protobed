Just before he went inside, he told reporters from the Argentinian magazine El Gr\u00e1fico what he planned to say. \u201cI think we have a 20% chance of success, but it will get much harder if we lose our heads,\u201d he said. \u201cThe important thing is to keep calm, play well, try to win the game even if we cannot recover the aggregate deficit, give a good account of ourselves and don\u2019t get anyone sent off. Play well, go out to win, but without losing control.\u201d\n\nThe forgotten story of \u2026 the referee smuggled from irate fans in disguise Read more\n\nCramped inside the hotel room his team listened intently. They mulled it over. And then they went to the stadium and played with such violence that three of them ended up in prison.\n\nNot that Zubeld\u00eda can plausibly claim innocence. This was a coach whose teams were always prone to violence and acts of premeditated dastardliness. The midfielder Juan Ram\u00f3n Ver\u00f3n (one of two fathers of future Chelsea players involved in the game, along with the Milan goalkeeper Fabio Cudicini) said the Estudiantes side would be briefed on their rivals\u2019 \u201chabits, their characters, their weaknesses, and even their private lives\u201d so they were best able to goad them into getting themselves sent off. Like many particularly successful teams \u2013 think tiki-taka, or the catenaccio pioneered by Milan\u2019s Nereo Rocco \u2013 their tactics ended up with their own name: El anti-f\u00fatbol. With it they reached four successive Copa Libertadores finals, winning three, and beat Manchester United in the 1968 Intercontinental Cup (\u201cthe dirtiest team I\u2019ve played against,\u201d said Paddy Crerand).\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t win the Intercontinental Cup playing anti-f\u00fatbol,\u201d Zubeld\u00eda insisted. \u201cWhat happened with Estudientes after 1968 was that we got tired and the players ran out of stamina. There were so many tours and friendlies, the entire squad was injured. That\u2019s why the players, because they did not have the physical strength to play, turned to dirty tricks instead. What they called anti-f\u00fatbol was not a strategy, it was necessity.\u201d\n\nWell, perhaps. On that night in October 1969 the atmosphere inside the Bombonera was so febrile that Milan cut short their warm-up because of the level of abuse they were receiving. And then the game, and the violence, started. In the first half Pierino Prati, the Milan striker, was kicked to the ground by Alberto Jos\u00e9 Poletti, the Estudiantes goalkeeper \u2013 on the halfway line, while the home side took a corner \u2013 and then headbutted out of the game by Ramon Su\u00e1rez.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police speak to an Estudiantes player.

Estudiantes came back to lead 2-1 on the night, before shortly after half-time Su\u00e1rez made another telling intervention. \u201cHaving insulted N\u00e9stor Combin horribly and covered him in spit, and while play continued far away, Su\u00e1rez savagely hit his opponent on the nose,\u201d wrote La Stampa. Combin crumpled to the turf, blood pouring from his face, and was loaded on to a stretcher. It turned out this was not to be the low point of his evening.\n\nAfter more savage fouling but no further scoring the game ended and the players returned to their dressing rooms, some throwing a few more punches along the way. Face swollen and balls of cotton wool stuffed up each nostril to stem the bleeding, Combin eventually emerged at 12.30am to board the team coach, but as he made his way across the car park he was surrounded by six unfamiliar people and bundled into an unmarked green car. A fan leapt upon the bonnet to stop it leaving, and was hauled off by police and beaten. Milan thought their night of controversy and confusion was coming to a close; in fact it had only just begun.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Milan\u2019s Nestor Combin suffered facial injuries after being assaulted by an Estudiantes player. Photograph: Topham Picturepoint/Press Association Images\n\nCombin had been born in Argentina, and in the local media was portrayed as a traitor in the buildup to the game, particularly as he had not done his national service. A magistrate in his home province of Santa Fe had accused him of draft-dodging in 1963, and there had been much speculation that he might be arrested and charged with desertion, a genuine enough concern that many other Argentina-born footballers of the era refused to return to their homeland. Combin, however, had served in the French army and under the terms of a reciprocal agreement between the two nations had no obligations to the land of his birth. This did not dissuade the Buenos Aires police from basically kidnapping him.\n\nIn the early hours of Thursday morning Italian journalists toured the city\u2019s police stations in search of the lost player. At 2am he was finally located, but 45 minutes later he was bundled into another car and driven away again, this time to a military prison. At 3.30am Milan officials finally returned to their hotel, where one of them \u2013 who had been hit on the head by a baton-wielding policeman at the ground earlier in the evening \u2013 collapsed. At 4am Combin was officially charged with draft-dodging, and Milan officials set about assembling evidence to exculpate him \u2013 the player had taken the precaution of packing his draft book and a letter from the French consular general in Milan. At 10.30am a tired and groggy Combin was allowed to briefly talk to journalists (\u201cSu\u00e1rez kept yelling, \u2018I\u2019ll break your leg\u2019 and spitting in my face. I truly have no idea why he had it in for me\u201d). At noon, after the intervention of the Argentinian president, Juan Carlos Ongan\u00eda, he was released and driven to the airport to join his teammates on the flight home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Milan players help an injured teammate off the pitch at the Bombonera.

At his request police issued arrest warrants for Poletti, Su\u00e1rez and Manera, who turned themselves in that afternoon. All three received 30-day jail sentences and lengthy bans.\n\nThe match sealed Argentina\u2019s reputation for dastardliness, to which the 1966 World Cup quarter-final against England and Estudiantes\u2019 two games against United had already contributed. But in truth such violence was a global disease. Brazil\u2019s head coach, Jo\u00e3o Saldanha, had gone to the first leg in Milan while on a lengthy scouting trip to Europe, where he saw plenty of similar savagery. \u201cKarate is a good sport. I used to do karate and I like it. But it should not be practiced in football boots,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIn the matches Romania v Portugal and Yugoslavia v Belgium the kicking started at the navel and got higher and higher \u2026 Why play when it is no longer a football match, when the laws have been thrown into the rubbish bin and we have the law of the jungle instead?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Milan players, including Combin, with a swollen face, display the trophy after returning from Argentina.

Some 18 months after the Milan game another Argentinian side, Boca Juniors, played Peru\u2019s Sporting Cristal in the Copa Libertadores. Two minutes from the end a fight broke out that led to a fractured skull, a broken nose, one player beating another with a corner flag, the mother of one of the Peruvians dying of a heart attack as she watched her son getting pummelled on television, 19 red cards and perhaps a feeling back in Milan that, all things considered, maybe they actually got off rather lightly.\n\n", "description": "Intercontinental Cup tie in Argentina was marked by bloody violence but one Milan\u2019s player ordeal had only just begun", "authors": ["Simon Burnton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd71cef422e6cb8b0bcc4e55815fac56e20c6520/18_395_4468_2681/master/4468.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ed95b4c41cec56441715e6cd24d66dee", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
