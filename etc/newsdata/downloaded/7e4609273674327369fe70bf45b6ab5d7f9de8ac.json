'There is a misconception that as an industry mining does not operate with sustainable principles in mind,' they said in a statement. Mining is vital for the production of electricity, solar panels, electric car batteries, pacemakers and medical apparatus and public transport, they said. This year the conference will consider the importance of battery minerals, used in the emerging electric car market, and the growing importance of ethical investment for resource companies.\n\nThe activists picketed at multiple entrances to the centre, chanting 'land rights not mining rights, shut IMARC down' and 'blood on your hands' as they pushed back against a police line.\n\nA Victoria Police spokesman said: 'Police have arrested in excess of 20 protesters outside the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre.\n\n'The protesters were blocking the disabled and wheelchair access into the building and were asked to move but refused. Police moved in and the protesters were arrested.\n\n'One police member received minor injuries during an arrest and is receiving medical treatment at the scene.'\n\nThe International Mining and Resources Conference started on Tuesday and is set to host thousands of delegates from all over the world throughout the week.\n\nPolice say 11 different groups plan to cause 'maximum disruption' outside the conference, with protests likely to spill across parts of the CBD.\n\nMore than 300 police officers will be assigned each day to ensure activists don't break the law or adversely impact the community.\n\nThe Extinction Rebellion group ran a week of climate protests early in the month and Victoria Police acting commander Tim Tully said activists might ramp up their methods this time.\n\n'We expect to see heightened tactics by the protest groups,' he told reporters in Melbourne on Monday.\n\n'Our intelligence would suggest that the protesters have been planning, and are well co-ordinated, to undertake different tactics to what we saw, or very similar tactics to what we saw, in the recent protest activity.\n\nPictures showed a man with dreadlocks and red shorts desperately resisting officers\n\nUgly scuffles broke out as protesters blocking the disabled entrance to the city's Convention Centre had to be physically removed\n\nMore than 20 climate change protesters (pictured) were arrested on Tuesday morning as they targeted a mining conference in Melbourne\n\nA spokeswoman for one of the groups, IMARC Alliance, said they are not planning to cause havoc in the CBD. Pictured: Police use OC spray\n\n'We are well prepared to respond.'\n\nA spokeswoman for one of the groups, IMARC Alliance, said they are not planning to cause havoc in the CBD.\n\n'It's never been our intention to disrupt the city ... we want to shut down the conference using blockading tactics,' Emma Black told 3AW.\n\n'Our enemy are not motorists or the police, our enemies are the corporate mining executives.'\n\nBut her group can't control the likes of Extinction Rebellion, she said.\n\nActing commander Tully said protest groups have been unwilling to give police a good sense of what they can expect to deal with.\n\nA Victoria Police spokesman said: 'Police have arrested in excess of 20 protesters outside the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre.'
