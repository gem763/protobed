According to Viking, the marriage \u201cunfolds with love and conflict, humor and pathos.\u201d Kidd draws upon historical research, but Ana is entirely invented.\n\n\u201cI believe the aim of the novelist is not only to hold up a mirror to the world as it is, but to imagine what\u2019s possible,\u201d Kidd told The Associated Press in a recent mail. \u201cFrom the moment the idea of writing this novel struck me, I felt the importance of at least imagining a married Jesus. Doing so, provokes a fascinating question: How would the Western world be different if Jesus had married and his wife had been included in his story? There are only speculative answers, but I think Christianity and the Western world would have had a somewhat different religious and cultural inheritance, especially when it came to the egalitarian roles of women, to celibacy, and so forth. Why imagine a woman married to Jesus? Because stories of possibility challenge us to create new realities.\u201d\n\nViking announced Friday that Kidd\u2019s new book, originally titled \u201cAna, the Wife of Jesus,\u201d comes out April 28, 2020. Kidd has written about religion and spirituality in her nonfiction works, including \u201cFirstlight\u201d and \u201cThe Dance of the Dissident Daughter.\u201d\n\nThe canonical gospels make no reference to Jesus ever marrying, but scholars, conspiracists and fiction writers have long speculated whether he wed Mary Magdalene, most famously (and controversially) in Dan Brown\u2019s \u201cThe Da Vinci Code.\u201d Kidd said that her novel is, in part, a response to the marginalized status of women in the Bible.\n\n\u201cThe invisibility and silencing of women were real things. In the scriptures, women rarely have speaking parts and they aren\u2019t mentioned nearly as often as men,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cIt could even be argued that in the first-century Jewish world of Galilee, marriage was so normative, it more or less went without saying. Typically undertaken at 20 (though sometimes up to age 30), marriage was a man\u2019s civic, family and sacred duty. There are compelling reasons to support both sides of the argument. The matter is likely irresolvable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I know,\u201d she added, \u201cis that Ana wandered into my imagination and I couldn\u2019t ignore her.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sue Monk Kidd's next novel is very much a work of fiction.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Hillel Italie"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/books_sue_monk_kidd_61752_c0-878-1875-1971_s1200x700.jpg?a639580209e0a694b669e99f076390c74bfd2867", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
