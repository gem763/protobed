Photography by Dwight Primiano)\n\nAlice Walton\u2019s foundation helps rural, small-town museums share in big-city riches.\n\nArt Bridges is the new foundation established by Alice Walton in 2017 \u201cto focus on sharing outstanding works of American art across the country.\u201d I admire her. A few years ago, she established the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Ark. Starting a new museum from scratch takes passion, vision, good sense, and lots of money, and now she\u2019s building a foundation to help other museums. She\u2019s got good taste, too. Good taste and big money are, to paraphrase our local bard Robert Frost, the two roads in the whole wide world most likely to diverge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe\u2019s a patriot. It\u2019s difficult to raise money to support American art scholarship. Shows of historic American work \u2014 art before 1945 \u2014 are the hardest to promote. It doesn\u2019t have the warm patina of Old Master art, the pastel colors of impressionism, or the snap, crackle, and pop of contemporary art. Today, the teaching of American history is worthy of a class-action malpractice suit, and that affects the audience for American art in our colleges, the marketplace of collectors, and museums. Walton respects and values our heritage.\n\n\u201cOutstanding works are in museum vaults and private collections,\u201d she writes. \u201cLet\u2019s make that art available to everyone.\u201d Hallelujah. I\u2019ve written many times about the obligation big museums have to share the wealth. Channeling my inner Huey Long, I think it\u2019s a shame that established big-city museums in New York, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia sit on thousands of objects they don\u2019t have room to display, or interest in using. It\u2019s high-class hoarding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArt Bridges is only two years old. It\u2019s an emerging organization and linked to the bigger Crystal Bridges Museum enterprise, itself only a few years old. It\u2019s focusing on museums outside the big cities, some rural, some in small cities, with annual budgets of less than $5 million a year. Walton puts her money where her mouth is. Art Bridges has net assets, according to its 2018 IRS filing, of $190 million.\n\nHelping these museums is so important. There\u2019s so much creativity in these places, and so much local pride in them. A few weeks ago, Art Bridges appointed Paul Provost as the new CEO. He\u2019s an experienced curator \u2014 he led the American department at Christie\u2019s. He\u2019s savvy and intellectually sound. He\u2019s a fantastic choice. Margi Conrads is the Arts Bridges curator. She\u2019s a great curator. One of the best shows I\u2019ve seen was her reinterpretation of the Nelson-Atkins\u2019s superb American collection in Kansas City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArts Bridges is an incubator. It\u2019s doing a show called \u201cCross Pollination\u201d with the Thomas Cole National Historical Site and Olana, Frederic Church\u2019s estate, both in upstate New York. They\u2019re two of my favorite places. The Cole site \u2014 his home and studio \u2014 has just been restored. Olana, one of the great Hudson River estates, has a brilliant new curator. Art Bridges is helping these two superb but offbeat places to develop a new show connecting Martin Johnson Heade\u2019s gemlike paintings of hummingbirds and work by Cole and Church with art and science today. It\u2019s going to Crystal Bridges, Olana, the Cummer in Jacksonville, Fla., and Reynolda House in Winston-Salem, N.C.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCross Pollination is a show with heft. It puts Olana and the Cole site in the scholarly spotlight, where they should be. The Cummer is a lovely museum and garden. Reynolda House is the very good art museum at Wake Forest University. I imagine Art Bridges put its money and prestige to good use in getting all the museums and their very fine curators talking and thinking.\n\nIt also helped the Mennello Museum of American Art in Orlando and the Orlando Museum of Art do what I think will be a beautiful Edward Steichen show called \u201cIn Exaltation of Flowers.\u201d It\u2019s anchored by a set of Steichen murals \u2014 his paintings are magical \u2014 owned by Art Bridges, which also has a collection. The two museums, with Art Bridges\u2019 guidance, borrowed Steichen photographs to create, together with the murals, a beguiling show on 1920s art. What Alfred Stieglitz was to grit, Steichen was to evanescence.\n\nThese are two small museums in a place not known for art. I believe I might be the only person who has visited both but never made it to Disney World. Steichen, at the crossroads of the art nouveau and arts-and-crafts movements, is the antidote to bumper cars and water slides.\n\nArt Bridges is something else that\u2019s exceptional. It\u2019s a teacher. It\u2019s mentoring small museums that have little experience with traveling loan exhibitions. I was a curator and a museum director for years but always worked at places with scholarly history, money, a good library, and clout. I kept my elbow sharpener handy at all times, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, I found that lots of small places simply didn\u2019t know what doing a good loan show takes. Sometimes the curators were creative but timid. Sometimes the registrars were nyet-spewing old trouts. Art Bridges has its own great curators who do what they call \u201cprofessional development\u201d with small museum partners as they navigate what could be an intimidating process. The foundation opens doors, giving these places access to the big museums. Art Bridges is, in effect, an ambassador. The big city slickers are sometimes snobs \u2014 yes, there are snobs in the art world \u2014 and sometimes don\u2019t give the small places a fair shake.\n\nArt Bridges is a networker, too. Arts Bridges and the Terra Foundation in Chicago are together funding a brilliant new six-year initiative establishing partnerships between big-city museums on the one hand and small museums in places I wouldn\u2019t call remote or out-of-the-way since they\u2019re all in very fine places. Rather, I\u2019ll call them \u201cfar from the madding crowd.\u201d You can\u2019t go wrong invoking Thomas Hardy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was a very smart move on the part of Art Bridges. It was barely a year old and wanted to make an impact. So, in the spirit of collaboration, it worked with Terra, an established foundation also supporting American projects. I\u2019ll write about the Terra Foundation soon.\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, for instance, is developing shows with the Fenimore in Cooperstown, N.Y., the Mattatuck Museum in Waterbury, Conn., and the Munson-Williams-Proctor in Utica, N.Y. I\u2019ll definitely see the Elihu Vedder show in Utica. His work is bizarre and intriguing. It\u2019s a brave show since he\u2019s a difficult artist. Art Bridges is supporting it, but, more precisely, its support is essential in making the show happen. One of the big problems I have with the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities is that they support projects that are going to happen with or without federal money.\n\nThe Philadelphia Museum of Art will share art with a group of small museums in Pennsylvania, as will the Detroit Institute of Art in Michigan. The Museum of Fine Arts\u2019 collaboration is the most appealing to me since it involves some meaty new shows. The Philadelphia museum seems to be lending a handful of things I wouldn\u2019t call extraordinary to each of its sister museums for short durations. It could do a lot more \u2014 I don\u2019t think it will miss these things \u2014 but it\u2019s an auspicious start. Detroit is sending a treasures show, a nice one but nothing that sounds intellectually challenging. It\u2019s collection-sharing, though, and I hope this starts a free flow of art from Detroit to the many good, small places in Michigan, and back. These small places always have quality art, too, though the collections tend to be idiosyncratic.\n\nThese big museums are tax-exempt. They don\u2019t pay federal, state, or local taxes. They\u2019ve built collections and big endowments through years of tax-exempt philanthropy. Taxpayers \u201cfar from the madding crowd\u201d subsidize them. Though Arts Bridges and Terra are financially supporting their new collegiality, I feel they have an obligation to their smaller, less well-fixed museums.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would push the concept \u2014 and reality \u2014 of collaboration further. New England has dozens of small museums with immense American art riches. Among them are the Addison Gallery, where I was director, the college art museums at Smith, Amherst, Williams, Rhode Island School of Design, Mount Holyoke, and, of course, Yale and Harvard, and small civic museums like the New Britain Museum of American Art, the Currier in Manchester, New Hampshire, the Clark, and the Bennington Museum. There are many others.\n\nNew England is a special case, and I\u2019m not speaking merely as a lifelong Yankee. Yes, we\u2019re special, in part because there are more silos per square mile than anyplace on earth. Intellectual silos, not corn silos. For many reasons, there\u2019s also lots of good art tucked in college museums, small city museums, historical societies, house museums, and, of course, the big places like the MFA, the Peabody Essex Museum, Worcester, and the Wadsworth Atheneum.\n\nThese museums should be swapping art routinely, using the enormous, varied collective to stimulate ideas, conversations, long-term loans, and shows. Transportation costs are cheap. The curators and directors know one another. Art Bridges can get the concept of frequent, deep collaboration going and grease the mechanism with money to cover insurance costs, catalogues, research, or transportation. Curators and directors with initiative and imagination will jump. The lazy will snooze. Rewards to the entrepreneurial will be obvious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArt Bridges has a robust regimen of exhibition evaluation. This sounds good. After all, what\u2019s wrong with evaluating museum shows? Plenty. The fresh-looking, clipboard-clutching innocents interviewing museum visitors don\u2019t realize what a nefarious mission they\u2019ve been enlisted to advance.\n\nThe \u201csurveys\u201d they take are never big enough to mean anything. Each visitor gets something different \u2014 and something deliciously indescribable \u2014 from a work of art, or a group of works in a show. A good show will provoke people to think long after they\u2019ve left the clutches of the data-gatherers. A big part of a great show is the scholarly catalogue, which lasts long after the show closes. No one knows how many people use these books.\n\nThese surveys are misused by marketing people and museum staff who teach children. They often \u2014 not always \u2014 brandish these evaluations to drain content of acuity, quirkiness, complexity, and spice. They\u2019ll always find someone who\u2019s easily offended or confused or naturally dense. Years ago, a new finance director at a museum where I was a young curator wanted us to call visitors our \u201ccustomers.\u201d That\u2019s the ethos behind exhibition evaluation. It\u2019s to be deplored. Museums are for teaching and learning and pushing people aesthetically and intellectually. They\u2019re not stores.\n\nArt Bridges is great news for the beleaguered field of American art. Of course, the NEA should have shown this kind of leadership years ago.\n\nNext week, I\u2019ll write about a new Winslow Homer show at the Fogg Art Museum.", "description": "Alice Walton's Alice Walton\u2019s foundation, art Bridges, helps rural, small-town museums share in big-city riches.", "authors": ["Brian T.
