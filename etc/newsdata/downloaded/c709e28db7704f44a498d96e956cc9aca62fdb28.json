She\u2019s definitely digging an escape tunnel, right? That\u2019s either an escape tunnel or a shallow grave.\u201d\n\nIt is not the first time that Kimmel has suggested that Melania may be trying to escape the White House and her husband\u2019s clutches. Last June, he similarly mused that a sinkhole on the White House was actually one of her \u201cescape tunnels.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kimmel previously faced calls to apologize after mocking Melania Trump\u2019s Slovenian accent, although he ultimately refused to do so.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Left-wing late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel mocked First Lady Melania Trump's announcement of a new tennis pavilion at the White House on Wednesday, suggesting that she was actually trying to construct an \"escape tunnel or shallow grave.\"", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/Jimmykimmelmuellmeltdown1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
