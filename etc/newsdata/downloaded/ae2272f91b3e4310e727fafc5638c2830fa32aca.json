The disagreement is rooted in Taiwan\u2019s disputed sovereignty.\n\nChina claims Taiwan is part of its territory, and Hong Kong, a semiautonomous region of China, is wary of any arrangement that would seem to confer recognition on Taiwan\u2019s government. Taiwanese officials, for their part, have complained about a lack of cooperation from Hong Kong, and they have questioned whether they would receive enough assistance from the city\u2019s authorities to successfully prosecute Mr. Chan.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Hong Kong side, if we make a request for evidence with regards to Chan\u2019s surrender, the Hong Kong side will actively cooperate. But it also said there is no law for cooperating with Taiwan on criminal justice,\u201d Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cWe plan to ask the Hong Kong government, based on this contradictory statement, how can you provide assistance to us?\u201d\n\nHong Kong officials say such reservations risk undermining the opportunity to prosecute Mr. Chan. The city\u2019s No. 2 official, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, on Tuesday urged Taiwan not to \u201ccomplicate a simple issue\u201d or \u201ctry to exploit politics in order to achieve certain gain at the expense, particularly, of justice.\u201d.", "description": "The extradition bill that ignited Hong Kong\u2019s protests was meant to address the case of Chan Tong-kai, who is wanted in Taiwan.
