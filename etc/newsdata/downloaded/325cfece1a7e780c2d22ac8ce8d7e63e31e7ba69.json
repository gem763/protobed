Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting the company to sell about 99,000 vehicles, including 80,200 Model 3s, Tesla\u2019s mass-market vehicle.\n\nSee also: Tesla Model 3 earns top safety award from insurance group\n\nTesla delivered 84,000 vehicles in the third quarter of 2018, including about 56,000 Model 3s.\n\nThird-quarter orders were at a record, and the company has entered the current quarter with an increase in its order backlog. Nearly all of Model 3 orders came from people who did not hold a reservation, \u201csolidifying the transition to generating strong organic demand,\u201d Tesla said.\n\nAnalysts at JMP Group cut their rating on Tesla stock to their equivalent of neutral from buy, saying that Tesla not only missed quarterly sales expectations but the data showed low single-digit sequential unit growth, \u201cand we know of no operational issues that could have prevented (Tesla) from delivering more vehicles if demand were available.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put it another way, yesterday\u2019s announcement was the first time since covering the stock that we found ourselves wondering whether demand growth for (Tesla\u2019s) cars might be leveling off,\u201d said the analysts, who were led by Joseph Osha.\n\nAnalysts at Cowen, who kept their equivalent of a sell rating on the stock, went further, saying that Tesla\u2019s year-on-year \u201cgrowth story\u201d likely has ended.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see much to get excited about in the near term, and believe bulls need to be big believers in the China factory, Model Y, and autonomous narrative to justify valuation,\u201d said the analysts, led by Jeffery Osborne.\n\nRelated: Tesla stock gets buy nod from Exane BNP Paribas\n\nTesla has set a goal of delivering 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles this year, which means more than 100,000 vehicles would have to be delivered in the fourth quarter to even come close to that goal. Analysts surveyed by FactSet are expecting 357,000 units for the year.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives took a somewhat more positive view of Wednesday\u2019s delivery miss, saying it was a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d for the company and delivering more vehicles than last quarter, when Tesla delivered 95,000 units, \u201cwas an impressive feat.\u201d\n\nAnalysts at Evercore ISI also kept their rating on Tesla at their equivalent of sell, saying that they were concerned about the mix of Model S and Model X luxury vehicles. Tesla said it sold a combined 17,000 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs, whereas Evercore analysts, led by Arndt Ellinghorst, had expected 19,000 vehicles.\n\nMore worrying, however, is profitability and cash flow as the company reports third-quarter results by the end of the month or early November, they said.\n\nThird-quarter earnings \u201care the likely bellwether for the next few quarters as growth plateaus until (compact SUV Model Y) production begins in earnest,\u201d they said.\n\nDevelopments such as further-than-expected progress in the Chinese factory or a firmer date for the Model Y debut could take the stock above $250.\n\nAnalysts at Credit Suisse pointed out in a note last week that Tesla stands to report its first dip in year-on-year revenue since 2012, with FactSet expecting revenue of $6.36 billion for the third quarter compared with $6.82 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nTesla shares have lost 31% this year, contrasting with gains of 15% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.80% and 12% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
