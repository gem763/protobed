The 6 tropical storms whirling at once have tied a record\n\nOfficials in Harris County, where Houston is located, warned that some of their 4.7 million residents might not see high waters recede in their neighborhoods until the weekend.\n\nCounty officials reported at least 1,700 high-water rescues and evacuations as rising water overwhelmed the city. At least 120 people took refuge in six storm shelters.\n\nAll lanes of heavily traveled I-10, or East Freeway, were shut down Friday in both directions just east of Houston because of apparent damage to the San Jacinto River bridge, KHOU reports. The Coast Guard reportedly said nine barges broke loose on the swift-flowing river overnight, with at least two of them hitting the structure.\n\nThe weather service, forecasting scattered showers and thunderstorms for Friday, said the weather activity would not be as strong or organized as Thursday's drenching, but warned that \"rivers remain high and soil is saturated, so any additional rain could yield flooding.\"\n\nAs the torrential rains saturated the area, a 19-year-old man drowned and was electrocuted while trying to move his horse to safety, according to Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office. In Houston, a man in his 40s or 50s drowned when he tried to drive a van through 8-foot-deep floodwaters during rush hour Thursday near the George Bush Intercontinental Airport.\n\nHarris County Sheriff's Office spokesman Jason Spencer said Friday that preliminary reported indicated that a man whose body was found in a ditch north of Houston drowned from storm-related flooding. He was last seen walking during severe rainfall.\n\nOfficials in Liberty County, which adjoins Harris County to the east, issued a shelter-in-place order Thursday after some areas of the county saw as many as 26 inches of rain over the last two days, the Chronicle reported.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still putting water on top of water,\u201d said Jeff Linder, meteorologist of the Harris County Flood Control District.\n\n'Worse than Hurricane Harvey': At least 2 dead as Imelda overwhelms Texas with' incredibly dangerous' flooding\n\nIn Jefferson County, where Beaumont and Port Arthur are located, the Office of Emergency Management quoted Doug Canant, an engineer for a drainage district, as saying basins were filling and \u201cgetting water three times the amount they were designed for.\u201d\n\n\u201cRain is falling faster than we can drain,\u201d he said, according to the Beaumont Enterprise.\n\nResidents of Beaumont, which was submerged by more than 20 inches of rain in some parts, also echoed the overwhelming amount of water that caught much of the city by surprise.\n\n\u201cThe water kept rising. It kept rising. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Ruby Trahan Robinson, 63, as she settled in a shelter in a town just outside Beaumont.\n\nMany officials compared the flooding from Imelda with the devastation from Hurricane Harvey, a Category 4 storm that slammed the state in August 2017.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Houston weather: More rain but most flooding over after deadly Imelda", "description": "As floodwaters began slowing receding in Houston, police worked to clear freeways of hundreds of stranded vehicles after four\u00a0days of relentless\u00a0rain", "authors": ["Doug Stanglin", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t4IJg2YkIBLQAc0Xo3F3oQ--~B/aD0xOTIyO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/71818ce57905ba7993b0edac6f4b2824", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
