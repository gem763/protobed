Labour Students could now look at a legal challenge on the grounds it has been excluded on the basis of inaccurate information.\n\nThe move against Labour Students was condemned by a number of MPs as counterproductive at a time when the party should be focusing on preparing for an election rather than internal rows.\n\nSeveral accused the NEC of targeting Labour Students because it has links with MPs on the more centrist side of the party and is not associated with Corbyn\u2019s politics.\n\nWes Streeting, a Labour MP and former president of the National Union of Students as a Labour Students candidate, said: \u201cThe Labour party should be focusing all its energies on winning the next general election, not Jon Lansman\u2019s factional vendettas against Labour Students. It is literally student politicking, when we\u2019re in the fight our lives for the future of the country.\u201d\n\nStella Creasy, another Labour MP, added: \u201cWhy at such a critical time in our country, and with an election on the horizon, does anyone who wants Labour to be an effective force for good think this is the time for such attempts to silence parts of our youth movement ,when we need them to be seen and heard campaigning?\u201d\n\nThe motion put to the NEC said that the \u201corganisation which currently describes itself as \u2018Labour Students\u2019 claims to be an organisation affiliated to the Labour party\u201d but in fact did not meet all the terms required for affiliation. \u201cThe NEC therefore asks general secretary to urgently devise a plan to establish a Labour Students organisation which does meet its obligations,\u201d it said.\n\nThe motion passed after a lengthy meeting of the NEC before next week\u2019s party conference in Brighton.\n\nA Labour party source said: \u201cThe NEC has asked staff to draw up proposals for a reformed student organisation that complies with the rules and represents the tens of thousands of students in our party.\u201d\n\nLabour Students reacted to the motion with dismay, saying it was based on \u201cfalse and inaccurate claims which we have not had the opportunity to address\u201d.\n\nA Momentum source said: \u201cIt\u2019s a victory for democracy that the rotten borough of Labour Students has finally been reformed. There are 30,000 students in the party and Labour students had just 507 students take part in their last election. It\u2019s always been a bunker for a tiny clique who don\u2019t care about building a broad student movement in Labour, and it\u2019s right that the NEC have decided to overhaul it.\u201d", "description": "Momentum founder and Corbyn ally Jon Lansman wins NEC backing to effectively abolish Labour Students", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1db1b2095dfe4a1443fe8041e242fbe42b37820/422_0_2825_1695/master/2825.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d4a1f42c949b004274289561b6224be2", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
