(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nElena Delle Donne and the Washington Mystics put a bow on their dazzling regular season with a 100-86 win over the Chicago Sky on Sunday at Entertainment and Sports Arena. Delle Donne led all scorers with 25 points and 12 rebounds, and the presumptive WNBA MVP joined an exclusive club of sharpshooters in the process.\n\nDelle Donne became the first player in WNBA history to shoot at least 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from three-point range and 90 percent from the free throw line for a season. The NBA\u2019s Larry Bird, Steve Nash, Mark Price, Reggie Miller, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and Malcolm Brogdon are the other eight members of the 50-40-90 club.\n\n[The Wizards could learn a thing or two from the Mystics]\n\nEDD. HISTORY.\n\n\n\nTHE FIRST WNBA PLAYER TO JOIN THE 50/40/90 CLUB \ud83d\udc10\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/FcjKDqp1qA \u2014 Washington Mystics (@WashMystics) September 9, 2019\n\n\u201cCongrats @De11Donne!\u201d Nash, the former Phoenix Suns point guard who has the most 50-40-90 seasons with four, tweeted Sunday night. \u201cWelcome to the club.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsane numbers,\u201d Durant, who accomplished the feat with the Oklahoma City Thunder during the 2012-13 season, tweeted. \u201cWelcome to the club big dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cBig time Accomplishment,\u201d Curry wrote. \u201cCongrats.\u201d\n\nDelle Donne shot 51.5 percent from the field, 43.0 percent from three and 97.4 percent from the free throw line while leading the Mystics to their most regular season wins (26) in franchise history. She made 114 of her 117 free throw attempts this year, including all six of her shots from the line against the Sky.\n\nDelle Donne is a career 94 percent free throw shooter, and she has made at least 40 percent of her three-point attempts in four seasons, but this was the first season she made at least half of her field goal attempts. The 30-year-old averaged 19.5 points and 8.3 rebounds.\n\nMystics forward Emma Meesseman shot 55.2 percent from the field, 42.2 percent from three and 90.5 percent from the line during the regular season, but didn\u2019t attempt the minimum number of shots to qualify for the league leader board after taking off a month to play with the Belgian national team.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the funnest team to watch on the planet right now,\u201d Wizards General Manager Tommy Sheppard said during Sunday\u2019s win, which had no bearing on Washington\u2019s playoff positioning after the Mystics clinched the top seed \u2014 and a double bye into the semifinals \u2014 with a win Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how great they move the ball; they\u2019re so selfless. Elena Delle Donne\u2019s one of the best players on the planet.\u201d\n\nMystics fans serenaded Delle Donne with chants of \u201cM-V-P!\u201d during her on-court interview after Sunday\u2019s win.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a really fun season, especially because of the people I get to share it with,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have had this season without the help of them. They make it easy for me. We got some good fans, so I\u2019m excited for the playoffs.\u201d\n\nWashington, which is seeking its first title, will host the lowest remaining seed in Game 1 of a best-of-five semifinal series Sept. 17. The Mystics lost to the Seattle Storm in last year\u2019s WNBA Finals.\n\n\u201cWe felt it last year in Seattle, the backing that they had and how loud their building was, and now we\u2019ve got that atmosphere,\u201d Delle Donne said after the Mystics completed their first season at Entertainment and Sports Arena with a 14-3 home record.\n\nDelle Donne was also humbled by the response to her 50-40-90 season, which included congratulatory tweets from John Wall, Bradley Beal and others.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great season so far,\u201d she tweeted, \u201cbut it\u2019s not over yet! We\u2019ve got work to do.\"\n\nWho made this video?! This is awesome. Totally humbled by this. I\u2019m so grateful to my teammates for being the best, and my Mystics family for all their support. It\u2019s been a great season so far, but it\u2019s not over yet! We\u2019ve got work to do #SticsSZN https://t.co/kHWWWOnMxh \u2014 Elena Delle Donne (@De11eDonne) September 9, 2019\n\nYeahhhhh EDD!!!
