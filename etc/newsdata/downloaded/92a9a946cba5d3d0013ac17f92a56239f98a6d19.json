Bernard is nominated alongside former winner Sharon Olds, who was picked for Arias, a collection that considers a woman\u2019s intimate life and political conscience, tackling subjects from the cervix to Trayvon Martin.\n\nThe chairman of the judges, John Burnside, paid tribute to all the writers on the shortlist, calling them \u201csome of the finest and most fearless poets working today\u201d.\n\nIn a list tinged with violence, Anthony Anaxagorou was chosen for After the Formalities, which moves from the racial abuse of an Uber driver on the day of the Brexit referendum to a knife being pulled. Fiona Benson is selected for Vertigo & Ghost, a series of poems about Zeus as a serial rapist, and Ilya Kaminsky for Deaf Republic. Set in an occupied country, Kaminsky\u2019s poems tell of how when soldiers breaking up a protest kill a deaf boy, the citizens of the town all go deaf.\n\n\u201cIn an excellent year for poetry, the judges read over 150 collections from every corner of these islands, and beyond,\u201d said Burnside. \u201cEach had its own vital energy, its own argument to make, its own celebration or requiem to offer, and we knew that settling upon 10 from so many fine books would be difficult. Nevertheless, as our deliberations progressed, the same titles kept coming to the fore.\u201d\n\nVidyan Ravinthiran, who was born in Leeds to Sri Lankan Tamils, is shortlisted for his second collection, The Million-Petalled Flower of Being Here. It is a book of sonnets for his wife, many of which describe life in the north-east for a mixed-race couple.\n\nWith numerous poetry awards already under his belt, Paul Farley makes this year\u2019s list for his new collection The Mizzy. The lineup is completed by Deryn Rees-Jones\u2019s Erato, which draws its title from the muse of lyric poetry, Roger Robinson\u2019s A Portable Paradise, and Karen Solie\u2019s The Caiplie Caves. The Canadian poet\u2019s fifth collection, the latter tells of the seventh-century Irish missionary to Scotland, St Ethernan, and how he retreated to the caves of the Fife coast.\n\nAt \u00a325,000, the TS Eliot is the UK\u2019s most valuable poetry award. Previous winners include Alice Oswald, Ted Hughes and Carol Ann Duffy. The winner will be announced on 13 January 2020.\n\nThe 2019 TS Eliot prize shortlist\n\nAfter the Formalities by Anthony Anaxagorou (Penned in the Margins)\n\nVertigo & Ghost by Fiona Benson (Cape Poetry)\n\nSurge by Jay Bernard (Chatto & Windus)\n\nThe Mizzy by Paul Farley (Picador)\n\nDeaf Republic by Ilya Kaminsky (Faber & Faber)\n\nArias by Sharon Olds (Cape Poetry)\n\nThe Million-Petalled Flower of Being Here by Vidyan Ravinthiran (Bloodaxe)\n\nErato by Deryn Rees-Jones (Seren)\n\nA Portable Paradise by Roger Robinson (Peepal Tree Press)\n\nThe Caiplie Caves by Karen Solie (Picador)", "description": "Nominees for the \u00a325,000 prize include Jay Bernard, Sharon Olds and Anthony Anaxagorou", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5656f5fa22d90bf3c3489d0e65b8966febd9ea95/352_2246_3857_2315/master/3857.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dddc3d2c835dfaef97a9e3dd909c1e72", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
