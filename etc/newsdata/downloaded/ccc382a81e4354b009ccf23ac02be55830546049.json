I\u2019m grateful for that invite. As you know, my goals was always, all these years, to come into the Fast & Furious world and help elevate the franchise in any way that I possibly could. If I could do that, then I\u2019ve done my job, and now here we are 10 years later, this massively successful build-out and expansion. We did it the right way, we did it the smart way, and again, brother, I appreciate your support.\u201d\n\nHe finished things off by saying: \u201cAnd of course, all roads lead to one thing. I\u2019ll be seeing you soon, Toretto.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE Big Man With Even Bigger Heart Dwayne Johnson Bought His Dad A New House\n\nDwayne Johnson joined the beloved film series for Fast 5.
