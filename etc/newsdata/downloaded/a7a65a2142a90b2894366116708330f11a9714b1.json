Pictured: The Sir Harold Hiller Gardens in Hampshire\n\nAt night it could be down to -4C (25F), as forecast by the Met Office.\n\nEngland's first snow of winter threatens on the Pennines, with lows as cold as -6C (21F) in Scotland, said The Weather Outlook.\n\nThe UK was drenched by 122mm of rain in September, making it the wettest first month of autumn for 19 years - since the 130mm we saw in 2000.\n\nAnd October's rainfall has been 75 per cent more than average this month, Met Office figures for England and Wales show, with 80mm falling.\n\nThe Met Office forecast a warm plume from the continent to bring sunny spells and drier skies, with highs of 19C (66F) by Thursday.

We could see -4C in Scotland and -1C in England.'\n\nMet Office forecaster Craig Snell said: 'After wet conditions, high pressure and a plume from Europe sees a warming trend, with 19C possible by Thursday and Friday in the South and 18C in the North-West.'

Either an Indian Summer or Arctic blast are possible.\n\n'Cold air looks like winning the battle with mild air from October 28 as a trough of Arctic air settles across northwest Europe, due to a large-scale shift across the northern hemisphere.\n\n'Low pressure systems may slide in, providing potential for rain or snow.\n\n'Late October snow is not unheard of. There was even a blanket of snow in parts of London in 2008.'\n\nThe Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: 'Warm air from southern Europe towards the UK means highs are set to push towards 21C.\n\nEx-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond of weathertrending said: 'We could see big contrasts between cold and warm, lurching one way then the other. Either an Indian Summer or Arctic blast are possible.'
