In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have,\u201d DeGeneres explained. \u201cWe\u2019re all different and I think that we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s okay that we\u2019re all different\u2026 but just because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I say, \u2018Be kind to one another,\u2019 I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do,\u201d she added. \u201cI mean be kind to everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nHer friendship with Bush has provoked enraged responses from members of the liberal media.\n\nOut Magazine railed against the openly gay talk show host, tweeting: \u201cEllen DeGeneres laughing it up with someone who has actively tried to harm our community feels disappointing, irresponsible, and dangerous.\u201d\n\nEllen DeGeneres laughing it up with someone who has actively tried to harm our community feels disappointing, irresponsible, and dangerous. https://t.co/tgGfmCGQ5A \u2014 Out Magazine (@outmagazine) October 7, 2019\n\nThe progressive Ruffalo has staked out a series of increasingly leftist stances on issues including the Second Amendment and immigration, at one point saying \u201cwe are a country of illegal immigrants.\u201d\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
