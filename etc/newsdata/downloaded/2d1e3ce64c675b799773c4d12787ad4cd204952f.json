Contrary to the majority of those businesses, however, Vendr is already profitable.\n\nIn classic YC fashion, the company has created software to sell to other startups, and, as such, it was quick to gain the confidence of top venture capital investors. Headquartered in Boston, Vendr has raised a $2 million round led by F-Prime Capital, with participation from Ashton Kutcher\u2019s Sound Ventures, Joe Montana\u2019s Liquid2 Ventures, Garage VC and angel investors including Canva co-founder and chief operating officer Cliff Obrecht and HubSpot COO JD Sherman.\n\nThe company offers subscription-based software, priced depending on company headcount, that helps fast-growing businesses buy and manage enterprise SaaS. In short, the product cuts the human out of the sales process, allowing companies to purchase or upgrade software using software. The goal isn\u2019t to eliminate the sales profession, rather to put an end to \u201cpersuasion driven\u201d sales, Neu explains, and to make enterprise software purchases as easy as consumer product purchases.\n\n\u201cWe see software sales actually going away because most people are tired of being sold to, they are tired of being persuaded, they want to transact,\u201d Neu, who previously led sales at HubSpot, tells TechCruch. \u201cVendr was created to allow people to transact software without actually having to talk to people.\u201d\n\nFounded 14 months ago, Vendr has reached $1 million in annual recurring revenue, which, for context, has historically been amongst the benchmarks necessary for a SaaS startup to raise its Series A. Neu says the company is growing 15% month-over-month with monthly recurring revenue currently sitting at $96,500. Already profitable, Neu says they want to put themselves in a position in which they don\u2019t have to raise any additional outside capital.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine looking at the bank account every month and watching it deplete,\u201d Neu said. \u201cWe want to be in a position where we can control our own destiny.\u201d\n\nVendr currently operates with a team of six employees and 19 customers, including Canva, Grammarly, GitLab, Brex, HubSpot and InVision. The company is also backed by Okta\u2019s general counsel Jon Runyan, AppDynamics\u2019 COO Dan Wright and YC partner Aaron Epstein.", "description": "Y Combinator graduate Vendr helps companies manage and renew enterprise software.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Vendr-2.jpg?w=604", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
