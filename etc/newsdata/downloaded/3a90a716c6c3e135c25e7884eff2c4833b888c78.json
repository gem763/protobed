Combine that with the earnings today being good and happy days are here again,\" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> gained 0.97% while the FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> index of leading European regional shares closed up 0.93%. The broad pan-European STOXX 600 index <.STOXX> rose 1.11%.\n\nOptimism over a potential Brexit deal helped allay concerns about a slowing economy brought on by the U.S.-China trade war, which has crimped German exports.\n\nBut the mood among German investors worsened less this month than analysts had expected, a ZEW survey showed, amid concern that Europe's biggest economy might be headed for recession.\n\nZEW's headline economic sentiment index, which in August touched its lowest in almost seven years, appears to have stabilized. But investor assessment of German's current economic condition in October was as pessimistic as it was in 2010.\n\nUpbeat results from JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>, UnitedHealth Group Inc <UNH.N> and Johnson & Johnson <JNJ.> eased concerns about the impact from a prolonged U.S.-China trade war on corporate America.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 297.64 points, or 1.11%, to 27,085. The S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 35.25 points, or 1.19%, to 3,001.4 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 112.75 points, or 1.4%, to 8,161.40.\n\nChinese stocks snapped a five-day winning streak after the latest factory gate data added to China's economic woes and the end of the trade war remained elusive.\n\nThe dollar index <.DXY> fell 0.14%, with the euro <EUR=> up 0.02% to $1.103. The Japanese yen <JPY=> weakened 0.42% versus the greenback at 108.88 per dollar.\n\nSterling <GBP=> rose to $1.2774, up 1.33% on the day.\n\nOil futures closed lower. Brent crude <LCOc1> fell 61 cents to settle at $58.74 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude <CLc1> dropped 78 cents to settle at $52.81 a barrel.\n\nPrices for the benchmark U.S. Treasury's 10-year note <US10YT=RR> fell, pushing its yield up to 1.7745%.\n\nEuro zone government bonds sold off after media reports that UK and EU negotiators were close to a draft deal on Brexit boosted investors' risk appetite.\n\nIrish government bonds outperformed euro zone peers on Brexit hopes. Yields on Irish 10-year bonds were back in negative territory at -0.02% <IE10YT=RR> after sliding 6 basis points on the day.\n\nDublin-listed shares surged 2.6% to the highest since September 2018 <.ISEQ>.\n\nBritain is Ireland's largest trading partner and its border with the British province of Northern Ireland has been the thorniest issue in Brexit negotiations.\n\nGold fell 1% as growing risk appetite boosted investor demand for equities.\n\nU.S. gold futures <GCcv1> settled down 0.9% at $1,483.50 an ounce.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Nick Macfie and Lisa Shumaker)", "description": "", "authors": ["Herbert Lash"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xtxCVG1pE_tVM.rcBTNK1Q--~B/aD0yOTg7dz00NDk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/0a4e886818d708b65c27ad610d942a55", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
