In the south of the country in the port city of Sidon and further toward Nabatieh, locals closed down highways and vandalised political parties\u2019 offices, including a Hizbollah MPs office.\n\nIn the north where Saad Hariri, the prime minister, enjoys widespread support posters of him were torn down in the streets.\n\nA protester flashes victory signs in front a fire set by protesters to block a road during a protest in Beirut, Credit: EPA More\n\nIn the country\u2019s capital of Beirut, young men and women chanted \u201cdown with the regime,\u201d as they had intermittent clashes with security forces.\n\nThe Lebanese newspaper an-Nahar described it as \"a tax intifada\", or uprising, across Lebanon. Another daily, al-Akhbar, declared it \"the WhatsApp revolution\" that had shaken Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri's unity government.\n\nSmaller number of protesters began gathering again on Friday morning.\n\nLebanon is currently facing a difficult economic situation with the local currency, which is pegged to the US dollar, fluctuating in the black market.\n\nBakery owners, gas station owners and other businesses have gone on strike in recent weeks to protest the current situation.\n\nGas station owners purchase fuel in dollars but are paid in Lebanese liras; however, with the shortage of U.S. dollars in the market banks were not exchanging their liras to dollars. The same situation applies to the bakery owners. An agreement has since been reached with both.\n\nThe government is currently discussing the 2020 budget, which calls for austerity measures as the country continues to rack up public debt that stands at $80 billion.\n\nCEDRE, an economic donor conference held in Paris last year saw the international community pledge more than $11 billion in soft loans and grants. But this requires a number of economic reforms to be carried out before the funds are unlocked.\n\nThursday\u2019s protests were arguably the biggest protests since 2015 when thousands also took to the streets after garbage piled up in the streets across the country due to a lack of proper waste management plan.", "description": "Rare mass demonstrations broke out across Lebanon on Thursday night as tens of thousands took to the streets calling for the downfall of the current government, which is headed by an ally of the West.
