But if you still find the new console too heavy to hold for long periods, 8BitDo\u2019s created a new Switch Lite specific wireless controller that\u2019s as streamlined and optimised for portability as the console itself is.\n\nNew Videos Suggest The Nintendo Switch Lite Might Have A Drift Problem Too A teardown of the new Nintendo Switch Lite shared on YouTube revealed the new handheld console\u2019s joysticks are very similar to those used on the original Switch, leading many to speculate that joystick drift could still be a problem. Read more\n\nDesigned to match the colours of the yellow or turquoise Switch Lites (those who bought the grey option will have to make do with a little more colour) the 8BitDo Lite controller prioritises portability over functionality with a thin design, and as a result it includes every single button you\u2019ll find on the Lite console, minus the two analogue joysticks.\n\nPlayers will instead rely on a pair of left and right directional pads, which means the 8BitDo Lite might be better suited to playing the collection of classic 8 and 16-bit games available through Nintendo\u2019s online service, instead of flagship titles such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\n\nThe 8BitDo Lite will cost $US25 ($37), and it\u2019s expected to ship on October 30. In addition to the Switch Lite and the original Nintendo Switch, the controller should also work with devices running Windows, macOS and Android. But even with the iOS 13.1 update now out which adds support for PS4 and Xbox One controllers to make Apple Arcade more enjoyable, 8BitDo\u2019s controllers still aren\u2019t iOS-friendly.\n\nHopefully, that will change soon, as the company makes some of the best tiny controllers on the market.", "description": "Without the ability to connect it to a TV, there\u2019s less of a reason for gamers to use a wireless gamepad with the new Nintendo Switch Lite.
