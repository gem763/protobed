It requires dedication, discipline and endurance.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a crucial difference.\n\nWhen you cross the finish line in a marathon, you know the race is over. But when you quit the workforce, it\u2019s much harder to figure out whether you\u2019ve successfully reached retirement. Why? A happy and prosperous retirement is about money, but it\u2019s also about so much more than money. Here are 15 signs that a wonderful retirement likely lies ahead:\n\n1. You don\u2019t need an online calculator to tell you that you have enough money, because it\u2019s so obvious you can do the math yourself.\n\n2. Your Social Security benefit will cover your fixed living expenses\u2014and you can afford to wait until age 70, so you get a larger check.\n\n3. Your Social Security and required minimum distributions from retirement accounts will together cover all your expenses, discretionary and nondiscretionary.\n\n4. You don\u2019t pay attention to the stock market\u2019s daily movements, because you\u2019re confident you have enough, pretty much no matter what happens.\n\nRead: How retirees should plan for an imminent recession\n\n5. You decide to get a part-time job not because you have to, but because you want to.\n\n6. You have a spouse or significant other who does little things, like straighten your shirt or hold your hand, to let you know that he or she will be there for you to the very end.\n\nRead: 10 things I wish I knew about retirement before I retired\n\n7. Your adult children visit you not to borrow money or drop off the grandkids, but to say \u201chello\u201d and ask how you\u2019re doing and if you need anything.\n\n8. You wake up in the morning thinking it\u2019s Thursday and you need to rush to meet Diane and Stan for breakfast. But a few seconds later, you realize it\u2019s only Wednesday and you have a lunch engagement with Cindy and Steve.\n\n9. You turn 65 and enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan. You opt for the lower tier, less expensive plan, because you don\u2019t take medication on a daily basis.\n\n10. Your medical costs primarily consist of the Medicare and supplemental insurance premiums you pay each month.\n\n11. You\u2019re aware of how long-term care can adversely affect your life and your financial future. But you feel confident about your physical health, because you eat your salad and your grilled fish after another energetic workout at the gym.\n\nRead: 16 ways to make life better for your spouse after you die\n\n12. You say to yourself: \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m xx years old. I don\u2019t feel it.\u201d\n\n13. With more time on your hands, you discover new things about yourself\u2014like a new talent you didn\u2019t know you had.\n\n14. You stop and look at the sunrise and sunset, because you now have time to notice such things\u2014and you want to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\n15. You have a reason to get up in the morning and a feeling of contentment when you lie down at night.\n\nDennis Friedman retired from Boeing Satellite Systems after a 30-year career in manufacturing.
