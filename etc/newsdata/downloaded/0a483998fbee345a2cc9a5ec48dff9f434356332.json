The rest of the District would become known as the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth.\n\nQ and A on D.C. Statehood: What you need to know\n\nAt the hearing, Republicans argued the District is too corrupt and financially dependent on the federal government to be a state.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), the top Republican on the committee, moved to subpoena D.C. council member Jack Evans (D), who is the target of a federal grand jury probe into his official actions and his private consulting business.\n\n\u201cWe cannot ignore the ele\u00adphant in the room,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThe District government currently faces serious allegations of misconduct.\u201d\n\nNorton, the District\u2019s nonvoting representative in Congress, said the allegations against Evans have nothing to do with statehood, sounding off against Jordan\u2019s state.\n\n\u201cCertainly officials in Ohio have been the subject of multiple political scandals for many years,\u201d she said. \u201cBut no one is suggesting that Ohio ought to lose its status.\u201d\n\nD.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) and Jeffrey S. DeWitt, the District\u2019s chief financial officer, pushed back on claims that the city is struggling financially by citing its AAA bond rating, $28.4 billion in annual tax receipts and $15.5 billion budget. The mayor noted that the city\u2019s population of more than 700,000 \u2014 more than the states of Vermont and Wyoming \u2014 is projected to keep growing.\n\nDistrict officials said transition issues would have to negotiated between the D.C. and federal governments.\n\nFor example, the legislation is silent on how the District would disentangle itself from the federal government, which pays more than $1 billion annually to fund Medicaid and much of the city\u2019s criminal justice system \u2014 including the courts, prison services and supervision of offenders released into the community.\n\nNone of that seemed to matter to hundreds of statehood supporters wearing shirts emblazoned with \u201cStatehood\u201d or the District flag who formed a line that snaked down the hallways and around corners of the Rayburn House Office Building.\n\nA crowd gathered outside in nearby Spirit of Justice Park and watched the proceedings live on a large video screen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wrong,\u201d Jacqui Lieberman, 58, of Cleveland Park. \u201cI pay my taxes. I send my kids to school. Why shouldn\u2019t I have a representative in Congress?\n\nFor a historically African American city to lack a vote in Congress, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s clear racism.\u201d\n\nStatehood supporters are optimistic they can win a House floor vote in the majority-Democratic chamber but acknowledge the legislation has no chance in the Senate, where Republicans have the majority.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said making the District a state would give Democrats an undue advantage because the city\u2019s diverse and politically liberal electorate is likely to elect two Democratic senators, increasing the party\u2019s influence.\n\nA Gallup poll released in July found a clear majority of Americans \u2014 64 percent \u2014 do not think the nation\u2019s capital should attain statehood, compared to 29 percent who support the idea.\n\nSenate Republicans are united in opposing statehood for the District, a move that some say would violate the intention of the framers of the Constitution. Both sides agree if the bill were ever to pass both chambers it would face a legal challenge that would likely reach the Supreme Court.\n\nOpposition to the bill prompted one of the sharpest exchanges of the hearing, between Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), a statehood supporter, and Roger Pilon, a constitutional scholar from the libertarian Cato Institute, testifying for the opposition.\n\n\u201cI fear that the party of Lincoln that led us to the 13th and 14th and 15th amendment, that won the Civil War, is increasingly sounding like the party of Stonewall Jackson and Jefferson Davis,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cWhen they say it\u2019s not about race and partisanship, you can be sure it\u2019s about race and partisanship.\u201d\n\nPilon responded there are partisan elements to the debate, but said, \u201cThis is not about race.\u201d He urged Connolly to withdraw the comment.\n\n\u201cNever!\u201d Connolly said, spurring a roar of applause.\n\nPresidential candidates and other Democrats took notice of the hearing, the first in the House since 1993. The Senate held a statehood hearing five years ago.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) tweeted about it and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) stopped by, as did Reps. Jennifer Wexton (Va.) and Steny H. Hoyer (Md.), the House majority leader.\n\nHoyer, who reversed his long-held opposition to statehood in May, addressed the hearing and quoted the namesake of the would-be state, Frederick Douglass.\n\n\u201cPower concedes nothing without a demand,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said the disenfranchisement of D.C. residents \u201cupholds the injustices of slavery.\u201d\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) told Bowser she wanted one of the American flags that feature 51 stars, which the city hung from lampposts along Pennsylvania Avenue this week.\n\nAs staff held up the flag in the hearing, Norton said, \u201cSee, you can\u2019t even tell the difference. What\u2019s the harm?\u201d\n\nEvery D.C. Council member \u2014 except for Evans and Mary Cheh (D-Ward 3) \u2014 was at the hearing in the audience behind Bowser.\n\n\u201cAll the members are here, except the guy we want to be here?\u201d Jordan asked Mendelson, referring to Evans.\n\nJordan and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) noted that the proposed boundaries for the new state included the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, which leases its building from the federal government. They wanted to know why the Trump property would be part of the state and not part of the federal enclave.\n\n\u201cThere are federal properties in Maryland, in Virginia and in states across the country,\u201d Bowser said, adding that the Hotel Monaco in Penn Quarter also leases space from the federal government and would be inside the state boundary.\n\nJordan asked Mendelson if the city put the Trump hotel inside the proposed state boundaries because it wants the tax revenue.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of a crass way to put it, but yeah,\u201d Mendelson said.\n\nMassie said the boundaries could force congressional staffers to park outside the downsized capital, giving the new state too much leverage over the federal government.\n\n\u201cThis is the ridiculousness you get into when you try to draw a federal city into a teacup,\u201d he said.\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Republicans declared the District too corrupt and financially insecure to be the 51st state.", "authors": ["Jenna Portnoy", "Reporter Covering Virginia", "Maryland", "D.C.
