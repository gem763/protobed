There are women who really like the song and connect to the energy that just gets you up. And I know you want it \u2013 women sing those kinds of lyrics all the time. So it\u2019s like, What\u2019s rapey about that?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe said that he came to understand that the language used in the song is also used by men \u201cwhen taking advantage of a woman, and it doesn\u2019t matter that that\u2019s not my behaviour. Or the way I think about things. It just matters how it affects women.\u201d\n\nWilliams \u201crealised that we live in a chauvinist culture in our country. Hadn\u2019t realised that. Didn\u2019t realise some of my songs catered to that. So that blew my mind.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams: Blurred Lines \u2013 video\n\nIn 2013, Williams repeatedly refuted the suggestion that the song endorsed coercive behaviour. \u201cWhen you pull back and look at the entire song, the point is: She\u2019s a good girl, and even good girls want to do things, and that\u2019s where you have the blurred lines,\u201d he told US music magazine Pitchfork. \u201cShe expresses it in dancing because she\u2019s a good girl. People who are agitated just want to be mad, and I accept their opinion.\u201d\n\nDespite the backlash, the song went to No 1 in countries around the world, including the UK and the US, and some critics disputed the interpretation of the lyrics.\n\nFrom Blurred Lines to New Rules: how sex in pop has changed for ever Read more\n\n\u201cIt could definitely refer to the tired, overused good-girl-with-a-freaky-streak fantasy,\u201d wrote Slate magazine\u2019s Jennifer Lai. \u201cOr, perhaps it really is about getting mixed signals from a lady who you think might be interested in doing the deed \u2013 and then letting her know exactly where you stand so she can make the next move \u2013 if she wants.\u201d\n\nThe dispute was not the end of Williams and Thicke\u2019s strife regarding the song. In March 2015, a jury found Thicke and Williams liable for copyright infringement based on the hit\u2019s similarity to Marvin Gaye\u2019s Got to Give It Up. They were ordered to pay $7.4m to Gaye\u2019s estate, followed by a second payment of $5m following a final judgment in December 2018.\n\nThe case has become a lightning rod for discussions about the limitations of musical inspiration.", "description": "In an interview, Williams says he has now realised the song, made with Robin Thicke, contributed to sexism", "authors": ["Laura Snapes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3584dba8d2a9dd14a8aac169be330f9d108a55d9/58_272_2840_1704/master/2840.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=32191b2cf9051547311760ec6fb50f94", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
