It's largely successful in the admirable quest to prevent blisters, heel chafing, and other foot pains. We can personally confirm through experiences with its sneakers, boots, and dress shoes.\n\nIts newest collection, Grand Ambition, tackles the challenge of making women's dress shoes you can wear all day. Instead of keeping them at your desk strictly for office wear, these pumps, wedges, flats, and sneakers are versatile enough to still see the light of day and be worn out and about with no second thought.\n\nWhile Cole Haan's Grand collection focuses on sneakers, Grand Ambition features more formal, dressy shoes. I tried one of the styles, the Grand Ambition Skimmer, a $160 pointed flat.\n\nIts sleek style draws you in, but its comfortable, supportive feel is ultimately what makes you want to wear the shoe over and over again.\n\nWhat the Grand Ambition Skimmer flats look and feel like\n\nThe shoes on my size 7 feet. Connie Chen/Business Insider\n\nThe flats have a slim body that end in a point. If you have a wider foot or know your toes tend to get squished by pointed flats, fret not \u2014 there's a wide size option.\n\nThey come in three leather colors including black, pink, and snake print, but the one I tried was the calfhair jaguar, a fun print that fulfills the unofficial requirement to own at least one jaguar or leopard-printed item in your wardrobe.\n\nCole Haan worked with the University of Massachusetts Amherst's Biomechanics laboratory to design all the Grand Ambition shoes. The Skimmer has molded footbeds that contain the brand's patented GrandFoam comfort technology \u2014 that is, three layers of shock absorbing, weight distributing foam.\n\nThis adaptive cushioning means that your feet and body are comfortable no matter how you're moving. I walk a lot in the city, but I also often have to stand and wait in lines and for my perpetually delayed trains and equally tardy friends. Standing around in uncomfortable shoes, I've realized, can really speed up the rate at which you convert from plain impatience to full-on crankiness.\n\nIn the Skimmer flats, however, I feel comfortable walking and standing all day. And while the shoe contours to your foot, it's not in an oppressive, non-breathable way. My feet stay dry but the shoes still fit perfectly, with no gaping or slippage. There's also a neoprene lining so the shoe doesn't cut into the top of your feet.\n\nThe bottoms of the shoes are made from a textured material, so I have some traction and don't slip the moment I step onto a slick surface.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nI've tried my fair share of flats from top brands like Everlane, Allbirds, Margaux, and Rothy's. Cole Haan's entrance into the rotation means it's even harder for me to decide which pair of comfortable flats I should wear. Of the group, I will say Cole Haan has the best expertise in and reputation for footwear technology. Even though the Skimmers are pricey at $150 to $160 a pair, they're also the most thoughtfully designed flats you can buy.", "description": "All the shoes in the Cole Haan Grand Ambition women's collection feature GrandFoam cushioning, which absorbs shock and distributes weight.", "authors": ["Connie Chen"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d497b37100a241463377905?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
