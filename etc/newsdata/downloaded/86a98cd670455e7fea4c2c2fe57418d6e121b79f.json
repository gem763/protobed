Eliot Engel, Adam Schiff, and Elijah Cummings \u2014 who respectively chair the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight committees \u2014 released text messages between government officials discussing the United States\u2019 relationship with Ukraine that they say \u201creflect serious concerns\u201d related to the complaint raised by a whistleblower.\n\nThe release comes as part of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, following the whistleblower\u2019s claim that he used his office to \u201csolicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d\n\nThe conversations primarily involved William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine; Kurt Volker, former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine; Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union; Andrey Yermak, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky; and Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nVolker, who resigned last week, voluntarily testified in front of lawmakers for nearly ten hours on Thursday, and submitted the texts for their review. Sondland will appear for a closed-door deposition on Oct. 8, according to CBS News.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election,\u201d she said. In this vein, Trump\u2019s focus on a potential 2020 rival, Biden, could potentially be viewed as attempting to affect the election.\n\nIn another chain of messages on Aug. 9, Sondland and Volker discuss the timing of what was a then-prospective White House visit, set to be scheduled \u201cas soon as Yermak confirms.\u201d Texts that follow seem to refer to a \u201cdeliverable\u201d allegedly requested by President Trump \u2014 a written statement in which Zelensky would announce that Ukraine was investigating 2016 election interference and whether malfeasance was involved in an investigation into Burisma.\n\n\u201cOnce we have a date, will call for a press briefing announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations,\u201d Yermak wrote to Volker on Aug. 10.\n\nVolder and Sondland proceeded to discuss the specifics of what the press statement should include on both Aug. 13 and 17, sharing passages they expected it to include.\n\n\u201cSpecial attention should be paid to the problem of interference in the political processes of the United States especially with the alleged involvement of some Ukrainian politicians. I want to declare that this is unacceptable. We intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 U.S. elections, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this problem in the future,\u201d Sondland said in the first conversation which Engel, Schiff, and Cummings say occurred after Volker had reached out to Giuliani for guidance.\n\nIn the follow-up exchange on Aug. 17th, Sondland tells Volker he wants Ukraine to send them a \u201cclean draft\u201d of the statement.\n\nThat statement in question has not yet been released. (Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general\u2019s office did announce Friday it would reinvestigate Burisma; however, the prosector said, \u201cNo foreign or domestic politicians\u2026 tried to influence my decision.\u201d)\n\nInstead, at the end of August, Yermak texted Volker an article about Trump\u2019s decision to withhold congressionally approved military aid from Ukraine, which was ultimately released Sept. 11. \u201cNeed to talk to you,\u201d Yermak said. \u201cHi Andrey \u2014 absolutely. When is good for you?\u201d Volker responded on Aug. 29. At the time, Trump was scheduled to go to Poland and meet with Zelensky, but said he had to stay Stateside to monitor the trajectory of Hurricane Dorian. Vice President Pence met with Zelensky on Sept. 1 in Trump\u2019s place.\n\nThe same day, Taylor sent a message to Sondland questioning what would be required for Zelensky to get his White House invite. \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d wrote Taylor. Instead of answering via text, Sondland told Taylor to call him.\n\nThe subject of withholding aid for campaign assistance, as Taylor appeared to view the situation, came up again about a week later. \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d wrote Taylor.\n\nIt took Sondland five hours to reply to Taylor\u2019s concern. In a pointed message, he denied the suggestion that Trump was leveraging anything in return for Zelensky\u2019s commitment to investigate, and suggested the officials should stop communicating about the matter over texting. \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suggest we stop the back and forth by text,\u201d Sondland added.\n\nHis response was the final message the committee chairmen shared publicly.\n\nWrite to Abby Vesoulis at abby.vesoulis@time.com.", "description": "The messages' release, provided by former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, comes as part of Democrats' impeachment inquiry into President Trump", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/kurt-volker-ukraine-text-messages.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
