REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri\n\nDuring a meeting at Ethiopia\u2019s foreign ministry in July, officials were shocked by social media reports that their prime minister was visiting Eritrea.\n\nNo one in the room had been informed of Abiy\u2019s trip, his second since clinching his peace deal last year.\n\n\u201cThe foreign office was not in the loop,\u201d said a senior official who was present. \u201cWe learned of it from the Eritrean media, on Facebook and Twitter.\u201d\n\nThe surprise visit is typical of Abiy, who both fans and critics say often relies on bold personal initiatives and charisma to drive change instead of working through government institutions.\n\nNebiat Getachew, the foreign ministry spokesman, said policy was well co-ordinated. He did not confirm if Abiy had made the July trip without informing the ministry.\n\nBut Abiy\u2019s unpredictable style annoys some Ethiopians.\n\nIt is unclear how much of the fractious ruling coalition backs his reforms, or how durable they would be without him. He has already survived one assassination attempt: a grenade thrown at a rally last year.\n\nLasting change cannot be built through a \u201ccult of personality\u201d, said Comfort Ero, Africa programme director at the International Crisis Group think tank.\n\n\u201cNone of Abiy\u2019s promised transformational reforms are going to have any solid foundations unless he works through the institutions,\u201d she said.\n\nEthiopia has been among Africa\u2019s fastest growing economies. But uncertainty over Abiy\u2019s ability to carry out all his reforms worries both Ethiopians and foreign investors.\n\nPERSONAL STYLE OR CANNY STRATEGY?\n\nSome observers say Abiy, a former military officer, will sometimes bypass ministries because his reforms will otherwise become mired in bureaucracy.\n\nThose reforms - including unbanning political parties, releasing imprisoned journalists and prosecuting officials accused of torture - have drawn ecstatic crowds at rallies.\n\n\u201cAbiy seems to have relied on his charismatic rule,\u201d said Dereje Feyissa, a professor at Addis Ababa University. \u201cThe question is whether this is sustainable. Euphoria is subsiding.\u201d\n\nOther observers say Abiy\u2019s rapid changes are a deliberate attempt to wrong-foot opponents from the previous administration, which was dominated by Tigrayans.\n\nAbiy, 43, is from the Oromo group, which spearheaded the protests that forced his predecessor to resign. Since taking office in April 2018, Abiy\u2019s government has arrested or fired many senior officials - mainly Tigrayans - for corruption or rights abuses.\n\nFOREIGN POLICY\n\nOne of Abiy\u2019s biggest victories was the peace deal, signed in July last year, which ended a nearly 20-year military stalemate with Eritrea following their 1998-2000 border war.\n\nAsle Sveen, a historian who has written several books about the Nobel Peace Prize, told Reuters the deal made Abiy exactly the kind of candidate Alfred Nobel had envisaged for the prize.\n\n\u201cThe peace deal has ended a long conflict with Eritrea, and he is very popular for having done this, and he is doing democratic reforms internally,\u201d Sveen said.\n\nBut some benefits of the peace were short-lived. Land borders opened in July but closed in December with no official explanation.\n\nNebiat, the foreign ministry spokesman, said Eritrea and Ethiopia had restored diplomatic relations, air links and phone connections. \u201cOther engagements are well underway to further institutionalize relations,\u201d he said.\n\nPERSONAL INITIATIVES\n\nAbiy\u2019s diplomatic forays tend to be bold personal initiatives, analysts and diplomats said.\n\nThe foreign ministry has been \u201ccompletely sidelined,\u201d said the senior ministry official, adding that \u201cour interests abroad may be jeopardized\u201d.\n\nHe said Abiy had engaged with Eritrea, Somalia and wealthy Gulf states on major policy issues without building consensus within his government.\n\nNebiat disputed that.\n\n\u201cThere is always a well-coordinated foreign policy and diplomacy implementation within the Ethiopian government,\u201d he said. \u201cAny other claims are simply baseless.\u201d\n\nSome nations are pleased by Abiy\u2019s personal touch.\n\nAfter Sudanese police killed more than 100 protesters in June, Abiy flew to Khartoum to convince Sudan\u2019s new military rulers and the opposition to restart talks, and persuaded Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to back his mediation. The talks led to a power-sharing accord in August.\n\nAt home, Abiy\u2019s public renunciation of past abuses drew a line between his administration and that of his predecessor. He appointed former dissidents to senior roles.\n\nBut ethnically tinged violence flares frequently, and systemic attempts to address past injustices have been slow. A reconciliation commission set up in December has an unclear mandate, lacks expertise and has only met twice, said Laetitia Bader, an Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\n\u201cThe jury is still out on whether the move will be more than mere window dressing,\u201d Bader said.", "description": "Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for ending 20 years of hostility with neighbouring Eritrea, can arouse strong reactions at home.", "authors": ["Maggie Fick", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439638230&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0U0-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
