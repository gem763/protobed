The research paper, which will be presented at the CHI Play conference in Barcelona on October 24th, explains that crypto-games are video games with a fully or partially distributed ledger architecture that runs on top of a cryptocurrency network, giving players provable ownership over the virtual goods. The studied games comprise of about 16,000 player accounts, the article says, adding that this is still a niche phenomenon when compared to the games industry in general. The researchers chose Ethereum as it's \u201cthe oldest dapp-supporting cryptocurrency and the most established as measured by market capitalization.\u201d\n\nTable 2. Sample of popular Ethereum crypto-games covered in this paper. For each, we report (a) the number of active user accounts, trading volumein Ethereum (ETH) and Great British Pounds (GBP), and average spend per account in GBP over the past 30 days on the sampling date of March 6,2019. We also report (b) which gambling criteria each game matches.

To each of the games they applied the combination of legal and psychological definitions of gambling, which have been used in other areas of gaming. The psychological definition focuses on the behavior enabled by the activity, while the legal definition focuses on the financial components of outcomes. They found that \u201cthat all of the games in the sample meet our combined definition.\u201d\n\nAs seen in the table above, all nine games meet the five combined criteria:\n\nThe exchange is determined by the outcome of a future event, which is unknown at the time of betting The outcome of the future event is at least partly due to chance An exchange of money/objects of financial value occurs, typically without productive work from either side Losses can be avoided by not taking part in the activity Real-world money can be obtained by \u2018cashing out\u2019 winnings.\n\nThese games, the researchers found, allow their players to exchange virtual goods for cryptocurrency, which can then further be exchanged for fiat money, so they are \u201can instance of real-money gaming,\u201d comparable to loot boxes and gacha games that worry the regulatory authorities. \u201cAs in many online games, crypto-games allow players to trade or auction such in-game items in exchange for in-game currency. Unlike most free-to-play games, in crypto-games, the in-game currency is often exchangeable and can be used to pay for other goods and services outside gameplay, and can be exchanged back for real currency,\u201d the study states.\n\nFocusing on the sampled games only, and not on crypto-games in general, the researchers found that these games \u201ctie crypto-currency investments for in-game items and actions to chance-based mechanics.\u201d The difference from many other games is that these nine games require players to pay for items and actions before chance-based events, which makes them \u201csimilar to the gambling mechanics of betting.\u201d\n\nOliver Scholten, PhD Student in Computer Science, said: \u201cUnlike games with loot boxes, all crypto-games in the study allowed the direct or indirect exchange of in-game items for real money, making them more readily fit criteria of gambling.\u201d All this doesn\u2019t mean that the technology should not be used to build games on, says Scholten, but that \u201cdesigners need to think carefully about how their decisions may affect player spending.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the underlying technologies are new, the cryptocurrency field is undergoing rapid evolution, and it is possible that the types of issues raised by the research may become more mainstream over the next few years,\u201d the article says. The study adds that crypto-games are growing in popularity and have attracted large financial investments from players. The development of a set of design-specific criteria, based on the five point criteria set presented in the paper, the researchers say, may help crypto-game developers not to unintentionally create gambling platforms when wanting to make non-gambling games.\n\nMeanwhile, interestingly, we\u2019ve reported back in August that a prominent Shariah advisory firm specializing in Islamic finance solutions, Amanie Advisors, in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation, looked into the Ethereum platform and its native currency Ether, to see if they violate any prohibition and if they are permissible for the Islamic community. They found that Ether is Shariah-Compliant, but only until it's used for profit, and any sort of gambling is certainly forbidden.", "description": "Recent research by the University of York found that Ethereum-based crypto-games in fact meet definitions of gambling.", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5db/04dc7df43f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
