Following the contest, Cousins was told that the White House was looking for him.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nCousins initially believed this was some elaborate prank by his agent, but called the phone number the White House left for him anyway. Someone picked up, and told Cousins to hold for the president. Moments later, President Donald Trump was on the phone congratulating Cousins on the team\u2019s win.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIf you think that sounds random, Cousins agrees.\n\nMore Kirk Cousins on call from Trump: \"I just called him on the bus heading to the airport and I didn't know. I was just calling the White House and they said, 'Hold for the president.' It was just a 30-second call saying congratulations. ... Very out of the blue. Very random\" \u2014 Chris Tomasson (@christomasson) October 9, 2019\n\nCousins also explained his rationale behind making the call.\n\nMore Kirk Cousins on call from President Trump: \"When the president calls, I don't care who it is, left, right, whatever, down the middle. And if he says call me, I'm going to give him a call and see what he wants.'' \u2014 Chris Tomasson (@christomasson) October 9, 2019\n\nTrump and Cousins have a history. The two golfed together in 2017, when Cousins still played in Washington. When asked about his decision to golf with the president in 2017, Cousins used a similar \u201cleft, right, whatever\u201d line. Cousins also called Trump \u201cfriendly\u201d and \u201ceasy to talk to.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Cousins and Trump have a prior relationship, that doesn\u2019t explain why Trump wanted to congratulate Cousins after a regular-season win. That type of thing is usually reserved for players who win the Super Bowl.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
