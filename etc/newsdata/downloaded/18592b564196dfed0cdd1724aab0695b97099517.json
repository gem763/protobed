REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo/File Photo\n\nBelow are details of major companies placed on the blacklist, which effectively bans them from buying components from U.S. companies. The move is likely to impact not just them but also their suppliers, customers and financial backers.\n\nHIKVISION\n\nFormally known as Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, the firm is the world\u2019s largest purveyor of video surveillance systems.\n\nIt is also a vendor to police agencies in Xinjiang, where a sweeping crackdown on Uighurs has drawn international condemnation.\n\nHikvision has not been allowed to sell to U.S. federal government agencies since mid-August thanks to a law that blocked five Chinese firms as possible security threats because their products could allow access to sensitive systems.\n\nThe company, which has a market value of about $42 billion, is 42% owned by Chinese state investors and its two key founders. It pulls nearly 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) in annual revenue from overseas.\n\nHikvision does not disclose suppliers, but Japan\u2019s video interface firm Techpoint Inc said in a regulatory filing in March that Hikvision accounted for 62% of its annual revenue in 2018.\n\nLosing business with Hikvision could have a material and adverse effect on its business, the Japanese firm said.\n\nJohn Honovich, founder of surveillance video research company IPVM, said Hikvision and Dahua both use Intel Corp, Nvidia Corp, Ambarella Inc, Western Digital and Seagate Technology as suppliers.\n\nThe impact of the blacklisting on the Chinese companies would be \u201cdevastating\u201d, he said.\n\nSENSETIME GROUP LTD\n\nIncorporated in 2014 after receiving investment from IDG Capital, SenseTime is one of the fastest growing AI startups in China.\n\nDual-based in Beijing and Hong Kong, SenseTime develops applications for facial recognition, video analysis and other areas including autonomous driving.\n\nIts technology employs AI to identify individuals and analyze those identities using cameras, and has been used by Chinese authorities to track and capture suspects in public spaces such as airports and festivals.\n\nIts $620 million fundraising in May last year valued the firm at more than $4.5 billion. Fidelity International, Hopu Capital, Silver Lake, and Tiger Global led the financing.\n\nThe firm has also received funding from e-commerce firms Alibaba and Suning.Com Co Ltd, Singapore state fund Temasek Holding Ltd, state-backed fund Sailing Capital and U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.\n\nSenseTime counts China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security and local heavyweights such as China Mobile, HNA Group and Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] as its major clients.\n\nIts facial recognition unlocking and related technologies are offered to smartphone brands OPPO and Vivo.\n\nThe firm said in February it will create an alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to advance research into AI.\n\nMEGVII TECHNOLOGY LTD\n\nFounded in 2011 by Chief Executive Yin Qi and two friends from Tsinghua University, the company is preparing an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong to raise at least $500 million.\n\nWidely known for facial recognition platform Face++, Megvii will become the first Chinese AI firm to go public if the deal goes ahead.\n\nThe company provides facial recognition and other AI technology to governments and companies including Alibaba, Ant Financial, Lenovo Group Ltd and Huawei.\n\nIts $750 million fundraising in May 2018 valued the firm at slightly over $4 billion.\n\nIt raised funds from Alibaba, Ant Financial, Foxconn Technology, Bank of China Group Investment (BOCGI) Ltd, the state bank\u2019s private equity arm, Macquarie Group, and ICBC Asset Management (Global) Co.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the world\u2019s biggest sovereign wealth funds, also took part in a fund raising.\n\nIFLYTEK CO LTD\n\nFounded in 1999, the speech recognition firm is a national champion in voice-related AI.\n\nState-owned China Mobile is iFlytek\u2019s largest shareholder with a 12.85% stake, according to its 2018 annual report.\n\nThe MIT last year announced a five-year agreement with IFlytek under which the Chinese firm would help underwrite three research projects at the university\u2019s renowned Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).\n\nThe projects relate to AI in health care, speech recognition, and what CSAIL described in its announcement as creating \u201cmore human-like AI\u201d.\n\nA 2016 government procurement announcement named an iFlytek subsidiary as the sole supplier of 25 \u201cvoiceprint\u201d collection systems to police in Kashgar, a city in Xinjiang, Reuters reported earlier.\n\nAnother iFlytek unit signed a deal with Xinjiang\u2019s prison administration bureau.\n\nZHEJIANG DAHUA TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe video surveillance equipment maker went public in 2008 and is among five firms which had been barred from selling to U.S. government agencies, along with Hikvision.\n\nThe company, which claims to be the world\u2019s second largest surveillance provider, says its products and services are applied over 180 countries and regions.\n\nIts products have been used in events such as the Rio Olympics, the G20 Hangzhou Summit, and a subway project in Brazil.\n\nXIAMEN MEIYA PICO INFORMATION CO\n\nEstablished in 1999, the company is a data recovery expert and says it provides products and services for law enforcement and government agencies all over the world.\n\nIts digital forensics services include extracting evidence from digital media such as computers, mobile phones and data storage cards.\n\nThe company says it provided security support for events such as the Beijing Olympic Games, Guangzhou Asian Games and Shanghai World Expo.\n\nYITU TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe facial recognition technology firm was founded in 2012 and raised funds from investors including Sequoia Capital, Jack Ma\u2019s private equity fund Yunfeng Capital, and Hillhouse Capital Group.\n\nThe company claims its facial recognition platform is capable of identifying over 1 billion faces within one second.\n\nIt said in 2015 its technology is used at China Merchants Bank\u2019s 1,500 outlets. It worked with Alibaba Cloud to build a cloud platform for smart transportation management.", "description": "The U.S. government expanded its trade blacklist on Monday to include some of China's top artificial intelligence (AI) startups over Beijing's treatment of Muslim minorities.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438420016&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970QU", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
