Some of those brands have flourished within LVMH, while others haven\u2019t.\n\nTiffany, which is struggling through years of stagnant sales, is the biggest acquisition target of his career. If Tiffany falters inside LVMH, it would be difficult to hide: The jeweler would immediately be one of the French company\u2019s biggest brands alongside heavyweights such as Louis Vuitton, Dior and Hennessy.\n\nAs one of the four biggest global jewelry companies, Tiffany\u2019s annual revenue is around $4 billion and it has more than 300 stores in over 25 countries around the world. LVMH\u2019s offer values the company at around $14.5 billion; that would make it Mr. Arnault\u2019s biggest deal, topping the \u20ac12 billion ($13.2 billion) he paid to unite Dior with LVMH in 2017.\n\nOn Monday, LVMH and Tiffany confirmed that the French conglomerate made an offer for the jeweler earlier this month. Tiffany said there are no discussions ongoing as it reviews LVMH\u2019s offer.\n\nIf LVMH and Tiffany reach a deal, Mr. Arnault faces the challenge of rejuvenating a company whose strategy and management have been in upheaval in recent years. Critics said Tiffany was selling too many inexpensive items, diluting the brand\u2019s luxury cachet. Others said its baubles were fusty, relying too much on designs dating from the 1960s.\n\nThe company sought to modernize its image by hiring Lady Gaga for ad campaigns and taking out its first Super Bowl ad in 2017. Tiffany pushed out its chief executive, a former LVMH executive, in 2017 and hired another former LVMH executive to replace him.\n\nThis year, a decline in foreign tourists to the U.S., one of Tiffany\u2019s main customer groups, has pushed down sales.\n\nDespite these problems, Tiffany remains one of the most well-known names in the luxury business, thanks in part to Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s, the novella that inspired the movie starring Audrey Hepburn.\n\n\u201cThey have this incredible claim with the Hepburn story,\u201d said Concetta Lanciaux, a luxury consultant who worked for decades at LVMH with Mr. Arnault. \u201cThe more time goes by, the more it\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\nThat was likely another draw for Mr. Arnault, who has said that he realized the value of an instantly-recognizable name when a New York City taxi driver told him in the 1970s: \u201cI don\u2019t know the French president, but I know Christian Dior. \u201d\n\nDior became the company Mr. Arnault would use to build up a portfolio of dozens of luxury brands.\n\nWhen Mr. Arnault took control of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton in 1989, he began accumulating smaller brands: Celine in 1996, Sephora in 1997, Fendi in 2001, Bulgari in 2011, among others. None of those deals exceeded $1 billion, but they have become some of LVMH\u2019s most successful brands.\n\nSome of Mr. Arnault\u2019s least successful deals involved U.S. brands. LVMH sold Donna Karan in 2016 after it couldn\u2019t turn around the money-losing fashion label. The conglomerate has absorbed losses at Marc Jacobs for years.\n\nThrough the decades, Mr. Arnault has sought to expand LVMH\u2019s watch and jewelry division, which accounted for just 8.5% of the company\u2019s total revenue of \u20ac48 billion last year. Few jewelry companies other than Tiffany would have the size to move the needle for the French conglomerate.\n\nTiffany would fit nicely into LVMH\u2019s portfolio of companies, analysts say. Its products tend to be less expensive than those of other jewelry brands in the LVMH stable, such as Bulgari. That would prevent the brands from cannibalizing each other\u2019s customers.\n\nTiffany has its own diamond-finishing facilities, which are a likely draw for Mr. Arnault who has long favored his brands taking control of their production.\n\nTiffany would benefit by following LVMH\u2019s playbook for acquisitions, analysts say. The brand\u2019s creative functions would be kept largely autonomous, but LVMH would integrate some of the brand\u2019s back-office jobs such as finance and logistics. Tiffany could also draw on the expertise of LVMH\u2019s digital strategy group, an in-house consulting team that provides advice to the conglomerate\u2019s dozens of brands.\n\n\u201cTiffany would become a better company and stronger competitor under the ownership of LVMH,\u201d said RBC analyst Rogerio Fujimori.\n\n\u2014Suzanne Kapner contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Matthew Dalton at Matthew.Dalton@wsj.com", "description": "In targeting Tiffany, French billionaire Bernard Arnault, faces rejuvenating a company whose strategy and management have been in upheaval.", "authors": ["Matthew Dalton", "Matthew.Dalton Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-121499/social", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
