And, unwilling to just acknowledge this was a good day for America,\" she told Kilmeade.\n\nThe Post faced an avalanche of criticism Sunday for initially including the phrase \"austere religious scholar\" in the paper's headline of a story on al-Baghdadi's death. A separate column slammed President Trump for calling the deceased terrorist a \"coward.\"\n\nRAID IN PHOTOS: IMAGES FROM THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES MISSION THAT KILLED AL-BAGHDADI\n\nHemingway told Kilmeade that it \"wasn't just the headline\" that was appalling, but that the \"entire article was very gentle towards this man who was a serial rapist, genocidal murderer, someone who had killed so many Americans and other people who opposed his political and religious agenda.\"\n\n\"It is not necessary that you do this type of coverage, and yet they weren't the only ones that did it,\" she noted.\n\nSTEVE HILTON: KILLING OF AL-BAGHDADI 'IS A VINDICATION' OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SYRIA STRATEGY\n\nCNN ran a piece titled \u201cThe 41 most shocking lines from Donald Trump\u2019s Baghdadi announcement.\u201d\n\nA New York Times news story said the raid \u201coccurred largely in spite of, and not because of, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions.\u201d\n\nNate Silver, the editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight, took to Twitter to slam the reaction from liberals.\n\n\"It['s] really amazing how many Libs can't even permit Trump to have *one good day* (nobody will remember this stuff by Tuesday) after US forces kill perhaps the world's most wanted terrorist,\" Silver wrote.\n\n\"This is a good day for President Trump. It can help him in his reelection when he points to what should have been favorable news coverage,\" said Hemingway.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe told Kilmeade that the successful operation also \"refutes or complicates the narrative that people were setting\" about the president's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.\n\n\"Realizing that we can go after ISIS, even with that withdrawal, really made a lot of people look foolish for their apocalyptic predictions,\" she said. \"And, it also hurts their impeachment efforts, which is what they really want to do.\"\n\nFox News' Howard Kurtz contributed to this report.", "description": "The media's reaction to the death of ISIS leader\u00a0Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was \"outrageous\" and partisan,\u00a0Fox News contributor Mollie Hemingway said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/MOLLIE-CROP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
