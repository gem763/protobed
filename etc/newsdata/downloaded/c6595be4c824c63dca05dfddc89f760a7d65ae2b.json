I didn\u2019t really know anything about it,\u201d Jade said.\n\n\"When she started pre-school she noticed and she asked 'why have I got a point chest and the other kids haven\u2019t?'\n\n(Image: Lincolnshire live WS)\n\n\u201cShe has got speech delay as well and doesn\u2019t like speaking in front of people because of that.\n\n\"Then to have her thinking she is even more different to the other kids because of her chest \u2013 it\u2019s upsetting.\n\n\"She is really aware because of the other kids. She does ask why she has a pointy chest.\"\n\nInitially, the mum-of-two was told there was nothing wrong with her little girl.\n\nHowever, she decided to do some research of her own and got a second opinion from a specialist in Oxford, where she was told the condition can be cured with a corrective brace.\n\n(Image: Lincolnshire live WS)\n\nResults can be seen from anything from six months to a couple of years - and the mum has been reassured after speaking to other parents who have had the treatment for the same condition as Lotty\u2019s.\n\nUnfortunately, for the family the cost of the procedure isn\u2019t available on the NHS, leading to the mum launching an appeal to help raise the money needed.\n\nThe mum said: \u201cShe [Lotty] is asking when she is going to get her superhero brace.\"\n\n\"I want to do it so she is the same as the other kids and doesn\u2019t have to be self-conscious and feel different to the other children,\u201d the mum, who works as a teaching assistant, she added.\n\n\"It will grow as she gets older and we don\u2019t know how big it will get.\u201d\n\nA GoFundMe has been set up to raise the \u00a31,500 needed for the brace and the \u00a3200 for the appointment.\n\nMore information about how you can donate can be found here.", "description": "Jade Teare\u2019s daughter, Lotty, 4, has a condition called Pectus Carinatum but a procedure to cure it is not available on the NHS", "authors": ["Ashley Franklin", "Image", "Lincolnshire Live Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20727103.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RIP-Girls-heartbreaking-question-to-mum-because-she-looks-different-to-other-children.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
