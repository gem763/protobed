However, unlike current incubators the artificial womb would be similar to biological conditions, with the baby surrounded by fluids and receiving oxygen and nutrients through an artificial placenta that will connect to their umbilical cord.\n\nGuid Oei, a professor at the Dutch university and gynaecologist at the nearby Maxima medical centre, said current approaches are problematic as premature babies do not yet have fully developed lungs or intestines \u2013 meaning that attempts to deliver oxygen or nutrients directly to such organs can result in damage.\n\nAn artificial womb, Oei said, would be a gamechanger.\n\n\u201cWhen we put the lungs back under water then they can develop, they can mature, but the baby will receive the oxygen by the umbilical cord, just like in the natural womb,\u201d he said.\n\nThe team hope to have a working prototype of their artificial womb ready for use in clinics within five years \u2013 meaning it could be a world first. The funding has come from the Horizon 2020 EU programme.\n\nAccording to e from the charity Tommy\u2019s, babies born before 22 weeks have almost no chance of survival, while at 22 weeks the chance is only around 10%. But just two weeks later, survival rates rise to about 60%. Oei said that at present, about 1 million babies worldwide die due to prematurity, while those that survive are at risk of a range of disabilities.\n\nArtificial womb for premature babies successful in animal trials Read more\n\nIn 2017 researchers at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia demonstrated that an artificial womb, known as the \u201cbiobag\u201d, could keep alive lambs that were born at the equivalent of 23 weeks of a human pregnancy. Over the weeks they were in the biobags, the lambs continued to develop, turning from bald to fluffy in the process. After being removed from the biobags, the lambs grew up normally.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A lamb (L) at 107 days of gestation (on the fourth day of support) inside the biobag developed in Philadelphia and the same lamb on the 28th day of support.

Is it possible to turn off the artificial womb, and in what circumstances?\u201d she said, adding that there are also questions about how such a gestation might be viewed by society, particularly if it becomes an alternative to a \u201cnatural\u201d pregnancy.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the legal and ethical issues emerging from the technology must be talked about now, in advance of the artificial womb becoming a reality,\u201d she said.", "description": "Model from Eindhoven University will surround baby with fluid and deliver oxygen and nutrients via umbilical cord", "authors": ["Nicola Davis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fdb0bbb0e072d90b2fc18285dba9f84d5499cfb/0_377_6672_4003/master/6672.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0014dfa3a02b517eff161c0f3c088748", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
