In a news release on Sunday, the FBI announced that federal crime analysts believe all of his confessions are credible, and officials have been able to verify 50 confessions so far.\n\nInvestigators also provided new information and details about five cases in Florida, Arkansas, Kentucky, Nevada and Louisiana.\n\nThe 79-year-old Little is serving multiple life sentences in California. He says he strangled his 93 victims, nearly all of them women.\n\nSome of his victims were on the margins of society. Many were originally deemed overdoses, or attributed to accidental or undetermined causes. Some bodies were never found.\n\nThe FBI last year released a series of portraits of Little's victims, which he drew in prison More\n\nThe FBI provided 30 drawings of some of his victims - color portraits that were drawn by Little himself in prison. They are haunting portraits, mostly of black women.\n\nThe agency also provided videos taken during prison interviews with Little. He described how he spoke about a woman he strangled in 1993 - and how he rolled her down a slope on a desolate road.\n\n\"I heard a secondary road noise and that meant she was still rolling,\" he said.\n\nIn another video, he described a victim in New Orleans. \"She was pretty. Light colored, honey brown skin,\" he said with a small smile. \"She was tall for a woman. Beautiful shape. And, uh, friendly.\"\n\nIt was 1982, and they met in a club. She left with him in his Lincoln, and they parked by a bayou.\n\n\"That's the only one that I ever killed by drowning,\" he said.\n\nInvestigators around the country are still trying to piece together his confessions with unidentified remains and unsolved cases from decades past. In August , he pleaded guilty to murdering four women in Ohio. He was convicted in California of three slayings in 2013 and pleaded guilty to another killing last year in Texas.\n\nLittle, who often went by the name Samuel McDowell, grew up with his grandmother in Lorain, Ohio. He was described by investigators as a transient and former boxer who traveled the country preying on drug addicts, troubled women and others.\n\nAuthorities in Knox County, Tennessee, said Monday that a woman named Martha Cunningham was likely a victim of Little's.\n\nThe Knoxville News Sentinel reported in December that a cold case investigator with the Knox County Sheriff's Office had identified the victim who Little called \"Martha.\" The Knoxville mother's body was found in a wooded area in eastern Knox County in 1975.\n\nCunningham's body was found by a pair of hunters on the afternoon of Jan. 18, 1975. She was bruised and nude from the waist down; her pantyhose and girdle bunched around her knees. Her purse and some of her jewelry were missing. Her body appeared to have been dragged into the woods and dumped behind a pine tree, authorities said at the time.\n\nIn 2014 Little, 74, shouted out in court during his sentencing hearing that he didn't commit the killings Credit: Nick Ut/ AP More", "description": "The inmate who claims to have killed more than 90 women across the country is now considered to be the deadliest\u00a0serial\u00a0killer in US\u00a0history, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said.
