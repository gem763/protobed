The fifth set had the two men going toe-to-toe in one lung-busting rally after another, but Nadal played with a bit more tenacity on the points that mattered most. In the face of Medvedev\u2019s gutsy, heroic effort, Nadal confirmed his standing as one of the most beastly players in the history of men\u2019s tennis.\n\nBy winning the final grand-slam tournament of the season, Nadal brought himself within one title of Roger Federer\u2019s record for the most slams ever won by a male player. Barring a catastrophic injury along the lines of a ruptured Achilles tendon or torn ACL, Nadal seems more likely to surpass his great rival in that category. He\u2019s almost five years younger, and while Federer\u2019s longevity in tennis is approximate to Tom Brady\u2019s in football, Federer will likely retire before Nadal, meaning that Nadal will have more opportunities to collect grand-slam hardware. Just as important, Nadal is still the best clay-court player in the world by an almost unfathomable margin. He has won the past three French Opens without once being pushed to five sets. He will remain the prohibitive favorite at that tournament until another player proves a worthy adversary.\n\nWhether Nadal chooses to let his pursuit of the all-time grand-slam singles title record define his career\u2014whether it\u2019s even a distinction he cares deeply about\u2014he leaves New York looking like the best player in the world and as hungry for success and enthusiastic about the game as he was when he won his maiden slam as a teenager in 2005. Ten years ago, Nadal seemed unlikely to still be one of the best players in the world at 33, a relatively advanced age in tennis. During his first decade on the professional tour, he was plagued by knee tendinitis and had a tendency to succumb to other ailments, such as an abdominal injury at the 2009 U.S. Open. It was widely assumed that Nadal would have a stellar but short career, that his body would break down and force him to retire before he had the opportunity to rewrite the record books. But the emphasis Nadal places on ending points as early as possible, which allows him to avoid long rallies, has helped preserve his body. Over the past two seasons, he\u2019s morphed from an injury-addled grinder into the most consistent player on the tour, advancing to at least the semifinals at the past seven grand slams\u2014a mark that neither Federer nor Novak Djokovic, another paragon of consistency, has matched.\n\nIn Medvedev, Nadal faced one of the few players with the requisite defensive skills and physical endurance to transform any match into an endless baseline slugfest. Medvedev has been the hottest and most interesting player on the men\u2019s tour this summer. He made the finals in each of the three hard-court tournaments he played prior to the U.S. Open, capping that endurance-testing run with a title at the prestigious Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati. He arrived in New York battle-tested and bruised, and quickly assumed the role of tournament antihero, displaying a brand of feisty, crowd-baiting behavior that evoked memories of proud bad boys such as Jimmy Connors and Ilie N\u0103stase.", "description": "After a grueling and dramatic final against tournament antihero Daniil Medvedev, the Spaniard inched closer to the men\u2019s grand-slam record.", "authors": ["Kevin Craft"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19251799358959/facebook.jpg?1568044737", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
