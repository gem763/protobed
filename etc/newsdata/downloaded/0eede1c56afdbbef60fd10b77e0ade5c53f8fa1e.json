After Democrats called for the report to be made public, it was declassified around 10:30 p.m. \u2014 though it will not be released to the public until at least Thursday morning.\n\n#Breaking: Two sources confirm to CNN that the whistleblower's report concerning @realDonaldTrump\u2019s phone conversations with the Ukrainian president, has been declassified. However, the report will not be released at least until Thursday morning.\n\n\n\n\u2014@DanaBashCNN reports https://t.co/G9ljLFP2fc \u2014 Josh Campbell (@joshscampbell) September 26, 2019\n\nStill, reporting provides a decent public understanding for what the complaint will contain: Not only did the whistle-blower flag Trump\u2019s call requesting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, they were reportedly concerned with how the White House responded to Trump\u2019s solicitation. According to the New York Times, the whistle-blower \u201cidentified multiple White House officials as witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate the complaint.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Times, Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, interviewed witnesses in the administration, concluding that \u201cthere was reason to believe that the president might have illegally solicited a foreign campaign contribution \u2014 and that his potential misconduct created a national security risk.\u201d\n\nTo add to the convoluted nature of Trump\u2019s latest scandal, another memo \u2014 an opinion from the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel on the whistle-blower\u2019s findings \u2014 provides more insight into the whistle-blower report. According to two sources who read the memo, the whistle-blower was concerned that Trump \u201cabused his authority or acted unlawfully in connection with foreign diplomacy,\u201d though the intelligence officer heard about the call secondhand. The memo also suggests that the whistle-blower\u2019s report goes beyond the details of the limited transcript released on Wednesday \u2014 a determination shared by House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who called the complaint \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and \u201cvery credible.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also previewed more revelations from the soon-to-be-published report: \u201cAll I\u2019ll tell you is this. Two things: Number one, having read the documents in there, I\u2019m even more worried about what happened than when I read the memorandum of the conversation. There are so many facts that have to be examined. It\u2019s very troubling.\u201d", "description": "Congress has the whistle-blower\u2019s report on Trump\u2019s Ukraine call that led to an impeachment inquiry, though the public won\u2019t see it until at least Thursday morning.
