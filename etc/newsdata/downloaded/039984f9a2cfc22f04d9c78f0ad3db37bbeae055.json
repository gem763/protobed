(AP) - Russell Wilson threw for 240 yards a touchdown, Jadeveon Clowney returned an interception for a touchdown and the Seattle Seahawks beat the Arizona Cardinals 27-10 on Sunday.\n\nThe Seahawks (3-1) scored two touchdowns by early in the second quarter, one on Clowney\u2019s spectacular 27-yard interception return and another on a 9-yard pass from Wilson to tight end Will Dissly.\n\nAfter that, Seattle controlled the game\u2019s pace with Chris Carson, who ran for 104 yards on 22 carries. The Seahawks also leaned on their defense, which forced Cardinals rookie quarterback Kyler Murray into another up-and-down day.\n\nArizona\u2019s problems were a familiar story. The Cardinals (0-3-1) moved the ball fairly well in the first half, but couldn\u2019t convert that success into touchdowns. To make matters worse, Zane Gonzalez missed two field goal attempts from 43 and 48 yards and the Seahawks led 20-3 at halftime.\n\nMurray\u2019s introduction to the NFL continues to be a mixed bag.\n\nOn the Cardinals\u2018 second drive, he tried to throw a screen pass to David Johnson, but the 6-foot-5, 255-pound Clowney shed a block and jumped into the air, snatching the ball before sprinting for a 27-yard touchdown. It gave the Seahawks a 10-0 lead.\n\nIt was Clowney\u2019s first career interception and third career touchdown. The Seahawks acquired the standout defensive end in a trade with the Houston Texans just before the season started.\n\nMurray scored his first career rushing touchdown with a 9-yard run with 10:21 left in the fourth quarter to pull the Cardinals within 20-10. The No. 1 overall pick finished 22 of 32 passing for 241 yards and one interception. David Johnson had eight catches for 99 yards.\n\nSeattle\u2019s C.J. Prosise scored on a 9-yard run with 2:13 left in the fourth quarter to put the game out of reach.\n\nNO. 2 IN CATCHES\n\nArizona\u2019s Larry Fitzgerald caught five passes for 47 yards, pushing him past Tony Gonzalez for the No. 2 on the NFL\u2019s all-time career receptions list. Fitzgerald has 1,326 career catches.\n\nNo. 1 on the list is Jerry Rice, who had 1,549.\n\nTIGHT END, AGAIN\n\nDissly\u2019s touchdown catch continued a troubling trend for Arizona\u2019s defense.\n\nThe Cardinals have given up six touchdowns to opposing tight ends this season. Dissly finished with a team-high seven catches for 57 yards.\n\nSEATTLE LOVES THE DESERT\n\nThe Seahawks continued their dominance inside State Farm Stadium with another win. Seattle hasn\u2019t lost in Glendale since 2012, with a 6-0-1 record during that span, including a 2016 tie.\n\nPALMER HONORED\n\nFormer Arizona quarterback Carson Palmer was inducted into the franchise Ring of Honor during a halftime ceremony.\n\nThe 39-year-old Palmer was the team\u2019s starter for five seasons from 2013 to 2017. He led the team to a 13-3 record and the NFC Championship game in 2015. The Cardinals had an 8-1 record in 2014 before Palmer suffered a season-ending knee injury.\n\nINJURIES\n\nCardinals: DE Zach Allen (shoulder) hurt his shoulder in the second quarter and didn\u2019t return. \u2026 LB Dennis Gardeck (ankle) left early in the fourth quarter.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSeahawks: Seattle hosts the Los Angeles Rams on Thursday night.\n\nCardinals: Arizona plays its second road game of the season when it travels to face Cincinnati next weekend.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Russell Wilson threw for 240 yards a touchdown, Jadeveon Clowney returned an interception for a touchdown and the Seattle Seahawks beat the Arizona Cardinals 27-10 on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Brandt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/aptopix_seahawks_cardinals_football_97528_c0-166-3966-2478_s1770x1032.jpg?e1865ca441e648d66f242f8192435004d946b0d8", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
