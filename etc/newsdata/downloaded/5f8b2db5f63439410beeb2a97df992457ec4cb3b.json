I wasn\u2019t sleeping as well as I should have been.\n\n\u201cOccasionally, I was a little bit wobbly. And I should have put two and two together, and I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Get back into the groove\u2019 \u2013\n\nSanders has pushed back after mentioning that he might reduce his workload.\n\n\u201cI misspoke the other day,\u201d he told NBC on Wednesday. \u201cThe media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign, I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings.\u201d\n\nHe also dismissed criticism that his team had been slow to release news of the heart attack, which he suffered on October 1 at a campaign event in Nevada.\n\n\u201cThe first thing that we\u2019re trying to do is understand what\u2019s going on and not run to The New York Times and have to report every 15 minutes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is not a baseball game. So I think we acted absolutely appropriately.\u201d\n\nHe was released from the hospital after three days and is due to join rival candidates on Tuesday for a grueling TV debate before next weekend holding a \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally in New York.\n\nSanders is the oldest candidate vying to lead the Democrats. Biden is 76 and Warren is 70, while Trump is 73.\n\nSanders said he would \u201cfight even harder\u201d to introduce universal health care after his heart attack.\n\nHis health has generally been good and it has been Biden who has had to bat away questions about his stamina and mental sharpness.\n\nA self-described Democratic socialist, Sanders laid out his radical personal vision to ABC, saying that \u201cbusiness as usual, and doing it the old-fashioned way, is not good enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we need is, in fact, I don\u2019t want to get people too nervous, we need a political revolution.\n\n\u201cI am, I believe, the only candidate who\u2019s going to say to the ruling class of this country, the corporate elite, enough with your greed and with your corruption. We need real change in this country.\u201d\n\nSanders pushed Hillary Clinton to the wire in 2016, but ultimately lost the race to become the Democratic nominee.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 US Senator Bernie Sanders may be 78 and recovering from a heart attack, but he is determined to prove he has lost none of his", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/2537df_bernie-sanders-has-vowed-bounce-minor-heart-attack-us-presidential-hopeful-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
