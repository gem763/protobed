While in mid-September, the agency downgraded Litecoin and Cardano and upgraded Monero, it now upgraded Litecoin and Cardano and downgraded Monero.\n\nThe Cryptoverse is full of twists and turns, and grades will follow each coin\u2019s performance. Overall, September 2019 wasn\u2019t the best of months for coins. Nonetheless, while both Litecoin and Cardano saw their ratings drop from \u201cC+\u201d to \u201cC\u201d two weeks ago, they are now back to \u201cC+\u201d. Both of their risk/reward and technology/adoption grades remain the same (\u201cD\u201d and \u201cB+\u201d for Litecoin; \u201cD-\u201c and \u201cB+\u201d for Cardano). This comes after LTC price saw a 12.07% drop in September, while Cardano dropped 13.02%.\n\nThat\u2019s not all: the two coins are joined by IOTA, which was also upgraded to \u201cC+\u201d, but also Stellar which went from \u201cC-\u201c to \u201cC\u201d. IOTA has a low investment risk/reward grade of E+, with the former rated \u201cweak\u201d and the latter \u201cvery weak.\u201d It has an \u201cA-\u201c in technology/adoption however, rated excellent and good, respectively. Stellar\u2019s investment risk/reward grade is the same, but it has \u201cB+\u201d in technology/adoption, which rated \u201cexcellent\u201d and \u201cgood.\u201d September wasn\u2019t bad for IOTA, as it was among the green coins, having appreciated 11.26%, while Stellar dropped 2.64%.\n\nOn the other hand, Monero, which dropped 15.5% last month, was downgraded from \u201cC+\u201d to \u201cC\u201d. Its risk and reward have been rated \u201cweak\u201d again, but now downgraded from \u201cD+\u201d to \u201cD\u201d. The technology/adoption grade remains \u201cB\u201d/\u201dgood.\u201d\n\nLitecoin and Cardano are back in the top coins by rating category, occupying the 3rd and the 5th spot respectively. IOTA is on the 6th spot, Stellar on the 10th, while Monero is in the 11th this time around.\n\nTop 10 coins by their rating:\n\nSource: Weiss Crypto Ratings\n\nWeiss Crypto Ratings gives cryptocurrencies A to F grades, while a plus or minus sign indicates the upper third or lower third of a grade range, respectively. The agency advises to \"bear in mind that the Weiss Crypto Ratings reflect not only long-term, relatively stable factors such as technology and adoption, but also short-term, volatile factors such as investment risk and reward. Therefore, they can change with some frequency\".", "description": "There has been an interesting reversal in the cryptocurrency grades given by Weiss Crypto Ratings, the financial ratings agency, in this month of many reversals.
