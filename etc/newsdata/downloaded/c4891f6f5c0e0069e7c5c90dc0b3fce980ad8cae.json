The political scientist, founder of the Eurasia Group consultancy, and PBS host has lately been telling everybody about what he calls the GZero World, in which post\u2013World War II institutions are rapidly losing influence. We caught up with Bremmer, 49, to talk about the geopolitical unwinding that has massive implications for investors. An edited version of our conversation follows.\n\nBarron\u2019s: You\u2019ve written a lot about the geopolitical recession, which isn\u2019t an economic term.\n\nBremmer: Geopolitics, like economics, are cyclical. People don\u2019t recognize that because geopolitical cycles are a lot longer. We had a good run of U.S.-led global institutions [like the G-7, the seven largest advance economies], reflecting a new order after World War II. Now they\u2019re unwinding. We\u2019re entering an interregnum where the institutions increasingly don\u2019t work. We need to build new ones.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nIt\u2019s extraordinary when you have Western-led global institutions, but economic, political, and even military power increasingly residing outside the trans-Atlantic. The U.S. can talk about a pivot to Asia, but it\u2019s really hard for the global architecture to do this. It\u2019s hard to get troops out of the Middle East. It\u2019s hard to compromise with the Chinese, who have very different institutions and values and norms. The U.S. foreign-policy establishment once believed that as China became wealthier, it would align more with the U.S., or fail. That was just wrong. In the past three years, the biggest change was created not by President Donald Trump in the U.S. but by President Xi Jinping in China, with his anticorruption program, consolidation of power, end to term limits, the Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, and the AI 2030 and Made in China 2025 policies. This is world-changing stuff.\n\nAre there other reasons?\n\nA growing inability of Western governments to perform for their populations. There\u2019s extraordinary division with the rise of populism. Other countries, like Russia, are looking to exploit it and make it worse, and China is trying to move into the space created when the West isn\u2019t doing much.\n\n\u201c [Europeans are] a transmission belt for all the instability from Africa and the Middle East. \u201d \u2014Ian Bremmer\n\nFinally, technology increasingly doesn\u2019t serve the purposes of liberal democracies. It has moved from undermining authoritarian states to supporting them, as the data revolution [enables] surveillance data and social media. These things make the U.S. weaker and more divided, and make China and other authoritarian states stronger. That\u2019s exactly the opposite from what technological advances achieved 10 years ago.\n\nThe United Nations secretary general recently observed that the world is splitting into two camps\u2014the U.S. and China.\n\nIt\u2019s more West and China-plus. When you have two groups of investors with such dramatically different views of the world, it creates a lot more volatility and risk. Right after the 2008 crisis, a number of Chinese said, \u201cMaybe [the U.S.] economic model doesn\u2019t really work; maybe we can move away from the dollar.\u201d Very quickly they were disabused. It\u2019s different now: Asians think the U.S. is in very serious, inevitable decline; that Trump is driving America off a cliff; and that the Asians are the ones doing long-term strategy. They\u2019re also much more resistant to the kind of populism seen in so many of the democracies in the West.\n\nDo you agree?\n\nNot completely. I do think that U.S. influence and power is in very serious\u2014and structural\u2014decline. And Trump is not helping, to put it mildly. However, the U.S. is not in decline as a country. Look at the biggest objective transformations of the past 10 or 20 years\u2014the energy revolution, the rise of extraordinary technologically and data-empowered companies that are functional monopolies. These are U.S., not Western trends. Americans aren\u2019t experiencing the geopolitical recession the way our allies do, so we\u2019re not incentivized to do much about it.\n\nWhat countries are most affected by the geopolitical recession?\n\nTurkey is massively affected, as America and NATO\u2019s consistent, strong global-policeman role [is diminished]. Another group is the countries under the American security umbrella in Asia, which don\u2019t know how to balance China\u2019s economic rise: Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam. Then you have countries in Africa, which have been accommodated by the Chinese model and Chinese money.\n\nEuropeans are much, much more affected than the Americans\u2014they\u2019re a transmission belt for all the instability from Africa and the Middle East. Russia is able to do much more in terms of traditional espionage, political influence, and asymmetrical warfare on the ground in Europe, because its in its backyard.\n\nOne more point. The two countries that could best respond to a geopolitical recession are the ones that have benefited most by it: China because it represents an opportunity, and America because we\u2019re insulated. We\u2019re buggered. I\u2019m sorry, you were saying?\n\nHow does this lead to a market view?\n\nOne, this is still pretty bullish for U.S. markets. Two, companies that don\u2019t understand these changes are going to get hurt. Apple [ticker: AAPL] doesn\u2019t get this. Its model is building the best possible consumer electronics with some privacy and data security. That\u2019s just not going to work in China. Amazon.com [AMZN] has a much smarter model. It wants to work with the U.S. government. Its second headquarters, just outside Washington, D.C., will get a lot of big contracts, and it will be part of the infrastructure of the U.S. based Internet of Things.\n\nWho wins the U.S. presidential election?\n\nI don\u2019t know. The impeachment issue is serious. There\u2019s a low but real possibility that, if you keep having significant Republicans functionally turning state\u2019s evidence against the president, you could start to lose some senators. The timing of the Syria [troop pullback] wasn\u2019t great for Trump. If the Republicans do vote in favor of impeachment in the Senate, they\u2019re basically giving up on the presidency in 2020. The bar is high. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a 1% chance. I think it\u2019s 10% to 15%.\n\nWho will be the Democratic nominee?\n\nNot Biden. Now that Warren is the front-runner, there\u2019ll be a lot of money against her. I don\u2019t think all of Biden\u2019s support will go to Warren. A lot will be up for grabs, with more centrist candidates. No question in my mind that any of the Democrats will beat Trump by millions of the popular votes. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to win the election. You\u2019ve got to win these swing states, and Trump has a lot of money and a policy orientation that, for many of them, is very attractive. He\u2019s also a relentless campaigner, and he likes campaigning. But he\u2019s facing the worst set of objective facts around his administration.\n\nWhat happens in the Middle East, as the U.S. steps away from Syria and tries to counter Iranian aggression?\n\nThis has been overstated by a foreign-policy establishment that hates everything about Trump. The Syrian war was lost under Obama. For legitimate reasons, the U.S. didn\u2019t have a strong interest in Syria. We weren\u2019t willing to fight another war there, and that\u2019s why Assad won. Now, the Kurds have sided with Russia and Assad. It may be easier to move toward a U.N.-brokered peace settlement, in Assad\u2019s favor. The Syrian people are getting screwed in all this, but that\u2019s not new. The real concern is that you\u2019ll see more attacks in the region from the Islamic State, maybe some in Europe, and maybe against U.S. assets in the region.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nRegarding Iran, Trump was absolutely unwilling to support the Saudis with strikes, despite the [Iranian] attack that took 50% of their oil off the market. He sent some troops over that the Saudis are paying for, and he started a cyberattack. He doesn\u2019t want a war. What he really wants is direct negotiations with Iran, like with North Korea. He really wants a deal. It doesn\u2019t need to be much more than the one Obama already had with Iran that he pulled out of. [It] will be hard for Trump, because he doesn\u2019t have a team to get the hard diplomacy done that Obama did.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about China and trade.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s even a limited deal. The Chinese haven\u2019t signed anything yet. They basically offered the same thing they offered when U.S. Trade Representative [Robert] Lighthizer walked away a few months ago. The only thing that has changed is that Trump is a little more concerned about the economy and his election\u2014a little more desperate for a deal. The Chinese don\u2019t trust Trump. Xi feels like he has given up a fair amount of political capital already, and hasn\u2019t got anything done. So they\u2019re willing to wait him out, particularly because they see that Trump\u2019s appetite for further escalation with the softening U.S. economy is low. U.S.-China relations are objectively more confrontational today than they were three, six, 12 months ago. That trend will continue.\n\nYour annual Top 10 Risks list won\u2019t be out for a while. What is the biggest short-term risk for global investors?\n\nThe role of the U.S. on the global stage. Historically, when you think about global political risk, you think about rogues, you think about emerging markets, you think about country risk. You don\u2019t think of the U.S. driving global political risk. That\u2019s changing.\n\nThanks, Ian.\n\nWrite to Leslie P.
