REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - A no-deal Brexit is likely if Britain does not seek compromise, French Minister for European Affairs Amelie de Montchalin said on Friday.\n\nAsked whether it was increasingly likely that Britain was heading towards leaving the European Union without securing a withdrawal agreement, de Montchalin said on France Inter radio: \u201cIt is likely\u201d.\n\n\u201cAt this point, if talks do not proceed the way we hope they will, if there is no desire, particularly from the British side, for compromise, then a no-deal is possible,\u201d she added.\n\nDe Montchalin said an agreement was still possible and that talks between the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his British counterpart, Stephen Barclay, on Friday would continue exploring possibilities.\n\n\u201cWe are working on a deal, not any deal and not at any conditions. We will not give in on the principles that we have laid out for two and a half years,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe want peace in Ireland, we want to protect our companies from disloyal competition and we want our future relations (with Britain) to be balanced\u201d, she said.", "description": "A no-deal Brexit is likely if Britain does not seek compromise, French Minister for European Affairs Amelie de Montchalin said on Friday.", "authors": ["Jean-St\u00e9phane Brosse", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439596588&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0HS", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
