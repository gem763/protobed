He has slain swamp kings along the banks of the Potomac. He stood up to Chinese President Xi Jinping, stiffed the mullahs of Iran and walked away from North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. And he utterly humiliated the Great Political Pundits of 2016.\n\nNow come the meteorologists.\n\nSheathed in their nerdy white lab coats and pocket protectors, armed with their little TV weather screen clickers, they are ready for battle against the Great Orange Force of Nature.\n\n\u201cTrump clings to idea Alabama faced big threat from Dorian,\u201d blares The Associated Press headline about the first major hurricane of the Atlantic season.\n\nThe meteorologists declared it a Category 5 on Sept. 1. It was a Category 5 \u2014 until it wasn\u2019t.\n\nMeteorologists are in the business of getting predictions wrong. Why else does anyone watch the weather news \u2014 except for the hilarity of watching them get it wrong day after day after day? They predict sunshine, grab your umbrella.\n\nMeteorologists are so deeply wedded to fake weather predictions that they make the Great Political Pundits of 2016 look like an army of Nostradamuses.\n\nJust when you think it can\u2019t get any more ridiculous, the world of fake news collides with the world of fake weather forecasts. Who could have seen that coming? Certainly not the meteorologists or political pundits.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s great crime here was, as usual, a tweet.\n\n\u201cIn addition to Florida \u2014 South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!\u201d\n\nEvery shred of information included in the president\u2019s tweet came directly from \u2014 that\u2019s right \u2014 meteorologists. The very same meteorologists who then turned viciously against Mr. Trump as soon as their own predictions, as usual, turned into total fantasy.\n\nOne fake forecaster complained about Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet in an email to the AP. \u201cAlabama was never in the five-day cone except for a tiny sliver of the southeast corner of the state at one point.\u201d\n\nSeriously? This is the idiot\u2019s complaint?\n\nIn other words, Alabama was never in the five-day cone except when it was. And how is it that somehow the \u201ctiny sliver of the southeast corner\u201d of Alabama is suddenly no longer \u201cAlabama\u201d?\n\nNo wonder these people dedicate so much of their lives to giving the American people fake weather forecasts.\n\nAnother weather faker complained that since Mr. Trump has such a massive Twitter following \u2014 far larger than even the largest fake weather \u201cforecaster\u201d \u2014 he needs to stick with only the latest fake forecasts.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s going to be a provider of up-to-date information, he needs to be up to date,\u201d the fake forecaster sniveled.\n\nIn other words, leave the fake forecasting to the professional fake forecasters and only pass along the very latest fake forecast that all the professional fake forecasters currently agree upon.\n\nThank God for Donald J. Trump.\n\n\u2022 Contact Charles Hurt at [email protected] or on Twitter @charleshurt.\n\nSign up for Charles Hurt's Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
