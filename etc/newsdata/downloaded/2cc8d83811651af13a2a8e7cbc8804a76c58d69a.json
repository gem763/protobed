The 22-ounce bottle came from a lot distributed in 2018.\n\nBaby powder bottles in other sizes are still available from retailers.\n\nThe recall comes as J&J; is fighting thousands of lawsuits alleging the talc in its iconic baby powder was contaminated with asbestos and gave plaintiffs ovarian cancer or mesothelioma. The company has insisted that tests of its product over 40 years have not found asbestos contamination.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is working with the FDA to investigate how the asbestos got into the single bottle, including whether it was tampered with. J&J; advised consumers to stop using any bottles from the lot, #22318RB.\n\n\u201cAs a safeguard, we\u2019ve pulled all 22-ounce bottles until Johnson & Johnson\u201d finishes investigating, Rite Aid spokesman Chris Savarese said Friday, adding the bottles were put in storage.\n\nA Walmart spokeswoman said it had removed all 22-ounce bottles bearing the same UPC barcode as the recalled lot, but other 22-ounce bottles are still available.\n\nWalmart and Rite Aid noted they set up computer system blocks to prevent customers from buying the product in case any was still on a shelf.\n\nCVS Health said it\u2019s removed all 22-ounce bottles from both its pharmacies and CVS.com.\n\n\u201cThis is a normal protocol we follow out of an abundance of caution and to help prevent customer confusion in our stores,\u201d CVS said in a statement.\n\nIt added that customers who purchased the product from a CVS pharmacy can return it for a refund.\n\nWalgreen\u2019s didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n___\n\nFollow Linda A.
