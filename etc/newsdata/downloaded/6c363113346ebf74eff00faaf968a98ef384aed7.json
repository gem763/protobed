He\u2019ll never have to.\n\nAD\n\n***\n\nTake the vivid moments of this playoff run, put them on loop in your head, then count how many Kendrick\u2019s created. There\u2019s the grand slam at Dodger Stadium on Oct. 9, in the top of the 10th inning of Game 5 of the National League Division Series, pushing the Nationals to their first playoff series win. There are all those doubles \u2014 cracked into right-center, left-center, wherever there\u2019s open grass \u2014 to rev an offense for a few extra weeks. And there was the celebration after Washington advanced to the World Series late last Tuesday night, with the 36-year-old Kendrick clutching the National League Championship Series MVP trophy.\n\n\u201cI feel like being around this long, I wouldn't change anything about the past,\u201d Kendrick said after the Nationals earned their title shot. \u201cBecause this is just \u2026 I mean, it's unbelievable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe helped by doing what he\u2019s always done. He\u2019s hit and kept hitting, driving in four runs across the first two rounds, until the Nationals got to where they\u2019ve never been. He\u2019s in the process of capping a career, 14 years in the game, a life that could have gone in so many other directions. Kendrick wasn\u2019t recruited out of West Nassau High School. He tried out for almost a dozen junior colleges, was cut by two and, when hope was slipping, considered joining the Navy SEALs.\n\nBut Kendrick waited a bit longer, testing fate, until he landed at St. John\u2019s River Community College between Jacksonville and Orlando. He was soon drafted by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the 10th round of the 2002 draft. He would earn a reputation as a \u201cprofessional hitter,\u201d joined the Nationals via trade two summers ago, and would have retired after tearing his right Achilles\u2019 tendon last season. Yet there was one year left on his contract and he wanted to finish it.\n\nNow he\u2019ll play in Game 1 of the World Series against the Astros in Houston on Tuesday night. Now, somehow, Kendrick is a reason the Nationals won a pennant and have a chance at more.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to think about how different things could have gone if he\u2019s never seen,\u201d said Torii Hunter, Kendrick\u2019s longtime friend and former Angels teammate. \u201cBut you have to understand that Howie is who he is, he\u2019s still going, because of everything along the way.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThey called him \u201cSloppy\u201d as a kid, because he still had baby fat and his clothes never quite fit.\n\nHe\u2019d spend afternoons in his grandmother\u2019s driveway, the Florida sun cooking the pavement, tossing rocks into the air before whacking them with a stick. But one day Ruth Woods told him to run on down to the Little League field. Kendrick grew up with her, since his mother was in the army and deployed overseas. He has often credited Woods for his love of baseball, for nudging him into organized games, and for making sure he spent just 18 years in their two-stoplight town.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was all he wanted to play once he got to West Nassau. Richard Pierce, the varsity baseball coach, figures that Kendrick could have starred in football, basketball, maybe even excelled at soccer. One day after practice, Kendrick challenged the school\u2019s best tennis player and held his own. His teammates stopped with Sloppy. He went by Howard and they all wanted to play like him.\n\n\u201cI traveled the country trying to find anyone who would listen,\u201d Pearce said of trying to get Kendrick recruited. \u201cBut they didn't want the little guy.\u201d\n\nKendrick stood 5-foot-7 and weighed no more than 110 pounds. Pearce convinced Lake City, a nearby community college, to come watch him at West Nassau. Kendrick made an early error at shortstop and the coaches left. He later hit the game-winning home run with hardly anyone in the stands.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut St. John\u2019s River saw something when Pearce and Kendrick took a visit. He began his first and only season there in the spring of 2002, before social media could make a star out of nothing, and scouts weren\u2019t showing up. That\u2019s when Kotchman got a phone call he\u2019ll never forget.\n\nIt was Ernie Rosseau, the head coach at Broward College, telling him Kendrick was must-see. Kotchman was the Angels\u2019 area scout and always trusted Rousseau's judgment. So Kotchman went out to St. John\u2019s River, his expectations tempered, and noticed that no other scouts were there St. John\u2019s River was playing a small program from Illinois. That made Kotchman comfortable removing the camera from his bag. Scouts try to hide interest in a specific player, especially when the draft is nearing, but he had exclusive access to Kendrick.\n\n\u201cHe didn't have the travel ball and stuff like that. He didn't have the luxuries that other players have,\u201d Kotchman said of why Kendrick was an unknown. \u201cHe's getting the last laugh.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKotchman was soon sitting with Donnie Rowland, then the Angels\u2019 scouting director, as they watched the Kendrick tape. Rowland had the basic list of questions for Kotchman: Could Kendrick field? He was fine. Could he run? He had average speed. But Rowland couldn\u2019t stop watching a swing that hasn\u2019t changed much in the 17 years since. It was all that mattered \u2014 and still is.\n\n***\n\nThey called him Truck with the Angels, both because he was built like one and had a fascination with big cars.\n\nWhen Hunter got to Anaheim in 2008, after spending nine full seasons with the Minnesota Twins, his locker was next to Kendrick\u2019s. Hunter was eight years older and took Kendrick under his wing. They sat at their stalls for hours, sinking into deep conversation, skipping from baseball to their childhoods to interests away from the park.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn one of their first road trips, Kendrick bought a digital camera and began snapping pictures all over Seattle and San Francisco. He walked right up to homeless people, camera in hand, and asked about their lives. Then he\u2019d step back and take a portrait before showing them on the tiny screen. Hunter says now that he never saw a 24-year-old so comfortable around strangers.\n\n\u201cThe more I learned about him, he starts telling me about how no schools wanted him, how it was really hard to stay confident,\u201d Hunter remembered. \u201cI just kept thinking: This guy could have really fallen through the cracks.\u201d\n\nHunter often stood behind the batting cage before games to watch Kendrick. Most hitters, Hunter explained, get front or back spin with their swing. But not Kendrick. He crushed the ball so hard, and at the perfect spot on the bat, that it knuckled into the field. Hunter only ever saw three players able to make the ball do that, the red seams stuck between rotations, as if it were speeding up and slowing down at the same time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe list is Mark Kotasy, Tony Gwynn and Truck, who almost never made it at all.\n\n***\n\nThey call him Howie now, even if he introduces himself as Howard, because those two syllables are synonymous with this city\u2019s newfound trust in fall.\n\nIt was Kendrick who, way back in spring, paced a lineup down Trea Turner, Juan Soto, Anthony Rendon and Ryan Zimmerman due to injuries. He kept the club floating despite a 19-31 start. Then he put together a career year \u2014 a .344 average, 17 homers, insane production in 370 plate appearances \u2014 that\u2019s carried into the postseason. Kendrick doesn\u2019t like talking about himself and never pretends to. One-on-one interviews are rare and short. The most he\u2019s opened up this season, across eight months at the field, was about his love for Mike Trout and thoughts on Hall of Fame voting.\n\nAD\n\nTeammates respect the low-key approach. He\u2019s the elder on the oldest roster in baseball. Martinez has repeatedly noted Kendrick\u2019s influence on young players such as Soto and Victor Robles. Soto\u2019s locker is right next door, like Kendrick\u2019s was to Hunter\u2019s a decade ago, and that\u2019s how tradition spirals forward. Soto was behind him onstage last Tuesday night, after the Nationals swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS, while a sellout crowd chanted \u201cHo-wie!\u201d through a layer of fireworks smoke.\n\nIt was hard to hear the public address announcer name Kendrick the MVP.
