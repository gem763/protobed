We've talked about it, whether it's this week at some point, the confidence we have in Malcolm (Brown), but then there's also going to be a time we rely on (rookie) Darrell Henderson, and it might end up being this week.\"\n\nNFL Network's Steve Wyche reported that the Rams knew Gurley was sore earlier in the week, but added neither Gurley nor the club expected the pain to last this long.\n\nThough he has been healthy for all five games this season, Gurley has seen his workload cut dramatically thus far in 2019 relative to 2018. He has 42 fewer touches, 307 fewer yards and four fewer touchdowns this season compared to his stats through five games last season.\n\nAfter playing at an MVP level for much of last season, Gurley was slowed by a knee injury at the end of the regular season, missing Weeks 16 and 17 and struggling in the postseason.\n\nIt was reported this offseason that Gurley has an \"arthritic component\" to his left knee, in which he suffered a torn ACL in college.\n\nLinebacker Clay Matthews (broken jaw), linebacker Natrez Patrick (hamstring) and cornerback Aqib Talib (ribs) also missed practice Wednesday. Matthews suffered his injury in last Thursday's loss in Seattle and is expected to miss about four weeks. The Rams will provide updates on the other players as the week progresses.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley missed practice Wednesday, with  coach Sean McVay telling reporters the All-Pro is day to day with a left thigh ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
