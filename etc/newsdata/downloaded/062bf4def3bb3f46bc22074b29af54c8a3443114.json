(GE) ? Yes, that big iconic conglomerate that has been bringing good things to life and was part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from the beginning. After years of great returns and increasing dividends it got thrown under the bus back in 2001 when the music stopped. The price action over the past has gotten my attention so let's check out the charts and indicators.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of GE, below, we can see that prices have made no progress in the past 12 months -- you could have gone long GE in early November around $9 and we are right back there now. This long, mostly sideways price action is like a watch spring that is wound up tight but eventually the tension is unleashed. GE is trading above the rising 50-day moving average line but below the rising 200-day line.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a slight improvement from September and I am impressed that buyers are being more aggressive when the fundamental news on GE has been so bearish. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is poised to cross above the zero line for an outright go long signal.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of GE, below, we can see the movement of prices over the past four years. Prices suffered a big decline but they look like they have stabilized and the slope of the 40-week moving average line has turned positive. Prices are below the 40-week line but a big rally is not needed to get back above the line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line saw its nadir in December and is in much better shape now. The MACD oscillator is only slightly below the zero line.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of GE, below, we can see a potential upside price target around $13.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Maybe the story about GE has not improved all that much but the charts say it is a buy. Consider going long and risking a close below $8.", "description": "Technical analysis and trading strategy on General Electric stock....GE", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "General Electric Is Coming Back The Dead For Halloween", "Here'S How To Play Shares Of The Industrial Conglomerate Right Now.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Ed Ponsi", "Bob Lang", "Gary Berman", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/9e3acd92-390e-11e9-9b32-d505fcdb58b1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
