The Czechs moved on despite losing earlier Monday to NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and Greece.\n\nNFL\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) - The Jacksonville Jaguars have acquired quarterback Josh Dobbs in a trade with Pittsburgh, giving them a backup while Nick Foles recovers from a broken collarbone.\n\nThe Jaguars gave up a fifth-round pick in the 2020 draft for Dobbs, who was in his third season with the Steelers. He was a fourth-round pick in 2017.\n\nHe has played in five career NFL games, completing 6 of 12 passes for 43 yards and an interception.\n\nHe will back up rookie Gardner Minshew, who completed 22 of 25 passes for 275 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception, in his NFL debut Sunday.\n\nFoles broke his left clavicle on the team\u2019s 10th offensive play of the season.

The fans gave him a rousing ovation as he bounded up the steps of the dugout with no apparent effects from the June 9 assassination attempt in a Santo Domingo nightclub.\n\nDominican police say it was a case of mistaken identity.\n\nOrtiz took a microphone on the pitcher\u2019s mound and thanked Red Sox fans for their prayers and support. He then took a seat in the front row of the stands, next to the Boston dugout.\n\nWNBA\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) - The Indiana Fever have fired coach and general manager Pokey Chatman, a day after the team finished with a third straight losing season.\n\nIndiana Vice President of Basketball Operations Tamika Catchings said Monday the Fever are \u201coptimistic about our future as we continue to build on our 20-year legacy as one of the WNBA\u2019s most successful franchises.\u201d\n\nThe team finished the season with three consecutive victories to go 13-21. Indiana more than doubled its win total of six victories from 2018.\n\nChatman took over in 2017 and had a 28-74 record. Chatman had spent the previous six years coaching the Chicago Sky, where she had a 106-98 record.\n\nCOLLEGES\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Southern California athletic director Lynn Swann has resigned after three years on the job at his alma mater.\n\nUSC President Carol Folt announced the decision in a letter Monday.\n\nDave Roberts will serve as interim athletic director. He is a special adviser to Folt, who assumed her position in July.\n\nThe 67-year-old Swann was hired in 2016 despite no significant experience in athletic administration. The Pro Football Hall of Fame receiver spent nine years with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nUSC\u2019s athletic department has faced several setbacks during Swann\u2019s stay, notably involvement in the widespread college admissions scandal and the college basketball corruption scandal.\n\nSwann also soured many USC fans by backing football coach Clay Helton, who was retained after the Trojans went 5-7 last season.\n\nLITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - Former coach Bobby Petrino is apologizing to fans and players in Arkansas seven years after he was fired for misleading officials about his extramarital affair with an athletic department employee that was exposed after the two were involved in a motorcycle crash.\n\nPetrino returned to Arkansas on Monday for the first time since 2012, addressing a packed room for a Little Rock Touchdown Club luncheon. Petrino told the audience he was nervous about the speaking engagement, comparing it to game day.\n\nThen-athletic director Jeff Long fired Petrino in 2012 after the accident during which it was later discovered Petrino was riding with his mistress. That led to revelations that Petrino had hired the woman to a position in the athletic department, and that he had given her $20,000 to buy a new car.\n\nSOCCER\n\nCHICAGO (AP) - Dan Flynn will retire as chief executive officer and secretary general of the U.S. Soccer Federation on Sept. 16.\n\nWhile the search for a successor continues, the USSF said Monday that Brian Remedi will serve as chief administrative officer in addition to chief stakeholder officer.

(AP) - Michigan State University has dropped plans for an outside review to determine how it handled sexual assault complaints against former campus sports doctor Larry Nassar.\n\nThe switch by trustees comes a few months after they voted unanimously to hire a Chicago law firm to investigate and release a report. Trustee Brian Mosallam had pledged to \u201crip off the Band-Aid.\u201d\n\nBut some trustees now believe that a federal investigation has filled the role. Trustee Dianne Byrum also says there was no consensus on the scope of the job.\n\nSome of Nassar\u2019s victims are upset. Sarah Klein calls it a \u201ccomplete betrayal.\u201d\n\nNassar was sentenced to decades in prison for assault and child pornography crimes. The U.S. Education Department last week ordered a $4.5 million fine and many changes at Michigan State.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "INTERNATIONAL BASKETBALL", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
