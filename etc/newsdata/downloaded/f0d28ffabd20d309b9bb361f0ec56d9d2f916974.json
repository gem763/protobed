It uses \u201cdeepfake\u201d technology that is created with artificial intelligence -- technology that has drawn widespread concern over how it can be used.\n\nApp users took to social media to post about their own face swap with Zao, with many using shots of Leonardo DiCaprio from his \u201cTitanic\u201d role.\n\nIn case you haven't heard, #ZAO is a Chinese app which completely blew up since Friday. Best application of 'Deepfake'-style AI facial replacement I've ever seen.\n\n\n\nHere's an example of me as DiCaprio (generated in under 8 secs from that one photo in the thumbnail) \ud83e\udd2f pic.twitter.com/1RpnJJ3wgT \u2014 Allan Xia (@AllanXia) September 1, 2019\n\nIn less than a minute I became @LeoDiCaprio . #ZAO is one of the most accurate face lifting app. Also, bye bye privacy. pic.twitter.com/BRRl1G4T69 \u2014 Prakhar \u5e15\u5361 \u574e\u675c\u8fe6 (@prakharkhanduja) September 3, 2019\n\nYet following the app\u2019s viral surge, users began to notice its privacy policy that allegedly gave ZAO permission to use their faces for marketing purposes.\n\nThe user agreement said that those who used the app and uploaded their images to ZAO agree to surrender the intellectual property rights to their face, and permit ZAO to use their images for marketing purposes, according to Reuters.\n\nThe app has since updated its agreement page and the company said they \u201cthoroughly understand the anxiety people have toward privacy concerns,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nZao was pushed out by Changsha Shenduronghe Network Technology Co., which is owned by executives from Momo Inc., a company that created a widely-used dating app in China.\n\n\"Deepfake\" videos have raised concern over how realistic they look.\n\nOne video showed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appearing to talk about \"control[ling] the future,\" while another video by Buzzfeed had former President Obama seemingly discussing controversial opinions and spouting out a curse word. The Buzzfeed video, which was done as a PSA, later showed that it was actually actor and director Jordan Peele who was saying the words that looked as though they were coming out of Obama's mouth.", "description": "The app, Zao, came under fire over privacy concerns.
