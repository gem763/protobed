Even if you have no dance experience, you know when someone\u2019s insecure or when someone\u2019s not. I think that Hannah is trying her best but if you have downtime to look through your social media, don\u2019t!'\n\n'I think now, social media can actually be more negative than positive, and because you\u2019re past halfway through the competition, we\u2019re all susceptible because we\u2019ve worked so hard.
