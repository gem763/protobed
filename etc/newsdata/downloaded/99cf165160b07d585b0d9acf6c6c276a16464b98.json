And make them feel like maybe their voices don\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI started meeting all of these people who expressed to me how much the show meant to them \u2014 how it lifted their spirits during a bad breakup or got them through an illness. I was just so incredibly moved by that.\u201d\n\nAdded Aniston: \u201cAnd I began to change the way I thought about my own voice, and what it meant to have a platform to use it.\u201d\n\n'FRIENDS': JENNIFER ANISTON 'ALWAYS TRYING' TO WORK WITH HER FORMER CO-STARS\n\nAniston was one of six women recognized Friday as honorees, joining Awkwafina, Mariah Carey, Chaka Khan, Brie Larson and Dana Walden.\n\nThe \u201cHorrible Bosses\u201d star will make her return to TV as an executive producer in Apple\u2019s \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d a series that bears a resemblance to NBC\u2019s long-running \u201cToday\u201d program and focuses the drama-filled, highly-competitive business of producing morning news.\n\nAniston will star in the series for Apple\u2019s forthcoming streaming service alongside Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carrell, with \u201cThe Office\u201d funnyman portraying what appears to be a made-for-TV version of Matt Lauer.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, Aniston\u2019s character \u2013 Alex Levy, also a news anchor \u2013 has been marked as \u201cpast her sell-by date,\u201d by her male bosses, and must navigate her complicated personal and professional life while dealing with the fallout of Carrell\u2019s character being suddenly and very publicly fired for sexual misconduct.
