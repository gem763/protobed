The claim was quickly refuted by the National Weather Service office in Birmingham Alabama, which tweeted that Alabama would \u201cNOT\u201d see any effects from Dorian.\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) In addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!\n\nNWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx\n\nDespite their clarification, Trump repeated the claim at his press conference later.\n\n\u201cAnd, I will say, the states \u2013 and it may get a little piece of a great place: It\u2019s called Alabama,\u201d said Trump. \u201cAnd Alabama could even be in for at least some very strong winds and something more than that, it could be. This just came up, unfortunately. It\u2019s the size of \u2013 the storm that we\u2019re talking about. So, for Alabama, just please be careful also.\u201d\n\nAt that same press conference, held at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters in Washington DC, Trump expressed huge surprise at the \u201cmonstrous\u201d size of Dorian, saying he was not sure he had ever heard of a category 5 hurricane before.\n\n\u201cI have \u2013 not sure \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve ever even heard of a category 5,\u201d said Trump. \u201cI knew it existed. And I\u2019ve seen some category 4s; you don\u2019t even see them that much. But a category 5 is something that I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve even heard the term other than I know it\u2019s there. That\u2019s the ultimate. And that\u2019s what we have, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nBut, as observant viewers were quick to point out, this is a line he has trotted out before. There are at least four other occasions \u2013 including as recently as May \u2013 that he said he was astonished to discover category 5 hurricanes existed.\n\nDaniel Dale (@ddale8) President Donald Trump on the existence of Category 5 hurricanes, 2017-2019. pic.twitter.com/IRRny20hfp\n\nLast week, Axios reported that Trump had repeatedly suggested the US military should bomb hurricanes to disrupt them before they made landfall, a claim Trump strenuously denies.\n\nAccording to Axios, the president said in a meeting with top national security and homeland security officials about the threat of hurricanes: \u201cI got it. I got it. Why don\u2019t we nuke them?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey start forming off the coast of Africa, as they\u2019re moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d\n\nTrump responded to the story on Twitter, saying it was \u201cridiculous\u201d.\n\n\u201cI never said this,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cJust more FAKE NEWS!\u201d", "description": "Weather service scrambles to correct mistake by US president, which he later repeats", "authors": ["Kate Lyons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/779a48ac0b0cc8934202940031d245b288044418/1873_503_2269_1361/master/2269.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6d38243944d05a164d47679e5833de57"}
