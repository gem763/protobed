There are on-demand printing services like Printful or Society6 that can print art on tote bags and T-shirts. But custom-made items like enamel pins or acrylic charms come with production challenges that require finding the right suppliers that specialize in making those items. (Just check out this How It\u2019s Made video that shows how much manual work goes into making enamel pins.)\n\nIndonesian artist Meyoco\u2019s illustrations \u2014 which often take inspiration from Japanese pop culture and feature magical anime girls with wavy ocean hair, translucent bottles of Ramune, and Game Boys bursting with garden flowers \u2014 are the kind of special art you always want to carry on you and use to decorate everything you own.

What are the most difficult and rewarding parts of running your business?\n\nI\u2019ve been running my online store since around 2014! It used to be an on / off thing when I was still in university because I couldn\u2019t handle running a store full time. After I graduated in 2017, I decided to start opening my store regularly.\n\nThe most difficult part of running my business has always been handling customer service. I\u2019ve never been someone who\u2019s good at communicating with strangers, and getting emails used to give me a lot of anxiety. I would delay replying to order inquiry emails for several days because opening emails terrified me. Thankfully, I\u2019m no longer that fazed by emails, but I still find it to be a source of anxiety.\n\nThe most rewarding part of it is finding that people actually want to buy my products. I\u2019ve never been the best at anything \u2014 not at art or academics. I know I have a lot of areas to improve, and I\u2019m still thankful that people want to buy the stuff I make. This might come off a bit strange, but I also love packing orders. It can be quite therapeutic.\n\nWhat has your experience with finding the right suppliers been like?\n\nFinding the right suppliers, to me, involved a lot of trial and error. I\u2019ve changed suppliers several times over the years. For acrylic charms, I changed suppliers four times before settling with my current one. For pins, I changed suppliers twice. For washi tapes, I used to join group orders because the MOQ [minimum order quantity] for washi tapes is a little high. After I gained a bigger customer base, I started ordering washi tapes straight from my go-to supplier so I don\u2019t have to wait for someone to organize a group order.\n\nThe first time I started making my own merch for a convention back in 2013, I made acrylic charms and pins using whichever local supplier I could find on the internet. The quality of my first merch was not great. And to be honest, the sales weren\u2019t that good either. Initially, I limited my suppliers to only local suppliers because I wasn\u2019t sure I could afford printing in foreign suppliers. After I started selling my products internationally, I started looking for foreign suppliers that can print better-quality items. It was terrifying at first; I wasn\u2019t sure how to deal with customs fees, and paying hundreds of dollars to make products scared me a lot. However, after I got the hang of it, it was really worth it to see my work printed as good-quality products. Nowadays, I mainly print my products in China, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nOver the years, I usually changed suppliers because I was not satisfied with the quality of their work or because I found a better supplier. I also prefer suppliers with good customer service since I\u2019ve had the misfortune of dealing with extremely rude customer service. It really makes my work a lot easier when the suppliers I work with have decent, polite customer service.\n\nArt theft is a rampant issue that a lot of store owners have to deal with, and it seems like your art is especially susceptible to theft. Would you say there\u2019s always risk involved in making things, particularly on sites like Alibaba? Does watermarking help?\n\nI personally have never experienced having my designs sold off by my Alibaba suppliers, but I know that risk always exists with other suppliers. Of course, there\u2019s always a risk in making things. There are untrustworthy suppliers everywhere, so it\u2019s always important to research your suppliers well before making your products with them. From my experience, certain companies will state explicitly that they will not sell your designs, and they can make a contract with you so as to make sure that your design will be kept safe.\n\nTo be honest, when it comes to art theft, watermarking doesn\u2019t always help since thieves often simply Photoshop watermarks away. I\u2019m very lucky that my fans are always aware of when someone is selling my art without my permission.\n\nDo most people comply if you ask them to take something down?\n\nI\u2019ve never asked anyone to take anything down considering they never asked for my permission in the first place. Honestly, I don\u2019t even mind reposting without credit anymore because it just happens way too often, which is why I always use watermarks. However, when someone tries to profit from it, I try to blast them on my social media. After that, they will usually take my stolen stuff down.\n\nWhat would you say is your trademark style?\n\nI think my trademark style these days is clean line art with flat colors and plain, pastel-colored backgrounds. I also tend to use the same themes over and over again, such as florals and waves, so they become a part of my style. I also tend to use the same colors, especially pink, so I think it\u2019s become part of my trademark style as well.\n\nWhere do you take inspiration from?\n\nI mostly take inspiration from things that I like or bring me joy. I\u2019ve always loved flowers because they\u2019re fascinating and fun to draw. They can be drawn with pretty much anything. I love drawing game consoles because they\u2019re a part of my childhood. I also find them to be really fun to draw and combine with other objects, such as flowers or maybe even Ramune sodas! Rather than being inspired, I think I draw mostly because I want to have fun drawing things that I like.\n\nWhat\u2019s the art community in Indonesia like? Do you participate in a lot of cons?\n\nI feel like the art community in Indonesia, particularly its pop art community, is flourishing. There are so many good artists with incredible artworks here. The downside is that there are a ton of petty fights and people trying to bring each other down. There are people who will hate on each other for the most ridiculous, petty reasons. People will pretend to be your friend, then gossip about you behind your back. It\u2019s very difficult finding people you can trust. It\u2019s very uncomfortable, and, to be honest, I don\u2019t like interacting with my local peers unless it\u2019s with people I absolutely trust.\n\nI haven\u2019t participated in local cons for quite a while. The last time I participated in a local con, I had a lot of bad experiences, particularly from convention organizers who didn\u2019t seem to think of their tenants and visitors as anything but a source of money. There were issues of sexual harassment, rampant theft, and overcrowding as well. I didn\u2019t want to waste my money going to cons that I can\u2019t enjoy, so I decided to just focus more on my online store.\n\n[ONLINE STORE INFO] My online store will reopen on August 31st at 8PM PST!

Are there any specific kinds of things people are looking for, and do you take that into consideration when you make things?\n\nPeople really, really like enamel pins! It\u2019s always surprising to me since enamel pins aren\u2019t cheap to make and sell. I just started selling sticker sets, and those are really selling well, too. Of course, I take this into consideration whenever I make new items. People also love game console- and drink-themed merch, which is a good thing because I love designing products with those themes as well.\n\nYou\u2019ve warned other artists before about the dangers of equating social media metrics to self-worth. Can you explain a little bit more about that? Is it coming from your own experience?\n\nBack in 2013, I started using social media to share my art because I had very low self-esteem. I felt like none of my past acquaintances liked my work, and I thought I should start afresh by deleting all my past accounts and making an art account that none of my acquaintances know of. I thought getting the approval of strangers who didn\u2019t know me surely matters more than getting the approval of my past acquaintances. It was really petty, but it was my main motivation back then.\n\nI ended up getting more and more traction over the years, which helped heighten my self-esteem. Sometime in 2017, I felt like I was starting to hit a wall. I wasn\u2019t getting as many likes as I wanted, which made me feel like I wasn\u2019t working hard enough to earn more likes and followers. Social media metrics started dictating my happiness. I would obsess over the number of likes in each of my posts. I thought people would see me as a failure if they noticed that the number of likes on my posts isn\u2019t as high as I want. Over time, my mental health grew worse as a result.\n\nAround this time, I fell into a slump. It felt extremely difficult to just draw anything that I like because I will always get stressed over whether my audience will like it. I eventually decided to completely change my style to fit what my audience liked. I stopped doing watercolors because I felt like my audience doesn\u2019t like my watercolor artworks. I completely switched over to digital coloring, and I started drawing more objects instead of just people.\n\nI don\u2019t regret changing my style, nor am I embarrassed that my audience\u2019s approval matters that much to me. But it\u2019s not something I would wish on other artists. My self-worth relies too much on social media metrics, and it\u2019s not healthy, which I\u2019m still working to deal with.", "description": "Indonesian artist Meyoco explains how she runs her successful online store, while navigating customer service, suppliers, and art theft.", "authors": ["Dami Lee", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZJj5xINx6BAZbKtH2a-0X4cniDE=/0x459:5000x3077/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19238423/floral_boys.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
