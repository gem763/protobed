Back in 2010, Beth Tweddle won the uneven bars, with Louis Smith collecting silver on the pommel horse and Dan Purvis bronze on floor.\n\nWhile Whitlock extended his supremacy as the finest male gymnast in British history, long-standing followers of the team will remember this as the day when Becky Downie finally earned the individual medal that her reliable excellence deserves.\n\nAt 27, the elder Downie sister is probably performing at her last World Championships, in preparation for a final tilt at the Olympics next year.\n\nShe has been afflicted by injuries through her long career, and has come within touching distance at this event many times.", "description": "Until yesterday, Britain\u2019s performances at the World Championships at Stuttgart had been promising rather than brilliant \u2013 but that changed in spectacular style as Max Whitlock and the two Downie sisters all took medals in their individual finals.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Tennis Correspondent", "Sir Ian Mcgeechan", "Ben Bloom", "Moe Sbihi"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gymnastics/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212839728-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqvyIhey5-bbhpfCG1b5cFTRYttIy5bmvXE6XMwzZiu3k.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
