Brandon Lee and others.\n\nA Samsung representative confirmed that the company is canceling all extant Galaxy Fold preorders placed online through Samsung. It\u2019s a strange move, given that Samsung is so close to releasing the fixed phone. As a consolation prize, Samsung is offering customers a $250 credit for the Samsung store, but it\u2019s likely a disappointment for anyone who had been holding out for the actual foldable phone.\n\nSo Samsung canceled my pre-order for the Samsung Galaxy Fold...at least they gave me a $250 credit for anything on their store. That is admittantly quite generous.\n\n\n\nI guess I should rejoin the pre-order queue. pic.twitter.com/Nv7OAIMxnN \u2014 M. Brandon Lee | THIS IS TECH TODAY (@thisistechtoday) September 5, 2019\n\nPer Samsung\u2019s email, the canceled preorders are due to the company looking to \u201censure that you have the best possible experience with this revolutionary new technology,\u201d and it notes that the company is rethinking the entire process, including purchasing, unboxing, and service for the Fold (although it doesn\u2019t offer details). A Samsung representative also highlighted the recently announced \u201cGalaxy Fold Premier Service\u201d that Samsung will be offering for the Fold \u2014 presumably part of the new sales process \u2014 and promised more details closer to launch.\n\nSamsung has yet to reopen actual preorders for the updated, fixed Galaxy Fold. There is just a reservation line, so anyone with a standing preorder at this point is someone who preordered the phone back in April, and then specifically requested that Samsung not cancel their order when the company delayed the phone in May.\n\nThe new Galaxy Fold will be available on September 6th in Korea; September 18th in France, Germany, Singapore, and the UK; and \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d in the US (rumored to be September 27th).", "description": "Samsung may have finally fixed the Galaxy Fold and confirmed new release dates for the foldable phone, but anyone who preordered the phone earlier this year might still be out of luck: Samsung is emailing customers to cancel preorders while it \"rethink[s] the entire customer experience\" surrounding the sale of the phone.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KrdwbVpe8_GcmdWbL_hXyLW7AWA=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16162630/akrales_190418_3377_0404_a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
