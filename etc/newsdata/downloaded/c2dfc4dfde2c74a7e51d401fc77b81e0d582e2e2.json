I\u2019m becoming 90.\u201d\n\nAs is true of the best comedians, Newhart is an impeccable wordsmith and has the career highlights and enduring success to prove his mastery. An inarguable description of Newhart\u2019s precise and singularly droll take on life: ageless.\n\n\u201cThe Button-Down Mind Of Bob Newhart,\u201d released in 1960, was the first comedy record to hit No. 1 on the Billboard pop album chart and made him the only standup, still, to win a Grammy as best new artist. He scored TV hits with \u201cThe Bob Newhart Show\u201d in the 1970s and \u201cNewhart\u201d in the \u201880s, and delighted 21st-century viewers with his Emmy-winning turn as Professor Proton on \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d\n\nThe typed page of his famed bit in which President Abraham Lincoln gets image advice from a marketing consultant is going into the Smithsonian\u2019s popular culture collection.\n\nWork keeps coming his way, including requests to mark his birthday on stage. But he decided he\u2019d rather spend the day with his wife of 56 years, Ginnie, and their family. The Chicago-area native talked about his staying power and early career to The Associated Press, with the interview edited for clarity and length.\n\nAP: When someone reaches an impressive milestone birthday, there\u2019s an obligation to share tips with the rest of us hoping to get there.\n\nNewhart: I\u2019ve said it before, but of all the weird things, comedians\u2019 marriages seem to last the longest: George Burns and Jack Benny and Buddy Hackett and (Bob) Hope. I think there\u2019s something between longevity and laughter. You\u2019ll be having a fight, and you\u2019ll say something stupid and then start to laugh, and then she\u2019ll start to laugh, and then the fight\u2019s over. I think laughter is vital. It\u2019s as vital as breathing. It gets you through difficult areas. Laughter is one of the most beautiful sounds in the world. It\u2019s like music, of a kind.\n\nAP: Is that part of what\u2019s kept you working for so long?\n\nNewhart: I\u2019m amazed at the longevity. The album had just come out, and I was just learning how to do standup and I was the opening act for Peggy Lee at the Harrah\u2019s club in Lake Tahoe. I had 15 minutes of material and I did it, and the stage manager said, \u201cGo back out. They\u2019re applauding.\u201d I said that\u2019s all I had, and he said, \u201cThey\u2019re applauding.\u201d So I went back out and asked, \u201cWhich one do you want to hear again?\u201d and they yelled out what they wanted. That\u2019s how raw I was. I had a hit record and I was just starting out. I had to learn my craft backward.\n\nAP: You started out as an accountant. Is it hard to imagine that might have been your life?\n\nNewhart: I played a club before the album came out, and they (the audience) had no idea who I was and I died, every night. Not a snicker. You could hear the air conditioning. I would have welcomed a cough, just some sound coming from the audience. Every comedian in the world has gone through that. We did two shows a night, seven days a week, and that\u2019s about the time that accounting started to look really good to me. Then I played at another club, in Winnipeg (Canada), and it went well. And I thought, maybe I\u2019ll stick around for a while.\n\nAP: Do you have an all-time favorite bit, maybe Lincoln?\n\nNewhart: That was Jack Benny\u2019s favorite. I always felt Abe was the best piece of writing I ever did. It\u2019s probably more true today than it was in 1960 when I recorded it. You see the machinations going on now. I read a book back then, Vance Packard\u2019s \u201cThe Hidden Persuaders,\u201d about subliminal advertising and packaging a product, including presidents. That\u2019s what we\u2019re all watching right now, the packaging. It\u2019s the same way they package soap.\n\n___\n\nLynn Elber can be reached at [email protected] and on Twitter at http://twitter.com/lynnelber.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Congratulate Bob Newhart on turning 90 on Thursday, and he offers a polite critique in return.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Lynn Elber"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/tv-qa-bob_newhart_52813_c0-159-3790-2368_s1770x1032.jpg?d3ac6dc331757302cf95dbafbcdeae910b7377c2"}
