Stroll around the ponds and flowers, stopping in the northeast corner to see the tribute to Wolfe Tone, an 18th-century revolutionary considered the father of Irish republicanism. Note the slabs of stone lined up behind his statue; Dubliners, who love to nickname public monuments, have dubbed it Tonehenge. Stroll down Dawson Street toward an aperitif at Peruke & Periwig, a cozy and atmospherically lit bar. Chatty bartenders whip up some of the city\u2019s best cocktails (around \u20ac13 each) with spiced gin, local whiskey and enhancements like apple-wood smoke. The cozy second floor, with its velvet chairs, oil paintings and windows looking down onto the bustling street, is an excellent place to sequester yourself for an hour or two.\n\n4) 9 p.m. New Irish cuisine\n\nBook ahead for dinner at Clanbrassil House, where the chef Grainne O\u2019Keefe brings a new approach to old ideas in dishes like Killary Fjord mussels from the west of Ireland, bathed in a spicy XO broth, and smoked trout layered onto charred sourdough and topped with pickled cabbage. This small restaurant opened in 2018 and serves some of the most innovative plates in Dublin: sausage made in house from pork cheeks; marmalade ice cream; and hash brown fries with an onion mayonnaise. Interesting, Eurocentric wines are served by the glass, and the family-style option, in which the kitchen sends out a range of small plates, starters, mains and desserts, is a fun way to snack around the tempting menu. Dinner runs around \u20ac120 for two, including wine.", "description": "A vibrant culture of Irish food, crafts, booze, literature and music offers a weekend of diversions, but it\u2019s Dublin\u2019s complex history and its welcoming spirit that will linger longest.", "authors": ["Nell Mcshane Wulfhart"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/travel/26Hours-Dublin2/26Hours-Dublin2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
