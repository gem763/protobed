In August, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Turkey against conducting such an action, stating there would be \u201cpotentially devastating consequences.\u201d\n\nTurkey, an important NATO ally, has been threatening to attack Kurdish-led U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces as it is led by the YPG militia, or People\u2019s Protection Units, the Syrian version of the Kurdistan Worker\u2019s Party, which it considers a terrorist organization.\n\nThe SDF, who is also a close partner to the United States in the fight against IS in Syria, was integral to recapturing the terrorist organization\u2019s final so-called caliphate in the war-torn country in March.\n\nIn late August, the United States and Turkey signed an agreement to install a security mechanism along the Turkey-Syria border to prevent IS from resurging in the area.\n\nA main part of the agreement consisted of the SDF removal of its military fortifications and the withdrawal of its combat troops from near the border to address Turkey\u2019s security concerns.\n\nSDF said following the U.S. announcement Sunday that Erdogan has now transformed the agreement into \u201ca mechanism of death\u201d and \u201cthe stable & secure region into a zone of conflict and permanent war.\u201d\n\nBased on our confidence in the #US efforts in the Security Mechanism agreement, we implemented all our commitments to remove military fortifications between Tal Abyad & SereKaniye, withdraw combat forces with heavy weapons, risking a security vacum as a result of the agreement.\u2014 Coordination & Military Ops Center \u2013 SDF (@cmoc_sdf) October 7, 2019\n\nThe Kurdish militant group said by complying with the agreement to remove its troops and fortifications from the border, it created a \u201csecurity vacuum\u201d but it did so on the confidence it had in the United States.\n\nSDF said the threat of war will reverse the defeat of IS as its leaders in hiding will re-emerge and break its fighters out from prisons and camps housing tens of thousands of IS family members, threatening local and international security.\n\n\u201cWe see the Turkish threats as extremely serious,\u201d SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said in an interview with Voice of America. \u201cWe fear that mass killings would be committed against our people if Turkish forces invaded this part of Syria.\u201d\n\nThe United States also said Sunday that Turkey would be taking responsibility for the potentially thousands of foreign-born IS fighters from SDF custody.\n\nThe announcement came six days after the U.S. Defence Department released its fiscal year 2020 joint strategic oversight plan, in which it said it \u201csupports the leadership of the Syrian Democratic Forces.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 7 (UPI) \u2014 The White House said it will be removing U.S troops from northern Syria ahead of a Turkey military advance to expel Kurdish forces", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
