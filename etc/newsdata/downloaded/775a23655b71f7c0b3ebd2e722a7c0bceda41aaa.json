Homeless Killings: Randy Santos", "language": "en", "text": "Here\u2019s what we know about Mr. Santos:\n\nEarly Saturday morning, Mr. Santos, walked through Chinatown stalking men who lay on the ground. He swung a three-foot, 15-pound metal pipe at their heads, killing four men, including 83-year-old Cheun Kok. Another man was critically injured. The first attack happened at about 1:30 a.m., when a homeless man asleep in front of 17 East Broadway was struck in the head and killed, according to a criminal complaint. Minutes later, three men were attacked with a metal bar in front of a pharmacy at 2 East Broadway near Chatham Square, an attack filmed by a security camera. Two died. Then at about 1:50 a.m., a fifth sleeping man was clubbed a block north at Doyers Street and East Broadway; he also died. Two passers-by witnessed the last attack and called the police, who arrested Mr. Santos at about 2 a.m. at Canal and Mulberry Streets, still carrying a metal bar with blood and hair sticking to it.\n\nPeople who knew Mr. Santos in the Bronx neighborhood where his mother lives said he appeared to be unraveling mentally in recent weeks. He had been doing odd jobs for his mother\u2019s neighbors, Lydia and Segundo Segarra, cleaning up debris in their yard, but stopped showing up in late September. \u201cHe seemed lost,\u201d Mr. Segarra said. \u201cHe would forget that he just saw you.\u201d The day before the attacks, residents of the building where Mr. Santos\u2019s mother lived saw him lying down in an empty hallway, possibly trying to get his mother's attention to let him in. Mr. Santos, generally quiet and affable toward neighbors, was withdrawn. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t making eye contact,\u201d said Candy Santos, 41, who had no relation. \u201cHe was just laying there. There was something in his eyes that felt different. It\u2019s like he wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nMr. Santos had previously been accused in a string of violent assaults targeting random people. Much of his record is sealed, but he had most recently been arrested in May, when he was kicked out of a men\u2019s shelter in East Flatbush. He pummeled another 24-year-old shelter resident in the face. That case was dismissed. A year ago, Mr. Santos choked a 55-year-old man and bit his breast at an employment agency in the garment district in Manhattan, the police said. He had leapt across the counter to attack the man. Four days later, he was on a northbound Q train, between Canal Street and Union Square stations, when he yelled out, \u201cWe need to stop it!\u201d and punched a 33-year-man in the eye. He was charged with both assaults.\n\nThere were more incidents this year. On Feb. 25, police officers spotted Mr. Santos enter the Hoyt-Schermerhorn subway station in Brooklyn through an exit gate without paying and arrested him. At the precinct, he spat on the floor toward a sergeant, the police said. Less than a week later, he was arrested on a charge of groping a 19-year-old woman at the front door of her apartment building in Jamaica, Queens.\n\nHis family in the Bronx had kicked him out. His mother, Fioraliza Rodriguez, told The Daily News she was afraid of him. \u201cI never thought he would kill someone,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid of him, though, because he punched me. That\u2019s when I told him to get out of my house.\u201d The Daily News also reported that Mr. Santos broke his grandfather\u2019s nose in 2016, and sneaked into the family\u2019s home last week and stole a watch, a phone and three phone chargers.\n\nDenielda Jordan, a neighbor of Ms. Rodriguez, observed Ms. Rodriguez refusing to let Mr. Santos into her apartment. But the mother would give food to her son. \u201cIf your mother doesn\u2019t let you in the house, there\u2019s a problem,\u201d Ms. Jordan, 58, told The New York Times. The Post reported that Mr. Santos had been living in squalor inside an abandoned house at 691 East 183d Street, near his mother\u2019s apartment.\n\nMr. Santos most recently worked in construction, a job he lost because of excessive drug use, said Nelson Reyes, also a neighbor of Ms. Rodriguez. \u201cHe started smoking crack,\u201d said Mr. Reyes, 39, in an interview with The Times. \u201cThen he started losing his mind.\u201d", "description": "Randy Rodriguez Santos, 24, had a history of violence and strange behavior before he was charged with murder on Sunday.", "authors": ["Nikita Stewart", "Ashley Southall", "Katie Van Syckle"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/nyregion/07santos/07santos-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
