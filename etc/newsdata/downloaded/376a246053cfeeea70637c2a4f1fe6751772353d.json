Their reaction: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d\n\nThat was one of the comments posted on the staff-wide communications system at the co-working company, reflecting a broader mood throughout its headquarters in New York.\n\nDozens of employees expressed indignation in interviews and messages to colleagues on company Slack channels that were relayed to Bloomberg. They requested anonymity in a bid to protect their jobs, as management weighs the dismissal of thousands of employees.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWeWork\u2019s board agreed on Tuesday to take a bailout from SoftBank, which will secure an 80 per cent stake. The Japanese conglomerate will provide $6.5bn to the business that is on the verge of running out of money.\n\nSoftBank will also buy as much as $3bn in stock from shareholders. Almost a third of that offer may be allocated to Mr Neumann, in addition to a consulting fee of about $185m and a $500m loan, people familiar with the matter have said. In exchange, Mr Neumann will step down from his role as chairman.\n\nRepresentatives for Mr Neumann and WeWork declined to comment. A spokeswoman for SoftBank didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr Neumann, 40, built WeWork into a global real estate company fuelled by relentless optimism and billions of dollars in investment capital and debt. His sermons about community and mission engendered fierce loyalty among staff and investors for years.\n\nBut his aura vanished over the last couple months when public investors were given a closer look at the business ahead of an initial public offering (IPO). WeWork\u2019s parent, The We Company, abandoned the IPO, and SoftBank helped oust Mr Neumann as chief executive officer.\n\nIn recent weeks, an executive exodus and cost-saving measures had already dampened morale. Especially in satellite offices, many workers had stopped coming into work. News of Mr Neumann\u2019s \u201cplatinum parachute\u201d, as one former employee described it, made things a lot worse this week.\n\nA link to a news article about the deal on WeWork\u2019s Slack network on Tuesday drew more than 100 \u2018thumbs down\u2019 emoji from employees. Several workers noted the irony that WeWork could not afford payroll costs associated with the planned job cuts but that its largest shareholder, Masayoshi Son\u2019s SoftBank, agreed to pay a hefty fee to Mr Neumann. One post read: \u201cSo we\u2019re too broke to pay employees severance, but Adam gets $200m?\u201d\n\nAnother employee posted a photo of the orphan from \u201cOliver Twist\u201d with the caption: \u201cPlease, Masayoshi Son, can I have some severance?\u201d\n\nMr Neumann was the main subject of ire from staff, but some complaints were also pointed at the pair of men who replaced him as CEO last month: \u201cSeriously, where\u2019s the email from our co-CEOs or whoever\u2019s running the company now?\u201d\n\nBloomberg", "description": "Adam Neumann, the eccentric co-founder of WeWork, will leave the board of the crisis-stricken company pocketing over $1bn (\u00a3778m), while thousands of his ex-colleagues face losing their jobs.
