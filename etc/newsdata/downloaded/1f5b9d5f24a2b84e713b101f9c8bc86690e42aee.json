The iPhone 6 from 2014 heralded a dramatic redesign with a larger screen that came to define how iPhones would look until the iPhone X launched in 2017.\n\nNow, in 2019, I\u2019m here to tell you that the days of expecting major technological advancements that fundamentally change what we can do with our phones every year \u2013 or even every two years \u2013 may be behind us.\n\nThe iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro, which are launching in stores Friday, share many characteristics with the iPhone XS and the iPhone XR, which Apple introduced last year. They come in the same screen sizes, can recognize your face through Face ID just like the iPhone X phones before it, and have the same notch cutout near the top of the screen for the selfie camera and facial-recognition sensors.\n\nRead more: How Apple\u2019s new iPhone 11 Pro compares to its biggest rival, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10\n\nBut they also improve on the iPhone in the areas that matter most: namely when it comes to camera quality and battery life. That\u2019s as important as ever for Apple, which has been grappling with slowing iPhone sales as smartphone shipments, in general, have been declining.\n\nThe iPhone 11 starts at $700, while the iPhone 11 Pro starts at $1,000, and the larger 11 Pro Max will set you back at least $1,100.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at what it\u2019s been like to use the iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro over the past few days.\n\nCamera\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to tell the difference between last year\u2019s iPhone and the iPhone 11 or the iPhone 11 Pro, the camera will be a dead giveaway.\n\nThe iPhone is getting a triple-lens camera for the first time with the iPhone 11 Pro and the 11 Pro Max, the Pro\u2019s larger sibling that comes with a 6.5-inch display. And the less expensive iPhone 11 comes with a dual camera, an important characteristic that distinguishes it from last year\u2019s iPhone XR.\n\nAll three phones include a 12-megapixel ultrawide-angle camera with a 120-degree field of view and a 12-megapixel wide-angle lens. That ultrawide-angle camera makes it possible to capture more of the scene in a single shot \u2013 meaning you should no longer have to tell everyone to squeeze in tight to fit in the frame when taking group shots.\n\nThis is by no means a feature that\u2019s entirely new to smartphones; Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 and the OnePlus 7 Pro already offer this too.\n\nThe Pro model also has a 12-megapixel telephoto lens for achieving a better zoom unlike the iPhone 11. In addition to offering a more sophisticated zoom, you can also switch between this telephoto lens and the wide-angle lens to change the perspective of your portrait mode shots thanks to the Pro model\u2019s third lens.\n\nThe ultrawide-angle camera is a useful addition to the iPhone, but it\u2019s the iPhone 11\u2019s new Night Mode that impressed me the most during my testing. The mode automatically kicks in when you\u2019re taking photos in a dark environment, and I\u2019ve found that shots taken on the iPhone 11 in the dark came out crisper, brighter, and clearer than those taken on the Galaxy S10 or the Google Pixel 3a XL. This feature works on all three of Apple\u2019s new iPhones.\n\nWhen shooting in a daytime outdoor setting, the iPhone 11 certainly performed well \u2013 but was only marginally better, if at all, than the much less expensive $480 Pixel 3a XL. Both phones took images that were vibrant and sharp with accurate color, outperforming the Galaxy S10\u2019s photos, which looked overexposed in comparison.\n\nThe iPhone\u2019s selfie camera is also getting an upgrade from 7 megapixels on last year\u2019s model to 12 megapixels on this year\u2019s lineup. And selfies taken on the iPhone definitely look great, especially when compared with those taken on the Galaxy S10, which once again made colors look too bright and blown out. The Pixel 3a XL gives the iPhone 11 tough competition, but I still felt that the iPhone\u2019s image offered more defined details.\n\nScroll through the images below to see a few sample shots.\n\niPhone 11 (Bright outdoor shot)\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nGoogle Pixel 3a XL (Bright outdoor shot)\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nSamsung Galaxy S10 (Bright outdoor shot)\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\niPhone 11 Pro (Low light)\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nGoogle Pixel 3a (Low light)\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nSamsung Galaxy S10 (Low light)\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nBattery life\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nWith the iPhone 11, you can rest assured that you won\u2019t be left stranded in search of a power outlet. I used the iPhone 11 Pro for roughly a day and a half \u2013 about 32 hours \u2013 without charging it and still had about 15% of its battery left.\n\nI\u2019d usually consider that to be normal; after all, most of the phones I test can last for about a day and a half on a single charge. But I accidentally left the phone\u2019s screen at maximum brightness for about two hours after a video shoot \u2013 while also setting the display to never time out \u2013 and was still able to get regular battery life. (This was while using the regular Pro; you can probably expect to get slightly longer battery life out of the larger Pro Max.)\n\nThe iPhone 11 seems to be performing well when it comes to battery life, too. At the time of writing, I\u2019ve been using the phone from about 6:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., and I still have 71% of juice left.\n\nBattery life will always vary depending on how you use your phone. During this testing period, I used these phones for checking email, browsing social media, taking photos, streaming music (roughly one to two hours) and video (roughly 20 minutes), and checking my job\u2019s Slack channel. If you use your phone for similar tasks, you can probably expect battery results like this.\n\nThe new iPhones also finally come with an 18-watt charger for juicing up your device more quickly \u2013 a much-requested upgrade from the smaller charging brick that older iPhones came with.\n\nDesign\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nThere\u2019s another physical characteristic that makes the new iPhones stand out from their predecessors: their colors and design. The iPhone 11 Pro and the Pro Max have a new textured matte back, which gives the phones a more premium feel. It also makes them less prone to fingerprint smudges if you\u2019re brave enough to use them without a case compared with rivals like the Galaxy S10.\n\nThe iPhone 11 has the more familiar glossy glass back that makes it resemble the iPhone XR, but it comes in new colors that have a pastel-like aesthetic.\n\nOne trait that hasn\u2019t changed much, however, is the notch cutout that sits near the top of the display. It\u2019s just as noticeable as it was last year and the year before on the iPhone X, which is somewhat disappointing considering other smartphone makers like Samsung have done more to make that cutout blend more seamlessly into the phone\u2019s display.\n\nSamsung, for example, has squeezed the front-facing camera and facial-recognition sensors into a tiny circular space carved out near the top of the screen on its Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10 phones. That makes the design seem all the more striking since it creates a more convincing illusion that the screen stretches from edge-to-edge.\n\nBut that may have its consequences, however, as the Galaxy S10\u2019s facial recognition is said to be less secure than Apple\u2019s, and security should definitely be prioritized over aesthetics.\n\nThe new iPhones also lack an in-screen fingerprint sensor unlike rivals such as Samsung, which means you have fewer choices of how to unlock your phone compared with alternatives.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro has gotten some enhancements when it comes to durability, too. The Pro models can withstand being submerged in up to 4 meters of water for as long as 30 minutes. Last year\u2019s iPhones, and the iPhone 11, can handle being dunked in only 2 meters of water for the same period of time.\n\nDisplay and audio\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nThe iPhone 11 and the 11 Pro have also gotten some minor upgrades when it comes to the display and audio quality. The Pro\u2019s screen is now brighter than that of last year\u2019s iPhone (and the 11), but you\u2019ll most likely notice this only when using the phone outdoors in very sunny conditions.\n\nThe cheaper iPhone 11 also has an LCD screen versus the 11 Pro\u2019s OLED screen, similar to the difference between last year\u2019s iPhone XR and iPhone XS. This isn\u2019t too noticeable in everyday use, but the difference does become obvious whenever the screen turns mostly black \u2013 whether it be a dark transition between scenes in a movie trailer or a wallpaper with a mostly black backdrop. That\u2019s because LCD screens can\u2019t reach the same level of blackness as OLED displays.\n\nAll of the new iPhones also have spatial audio playback, which provides a mildly noticeable boost in sound quality. This was most evident when watching movie trailers on the 11 versus the iPhone XS Max, since it made the cinema score sound richer and more full-bodied. But since I use headphones more often when listening to music or watching video on my phone, I didn\u2019t find myself making use of the spatial audio very much.\n\nShould you get it?\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to decide whether to upgrade to the newest iPhones, I\u2019d urge you to think about what features matter most to you and how much you\u2019re willing to spend.\n\nThe upgrade is certainly worth it if you\u2019re operating on an older model like the iPhone 7 or earlier, but if you have an iPhone X or an iPhone XS, you\u2019ll probably want to hold off for at least another year or so. Unless you\u2019re really itching to try to use that ultrawide-angle camera or take better photos in the dark, the improvements in this year\u2019s model most likely aren\u2019t crucial enough to justify an upgrade.\n\nPerhaps you already know you want the latest iPhones, but you\u2019re not sure whether to go with the iPhone 11 or the 11 Pro. That decision boils down to how much having an extra camera lens really matters to you.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro has a telephoto lens for better zooming in addition to its wide-angle and ultrawide-angle lens; both of the latter are also found on the iPhone 11 Pro. That extra lens also gives you more flexibility when it comes to taking Portrait Mode shots, since you can opt for a bokeh-style shot with a tighter zoom through the telephoto lens or one that takes in more of the scene with the wide-angle lens.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s screen is also brighter than the 11\u2019s and offers better contrast and deeper blacks, but you probably wouldn\u2019t notice that enough to let it significantly affect your buying decision.\n\nThe iPhone 11, given the fact that it shares many of the features of the Pro at a much lower price, is probably the right choice for most people. But camera professionals who need the flexibility of shooting with three lenses instead of two might be more interested in the Pro.\n\nTaken together, the updates in the iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro also say a lot about the state of the smartphone industry. That Apple is positioning its lower-cost iPhone 11 as its flagship model this year shows that it learned an important lesson from last year\u2019s iPhone XS and XR launches \u2013 many people don\u2019t want to pay $1,000 or more for a new smartphone.\n\nThe fact that Apple is catering toward professional photographers and videographers with its new iPhones is also notable. It suggests that in an era in which people are holding onto their smartphones longer than before, the company is looking to niche audiences \u2013 not just general buyers \u2013 to encourage upgrades.", "description": "Business Insider - Apple's iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro are launching on Friday.
