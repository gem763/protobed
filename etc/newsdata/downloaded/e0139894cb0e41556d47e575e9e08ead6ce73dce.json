The Boom in Selling Vintage Underwear Online", "language": "en", "text": "Around this time last year, Olivia West went to an estate sale held in a five-story brownstone in Boston\u2019s Fenway neighborhood, not far from the Museum of Fine Arts. West, who is 23, runs Fern God Vintage, an Instagram and Etsy account where she sells period clothes. The woman who lived in the apartment had passed away, and the family wanted to sell some of her belongings for quick cash.\n\nAn old steamer trunk caught West\u2019s eye, but it was locked shut. She wanted to know what was inside, so someone at the sale\u2014\u201ca guy who looked like Indiana Jones,\u201d West told The Daily Beast\u2014tried to pick the lock. That didn\u2019t work, so eventually they drilled straight through.\n\nUnderneath the apartment\u2019s Tiffany glass skylight, West opened the wardrobe and found a trove of vintage corsets dating back to the 1940s and \u201950s. She took the items home. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, I guess I\u2019m going to sell this now,\u2019\u201d West recalled.\n\nToday, West runs her vintage business via Instagram and Etsy, sans physical storefront. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic millennial hustle,\u201d said West, who also works in audio engineering. \u201cI don\u2019t do it every single day, probably twice a week, but I make a lot more [money] than what I put into it.\u201d\n\nKristy Zikowitz, 36, runs Keeping It Vintage out of her home in New Jersey, where she lives with her husband and three young children. She scoops pieces up at thrift stores like the Salvation Army and Goodwill. \u201cI never pay more than $1 for an item, usually less,\u201d said Zikowitz. \u201cI can make anywhere from $200 some weeks, or $700 to $800 during others. I don\u2019t do too bad for a stay-at-home mom.\u201d\n\nThe idea of selling used panties online may conjure up images women FedExing their dirty thongs to basement-dwelling kinksters, but consigned underwear has evolved from a fetish into a fashion. Since social media shopping has become as easy as clicking on a link in bio, more women are comfortable with hunting for vintage online\u2014whether they\u2019re in the market for a dress, or something worn underneath.\n\n\u201c People are like, \u2018This is my grandma\u2019s underwear I\u2019m selling, just take it\u2019 \u201d\n\nWest has sold pieces to a museum curator from Norway, plenty of fashion designers, and Instagram models who only want to wear historically accurate clothing. At a recent estate sale, she found a collection of handmade lace garter belts. \u201cPeople are like, \u2018This is my grandma\u2019s underwear I\u2019m selling, just take it,\u2019\u201d West said.\n\nOlivia Capierseho just turned 24 and lives in Miami Beach, Florida. This December marks her third year running Ivia Retr\u00f2, where she hawks vintage lingerie, plus other clothes and handmade swimsuits. She\u2019ll travel two hours to hit up promising thrift stores, and spends about three hours sifting through stock.\n\n\u201cHigh-cut, \u201990s style lingerie is a trend right now,\u201d Capierseho said, \u201cespecially little silk dresses and corset tops that were originally used as girdles underneath clothes.\u201d According to her own Instagram analytics, Capierseho says that most of her customers are young women age 18 to 24 who live in New York or Los Angeles.\n\nModel-tall with a \u201cBella Hadid body,\u201d as a shopper recently raved in an Instagram comment, Capierseho usually poses in lingerie before she sells it. She stands in front of a cream lace backdrop, torso in frame, head just cropped out, wearing nightgowns or bodysuits like a classical bust dressed for a night out at Studio 54.\n\n\u201cI think part of the brand\u2019s success is my personal style, and the way I model it helps to sell the pieces a lot,\u201d Capierseho said. \u201cI do this full time, and it\u2019s just me right now. In the future, I want a full crew to help.\u201d She usually spends a day shooting 10 to 15 items with her camera placed on a tripod.\n\nAt first Zikowitz wanted to hire a model for her shop, but her husband suggested she star in her own advertising. \u201cEverything I post a picture of myself in, sells. When I post the stuff just hanging, or not on a body, that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nIn other words: \u201cPeople like to look at pictures of women in lingerie.\u201d\n\nZikowitz enlists her friend, another stay-at-home mom, as her official photographer. The two shoot outside near her front porch. \u201cSometimes we wonder what the neighbors think, or the FedEx guy,\u201d Zikowitz laughed. \u201cWhat would happen if the other PTO (Parent Teacher Organization) moms saw my page? I don\u2019t care; I need good lighting.\u201d\n\nThe seller added that her wedding ring is always visible in every photo. Zikowitz cuts her head out of most images, because in her words, \u201cNo one cares about your face.\u201d\n\n\u201c I get all these creepy men, so many old men [reaching out], and their bios always say, \u2018I love my family, I love my cars, I love my country.\u2019 It\u2019s like dude, I\u2019m selling stuff, not trying to bang. Step off \u201d\n\nMost of the women agreed that sexual harassment is a part of the job, with men sliding into their DMs asking for dates or more photos. \u201cI get all these creepy men, so many old men [reaching out], and their bios always say, \u2018I love my family, I love my cars, I love my country.\u2019 It\u2019s like dude, I\u2019m selling stuff, not trying to bang. Step off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had some guy messaging me saying, \u2018I want a woman who looks like you,\u201d West added. \u201cI think it\u2019s that chauvinist idea of wanting a woman who is dressing and acting like it\u2019s the past. It\u2019s gross, but they\u2019re boosting the post, so whatever.\u201d\n\nIn an ideal word, West thinks, Instagram would better protect its vintage sellers. But she\u2019s also realistic. \u201cThey should probably do something, but I don\u2019t have a lot of faith in them to do so,\u201d she said. \u201cJust being a woman in the world, this stuff happens, but I don\u2019t think Instagram cares or understands that.\u201d\n\nAll the dealers are quick to point out that they hand wash every item, downplaying the seedier reputation of selling used underwear. \u201cYou\u2019d think people would be weird wearing secondhand stuff, but they\u2019re not,\u201d Zikowitz said.\n\nRaquel Dardik, MD, is a gynecologist and clinical associate professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at NYU Langone Health. For Dr. Dardik, a vintage item is wearable so long as it has been \u201cthoroughly cleaned prior to use.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe garment is only in contact with the external portion of the vaginal area, and there is no known association between the age of underwear and infections,\u201d she said. While no method of cleaning will eliminate every germ, according to Dr. Dardik washing eliminates bacteria and dirt, which is good enough.\n\nHowever, Dr. Dardik warns patients away from wearing underwear made of \u201cfabrics that don\u2019t breathe and are not natural\u201d because those materials can increase moisture, and with that comes the risk of irritation or potential infections. Such materials include polyester, nylon, and silk\u2014and vintage lingerie is often made of the latter.\n\nEven if a piece is diligently laundered, every wash cycle can harm intimates, which are also known as \u201cdelicates\u201d for a reason. According to Shelley Tobin, an assistant curator at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum and author of Inside Out: A Brief History of Underwear, \u201cCleaning and laundering can weaken fibers and damage old textiles.\u201d\n\nJust like fashion, women\u2019s underwear has evolved with time and cultural movements. According to Dr. Benjamin Wild, a cultural historian and co-host of the podcast Dress: Fancy, marketers began using the term \u201clingerie\u201d to sell intimates in 1922\u2014just as flappers were redefining what it meant to look feminine.\n\n\u201cWith the adoption of this world, there is a sense that companies were becoming increasingly aware of the need to acknowledge and cater for women\u2019s individual, personal needs; their want to be regarded as desirable for themselves, and not solely for the significant men in their lives,\u201d Dr. Wild told The Daily Beast.\n\nSince then, women\u2019s underwear styles have played catch-up, following the lead of popular clothing silhouettes. When hemlines got shorter in the \u201960s, stockings fell out of favor, replaced by pantyhose. With \u201970s bohemia came a rejection of girdles or shapewear; \u201980s power dressing carried on beneath high-shoulder blazers, with padded busts by Vanity Fair and Wonderbra.\n\nFans of vintage lingerie throw around words like \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cromantic\u201d when they describe what attracts them to the styles. But the women who first wore that sexy garter didn\u2019t have access to the birth control pill, and the first owner of Victorian bloomers couldn\u2019t vote.\n\n\u201cFor a contemporary woman to dress in the styles of underwear from a time when her sex had much less political and social authority can make for a highly provocative, and potentially enjoyable, statement for the wearer,\u201d Dr. Wild said. Or maybe, of course, they just like the way it looks.\n\nMen have a harder time finding their own retro underwear. The dealers who spoke with The Daily Beast said there was practically no male market to speak of. Men generally wear their clothes until they fall apart, they said, so the pieces do not survive intact long enough to become vintage.\n\nBut according to Tobin, the early 1980s saw an increased interest in men\u2019s long underwear, also known as a union suit. \u201cYou would see girls wearing them styled in different ways, maybe under dungarees or on their own with Dr. Marten boots,\u201d she said. But when retailers began to make women's leggings, demand for vintage pieces fell off.\n\nWhatever the reason for buying, lingerie resale isn\u2019t a necessarily new trend, though the ease of Instagram shopping has revived interest. According to Tobin, hippies interested in Edwardian fashions often bought \u201cwhite lace-trimmed underwear and nightwear,\u201d though it was sold by antique dealers who did not necessarily specialize in consignment clothing.\n\n\u201c I have a lot of beautiful two-piece baby doll tops and underwear, matching sets with lace, and people are not interested in that. They want shape wear; the tight silhouette from the 50s are really coming back \u201d\n\nToday, Zikowitz still sells her fair share of flowing, white nightwear, mostly to women planning their wedding night trousseau. \u201cBrides will buy when they want something older, because lingerie never goes out of style. Jeans do, but lingerie doesn't,\u201d she said.\n\nWest finds her customers less into romantic styles and more craving tight shape wear, like the old school version of Kim Kardashian's SKIMS. \u201cI have a lot of beautiful two-piece baby doll tops and underwear, matching sets with lace, and people are not interested in that. They want shape wear; the tight silhouette from the \u201950s is really coming back,\u201d she said.\n\nAsk a different dealer and you'll get a different answer: others told The Daily Beast that the \u201980s and \u201990s, and early Victoria's Secret styles, are the most popular. But juxtaposed against hundred-year-old nighties and bloomers, are Y2K-era teddies really \u201cvintage\u201d at this point?\n\nYes, says Vincent Quan, an associate professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology. \u201cThe definition of vintage varies,\u201d Quan said. \u201cSome people think it has to be the Victorian era, from the 1800s and on. Honestly, vintage is 20 years ago. That\u2019s 1990. It\u2019s such a broad range\u20142000s will be vintage pretty soon.\u201d", "description": "As retro styles comes back into fashion, millennials reveal why they are selling vintage underwear online: \u201cPeople are like, \u2018This is my grandma\u2019s underwear...just take it.\u2019\u201d", "authors": ["Alaina Demopoulos", "Style Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2700,w_4800,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572037229/191025-alaina-vintage-underwear_lwts8w", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
