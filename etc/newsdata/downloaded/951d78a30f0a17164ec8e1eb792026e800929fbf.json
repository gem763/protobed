Taking matters \u2013 and emails \u2013 into her own hands, the young woman wrote back to the grocery retailer, politely articulating why she had the chops for the gig. To her surprise, Aldi rescinded their rejection and invited her back for an interview.\n\nOn Sept. 2, Jessica Irving of Sydney took to Facebook to share the triumphant tale in a post that has since gone viral with over 16,000 likes and 9,000 shares.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe this worked,\u201d the 18-year-old declared.\n\nIn a three-part series of screenshotted emails, Irving first shared a message from the recruitment team at Aldi, detailing that her application for a retail assistant job would not be advancing in the job selection process, News.com.au reports.\n\nCHICK-FIL-A MAKES 500 SANDWICHES FOR FIRST RESPONDERS AFTER TEXAS SHOOTING SPREE\n\nCreatively, Irving fired back with a message of her own.\n\n\"Although my application was rejected, I have been applying for jobs for over a year now with no success,\u201d the teen replied. \"My skills are on par with your store, with the ability to be exceptionally fast-paced to scan items like every ALDI Team Member does.\u201d\n\n\u201cI pride myself on my impressive sale skills and can describe myself to be very persuasive and show effectiveness,\u201d she continued. \"So persuasive in fact, that I would like to confidentially [sic] reject your rejection.\u201d\n\nCheekily thanking the recruiter for \u201cletting me be part of the team,\u201d Irving signed off with an assurance that she\u2019d be at the store on the following Monday for a 9 to 5 shift.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nTo Irving\u2019s delight, her bold tactic worked. In the third and final email she shared, the Aldi reps thanked her again for applying and invited her back for a group interview.\n\nIn the hours since, Irving described Aldi\u2019s initial snub as a \u201chuge bummer,\u201d as she had looked forward to applying to the local branch of the German-based food retailer for nearly a year.\n\n\u201cWhen applying for the job I thought I'd be a really strong candidate. I even waited almost a year to apply due to their 18-plus rule,\u201d she told the Daily Mail in a Sept. 3 interview.\n\n\u201cIt's one of my local stores so being rejected was kind of a huge bummer and I didn't want to apply for a store so far away so I thought I'd give it a go and it worked, surprisingly,\u201d she continued.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFortunately, Irving said she suspects her honest second try earned her kudos with a higher up.\n\n\u201cI guess a different manager \u2014 they must have been impressed by my approach,\u201d she mused.\n\nReps for Aldi were not immediately available to comment on the saga.", "description": "\u201cI cannot believe this worked.\"", "authors": ["Janine Puhak", "Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle.
