Their stay is the first visit to Pakistan by members of the royal family since 2006.\n\nIn the coming days the couple will meet both Imran Khan, the prime minister, and the president, Arif Alvi.", "description": "The Duchess of Cambridge arrived in Pakistan with a nod to both her hosts and the memory of her mother-in-law, wearing a traditional shalwar-kameez style outfit from one of Princess Diana's favourite couture houses.", "authors": ["Ben Farmer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/royal-family/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000213026174-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwYDpM1iOj7her_R_5PUySDU.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
