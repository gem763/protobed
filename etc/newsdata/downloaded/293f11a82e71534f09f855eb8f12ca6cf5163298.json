Civil guards can be seen checking the papers of workers arriving at the Valley of the Fallen where his remains are currently interred\n\nGuards at the entry of the Valley of the Fallen monitor traffic in and out of the site as it is closed ahead of Francisco Franco's body being exhumed on Thursday\n\nNeither media nor the general public will be allowed to watch the the proceedings on Thursday.\n\nIn preparation the Government has shut the Valley of the Fallen and traffic in and out of the memorial is being monitored.\n\nThe relocation of Franco's tomb continues to fracture Spanish opinion with 43 per cent in favour of the move and 32.5 per cent against, according to a poll published by El Mundo last week.\n\nFranco ruled Spain with an iron first after victory in the civil war in 1939 until his death in 1975.\n\nHe remains a contentious political touchstone in Spain and the tomb was seen by many as glorifying a fascist regime and its members.\n\nGeneral Francisco Franco (1892-1975)\n\nThe Socialists have long sought to turn the Valley of the Fallen into a memorial to victims of the civil war, unleashed by Franco, in which about 500,000 people were killed.\n\nNearly 34,000 dead from the civil war are buried there, including many who fought for the losing Republican side and whose bodies were transferred to the site during Franco's dictatorship without the permission of families.\n\nFranco's family had appealed both against exhuming his remains and against the government's plans to move them to the El Pardo cemetery.\n\nWere his remains to be moved, they wanted them to go to the Almudena Roman Catholic Cathedral adjacent to the Royal Palace in central Madrid, alongside his daughter.\n\nA government report said last December that the Almudena cathedral, located right in the centre of Madrid not far from the royal palace, was unsuitable as a burial place for security reasons.\n\nA visitor to the Valley of the Fallen makes a Nazi salute while standing in front of the central facade", "description": "The Spanish government has announced its plans to exhume the former general's body from the colossal mausoleum at the Valley of the Fallen, where it has been interred since his death in 1975.", "authors": ["Corazon Miller", "Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/24/12/18865646-0-image-a-5_1569323609609.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
