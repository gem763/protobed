I was very confident with my performance last week, so it did come as a shock. But I always leave room for disappointments so that it doesn't hurt me too much.\n\nDo you think that there is anything you could have done differently to get more votes?\n\nNo, I feel like I gave my best and ultimately South Africa votes for who they want in the competition and at the end of the day, there can only be one winner.\n\nWhy did you decide to enter again this season, after being eliminated in the theatre rounds in season 14?\n\nIf I didn't make it this far my second time around, I wasn't planning on coming back to audition again. Me coming back this time was to prove to myself that you never give up on yourself. And I didn't make it, and that's okay because this was still a win for me.\n\nWhat's the one piece of advice from the judges that you will hold on to?\n\nRandall told me in theatre week to get rid of the vibrato, and I felt that was the most crucial advice I got and I will use it for the rest of my career.\n\nWhat's next for your music career?\n\nLet's wait and see! I am very optimistic about the future, and I will do my best to stay relevant.\n\nTune in to Idols SA Sundays at 17:00 on Mzansi Magic (DStv 161).\n\n\n\nCompiled by Leandra Engelbrecht.\n\n\n\n(Photos supplied: Mzansi Magic)", "description": "It was the end of the road for Idols SA contestant, Dinky Kunene who is the second contestant to be eliminated for the competition.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8331/4ec56303eb2f49ac89e374835c596b7f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
