REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File Photo\n\nThomas stands accused in a police complaint of criminal breach of trust, forgery and falsification of records in relation to PMC\u2019s dealings with the now bankrupt realty company Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL.NS) (HDIL).\n\nHe had been detained for questioning earlier this month and kept in police custody.\n\nOn Thursday, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate\u2019s court in Mumbai ordered that Thomas be jailed while the probe into the fraud continues.\n\nPMC allegedly made more than 21,000 fictitious accounts to hide loans it made to HDIL. Last month, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took control of the functioning of PMC and initiated a forensic audit. It has also capped withdrawals by depositors, sparking protests.\n\nPMC has not responded to the allegations, the latest scandal to taint India\u2019s troubled banking sector. The administrator appointed by the RBI to oversee PMC was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.\n\nThomas\u2019s lawyer told the court that his client was acting under instruction of the bank\u2019s board of directors.\n\nPolice late on Wednesday also arrested Surjit Singh Arora, a former director of PMC who was a member of its loan committee.\n\n\u201cHe abused his official position to facilitate fraud and he needs to be interrogated thoroughly,\u201d police said of Arora in a court filing seen by Reuters.\n\nHDIL\u2019s former senior executives Sarang Wadhawan and Rakesh Wadhawan and PMC\u2019s former chairman Waryam Singh are also in judicial custody and are being investigated.\n\nWaryam Singh\u2019s lawyer denied any wrongdoing by his client and said he wasn\u2019t aware of the allegations. HDIL and Arora\u2019s lawyers were not immediately available for comment.\n\nIndia\u2019s financial crime fighting agency this week said it had identified and seized assets worth more than 38.3 billion rupees, including two private jets, a yacht and several luxury cars which it says belong to HDIL\u2019s directors and promoters, PMC bank officials and other related entities.", "description": "An Indian court on Thursday sent the former managing director of Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank, Joy Thomas, to jail as a probe into an alleged 43.55 billion rupees ($610 million) fraud intensifies.", "authors": ["Abhirup Roy", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441888322&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G19M", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
