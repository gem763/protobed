Turkey asserts it wants to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria to resettle 3.6 million refugees from the Syrian civil war who are currently residing in Turkey, while Kurdish forces in northern Syria warn that Turkey wants to weaken their hold on the region by flooding the region with Sunni Arab Muslims.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief,\u201d McGurk wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe sends military personnel into harm\u2019s way with no backing. He blusters and then leaves our allies exposed when adversaries call his bluff or he confronts a hard phone call.\u201d\n\nMcGurk had resigned from his post in December 2018 after Trump announced a withdrawal of U.S. troops from other parts of Syria. The withdrawal came after Trump declared ISIS defeated.\n\nMuch of the fighting with ISIS was carried out by the largely Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces, who have expressed alarm at a U.S. withdrawal from northern Syria, as it leaves them open to attack from Turkey. Turkey considers the SDF a terrorist organization, as the latter has links to Kurdish militants hostile to Turkey.\n\nMcGurk warned that a withdrawal from northern Syria would leave a detainee camp whose prisoners include \u201cthe nucleus for a resurgent ISIS\u201d to be managed by Turkey, which, he wrote, has no interest in maintaining the camp.\n\nTurkey has neither the intent, desire, nor capacity to manage 60k detainees in al Hol camp, which State and DoD IGs warn is the nucleus for a resurgent ISIS. Believing otherwise is a reckless gamble with our national security.
