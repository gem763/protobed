I still can't believe': Murphy's shock ahead of coronation at British Champions Day", "language": "en", "text": "Nothing can be more draining for a sportsman or sportswoman than the weight of expectation.\n\nWhen Oisin Murphy is crowned champion Flat jockey for the first time at Qipco British Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday, relief will battle hard with joy in the emotion stakes.\n\nMurphy, 24, has been earmarked as champion material since bursting on to the scene in 2013, when his 41 wins included a high-profile four-timer on Ayr Gold Cup day.\n\nOisin Murphy (above) is set to be crowned champion Flat jockey for the first time on Saturday\n\nThe following year, Murphy was champion apprentice and by 2016 he was No 1 jockey to the powerful Qatar Racing operation.\n\nThe fast-tracking was no surprise. He\u2019d been a good enough junior showjumper to have that as a career option and was riding out at Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Ballydoyle operation while still at school. But even the pinnacle of riding achievements barely seems enough for the rider from County Kerry.\n\nHe said: \u2018It will be lovely to look at Wikipedia and see Oisin Murphy as champion jockey but then you\u2019ll look down and see Kieren Fallon was champion jockey six times. I have only done it once.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t get my head around how jockeys like AP McCoy did it numerous years at a time. How they coped with the physical workload and the mental strain. Now it is done and dusted, I do not look at myself and think I am champion jockey. Maybe I will when I collect the trophy.\u2019\n\nMurphy is currently on 166 wins for the season, 35 ahead of second-placed Daniel Tudhope\n\nUltimately, Murphy will win the title easily. His 166 wins to date are 33 more than closest rival Danny Tudhope, but the figures do not reflect a titanic struggle. On June 15, Murphy was 15 clear but the lead ebbed away and on July 20 Tudhope went nine ahead with five winners in a day.\n\nThe tide turned when Murphy rode four doubles in five days, but he concedes he felt the strain.\n\nHe said: \u2018When I went behind I was really under pressure. I could not believe I had allowed myself to fall away.\n\n\u2018I could only blame myself. I was getting beaten on favourites and could not work out why. It got to me. But after I got over feeling sorry for myself, I started to ride better.\u2019\n\nLast year, Murphy upped his game, but missed out on the title, which was won comfortably by Silvestre de Sousa. To gain an edge, Murphy made two decisions in 2019: cut down riding out in the morning to conserve energy and avoid damaging bans.\n\nOn Saturday, Murphy\u2019s family, including Cheltenham Gold Cup and Grand National winning uncle Jim Culloty, will descend on Ascot, where his rides include Benbatl (Queen Elizabeth II Stakes), Deirdre (Champion Stakes), Sparkle Roll (Fillies and Mares Stakes) and The Tin Man (Champions Sprint).\n\nFor Murphy, there are more titles to win and big races to land. Being champion is just the start.", "description": "INTERVIEW BY MARCUS TOWNEND: Nothing can be more draining for a sportsman or sportswoman than the weight of expectation.", "authors": ["Marcus Townend For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/20/19752492-0-image-a-5_1571166077591.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
