There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by either of the Bidens.\n\nMr Trump also requested the Ukrainian president look into the origins of the US probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, to seemingly support his unfounded claim that Ukraine was behind foreign interference rather than the Kremlin.\n\nThe US Intelligence Community has confirmed Russia was responsible for a multi-pronged influence campaign that sought to undermine the candidacy of former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in favour of Mr Trump.\n\nHe referred to a memorandum of the president\u2019s phone call with Ukraine on multiple occasions, saying a \u201cplain reading\u201d of the five-page documents shows \u201cthere was no quid pro quo\u201d.\n\nThe vice president also told reporters he stood by his comments from a 2016 debate in which he said foreign governments shouldn\u2019t get involved in domestic elections.\n\nHe then ignored shouted questions noting that Mr Trump suggested, in front of network cameras on the White House lawn, that China should start an investigation into the Bidens.\n\nAt one point a reporter asked Mr Pence: \u201cThe president himself has said that he asked a foreign government to investigate his domestic political rival \u2026 so, is that OK with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case,\u201d Mr Pence responded. \u201cI know that\u2019s the way [House Intelligence Committee] Chairman [Adam] Schiff characterised it in his manufactured transcript.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president said it on the lawn,\u201d a reporter replied.\n\nMr Pence was speaking outside of an event in Wake, Iowa, where he addressed supporters about the president\u2019s trade policy.\n\nHe encouraged Americans to read the memorandum, which he repeatedly referred to as a transcript, saying \u201cthey will see that the president did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no pressure,\u201d he added. \u201cThere was no quid pro quo. The president simply raised the issues of importance and interest to the American people.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report\n\nRead more\n\nWhite House: Trump spoke with Ukraine about US probe into Joe Biden", "description": "Mike Pence says he will release transcripts of his phone calls with Ukraine and denied Donald Trump asked for foreign help in his re-election efforts, despite the president appearing to do exactly that on the White House lawn just days ago.The vice president said he was working with the White House counsel", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ao0Pq.JDLvNPmVsfYz8Vdw--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/969bf952aada45301125904d4178bb34", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
