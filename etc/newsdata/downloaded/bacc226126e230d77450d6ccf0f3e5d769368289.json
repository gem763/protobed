That was the tiger that I mounted ... I have only myself to blame,\u201d she moaned.\n\n\n\nThat was the first clear signal that a project was under way by those who believed the party was theirs to reclaim.\n\nInitially, there was clandestine manoeuvring to oust Mmusi Maimane on the basis of a poor election performance and the loss of some wards in municipal by-elections.\n\nThis kind of ferment is quite normal in post-election periods as parties conduct post-mortems and identify scapegoats.\n\nAnd it is quite legitimate to blame a leader for a decline in fortunes.\n\nIn the UK and other mature democracies, leaders often voluntarily step down after disappointing results, and others get pushed out by their structures.\n\nBut in the case of the DA, the mutiny seems to be driven by racial and ideological imperatives.\n\nThose who want Maimane (and presumably a large cohort of black leaders) out are arguing that the party needs to go back to its liberal roots and that it become a denialist of the country\u2019s apartheid-induced inequality and historical social dysfunction.\n\nUncomfortable about the mass influx of black members to the ranks and how this is changing the character of the party, the self-proclaimed real liberals are using a return to traditional liberalism as a thin disguise for a return to the past.\n\nThat, however, was until Institute of Race Relations (IRR) analyst Herman Pretorius shed any pretence as to what the project was about.\n\nThe IRR has been closely linked to the stalled idea of forming a breakaway purist liberal party and has been critical of the direction the party has been taking.\n\nIt is associated with what may be regarded as the old guard of the DA and was Zille\u2019s employer until Friday.\n\nShe now wants to get back into leadership structures.\n\nIn an opinion piece published in the IRR\u2019s publication The Daily Friend, Pretorius motivated for Maimane\u2019s removal and for the installation of Western Cape Premier Alan Winde as leader.\n\nHe cited Winde\u2019s leadership and governance credentials before moving on to the real reason.\n\nHe said that \u201cthe seed of the DA\u2019s recovery has been planted by a white man in the Western Cape\u201d, and this man would do the same at national level.\n\n\u201cThe white, steady, reliable, white-haired male premier of the Western Cape could, in these uncertain and desperate times, provide that jolt of clarity of purpose for a flailing party,\u201d wrote Pretorius, with not a tinge of shame that he was uttering such despicable nonsense in the year 2019.\n\nHe added that Winde\u2019s election to the leadership of the party would somehow kill \u201cthe evil of identity\u201d and reintroduce to South African politics the notion that the colour of your skin is irrelevant to whether you can serve your country.\n\nNetwerk24 Foto: Adrian de Kock\n\nWith the nation aghast, the DA condemning him and Winde embarrassingly distancing himself from the race-based nomination, it was Zille who stepped forward to defend the blatantly racist intervention by Pretorius.\n\n\n\nIn about a fortnight, this bruising battle will come to a head and there will be no winner.\n\nIf the mutineers win and make the DA white again, they will contribute to the acceleration of the racial polarisation that is gaining momentum in South Africa.\n\nA whitened DA \u2013 rather than a diversified one \u2013 will be grist to the mill for those who want to play the populist politics of race in the governing party and elsewhere.\n\nNever mind the damage to the DA itself, South Africa\u2019s body politic and discourse will be poorer.\n\nIf Maimane and his crew win this battle, the war will not be over.\n\nThe mutineers will regroup in the hills, re-arm and launch strike after strike in the hope of eventually taking the city.\n\nThe party will be paralysed and permanently at war with itself.\n\nWith the ANC stuck in the same rut and expending so much energy on internal issues that it is unable to move the country forward, South Africa will have its two main parties mired in strife and distracted from governance conversations.", "description": "It was starkly evident as early as May that something was afoot in certain quarters of the DA.
