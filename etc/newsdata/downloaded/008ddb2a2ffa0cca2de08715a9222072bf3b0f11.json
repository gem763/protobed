We don\u2019t want any abuses to occur,\u201d Schweizer said. \u201cBut I think people that come up to me and say, \u2018Well what about the Trumps?\u2019 \u2013 there\u2019s a stark difference here. And that stark difference is that the Trump\u2019s have a corporate empire with golf courses and hotels and with condos and with other things that has been in existence far before Donald Trump ever announced his campaign for presidency. It\u2019s the family business. It\u2019s like if Michael Bloomberg ran as a Democrat for president of the United States, and he became president. He would come with his business empire.\u201d\n\nSchweizer continued, \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about with the Bidens in the case of China is completely totally different because Hunter Biden, before his father was vice president, was a lobbyist. He was a lobbyist for the online gambling industry and I\u2019m sure that takes a certain skill set. But it has no skill set related to what he does soon after his father becomes vice president of the United States, which is he goes into a completely different profession and area, which is private equity, and he starts doing deals around the world. He does them in China. There is certainly the one in Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo my point is the Trumps are in the business that they were in long before [Trump] ever announced he was going to be president,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd they have agreed to say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to do any new major deals overseas.\u2019 And we certainly need to hope that they honor that, and it needs to be watched. But in the case of the Bidens you\u2019re talking about saying, \u2018We\u2019re going into a new line of business in which we have no background right after Dad becomes vice president, and we\u2019re going to strike these deals with foreign governments in the case of China.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThis deal that they got with the Chinese government to establish this company Bohai Harvest RST is really really unusual,\u201d Schweizer explained. \u201cIt was set up in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, which allows the money invested to flow in and out of the country. No other investment firm had this deal \u2013 not Goldman Sachs, not Deutsche Bank, not J.P. Morgan. It was unique. And so the question has to be asked: Why, oh why, of all the private equity firms in the world did the Chinese government select this small boutique firm that had only been around for a couple of years that was headed by a guy with no background? Why did they give him the deal and not give it to Deutsche Bank or Goldman or anyone else? I think we all know the answer to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, to me, yes, there are certainly legitimate questions and issues that people can raise about conflicts of interest or deals involving the Trumps,\u201d he said. \u201cBut really purely by looking at them for ten minutes, you realize the issues with the Biden case are far, far, far more troubling because of the nature of them, the scope of them, and who they are involved with.\u201d\n\nSchweizer also noted that the Biden family\u2019s business deals with foreign governments have compromised them because their financial existence is contingent on these foreign governments. That is not the case with the Trump family real estate business, which was formed independently of Trump\u2019s political rise.\n\n\u201cThe fact is the Biden family\u2019s financial fortunes are now really tied up with the good graces of the Chinese government,\u201d Schweizer said. \u201cIf you look at the Trumps, you\u2019ve got people staying in their hotel from around the world. If one foreign government gets mad and says we\u2019re not going to stay in the Trump hotel again, it does not have the kind of financial economic effect that the Bidens upsetting or angering the Chinese government might have on the future economic fortunes of Hunter Biden.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM\u2019s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).", "description": "The sweetheart deals Hunter Biden\u2019s private equity firm secured with foreign governments are not comparable to the Trump family's real estate empire, Schweizer explained.", "authors": ["Rebecca Mansour"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/GettyImages-84379588-crop-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
