The producers meet again on Dec. 5-6.\n\nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said U.S. oil production is likely to peak in the next few years as current oil prices are capping the pace of expansion.\n\nThe brisk pace of U.S. production, now the world's highest, in the past few years has been a key factor behind the relative weakness in oil prices.
