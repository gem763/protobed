The official subsequently ceased to be a director of the mosque.\n\nA forthcoming book The Qatar Papers reveals that under Mr Abouliaquin QCUK also signed a partnership with Mosaic, a student mentoring organisation founded by the Prince of Wales in 2007, and at one stage was a sponsor of its flagship Enterprise Challenge.\n\nQCUK changed its name to Nectar Trust in October 2017. It continued to fund similar projects and its sole donor remained the Qatar Charity (QC) in Doha.\n\nAccording to its financial balance sheet on March 31, 2018, it received \u00a327.7 million from QC that year.\n\nIn August last year the Charity Commission issued a warning about its \u201cindependence\u201d over its ties to a Qatari group later designated as a terror organisation by its Gulf neighbours.\n\nYousef al-Kuwari quit as chief executive in May 2018. However he remained chief executive of QCQ, which was designated a proscribed organisation by the Gulf states in 2017.\n\nThe Qatar Charity made substantial contributions to a group called the Alsace Muslim Association (AMAL), for which Aboulhana also worked as an exective assistant from 2014 until around September 2016.\n\nAMAL managed the An-Nour mosque, the largest mosque in France, built close to Hanane Aboulhana\u2019s family home in Mulhouse and frequently visited by Mr Abouliaqin while he was QCUK\u2019s director general.\n\nOn 23 January 2016, during the mosque\u2019s construction, a memo from Aboulhana\u2019s QCUK email address, warning that a shortage of funds threatened to bring work to a halt, was forwarded by Mr Abouliaqin to Salah Al-Hamadi, number two at the charity.\n\nAccording to the French magazine Valeurs Actuelles, he replied in Arabic that \"Sister Hanane's words are very logical \".\n\nMr Al-Hamadi resigned as a director of Qatar Charity on 20 November, 2017. Mr Abouliaquin quit as DG of the Nectar Trust secretariat by early 2018.", "description": "A woman who was killed by special forces troops after she stabbed two prison guards worked for the director general of a British charity which hands out millions of pounds to mosques and community groups, The Telegraph can reveal.", "authors": ["Patrick Sawer", "Edward Malnick", "Henry Samuel", "Senior News Reporter", "Sunday Political Editor", "Vernon Bogdanor", "Con Coughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213286929-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
