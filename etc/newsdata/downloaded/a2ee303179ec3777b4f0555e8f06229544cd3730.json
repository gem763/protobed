This match should have been abandoned by the officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now time for UEFA to step up and show some leadership. For far too long, they have consistently failed to take effective action.\u201d\n\nThe first step of UEFA\u2019s protocol was enacted after 28 minutes when England defender Tyrone Mings was subjected to abuse and an announcement was made calling on supporters to stop using racist chants.\n\nThe second step, according to UEFA\u2019s protocol, is for the players to be sent to the dressing rooms for a specified period.\n\nThis was never implemented in Sofia although UEFA said there had been a discussion with the England bench after the second incident and they had agreed to continue as it was so close to halftime.\n\nStep three, according to UEFA, is \u201cafter consultation, abandon the match if the discriminatory behaviour still does not cease or breaks out again.\u201d\n\nUEFA is yet to comment officially on the incidents.\n\nThe threat of racism had dominated the buildup to the game and part of the stadium was empty after UEFA punished Bulgaria for racist behaviour by fans during June\u2019s qualifiers against the Czechs and Kosovo.\n\nBulgarian supporters also made monkey chants at visiting black players when England last travelled to Sofia for a European qualifier in 2011, prompting UEFA to fine the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) 40,000 euros ($44,072).\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nKick It Out said the punishments were futile.\n\n\u201cThe fact Bulgaria are already hosting this game with a partial stadium closure for racist abuse shows that UEFA\u2019s sanctions are not fit for purpose,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThere can be no more pitiful fines or short stadium bans. If UEFA care at all about tackling discrimination \u2014 and if the Equal Game campaign means anything \u2014 then points deductions and tournament expulsion must follow.\u201d", "description": "Anti-racism organisation Kick It Out has criticised European football's governing body UEFA for failing to abandon Monday's Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria after England's black players were subjected to monkey chants.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441069035&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0QN", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
