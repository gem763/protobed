All three major stock indexes closed in the red on Tuesday. There was good and bad news for supporters of both Brexit and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Walt Disney stock (DIS) jumped and Netflix stock (NFLX) tumbled after Verizon Communications (VZ) said it will give wireless customers one free year of Disney+. In today\u2019s After the Bell, we...\n\nlook at the latest Brexit vote and its implications;\n\ncheck on global crude prices and OPEC\u2019s plan;\n\nand wonder why existing-home sales fell in September despite low mortgage rates.\n\nProtracted Divorce\n\nStocks ended the day with small losses, as investors continue watching the development of multiple geopolitical issues and gauge the level of uncertainty. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 39.54 points, or 0.15%, to close at 26,788.10. The S&P 500 has lost 10.73 points, or 0.36%, to finish at 2995.99, and the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 58.69 points, or 0.72%, to close at 8104.30.\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s divorce from the European Union has been stuck in back-and-forth negotiations since the U.K. voted to leave the bloc in 2016. Less than a week ahead of the Oct. 31 deadline\u2014already extended from Mar. 29\u2014it seems that the Brexit saga may have finally come to an endgame.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.K. lawmakers voted to endorse Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s new Brexit deal. However, in a second vote minutes later, lawmakers rejected the three-day timetable proposed by Johnson\u2019s government to push the deal through by the end of the month. Lawmakers said they needed more time to look at the deal and won\u2019t rush to meet the Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nThe British government has already requested the EU leaders for a delay to Brexit, but Johnson said he would call an election if the parliament tried to push the ratification beyond the end of the year.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nAs prospects for global growth and oil demand weakens, crude prices have been under pressure despite the supply disruption in some regions. Against that backdrop, OPEC members and allies will reportedly consider making deeper reductions to crude output when they meet in Vienna this December.\n\nOn the news, global oil benchmark Brent crude gained 1.26% to $59.70 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, while West Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.59% to reach $54.16 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Lifted by higher crude prices, energy stocks in the S&P 500 were the best-performing sector within the index, rising 1.3% on Tuesday.\n\nSales of existing homes dropped 2.2% in September to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.38 million from 5.50 million in August. September sales were also lower than the 5.40 million economists were expecting. Despite the monthly decline, sales were 3.9% higher than a year ago.\n\nThe September decline in sales doesn\u2019t necessarily mean consumers are less willing to buy houses. After all, mortgage rates have been declining as the Federal Reserve continued to ease its monetary policy. The tight supply in the housing market might be one of the reasons: Inventories were down from last year, while the median sales price increased across all four regions nationwide.\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com", "description": "All three major stock indexes closed in the red on Tuesday.
