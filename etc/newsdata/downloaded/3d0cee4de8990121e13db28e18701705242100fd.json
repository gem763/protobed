Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s challenge in the final days of the campaign will be to limit the losses and, crucially, defend the CDU\u2019s first place position in Saxony.\n\nFor Kramp-Karrenbauer, who both grew up and built her political career in the far reaches of western Germany, the former territories of the German Democratic Republic are almost foreign territory. Nonetheless, if the CDU, which Kramp-Karrenbauer has led since December, loses substantial ground there, the \u201cEast\u201d \u2014 as Germans still refer to the former GDR \u2014 could put a quick end to her hopes of becoming Germany\u2019s next chancellor.\n\nA poor result would fuel a debate over whether \u201cAKK,\u201d Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s preferred moniker, has what it takes to be chancellor. Following a series of political missteps in recent months, some in the party are already asking that question.\n\nThe problems began in March, when a toilet joke Kramp-Karrenbauer made during a Karneval event was perceived by some as homophobic. Then, after the CDU suffered major losses in the European Parliament election, she accused a young German YouTube personality who scored a smash hit with a video critical of the CDU of manipulating public opinion. To make matters worse, she suggested such content should be censored in the future, opening her up to criticism that she wants to place controls on free speech.\n\nMeantime, the law-and-order rhetoric Kramp-Karrenbauer began using on issues such as migration, meant to help shore up the CDU\u2019s right wing and stem the rise of the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD), backfired by pushing moderate CDU voters to the Greens. The Greens have shot up several percentage points in national polls since Kramp-Karrenbauer took over the CDU to pull neck and neck with the center-right party. Though much of the Greens' support comes from disgruntled former Social Democrats, the party is also drawing a substantial number of votes from the CDU, according to recent exit poll data.\n\nHer stumbles as party chief prompted Merkel to tap Kramp-Karrenbauer as defense minister last month following Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s nomination as European Commission president. The high-profile defense portfolio would offer Kramp-Karrenbauer a perfect opportunity to prove her mettle, Merkel argued.\n\nDown on Merkel\n\nSo far, the surprise appointment has only increased the scrutiny of Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s every move.\n\nThe main reason for that decline has little to do with Kramp-Karrenbauer, but everything to do with her political mentor \u2014 Merkel.\n\nThat\u2019s why she has so much riding on the East, and particularly on Saxony.\n\nWhile the latest polls suggest the CDU still has a comfortable lead, with 31 percent, compared with 25 percent for the second-placed AfD, the conservatives have lost more than one-fifth of their support since 2014. An AfD victory would be unprecedented, marking the first time the party has finished first in a regional election (even if it wins, the party is unlikely to govern because the other major parties have ruled out a coalition with the far-right group).\n\nThe main reason for that decline has little to do with Kramp-Karrenbauer, but everything to do with her political mentor \u2014 Merkel. Merkel\u2019s refugee policies are particularly unpopular in Saxony and other eastern states, where many people worry that the new arrivals will change Germany\u2019s culture and sap federal resources.\n\nDresden, the state capital, is the birthplace of PEGIDA, an anti-refugee protest movement that spawned weekly demonstrations against \u201cIslamization\u201d across Germany. During an event to celebrate German reunification in 2016 in the city, Merkel was heckled as a Volksverr\u00e4ter, a traitor to the German \u201cVolk.\u201d\n\nGerman state election campaigns usually revolve around local questions, but in Saxony, which has suffered a burst of racial violence over the past couple of years, the national has become local. Both Merkel\u2019s migration policy and her government\u2019s plan to end coal-fired electricity generation, which will hit Saxony\u2019s coal-mining region, have dominated the campaign.\n\nThough the state has done quite well since reunification \u2014 unemployment is under 6 percent and both Dresden and Leipzig are booming \u2014 many people fear that Merkel\u2019s policies, in particular migration, could jeopardize their economic progress. Worries about falling down the socio-economic ladder are particularly pronounced in the East, where many families were hit hard by the dislocation triggered by reunification.\n\nMichael Kretschmer, Saxony\u2019s Christian Democrat premier, has sought to subtly distance himself from the chancellor by changing the subject.\n\n\u201cIf you make your decision a political protest against 2015 and Frau Merkel you\u2019ll achieve nothing, \u201d he told an audience on the campaign trail last week, referring to Merkel\u2019s 2015 decision to keep Germany\u2019s border open to refugees. \u201cThis is about Saxony.\u201d\n\nSoul of the CDU\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s close association with Merkel is just one reason she\u2019s been a rare sight on the campaign trail until now.\n\nIn an open letter in June, local CDU officials accused Kramp-Karrenbauer of \u201carrogance\u201d in her treatment of the East. The officials took umbrage with Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s public criticism of Kretschmer for meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and accused her of lacking sensitivity for the East\u2019s long connection with Russia.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer sought to mend fences in a pair of private meetings with her critics. But the tensions broke into the open again last week after she said that Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen, the former head of the Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence service, didn\u2019t belong in the CDU.\n\nMaa\u00dfen was forced to resign as intelligence chief after a series of controversial remarks, including publicly questioning Merkel\u2019s characterization of a racially motivated attack caught on video in the city of Chemnitz last year as a coordinated manhunt.\n\nMaa\u00dfen\u2019s dismissal made him a hero in right-wing circles in the CDU, including in Saxony, where he has been a sought-after guest speaker at local campaign events.\n\nAsked during a newspaper interview last week whether she thought Maa\u00dfen should be thrown out of the party, Kramp-Karrenbauer responded: \u201cThere are high hurdles for expelling someone from the party, and for good reason. But when it comes to Mr. Maa\u00dfen\u2019s attitude, I don\u2019t see anything that really connects him with CDU.\u201d\n\nInstead of talking about train travel, the defense minister has been on the defensive.\n\nThough she didn\u2019t call for Maa\u00dfen\u2019s removal, her comments were taken as major provocation by the conservative wing of the party who see the CDU as a Volkspartei, a big tent party that should be accommodate a range of views. Even Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s supporters criticized her, complaining that her comments did nothing but elevate Maa\u00dfen\u2019s standing.\n\nThe comments overshadowed what should have been a notable political victory for Kramp-Karrenbauer last week: her success in introducing free rail travel for German soldiers, a move meant to improve moral in the country's armed forces.\n\nInstead of talking about train travel, the defense minister has been on the defensive. Even a week after the Maa\u00dfen comments, she continues to face questions over what she really meant.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer's response has been that she doesn\u2019t want to \u201cbetray the soul of the party\u201d by embracing the right-wing positions espoused by Maa\u00dfen.\n\nIf the CDU loses Saxony, she'll stand accused of an even greater betrayal.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "The conservatives struggle to keep Saxony, an eastern German state where Merkel\u2019s refugee policy is deeply unpopular.", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1163945754-1200x628.jpg"}
