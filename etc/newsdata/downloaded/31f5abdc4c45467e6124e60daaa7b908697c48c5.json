REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi\n\nTurkey is facing threats of possible sanctions from the United States unless it calls off the incursion, while the Arab League has denounced the operation and NATO allies Germany and France said they were halting weapons exports to Turkey.\n\nAnkara launched the cross-border assault against the YPG militia after U.S President Donald Trump withdrew some U.S. troops from the border region. Turkey says the YPG is a terrorist group aligned with Kurdish militants in Turkey.\n\nGunfire resounded early on Sunday around Ras al Ain, one of two Syrian towns which are the focus of the attack, while Turkish artillery continued to target the area, a Reuters reporter across the border in the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar said.\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian rebels advanced into Ras al Ain on Saturday. Turkey has said it took control of the town center, while Kurdish-led forces denied that and said they were counter-attacking.\n\nAt Tel Abyad, the operation\u2019s other main target some 120 km (75 miles) to the west, Turkish howitzers shelled outlying districts, a witness in the neighboring Turkish town of Akcakale said.\n\nThe assault has raised international alarm over its mass displacement of civilians and the possibility of Islamic State militants escaping from Kurdish prisons.\n\nIn the latest criticism, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the offensive to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, saying it may worsen the humanitarian situation and undermine progress against Islamic State.\n\n\u201cHe urged the President to end the operation and enter into dialogue,\u201d a spokesman for Johnson said after the telephone call between the two leaders on Saturday evening.\n\nTurkey\u2019s Defence Ministry said on Sunday that 480 YPG militants had been \u201cneutralised\u201d since the operation began, a term that commonly means killed.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organization which reports on the war, said 74 Kurdish-led fighters, 49 Turkey-backed Syrian rebels and 30 civilians have been killed in the fighting.\n\nIn Turkey, 18 civilians have been killed in cross-border bombardment, Turkish media and officials say.\n\nFor a graphic on 'Where Kurds live', click here\n\nTRUMP DEFENDS DECISION\n\nPresident Trump on Saturday defended his decision to withdraw troops from the Syrian border region, telling conservative Christian activists that the United States should prioritize protecting its own borders.\n\n\u201cLet them have their borders, but I don\u2019t think our soldiers should be there for the next 50 years guarding a border between Turkey and Syria when we can\u2019t guard our own borders at home,\u201d Trump said in a speech in Washington.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget: they are fighting for their land. They haven\u2019t help us fight for our land,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting for their land and that\u2019s good, but we\u2019ve helped them.\u201d\n\nThe Kurdish-led administration in Syria\u2019s northeast has said nearly 200,000 people had been uprooted so far by the fighting, while the U.N. World Food Programme said more than 100,000 had left Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad.\n\nTurkey\u2019s stated objective is to set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria to resettle many of the 3.6 million Syrian war refugees it has been hosting. Erdogan has threatened to send them to Europe if the EU does not back his assault.\n\nHe has also dismissed the growing condemnation of the operation, saying that Turkey \u201cwill not stop it, no matter what anyone says\u201d.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in which the YPG comprises the main fighting element, holds most of the northern Syrian territory that once made up Islamic State\u2019s \u201ccaliphate\u201d in the country.\n\nThe SDF has been keeping thousands of fighters from the jihadist group in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a car bomb on Friday in Qamishli, the largest city in the Kurdish-held area, where some IS militants fled from a jail.\n\nThe SDF accused Turkey-backed rebel fighters of killing a Kurdish politician in a road ambush on Saturday. The rebel force denied it, saying it had not advanced that far.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory said Turkey-backed groups had killed nine civilians on the road, including Hervin Khalaf, co-chair of the secular Future Syria Party.\n\nFor a graphic on 'Turkey hits Kurdish militia targets' click here", "description": "Turkish forces targeted areas around two Syrian border towns with fresh shelling on Sunday, pressing on with their offensive against Kurdish militia for a fifth day in the face of fierce international opposition.", "authors": ["Daren Butler", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440303408&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C06K-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
