Yet instead of taking steps to clean up their act, they are now ramping up prices at renewal while they can get away with it.\n\nIn one outrageous case, Money Mail reader John Wilson, who lives in a quiet area, this year saw his home insurance bill rise from just under \u00a3313 to \u00a31,119 \u2014 despite him making no claims since 2012.\n\nWhat's most worrying is that if John had missed the renewal letter from his insurer, the firm would have automatically rolled over his cover.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority should come down on insurers like a ton of bricks.\n\nIts final report is not due to be published until next year, but it's clear we cannot afford to wait until then for action. Loyal customers need protecting now.\n\nDon't bank on it...\n\nWhile we're on the topic of businesses letting down customers, Barclays' decision to stop savers withdrawing cash at their local post office is simply disgraceful.\n\nBritain is in real danger of sleepwalking into a cashless society within the next 15 years.\n\nThe last thing we need is a major bank reducing the number of places we can access money, particularly as post offices have been promoted as a solution to banking 'deserts'.\n\nBarclays has, at least, pledged not to shut any more branches for the next two years. But it has shut a third of its network in five years \u2014 so this will be little comfort.\n\nIf I were a Barclays customer, I'd seriously be considering switching to a bank that isn't so intent on prioritising profit margins over basic service \u2014 27 other banks are happy for customers to withdraw cash at a post office.\n\nPension freedom\n\nGreat news for thousands of savers trapped in annuity contracts paying paltry sums for life.\n\nSome 75,000 retirees have finally been offered the chance to cash in their pots and take their pension back as a meaningful lump sum.\n\nFor years, insurers said that it couldn't be done: it was too risky and their 'systems' didn't allow it.\n\nBut, as we reveal here, this just wasn't true. However, the fight is not over, and Money Mail's Unlock Our Pensions campaign will continue until we win a victory for everyone.\n\nIf you're stuck with an annuity you want rid of, write to us at moneymail@dailymail.co.uk or Money Mail, Northcliffe House, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT.\n\nMeters parked\n\nLooks like the smart meter rollout faces another stumbling block.\n\nOne Money Mail reader told us that, after taking the morning off work to have a meter fitted, he received a call to say the engineer could not attend as there was no free parking near the property.\n\nHe adds: 'Imagine my shock when the Npower engineer pulled up outside and explained he could not conduct the install as he had no permission or budget to pay for parking.'\n\nIs it really any wonder that the national rollout is so far behind?\n\nv.bischoff@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "It beggars belief that insurers think they can get away with nearly quadrupling home insurance premiums without good reason.
