Mr. Trump won the state narrowly in 2016, but is trailing Democratic front-runner Joseph R. Biden by about 10 percentage points in polls of head-to-head matchups.\n\nAt a campaign appearance in his native Scranton this week, Mr. Biden accused the president of having forgotten America\u2019s \u201cforgotten people.\u201d The president said his plans will bring even more jobs to the energy-rich landscape of Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to bring 100,000 energy jobs to Appalachia and to rebuild this magnificent region \u2026 which was forgotten too long by the Democrats,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president warned that Democrats\u2019 energy agenda would roll back the gains from shale gas drilling, and would \u201cobliterate millions of American jobs, devastating communities across Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as I am your president, that will never, ever come close to happening,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cOur vision is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-energy and 100 percent pro-American.\u201d\n\nNoting that the U.S. is now a net exporter of energy, the president said America \u201cshould never again be at the mercy of a foreign energy supplier.\u201d Instead, he said, the U.S. should keep growing to \u201cdominance\u201d of world energy markets.\n\n\u201cThe path to that future starts right here in shale country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president listed his achievements on energy, including approving permits for long-stalled oil pipelines, cutting regulations that threatened the coal industry, canceling the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d and withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate accord.\n\n\u201cThe Paris Accord would have been shutting down American producers with excessive regulatory restrictions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we won\u2019t do is punish the American people while enriching foreign polluters. It\u2019s called \u2014 I\u2019m proud to say it \u2014 \u2018America First.\u2019 My job is to represent the people of Pittsburgh, not the people of Paris.\u201d\n\nThe president is expected to move forward with the process of officially withdrawing from the Paris accord by submitting a letter on Nov. 4 to the United Nations, the earliest date he can start a one-year clock to formally withdraw the U.S. from the global climate pact. Withdrawing takes one year.\n\n\u201cI promised as president that I\u2019d unleash American energy like never before because our natural resources do not belong to the government, they belong to the people,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cToday I\u2019m proud to declare that I\u2019ve delivered on every single promise I made to this conference three years ago and much, much more. We\u2019re now energy-independent. We\u2019ve ended the war on American energy, and we\u2019ve ended the economic assault on our wonderful energy workers.\u201d\n\nThe president also cited accomplishments such as his border wall, which he mistakenly said includes a section in Colorado, drawing laughs from some in the audience.\n\nHis speech was interrupted for about three minutes by several protesters whose message was not clear.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pay attention, don\u2019t pay attention,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt them, don\u2019t hurt them, please,\u201d he quickly added. \u201cThey don\u2019t know they\u2019re dealing with very tough people.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo home to mom,\u201d the president said as the protesters were leaving.\n\nMr. Trump also referred several times to the impeachment furor in Washington, complaining that Democrats are \u201cvicious but they stick together\u201d while Republicans aren\u2019t as unified.\n\n\u201cWe got to stick together, right?\u201d he asked the crowd.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
