That image \u2014 which reveals the supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy M87, about 54 million light-years away \u2014 was the result of more than 10 years of planning and work.\n\nThe EHT works by using a group of radio observatories that coordinate their observations over the course of a night, taking meticulous care to look at the same part of the sky.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: The EHT is now working on adding 2 more telescopes to its collaboration of radio observatories by next year, and the scientists behind the project plan to find a way to image Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the center of our galaxy.\n\nDoeleman said that the team is also hoping to image the magnetic fields around black holes to learn more about their structures and basic natures.\n\n\"That is going to be a whole new ball game, as they say. That's going to allow us to really study how black holes eat and how they digest all the matter that's funneling into them,\" Doeleman told Axios in an interview.\n\nThe EHT collaboration won a $3 million Breakthrough Prize last week for its work to image a black hole for the first time.", "description": "Videos can help drill into the details of how black holes consume matter and affect the galaxies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/c-Jd7iB88PxbcxJIwG-cMccfOYk=/0x0:1280x720/1920x1080/2019/09/10/1568141662126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
