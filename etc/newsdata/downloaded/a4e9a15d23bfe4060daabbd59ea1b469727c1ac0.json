The programming began, appropriately enough, in a darkened, candlelit room. With a few simple props, the English actor Robert Lloyd Parry performed two of M.R. James\u2019s most chilling \u201cghost stories of an antiquary\u201d: \u201cThe Ash-Tree\u201d and \u201c \u2018Oh, Whistle and I\u2019ll Come to You, My Lad.\u2019 \u201d Afterward, Parry told me that he had 10 of James\u2019s tales of demons and revenants in his repertoire \u2014 his own favorite being \u201cCanon Alberic\u2019s Scrap-Book\u201d \u2014 and was currently memorizing his 11th and 12th. If you ever have a chance to see his one-man show, don\u2019t miss it, though DVDs of his performances are available through Nunkie Productions.\n\nWay too early on Friday I hurried to the Omni, having agreed to join two morning panels. The first focused on Welsh writer Arthur Machen, whose complete fiction Hippocampus Press has just issued in three hefty volumes. In his finest work, Machen blends the sinister and numinous, most unforgettably in \u201cThe White People,\u201d the first-\n\nperson account of an adolescent girl drawn inexorably into an evil, yet strangely magical Other World. Lovecraft maintained that this chilling story and Algernon Blackwood\u2019s \u201cThe Willows\u201d were the two supreme masterpieces of cosmic horror.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn praise of pretty books\n\nFollowing the Machen panel came \u201cSongs the Sandman Sings: The Legacy and Influence of E.T.A. Hoffmann.\u201d An early-19th-century German pioneer of the weird tale, Hoffmann created characters who are pulled back and forth between the world of the everyday and realms of dream or nightmare. His stories later inspired Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cThe Nutcracker,\u201d Offenbach\u2019s opera \u201cTales of Hoffmann\u201d and much of Freud\u2019s essay \u201cThe Uncanny.\u201d While I spoke briefly about \u201cThe Sandman\u201d and that phantasmagoric mind-boggler \u201cThe Golden Pot,\u201d one of the con\u2019s seven guests of honor, Sonya Taaffe, dazzled with her insights into Hoffmann\u2019s influence on contemporary film.\n\nBecause NecronomiCon runs a half dozen simultaneous tracks, you can\u2019t help but miss wonderful-sounding panels and events. On Friday alone I would have liked to have heard \u201cUnsung Authors,\u201d \u201cPulp History,\u201d \u201cProvidence in Weird Fiction,\u201d \u201cChildren\u2019s Horror Anthologies of the 1960s and 70s,\u201d and a discussion of the lushly decadent fantasist Tanith Lee, which featured, among others, her bibliographer Allison Rich, science fiction writer and critic Paul Di Filippo and popular Washington author Craig Laurance Gidney.\n\nStill, along with my friend Robert Knowlton \u2014 a Toronto book collector who has read more weird fiction than anyone else alive \u2014 I did catch the program devoted to the specialty publisher Arkham House. Its participants included Donald Sidney-Fryer, who in his youth got to know that most poetical of Weird Tales writers, Clark Ashton Smith. Donaldo, as he likes to be called, generously inscribed my copy of \u201cThe Sorcerer Departs,\u201d his memoir of that friendship. Not surprisingly, among the many films shown during the con was Darin Coelho Spring\u2019s superb documentary \u201cClark Ashton Smith: The Emperor of Dreams.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTwo outstanding panels were moderated by prominent Washington scholars of the weird. \u201cPost-Lovecraftian Cosmic Horror\u201d was led by Douglas E. Winter, author of books on Stephen King and Clive Barker and editor of the groundbreaking anthology \u201cPrime Evil.\u201d Later that afternoon, Rusty Burke \u2014 president of the Robert E. Howard Foundation, which honors the creator of Conan of Cimmeria \u2014 oversaw \u201cEldritch Excavations: Weird Archaeology and the Mythos Writers.\u201d In a mesmerizing slide-show, archaeologist Jeffrey H. Shanks surveyed the use of ancient ruins and lost civilizations in horror fiction and crackpot scholarship.\n\nAfter touring the bustling merchants\u2019 room, I bought two NecronomiCon prints from their creator, Dean Kuhta, who lives in Richmond, as well as \u2014 I couldn\u2019t resist \u2014 a \u201cMake Cthulhu Great Again\u201d button. For the uninitiated, Cthulhu is the most powerful and loathsome of Lovecraft\u2019s demonic aliens. I also acquired \u201cThe Chronology Out of Time: Dates in the Fiction of H.P. Lovecraft\u201d by another guest of honor, Peter Cannon, author of that notorious mash-up of Lovecraft and P.G. Wodehouse, \u201cScream for Jeeves.\u201d\n\nJohnston McCulley dreamed up Zorro 100 years ago. The masked avenger is still a thrill.\n\nLate Friday night I groggily meandered into the \u201cDreaming in Carcosa\u201d masquerade ball, named for an imaginary city in Robert W. Chambers\u2019s \u201cThe King in Yellow.\u201d If you\u2019ve never read this melancholy and terrifying 1895 classic, seek out publisher Arc Dream Publishing\u2019s new edition with annotations by yet another NecronomiCon guest of honor, Kenneth Hite, and haunting illustrations by Samuel Araya. At the ball itself Victorian explorers, steampunk aeronauts and Edwardian courtesans, as well gender indeterminate figures wearing antlers, long commedia dell\u2019arte noses and yellow feathers, danced the night away to the eerie, pagan music of Alec K. Redfearn and the Eyesores.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd so closed the first full day of NecronomiCon. Saturday and Sunday brought just as much fun, what with a panel on shrunken heads in popular culture, programs devoted to Edward Gorey and Japanese writer Edogawa Rampo, a discussion of weird fiction from the African diaspora \u2014 featuring still another guest of honor, Victor LaValle \u2014 and the launch of Les Klinger\u2019s \u201cNew Annotated H.P. Lovecraft: Beyond Arkham.\u201d And did I mention the author readings and the art show?\n\nAnyone who attended NecronomiCon 2019 will certainly agree: Cthulhu really should have arisen from the ocean depths, where he lies dreaming and waiting, for \u2014 in Providence, this August \u2014 the stars were right again.\n\nMichael Dirda reviews books each Thursday in Style.\n\nESSAY\n\nAD", "description": "Scenes from NecronomiCon, an event that celebrates the work of H.P.
