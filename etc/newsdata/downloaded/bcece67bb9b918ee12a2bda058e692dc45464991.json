While the report notes an improved link between pay, grade and responsibility, as well as advances in gender balance, it points to challenges arising from the reforms.\n\n\u201cSavings generated from the 2014 staff reforms go beyond expectations, but they are overshadowed by their impact on the workforce,\u201d said Pietro Russo, the member of the European Court of Auditors responsible for the report. \u201cThe HR implications of the cost-saving measures were not without negative consequences.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the report found that changes in working conditions \u201chave reduced the relative attractiveness of working for the EU to some nationalities that are already under-represented.\u201d\n\nWhile the report notes an improved link between pay, grade and responsibility, as well as advances in gender balance, it points to challenges arising from the reforms.\n\nThe auditors found Belgians are most represented in the Commission, while British and German citizens are least represented among EU employees. Polish nationals are underrepresented in intermediate and higher grades, while Spanish, French and Dutch employees are underrepresented in intermediate grades.\n\nThe auditors noted that following the implementation of the reforms, \u201csurveys show a decline in the overall perception of the Commission as an organisation that cares about staff well-being,\u201d and that \u201calmost one third of Commission staff feel that they have an unacceptable workload.\u201d\n\nThe reforms have contributed to an increase in the proportion of contract staff from 20 percent to 24 percent, while the proportion of official and temporary staff has declined.\n\nThey also contributed to an aging Commission workforce, with the auditors noting that the Commission \u201cmay need to update its policies for training, well-being, career development and knowledge management.\u201d\n\nThe auditors noted that the overall sickness rate in the Commission has increased between 2012 and 2017, most markedly in the Commission's Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers, where the average sick leave days per person increased from 10.3 days on average in 2013-2015 to 18.9 in 2017.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s coverage of the EU budget, tracking the development of the seven-year Multiannual Financial Framework.
