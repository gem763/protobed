Guatemala\u2019s president-elect, Alejandro Giammattei, has criticized the deal, but Trump officials reiterated this month that the United States will slash government assistance if Guatemala backs out.\n\nKevin McAleenan, who plans to step down as acting DHS secretary as soon as Thursday, has secured similar agreements with Honduras and El Salvador, but those deals have not been implemented. Mc\u00adAleenan has said the agreements will be implemented gradually to avoid overwhelming Central American nations that until now have typically received few asylum applications from those fleeing persecution.\n\nMcAleenan has argued that vulnerable migrants should not have to travel all the way to the United States to find safety, and that the U.S. immigration system has been overwhelmed in recent years amid a flood of applications from Central American economic migrants making humanitarian claims to avoid deportation.\n\nCritics of the accords say it is unrealistic to expect weak Central American governments to safely resettle vulnerable groups when they already struggle with widespread poverty and some of the world\u2019s highest homicide rates.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump administration has pledged at least $47 million to build up Guatemala\u2019s asylum system with help from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nPresident Trump suspended aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador this spring amid a record surge of families from those nations traveling to the border in large groups and caravans. He announced that he would restore some of the assistance this month after the three countries agreed to accept U.S. asylum seekers.\n\n\u201cGuatemala, Honduras & El Salvador have all signed historic Asylum Cooperation Agreements and are working to end the scourge of human smuggling,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nU.S. authorities took nearly 1 million migrants into custody along the Mexico border during the 2019 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the highest total since 2007. Unauthorized border crossings peaked at more than 144,000 in May but have since declined by two-thirds. Migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador has fallen by more than 80 percent, according to the latest statistics.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTwo administration officials with knowledge of the Guatemala accord said Homeland Security probably would start sending some asylum seekers from Honduras and El Salvador back to Guatemala, beginning with single adults rather than families.\n\nTrump has referred to the asylum agreements and other new deterrent policies as a \u201cbeautiful puzzle\u201d with the overarching goal of discouraging migrants from trying to reach the United States in the first place.\n\nDHS officials also have been requiring asylum seekers to remain outside U.S. territory while they await immigration court hearings under a program \u2014 known as the \u201cMigrant Protection Protocols\u201d \u2014 that has sent more than 50,000 people back to Mexican border cities while their U.S. claims are pending.\n\nAnother emergency measure gives U.S. authorities the ability to disqualify and deport asylum seekers who decline to seek protection in other countries while en route to the United States.\n\nBoth policies are being challenged in federal court, and a ruling on the protocols program in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit is expected soon.\n\nAD", "description": "Homeland Security officials are preparing to implement the \u201casylum cooperation\u201d deal they reached in July.", "authors": ["Nick Miroff", "Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1pOmW-YYteT4WVQag7rVGnif3t4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WXFPKBV26YI6TDUDJZTIP2MYCQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
