Thank you for watching today and over the decades,\" the 55-year-old anchor continued. \"It\u2019s been an honor and my pleasure. Even in our currently polarized nation, it\u2019s my hope that the facts will win the day, that the truth will always matter, and that journalism and journalists will thrive.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFox News also issued a statement from Jay Wallace, president and executive editor of Fox News Media, announcing Smith's departure, saying he would step down as chief news anchor and managing editor of the network's breaking news unit.\n\n\u201cRecently I asked the company to allow me to leave FOX News and begin a new chapter. After requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged,\" Smith said in a statement released by the network.\n\n\"The opportunities afforded this guy from small town Mississippi have been many. It\u2019s been an honor and a privilege to report the news each day to our loyal audience in context and with perspective, without fear or favor.

MORE, after a guest, former U.S. attorney Joe diGenova, called Napolitano \"a fool.\"\n\n\"Attacking our colleague, who\u2019s here to offer legal assessments on our air, in our work home, is repugnant,\" Smith said on the air.\n\nCarlson later that night mockingly quipped, \"repugnant\" after playing back Smith's comment.\n\n\"Not clear if that was you or me but someone was repugnant,\" he said, adding that Smith \"ironically\" called diGenova \"partisan.\"\n\nTrump reacted with surprise to the news of Smith's departure.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.

While this day is especially difficult as his former producer, we respect his decision and are deeply grateful for his immense contributions to the entire network.\u201d\n\nSmith said on his program on Friday that \"under our agreement I won\u2019t be reporting elsewhere, at least in the near future,\" adding, \"But I will be able to see more of ... our friends and family, then we\u2019ll see what comes along.\"", "description": "Longtime Fox News host Shepard Smith is leaving the network after 23 years, saying he plans to \"begin a new chapter.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/smithshepard_101718fox.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
