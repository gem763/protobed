Thanks very much. Let's bring in Dan Abrams for it's hard to wrap your arms around all this but Cecilia said in the intro, clearly illegal to solicit any foreign help. Beyond that it's kind of a classic impeachable offense one contemplated by the framers. We're not just talking about requesting some sort of aid from a country. We're talking about China. This comes on the heels of the president congratulating China on the 70s anniversary of communism, and this is a country where you're in the middle of trade talk, right? The allegation in Ukraine is, held up funds in exchange for promises about investigation of Biden. Now they're involved in trade talks with China and, again, it makes you have to ask the question, is it connected in some way, shape or form to any of the negotiations? But when you take a step back and you say, the president of the United States is requesting China and Ukraine to investigate the former vice president of the United States, right, put aside the politics for a moment. The former vice president of the United States, right. He's asking China and Ukraine to investigate him, not based on something where the president is saying here's the evidence we have, he's saying, please find me the evidence, please help -- please help me find something here that I can potentially use because the problem right now and let's it back to the Bidens for a second, there is no evidence of Joe Biden engaging in wrongdoing in Ukraine or in China. You can talk about whether hunter Biden should have been on the board or shouldn't have been on the board, et cetera, that's a separate question from do they have evidence against Joe Biden. And a separate question from is it on its face an abuse of power to invite foreign interference in our election. This is what they seem to be saying that wasn't true about the whistle-blower. Now the president is effectively confirming what the whistle-blower said, you don't even need the whistle-blower once you have these texts and this statement, you've got what the whistle-blower was alleging. Dan Abrams, thanks very much.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "ABC News\u2019 Dan Abrams analyzes whether President Trump\u2019s comments on China and the Bidens are part of an impeachment defense strategy.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191004_gma_abrams1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
