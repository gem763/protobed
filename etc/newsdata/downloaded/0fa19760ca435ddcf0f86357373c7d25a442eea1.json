We both love the author Lemn Sissay, who himself went through the foster system. We\u2019ve even been to Cheltenham Festival together to see him in conversation with the Scottish poet Jackie Kay, who was adopted.\n\nAs we came out of the packed hall, Jordan said: \u2018Mum, it\u2019s really brilliant because I\u2019m the person in that room who can identify with the people on stage\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have been astounded by the resilience that Jordan and many other adopted children have, and their determination to make the best out of life.\n\nTheir ability to understand what has happened to them and to carry the weight of that as a child is humbling. Jordan has been just as focused at making our relationship work as I have been, he is as invested in me as I am in him.\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve both had our challenges along the way.\n\nThe adoption process wasn\u2019t difficult, but understandably took some time and involved a lot of thought about who I was, what I had to offer and what difficulties I might face. It was mentally challenging \u2013 it\u2019s not like a Disney film.\n\nMy first meeting with Jordan was very frightening, for both us, but the two-week plan of introductions organised by the agency was superb. At all times, they were conscious of what was best for the child and for me.\n\nAdoptive parents like myself have no comprehension of what our children have been through.\n\nFor the first few years, Jordan was very scared and took his time in deciding whether to trust me. It took him two years to start calling me \u2018mum\u2019, which was hard to deal with, but ultimately worth the wait because I knew it was genuine.\n\nSometimes the financial situation and the relentlessness of solo parenting can be hard, but it has brought us closer together \u2013 we are a team of two \u2013 but just because you are a single parent, it doesn\u2019t mean you are alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSingle adoptive parents shouldn\u2019t feel afraid to ask for help, I do it all the time and I\u2019m a better parent for it.\n\nWhen Jordan turned 11, I attended the \u2018Stop\u2019 parenting programme run by Coram for parents of teenagers and the techniques I learned have been invaluable. They allowed me to understand my son better than some of my friends who have birth children.\n\nWe set up a group for those who attended the course and we still meet every four months, even though our children are now all approaching 18.\n\nOne of the most rewarding aspects of adopting Jordan has been seeing his life aspirations expand before my eyes.\n\nFor the first three or four years, whenever I asked him about his future goals, Jordan would say that he wanted a job as a cleaner. Now he\u2019s at college training to become a paramedic.\n\nHe also passed seven out of his eight GCSEs and told me: \u2018Mum, that\u2019s better than anyone else in my family has done before\u2019.\n\nFor my son to be the first-ever in his birth family to get GCSEs felt like him being the first man on the moon \u2013 it was an amazing achievement.\n\nJordan wasn\u2019t the only one who was transformed by the adoption. I have gone through immense personal growth and change as an adoptive parent.\n\nI have become a much more patient and empathetic person, something that has also paid dividends in my professional life.\n\nIf Jordan comes to me, I will stop whatever I am doing and listen to him \u2013 being fully present for your child is the most powerful gift you can give them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou are showing them that they matter and that they are loved, and I really underestimated the power of what being loved actually means to a child.\n\nThe scale of my love for my son and the security it provides empowers him to live his life.\n\nJordan has faced some difficult challenges from his childhood, and he will carry them with him for life, but I have no doubt that he will have a happy and fulfilling future.\n\nHe is his own person and he believes in himself.\n\nTo others thinking of adopting I would say: do it!\n\nIt has far exceeded my expectations. I think it\u2019s better than having a birth child, I could never have produced someone as wonderful as my son.\n\nHe\u2019s just a really great person \u2013 everyone should have a Jordan!\n\nCoram Ambitious for Adoption is keen to speak to anyone in London and surrounding areas interested in becoming adopters.\n\nMORE: The best thing my family ever did, along with having our sons, was adopt our daughter\n\nMORE: Incredible foster mum teaches the black children she cares for about their heritage and culture\n\nMORE: Lydia Bright opens up about her future plans to foster children like her own parents did\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Sophie shares the story of how adopting her son Jordan has enriched her life and how loving him has transformed both of their lives.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/download-2-43a0_1571390371.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
