Markets are inherently human (for now) and so behaviour through a cycle tends to be consistent, even if the actors change. It is this changing of actors that sees behaviour repeat as per Jim Grant's great quote, \"progress is cumulative in science and engineering, but cyclical in finance\".\n\nParticularly of note in 2019 is the increased \u201cfraying\u201d of the technology narrative that has driven this long great bull market.\n\nConsider the increasing public market rejection of private market valuations; 2019 has seen a rush of IPOs from private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC). The nature of PE and VC investing is these assets have to be sold, either via IPO or trade sale. In prior years, IPOs such as Facebook and Alibaba soared.\n\nYet this year Uber is trading well below its float price and the failed WeWork float has all the hallmarks of a future Harvard Business School case study. Pets.com anyone?\n\nIf we look at our market, Australians have rejected the Latitude float (for the second time) and now PropertyGuru has been pulled as well to go with Retail Zoo and MPC Kinetic.\n\nWe also observe the increasingly \u201cskewed\u201d response of tech stocks in Australia to bad news. In the last few weeks, both Wisetech and iSignthis shares have been suspended from trading, for different reasons. Both were market darlings in the local tech space and may yet recover, but note the way they fell more swiftly than before. This increased two-way price action, is late cycle stuff.\n\nThen there is the \u201cdeath of style X\u201d. In the late 1990s you couldn\u2019t give away BHP shares, such was the disdain for commodities. In 2002, Gordon Brown famously sold the UK's gold reserves for $US275 an ounce, marking the low in the gold price. In 2006, the story was \u201cthe end of large cap US investing\u201d, with everyone chasing Asian growth. Today, it\u2019s \u201cthe end of value investing\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLastly there is the increased funding to private markets and VC who are already having a hard time getting away those old deals. Whilst this is not a comment on the merits of allocating to these strategies, there has historically been a pro-cyclical allocation pattern from pension funds, with 2007 seeing a peak of $US762 billion in buyouts, with the lows of $101 billion in ... 2009. Yes, the very year that one should have been allocating to the surplus of cheap assets around the world, allocators shied away.\n\nInstead there is a now a rush to allocate in 2019.\n\nSo, is it the very end? Sorry to disappoint, but probably not yet. It usually gets really, really silly at the end. This is more like 1998. I haven\u2019t had an Uber driver say he\u2019s started a VC business as a side-hustle and with interest rates this low, it\u2019s hard for businesses to default.\n\nThen again WeWork is setting new standards as a place where money goes to die for no good reason.\n\nReeled from the sabre stroke, Shattered and sundered. Then they rode back, but not Not the six hundred (from Alfred Lord Tennyson's The Charge of The Light Brigade).\n\nChad Slater is the joint chief investment officer of Morphic Asset Management.", "description": "Quantitative and qualitative signals are starting to weaken, does this finally mean we have arrived at the end of the cycle?
