Oh no.\n\n\n\nLike almost everything else, toothpaste is going craft, and there\u2019s a tube of the stuff on Takealot for nearly R2,000, but you\u2019re going to have to find fluoride elsewhere.\n\nIf you like the finer things in life, Takealot can organise you a tube of the world\u2019s most expensive tooth cleaner, Theodent 300 for R1,990, marked down, surprise, surprise from R3,950, probably because no-one was buying it. There\u2019s free delivery, and if you want to buy it on credit, it will cost you R185/month over 12 months, which takes the price to R2,220.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes with its own review: \u201cDespite its power, Theodent 300 is also non-toxic, not harmful if swallowed, and safe for paediatric use (particularly in cases of enamel hypoplasia (thinning enamel). Theodent 300 also contains Crystal Whitening Mint to give your teeth the pearly white look your teeth deserve.\u201d\n\n\n\nTheodent 300 is listed as the world\u2019s most expensive toothpaste. There is a budget version for just under R500 and a chocolate one for kids.\n\n\n\nTurns out there\u2019s a range of expensive toothpastes available in SA. So, if you are not happy with the stuff made by the multinationals, there are a host of choices available locally. Some contain charcoal, others bamboo, some with fluoride and some without.\n\n\n\nA recent story on Bloomberg quoted the American Dental Association as saying toothpaste has little impact on cleaning teeth, and that the real benefit comes from the action of the bristles scraping plaque off the tooth surface. They do stress the usefulness of fluoride though in helping repair the earliest stages of tooth decay, which begs the question why some of the world\u2019s most expensive pastes don\u2019t have it as an ingredient.\n\n\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the global toothpaste market is worth about $26 billion (about R383 billion) and could reach $36 billion (R531 billion) by 2024. With celebrities like Lenny Kravitz getting in on the action and ingredients as varied as sea buckthorn, to relieve gum aggravation and cardamom and wasabi for fresh breath, the industry has gone mad.\n\n\n\nTakealot has 30 pages of toothpaste options, including a bulk pack of 24 X 75ml tubes of Oral B - probably enough for five years of twice-a-day brushing for R718 - about R30 a tube. And it\u2019s minty. And has fluoride. Just the way the stuff is meant to be.\n\n\n\nSave the charcoal for the Wales game.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here\n\n\n\nAlso from Bruce Whitfield:", "description": "Theodent 300 is listed as the world\u2019s most expensive toothpaste.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7694/262918689128441f9d8fc0c1a621795e.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
