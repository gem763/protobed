But it comes amid intensified negotiations aimed at securing congressional approval of the updated trade deal. There have been multiple meetings in recent weeks between Neal\u2019s working group of House Democrats, and Trump administration officials led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have really narrowed our differences considerably,\u201d Neal said after meeting with Lighthizer in the Capitol this week.\n\n\u201cAfter long experience with this I know how you can wrap things up all of a sudden,\u201d Neal added.\n\nThe support of organized labor will be crucial to bringing many Democrats on board. Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO, the nation\u2019s largest labor federation, said in an interview Thursday that negotiations were \u201cmoving in the right direction\u201d but that important differences remained on issues including enforcement of fair labor standards. Trumka also said that the addition of the Butch Lewis Act, which he supports, would not be enough on its own to win AFL-CIO backing for a trade deal that does not meet their standards.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take a bad bill and try to hide it with another bill and expect people to think it\u2019s good,\u201d Trumka said.\n\nAD\n\nThe negotiations are proceeding in a Capitol consumed by the impeachment inquiry of Trump, which has contributed to growing GOP frustration with House Democrats over their failure to wrap up talks. Some in the Trump administration and the business community have pushed for a House vote by Thanksgiving, a timeline that looks implausible, although some still hold out hope for a handshake agreement by then. The growing fear among some supporters of the deal is that with impeachment looming, the trade pact will get delayed until 2020 and then derailed entirely by election-year politics.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) alleged on the Senate floor Thursday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has put the trade deal \u201con ice in order to move the Democrats\u2019 impeachment obsession to the front burner.\u201d A Pelosi spokesman, Henry Connelly, responded that \u201cMcConnell would prefer to rush through a USMCA draft that locks in high drug prices and lacks the enforcement needed to actually protect American workers and farmers, but that\u2019s not good enough for Democrats.\u201d USMCA is the acronym for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the name of the new trade deal.\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, some of the political dynamics around the deal have begun to shift in unpredictable ways. Rewriting NAFTA was one of Trump\u2019s major campaign promises, so by striking a deal to do so Democrats would be delivering Trump a major win heading into 2020. Many Democrats say it\u2019s worth it if they can negotiate a better version of NAFTA, which many blame for lowering American wages and sending jobs overseas. The Democratic presidential field includes free-trade skeptics, but with impeachment under way, Democrats are motivated to show they can still achieve legislative accomplishments. Pelosi has spoken repeatedly of wanting to \u201cget to yes\u201d on the deal, though without committing to a timetable.\n\nAD\n\nTrump himself tweeted earlier this week: \u201cCan\u2019t believe that Nervous Nancy Pelosi isn\u2019t moving faster on USMCA. Her people want it, they don\u2019t know why she isn\u2019t putting it up for a bipartisan vote. Taking too long!\u201d\n\nThe initial USMCA deal was signed almost a year ago by Trump and the leaders of Canada and Mexico, but must be ratified by the legislatures in all three countries.\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump administration says the new deal will rebalance North American trade to favor American manufacturing workers by requiring 75 percent of automobile content be produced in North America with up to 45 percent being made by workers making an hourly wage of at least $16.\n\nFour issues have been at the center of the bargaining: labor standards, environmental provisions, the data exclusivity period for a new class of drugs known as biologics and the deal\u2019s enforcement mechanisms.\n\nAD\n\nUSMCA would grant pharmaceutical companies 10 years of protection from generic alternatives to any of their high-priced biologics, which are made from living organisms. That would mean no change in U.S. law, but it would require Canada and Mexico to provide drug makers with more years of monopoly protection than they currently do.\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats have blasted the provision as a giveaway to the pharmaceutical industry. In response to Democrats\u2019 concerns, Lighthizer has proposed tying USMCA\u2019s biologics protection to U.S. law. If Congress shortened the exclusivity period from its current 12 years to something less than the 10 years provided in the trade deal, the text would automatically \u201cratchet\u201d down to reflect the change.\n\nMexico, meanwhile, has scrambled over the last few months to respond to Democrats\u2019 requests for more robust labor reform and enforcement mechanisms. Mexican officials said that when Neal visited Mexico earlier this month, he presented a list of concerns that some Democratic lawmakers still had about the country\u2019s recently revised labor rules. Mexico has recently changed the minimum wage for Mexican workers and its budget to implement the reform.\n\nAD\n\nMexico\u2019s president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, responded with a letter on Oct. 17 aiming to quell Neal\u2019s concerns.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI assure you that this government intends to continue increasing wages by at least two percentage points above the inflation rate each year,\u201d Lopez Obrador wrote.\n\nMexico\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister for North America, Jesus Seade, said the labor ministry\u2019s budget will increase by around 23% to ensure that the labor reform is properly implemented.\n\nBut the Democrats have continued to convey concerns to Mexico about how the labor reform will be enforced. One Democratic proposal was to send inspectors to Mexico to investigate labor standards. That idea was rejected by Mexican officials as an infringement on their sovereignty. Seade is currently working with Lighthizer to create a different enforcement mechanism, Mexican officials said.\n\nLopez Obrador for years railed against NAFTA and free market policies, but has come to embrace the new trade agreement, becoming an important cheerleader for the deal. He also encouraged Mexico\u2019s congress to ratify the deal, which it did in June.\n\n.\n\nAD", "description": "House Democrats are trying to close in on a deal with the Trump administration on a reworked North American trade pact, even as chaos over the impeachment inquiry and Trump foreign policy erupts around them.
