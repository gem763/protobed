And probably they would like to meet and we'll see what happens.\"\n\n\"There was a little correspondence recently, very positive correspondence with North Korea.\"\n\nHe said there had been \"no nuclear testing, there's no missile testing, there's no nothing\".\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
