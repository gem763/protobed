Mr Pan was also removed as an ACPAM director during the EGM.\n\nSubsequently, Mr Wang also stepped down as Pine Capital\u2019s head of Greater China on Aug 19. In his exit interview, he had expressed concerns about the financial positions of ACPAM and Pine Capital\u2019s Shanghai consulting arm.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe management rights of the only fund managed by ACPAM, Advance Credit Fund SPC (ACF), rests with the holder of ACF\u2019s one management share, said Pine Capital on Tuesday.\n\nACPAM\u2019s legal proceedings against Mr Wang and Mr Pan relate to possible mismanagement and the transfer of the one management share in ACF from ACPAM to Mr Wang.\n\nThis transfer was made with the approval of Mr Pan, to the best of Pine Capital\u2019s board\u2019s knowledge.\n\nAs a result of the transfer, ACPAM \u2013 the principal fund and a contributor to Pine Capital\u2019s revenue and earnings \u2013 has no other operating fund.\n\nMr Wang had been one of the two directors of ACF, with the other director being Alauddin Ahmed.\n\nAs part of these legal proceedings, ACPAM has also obtained an interim injunction from the Singapore High Court against Mr Wang and Mr Pan.\n\nThe injunction restrains them from transferring, disposing or otherwise dealing with the one management share in ACF; acting or purporting to act as ACF\u2019s directors, and acting on ACF\u2019s behalf or interfering in the affairs of ACF; exercising any rights as the holder of the one management share; and disposing of, transferring and/or dealing with any of ACF\u2019s assets or properties.\n\nThe court also ordered Mr Wang and Mr Pan to provide a full account of all dealings and transactions carried out by ACF since April 2019.\n\nPine Capital and its legal advisers are \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d the progress of the legal proceedings against both individuals and will update shareholders of further developments, the filing stated.\n\nPine Capital said the transfer of the ACF management share will not have a material impact on the company\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) and net tangible assets per share for the current financial year.\n\nWhile there will be loss of revenue from ACF, the fund was a loss-making activity, and after removing associated costs the net effect on the group\u2019s EPS will be positive but immaterial, Pine Capital noted.\n\nAside from ACPAM, Pine Capital still has an operating business through its consulting arm in China \u2013 Pine Capital (Shanghai) Group \u2013 which has a team working to secure mandates and partnership sales agreements.\n\nLast week, the Singapore Exchange queried Pine Capital on its decision to add two Hong Kong-based directors to its board, David Sarkis and Chan Wai Leung.\n\nTrading in the company's shares has been suspended since March.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - ADVANCE Capital Partners Asset Management (ACPAM), a subsidiary of Catalist-listed Pine Capital Group, has commenced legal proceedings against two former directors. .
