Other people's drama is not my drama.\"\n\nHailey has taken to social media to stick up for her man after the banana video failed to go down well.\n\nPosting a clip of a Taylor fan, the blond beauty wrote: \"I never knew I could make somebody so upset...truly I'm so sorry you're THIS upset?! Lord have mercy I hope I'm never this upset about someone I don't know!!\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nFans could be forgiven for thinking they're still not on good terms - in June this year, Taylor posted a blog post after Scooter, Justin's manager, bought Big Machine Records, which owns most of Taylor's master recordings.\n\nTaylor claimed that that had never been an option for her, and that Scooter of all people owning them was her \"worst case scenario.\"\n\nJustin didn't take well to the post, and replied: \"What were you trying to accomplish by posting that blog?\n\n\"Seems to me like it was to get sympathy u also knew that in posting that your fans would go and bully Scooter.\"\n\nStill, the heartthrob later apologised: \"Hey Taylor. First of all I would like to apologise for posting that hurtful Instagram post, at the time I thought it was funny, but looking back it was hurtful and insensitive.\"", "description": "Justin was filmed outside his recording studio when he told paparazzi that he and Taylor are on good terms despite rumours of bad blood", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Wireimage", "Splash News", "Splashnews.Com", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645243.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_2011-Teen-Choice-Awards-Backstage-And-Audience.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
