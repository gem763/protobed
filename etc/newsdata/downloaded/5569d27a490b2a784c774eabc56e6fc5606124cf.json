Others point to the release of the 1979 Sugarhill Gang song \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight\u201d as the moment when the genre was catapulted into the national consciousness.\n\nBut several years before either of those moments, Rudy Ray Moore was rhyming over a beat. On his 1970 album Eat Out More Often, the comedian, propelled by a backing band, spit profane and slang-laced poems about America\u2019s mystical underbelly of prostitutes, hustlers and thieves \u2014 including one character named Dolemite, a slick-talking, karate-chopping pimp who exposed corrupt officials and defeated seedy rivals.\n\nThis quasi-musical performance of Moore\u2019s recording is dramatized in Dolemite Is My Name, a new film that arrived on Netflix on Friday and stars Eddie Murphy as Moore, who died in 2008. The film traces Moore\u2019s reinvention from struggling comedian and record shop employee to movie star in his own film, Dolemite, which would become a beloved cult favorite in 1975.\n\nBut while the movie faithfully depicts Moore\u2019s rise, it ends before it can explore the primary way he remains influential in modern culture: through hip-hop. At every step of hip-hop\u2019s four-decade history, artists have imitated not only Moore\u2019s rhyming style, but nearly every facet of his act. \u201cAll these things that hip-hop became \u2014 the image, the swag, the independence, the sh-t-talking \u2014 he was it before it was called hip-hop,\u201d the West Coast hip-hop pioneer Too $hort tells TIME.\n\nWhile Moore\u2019s act would be considered decidedly misogynistic today, he put forth an alluring alternative model of success for black men, and his do-it-yourself spirit paved the way for generations of musicians and entrepreneurs. Below, several prominent hip-hop artists from across the decades \u2014 Too $hort, Big Daddy Kane, Del the Funky Homosapien and Luther \u201cUncle Luke\u201d Campbell \u2014 talk about Moore\u2019s impact on their own art.\n\n\u201cHe was the first really to be rapping\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s rapping on Eat Out More Often was a far cry from what hip-hop would become: his words weren\u2019t rhythmically aligned to the music, and the beats were jazzy as opposed to funk-based. But his unique, bombastic delivery on that record \u2014 filled with black vernacular, growling catchphrases, and eye-popping profanity \u2014 set many precedents. His theme song to Dolemite\u2019s 1976 sequel, The Human Tornado, got even closer to rap before it was rap: over a funky breakbeat, Moore crooned a few lines before spitting a rapid-fire, multi-syllabic bar: \u201cI don\u2019t want no dilapidated seep-sapping pigeon-toed, cross-eyed, bow-legged son-of-a-gun messing with me,\u201d he snarls.\n\nWhen Del the Funky Homosapien was a teenager starting his rap career in the early \u201990s in Oakland, he was introduced to Dolemite at a friend\u2019s recording studio and was bowled over by Moore\u2019s verbal prowess. \u201cI was like, \u2018This is wild,\u2019\u201d he told TIME. Intrigued, Del went back through Moore\u2019s discography and realized it contained the blueprint for rap. \u201cI would be studying his monologues \u2014 how to really rap,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was the first really to be rapping damn near like that\u2026 Having people captivated just by how you\u2019re talking. I wanted to see how he was doing it.\u201d\n\nDel would go on to achieve critical acclaim throughout the \u201990s for his tongue-twisting and off-kilter bravado. Meanwhile, another rapper had ascended out of the same city wielding a profane boisterousness: Too $hort. Of all the rapper\u2019s colorful obscenities, he became known for a particular curse word \u2014 \u201db-tch\u201d \u2014 that he delivered in a way not dissimilar to Rudy Ray Moore. Too $hort says this is no accident, given that he saw The Human Tornado \u201cprobably a hundred times.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way on earth I could ever fix my mouth to say I\u2019m not influenced by him,\u201d he says. \u201cPart of the makeover of Too $hort comes from listening to Rudy Ray Moore\u2019s rhythmic cadence, his attitude, the way he curses.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s influence on rapping was not just stylistic but structural. On his records, he weaved long-winded and uproarious narratives about society\u2019s underworld, full of sexcapades and brawls. Curtis Sherrod, the executive director of the Hip Hop Culture Center in Harlem, says that Moore provided a direct link between griots \u2014 West African historians and storytellers \u2014 and more recent hip-hop narratives. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know he was a griot, but it was in his DNA,\u201d Sherrod says. \u201cHe was able to tell stories and captivate audiences who were experiencing oppression and needed to have an hour window into this fable mystery fantastic life he gave you.\u201d\n\nIn the years to come, comedic storytelling that often involved sex and violence, from Slick Rick\u2019s \u201cLa Di Da Di\u201d to Biz Markie\u2019s \u201cThe Vapors\u201d to Snoop Dogg\u2019s \u201cMurder Was the Case,\u201d would become an integral part of hip-hop\u2019s DNA.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to ask for it\u201d\n\nWhen Kanye West rapped \u201cwe never had nothing handed, took nothing for granted\u201d on the opening song to his debut record The College Dropout, he could have been talking about Rudy Ray Moore. Dolemite Is My Name depicts Moore\u2019s struggle to be taken seriously when trying to break into the film industry: he was repeatedly told by executives that his lewd and black-oriented sensibilities were unsuitable for mass consumption. But Moore wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer: he spearheaded Dolemite by fronting the money himself, creating his own distribution networks and learning how to make a movie on the job.\n\nHis dogged self-belief and independence would become a model for future rappers to create their own lanes as opposed to ceding creative control. Early in Too $hort\u2019s career, for example, he sold cassette tapes out of the trunk of his car, formed his own label and forged an alter ego built on unshakeable confidence. He would eventually become a leader of the West Coast sound and a massive seller in the 1990s and 2000s. \u201cHe passed on that entrepreneurial spirit where we don\u2019t have to ask for it, we just do it ourselves,\u201d Too $hort says of Moore. \u201cIn my early days, he was definitely as influential as any rapper.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, the Miami DJ Luther \u201cUncle Luke\u201d Campbell was hoping to ascend in a city that had little hip-hop legacy. Rather than sign to a label, Campbell was inspired by Moore to go it himself and start Luke Records, one of the very first hip-hop labels in the South. \u201cYou watched a Rudy Ray Moore movie and saw he produced it, directed it, marketed his music and did everything else,\u201d Campbell tells TIME. \u201cHe always inspired me to say, \u201cOkay, if Rudy Ray Moore can do it, I can do it.\u201d\n\nAs the leader of 2 Live Crew, Campbell furthered Moore\u2019s legacy through his unhinged bawdiness. 2 Live Crew\u2019s records contained graphic depictions of sex \u2014 and many samples of Moore\u2019s voice \u2014and found a massive audience for a level of obscenity that record labels would have thought unthinkable. 2 Live Crew also proved startlingly important to the future of hip-hop through their involvement in two legal cases related to free speech. In 1990, Luke and other group members were arrested for obscenity charges, but they were eventually acquitted and the charges were overturned on the grounds of free speech. The same year, the group was sued for its interpolation of Roy Orbison\u2019s \u201cOh, Pretty Woman,\u201d with the case going all the way to the Supreme Court. In 1994, the court ruled in favor of 2 Live Crew and set the standard for protecting works of parody.\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Rudy Ray Moore, we would have never done those songs,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cHe has just as much credit for our career and our success as us doing the music.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Pimp Persona\u201d\n\nWhile Moore played many characters, none had an impact as monumental as Dolemite. From The Mack to Superfly to Willie Dynamite, Dolemite arrived amidst a \u201970s renaissance of fictional black pimps who would set a template for countless hip-hop stars. \u201cI loved the pimp persona,\u201d Too $hort says. \u201cHe would kick your ass, and he was about the money. Then he would stop on the street and start rapping to the homies. It\u2019s like, this guy is the ultimate guy.\u201d\n\nIn an era directly following the Watts riots, the Vietnam War and widespread urban rot, the pimp became a mythological figure; a larger-than-life, self-made renegade trying to claim autonomy in an unjust world. \u201cIf the leader of this country is stealing and getting away clean, what the hell are we supposed to do?\u201d one character says in Dolemite, referring to Richard Nixon. Embracing pimp narratives wasn\u2019t just about escapism, but a rebellion against traditional modes of American success.\n\nSo many rappers \u2014 from Snoop Dogg to Ice-T to Big Boi \u2014 adopted the persona, wearing colorful, flashy clothing and wide-brimmed hats. Their demeanor dripped with laidback aplomb. \u201cI studied The Mack and Rudy Ray Moore / They were my idols when I was a kid,\u201d Big Boi rapped on Outkast\u2019s 1994 debut album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. There was Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cBig Pimpin\u2019,\u201d 50 Cent\u2019s \u201cP.I.M.P\u201d, and even this year, Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s \u201cPimpin\u2019,\u201d which flips gender dynamics on their head in its celebration of sex and power.\n\nAnd Dolemite, the archetype for many of these boasts, would be name-dropped over and over throughout the years by countless stars, both an inside joke and an homage. Snoop Dogg, the Wu-Tang Clan, Eazy-E, the Beastie Boys, Lupe Fiasco and A$AP Rocky have all slipped his name in verses, while Moore\u2019s crackling voice has been sampled by Big Sean, Dr. Dre and A Tribe Called Quest.\n\nSeveral rappers even went one step further and brought Moore into the studio with them, using him as a torchbearer and literalizing the lineage between them. On the intro to Busta Rhymes\u2019 2001 album Genesis, Moore implores Busta to \u201ccontinue to give it to \u2018em raw.\u201d On Method Man\u2019s Tical, Moore asserts he \u201ctaught the boy everything he know.\u201d Moore also appears as Dolemite in Eric B and Rakim\u2019s 1990 music video for \u201cIn the Ghetto.\u201d\n\nThat same year, Big Daddy Kane \u2014 one of the biggest rappers at the time \u2014 staged a rap battle between him and a 63-year-old Moore on record. On \u201cBig Daddy vs. Dolemite,\u201d the two engaged in a vulgar game of one-upmanship before Kane conceded defeat. \u201cHe was doing the body shaking and everything,\u201d Kane remembers about that day. \u201cHe went straight into character.\u201d\n\nKane has a long history of engaging with Moore\u2019s work: after watching The Human Tornado on repeat on his tour bus, he sampled a beat for his 1989 song \u201cChildren R The Future\u201d by hooking up the VHS tape straight into his recording equipment. And one of Moore\u2019s quips, \u201cPut your weight on it!,\u201d became the basis of Kane\u2019s 1990 song with the same name. \u201cHe was that raw comedian that stayed raw,\u201d Kane said. \u201cHe was someone I respected and looked at as an icon.\u201d\n\nKane stayed in touch with Moore through the last decade of his life and says that despite all of the respect Moore received from the hip-hop community, he \u201cdied bitter.\u201d \u201cHe died feeling like, \u2018Y\u2019all gives props to Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, Redd Foxx, and they all used to come see me,\u2019\u201d Kane explains.\n\n\u201cTo have someone make a movie about him \u2014 especially a comedic genius like Eddie Murphy \u2014 I know he would be real happy.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Uncle Luke, Too $hort, Del the Funky Homosapien and Big Daddy Kane discuss the influence of comedian Rudy Ray Moore, the subject of Netflix's 'Dolemite Is My Name.'", "authors": ["Andrew R.
