Minutes after midnight early Monday morning, following a loss to the rival New York Yankees, the Boston Red Sox decided they could do better.\n\nThe Red Sox fired Dombrowski as their president of baseball operations with a full season left on his contract, a move that stunned the industry because of its timing\u2014and its ruthlessness. In Dombrowski\u2019s three full years at the helm, the Red Sox claimed division titles in all of them and won more games than any organization in the major leagues.\n\nBut all that success, quite literally, came at a cost.\n\nWith the sport\u2019s labor relations at the lowest point in a quarter-century and unrest over ownership\u2019s perceived unwillingness to compete reaching a fervor, Dombrowski spent lavishly. He signed David Price to a $217 million free-agent deal and gave Chris Sale a $145 million extension. He brought in J.D. Martinez for $110 million and locked up Xander Bogaerts for $120 million. The outside additions joined together with a talented young core already in place and transformed the Red Sox into a juggernaut.\n\nIt also resulted in MLB\u2019s highest payroll in each of the last two seasons and a $12 million luxury-tax bill a year ago. They will cross that threshold again in 2019 at a moment where even the wealthiest franchises appear to prefer the cheaper option of building from within.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS From a financial perspective, was it a good or bad decision to remove Dave Dombrowski after winning the last World Series? Why? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe rings on the fingers of the Red Sox suggest that they reaped an enormous reward for their financial commitment. The boatloads of cash the Red Sox laid out while their competitors opted for austerity directly led to their fourth championship in 15 years, after going close to a century without one.\n\nDombrowski\u2019s brute-force approach, however, put a target on his back when the cracks started showing. After entering this season with aspirations of returning to the World Series, the Red Sox have struggled, emerging as perhaps the biggest disappointment in baseball.\n\nThough their record of 76-67 would put them on the cusp of a playoff berth in the National League, it leaves them out of luck in the top-heavy American League. They currently sit behind the Yankees and Tampa Bay Rays in the AL East and eight games out of a wild-card spot with three weeks remaining.\n\nIn the afterglow of a parade down Boylston Street last fall, the Red Sox didn\u2019t sound too concerned about Dombrowski\u2019s expensive taste and considered it the price of doing business. John Henry, their owner, indicated in February that he expected to soon extend Dombrowski\u2019s contract. In June, Henry\u2019s message changed, telling WEEI.com that the Red Sox \u201cwere substantially over our budget last year and this year.\u201d\n\nNot all of Dombrowski\u2019s gambles worked. Price has pitched well at times, but nowhere near the Cy Young-caliber performance earlier in his career. Sale\u2019s long-term health has turned into a gigantic question mark. Nathan Eovaldi owns a 5.77 ERA in the first year of a $68 million contract.\n\nMeanwhile, the Red Sox face some difficult choices moving forward. Mookie Betts, arguably their best player, will reach free agency after 2020, forcing the Red Sox to either trade him or award him a contract worth upward of $250 million to retain him. Martinez can opt out of his deal this winter, and keeping him would require even more money. The farm system, though improved, still ranks near the bottom of baseball, in part because of Dombrowski\u2019s pursuit of major-league assets at the expense of prospects.\n\nDave Dombrowski, right, and Red Sox manager Alex Cora hoist the American League Championship Trophy in 2018.

He added that they \u201cwere incredibly fortunate\u201d to hire Dombrowski, now 63.\n\nDombrowski, in a text message, admitted that \u201cthis year did not go as we all planned\u201d and said, \u201c[I] respect ownership\u2019s decision to make any changes they choose.\u201d\n\nThe Red Sox will now embark on their next chapter with all eyes on their economics. Will they try to build on what still ranks as one of baseball\u2019s top collection of players? Or will they join so many of their peers and start shedding salary in the name of sustainability?\n\nIn the end, the Red Sox determined that Dombrowski valued the short term over the future too much, even with a championship to show for it. His replacement will need to act more creatively, to thread a needle between winning now and maintaining a payroll more suitable to his bosses.\n\nIn the team\u2019s statement, Red Sox chairman Tom Werner praised Dombrowski for \u201chis willingness to make bold moves.\u201d Those moves brought the Red Sox a title. They also cost him his job.\n\nWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "description": "Dave Dombrowski assembled the team that won last year\u2019s World Series, but was fired by Boston with a full season left on his contract.", "authors": ["Jared Diamond"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105292/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
