They kept the team disciplined, stuck to the game plan, kept attacking where we thought New Zealand were weak and didn't divert from there.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

that brought the stadium alive in a cacophony of noise, cheering and boos.\n\n\"We knew we had to be within a radius behind them and we wanted not to just stand there and let them come at us,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cWe wanted to keep a respectful distance and be respectful to that but we didn't just want to stand in a flat line and let them come at us.\"\n\nEngland knew that by challenging New Zealand, they would provoke a fury within the All Blacks that would need to be handled, though Manu Tuilagi\u2019s try after 98 seconds went a long way towards doing that.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s why we won but it\u2019s too show that we\u2019re ready to accept the challenge,\u201d said Tuilagi. \u201cComing against New Zealand any game is tough but in the semis it\u2019s even tougher. You\u2019ve got to make all your tackles, use all the possession really well. I think we did that today. Fair play to the boys and the big boys who were getting us through.\u201d\n\nEngland are likely to be fined by World Rugby for encroaching in the New Zealand half during the Haka, given that France were hit for \u00a32,500 for doing something similar eight years ago before the World Cup final. But Mako Vunipola revealed after the match that Marler mistakenly went to circle the All Blacks while they were doing the Haka, meaning that the England prop will have to foot the bill.\n\n\u201cJoe actually got confused, he thought we were going to surround them, so he can pay the fine!\u201d Vunipola said.\n\n\u201cObviously we spoke about it but nothing gets passed unless the boss has put his mark on it. He suggested it and we as players were happy to go with it. I\u2019ve only had the opportunity to face it a couple of times and every time you do it gets more special.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t mean any disrespect by it but we wanted to send a message that we were ready for the challenge and also give ourselves a bit of pressure where we had to back it up. I\u2019m very thankful that the performance backed it up.\u201d\n\nJones meanwhile paid tribute to what the All Blacks have achieved over the last eight years, and confirmed that he would meet with Hansen to share a beer together following the match, despite ending the Kiwi\u2019s World Cup hopes.\n\n\"They're a great team, they won two World Cups, they've got a great coach and a great captain, so we had to battle hard today,\u201d Jones said. \u201cYou always go in it with an idea of how you want the game to be and it never goes exactly like that. You've got to give credit to New Zealand for fighting until the end, we had to dig deep to win that game.\n\n\u201cIt gives us another week. We have another week and we're looking forward to it. We're not historians, we don't know but we know that we can play better next week. We're going to have to play better next week, whoever we play against.\n\n\"We're looking forward to Wales and South Africa playing a 3-3 draw, so they have to play extra time, it's still 3-3 and they have to play more extra time. That's the prediction.\n\n\"We don't control [who we\u2019ll play], but I'll definitely come and watch the game.\"", "description": "England\u00a0decided on responding to the Haka in order to challenge the \u201crugby gods\u201d in New Zealand, with Eddie Jones stressing that that the decision to form a V around the All Blacks was part of a plan to prove their motivation for the\u00a0Rugby World Cup semi-final.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/26/13/haka.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
