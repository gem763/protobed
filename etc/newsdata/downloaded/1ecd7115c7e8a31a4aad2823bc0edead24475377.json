A separate filing on behalf of six cable companies estimated their share would be $225 million.\n\nIn agreeing to the temporary stay of the CRTC's order, Montigny writes that the smaller ISPs do not dispute the seriousness of the issues raised in the appeal.\n\n\"I am also satisfied that the implementation of the CRTC order could result in a permanent market distortion which could be extremely difficult to remedy afterwards,\" Montigny writes.\n\nHe concludes that the \"balance of convenience favours the status quo\" until the appeal is heard but stipulates that the large ISPs must \"provide an undertaking\" to pay damages if their appeals are dismissed.", "description": "The Federal Court of Appeal has issued a temporary stay of a CRTC decision that seeks to force Canada's biggest internet service providers to provide smaller rivals with access to their networks at new, lower wholesale rates.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4411706.1569868425!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/crtc-internet-billing-20110711.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
