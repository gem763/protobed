We make decisions on the players we want to have and who's available and then it's the negotiations.\"\n\nUnited spent \u00a3145million in the summer on Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James, but Solskjaer says more funds are available for the right \"ready-made\" players.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\n\"The money is there and I've been looking at players,\" Solskjaer added. \"We were close to a couple of players but they weren't right.\n\n\"The money is there to strengthen in January, in the summer, and we are planning, we are looking, we are finding our targets, but just before the transfer window ended no, they weren't there, the ready-made players.\n\n\"The resources are there if the right players are available.\"", "description": "United currently sit 12th in the Premier League table, just two points above the relegation zone and 15 adrift of league leaders Liverpool", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Pa", "Empics Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20639459.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Rochdale-Carabao-Cup-Third-Round-Old-Trafford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
