(Reuters) - A team of federal investigators on Tuesday promised an exhaustive probe into a fire that killed all 34 passengers on a dive boat, many of whose charred bodies were believed trapped in the sunken wreckage off the California coast.\n\nAfter recovering 20 bodies from the 75-foot (23-meter) Conception or from the waters where the dive ship quickly sank off Santa Cruz Island, officials said they believed none of the 14 victims initially classified as missing had survived the fast-moving flames.\n\n\u201cThere were several other victims that were seen by the divers - between four and six - that are still between the wreckage, but due to the position of the boat they were unable to be recovered before nightfall,\u201d Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told a news conference.\n\n\u201cToday, efforts will be made to stabilize the boat so that divers can safely enter it, search it and recover additional victims,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThe five survivors, the boat captain and five members of his crew, were above deck when the blaze broke out at about 3:15 a.m. Pacific time and escaped in an inflatable boat. A crew member who perished was believed to have been sleeping below deck with the passengers.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board member Jennifer Homendy said 16 investigators were already taking part in the investigation, including specialists in operations, engineering, survival factors and fire analysis.\n\nShe said the experts would collect all perishable evidence while on scene for an estimated seven to 10 days but that the Conception would remain on the ocean floor more than 60 feet below the surface until a site survey had been completed.\n\nA few scant details about the victims, who ranged in age from 17 to 60, began to emerge as emergency workers planned to use DNA analysis here to positively identify the remains of the 20 bodies recovered so far.

Over,\u201d the dispatcher answered.\n\n\u201cTwenty-nine. Twenty-nine POB,\u201d said, using the abbreviation for \u201cpeople on board\u201d a vessel. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe! ... Twenty-nine POB.\u201d\n\nThe dispatcher requested the GPS location of the vessel at least two more times but the caller apparently fails to respond.\n\nKristy Finstad, 41, was leading the dive trip on the Conception, according to a Facebook post shared on Monday by her brother, Brett Harmeling.\n\nFinstad, a scuba diving instructor and marine biologist, was one of the owners of Worldwide Diving Adventures, the firm that chartered the boat for a three-day excursion to the Channel Islands.\n\nSlideshow (16 Images)\n\nA sea shell inscribed with the name \u201cKristy\u201d was left along the wooden fence at the dock.\n\n(Corrects spelling to Homendy from \u2018Homedy\u2019 paragraph 6.)", "description": "A team of federal investigators on Tuesday promised an exhaustive probe into a fire that killed all 34 passengers on a dive boat, many of whose charred bodies were believed trapped in the sunken wreckage off the California coast.", "authors": ["Omar Younis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425864460&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821T0"}
