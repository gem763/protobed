Worse, many of the league\u2019s loudest voices for criticizing America are suddenly unconcerned over human rights issues where it concerns their big-money partners in China.\n\nAndrew Brandt, a former Green Bay Packers executive, also slammed the NBA for its \u201cselective\u201d progressivism.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just say Adam Silver and the NBA are progressives with a blanket statement. Because it seems like it\u2019s selective,\u201d Brandt told the site.\n\nThe public perception of the NBA has changed, as a result of the China controversy. To many, gone is its claim to care about the downtrodden and oppressed, and in is the perception that the league is only concerned about the oppressed when it will not cost them any money.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s loss of the moral high ground may be giving the league fits, but it is like candy for the NFL.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "At least one NFL executive is enjoying the NBA's troubles, joking that the \"woke\" basketball league is being \"hoisted on its own petard\" for", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Mark-Schiefelbein1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
