The FAA has repeatedly said that the process for returning it to flight will take as long as required, but U.S. airlines that operate the plane are planning for a return to service early next year.\n\nFAA chief Steve Dickson \u2014 who days earlier had reprimanded Boeing for failing to show his agency the pilot messages \u2014 said last week that the company had hit several milestones, including handing over a key technical document. But he cautioned that testing and the consideration of training requirements would take \u201cseveral more weeks.\u201d\n\nEuropean regulators, meanwhile, have signaled that they won't necessarily follow the FAA's timeline. Instead they are relying on their own process, which includes testing and oversight independent of the FAA that will determine their timeline for allowing the MAX back in their airspace. Acknowledging this reality, Muilenburg has said a \"phased\" global return to service is possible.\n\nJeff Guzzetti, a consultant who previously worked at the FAA, said the combination of the Boeing pilot\u2019s messages and emails, the reports that have been released about the MAX and the congressional hearings \u201cmay cause people to choose not to fly on a 737 MAX for a while,\u201d but that is \u201cdifferent than delaying the ungrounding.\u201d\n\nStill, Guzzetti said he expects that Boeing will be \u201cpilloried\u201d at this week\u2019s hearings.\n\n\u201cAnd they deserve it. Those emails were pretty unprofessional,\u201d Guzzetti said.\n\nIn a 2016 email, Boeing 737 chief technical pilot Mark Forkner told someone at the FAA that he was \u201cjedi-mind tricking regulators into accepting the training that I got accepted by the FAA.\u201d\n\nIn a separate chain of instant messages with a Boeing coworker, also in 2016, Forkner wrote that an automated flight control feature called MCAS was \u201crunning rampant in the sim\" activating when it shouldn't. He also said that he had \"unknowingly\" lied to regulators, though it's unclear about exactly what.\n\nThe messages and emails together again focused intense attention from media outlets and regulators on Boeing and the way the plane was certified, and led the two Democratic lawmakers in the House in charge of overseeing aviation \u2014 Reps. Peter DeFazio of Oregon and Rick Larsen of Washington \u2014 to state in the strongest terms yet that legislation to address the agency's flaws in aircraft certification is coming.\n\n\"None of this looks good. None of it looks good for Boeing right now and none of it looks good frankly for the existing process we have that is supposed to have the FAA and the [Original Equipment Manufacturer], in this case Boeing, talking to each other,\" Larsen said in an interview with POLITICO. \"I don't see how the current certification laws stand.\"\n\nMorning Transportation A daily speed read on transportation and infrastructure \u2014 in your inbox.

The Boeing CEO is sure to be grilled about a series of reports from crash investigators and international experts that found problems with Boeing's design assumptions, the FAA's certification process and the company's communication with the FAA throughout.\n\nBut Guzzetti, the consultant, argued that the Lion Air report could actually \u201cprovide some relief to Boeing,\u201d since it points to maintenance problems and pilot shortcomings in addition to design issues.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to mitigate some of the blame that Boeing is going to get,\u201d Guzzetti said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/0f/ef/6a5f103442c08afc48ffc70028f6/191025-b737-max-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
