The president will also meet with Defense Secretary MARK ESPER. Wednesday: PRESIDENT TRUMP will host the president of Italy, and the two will hold a news conference. He will also have lunch with Secretary of State MIKE POMPEO. TRUMP will speak at an \u201cItalian-American reception.\u201d\n\nThursday: THE PRESIDENT will travel to Texas. He will participate in a roundtable and speak at a luncheon in Fort Worth. He will visit and cut an opening ribbon at the Louis Vuitton-Rochambeau Workshop in Johnson County, Texas. And he\u2019ll hold a rally in Dallas.\n\nDRIVING THE WEEK \u2026 WAPO\u2019S AARON DAVIS and JOHN HUDSON: \u201cTrump\u2019s envoy to testify that \u2018no quid pro quo\u2019 came from Trump\u201d: \u201cThe U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, intends to tell Congress this week that the content of a text message he wrote denying a quid pro quo with Ukraine was relayed to him directly by President Trump in a phone call, according to a person familiar with his testimony.\n\n\u201cSondland plans to tell lawmakers he has no knowledge of whether the president was telling him the truth at that moment. \u2018It\u2019s only true that the president said it, not that it was the truth,\u2019 said the person familiar with Sondland\u2019s planned testimony, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe person familiar with Sondland\u2019s testimony said the ambassador \u2018believed Trump at the time and on that basis passed along assurances\u2019 that Trump was not withholding military aid for political purposes.\n\n\u201cBut Sondland\u2019s testimony will raise the possibility that Trump wasn\u2019t truthful in his denial of a quid pro quo as well as an alternative scenario in which the president\u2019s interest in the scheme soured at a time when his administration faced mounting scrutiny over why it was withholding about $400 million in security assistance to Ukraine and delaying a leader-level visit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\u201d WaPo\n\nNYT\u2019S KEN VOGEL and MAGGIE HABERMAN: \u201cIn Show of Support, Trump Meets With Giuliani Over Lunch\u201d: \u201cPresident Trump had lunch on Saturday with Rudolph W. Giuliani amid revelations that prosecutors were investigating Mr. Giuliani for possible lobbying violations, and speculation that his position as the president\u2019s personal lawyer was in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cThe lunch, at Mr. Trump\u2019s golf course in Sterling, Va., was among several shows of the president\u2019s support for Mr. Giuliani on Saturday. They seemed meant to tamp down questions about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s status with a client famous for distancing himself from advisers when they encounter legal problems of their own.\u201d NYT\n\n-- MARC CAPUTO: \u201cGiuliani bungling gives Biden a new punchline\u201d\n\n-- READ THE WHOLE STORY \u2026 WAPO: \u201cHow two Soviet-born emigres made it into elite Trump circles \u2014 and the center of the impeachment storm,\u201d by Ros Helderman, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne and Tom Hamburger: \u201cBy spring 2018, the two men had dined with Trump, breakfasted with his son and attended exclusive events at Mar-a-Lago and the White House, all while jetting around the world and spending lavishly, particularly at Trump hotels in New York and Washington.

The official, who was not authorized to disclose operational details and spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.S. troops on the ground are at risk of being \u201cisolated\u201d and could clash with Turkey-backed Syrian forces.\n\n\u201cThe camp in Ain Eissa, some 35 kilometers (20 miles) south of the border, is home to some 12,000 people, including 1,000 wives and widows of Islamic State fighters and their children. The Kurdish-led administration in northern Syria said in a statement that 950 IS supporters escaped after attacking guards and storming the gates. It was not immediately possible to confirm that figure.\u201d AP\n\nNBC\u2019S @RichardEngel: \u201cTurkey\u2019s conflict in Syria took a major turn [Saturday]. First alleged atrocities by Turkish-backed Arab militias, executing Kurds. US military officials tell me it's true, and they are DEEPLY concerned it opens the door to BOTH ethnic cleansing of Kurds and return of ISIS/Al-Qaeda\u201d\n\nBIG NEWS \u2026 DEFENSE SECRETARY MARK ESPER told MARGARET BRENNAN on CBS\u2019S \u201cFACE THE NATION\u201d that all U.S. troops are being evacuated from Syria: ESPER: \u201cWe find ourselves as we have American forces likely caught between two opposing advancing armies and it's a very untenable situation. So I spoke with the president last night after discussions with the rest of the national security team and he directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Just in the last week or two, my general counsel sent out a note as we typically do in these situations to ensure documents are retained.\u201d\n\nBRENNAN: \u201cIs that a yes? ESPER: \u201cThat's a yes.\u201d BRENNAN: \u201cYou will comply with the subpoena?\u201d ESPER: \u201cWe will do everything we can to comply.\u201d\n\nESPER on \u201cFOX NEWS SUNDAY\u201d: WALLACE: \u201cWe\u2019re going to pull out and allow the Kurds to go to the Russians and the Syrians? That doesn\u2019t seem to make much sense.\u201d ESPER: \u201cThe United States, first of all, doesn\u2019t have the forces on hand to stop an invasion of Turkey that is 15,000 strong, if you will, preceded by air strikes and artillery and mechanized forces. Gotta keep in mind, too: We didn\u2019t sign up to fight Turkey, a longstanding NATO ally on behalf of the SDF.\u201d\n\nCHUCK TODD spoke to JIM MATTIS on NBC\u2019S \u201cMEET THE PRESS\u201d: TODD: \u201cAre we still doing this fight now? Or have we just pulled back, and it's now up to the Kurds on their own?\u201d\n\nMATTIS: \u201cWell it\u2019s -- it\u2019s in a, it\u2019s in a situation of disarray right now. Obviously, the Kurds are adapting to the Turkish attacks. And we'll have to see if they're able to maintain the fight against ISIS. It's going to have an impact. The question is, how much?\n\nTODD: \u201cHow concerned should we be about abandoning an ally like the Kurds that maybe twenty years down the road this comes to bite us?\u201d\n\nMATTIS: \u201cRight. I think Secretary of State Pompeo, the intelligence services, the foreign countries that are working with us have it about right that ISIS is not defeated. We have got to keep the pressure on ISIS so they don't recover. We may want a war over, we may even declare it over. You can pull your troops out, as President Obama learned the hard way, out of Iraq but the 'enemy gets the vote' we say in the military. And in this case, if we don't keep the pressure on then ISIS will resurge. It's, it's absolutely a given that they will come back.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019S JAKE TAPPER spoke to SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-N.D.) on \u201cSTATE OF THE UNION\u201d: TAPPER: \u201cWell, Senator, Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced this morning that the president is now ordering most of the remaining U.S. forces in Syria to withdraw because the situation in the border area has gotten so dangerous, after he ordered that smaller withdrawal earlier this week. You're on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Were you informed of this? Did you -- were you briefed about it?\n\nCRAMER: \u201cNo, I was not. No, we were briefed, again, after the -- the last withdrawal announcement and received more information. I felt, at that time, more comfortable than I did prior to the briefing. I hope that I feel better after I get briefed this -- now this week when we return to Washington, and learn more of the details, because, while there's a withdrawal, what I'd like to know is, a withdrawal to where?\u201d\n\nCHRIS WALLACE spoke to SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-Md.) on \u201cFOX NEWS SUNDAY\u201d: VAN HOLLEN: \u201cYou just heard the current Secretary of Defense essentially say the Trump Administration is doing nothing. They\u2019re asking Turkey, \u2018Oh, please, please, stop what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 That is nothing. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re gonna see a strong, bipartisan response from the congress. First of all, we want to insist that President Trump actually step up and do something. He said he's gonna destroy the Turkish economy if Erdogan did this kind of thing. And yet, he's doing absolutely nothing.\u201d\n\nCHINA 1, U.S. 0? \u2026 WSJ: \u201cChina Emerges With Wins From U.S. Trade Truce: U.S. shelves new tariffs against Beijing while leaving many demands to be worked out later,\u201d by Chao Deng in Washington and Lingling Wei in Beijing: \u201cFor now the truce opens an opportunity for Beijing to kick down the road concessions that it doesn\u2019t want to make. Whether those hard issues ever get resolved is a question.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese leadership feels that time is on its side, believing President Trump is under pressure to make compromises as part of his re-election bid next year. But by trying to drag out the negotiations, Beijing also risks the prospect that Mr. Trump may harden his position again to show he is being tough on China\u2014or that it may have to start over with a new Democratic president.\u201d WSJ\n\nPOLITICO EUROPE: \u201cMerkel tells Erdo\u011fan to halt Syrian offensive\u201d by Joshua Posaner: \u201cTurkey\u2019s military offensive in Syria threatens to destabilize the region and boost ISIS, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in a phone call Sunday.\n\n\u201c\u2018The chancellor spoke in favor of an immediate end to the military operation,\u201d said Ulrike Demmer, a spokesperson for Merkel, adding that the Turkish leader had requested the call.\u201d POLITICO EU\n\nA message from The Coalition Against Socialized Medicine: Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Price Controls on prescription drugs are Bad for Patients, Bad for Innovation, and Bad for America.

He also pledged that he wouldn\u2019t work for any foreign-owned companies or serve on their boards during a potential Biden administration. He reiterated that he never discussed his business activities with his father.\n\n\u201cHunter always understood that his father would be guided, entirely and unequivocally, by established U.S. policy, regardless of its effects on Hunter\u2019s professional interests,\u201d the statement said. \u2018He never anticipated the barrage of false charges against both him and his father by the President of the United States.\u2019\u201d Bloomberg\n\nBOSTON GLOBE\u2019S \u201cBACK TO THE BATTLEGROUND\u201d SERIES \u2026 \u201cThey helped Trump win Michigan, then his immigration crackdown split their community,\u201d by Liz Goodwin in Madison Heights, Michigan\n\n2020 WATCH \u2026\n\n-- JON KARL spoke to SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vt.) on ABC\u2019S \u201cTHIS WEEK\u201d: KARL: \u201cSo let me ask you a blunt question that I\u2019ve heard others ask. What do you say to those who say that they would pick her because she\u2019s eight years younger than you, she didn\u2019t just have a heart attack. And look, in the positions you\u2019re pretty much the same.\u201d\n\nSANDERS: \u201cWell look. Everybody, every American is gonna make his or her own choice about the candidate that they want. And Elizabeth Warren has been a friend of mine for some 25 years. And I think she is a very, very good senator. But there are differences between Elizabeth and myself. Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I\u2019m not. I think the situation today that we face in this country of the greed and the corruption that is existing in Washington, that is existing at the corporate elite level. Where you have massive amounts of price fixing going on in the drug companies. Where we\u2019re the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people. Where we have right now as we speak in the fossil fuel industry, you got companies making billions of dollars a year in profit doing what?\n\n\u201cOh, by the way, they\u2019re destroying the planet. Alright. And I think business as usual and doing it the old fashioned way is not good enough. It\u2019s not regulation. Now what we need is in fact, I don\u2019t want to get people too nervous, we need a political revolution. I am, I believe, the only candidate who\u2019s gonna say to the ruling class of this country, the corporate elite, enough, enough with your greed and with your corruption.

Rispone, who spent about $11.5 million \u2014 mostly of his own money \u2014 on the campaign, came in second with 368,318 votes, or 27%, followed by three-term Congressman Abraham, of Alto, with 317,115, or 24% of the vote.\u201d The Advocate\n\nBONUS GREAT HOLIDAY WEEKEND READS, curated by Daniel Lippman (@dlippman):\n\n-- \u201cTop Military Officers Unload on Trump,\u201d by Mark Bowden in The Atlantic\u2019s November issue: \u201cThe commander in chief is impulsive, disdains expertise, and gets his intelligence briefings from Fox News.

Whether it be the wholesale elimination and prohibition of private insurance and imposition of socialized medicine in the form of Sen. Sanders\u2019 $32 trillion Medicare for All plan, or Speaker Pelosi\u2019s glidepath toward the same goal with her prescription drug pricing plan, these misguided proposals pose grave threats to the quality and availability of every single Americans\u2019 health care, to the cutting-edge treatments and cures of tomorrow, and to our nation\u2019s economy. Single payer health care schemes and drug price controls have been tried abroad with the same results: access restrictions for patients, decisions made by bureaucrats rather than patients and doctors, stifled innovation, and crippling taxes. This is not the policy prescription for health care in America.
