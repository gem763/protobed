(Picture: WPBF)\n\nA mother is behind bars after she made her son get 13 unnecessary major surgeries after faking his illnesses.\n\nKaylene Bowen-Wright was sentenced to six years in jail on Friday in Dallas, Texas after she pleaded guilty to causing serious bodily harm to her son Christopher, who is now 10.\n\nAuthorities say Christopher suffered from blood infections and radiation he had been exposed to because of the needless procedures.\n\nChristopher also suffers \u2018serious mental impairment from the suspect continually teaching (Christopher) that he is ill\u2019 and from putting him a wheelchair at an early age, according to court documents.\n\nThe problems began 11 days after Christopher was born, when his mother was seen pouring out milk that he did not finish and \u2018lying to medical professionals that (Christopher) had taken the entire contents of his bottle.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nOver the next eight years, Bowen-Wright took her son from doctor to doctor.
