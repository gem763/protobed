USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 He's pressed the right buttons all month, but Washington Nationals manager Dave Martinez finally saw his dam break in Game 4 of the World Series.\n\nThe Houston Astros scored four runs against three Washington relievers in the seventh inning, turning a manageable 4-1 game into an 8-1 runaway that evened the Fall Classic at two games apiece.\n\nAfter the Nationals plated a run in the bottom of the sixth, Martinez went to Tanner Rainey, rather than either of his top two relievers \u2013 Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson \u2013 who hadn't pitched since Game 1 on Tuesday.\n\nRainey walked the first two batters he faced before getting Jose Altuve to fly out.\n\n\"Rainey has been our guy in the seventh inning,\" Martinez said. \"It just happens he couldn't throw strikes tonight.\"\n\nALL TIED UP: Astros make World Series a best-of-three\n\nGAME 5: Trump plans late arrival on Sunday\n\nWith two on and one out, Martinez called on 42-year-old righty Fernando Rodney to face the left-handed Michael Brantley \u2013 rather than potentially go lefty-lefty with Doolittle in the key spot.\n\nBrantley would single to load the bases.\n\n\"He's been pitching good,\" Martinez said of Rodney. \"He made a really good pitch to a really good hitter, hit the ball at the end of the bat, got a base hit.\"\n\nFernando Rodney looks on during the seventh inning. (Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe next batter, Alex Bregman, drove Rodney's second pitch 392 feet inside the left-field foul pole for a grand slam.\n\nJust like that, the game was out of reach.\n\nRodney remained in the game and loaded the bases with three walks, only managing to get one out. Martinez then went to Wander Suero, who struck out Kyle Tucker to prevent the contest from becoming a complete laugher.\n\nMartinez acknowledged it would \"definitely would have been different\" if the Nationals had closed the gap further, rather than scoring just the one run after loading the bases with one out.\n\n\"You're down still three runs,\" Martinez said.\n\n\"For me, you don't chase wins.\"\n\nEven though Doolittle and Hudson were fresh, Martinez wasn't going to use them in the three-run hole and was saving them for Game 5 and beyond.\n\n\"Come tomorrow we're up 2-0, and all of a sudden we're in the 7th inning \u2013 you have to use Hudson for two innings, you have to use Doolittle for two innings.\n\n\"You want those guys ready to pitch. I know we got a day off (Monday). All this was talked about before the game.\"", "description": "Washington manager Dave Martinez didn't use his top two relievers \u2013 both well-rested \u2013 in Game 4 and watched things unravel in the seventh.", "authors": ["Jesse Yomtov", "Published A.M.
