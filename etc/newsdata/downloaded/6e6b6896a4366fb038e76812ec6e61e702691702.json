Bush, has slammed Vice President Mike Pence for staying at a hotel owned by President Donald Trump during a visit to Ireland this week.\n\nPence faced criticism for overnighting at the Trump resort in Doonbeg, a three-hour drive from where he had meetings in Dublin. The vice president defended the decision, citing its proximity to his \u201cancestral hometown.\u201d\n\nBush-era official Painter, however, described Pence\u2019s patronage of the Trump resort as \u201coutrageous\u201d on Tuesday\u2019s broadcast of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Beat with Ari Melber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States government is paying for that,\u201d Painter explained. \u201cThe federal government is going to make a big outlay in order to promote the Trump hotel. Trump will make money when Secret Service agents stay there.\u201d\n\nPainter added: \u201cOur money is being used to promote his hotel. This is a violation of the domestic emoluments clause, which caps the president\u2019s compensation for his services at his compensations set by Congress. He is not entitled to milk the taxpayer right, left, and center. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing here.\u201d\n\nMelber then aired footage from Trump\u2019s first press conference as president, during which he pledged to divest control of his business interests to his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.\n\nPainter, however, argued Trump was still running The Trump Organization from the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to make the Trump Organization richer and he\u2019s using his official position as president of the United States to do that,\u201d Painter said. \u201cAnd he is enriching himself in violation of the Constitution, which restricts his compensation. He has no right to do that with our money.\u201d\n\nCheck out the clip above.", "description": "Richard Painter railed against spending taxpayer money to help the president's personal businesses.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6fac922400004f007386c8.png?cache=ehxvkafdgn&ops=1778_1000"}
