REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Dozens of demonstrators belonging to a group called \u201cStop the Coup\u201d gathered in central Berlin on Saturday to protest against a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe protesters, who collected signatures for a petition, said they wanted to defend British democracy following Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s order to suspend parliament for five weeks before Britain is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cThis calculated prorogation of parliament is a threat to British democracy, causing a constitutional crisis at a time of national crisis,\u201d read the petition letter, which the demonstrators planned to deliver later on Saturday to Britain\u2019s ambassador to Germany.\n\n\u201cThis utter chaos has brought us together in solidarity to defend British democracy,\u201d the letter added.\n\nSaturday\u2019s demonstration in Berlin took place as the BBC reported that British lawmakers, including Conservatives expelled this week from the party, were preparing legal action in case Johnson refuses to seek a delay to Brexit.\n\nAbout 100 people from Britain and other European countries took part in the event near the Brandenburg Gate, a symbol of German unity, and just steps away from the British embassy.", "description": "Dozens of demonstrators belonging to a group called \"Stop the Coup\" gathered in central Berlin on Saturday to protest against a no-deal Brexit.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427245409&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF860IB", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
