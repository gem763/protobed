It's not as bad as it was in the last few weeks, especially against Aston Villa,' Farke said.\n\n'The break helped us to settle and recover, so it came at the right moment.\n\n'When we have all our players fully fit we are competitive at this level, even though we are the underdog in every game because we are a newly-promoted side that didn't spend lots of money.\n\nBen Godfrey will feature after undergoing a hernia operation over the international break\n\n'However, we have to make sure expectations aren't too high.\n\n'One thing is to have players in training, the other is to have them fully fit.'\n\nThe Canaries have already shipped 21 goals from eight Premier League matches.\n\nFarke maintains he is 'not naive' to the situation, one which has not been helped by the injury problems.\n\n'You have to be solid in defending, whether you play football 20 years ago or now,' Farke told a press conference.\n\nFarke insists his marauding full-backs are not to blame for the Canaries' poor defensive record\n\n'It was quite normal that we were struggling a bit, but we have to reduce the goals we concede or we will have big problems.\n\n'We are praised a lot for our brave and offensive style. None of our conceded goals are due to full-backs being too high.\n\n'It is more to do with defensive behaviour. Of course we have to step up and find solutions as a team.'\n\nUnlike the Norfolk club, Bournemouth have gone on to establish themselves in the Premier League since being promoted in 2015.\n\nFarke said: 'They stand for a special philosophy and style of play, so they can be a role model for us, improving from year to year, even though the first and second are unbelievably difficult.'", "description": "Norwich head coach Daniel Farke does not want too much expectation on the players returning from injury as they look to kick-start their Premier League campaign.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/16/19888502-0-image-a-59_1571411425942.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
