It\u2019s the variegation that makes this plant so prized. She paid $330 for the plant which she describes as \u201ca unicorn find\u201d.\n\nOn Gumtree, cuttings \u2013 not even mature plants \u2013 from similarly coloured monstera varieties have sold for $650, while the prices for established plants can run into the thousands.\n\nOne particularly popular variety, the Thai constellation monstera (so-called because the flecks of cream in its green leaves are meant to resemble stars), is grown specially in a laboratory in Thailand to achieve the variegated effect. \u201cA couple of months ago you couldn\u2019t get them anywhere and they were really expensive,\u201d says Rick Schmutter, who runs Uprooted.com.au, a small business selling indoor plants. \u201cNow they\u2019re a bit more accessible and people are getting a bit more excited about it.\u201d\n\nSchmutter sells small variegated monsteras for $180 a plant. He buys 50 at a time from his wholesaler, and says that he usually sells out within a month.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Thai constellation monstera.

It\u2019s not worthwhile to bring in one or even 100, you have to bring in thousands.\u201d The logistical difficulty of importing the plant creates a lag between when a plant starts to trend, and when the supply catches up \u2013 which inflates the pot plant\u2019s value.\n\nBusova first fell in love with variegated monsteras six months ago, on a closed Facebook group called Crazy Indoor Plant People Australia, which has 63,000+ members. Schmutter is also a member of this group, which he uses to market his business. Here, plant lovers trade advice and swap stories of bargain buys. That bargain-hunting has made the Thai constellation monstera a controversial choice, with many in the group labelling the plant \u201ca rip off\u201d. Some members have even made fun of those who are prepared to invest in the plant.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t faze Busova, who penned a defence of the plant\u2019s price on the group. \u201cSome people spend thousands on handbags, that they wear and show off. It makes them happy. That\u2019s how I\u2019m like with my plants,\u201d she tells the Guardian.\n\nAs for how she shows them off: \u201cI have an Instagram account where I post photos of my plants.\u201d The main reason Busova saves up for prized plants, and spends up to an hour a day caring for them is less tangible than a perfect photographic moment. \u201cI think it\u2019s how striking they are, especially if they have the crisp, white variegation. It just catches my eye. As soon as I saw it something sparked inside me.\u201d\n\nThai constellation monsteras are not the most popular plant Schmutter sells. That honour goes to a variegated Picasso peace lily \u2013 which sells for a far more affordable $35 a plant.\n\nSchmutter started selling plants a year ago, after he noticed how many he was buying for himself. In that time, while some plants inflate in value when local supplies run low, he doesn\u2019t think people\u2019s tastes in plants have changed that much. They want what they can\u2019t get. \u201cPeople really appreciate unpopular and rare plants, and variegated plants.\u201d\n\nAs for the next variegated monstera \u2013 he\u2019s heard rumours. \u201cSome of my suppliers are working on a special philodendron, but I can\u2019t get the details.\u201d", "description": "The cream and white variegated monstera is the Instagram plant de jour and for the fanatics, money is no object", "authors": ["Alyx Gorman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fce81ce6da1fbf23eb1b8a214b8bf9299f13c633/0_960_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b076567455fe13c86bc7c644447bf743", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
