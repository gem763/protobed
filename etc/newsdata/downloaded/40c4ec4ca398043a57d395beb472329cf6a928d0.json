We will take a comprehensive look to uncover these core recommendations, factoring respective salaries into the analysis.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nWe have a nine-game slate this evening.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nSean Manaea \u2013 Oakland Athletics (vs Rangers)\n\nManaea isn\u2019t the top-projected pitcher in the slate \u2013 that honor belongs to Walker Buehler. However, there\u2019s modest cause to worry about the duration of Buehler\u2019s outing. The Dodgers don\u2019t need to wear out their ace. He also costs a boatload on DFS platforms. By comparison, Manaea is relatively inexpensive.\n\nIn three starts since returning from the injured list, he\u2019s posted unusually high strikeout (10.50 K/9) and swinging strike (13.6% SwStr%) rates. He\u2019s also benefited from some batted ball fortune (.139 BABIP) en route to a tiny 0.50 ERA. The biggest noticeable change is a sharp increase in slider usage at the expense of his changeup. The Rangers have the second highest strikeout rate against left-handed pitchers.\n\nAlso Consider: Walker Buehler, Jose Berrios, Max Fried, Cal Quantrill (value)\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nFreddie Freeman \u2013 Atlanta Braves (vs Johnny Cueto)\n\nStory continues\n\nCueto has pitched well since returning from the injured list, but can he tame the Atlanta offense? They will be his toughest challenge to date. Freeman is a multi-talented DFS weapon, offering a consistently high floor and contest-busting ceiling. His all-fields, line drive-oriented approach and balanced mechanics are an effective counter for Cueto\u2019s funky deliveries.\n\nAlso Consider: J.T. Realmuto (value), Mitch Garver, Sean Murphy (value), Cody Bellinger, Jay Bruce (value), Joc Pederson (value), Rhys Hoskins\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nGavin Lux \u2013 Los Angeles Dodgers (vs Chi Chi Gonzalez)\n\nA full Dodgers stack looks mighty attractive tonight opposite one of the very worst pitchers in the majors. Gonzalez is homer prone (1.73 HR/9), rarely induces strikeouts (5.54 K/9), and struggles with command (5.19 BB/9). His 6.23 ERA is earned in every sense of the word. Lux has performed merely passably through his first 54 plate appearances. However, as I noted yesterday, his batted ball profile and underlying traits suggest a big breakout is on the horizon. He projects as a top-three second baseman despite a bargain bin price tag.\n\nUnder ordinary conditions, Max Muncy would be the player listed here, but he left Friday night\u2019s game with quad soreness. He\u2019ll probably sit.\n\nAlso Consider: Mike Moustakas, Jose Altuve, Mauricio Dubon (value)\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nMatt Chapman \u2013 Oakland Athletics (vs Brock Burke)\n\nChapman is both the top third baseman and one of the best value plays in the slate. His role as the Athletics second or third hitter is useful, but it\u2019s a matchup against Burke which really sets Chapman apart. The Rangers southpaw is a ground ball pitcher who lacks any sort of swing-and-miss capability (4.85 K/9). He\u2019s also struggled with home runs in a small sample (2.08 HR/9). Chapman is a low-ball masher and should enjoy lifting bad sinking fastballs into the deepest regions of the outfield.\n\nAlso Consider: Mike Moustakas, Alex Bregman, Josh Donaldson, Kyle Seager, Renato Nunez (value)\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nMarcus Semien \u2013 Oakland Athletics (vs Brock Burke)\n\nIf you\u2019re going in on Chapman, you might as well double down with Semien too. Unlike Chapman, Semien is a true platoon masher. Over his career, he\u2019s shown significantly better plate discipline and contact skills against southpaws. There are a couple downsides to using the Athletics\u2019 leadoff man. Unlike Chapman, he\u2019s not deeply discounted. Additionally, he makes a lot of pulled, ground ball contact which feeds into Burke\u2019s strengths. In all probability, Burke will be chased by the fifth inning. The Rangers bullpen is volatile.\n\nAlso Consider: Francisco Lindor, Alex Bregman, Marcus Semien, Mauricio Dubon (value), Corey Seager, Jorge Polanco\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nCody Bellinger \u2013 Los Angeles Dodgers (vs Chi Chi Gonzalez)\n\nIf you\u2019re stacking Lux and the Dodgers, you ought to roster their most elite producer. Bellinger is among the likeliest to homer tonight with a better than one-in-three chance to send one (or more) over the wall. Not only is Gonzalez an exploitable opponent, the Rockies bullpen is downright hideous. Dodgers Stadium tends to be fairly homer happy at this time of year.\n\nJosh Rojas \u2013 Arizona Diamondbacks (at Cal Quantrill)\n\nIf you want to roster multiple of the names listed above, you\u2019ll need to slot in a few deep bargains. Rojas is one such option. He\u2019s perhaps the best dollar-for-dollar value in the entire slate. He\u2019s yet to hit for much power since reaching the majors despite making plenty of hard contact. Strikeouts have also been an unexpected issue in the majors. He\u2019s posted a 26.1 percent strikeout rate in 119 plate appearances compared to a sub-15 percent rate in the minors. Quantrill is a Triple-A quality pitcher which should help Rojas to deliver punchier results.\n\nAlso Consider: Nelson Cruz, Ronald Acuna, Bryce Harper, Yordan Alvarez, Jay Bruce, Eddie Rosario, Franmil Reyes (value), Trent Grisham (value), Jaylin Davis (value)", "description": "Brad Johnson finds the best MLB DFS Plays for Saturday, September 21.
