The fact that this prediction was made by Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale suggests the likelihood a familial succession will, at least, be attempted.\n\nThe reason this idea is so demoralizing is that it speaks to the futility of opposing Trump. There may be a Trump running for president for the next...gulp...24 years.\n\nDespite the havoc Trump has unleashed, he still has a decent chance of re-election. And even if he loses (and actually leaves the White House), he won\u2019t go away. He\u2019ll still be on Twitter, he\u2019ll probably still hold rallies, and the mainstream media will probably still elevate all of his mockery and musings.", "description": "Brad Parscale said over the weekend that the Trump family will \u201clast for decades\u201d in politics. Yes, it\u2019s nuts. And there is good reason to fear he\u2019s right.", "authors": ["Matt Lewis", "Senior Columnist"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_2998,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568055584/190910-lewis-brad-pascale-hero_xajbov", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
