A tough decision for prize committee", "language": "en", "text": "OSLO (Reuters) - Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg\u2019s shaming of world leaders and air travelers over climate change has won her millions of admirers and attracted many new followers to her cause.\n\nBut it just might cost her the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThunberg, one of few people whose nomination has become known before the awards ceremony, is the bookmakers\u2019 favorite to win the prize next month.\n\nAt 16, she would be the youngest recipient of the $930,000 award won by the likes of Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter and Mikhail Gorbachev. She would be the first to win the prize for environmental work since former U.S. vice president Al Gore shared it in 2007 for raising awareness of climate change.\n\nBut Thunberg\u2019s youth, outspokenness and confrontational approach - the very factors that have made her the global face of climate change activism - present challenging questions for the Norwegian Nobel Committee.\n\nHer shaming of those who choose to travel by airplane - #flightshame \u2013 raises hackles among some people. The denunciations of world leaders by a teenager alienates others.\n\nWhile liberals see her as courageous for telling the truth about climate change, right-wing critics depict her as a liar or hypocrite, suggest her parents have manipulated her or portray her as the ringleader of a socialist conspiracy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while (since Gore was awarded the prize in 2007) ... so that would boost her chances,\u201d Sverre Lodgaard, a deputy member of the award committee from 2003 to 2011, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the principle of \u2018flight shame\u2019 brings her chances ... down. Shame is not a constructive feeling to bring about change.\u201d\n\nThunberg, who does not usually take media requests directly, did not immediately respond to requests for comment made through her father, Svante Thunberg, and to an email account set up to handle media queries.\n\nGreta Thunberg has hit back at her critics, denying she is paid for her activism or is being \u201cused\u201d by anyone.\n\nShe wrote on Facebook in February that \u201cthere is no one \u2018behind\u2019 me except for myself. My parents were as far from climate activists as possible before I made them aware of the situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cA VERY HAPPY YOUNG GIRL\u201d\n\nThunberg rose to global prominence last year by taking time off school to demonstrate outside Swedish parliament about the lack of action to combat climate change. Inspired by her weekly protest, millions of young people protested around the globe last Friday to put pressure on governments to act.\n\nThis week, after sailing to New York in a zero-carbon emissions vessel, she accused leaders at the U.N. climate summit of stealing her dreams and childhood with empty words on climate change.\n\n\u201cHow dare you?\u201d she asked.\n\nHer comments did not go down well with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has questioned climate science and has challenged every major U.S. regulation aimed at combating climate change.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Swedish activist Greta Thunberg participates in a youth climate change protest in front of the United Nations Headquarters in Manhattan, New York City, New York, U.S., August 30, 2019. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon\n\nRetweeting footage of her speech, he mocked Thunberg by saying: \u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\u201d\n\nThunberg responded by changing her Twitter biography to: \u201cA very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.\u201d\n\nTrump also suggested he ought to receive the Nobel Peace Prize himself \u201cfor a lot of things if they gave it out fairly, which they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWith Nobel Prize winners inevitably thrust into the spotlight, the committee will consider Thunberg\u2019s age and how a teenager would cope with even more intense public scrutiny than she is already under, Lodgaard said.\n\nFive years ago, Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai won the award at the age of 17, but her candidacy was less divisive than Thunberg\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt is a tremendous burden to give a Nobel to a teenager,\u201d said Asle Sveen, author of several books about the prize.\n\nEven so, he and Lodgaard say Thunberg still has a chance of winning.\n\nThe award committee could opt to reduce the weight of expectation on Thunberg by sharing the prize between her and someone else, or simply decide her behavior has shown she is mature beyond her years, they said.\n\n\u201cThey would have seen and heard her and she would have come across as thoughtful and effective. She could be a very good candidate,\u201d Lodgaard said.\n\nTHE DEFINITION OF PEACE\n\nAlso possibly counting against Thunberg is a debate in academic circles about whether environmental activism counts towards peace, as defined in Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel\u2019s will, even though Gore shared his award with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n\u201cThe argument \u2018for\u2019 is that the science shows we are experiencing a dramatic change of climate and we could have extreme conditions, with consequences in terms of war and refugees,\u201d Sveen said.\n\n\u201cThe argument \u2018against\u2019 would be: does a prize to the environment fall outside the boundaries of Nobel\u2019s will? This was an argument used when Al Gore and the IPCC won in 2007.\u201d\n\nApart from Thunberg, other leading possible contenders for the award include Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed for the reconciliation he forged in 2018 with Eritrea.\n\nThe neighbors fought a war that killed more than 70,000 people from 1998 to 2000 and failed to implement a 2000 peace deal. Also counting in Abiy\u2019s favor is his lifting of bans against opposition parties, said Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo.\n\nAbiy, who took office in April 2018, is pushing Ethiopia towards new democratic freedoms, though rights groups say more needs to be done to heal wounds after years of government repression.\n\nReporters Without Borders, or the Committee to Protect Journalists, groups that campaign for freedom of the press, could also be recognised.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cThere is very distinctly a case for this in the age of fake news,\u201d said Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nPope Francis, the United Nations Refugee Agency and its head, Filippo Grandi, are also mentioned among possible contenders for the price in recognition of their work towards refugees and as a way to highlight the right to asylum, under pressure in the United States, Europe and elsewhere.", "description": "Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg's shaming of world leaders and air travelers over climate change has won her millions of admirers and attracted many new followers to her cause.", "authors": ["Gwladys Fouche", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433721035&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0QT", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
