Marketing these addictive products must stop. Today is an opportunity to be proactive in our efforts to eliminate drug use and addiction among our youth.\u201d\n\nAfter her address, schoolchildren presented Melania Trump with a bouquet of red flowers and she posed for photos with students who signed the pledge to live a drug-free life.\n\n\u201cIn my time as First Lady, I have traveled to hospitals and visited rehabilitation centers where I have seen firsthand the horrible results of drug abuse,\u201d Mrs. Trump said. \u201cOur administration will continue working hard in fighting the opioid crisis.\u201d\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
