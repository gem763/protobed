Canada was overtaken by Germany\u2014which made its contract-complaint system digital\u2014and Thailand, but it surpassed Iceland. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: This is the second straight year Canada has dropped in the rankings\u2014it was 18th in 2018\u2014even though the country\u2019s score has increased slightly every year. That means Canada hasn\u2019t been getting worse for business, per the index\u2014other countries have just improved faster. (The country has, however, fallen significantly since 2006, when it ranked fourth.) Ottawa ranks particularly well on one key indicator in the 2020 edition\u2014it\u2019s one of 33 countries that gets top marks because they\u2019re in the top 15 per cent for the total tax and contribution rate mid-sized firms pay. After the U.S. cut corporate taxes in November 2017, business lobby groups argued that Canada\u2019s rates are no longer competitive. In November 2018, the federal government allowed companies to write off equipment and technology purchases faster, but did not cut the overall rate.", "description": "", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
