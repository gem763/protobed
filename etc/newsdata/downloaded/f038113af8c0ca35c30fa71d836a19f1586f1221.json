Mr. Menashi worked since 2018 as associate counsel to the president.\n\nThe letter references testimony from Joseph Maguire, acting Director of National Intelligence, to lawmakers Thursday, saying the White House Counsel\u2019s Office was consulted about the July 25 phone call between the two presidents, noting the DNI was told that much of the complaint was subject to executive privilege.\n\n\u201cAs the Senate Judiciary Committee considers your nomination to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, it is vital to understand the work that you have done in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, including any work related to the matters referenced above,\u201d the letter read.\n\nCongressional Democrats are accusing the president of making improper requests from Mr. Zelensky to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company that had been investigated by a prosecutor.\n\nFriday\u2019s letter isn\u2019t the first time Mr. Menashi was questioned about his work in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing this month, he was peppered with questions about what work he did related to the president\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s top Democrat, specifically asked whether Mr. Menashi worked on the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy or whether he handled the president\u2019s move to limit the number of refugees entering the country.\n\nBefore his hearing, Mr. Menashi was already a target of the progressive left after MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow aired a 13-minute segment last month, attacking a law review article Mr. Menashi wrote years ago that the TV host suggested was racist.\n\nThe 65-page article from 2010 for the University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law drew fire over Mr. Menashi\u2019s noting that ethno-nationalism is an accepted part of liberal democracies in a defense of Israel as \u201ca Jewish state.\u201d\n\n\u201cI abhor discrimination. I value this country\u2019s traditions of tolerance and equality before the law,\u201d Mr. Menashi said, defending himself from the attacks. He said the point of his article was to note that some liberal democracies have an ethnic basis.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
