(Image: Jamal Campbell, Marvel)\n\nOne of the reasons Sony was willing to part ways with Disney and yank Peter Parker out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is that the studio holds the film rights to a rather significant chunk of characters who exist within Spider-Man\u2019s orbit. For instance: Miles Morales, Cindy Moon, Venom, Morbius and Madame Web, a clairvoyant mutant who\u2019s now making her way to the big screen.\n\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, Sony has tapped Morbius co-writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless to begin penning a script for a feature film focused on Cassandra Webb, a.k.a. Madame Web, a disabled, precognitive psychic who, in Marvel\u2019s comics, is cybernetically tethered to a gargantuan chair that resembles a web.\n\nWhile Madame Web doesn\u2019t typically become physically involved in hero work, her vast array of psionic abilities make her an invaluable ally to a number of Spider-themed heroes who she\u2019s worked with over the years \u2014 especially in her role as the guardian of the Web of Life and Destiny, the transdimensional nexus of fate that isn\u2019t just where most Spider-heroes in the multiverse derive their powers from in the comics, but that allows them to travel anywhere in the multiverse.\n\nBecause Madame Web has most often functioned as a kind of mentor to Spider-vigilantes, one imagines that she won\u2019t be the only hero featured in Sony\u2019s film \u2014 but given her connections beyond simply her powers, she might end up becoming a rather important piece of the cinematic web the studio\u2019s trying to build.", "description": "One of the reasons Sony was willing to part ways with Disney and yank Peter Parker out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is that the studio holds the film rights to a rather significant chunk of characters who exist within Spider-Man\u2019s orbit.
