UPDATE 1-Oil prices edge up after turbulent week as Saudi Arabia reassures on output\n\n* Return to full production pledged by end-September\n\n* U.S. to impose more sanctions on Iran\n\n* Cushing oil stocks at lowest since Oct 2018 - EIA\n\n(Adds Kuwait oil sector heightens security, updates prices)\n\nBy Florence Tan\n\nSINGAPORE, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher in\n\nAsian trade on Thursday after days of turbulence, with markets\n\nsoothed by Saudi Arabia's pledge to restore full production by\n\nend-September at facilities knocked out in drone and missile\n\nattacks last weekend.\n\nBrent crude futures rose 8 cents to $63.68 a barrel\n\nby 0507 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude\n\nwas up 14 cents to $58.25 a barrel.\n\nThe steadying of nerves, after a 14.6% jump in Brent prices\n\non Monday - the contract's biggest one-day percentage gain since\n\nat least 1988 - came after Saudi Arabia set out the timeline to\n\nfull operation, and also said it had managed to restore supplies\n\nto customers at levels prior to the attacks by drawing from its\n\noil inventories. Saudi Arabia, the world's leading oil exporter, has said the\n\ncrippling attack on its oil sites was \"unquestionably sponsored\"\n\nby bitter regional rival Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump said\n\nthere were many options short of war with Iran and added that he\n\nhad ordered the U.S. Treasury to \"substantially increase\n\nsanctions\" on Tehran. Iran has denied involvement in the\n\nstrikes. \"Prices may have found equilibrium for now,\" said Michael\n\nMcCarthy, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. Quick\n\nrecovery in Saudi oil production would confirm disruption could\n\nbe temporary, he said.\n\nOil analytics firm Kayrros estimated Saudi Arabia lost about\n\n3.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil output after crude oil\n\ninventories plunged nearly 10 million barrels as of Sept. 16\n\ncompared with pre-attack levels.\n\nStill, the head of the International Energy Agency said on\n\nWednesday it does not see a need to release emergency oil stocks\n\nas markets are well supplied. While tensions in the Middle East remained elevated, the\n\nWhite House's response on Wednesday to Saudi producing evidence\n\nthat it said implicated Iran in the attacks pointed to a more\n\nmeasured approach in handling the region's issues, said McCarthy\n\nat CMC Markets.\n\nFollowing the attacks in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait's oil sector\n\nis on high alert and has raised its security to the highest\n\nlevel as a precautionary measure, a Kuwaiti oil official said on\n\nWednesday. Separately, weekly data from the Energy Information\n\nAdministration on U.S. oil inventories provided a mixed\n\nsnapshot.\n\nCrude oil stockpiles at the world's largest oil producer\n\nrose by 1.1 million barrels last week against analysts'\n\nexpectations for a drop of 2.5 million barrels.\n\nHowever, stocks in Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for\n\nbenchmark futures, fell to the lowest since October 2018.\n\nEIA/S", "description": "UPDATE 1-Oil prices edge up after turbulent week as Saudi Arabia reassures on output", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB7I0G1_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
