Manson, a broadband engineer from Reading, had been experiencing a stabbing pain in his left nipple for months. But he ignored it until December 2013, when it got so bad that Michelle insisted. \u201cShe said: \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re playing at!\u2019\u201d Manson remembers.\n\nThe speed with which the GP referred him to the breast clinic at the Royal Berkshire hospital was Manson\u2019s first inkling that something was wrong. \u201cYou figure it\u2019s more than just a pain,\u201d Manson, now 48, remembers. He was right. He had stage four breast cancer that had spread to his lymph nodes. Six years on, following a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Manson\u2019s cancer is in remission \u2013 and he is hugely thankful he listened to his wife. \u201cI was lucky,\u201d he admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to the doctor as quickly as I should have, but I got away with it and \u2013 touch wood \u2013 I\u2019m in the clear.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andy Manson with his family.

Most will get the diagnosis between the ages of 60 and 70. Like women, they are more likely to develop it if they are obese.\n\nBecause men are more reluctant to visit GPs \u2013 and because of the misconception that only women can get breast cancer \u2013 their breast cancer is typically more advanced by the time it is diagnosed. \u201cWhen men have a suspicious lump in their chest, they often disregard it,\u201d says Prof Valerie Speirs of the University of Aberdeen, a cancer biologist who specialises in male breast cancer. \u201cThis means they usually present at a later stage than women and the cancer can be more difficult for clinicians to treat, because it\u2019s spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.\u201d\n\n\u201cMen need to be breast aware,\u201d says Grete Brauten-Smith, a clinical nurse specialist for Breast Cancer Now. She advises men to look out for breast lumps, which can be painless or close to the nipple, inverted nipples, sores on the chest or nipples that won\u2019t heal, swelling under the arm or in the chest area, or nipple discharge, which may also be bloody. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that they check their breast tissue, get to know any changes and report them to their GP.\u201d\n\nLife as a cancer patient: \u2018I was corroded, I was mutilated, I was uncertain, I was not OK\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cIt was such a shock,\u201d Doug Harper, 57, from Plumstead, says of his breast cancer diagnosis. \u201cI remember telling my mates and them saying: \u2018What do you mean? Men can\u2019t get breast cancer.\u2019\u201d Like Manson, Harper was cajoled into visiting the GP in January 2012 by his wife, after mistakenly thinking he had a cyst on his nipple. \u201cShe said: \u2018Go to the doctor \u2013 this is getting annoying.\u2019\u201d When he took off his T-shirt, the doctor\u2019s entire demeanour changed. Jokingly, Harper asked the doctor if it might be cancer. \u201cHe said: \u2018It could be.\u2019 I said: \u2018Oh God.\u2019\u201d\n\nMale breast cancer sufferers will find themselves in a system designed for women. When he was recovering from his mastectomy at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Woolwich, Harper\u2019s wardmates asked what procedure he was in for. \u201cI\u2019d say I had a mastectomy for breast cancer, and they\u2019d say: \u2018That can\u2019t possibly be right.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe was given the leaflet of a support group, but the wording only referred to female patients. Men attending breast cancer clinics will often be pegged as supportive partners, rather than patients. \u201cYou sit in the mammogram waiting room, and you\u2019re the only bloke there,\u201d Manson says. \u201cYou feel like people are looking at you, thinking you shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d\n\nDoug Harper.

People are starting to realise that male breast cancer needs to receive the same kind of attention that female breast cancer has for years,\u201d Speirs says. More work still needs to be done. \u201cI\u2019d like there to be more awareness of male breast cancer. Everything is a sea of pink.\u201d (The international symbol for breast cancer is a pink ribbon.)\n\nHaving breast cancer as a man can be isolating in other ways. The cancer drug Tamoxifen\u2019s side effects can include impotence, which men may find embarrassing or difficult to talk about. After being diagnosed in January 2012, Harper didn\u2019t meet another man with breast cancer until July of that year, when he took part in a charity event.\n\n\u201cI made a beeline for him,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI just wanted to talk with someone else who had been through the same as me.\u201d (Breast Cancer Now runs a matching service to connect male breast cancer patients with other men with the condition.)\n\nRecently, when he was going for a routine mammogram \u2013 his cancer is in remission \u2013 Harper saw a young man in his 20s being screened. He wanted to pass on his details, but decided against it in case he alarmed him. \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered how he got on.\u201d", "description": "Breast cancer affects far fewer men than women.
