Nor do the applicants have any entitlement to interdict payment of the management fee to protect the 1% fee to which HCI may, in the future, become entitled. Before HCI may become entitled to a 1% fee \u2026 a series of preconditions would have to be satisfied.\u201d\n\nSuch preconditions include HCI receiving a merger approval from the competition authorities; consent from the minister of trade and industry and the NLC for the \u201cstep-in rights\u201d and HCI should exercise its rights of oversight.\n\n\u201cHCI has no entitlement to be paid 1% administration fee by Zamani until such time as a merger approval is granted. Even if merger approval were to be granted, HCI would not be entitled to be paid the 1% administration fee for the period preceding the merger approval because that would amount to prior implementation of the merger,\u201d she said.\n\nCharmaine Mabuza said an interdict restraining Ithuba from paying salaries appeared to be directed at enforcing the arbitration award, which Ithuba and Zamani had already indicated they would oppose if it were to be made an order of the court.\n\nShe argued that Ithuba and Zamani would suffer massive prejudice if the court ordered that the management fee be paid to a law firm.\n\nZamani uses the management fee to pay its overheads and operational costs (which came in at R3.9 million in August) in relation to Ithuba.\n\nA further R5.2 million of the management fee was used to pay Ithuba\u2019s salary expenses.\n\n\u201cThe relief sought makes no provision for these expenses. Indeed, the relief sought would constitute a breach or repudiation by HCI of the management agreement since its conduct threatens to interfere with Ithuba\u2019s rights under the agreement to receive management services from Zamani, and threatens to prevent Zamani from performing its obligations,\u201d Charmaine Mabuza said.\n\nHCI has argued that its refusal of early repayment of the loan was because the \u201ctrue charecterisation\u201d of the funding it gave to Ithuba was that of an \u201cinvestment in a project\u201d.\n\n\u201cHCI does not look to make short-term investments ... HCI\u2019s investments would run for a number of years, most probably for the entire duration of the licence,\u201d it said in the arbitration hearing.\n\nThe step-in rights that HCI seeks to be confirmed by the court could see it take over the role of Zamani.\n\nIn August, when people protested outside HCI offices in Cape Town, the company said it was evident that those who were roped into the protest action had no clue about the funding arrangements.", "description": "Control of the country\u2019s biggest tender, the lottery operation, is set to pit Hosken Consolidated Investments (HCI), owners of free-to-air channel e.tv, and gambling power couple Eric and Charmaine Mabuza against each other this week.", "authors": ["Dumisane Lubisi And Abram Mashego"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9523/0b45c5810b214b0f8f2f29c0691ac53b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
