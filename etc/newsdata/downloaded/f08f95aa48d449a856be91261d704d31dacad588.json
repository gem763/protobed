Jessica Meir is set to become the 14th.\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library\n\nKoch and Meir are set to step outside in their Nasa spacesuits at around 12:50 BST (07:50 EDT).\n\nThey will make their way to a location called the Port 6 truss structure. Once here, they will have to replace the device, known as a battery charge-discharge unit (BCDU).\n\nOnce this task is complete, Koch and Meir will return to the airlock with the failed BCDU. The device will subsequently be loaded onto the next SpaceX Dragon resupply ship for inspection on Earth.\n\nIn March this year, Nasa announced that Koch would take part in the first all-female EVA with colleague Anne McClain.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption The Port 6 truss structure is at one end of the ISS\n\nHowever, the spacewalk was called off because a medium-sized suit wasn't available in the near-term for McClain.\n\nThe first woman to spacewalk was the Russian Svetlana Savitskaya, who went outside the USSR's Salyut 7 space station for three hours, 35 minutes on 25 July 1984. She was accompanied by fellow cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nasa unveiled the prototype for a new spacesuit that could be worn by the next astronauts on the Moon.\n\nIt said the new Moon suit, known formally as the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU), is designed to give the wearer a customised fit whatever their shape or size.", "description": "Two astronauts are about to make the first all-female spacewalk.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/EEDC/production/_109284116_spacewalk1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
