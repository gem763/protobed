UEFA needs to do far more to tackle this kind of abuse.\" EPA\n\nAhead of last night\u2019s explosive England game we were told the players would walk off if they faced abuse. In reality, only the first two steps of UEFA\u2019s three-step protocol were adhered to.\n\nThis was the first time that protocol has been enacted, and came after Tyrone Mings and Marcus Rashford were subjected to disgusting monkey chants by the Bulgarian crowd. As Mings let his anger show there was a sense of chaos in the stadium as the public address system declared the referee would consider abandoning the match due to \u201cracist behaviour\u201d.\n\nIt was, in its way, a historic moment. But it fell at the final hurdle.\n\nNow, as I stated at the beginning, I\u2019m not necessarily a fan of walking off the pitch at anytime, but if it is decided that we are willing to do so, then we must have the courage of our convictions and simply DO IT!\n\nSo, in the second half, when we were 4-0 up, and there was continued racism towards England\u2019s players, albeit less than the first half, we should have seen the inevitable result of our zero tolerance stance on racism, and the third step of that protocol SHOULD have been enforced.\n\nWe are used to the timidity of UEFA officials, and so it falls on the England players and staff to make the stand.\n\nBut we were winning 4-0, so we let our football do the talking. We scored a couple more. That was our answer to to the monkey chants and Nazi salutes: take the three points, and leave the stunning moment that could redefine football\u2019s relationship with racism for another team, another time.\n\nWe cannot claim to support the fight against racism, but for expediency\u2019s sake pick and choose when to enforce it. If you really want to take it seriously, just like millions of BAME people up and down the country are forced to every day, then don\u2019t insult us!\n\nThe ultimate lack of action left a job half done. It meant that Bulgaria manager Krasimir Balakov could go on TV after the game and claim not have heard the chants, or seen the salutes. He even tried to suggest that England fans whistling during the Bulgarian national anthem was somehow equivalent (to the chanting he didn\u2019t hear).\n\nIf England is going to walk off the field in the face of horrific racist abuse, it must NOT be determined by the scoreline. If we continue to do that, then we all end up losing.", "description": "When the idea about players walking off the pitch for racial abuse was spoken about a few years ago, I was never a great fan.
