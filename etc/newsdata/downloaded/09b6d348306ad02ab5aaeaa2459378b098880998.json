Lorenzo Reyes delivers this weeks power rankings and biggest risers and fallers. USA TODAY\n\nThe \"handshake-gate\" no one really asked for looks to be reaching its denouement.\n\nIt all started when San Francisco 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman blasted Cleveland Browns quarterback for allegedly not shaking his hand during the pregame captain's meeting before the 49ers throttled the Browns on Monday night.\n\nBut a video showing Sherman and Mayfield shaking hands circulated around social media Tuesday. Sherman called into the Pat McAfee Show hat in hand.\n\n\"It's definitely my bad,\" Sherman told McAfee. \"I never want anybody to have to deal with some (expletive), I mean, some stuff that they didn't do. And so, you know, the questions that he's gonna get and the annoying, nonsense questions about some stuff that happened in a game that's already been done, sure he'll get an apology for that. I'll probably reach out to him via text or social media to actually get a hold of him and talk to him in the person, I mean, on the phone.\n\n\"That was a great name you guys came up with. 'Dap-gate?' I was crying laughing,\" Sherman continued. \"He definitely deserves an apology, and that's my bad on that.\"\n\nWhen Mayfield was asked about it all Tuesday, he had a tongue-in-cheek response that poked fun at himself.\n\n\"I know what I did,\" he said. \"But that\u2019s the one time the camera recording me has gone in my favor.\"", "description": "49ers cornerback Richard Sherman said Wednesday he will apologize to Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield for misrepresenting their pregame handshake.", "authors": ["Chris Bumbaca", "Published P.M.
