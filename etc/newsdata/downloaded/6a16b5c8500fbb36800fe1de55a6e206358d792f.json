On Sunday, lawyers said a second whistleblower had come forward to substantiate that complaint.\n\nPOLITICAL APPOINTEE\n\nThe request for Sondland\u2019s appearance marked a shift for the investigation because he is a Trump donor and political appointee. Previous witnesses have been career officials, including the former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, and Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the U.S. Intelligence Community.\n\nSondland was a Seattle-based hotelier until Trump nominated him to his position as ambassador in May. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in June and presented his credentials at the European Commission in July.\n\nAnother career diplomat, Marie Yovanovitch, is scheduled to meet with the committees behind closed doors on Friday. Yovanovitch was the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until Trump recalled her in May before her term was up, after the president\u2019s supporters questioned her loyalty.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry has heightened bitter partisan divisions in Congress. Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans control the Senate while Democrats have a majority in the House.\n\nTrump has reacted furiously to the inquiry, using obscenities and insulting nicknames for Democratic lawmakers in posts on Twitter. Administration officials - and some Republican allies in Congress - have questioned whether they have any obligation to cooperate with the inquiry.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nThe White House was expected to tell Pelosi this week that it would ignore lawmakers\u2019 demands for documents until the House holds a vote to approve the impeachment inquiry.\n\nPelosi says a vote is not needed, although Democrats say the House would back the inquiry if there were a vote.\n\nThe impeachment investigation could lead to the approval by the House of formal charges against Trump.\n\nA trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the Republican-controlled Senate, where Trump continues to enjoy nearly unwavering support from members of his party.", "description": "The Trump administration on Tuesday blocked the U.S. ambassador to the European Union from giving testimony in the House of Representatives' impeachment investigation of the Republican president.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438467686&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9710C", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
