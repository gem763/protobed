He had scratches on the top of his lips and he had scratches on his nose.'\n\nMasua seems too frightened to return to school.\n\nMs Tusa said she plans on keeping him home and homeschooling for a while regardless.\n\nWhen asked about what happened to him, Ms Tusa said her son keeps repeating the words 'naughty teacher, mummy.'\n\n'I've asked him a couple of times (about the incident) and all he says is 'mummy, naughty teacher, mummy, naughty teacher'.\n\n'I want to know the full story, the story that they're (the kindergarten) are telling me doesn't add up. For the sake of my child, tell the truth.'\n\nAfter Ms Tusa saw her four-year-old's battered and bruised face she demanded to know why she wasn't contacted about her son's fall earlier.\n\n'We went to pick him up and didn't see him in the window. Usually he sits by a window looking out in the afternoon smiling and waiting for us,' she told Daily Mail Australia after the incident.\n\nWhen she and Masua's aunt arrived last Wednesday, she found his wheelchair up against a wall in the centre.\n\nMasua's mother has now pulled him from the school all together, saying its the second time they've let her down while caring for her only child\n\n'He was facing the wall playing with some little cars,' she said.\n\nIt wasn't until she spun his wheelchair around that she noticed the red wounds taking up half of his face.\n\nNobody from the school had contacted her to tell her Masua had been hurt, she said.\n\nWHAT IS CEREBRAL PALSY? Cerebral palsy is a movement disorder which affects muscle tone and flexibility. More than 34,000 people are living with cerebral palsy in Australia. The cause is largely unknown and there is no known cure. It is a lifelong condition. In 13 out of 14 cases of cerebral palsy in Australia, the brain injury leading to cerebral palsy occurs either in the uterus (while the mother is pregnant) or before one month of age.\n\nAn aunt, Leika Tusa, said his injuries looked like he'd been 'beaten up'.\n\nHis left eye was swollen shut, he had puss oozing from cuts to more than half his face and blood pouring from his nose.\n\nDue to Masua's limited verbal communication skills, he is unable to tell his parents exactly what happened.\n\nMasua's grandmother Mary Tusa told Daily Mail Australia that her grandson is 'a bright boy'.\n\n'He just can't talk very well, but he understands everything,' she said.\n\nShe said he's needing to have his wounds dressed and bandaged regularly, but that he is slowly recovering.\n\n'But we can't feel his pain,' she said.\n\nThe family have contacted police, who are currently investigating the matter.\n\nThe daycare centre, which Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to name, said in a statement to New Zealand Herald they are taking the matter seriously.\n\n'We're working with our head office and we're also working with the Ministry of Education, as well, to make sure that they know that we worked hard to try and do everything that we could for him,' they said.\n\nDue to Masua's limited verbal communication skills, he is unable to tell his parents exactly what happened", "description": "Masua Tusa, who has cerebral palsy and speech difficulties, was dazed and confused when his\u00a0mother came to pick him up from kindergarten in Auckland, New Zealand last Wednesday.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/06/19773134-0-image-a-212_1571202169255.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
