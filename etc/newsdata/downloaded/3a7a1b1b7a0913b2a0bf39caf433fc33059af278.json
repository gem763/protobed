(Mark J. Terrill/AP)\n\nAny hope that the NFL had put aside all of the consternation over last season\u2019s officiating woes quickly dissipated amid turmoil about the calls being made \u2014 and the calls being missed \u2014 by its officials in the first two weeks of the 2019 season.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints, infamously hurt by a non-call in the NFC championship game, have already been involved in debates over two calls, and among other issues, a roughing-the-passer penalty proved costly for the Denver Broncos. Questions have been raised in and around the NFL about the manner in which Al Riveron, the league\u2019s senior vice president of officiating, and his colleagues are administering the new rule that makes pass interference calls and non-calls subject to video review.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned,\u201d former NFL referee John Parry said Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what it is, but I know this: Fans don\u2019t want excuses. They don\u2019t want rationalization. They don\u2019t want to hear how fast the game is and how tough the job is. Al and the officiating department need to dig down, and they all need to come together and get it right.\u201d\n\n[How the NFL\u2019s pass interference instant replay rule will work in 2019]\n\nThe league and its competition committee moved swiftly during the 2018 season and in the offseason to address officiating issues. When there was an outcry early last season about a flurry of roughing-the-passer penalties, the competition committee intervened to clarify how it wanted the rule applied. The issue faded into the background as the season progressed. And after a missed pass-interference call in the NFC title game in January helped send the Los Angeles Rams, rather than the Saints, to the Super Bowl, owners voted in March to make interference reviewable.\n\nBut controversy has returned this season. Like Parry, fellow former NFL referee Terry McAulay said it\u2019s up to the officiating department, overseen by Riveron, to provide guidance to the officials to improve consistency and reduce mistakes.\n\n\u201cWhy are there errors? It appears to me that many officials are working using their own personal perspective of what is or is not a foul for pass interference, holding, roughing the passer, etc., which has led to inconsistencies from game to game,\u201d McAulay, now a rules analyst for NBC, wrote via email. \u201cThey seem to lack clearly identifiable standards for these very subjective fouls.\u201d\n\nThe league\u2019s focus during the offseason was devising a mechanism, through replay, that would avoid a repeat of the Saints-Rams fiasco. But that work was narrowly focused on pass interference. And this season\u2019s issues, at least so far, have not been related to one particular rule.\n\n\u201cFor me, it goes back to the play in January, and then we spent eight months talking about instant replay,\u201d said Parry, the referee for last season\u2019s Super Bowl and now a rules analyst for ESPN. \u201cInstant replay, to me, is a Band-Aid. It can\u2019t be the fix for officiating.\u201d\n\nThe problems have been coming fast and furious, and the Saints have been victimized twice. They beat the Houston Texans in their season opener, but the league acknowledged that a procedural mistake cost them 15 seconds during their final first-half drive when a 10-second clock runoff was done improperly.\n\nIn their defeat Sunday to the Rams in Los Angeles, the Saints lost a touchdown when an official blew the whistle in the middle of a fumble recovery return by defensive lineman Cameron Jordan. Instead of allowing the play to be completed and then using replay to determine whether Rams quarterback Jared Goff had lost a fumble or thrown an incomplete pass, the official blew the whistle, meaning replay could award the Saints possession of the ball but not a touchdown.\n\nCoach Sean Payton said it was \u201can awful call.\u201d Jordan likened the official to a Foot Locker employee. After the Week 1 clock mishap, quarterback Drew Brees said \u201cthat can\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\n[Saints fans cry foul after yet another bad call: \u2018We just want answers\u2019]\n\nThe Saints aren\u2019t alone in their frustration. The Broncos were upset about a roughing-the-passer call on Bradley Chubb for a seemingly legal hit on Chicago\u2019s Mitchell Trubisky that helped the Bears to a last-second victory Sunday.\n\nThere are various reasons for the issues. For one, NFL rules have become ever more complicated. Parry said the timing issue in the Saints-Texans game is addressed in four different places in the rule book, and the wording is slightly different each time. Also, the officials have become less experienced. The NFL promoted seven officials to referee, the head of the on-field crew, over the past two seasons, after departures of veteran refs. Not only are those new referees less experienced, they\u2019re surrounded by less experienced crews.\n\n\u201cIt does take time for any new referee to adapt to a whole new level of pressure, scrutiny and responsibility,\u201d McAulay said. \u201cEach of them are very good officials and, I would say, are probably better than I was my first couple of years, but there is still a significant learning curve.\u201d\n\nThen there is replay for pass interference. Much is being entrusted to Riveron. The NFL knew there would be growing pains and potential glitches when it instituted a rule that made a judgment call subject to replay for the first time. Tony Dungy, the former Super Bowl-winning coach, took it a step further: He said on NBC\u2019s studio show Sunday night that the new system has been, as he had feared, \u201ca disaster.\u201d\n\n[The NFL changed its replay rules after the Saints-Rams fiasco. Now comes the hard part.]\n\nOwners ratified the new system on a one-year basis, so it will be up for reconsideration after this season.\n\n\u201cI tried to go in with an open mind and say the glass is half full,\u201d Parry said. \u201cI\u2019m not there now. Do I think the glass is empty? No. Do I think it\u2019s a disaster? No. There is room to regroup. [But] we can\u2019t go 15 more weeks like this.\u201d\n\nMcAulay said he had \u201cbeen on record from Day One as adamantly opposed\u201d to the new replay rule.\n\n\u201cIt is the most subjective call in football,\u201d he said. \u201cI noted it would be extremely difficult to be consistent with decisions, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve seen so far.\u201d\n\nMore on the NFL:\n\nPower rankings, Week 3: Cowboys, Ravens move up as others suffer QB unrest\n\nSally Jenkins: Case Keenum is part of the solution, but the Redskins\u2019 problem might be too big\n\nAnalysis: Eli Manning getting benched for Daniel Jones was inevitable.
