Or, maybe you have, no judgement. But if anyone can pull off head-to-toe green lace, it\u2019s Cara Delevingne, with a little help from Rihanna and her lingerie line Savage x Fenty.\n\nWhile a neon-green bodysuit may be standard fare for Rihanna\u2019s label, the piece that really brings Delevingne\u2019s outfit together is the green riding crop with a heart-shaped rhinestone pad on the end. As sexcessories go, it\u2019s definitely easier to carry than a sex bench. Look closely at Delevingne\u2019s stockings and gloves, and you\u2019ll see \u201cSavage\u201d and \u201cFenty\u201d making up the honeycomb pattern. Plus, more rhinestones hanging off the end of her gloves.\n\nRihanna\u2019s hotly anticipated fashion show will air on Amazon on September 20, at which point you\u2019ll be able to shop the collection on Amazon and the Savage website. The show, which filmed during New York Fashion Week, was essentially a giant concert with incredible dancers, top models, and musical acts. It makes you think, Victoria\u2019s Secret could never. While you\u2019re waiting for the 20th, please enjoy these behind-the-scenes photos of Rihanna\u2019s models, including Bella Hadid, Gigi Hadid, and Paloma Elsesser. Featuring Bella as the hottest glass of orange juice you\u2019ve ever seen, Gigi as a flapper vixen crying silver tears, Paloma Elsesser as Cupid (with her own heart-shaped crop instead of a bow and arrow), and more!\n\nClockwise from left: Bella Hadid, Gigi Hadid Photo: Ilya S.
