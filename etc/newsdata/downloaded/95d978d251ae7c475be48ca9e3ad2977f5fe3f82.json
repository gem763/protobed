(Sept. 20) AP, AP\n\nCEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA \u2013 Former Vice President Joe Biden on Friday accused President Trump of \"abhorrent\" behavior amid news reports that the president pressured Ukraine's president to launch an investigation into Hunter Biden's business dealings in the country.\n\nBiden's comments come in the wake of multiple news reports that a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint with the inspector general overseeing the community concerning a phone call Trump made with a foreign leader.\n\nLawmakers are separately investigating whether Trump pushed for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe Biden's family's dealings in his country.\n\n\"If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump\u2019s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country,\" Biden said in a statement Friday evening. \"This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation \u2014 a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia \u2014 pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor.\"\n\nAsked earlier by reporters after a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, about reports that Trump wanted Biden's son Hunter to be investigated by the Ukrainian government, Biden offered only a brief comment defending his son.\n\n\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa ... wait a second. Not one single credible outlet has given credibility to these assertions. Not one single one,\" Biden said as he left a nature center where he had spoken at a town hall on climate issues. \"So I have no comment other than the president should start to be president.\u201d\n\nBiden added in an interview with the political blog Iowa Starting Line that he found it \"concerning to me that a president would do something like that.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally inappropriate for a president to try to get a foreign leader to say something that is untrue about any political opponent,\u201d Biden said in the interview. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of it before. I\u2019ve never heard of it before. But I think that Congress is looking into it, and I think they should.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the first-ever \"Workers' Presidential Summit\" at the Convention Center in Philadelphia, Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2019.

Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma.\n\nBut Ukraine's current prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.\n\n\u201cHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2014 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,\u201d Lutsenko told Bloomberg. \u201cA company can pay however much it wants to its board.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden and work with his personal attorney, Giuliani, on the matter.\n\n\"At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden has previously said he wanted Shokin out as prosecutor general because he wasn\u2019t doing enough to investigate corruption. The former vice president in March 2016 called on Ukraine\u2019s Parliament to dismiss Shokin, or the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees, according to the New York Times. Shokin was voted out by parliament, but no evidence showing Biden intentionally tried to benefit his son has surfaced.\n\nStill, Trump in a May interview on Fox News suggested Biden engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine's government.\n\n\u201cLook at Joe Biden \u2026 he calls them [Ukrainian government leaders] and says, 'Don\u2019t you dare prosecute,'\" Trump said in the interview. \"'If you don\u2019t fire this prosecutor\u2019 \u2014 the prosecutor was after his son \u2014 then he said, \u2018If you fire the prosecutor, you\u2019ll be OK. And if you don\u2019t fire the prosecutor, we\u2019re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,\u2019 or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?\"\n\nEarlier Friday, Trump called reports of the whistleblower complaint against him a \u201cridiculous story\u201d and said his communications with other leaders were \u201cat the highest level always appropriate.\u201d Asked by reporters Friday if he had raised questions about Biden's dealings in the Ukraine during a July phone call with Zelensky, Trump replied, \u201cSomeone ought to look into Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nHe said it \"doesn't matter\" if he asked the government of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and that it should be done anyway.\n\nTrump again attacked Biden in a Tweet on Saturday morning. He said his conversation with Zelensky was \"perfectly fine and routine.\" He added that, \"nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden\u2019s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster.\"\n\n....story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine. Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden\u2019s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. The Fake News knows this but doesn\u2019t want to report! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 21, 2019\n\nDemocratic presidential contender Kamala Harris came to Biden's defense and hammered Trump over reports that he sought foreign help to go after a political rival.\n\n\u201cHe has openly invited interference,\" the California senator told reporters prior to a speech in Waterloo, Iowa. \"And now we have information that suggests that, again, he has engaged in that kind of behavior. What he fails to understand is that he is the president of the United States, and that the office of the president of the United States is the people\u2019s office \u2014 not his office. And he may be afraid of a candidate in this election.\"\n\n\"Well then win on merit, but leave Joe Biden alone in terms of being in cahoots and collaborating with a foreign government to attack our democracy,\" Harris said. \"That\u2019s what this is about. It's really basic. Donald Trump appears to be collaborating with foreign governments to attack America\u2019s democracy.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Booker, another Democratic presidential contender, called Trump's reported attempts to pressure the Ukrainian president \"sober and serious stuff.\"\n\n\"It should be, in many ways, rocking Washington right now,\u201d Booker said on the sidelines of an LGBTQ campaign forum in Cedar Rapids Friday. \u201cThis is not a partisan issue. This is the president engaging in behavior that amounts to, at the very least, serious misconduct.\u201d\n\nA president is sitting in the Oval Office, right now, who continues to commit crimes. He continues because he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won\u2019t either. Today\u2019s news confirmed he thinks he\u2019s above the law. If we do nothing, he\u2019ll be right. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 20, 2019\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren wrote on Twitter that Congress' failure to impeach Trump following the release earlier this year of the Mueller report made it \u201ccomplicit in Trump\u2019s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo your constitutional duty and impeach the president,\u201d Warren added. \u201cA president is sitting in the Oval Office, right now, who continues to commit crimes. He continues because he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won\u2019t either. Today\u2019s news confirmed he thinks he\u2019s above the law. If we do nothing, he\u2019ll be right.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/20/joe-biden-trump-suggesting-hunter-biden-ukraine-wrongdoing-not-credible/2386593001/", "description": "\"Not one single credible outlet has given credibility to these assertions.
