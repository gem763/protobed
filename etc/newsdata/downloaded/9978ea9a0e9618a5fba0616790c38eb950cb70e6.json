Our student loan system may be broken but encouraging students to take out private loans some of which they will end up paying back double on is beyond disappointing. https://t.co/hR3Flkg8vE \u2014 Eva Crossan Jory (@EvaCrossanJory) August 22, 2019 Report\n\nEva Crossan Jory, vice president for welfare at the National Union of Students, said increasing numbers of students were resorting to using \"high-cost lenders\" as government-funded student maintenance loans often failed to cover living costs.\n\nA Department for Education spokesperson said government-funded loans were available to eligible students regardless of their financial background, and no commercial loans offered the same level of borrower protection.\n\n\"We have increased cash-in-hand living costs support for undergraduate students from the lowest income households by 2.8% for the current academic year - 2019/20 - and have announced a further 2.9% increase for 2020/21 - to record levels,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nHave you taken out a high-interest private loan to fund your education?
