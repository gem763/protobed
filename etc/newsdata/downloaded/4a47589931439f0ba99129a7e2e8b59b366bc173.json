There were also organising workshops and competitions for the best handmade kites, an craft which has deep roots in Gozo.\n\nVisit Malta explains on their website that in the past, they were used variously as a means to send messages by troops during wars, to measure distances, as royal sports or simply to give joy to children who had only paper and bamboo sticks to make their own toys..", "description": "The three-day festival included a competition for international teams of professional kite masters", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/77/02/1000x563_cmsv2_c43daf51-7ced-5dc4-b864-f521920207de-4247702.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
