But Andreas has grown in the last few games. His energy and running, chasing, he is a different sort of 10.\n\n\u201cThere is no use talking about who is not going to be here for a long, long time... Paul\u2019s been brilliant and he is a creative midfielder that we need, but then it is up to the others to step up.\u201d\n\nUnited were ruthless in a 4-0 win over Chelsea on the opening weekend of the season but Solskjaer does not expect a similar scoreline at Stamford Bridge.\n\nFrank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea are on a seven-game winning run in all competitions, with youngsters Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori cementing their first-team positions after spending last season on loan.\n\n\u201cIt is a very exciting team,\u201d said Solskjaer. \u201cFrank has got players that have been on loan for one or two seasons in the Championship.\n\n\u201cThe difference between my youngsters is that they are almost stepping right now onto the scene.\u201d\n\nUnited youngsters Brandon Williams and James Garner could make their first domestic starts against Chelsea after playing in the last two Europa League matches.\n\n\u201cWe have not made a decision on who is going to play, but you will probably see the two of them,\u201d Solskjaer added.\n\n\u201cCharacter will be revealed in tough times, but I think they have done excellent, the young kids... I couldn\u2019t be any more happy with many of the youngsters.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has backed Fred and Andreas Pereira to bring energy and creativity to his team's midfield in the absence of the injured Paul Pogba.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446159135&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0TZ", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
