Bowser (D), center, reaches to shake hands with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), right, after the House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing about D.C. statehood on Thursday. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nU.S. lawmakers on Thursday held the first hearing on D.C. statehood since 1991. Here is what you need to know:\n\nQ: What was the aim of the hearing?\n\nA: The hearing was an opportunity for members of the House Oversight and Reform Committee to hear testimony and question witnesses about the D.C. statehood bill written by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), the District\u2019s nonvoting representative in Congress.\n\nWith their party in control of the House, Democrats are confident their bill can pass that chamber this session. But Republicans oppose creating a state that would be a Democratic stronghold, and Norton and others acknowledge the legislation has no chance in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\n\u201cThe way in which bills move is one house at a time,\u201d Norton said. \u201cI think getting this bill through the House is more than halfway there. So we\u2019ve got that in the bank.\u201d\n\nHer bill has more than 200 co-sponsors, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\n\n\nFormer D.C. mayor Vincent Gray, left, greets Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), after the hearing Thursday. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) is at the right. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nThe 1991 bill failed badly on the House floor.\n\nQ: What is the argument for statehood?\n\nA: In addition to abiding by a foundational notion \u2014 no taxation without representation \u2014 statehood would allow true self-government in the nation\u2019s capital, supporters say.\n\nResidents elect a chief executive (the mayor) and a legislature (the D.C. Council), but Congress can override laws passed by the District\u2019s elected officials.\n\nQ: Can D.C. afford statehood?\n\nA: In 1995, the federal government appointed a control board to manage the city\u2019s then-dismal finances, stripping the District government of much of its limited autonomy.\n\nBut today\u2019s reality is \u201ca far cry from the image many still harbor about the District,\u201d D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said Thursday.\n\nThe Revitalization Act, a bill negotiated and passed by a Republican-led Congress as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, helped rescue the city from the brink of bankruptcy by shifting certain costs to the federal government.\n\nWith 700,000 residents and a thriving tax base, the District can more than support itself financially, he said.\n\nJeffrey S. DeWitt, the District\u2019s chief financial officer, said that some functions currently managed by the federal government would fall to the new state.\n\nQ: What do opponents say?\n\nA: Roger Pilon, a constitutional scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, has cited several objections to statehood. The framers did not want a tiny federal enclave surrounded by a single state, as Norton\u2019s bill prescribes, he said.\n\n\u201cThat is particularly what James Madison feared,\u201d he said. \u201cHe spoke of dependency and interdependency. The federal government would be depending on a state for all manner of goods and services.\u201d\n\nPilon argued that Congress doesn\u2019t have the power to make the District a state simply by passing legislation.\n\nIf Norton\u2019s bill were to pass, he said, the 23rd Amendment, which gives District residents the right to vote for president, would have to be repealed. Otherwise, the few residents left in the federal enclave \u2014 such as the first family and a smattering of others \u2014 would control all three of the District\u2019s electoral votes, which statehood proponents say should go to the new state.\n\nPilon also said Maryland would have to agree to make the District a state, because Maryland originally ceded land for the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 not for \u201ca new state on its border.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nDistrict officials make case for D.C. statehood in face of GOP opposition\n\nThis black-owned D.C. funeral home has no one left to bury\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "A primer on the goal of the House oversight hearing and what\u2019s next for the District.", "authors": ["Jenna Portnoy", "Reporter Covering Virginia", "Maryland", "D.C.
