Photograph: Avener Prado/The Guardian\n\n\u201cThe Amazon is not burning, not burning at all,\u201d Brazil\u2019s foreign minister, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, insisted in an interview with CNN.\n\nRond\u00f4nia\u2019s governor, a Bolsonaro ally called Marcos Rocha, took an identicial line, dismissing the \u201cfuss\u201d over the fires as a foreign ruse to shackle Brazil\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cIf we look at the situation in other countries, their forests are burning much more than here in our Brazil,\u201d the retired police colonel claimed.\n\n\u201cYou go to London, or other countries, and what do you see?\u201d Rocha mused.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fog \u2013 it\u2019s smoke! Smoke from burning; from industry. So how can they demand of us what they haven\u2019t done themselves?\u201d\n\nJo\u00e3o Chris\u00f3stomo, a Bolsonarian congressman in Rond\u00f4nia\u2019s capital, Porto Velho, rejected claims that under his leader Brazil was entering a new era of Amazon devastation and insisted \u2013 contrary to a growing body of evidence \u2013 that conservation was a top priority in Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A billboard in support of Jo\u00e3o Chris\u00f3stomo, a Bolsonarian congressman in the Amazon state of Rond\u00f4nia.

He\u2019s not even from the Americas,\u201d the politician seethed.\n\n\u201cThis forest isn\u2019t shared, as he claims. It belongs to a nation which enjoys complete autonomy and authority to decide what happens to the forest and takes every possible care to preserve it.\u201d\n\nThat last claim rang hollow this week as the Guardian travelled almost 2,000km by road and river through two of the Amazon states most affected by this year\u2019s fires, Rond\u00f4nia and Amazonas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The main street of the small settlement of Palmeiras.

Photograph: Avener Prado/The Guardian\n\nAlong the way, an almost identical refrain emerged from the mouths of indigenous leaders, wildcat goldminers, environmental activists and government officials alike: that Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s stripping back of environmental protections and anti-environmental rhetoric had contributed to the scale of this year\u2019s fires \u2013 more than 30,000 of which were recorded in August alone \u2013 and set in motion a new age of wrecking that looks set to continue well beyond the end of the annual burning season next month.\n\n\u201cIt is chaos. Chaos, chaos, chaos,\u201d lamented one senior official from Brazil\u2019s environmental agency, Ibama, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cIf we go on like this, things will get worse and worse,\u201d predicted the official, diplomatically blaming the spike in Amazon deforestation during Bolsonaro\u2019s first eight months in power on the \u201cpolitical situation\u201d in Brazil.\n\nLife has never been easy for the activists and government agents seeking to slow rainforest destruction in a vast and often lawless region many still call Brazil\u2019s \u201cfaroeste\u201d (wild west).\n\nIn the riverside town of Humait\u00e1 in Amazonas state, Ibama\u2019s former headquarters lies in ruins two years after it was stormed, ransacked and burned to the ground by illegal goldminers in retribution for a crackdown.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ibama\u2019s former headquarters in Humait\u00e1 lies in ruins having been wrecked by illegal goldminers two years ago Photograph: Avener Prado/The Guardian\n\nNow, as the dismantling of Brazil\u2019s environmental protection system gathers pace, its operations there are to halt altogether.\n\nThree regional Ibama offices \u2013 in the towns of Humait\u00e1, Parintins and Tabatinga \u2013 are in the process of being deactivated, leaving only one central command post \u2013 in the capital, Manaus \u2013 to tackle environmental crime in a state three times the size of Spain.\n\nIn a recent letter to Ibama\u2019s new president, several hundred officials voiced \u201cimmense concern\u201d over the direction environmental protection was taking.\n\nM\u00e1rcio Tenharim, an indigenous leader from a reserve near Humait\u00e1, said he feared the influx of soy farmers, ranchers and mining companies would accelerate as Brazil\u2019s president pushed for such activities to be allowed on previously protected areas.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t ready for this,\u201d said Tenharim, predicting such \u201cdevelopment\u201d would bring \u201cnothing but misery\u201d for his people.\n\nBolsonaro denies that will be the case \u2013 and many in the region see his Amazon blueprint as a boon.\n\nBolsonaro backers wage war on the rainforest Read more\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s our hope for improvement,\u201d said Martins Tavares, 33, a goldminer who said he and virtually all of his colleagues backed Bolsonaro, believing his promises to open up the Amazon would help them feed their families.\n\nRui Souza, the owner of waterside petrol station in Humait\u00e1 that sells to goldseekers, said he was also optimistic the president would do away with environmental and indigenous reserves so they could be commercially exploited.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An indigenous village called Panual near the community of Palmeiras in Rond\u00f4nia state\n\nPhotograph: Avener Prado/The Guardian\n\n\u201cOur Amazonia is so rich, my friend.

Bolsonarian billboards dot the highways declaring: \u201cTogether we will change the destiny of Rond\u00f4nia and Brazil!\u201d\n\n\u201cNearly everyone here voted for him,\u201d said Vicente Costa, a 69-year-old restaurant owner in the town of Araras whose silver SUV was plastered with Bolsonaro stickers reading: \u201cChange Brazil for real.\u201d\n\nThat delight contrasts with the growing despair of many forest dwellers whose lives were upended in the 1960s when Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship bulldozed roads through the Amazon.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A forest fire near Palmeiras, an isolated town in the Amazon state of Rond\u00f4nia.

But we don\u2019t want to share our land,\u201d said Valdillene Urumon, 28, as the fire continued to rage near her village.\n\n\u201cWe felt sad [when Bolsonaro won],\u201d Urumon added. \u201cBut now we have to fight, don\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nChris\u00f3stomo insisted fears for the future of Brazil\u2019s forests were \u201ctotally misplaced\u201d.\n\nBut on the rural outskirts of Humait\u00e1 another blaze had broken out and as night fell two local firefighters battled in vain to contain it.\n\n\u201cThe environment is so crucial to us, isn\u2019t it?,\u201d one soot-faced firefighter said as he paused from smothering the flames with a rubber damper. \u201cIt saddens us to see it being destroyed like this.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Firefighters from Amazonas state fight to put out a fire on the rural outskirts of Humait\u00e1.
