But how can they not be?\n\nHe was a first-round pick in 2017. He has four career sacks. He was a healthy scratch Sunday.\n\n\u201cWell, I think it speaks to our depth,\u201d Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Sunday. \u201cI think it speaks to the talent level, and I think it speaks to the guys who did dress out, how they have earned that first game start. I think it\u2019s more about the positive part of it than it is anything negative. I\u2019m confident that . . . Charlton can line up out there with the starting group and play and play well.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBut Charlton hasn\u2019t shown that yet, and his time with the Cowboys could be running out. It would not come as a surprise if the Cowboys traded him before the trade deadline, perhaps for a safety.\n\nCharlton made three tackles, two sacks, two forced fumbles, a pass breakup and a fumble recovery in 19 snaps in the third preseason game. It was not enough for him to dress in the season opener.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just competing,\u201d Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said. \u201cHe\u2019s competing for an opportunity to get a jersey on Sunday. That\u2019s what we ask from our guys. You try to build a roster that\u2019s competitive, so you\u2019re competing to make the roster, make the 46 and then you compete for playing time. So he\u2019s just in that mix right now.\u201d\n\nIt would be one thing if Charlton weren\u2019t a first-round draft pick. But he was, and Charlton has not lived up to expectations, which is why the Cowboys could move on if they can get something of value for him.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing we try to do is, it doesn\u2019t matter where you came from; it just matters what you do,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cAnd so, you know, we\u2019re going to try to play the best guys. We\u2019re going to give everybody an opportunity to show that they can play and have a role, and choose the best one. The guys are going to help us be the best football team. Again, it doesn\u2019t really matter where you come from, it\u2019s just what you\u2019re doing for us right now and how you can help us.\u201d", "description": "The Cowboys continue to insist they are not disappointed in defensive end Taco Charlton.
