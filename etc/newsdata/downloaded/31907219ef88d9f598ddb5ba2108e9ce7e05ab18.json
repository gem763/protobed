Trump rejected the report as fake news and \"presidential harassment.\"\n\nThe inspector general's testimony at a closed-door meeting of the House intelligence committee was described by three people with knowledge of the proceedings. They were not authorized to discuss the meeting and were granted anonymity.\n\nThe Washington Post reported the complaint involves an intelligence official's allegation that Trump made the promise to an unidentified foreign leader in a telephone call. The Post cited two anonymous former U.S. officials.\n\nThe Associated Press has not confirmed the report.\n\nIntelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff, Democrat from California, had said inspector general Michael Atkinson determined the whistleblower complaint was \"credible and urgent\" and should be \"transmitted to Congress.\"\n\nHouse intelligence chairman Adam Schiff has issued subpoenas to further investigate the matter, though a senior intelligence official said in a letter it did not rise to the level of being an 'urgent concern.' (Susan Walsh/The Associated Press)\n\nSchiff has said the committee learned the complaint involved \"confidential and potentially privileged communication.\" In issuing a subpoena for the acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire to appear before the panel, Schiff said the complaint had not been transmitted to Congress within 10 days \"in violation of the law.\"\n\nThe situation raises Democrats' concerns that the intelligence community might be under pressure from the administration to withhold information from Congress. Maguire, a former navy official, was named acting director in August after the departure of director Dan Coats, who often clashed with the president, and the retirement of Sue Gordon, a career professional in the No. 2 position.\n\nSchiff noted in his letter seeking Maguire's testimony that \"your office consulted the Department of Justice about the complaint even though the statute does not provide you discretion to review\" the inspector general's findings, \"let alone to involve another entity within the executive branch.\"\n\n'I would only do what is right,' says Trump\n\n\"Another Fake News story out there \u2014 It never ends!\" Trump tweeted. \"Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!\"\n\nHe asked: \"Is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call.\"\n\n....Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u201cheavily populated\u201d call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA! \u2014@realDonaldTrump\n\nHe added that, \"I would only do what is right anyway.\"\n\nAtkinson testified behind closed doors at the Capitol, but it appeared he did not disclose details to lawmakers. Instead, the appearance mainly involved a discussion of the process for whistleblower complaints, the sources said.\n\nMaguire has refused to discuss details.\n\n'Credible and urgent' complaint: Schiff\n\nSchiff subpoenaed Maguire, saying he was withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioning whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general. Maguire is expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26.\n\nBoth Atkinson and Maguire are to appear next week before the Senate intelligence committee, according to Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the panel.\n\nRep. Jim Himes, Democrat from Connecticut, said Thursday on MSNBC that the acting director \"broke the law when he decided to basically intercept the inspector general's report to Congress.\"\n\nIn this July file photo, Rep. Jim Himes testifies before the House intelligence committee on Capitol Hill. On Thursday, Himes stated lawmakers are in the dark when it comes to the whistleblower complaint. (Andrew Harnik/The Associated Press)\n\nThat's \"never been done before in the history of inspector general reports to the Congress,\" Himes said. \"And the American people should be worried about that.\"\n\nHimes said ahead of the meeting that lawmakers are in the uncomfortable position of not knowing any more than what's in the news reports.\n\n\"We don't know exactly what is in the substance of this complaint,\" he said. \"It could be nothing. It could be something very, very serious.\"\n\nSchiff did not divulge the subject of the complaint, but said the committee \"places the highest importance on the protection of whistleblowers and their complaints to Congress.\"\n\nIn a letter Tuesday, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of \"urgent concern.\" He said the complaint \"concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to 'intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision.\"\n\nSchiff said last week that Maguire is required to share the complaint with Congress and said the attempt to hold it back \"raises serious concerns about whether White House, Department of Justice or other executive branch officials are trying to prevent a legitimate whistleblower complaint from reaching its intended recipient, the Congress, in order to cover up serious misconduct.\"", "description": "The government's intelligence watchdog declined Thursday to discuss the substance of a whistleblower complaint that reportedly concerns President Donald Trump making an unspecified promise to a foreign leader.
