Greg Miller unpacks the shadow agenda pursued by Rudolph W. Giuliani in Ukraine. And Samantha Schmidt on the future of the Boy Scouts.\n\nPost Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nTakeaways from the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\n\nPresident Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate unfounded corruption allegations against political rival Joe Biden, according to a rough transcript of the phone call at the center of accusations that the president pressured a foreign leader as he held up aid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor,\u201d Trump said in response to Zelensky raising the prospect of acquiring military equipment from the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose statements and others in the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky reflected a possible violation of campaign finance law to the intelligence community inspector general. Officials referred the matter to the Justice Department in late August, but prosecutors last week concluded that the conduct was not criminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know from our reporting that the president before this call had directed his budget director and his acting chief of staff to freeze military aid to Ukraine,\u201d says intelligence reporter Shane Harris . \u201cHe does not specifically say to Zelensky in this call, \u2018Unless you investigate these people, I won\u2019t give you the aid,\u2019 but the context of that is all over this call.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe whistleblower complaint that unearthed the call has rocked the White House and prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to initiate an impeachment inquiry against Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Freelancing in a very nakedly political way\u2019\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s attempt to leverage information about former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter from the president of Ukraine followed a months-long battle inside the administration \u2014 one that sidelined national security leaders and empowered political loyalists such as the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, say current and former U.S. officials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGiuliani, more than a year ago, began fixating on Ukraine and trying to insert himself into the U.S. relationship with that country,\u201d says intelligence reporter Greg Miller\n\n\n\n\n\nGiuliani was a key player in the escalating political conflict over Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, pushing for the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and seizing an unofficial diplomatic role for himself. Earlier this year, the former New York City mayor even planned to travel to Ukraine to push for investigations that could benefit Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s not doing is advancing the interests of the United States,\u201d Miller says. \u201cHe\u2019s not negotiating things that are consistent with American foreign policy objectives in the region. He is freelancing in a very nakedly political way.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nScout leaders make their case for recruitment\n\nWith the start of a new school year, Boy Scout leaders have been tasked with safeguarding the future of their organization.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut looming over the Boy Scouts are sexual abuse lawsuits that threaten to tarnish the organization\u2019s image, reports of potential bankruptcy and a sometimes alienating struggle to define what it means to be a Scout today. The scandals make it that much more difficult for leaders to recruit as numbers decline, says reporter Samantha Schmidt , who attended a back-to-school recruitment night.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Shane Harris examines the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call to Ukraine.
