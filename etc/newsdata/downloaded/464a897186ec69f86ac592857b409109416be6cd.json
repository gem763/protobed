Just a massive body,\" said McDaniel. \"His upper half of body was out of the water; his dorsal fin was out of the water.\"\n\n(MORE: Family of woman killed by sharks in Bahamas recalls daughter's last moments)\n\nPHOTO: Danny McDaniel was kayaking off of Catalina Island in California on Oct. 5, 2019, when a great white shark bit his kayak. (Handout via KGTV) More\n\nIt was a great white shark -- estimated to be 19-feet-long \u2013 clamped down onto the back of McDaniel\u2019s 9-foot-long kayak and only inches away from McDaniel himself.\n\n\u201cI completely froze \u2026 the primary thought on top of everything else was don\u2019t fall into the water. Other thoughts were oh my God, this thing is giant,\u201d said McDaniel.\n\n\"[I] look at it and said, 'oh crap, oh crap, oh crap',\" said Chambers. \"I yelled at him to hit it,\" Chambers said of his initial reaction to seeing the giant shark.\n\nBoth men just froze in fear while the great white held onto the kayak for around 5 seconds before it loosened its grip, turned to move between the two men\u2019s kayaks and disappeared into the depths.\n\nThe men cautiously made their way back to shore where they found puncture marks on the kayak, several scratches, and two giant teeth embedded in the kayak.\n\n\"I don't think he took a full chomp. I think he just took a nibble and pushed,\" said McDaniel. \u201cI am grateful, obviously, that I didn\u2019t get injured. It wasn\u2019t my time I suppose.\u201d\n\n(MORE: Bag found by searchers looking for Florida firefighters who vanished on fishing trip)\n\nIn spite of the terrifying incident, both men told KGTV that the experience wouldn\u2019t keep them out of the water. In fact, they even completed their scuba diving trip later that evening.\n\n\"I think I've had my fill of great white sharks; I'm good. But I'm fortunate to have this experience,\" McDaniel said.\n\n\u201cHe literally encountered the largest fish I have ever seen in 20 years of scuba diving and he came away from it unscathed. That is one for the books. It is not something you want to replicate,\u201d said Chambers.", "description": "Two men are lucky to be alive after a shark attacked them on a kayaking trip over the weekend leaving massive bite marks on their vessel \u2013 and two huge teeth.
