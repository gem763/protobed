The change left Liverpool with four up front and the Belgian played a pivotal part in the goal.\n\nPicking up the ball on the left, his cross was headed out to Wijnaldum on the edge of the area. As the midfielder shot, there appeared no obvious danger but the otherwise impressive Henderson somehow allowed the ball to slip through his hands and between his legs.\n\nIt was rough justice on United who were punished for one lapse in concentration in an otherwise excellent 90 minutes. Even then, they piled men forward until the final whistle in a desperate search for the equaliser.\n\nKlopp admitted he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d by his side\u2019s performance. \u201cThese games, they are not all beauties and you have to work hard for the results,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI was frustrated, and at halftime we spoke about it. We started well, but you have to do the same things again and again. It\u2019s about body language, it starts with the centre halves, it\u2019s the little things.\u201d\n\nThe result put Liverpool on 21 points with United in 10th place on eight.", "description": "Liverpool extended their perfect start to the season with a seventh successive Premier League victory, beating Sheffield United 1-0 after home keeper Dean Henderson fumbled Georginio Wijnaldum's 70th-minute shot at Bramall Lane on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434896262&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0GJ", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
