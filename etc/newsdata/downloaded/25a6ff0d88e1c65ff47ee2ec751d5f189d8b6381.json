For example, they scored eight per cent lower on average in the 'missing pieces' test.\n\nThis involved looking at various geometric shapes and identifying the missing piece from five options.\n\nThose with the amyloid-beta plaques got 23 out of 32 items correct on average in adulthood - two points fewer than participants without the clumps.\n\nThis suggests small differences in cognitive tests, potentially caused by amyloid plaques, are detectable years before dementia symptoms occur, Professor Schott said.\n\nHowever, commenting on the study, Dr Ashok Jansari, of Goldsmiths, University of London, said: 'There was no statistical difference in the scores of the adults who did show the plaques and who didn\u2019t.'\n\nThe presence of the plaques was not connected childhood cognitive skills. Neither was it linked to sex, education or socioeconomic status.\n\nDr Jansari said: 'Given that the plaques are the only current biological marker of Alzheimer\u2019s, there is no relationship at all to be found here.'\n\nDr Matthew Iveson, a senior data scientist, University of Edinburgh, said: 'The study does not claim that those performing poorly on the tests have, or will get dementia.\n\n'It just looks at performance on a battery of cognitive tests that may help to detect the subtle cognitive decline that precedes dementia.'\n\nDr Carol Routledge, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK which part funded the study, said one explanation for the link between childhood and adulthood brain power may be 'cognitive reserve'.\n\nIt's the idea that memory and thinking skills we acquire during our lives through education provides a resilience, known as cognitive reserve.\n\nResearch has shown that people with greater cognitive reserve are better able to stave off symptoms of degenerative brain changes seen in diseases like dementia.\n\n'But more research is needed to better understand this link', Dr Routledge said.\n\n'This study sheds more light on the complex relationship between memory and thinking skills in early life and our cognitive ability as we get older.'\n\nDementia affects around 850,000 people in the UK - a figure set to rise to two million by 2050. In the US, it's estimated there are 5.7million dementia sufferers.\n\nWith no cure in sight there is an increasing focus on identifying those most at risk to enable the adoption of preventative measures.\n\nA limitation of the study is that all participants were white, so the results may not represent the general population.", "description": "Participants in a study who scored low in mental tests at the age of eight had worse memory by their 70s, researchers at University College London found.", "authors": ["Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20381648-0-image-a-89_1572448649591.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
