He was 32.\n\nThere had initially been speculation Genest's death was a suicide.\n\nIn her report, Gagnon notes Genest had a history of mental health problems and had sought treatment.\n\nBut he was \"happy in the weeks preceding his death\" and had recently gotten engaged.\n\n\"His friends also stated that he was highly motivated by his new artistic projects.\"\n\nThe report said a fall from the balcony was the most \"likely scenario,\" given that he was highly intoxicated.\n\nA toxicological analysis found he had a blood alcohol level three times the legal driving limit. He had a habit of sitting on the railing when he went outside for a cigarette, family members told the coroner.\n\n\"After analysis, given that the investigation did not reveal a clear and unequivocal intention to end his life on Mr. Genest's part, I cannot state that the death was a suicide,\" Gagnon wrote in her report.\n\nRise to fame with Lady Gaga\n\nGenest, who was a squeegee kid as a youth in Montreal, came to the public's attention after tattooing his body from head to toe, including images of a skull and brain on his head.\n\nHe set a Guinness World Record, which has since been surpassed, for most insect tattoos (176) and another for most human bone tattoos (139).\n\nHis body art attracted fashion designers, and he modelled at high-end shows in Paris and Berlin. In 2011, he appeared in Lady Gaga's music video for the song Born This Way.\n\nLady Gaga originally referred to Genest's death as a suicide and then later apologized, saying she did not mean to draw an \"unjust conclusion.\"\n\n\"The art we made was sacred to me and I was emotional, he was an incredible artist and his art and heart will live on,\" she wrote on Twitter last year.\n\nFriends relieved\n\nOn Monday, Sam Watts, the head of Welcome Hall Mission, a Montreal community organization, recalled Genest's contributions as a volunteer after, years earlier, using their services.\n\nIn 2018, Genest worked with the mission on a campaign to raise awareness about the challenges facing youth on the streets.\n\n\"He wanted to use his fame and his notoriety to bring attention to the cause of youth homelessness,\" Watts said.\n\n\"He was a fascinating individual. You had this exterior that looked a certain way but it didn't reflect the interior and also the caring he had for other young people.\"\n\nRick Genest's friend, Karim Leduc, right, and Micah Genest, his brother, attended the release of the coroner's report Monday. (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada)\n\nKarim Leduc, Genest's friend and former manager, said he will be remembered as a unique artist and poet, and a generous person.\n\nHe said it was a \"relief to finally have this chapter come to a close publicly,\" when it had long been clear to those closest to him that Genest's death was an accident.\n\n\"For us to be able to move on and to know that the world has the same side of the story as we have is a relief,\" he said.", "description": "Rick Genest, known as Zombie Boy, fell off a balcony\u00a0in Montreal's Plateau\u2013Mont-Royal borough last August, according to a coroner's report released Monday.
