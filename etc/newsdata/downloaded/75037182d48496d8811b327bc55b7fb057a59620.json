Technology is the future, everyone knows that; but how do you claim your share of that future when you\u2019re competing with America, China, the EU, and India?\n\nHow do you build a thriving ecosystem of tech wealth and tech education \u2014 successful international businesses whose alumni found and invest in burgeoning startups \u2014 when you face the triple threats of a small population, limited capital, and a potential brain drain? Even nations as wealthy and successful as my homeland Canada often struggle with this.\n\nSo imagine what it\u2019s like for, say, Armenia, from which I write, a former Soviet republic turned tiny nation of three million, sandwiched between unfriendly neighbors in the Caucasus Mountains. I\u2019m here because the Armenian government is, at obvious expense1, hosting one of the world\u2019s seemingly countless / endless Major Tech Conferences, this time the World Congress of Information Technology, presumably in the hopes of garnering international attention for \u2014 and investment in \u2014 Armenia\u2019s tech sector.\n\nThis may seem quixotic. Armenia styles itself as \u201cthe Silicon Valley of the former Soviet Union,\u201d and its tech sector is successful enough to have played a prominent role in last year\u2019s \u2018velvet revolution.\u2019 But it\u2019s still a country of three million in a relatively obscure corner of the world. However, Armenia has a fascinating secret weapon \u2014 its diaspora.\n\nThanks to their homeland\u2019s troubled 20th-century history, many more Armenians live scattered around the world than in Armenia proper, including, most famously, hundreds of thousands in Los Angeles. It is \u201cone of the largest and most sophisticated diasporas in the world.\u201d Obviously there\u2019s cultural drift \u2014 but at the same time, I\u2019m repeatedly assured it\u2019s a rare Armenian who doesn\u2019t have a distant friend or relative in L.A. and/or Moscow.\n\nThe effects of this unusually large and loose-knit diasporal web are significant. It leads, sometimes directly, often indirectly, to American clients, German universities, and Russian partners; to international connections to venture capitalists and startup incubators; to brain gain as well as drain. It means Armenia isn\u2019t just a landlocked nation of three million, but the beating cultural heart of ten million, inadvertently strategically scattered across the globe. That\u2019s a far, far stronger position.\n\nI\u2019ve argued before that as technology shortens and tightens the bonds between distributed communities, they\u2019ll grow more significant, culturally, financially, and eventually politically. (And of course tech also makes entire sub-industries even possible; one of WCIT\u2019s sponsors here is a slick and fast-growing crowdfunding marketing company, not exactly a traditional strength of the former Soviet bloc.) The Armenian diaspora is almost a natural experiment testing this theory.\n\nThis natural experiment will test whether this secret weapon will help Armenia continue to punch further and further above its weight in technology, tourism, and other diaspora-enhanced fields. If that happens, and I expect it to, it will be especially interesting to see which other distributed communities follow in its wake \u2026 and whether those will be affiliated with any nation-state at all.\n\n1Including paying the travel costs for your correspondent.
