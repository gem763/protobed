And we think as long as we\u2019re doing that, Google will win too.\u201d\n\nWith that said, developers can choose to make their apps or games exclusive to the Google Play Pass program in the Google Play Store, but they\u2019re not required to do so.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for developers?\n\nThrough Google Play Pass, developers earn royalties based on the amount of time spent in their apps, and Google will be \u201ccontinuously refining the model to make sure developers are rewarded fairly,\u201d Shoemaker said.\n\nDevelopers also get useful and valuable data, too. Without the payment barrier, developers can see what features people like when they\u2019re not obstructed by paywalls. \u201cIt\u2019s all about trying to identify what content is really making users happy and delivering value so that they are satisfied with the overall experience,\u201d Shoemaker said.\n\nAnd without a payment barrier, Shoemaker said that Play Pass can free developers from monetization pressures, and it gives them greater freedom to create better apps and experiences.\n\nWithout a payment barrier, Play Pass subscribers may be more willing to try lesser-known paid apps and games that they wouldn\u2019t have paid for out of uncertainty. Google highlighted certain less-familiar titles in its Play Pass announcement blog like \u201cLIMBO,\u201d \u201cLichtspeer,\u201d \u201cMini Metro,\u201d and \u201cOld Man\u2019s Journey.\u201d\n\nGoogle Play Pass Subscribers will find a new Play Pass tab \u2013 it looks like a Google-branded movie ticket \u2013 on the bottom of the Google Play Store where they\u2019ll be able to browse apps and games. Apps and games in the Google Play Pass program will also have the Play Pass ticket symbol when you browse normally through the Google Play Store.", "description": "Business Insider - Google's Play Pass lets you roam freely in a short list of paid apps and games without any payment barriers or ads, and the list will grow over time..
