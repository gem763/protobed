But let\u2019s not let facts get in the way.\n\nThen Democrats promised reparations to single Americans because they didn\u2019t get the marriage benefit on their tax returns. Nevermind that the tax code was intentionally supposed to encourage marriage.\n\nNow it\u2019s the LGBT community. They too missed the tax benefits available to married families so, of course, the solution is taxpayer-funded reparations.\n\nThe whole reparation theme seeks to make us all into victims; all of us who aren\u2019t white males anyway. Their politics of victimization gives us someone to blame, even people to hate. Then they step forward as our champions, ready to channel our grievances, real or just perceived, happy to take control of our lives.\n\nSecond is tax increases.\n\nWithout exception, Democrats don\u2019t just want a return to the high taxes of Barack Obama. Obama\u2019s taxes weren\u2019t high enough. On top of his taxes, they want to add the following:\n\nRaise income taxes on the rich to 80%. Nevermind that \u201cthe rich\u201d already pay three-quarters of all the taxes raised in America. And bear in mind \u201crich\u201d is a moving target. Considering the average Venezuelan makes less than $500 annually, every American is rich. Venezuela is especially relevant because Venezuela\u2019s economic system is what Democrats Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren want our system to become.\n\nThen there\u2019s the asset tax. Actually the asset tax gives taxes a bad name. It\u2019s actually a confiscation plan. Some Democrats suggest if a person has assets above a certain amount the government should take 1% to 2% each year.\n\nAnd of course the transaction tax. The transaction tax applies anytime stocks are traded. The tax applies to 401(k)s, pensions, and any other stock transaction. And whether you lose money or not, the trade is taxed.\n\nAnd don\u2019t overlook the new, not-yet-defined, Medicare-for-All tax. The candidates won\u2019t tell us how much this tax will cost because it will be big -- at least as big as health care premiums today. But without the same high quality care, ready access to treatment, innovation in new technologies, and research into new medicines. In addition, the government will decide who receives what treatment and how much so if you get on the wrong side of bureaucrats or politicians, watch out. And let\u2019s not forget these increased taxes will now pay the health care costs of illegal immigrants.\n\nEven with all these new taxes, only about half of the Democrat\u2019s promised plans can be funded. As a result, you can expect a host of new taxes they\u2019re not even talking about yet. For example, the VAT -- a national sales tax on almost everything you buy. Other countries where governments pay for health care charge a VAT in the high teens \u2014 15% or more. And the VAT applies at every stage of production. Building your house out of wood, pay the VAT on lumber. Using nails? Pay the VAT. Carpets, tile, cabinets, appliances? Mark it up 15% or more, all of it. That\u2019ll be the case with everything made from flower pots to automobiles.\n\nThird is regulation.\n\nLike taxes, Obama\u2019s job-killing rules and regulations on job creators wasn\u2019t enough. Today\u2019s Democrats won\u2019t only restore Obama\u2019s regulations in the first 5 minutes they\u2019re in office, they\u2019ll go further. A lot further.\n\nSome want the government to have a say in who sits on corporate boards. No longer will the rule be that corporations must work in the best interests of their stockholders. The new rule will be that every business must do what\u2019s best for \u201cstakeholders\u201d including customers, regulators, vendors, employees, and people who live nearby.\n\nThis means as well that finance advisors, bankers, and stockbrokers would no longer be required to put their customers first; but all the other \u201cstakeholders\u201d around them.\n\nDemocrats are talking about breaking up large corporations with zero attention given to the value of their stock. They\u2019ll hurt IRA\u2019s, 401(k)s, pensions, and everything else.\n\nUnion controlled Democrats will also mandate that all road, infrastructure, and construction projects be staffed solely with union labor \u2014 raising costs and reducing efficiency.\n\nBut it won\u2019t just be construction, unions will get greater control over education as well with fewer charter schools and fewer choices for families. Government bureaucracies will also grow as public employee unions gain power and influence.\n\nThe net impact of all these new costs, taxes, and regulations will be the tanking of our once vibrant economy. More welfare, higher unemployment, rising inflation, less money in your pocket, and a lack of control over your own future.\n\nIf you think the government can run your life better than you, then you haven\u2019t been paying attention and so you might be right. But if you know better, then don\u2019t let it happen.", "description": "First is reparations.Democrats started the conversation about reparations totally ignoring .10/09/2019 14:32:20PM EST.", "authors": ["John Philip Sousa Iv", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
