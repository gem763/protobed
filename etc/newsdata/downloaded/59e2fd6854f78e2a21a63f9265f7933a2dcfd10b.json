Rugby World Cup 2019 A Wales supporters laughs outside the City of Toyota Stadium AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play particularly well but we didn\u2019t feel we got a lot of the rub of the green from Angus either.\n\n\u201cI think if you look back at the scrum, we actually went straight through the middle of the Welsh scrum to get a turnover ball very early in the game.\n\n\u201cAnd then when they ran around the corner we got no receipt (of penalties) from that and they were given penalty rewards, which was incredibly frustrating.\u201d\n\nSchmidt rarely offers candid views on referees other than to stress Ireland\u2019s hard graft to concede as few penalties as possible, which all feeds into his intense demands for accuracy from his players.\n\nIreland fell foul of the penalty count in Saturday\u2019s comprehensive 27-3 win over Scotland in the Pool A opener in Yokohama, where Wayne Barnes took the whistle.\n\nSchmidt has lamented what he considers heavy punishment in that contest too, especially given his side\u2019s near total control of proceedings.\n\nWorld Rugby this week issued a stinging statement hitting out at the standard of World Cup refereeing, with the officials having failed to issue the correct punishments for a string of big incidents.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Reece Hodge has since been handed a three-week ban after a disciplinary hearing for a head-high shot on Peceli Yato, that tackle leaving the Fiji star concussed and out of the match.\n\nSamoa centre Rey Lee-Lo and hooker Motu Matu\u2019u face disciplinary hearings too for high shots that only yielded yellow cards in their win over Russia.\n\nIn the wake of the World Rugby statement, however, Schmidt now expects all the officials to raise their game.\n\nAdd the context of him raising previous frustrations with Saturday\u2019s referee Gardner and this is Schmidt leaving the Australian official on notice that his performance this weekend will be under greater scrutiny than perhaps ever before.\n\nAsked if Sunday\u2019s penalty count against Scotland proved a consternation, Schmidt said: \u201cYes, it was annoying and surprising considering that a lot of what we did we felt we were kind of on top in that game.\n\n\u201cI think that the officials are going to be as nailed on as they possibly can be and Angus is no different from any other official this weekend.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be looking to be as accurate as they possibly can be, and I think that\u2019s the whole team of four.\n\n\u201cWe saw a couple of citings from the game in our pool on Tuesday evening where the officials as a team decided they were yellow cards and then they were cited later as red cards. So nobody is really operating in isolation now.\n\n\u201cThe referee is very much reliant on his assistant referees and his Television Match Officials (TMOs) to be a team of four.\n\n\u201cAnd so I think Angus will be leading that team but it will certainly be a team effort from the officials.\n\n\u201cObviously they\u2019ve been given a stir up from World Rugby and I know when these players that I work with get a stir up, they come out and they\u2019re very focused the next outing.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019d have confidence that the officials are going to be good this weekend across the board.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Joe Schmidt has heaped the pressure on referee Angus Gardner ahead of Ireland\u2018s World Cup\u00a0clash with hosts Japan\u00a0on Saturday.
