But as is often the case when Congress attempts to look tough on Big Tech, the hearing rapidly devolved into unrelated partisan grandstanding and an embarrassing lack of technical understanding.\n\nRepublicans brought up Section 230 and Twitter\u2019s decision to briefly lock Mitch McConnell\u2019s account; U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell, a Washington state Democrat, insisted a Facebook exec tell her how 8chan \u2014 the extremist imageboard she repeatedly and erroneously referred to as a \u201cdarkweb\u201d site \u2014 ought to be legislated, for reasons unknown.\n\nIn short: a total embarrassment of a hearing that touched little on the actual issues of radicalisation online and the real-world violence it can foster.\n\nPartly to blame though was the existence of the hearing itself. While there are undeniable pockets of violent shitheels all over the web, and companies more interested in profit than user safety often do little to police them, is the premise that platform inaction is the foremost cause of mass shootings a valid one?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna say that there\u2019s no connection, but every other country on the planet has social media, video games, online harassment, hate groups, crime and mental health issues. But they don\u2019t have mass shootings like we do,\u201d U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth said this morning. \u201cNothing highlights the absurdity of Congress\u2019s inability to solve the gun violence crisis like seeing 318 mass shootings in 260 days and then holding a hearing on extremism in social media.\u201d\n\nAnd she\u2019s quite right. Accompanying her comments were three charts, blown up and printed on posterboard, showing:\n\nAmericans do not spend an exceptional amount of time on social media Americans do spend a comparatively greater amount of time playing video games, but that... Neither of those numbers are remotely proportionate with the number of gun deaths \u2014 a figure which tracks most closely with (and now might be a good time to feign shock if you\u2019ve looked at the news at any point since Columbine) the number of guns people own in the U.S.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019re reminded daily, the world is full of individuals who use social media platforms to disparage others, cast false equivalencies, and question facts [...] The internet has emboldened and empowered hate by allowing individuals to develop online communities and share their warped ideas \u2014 but it is our weak gun laws here in the U.S. that allows that hate to become lethal,\u201d said Duckworth, a veteran whose time served in combat overseas left her with considerable experience with guns and resulted in the loss of her legs.\n\n\u201cThe Dayton shooter had a 100-round drum. I didn\u2019t have a 100-round drum when I served in Iraq! We didn\u2019t send Marines into Fallujah with 100-round drums,\u201d she added.\n\nAs George Selim, senior vice president of programs at the Anti-Defamation League, who also testified this morning, pointed out repeatedly that \u201c73 per cent of extremist-related murders and homicides were in fact committed with firearms.\u201d\n\nLoathe as I am to let Twitter, Facebook, or Google off easy for any reason \u2014 all have done plenty to make the world a dumber, angrier, more needlessly surveilled place \u2014 but Duckworth is right: Better machine learning tools to flag ISIS videos and more moderators to police incel forums isn\u2019t going to stop radicalised pieces of shit from putting bullets into strangers if the bullets are easy to come by.\n\nThe only question Duckworth asked of the companies\u2019 representatives was if they were aware of \u201cspecific trends\u201d that would explain the amount of gun violence here. None said they were because the obvious unifying quality of mass shootings isn\u2019t Facebook, it\u2019s the presence of and easy access to firearms.", "description": "Ostensibly, Thursday's U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing was intended to be an assessment of what social media platforms are doing, and what they ought to be doing better, as mass shootings and the monsters who commit them continue to rain tragedy on communities around the world....", "authors": ["Sam Rutherford", "Ryan F.
