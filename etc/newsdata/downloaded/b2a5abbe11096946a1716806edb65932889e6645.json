In a letter to House Democrat leaders last week, the White House said it would not cooperate with the impeachment investigation. The White House has deemed the probe\u2019s process \u201cillegitimate.\u201d In the letter, the White House all but dared House Democrats to vote to authorize the investigation.\n\nEsper and the other officials echoed the White House\u2019s position in their own letters. They wrote to House Democrats that they were not honoring the subpoena\u2019s deadline because the probe is illegitimate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Reuters reported:\n\nIn a letter seen by Reuters, the Pentagon said the House of Representatives did not have a resolution authorizing an impeachment investigation, adding that it could not produce documents in the eight days it was given to comply with the subpoena.\n\nThe letter reportedly declared:\n\nThe Department is unable to comply with your request for documents at this time. Nevertheless, the Department respects the oversight role of the appropriate committees of Congress, and stands ready to work with your committees should there be an appropriate resolution of this matter.\n\nOver the weekend, Esper said he would cooperate with his subpoena. The Pentagon chief, however, did not explicitly commit to honoring Tuesday\u2019s deadline to provide documents.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the status of what that document preparation is, what restrictions we may have internally with regard to releasing them, the White House has a say on the release of documents as well,\u201d he told Fox News Sunday\u2018s Chris Wallace.\n\nHouse Democrats warned Esper against not complying with the subpoena in the October 7 letter requesting the documents.\n\nConsistent with warnings for other Trump administration officials, the Democrats cautioned Esper:\n\nFailure or refusal to comply with the subpoena, including at the direction or behest of the President or the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the President.\n\nThe Democrat-led Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are conducting the impeachment probe.\n\nA \u201cwhistleblower\u201d allegation that Trump attempted to coerce Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, is at the center of the investigation.", "description": "Mike Esper joins other Trump administration officials bucking Tuesday\u2019s subpoena deadline for documents requested by House Democrats.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1170757294-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
