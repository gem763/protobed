A few days ago, Axios crowed that \u201cnot a single mile has been built where no barrier existed before.\u201d Last week the WaPo declared that \u201cTrump\u2019s border wall is now a monument to his failure.\u201d So I guess that about wraps it up, eh? No wall for you, Mr. President.\n\nExcept that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. In fact, construction is gearing up in multiple locations already. More on this from the Associated Press.\n\nSouth of Yuma, Arizona, the tall brown bollards rising against a cloudless desert sky will replace much shorter barriers that are meant to keep out cars, but not people. This 5-mile (8-kilometer) section of fencing is where President Donald Trump\u2019s most salient campaign promise \u2014 to build a wall along the entire southern border \u2014 is taking shape. The president and his administration said this week that they plan on building between 450 and 500 miles (724 and 806 kilometers) of fencing along the nearly 2,000-mile (3,218-kilometer) border by the end of 2020, an ambitious undertaking funded by billions of defense dollars that had been earmarked for things like military base schools, target ranges and maintenance facilities.\n\nI agree with the AP report saying that 450 to 500 miles of the border wall by next year is \u201cambitious\u201d (to say the least), but it\u2019s not impossible. And as long as the new construction is focused on the areas where the most illegal traffic is crossing the border, it will make a significant difference. (We\u2019re already seeing measurable decreases in crossings thanks to help from Mexico, but we still need a significant barrier to really drive those numbers down.)\n\nThe trick that\u2019s being used by Axios, the Washington Post, and others to claim that there\u2019s no \u201cnew wall\u201d being built is that they add on a caveat in the fine print. They specify \u201cwhere no previous barrier existed before.\u201d But that\u2019s a distinction without any real meaning. Take the stretch of bollard barrier going up in Yuma for example. Yes, there was technically a \u201cbarrier\u201d there before, but it was a barrier to stop vehicles from driving over You can walk right through there with little more than a hop. A child could do it.\n\nWhat it\u2019s being replaced with is a series of 30-foot tall steel bollards. And it\u2019s not just a wall, by the way. As the Washington Examiner reported earlier this week, it\u2019s actually a \u201cborder system.\u201d It includes improved lighting and electronic surveillance to detect attempted crossings, allowing law enforcement to be quickly dispatched to the scene. Yes, it\u2019s taken a while to pull this all together and the Democrats\u2019 stonewalling on funding certainly didn\u2019t help, but it looks like we\u2019re finally making progress.\n\nWhat continues to amaze me is the desperation among Democrats and their media allies to prevent this from happening. Either you believe that we have immigration laws for a reason or you don\u2019t. And if they really don\u2019t support open borders (as many of them try to claim), why would you object to a wall, fence or barrier that helps control the flow of people?\n\nThe answer? Because it was the Bad Orange Man\u2019s idea. That\u2019s why.", "description": "Bring in the trucks, boys", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/border-wall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
