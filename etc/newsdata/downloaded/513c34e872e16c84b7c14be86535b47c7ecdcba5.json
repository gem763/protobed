Focus on the Family has been accused of being anti-gay and for promoting \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d a practice used to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation.\n\nNFL\u2019S DREW BREES, FOCUS ON THE FAMILY RESPOND AFTER BIBLE VIDEO DRAWS CRITICS\n\nWatson appeared on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d and revealed how he reacted to the controversy.\n\n\u201cMy reaction was, first, the article itself was misleading and a mischaracterization of Focus on the Family and of Drew,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThey were slanderous. And so my response was to stop lying with those sorts of labels.\u201d\n\nWatson, who played with Brees for four seasons, also took issue with characterizing Focus on the Family as anti-gay and discriminatory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame in this country right now if you adhere to certain biblical beliefs, that we all have a right to choose what religions were adhere to, you\u2019re labeled as \u2018anti,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhat Focus on the Family does is upholds marriage, which family is the basic building block of society. They uphold those things and they\u2019re labeled anti by other people. And there\u2019s an agenda there and that\u2019s what really upset me about the whole thing.\u201d\n\nNEW YORK GIANTS HERO LAWRENCE TYNES TROLLS BAKER MAYFIELD AFTER CLEVELAND BROWNS' BLOWOUT LOSS\n\nBrees responded to critics last week over the issue.\n\n\u201cHopefully this sets the record straight with who I am and what I stand for,\u201d Brees tweeted along with a video. \u201cLove, Respect, and Accept ALL. I encourage you not to believe the negativity you read that says differently. It\u2019s simply not true. Have a great day.\u201d\n\nIn the video, Brees says: \u201cI do not support any groups that discriminate or that have their own agendas that are trying to promote inequality.\u201d\n\nBrees then spoke with reporters in an attempt to further clarify where he stands.\n\nHe said he believes he was unfairly and mistakenly accused of being anti-gay, and that he participated in the video solely to promote Bring Your Bible to School Day, not to endorse \u201cany type of hate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that there are, unfortunately, Christian organizations out there that are involved in that kind of thing,\u201d he said, according to ESPN. \u201cAnd to me, that is totally against what being a Christian is all about. Being a Christian is love, it\u2019s forgiveness, it\u2019s respecting all, it\u2019s accepting all.\u201d\n\nIn a video posted on YouTube, Focus on the Family's Jim Daly also clarified that the Colorado-based organization is not a hate group.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cOur goal is to say, \u2018Jesus loves you, cares about you, no matter who you are \u2014 your race, your creed, your sexual orientation. Jesus died for every one of us.\u2019 That's the message we want to get out,\" Daly said.\n\nFox News\u2019 Dom Calicchio contributed to this report.", "description": "Veteran NFL tight end Benjamin Watson said Monday the backlash his former teammate Drew Brees received for his involvement with a Christian group was unfair.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
