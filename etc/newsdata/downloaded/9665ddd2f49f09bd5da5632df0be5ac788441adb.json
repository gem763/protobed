Our dominant political narrative is like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book for morons, offering only a conservative red storyline or a liberal blue storyline, with nothing in between or outside those primary color bounds. Politicians themselves, out of self-interest, adhere to this narrative, which makes the political press adhere to the narrative, and before you know it you have an entire country that thinks about the ethical complexities of political economy with all the nuance of a Florida Gators fan hollering about why the Georgia Bulldogs are bad.\n\nRefuse, block, stonewall \u2013 but Trump's strategy leaves little margin for error Read more\n\nWe are presented with politics as sports, even though sports are a terrible model for politics. A population that chooses a political party and sticks to it out of team loyalty is a good thing for political power brokers, but a bad thing for the population of people. Every hypocritical, lying, self-serving greedhead who uses politics for the most cynical possible purposes leans on the fact that, as long as they are wearing their team colors, voters will forgive them for anything. The decrepit, oligarchal state of democracy can be attributed in part to the fact that \u2013 as any sleight-of-hand magician can tell you \u2013 it is easy to pick people\u2019s pockets when they are so easily distracted by shiny symbols. Sometimes the symbol is a Bible, or an American flag, or a shotgun and orange vest wielded by a congressman to show you that despite the fact that he went to Yale and spent his career as an oil and gas lobbyist, he shares your affinity for duck hunting. And sometimes, the distracting symbol that makes you dumb is the blue flag of the Democratic party.\n\nThe son of a longtime US senator gets his start as a lawyer with one of the biggest corporate donors to his dad\u2019s campaigns; a friend of his dad\u2019s gets him a job in the Clinton administration, and then as a lobbyist; later, while his father is vice president, he is given a $50,000 per month seat on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm, despite lacking any clear energy expertise. How does this all happen? It happened the same way that Chelsea Clinton became a \u201cspecial correspondent\u201d for NBC News, and Jenna Bush got a job as a Today show host, and the Trump children got jobs overseeing a real estate empire. It happened the same way, for that matter, that George W Bush \u2013 objectively, a flailing dumbass \u2013 became the governor of Texas and then the president of the United States.\n\nWhen you are the son of a famous and powerful politician, you are showered with opportunity, whether you deserve it or not. This is nepotism, but it is also, if we are being direct, a form of corruption. Moral corruption. Not only because these prestigious positions are not earned, and because these celebukids are taking something that rightly should have gone to someone more deserving; but also because, even though there is rarely anything so crude as a direct quid pro quo, this undeserved largesse is always motivated to some extent by a desire by some powerful interest to take advantage of the halo of influence cast by the parents. That influence should properly accrue to the public, who their parents work for. The lavish lives afforded to famous kids are, in effect, stolen from the American people. Each coveted job handed to a president\u2019s kid represents a small quantity of subversion of the spirit of the democratic process.\n\nTrump is the kid caught in the cookie jar \u2013 and Republicans know it | Robert Reich Read more\n\nThis particular form of injustice is often waved off as just be the way of the world. Seven-foot-tall people get to be in the NBA, and the children of presidents and vice-presidents get sweet, lucrative gigs whether they\u2019re qualified for them or not. We shouldn\u2019t take this so lightly. We should, in fact, be enraged by it. Politics is not just another way to get rich. It is a public service field, and the more important the position, the more stringent the ethical requirements it should carry.\n\nThe next three generations of a president\u2019s family should have to work the checkout line at Family Dollar. What better way to stay in touch with the pulse of America? What better way to demonstrate how much they value hard work, and the gargantuan struggle to join the middle class? This simple rule would prevent political dynasties, which are always and everywhere antithetical to a well functioning democracy. We don\u2019t need more Bushes in the White House, nor more Kennedys in Congress, nor more of the few good media jobs taken up by people who attended Sidwell Friends school while escorted by armed guards. An absurd share of life\u2019s rewards are not a birthright for the spawn of public servants. Give the rest of the world a chance, you greedy little cloistered aristocrats.\n\nHunter Biden and his unearned riches are a moral failure. The same moral failure infects Democrats and Republicans alike. (This is a simple demonstration of the fact that \u201cclass war\u201d is a much more accurate lens on politics than \u201cred versus blue\u201d.) Yes, the Republican party exists to perpetuate rather than destroy this inequality-generating system, and yes, the Trump family has taken nepotism, corruption, and cartoonish greed to previously unseen levels. These are reasons for Democrats not to do the same things. I don\u2019t want to hear Democrats \u2013 members of the party that ostensibly stands for more equality and purer democracy \u2013 pretending that the fact that the VP\u2019s son got a do-nothing $600k per year corporate handout is unremarkable. I want Democrats to demonstrate that we live our values. I want Democrats to send their kids to public school, unionize their workplaces and give money to the poor.\n\nSend Hunter Biden and his peers right down to Family Dollar with name tags and a training manual. Lead by example. If the Trump kids refuse to join them, don\u2019t worry \u2013 we\u2019ll have the moral high ground. Surely that\u2019s what matters to \u201cMiddle Class Joe.\u201d", "description": "I don\u2019t want to hear Democrats pretending that the fact that Biden\u2019s son got a do-nothing $600k per year corporate handout is unremarkable.
