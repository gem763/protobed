That was a reference to a scandal that resulted from her deleting tens of thousands of messages from a private server that contained all her email correspondence during her time as secretary of state.\n\nThe messages that remained contained at least 100 classified pieces of information.\n\nClinton also ran in 2008 and lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama. She said in March that she's 'not running' this time but planned to 'keep working and speaking and standing up for what I believe.'\n\nShe has kept her name in the news during a book tour with her daughter Chelsea by declaring that Trump is an 'illegitimate president.'\n\nOn Tuesday he tweeted: 'I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren,' Trump tweeted Tuesday.\n\n'Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u201cC\u201d Subpoena!' he added, with a 'C' for Congress.\n\nTrump's tweet daring Clinton to run next year came with a video clip from a debate moment exactly 3 years ago in which he said Hillary would 'be in jail' if he were president\n\nClinton came away from the October 9, 2016 ndebate in St. Louis thinking she would be elected president less than a month later\n\nThe president started the squabble about 2020 with a stinging tweet saying she should fully explain her email scandal if she were to run \u2013 and seemingly daring her to try\n\nClinton vented during a PBS NewsHour interview on Tuesday about the issue that spelled her political demise, saying that '[n]othing has been more examined and looked at than my emails, we all know that. So, he\u2019s either lying or delusional, or both.'\n\n'There was no subpoena as he says in a tweet this morning, so, maybe there does need to be a rematch,' she continued.\n\nAnd then in a stunning declaration, she deadpanned: 'I mean, obviously, I can beat him again.'\n\nDemocrats often publicly devalue Trump's decisive 2016 victory by pointing out that Clinton won more votes overall, nationally.\n\nAmerican presidents are elected through the Electoral College, however, which awards no advantage for what political analysts call 'running up the score' in heavily partisan states.\n\nClinton's ultimately meaningless margins of victory in California and New York, together, were larger than her advantage nationwide.\n\nClinton told a PBS interviewer on Tuesday that she could beat Donald Trump 'again,' glossing over the reality of her decisive loss in the all-important Electoral College\n\nIn the wake of her politically devastating email scandal, Clinton received a slap on the wrist for running afoul of federal record-keeping laws. Then-FBI Director James Comey declined to criminally prosecute her.\n\nClinton acknowledged that she and her lawyers held back and discarded 31,830 emails they deemed private and unrelated to her work.\n\nThe FBI determined the emails were destroyed roughly three weeks after Clinton received a congressional subpoena ordering her to to turn them over.\n\nThe Democrat is a recurring character in Trump's rally speeches, often drawing chants of 'Lock her up! Lock her up!' \u2013 but far less in the past year than during the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe president has two rallies this week, in Minnesota and Louisiana, and one nest week in Texas.", "description": "The president trolled her on Wednesday, reposting a video clip from their debate three years ago\u00a0- to the day\u00a0- in which he quipped that if he were president she would be behind bars.", "authors": ["David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/18/19503144-0-image-a-25_1570642064197.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
