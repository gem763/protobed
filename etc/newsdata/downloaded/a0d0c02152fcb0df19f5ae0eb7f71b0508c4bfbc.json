But the more clues archaeologists uncover from the European past, the more they understand how dramatically these same influences have been shaping fish populations for hundreds of years.\n\nRichard Hoffmann, an environmental historian, has been studying the complex interplay between humans and the aquatic environment for most of his career. He\u2019s read a medico-dietary analysis of the Catholic saint Hildegard that names 37 fish taxa; he\u2019s found tax records for the price of fish; and he\u2019s reviewed zooarchaeological analyses on the rise and fall of fish populations across Europe. All these details help him reconstruct which fish were on the menu for different social classes, how big those fish grew, and when they disappeared.\n\nAsking those questions often means confronting myths. \u201cSome people think everyone in the past was rapacious,\u201d Hoffmann says. \u201cYou also get the opposite myths of hyper-abundance.\u201d One false tale that originated in the 17th century alleged that salmon and sturgeon were so abundant during the Middle Ages that servants had contracts stipulating they wouldn\u2019t be served those fish more than a few times a week.\n\nThe reality is more complicated. In Europe, aquatic animals have been traded at least since the days of the Roman Empire. But it was during the early Middle Ages, with the arrival of widespread Christianity, that the animals became a popular source of protein. That\u2019s partially due to the roughly 130 days a year when the faithful were exhorted not to eat meat, because fish didn\u2019t count in that category.\n\nAt the same time, expanding agrarian populations were cutting down forests to create fields and diverting rivers to fill defensive moats around castles and towns, Hoffmann writes in one paper. From the ninth century A.D. to the 11th, the number of grain mills built along rivers in England exploded from about 200 to 5,624. Species that came into fresh water to spawn, such as salmon and sturgeon, began declining. New regulations, such as King Philip\u2019s, were put into place to manage fish populations. A Scottish statute from 1214 required all dams to include an opening for fish and barrier nets to be lifted every Saturday, for instance. Soon highly sophisticated aquaculture ponds stocked with carp also provided regular access to fish for the landed elite.\n\nThis decline in freshwater populations coincided with a sudden, commercial-scale boom in sea fishing, which began around A.D. 1000 and is known as the \u201cfish event horizon.\u201d In one study, archaeologists collected cod bones in London from 95 Roman, medieval, and postmedieval sites. The number of bones jumped circa the year 1000, and isotopic sampling showed that in the following centuries, fish came from farther and farther away, indicating long-distance trade. In the southern English town of Southampton, the remains of marine species (such as cod) began to outnumber freshwater species (such as eel) by 1030.", "description": "More than 700 years ago, demand for sturgeon, salmon, and other fish was so high that kings had to start regulating fishing.", "authors": ["Lorraine Boissoneault"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/05/GettyImages_173305143/facebook.jpg?1558371215", "published_at": "2019-05-21"}
