One increasingly popular view is that they will find themselves low on ammunition. Budget deficits and public debts are already high around the world, and monetary policy is reaching its limits. Japan, the eurozone, and a few other smaller advanced economies already have negative policy rates, and are still conducting quantitative and credit easing. Even the Fed is cutting rates and implementing a backdoor QE program, through its backstopping of repo (short-term borrowing) markets.\n\nBut it is naive to think that policymakers would simply allow a wave of \u201ccreative destruction\u201d that liquidates every zombie firm, bank, and sovereign entity. They will be under intense political pressure to prevent a full-scale depression and the onset of deflation. If anything, then, another downturn will invite even more \u201ccrazy\u201d and unconventional policies than what we\u2019ve seen thus far.\n\nConverging views\n\nIn fact, views from across the ideological spectrum are converging on the notion that a semi-permanent monetisation of larger fiscal deficits will be unavoidable \u2013 and even desirable \u2013 in the next downturn. Left-wing proponents of so-called Modern Monetary Theory say larger permanent fiscal deficits are sustainable when monetised during periods of economic slack, because there is no risk of runaway inflation.\n\nFollowing this logic, in the UK, the Labour Party has proposed a \u201cPeople\u2019s QE\u201d, whereby the central bank would print money to finance direct fiscal transfers to households, rather than to bankers and investors. Others, including mainstream economists such as former UK Financial Services Authority chairman Adair Turner, have called for \u201chelicopter drops\u201d: direct cash transfers to consumers through central bank-financed fiscal deficits. Still others, such as former Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer and his colleagues at BlackRock, have proposed a \u201cstanding emergency fiscal facility\u201d, which would allow the central bank to finance large fiscal deficits in the event of a deep recession.\n\nDespite differences in terminology, all of these proposals are variants of the same idea: large fiscal deficits monetised by central banks should be used to stimulate aggregate demand in the event of the next slump. To understand what this future might look like, we need only look to Japan, where the central bank is effectively financing the country\u2019s large fiscal deficits and monetising its high ratio of debt to GDP by maintaining a negative policy rate, conducing large-scale QE, and pursuing a 10-year government bond yield target of zero per cent.\n\nRisk of trade decoupling\n\nWill such policies actually be effective in stopping and reversing the next slump? In the case of the 2008 financial crisis, which was triggered by a negative aggregate demand shock and a credit crunch on illiquid but solvent agents, massive monetary and fiscal stimulus and private-sector bailouts made sense. But what if the next recession is triggered by a permanent negative supply shock that produces stagflation (slower growth and rising inflation)? That, after all, is the risk posed by a decoupling of US-China trade, Brexit, or persistent upward pressure on oil prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFiscal and monetary loosening is not an appropriate response to a permanent supply shock. Policy easing in response to the oil shocks of the 1970s resulted in double-digit inflation and a sharp, risky increase in public debt. Moreover, if a downturn renders some corporations, banks, or sovereign entities insolvent \u2013 not just illiquid \u2013 it makes no sense to keep them alive. In these cases, a bail-in of creditors (debt restructuring and write-offs) is more appropriate than a \u201czombifying\u201d bailout.\n\nIn short, a semi-permanent monetisation of fiscal deficits in the event of another downturn may or may not be the appropriate policy response. It all depends on the nature of the shock. But, because policymakers will be pressured to do something, \u201ccrazy\u201d policy responses will become a foregone conclusion. The question is whether they will do more harm than good over the long term.\n\nProject Syndicate.", "description": "Policymakers are sure to hit the QE button to avoid a recession.
