However, there are people who cannot think of celebrating the festival of lights. The people in question are the helpless PMC bank depositors who continue to protest for their own hard-earned money.\n\nMost of the PMC Bank account holders are Sikhs and they are facing a major cash crunch as the RBI has imposed restrictions on the withdrawal of cash from the bank. What further adds to their woes is the fact that they won't also be able to celebrate the festival of light -- Diwali -- with the usual enthusiasm.\n\n\"The PMC Bank is not cooperating with us. Guru Purb is around. We had planned so many things for that occasion but now we would not be able to celebrate our festival with the same amount of happiness,\" said an account holder of the PMC Bank.\n\n\"On this Diwali, PMC Bank holders won't even celebrate the festival with joy and happiness. People had saved money for weddings and festivals. Their money has now been blocked by the bank completely,\" he added.\n\nDon't Miss 385 SHARES 374 SHARES\n\nBCCL\n\nThe Sikh account holders have urged that a bailout plan should be out as early as possible as the 550th birth anniversary celebrations are a big thing for the community and not being able to celebrate it properly will be a big disappointment for them.\n\nREUTERS\n\nRaghuvir Singh, another PMC Bank account holder, told news agency ANI, \"I have an account in this bank for the last 16 years. Sikhs and their various organisations have accounts in the PMC Bank for years.
