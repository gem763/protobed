The Russian-Turkish pact gives the Kurds roughly six days to evacuate virtually the entire strip along the Turkish border.\n\nThe political fallout from Mr. Trump\u2019s decision continued to be felt in Washington as the State Department\u2019s point man on the Syria crisis told a Senate panel Tuesday that he was not consulted prior to the announcement to U.S. forces were pulling back. The U.N. said Tuesday the Turkish incursion so far has damaged \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d in the area and displaced more than 176,000 people, including nearly 80,000 children.\n\nIn a sign of the bipartisan opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s move, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced legislation Tuesday denouncing Turkey\u2019s invasion of northern Syria and urging Mr. Trump to halt his withdrawal of U.S. troops.\n\nVeteran diplomat Ambassador James Jeffrey acknowledged to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he \u201cwas not personally consulted before\u201d the Pentagon was ordered to move forces out of the region, clearing the path for a Turkish military offensive in northeast Syria in a region that is heavily populated by American-backed Kurds.\n\nMr. Jeffrey told lawmakers the government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u201cacted unwisely and dangerously\u201d by launching its offensive in the zone, \u201cdespite warning after warning and incentive after incentive\u201d from the Trump administration.\n\nThe deal between Mr. Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin was announced following a six-hour meeting after which they laid out a 10-point plan to patrol the zone. Mr. Erdogan said the agreement \u201cwill start a new era toward Syria\u2019s lasting stability and it being cleared of terrorism.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said the pact solidifies Moscow\u2019s influence in the region following President Trump\u2019s surprise announcement to withdraw U.S. forces earlier this month.\n\nMr. Trump has slightly modified his original withdrawal plan, with the Pentagon saying a deployment of around 200 special operations forces may stay in eastern Syria to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State and safeguard valuable Syrian oil fields. But U.S. plans to relocated American troops from Syria to neighboring Iraq met resistance from Baghdad, where officials say the new troops have not been given permission to stay.\n\nU.S. troops \u2014 who for five years fought alongside Kurdish forces in the fight to defeat the Islamic State caliphate \u2014 were pelted with potatoes that hit the sides of American armored vehicles as they departed a town in northeast Syria as part of the withdrawal. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told CNN Tuesday the relocated U.S. forces would only be in Iraq temporarily before being sent home at a later date.\n\nDespite the lack of prior notice, Mr. Jeffrey defended the administration\u2019s move in the face of stinging criticism from senators of both parties Tuesday, saying the U.S. is pressing from a\u201dmore permanent cease-fire,\u201d but that a deal has yet to be struck between the U.S., Turkey, and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican and a sharp critic of the Syria withdrawal and the abandonment of the Kurds, said he had spoken with Mr. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about a permanent cease-fire that also has yet to be announced. The South Carolina Republican told The Washington Times that he plans to speak with the president about a deal that could involve a buffer zone patrolled by global allies. But the international partners in this effort remain unknown.\n\nInternational Crisis Group President Robert Malley, the special envoy to Syria under President Obama, said \u201cif the Kurds are prepared to withdraw from this area \u2014 which they haven\u2019t been in the past \u2014 there are some European countries that are now saying they are now prepared to contemplate it, Germany in particular.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Malley, who now serves as the president of the ICG, noted there was a \u201cvast discrepancy\u201d in the specific zone that would be patrolled. \u201cThe devil\u2019s in the details,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparately, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told reporters in Sochi that about 500 suspected Islamic State and jihadists militants have fled captivity from northeastern Syria since the start of fighting. Syrian Kurdish forces had been detaining thousands of Islamic State group fighters in camps in the area.\n\n\u2981 This story is based in part on wire reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
