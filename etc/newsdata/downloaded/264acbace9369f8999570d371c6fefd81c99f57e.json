Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Tuesday that the world is \u201cin uproar and shocked.\u201d He also accused the Trump administration of conducting trade policy based on lies.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Navarro\u2019s offense may not be as bad as you think it is.\n\nThe story was first broken last week by the Chronicle of Higher Education, which noted that Navarro wrote about Vara and quoted him in a number of nonfiction books, but that there is no record of him existing. Navarro copped to the invention, calling Ron Vara \u2014 an anagram of \u201cNavarro\u201d \u2014 \u201ca whimsical device and pen name I\u2019ve used throughout the years for opinions and purely entertainment value, not as a source of fact.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOthers have picked up on the story, including the New York Times, NPR, CNN and outlets in Australia, where Navarro\u2019s use of \u201cRon Vara\u201d was first discovered.\n\nBut almost every story written about this omits a key fact: When Navarro first introduced Vara in his 2001 book, \u201cIf It\u2019s Raining in Brazil, Buy Starbucks,\u201d he didn\u2019t present him as a real person. He was one of the number of transparently fictional characters Navarro used to make his points.\n\n\u201cLet me show you what I mean with just a few examples of some fictional microinvestors in very real situations,\u201d Navarro wrote in his introduction.\n\nIn chapter 5, Navarro introduces \u201cRobert Fisher,\u201d whom he later reemphasizes is a \u201cfictional chess player cum stock trader.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn chapter 8, he references \u201cour fictional trader named Hope Knot.\u201d\n\nIn chapter 9, he alludes to \u201cour fictional Julia Edgewater.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn chapter 11, it\u2019s \u201ctwo fictional traders, Charles Yeager and Angela Earhardt.\u201d\n\nIn chapter 18, it\u2019s \u201cour fictional trader leading off this chapter, Richard Hume.\u201d\n\nEach time one of these characters is brought up, Navarro presents their stories in italics \u2014 including, in chapter 19, Ron Vara, \u201cmicrowave trader,\u201d who shorted nuclear stocks two day before the tragedy at Chernobyl.\n\nHere\u2019s what that looks like with Edgewater:\n\nNavarro does not explicitly say that Ron Vara is a fictional character, just as he doesn\u2019t make that disclosure in each and every case. But it should be pretty apparent to anyone reading the book.\n\nAD\n\nIndeed, some of the characters are so ridiculous, there\u2019s no way anyone would think they are real. \u201cHope Knot\u201d is one of them. \u201cRobert Fisher\u201d is a clear play on the actual chess champion, Bobby Fischer. Another is a professor who takes time off to participate in senior cycling competitions in Europe. His name? \u201cLancer Armstrong.\u201d A fourth is a retired economics professor named \u201cHerb Hoover\u201d who just so happened to fall victim to President Herbert Hoover\u2019s interest rate hikes.\n\nAD\n\nNone of this is to say there is nothing wrong with what Navarro did. In later books, he uses cliched anti-China quotes from \u201cRon Vara\u201d to lead off chapters without explaining that \u201cRon Vara\u201d isn\u2019t real. The co-author of his 2010 book \u201cSeeds of Destruction,\u201d Glenn Hubbard, has said he was unaware that Ron Vara was a fictional character.\n\nNavarro also reportedly didn\u2019t tell at least one of his publishers, Prentice Hall, or its parent company, Pearson, which says it will add an advisory note to his 2011 book, \u201cDeath By China,\u201d that discloses Vara is fictional.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPearson has strict editorial standards that apply to all of its publishing businesses and authors,\u201d spokesman Scott Overland told NPR. \u201cWe take any breaches of these standards very seriously and take swift action when one is identified.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt worst, Navarro seems to have taken a character whom any reader would recognize as fictional and, in future works, expanded his artistic license more than he should have. But it shouldn\u2019t be ignored that he was pretty transparent about what he was doing when he presented Ron Vara for the first time \u2014 the only time, it bears noting, that he appears to have dwelt upon Ron Vara\u2019s backstory.\n\nAnd that should probably temper any \u201cuproar\u201d or \u201cshock\u201d the world is feeling about all this.\n\nAD", "description": "Why Navarro's offense isn't as bad as it might seem.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uppdSc_4J228ECu7zFqPMJMf-So=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QXSCSAXMNII6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
