Presidential Palace/Francesco Ammendola/Handout via REUTERS\n\nConte has held a round of talks with both 5-Star and PD leaders looking to stitch together a new administration after his previous government collapsed when the far-right League pulled out in an effort to trigger early elections.\n\nMembers of 5-Star will hold a ballot on the party\u2019s internet platform from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (0700 GMT to 1600 GMT) on Tuesday to decide whether the group should join forces with the PD, its traditional foe.\n\nWith the outcome uncertain, Conte posted a video on Facebook saying the proposed coalition would be good for Italy.\n\n\u201cI understand your doubts, but there is a unique opportunity to show we can really decisively reform this country and do extraordinary things,\u201d said Conte, a law professor who has no political affiliation but is seen as close to 5-Star.\n\n\u201cTo do this we don\u2019t need superheroes that my son likes so much. It\u2019s sufficient to have people who are normal but responsible and determined, who love their country more than anything else.\u201d\n\nShortly after he spoke, 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio also took to Facebook, but he delivered a more subdued message and refused to advise his party members on how to vote.\n\n\u201cThere is no right or wrong vote, there are your ideas and the sum of your ideas will guide the movement,\u201d Di Maio said. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid ... we have already won, the world is waiting for the democratic outcome of your vote to know Italy\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nAn SWG opinion poll for La7 television channel said 51% of 5-Star supporters backed a tie-up with the PD, while some 69% of PD voters endorsed the idea.\n\nItalian bond yields fell toward multi-year lows on Monday in a sign that investors believed a new government would take office, heading off the risk of an early election and prolonged political instability in the euro zone\u2019s third largest economy.\n\nAmongst the various things Conte said he thought his new cabinet could work on were a reduction in taxes, a new focus on sustainable development, a crackdown on tax evasion, a reform of the justice system and the introduction of a minimum wage.\n\nHe also pledged to avert a hike in VAT sales taxes that is due to kick in automatically from January to keep the public finances of heavily indebted Italy on track.\n\nPD leader Nicola Zingaretti said he was confident a deal would be reached.\n\n\u201cWe are working as you know with patience and in a serious fashion for the formation of a real government of change, because this is what Italy needs to rekindle the economy,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe Italian economy has been broadly stagnant since the second quarter of last year, maintaining its customary position among the most sluggish performers in the 19-nation euro zone.", "description": "Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Monday urged members of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement to back a new coalition with the opposition Democratic Party (PD), saying the planned government could transform Italy.", "authors": ["Crispian Balmer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425527790&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811GF"}
