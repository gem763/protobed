Rob Portman at a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in 2018. (Erin Schaff/Reuters)\n\nSenator Rob Portman on Monday joined a small handful of Senate Republicans to criticize President Trump\u2019s remark that China should investigate Joe Biden over his son\u2019s business dealings.\n\nLast week, Trump accused Hunter Biden on Thursday of flying on Air Force Two in 2013 with his father, then the vice president, in order to obtain $1.5 billion from China for his private equity fund.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe got kicked out of the Navy. All of the sudden he\u2019s getting billions of dollars. You know what they call that? They call that a payoff.\u201d\n\nThe Ohio Republican called Trump\u2019s comments \u201cnot appropriate\u201d but stopped short of calling it \u201can impeachable offense,\u201d saying he does not believe the president\u2019s remark rises to that level.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate for a president to engage a foreign government in an investigation of a political opponent,\u201d Portman said at the Annual Ohio Defense Forum, which is hosted by The Dayton Development Coalition.\n\nThree other Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah, and Ben Sasse of Nebraska have also denounced Trump\u2019s comment.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments came as he was battered with criticism from both sides of the aisle over his July phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump asked Zelensky to help his administration investigate allegations that the former vice president used his position to help Ukrainian natural-gas company Burisma Holdings avoid a corruption probe soon after his son was appointed to its board of directors.\n\n\u201cThe president should not have raised the Biden issue on that call, period,\u201d Portman said.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi last month announced the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry into allegations that President Trump withheld Ukrainian military aid unless Ukraine investigated Biden.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t view it as an impeachable offense,\u201d Portman said. \u201cI think the House frankly rushed to impeachment assuming certain things.\u201d", "description": "Senator Rob Portman on Monday joined a small handful of Senate Republicans to criticize President Trump's remark that China should investigate Joe Biden over his son's business dealings.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Andrew C.
