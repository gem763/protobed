Absolutely fair enough.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, there are altogether too many occasions at which a gift is allegedly required. Birthdays, Christmas, engagements, baby showers, bridal showers, weddings, hen dos, anniversaries, house warmings and miscellaneous other happy times when frankly a hug and a high five should suffice.\n\nNot to mention \u2013 Carrie Bradshaw was entirely correct in that episode where she argued that married people are entitled to too many presents and single people deserve to have expensive high heels bought for them.\n\nWe\u2019ve all gone a little mad on the materialism front and truly, we could be getting away with a sentimental card rather than splurging on a burnt orange Le Creuset pot for someone whose betrothal we don\u2019t even fully condone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s time we did away with the unspoken pressure to validate every occasion with the presentation of a gift and perhaps even limited ourselves to giving presents only when we truly want to.\n\nI will quickly say that giving a gift can be a jolly old feeling, sometimes, and it is a nice thing to do. If you\u2019re into giving gifts, absolutely go for it, my friend.\n\nGetting the perfect present for someone you actually cherish and seeing their face when they open it is a real delight. But on so many other occasions, it\u2019s a straight-up nuisance.\n\nExpensive, superfluous, inconvenient. An affront to your bank account and potentially even your principles. So, let\u2019s trot through some circumstances in which you have my permission not to buy your mate a present.\n\nWhen your presence is present enough\n\nDestination weddings. Your best friend\u2019s birthday dinner at a posh restaurant. Hen dos with multiple locations, activities and outfit changes.\n\nSometimes, your presence at a celebratory occasion ought to be present enough, especially if you\u2019d had to pay for the pleasure of being there.\n\nIt really is your call here but I think we should be quietly rebelling against the social convention that we must lavish everyone in gifts, when attending someone\u2019s event is actually a lovely (and expensive!!) enough gesture as it is.\n\nTruly, if you\u2019ve paid for flights to Ibiza, drinks all night, a spa day and then a Beyonce dance class (for which you also paid in dignity) to congratulate your friend on getting hitched, I don\u2019t believe you owe them an extravagant present.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe a little something, maybe a heartfelt card, maybe a promise to love them forever more, but really they should appreciate your physical presence more than anything.\n\nWe should not feel the need to mark every significant day with a tangible gift; might I suggest simply enjoying each other\u2019s company and perhaps saying a nice thing, instead?\n\nWould the patron saint of giving gifts (I don\u2019t know, Santa Claus) approve this kind of behaviour? (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nWhen you can\u2019t afford it\n\nThere are always pay disparities in friendship groups. If some of you are minted and others less so, then it truly is only fair that people feel comfortable staying within their own budget.\n\nIf you cannot afford to treat your mate on her birthday or wedding or whatever, then simply do not. You might like to explain, if you\u2019re into that sort of transparency, but equally you could just tell them how much they mean to you and make sure they know they matter instead.\n\nYou especially shouldn\u2019t feel as though you must match someone\u2019s own spending habits in the gift you get them.\n\nWhy do rich people always get the most lavish presents? It makes no sense.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly acceptable to give small, affordable gifts \u2013 in fact, they\u2019re often the loveliest because let\u2019s remember, if you\u2019re measuring your friendship in monetary value, you\u2019re doing it all wrong.\n\nWhen in doubt, bake, write something genuine or get a houseplant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you don\u2019t really like the person very much if you\u2019re honest about it\n\nOof, buying a present for someone you don\u2019t even like very much is a total injustice. A small one, in the scheme of things, but an injustice all the same.\n\nPresents should really be gestures of love \u2013 a happy little physical object that signifies how much you like or adore a person. A treat, for both giver and recipient.\n\nIf you stick to that logic, you hereby have permission not to purchase items for people you don\u2019t care for, people you actively dislike and people you have perhaps even chosen as a nemesis.\n\nIf social convention suggests that you should buy a present for someone you don\u2019t like, think to yourself, is this really in the spirit of presents?\n\nWould the patron saint of giving gifts (I don\u2019t know, Santa Claus) approve this kind of behaviour?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. Go on, give yourself a cheeky little policy of only ever buying things for people who make your heart warm. Either that, or get this awful person something objectively terrible, if it\u2019ll make you laugh.\n\nWhen you have taken a no-present pact\n\nDo you know what? If you routinely do not want to give your friends presents and you\u2019d like to feel comfortable with that decision, you could consider setting up a no-present pact among your group.\n\nYou could all pledge to just spend time with each other and shower your birthday, engaged, pregnant friend with compliments and borderline inappropriate affection instead of handing them something wrapped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou could set a monetary limit for birthday presents and just exchange mince pies at Christmas time. You could do a Secret Santa style setup, where you\u2019re all only responsible for one person\u2019s gift.\n\nDo whatever feels right for your friendship group, but a no-present pledge could work. That way, you know what to expect and you can just do away with any guilt or awkwardness altogether.\n\nYou should relax into your anti-present stance. There\u2019s no point being scrupulous about this if you\u2019re arbitrarily going to feel guilt alongside it.\n\nIf you decide not to give gifts to your mates, stand by that choice and simply try to be extra pleasant company instead.\n\nIf we are friends and you\u2019re going to see me on my birthday week, though, I\u2019d like a personalised limerick about how much you love me \u2013 and a cookie.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "So you want to get out of giving your mate a gift, then, huh?
