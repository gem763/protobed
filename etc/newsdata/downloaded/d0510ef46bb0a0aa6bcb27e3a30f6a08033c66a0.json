Before the game we knew all about Everton being tough at home and their position in the table was going to make it doubly difficult.\n\n\u2018I know Aaron Cresswell (left-back) was not 100 per cent able to play but I don\u2019 t must missing one player was a problem.\n\n\u2018We didn\u2019t have a shot in the first half and Everton could have scored more. I chose to take off Felipe Anderson at half-time but if I\u2019d been able to change 11 at that moment, I might have done.\n\nThe Hammers were poor against the Toffees and failed to register a shot in the first half\n\nManuel Pellegrini has stabilised the club after succeeding David Moyes at the London Stadium\n\n\u2018We were a little better in the second half and had some chances but we need to be clear we have to improve to become the same team we were a couple of weeks ago.\u2019\n\n\u00a325million Spaniard Pablo Fornals continued his struggle after a summer move from Villarreal and was taken off after an hour without making an impact.\n\n\u2018It is normal for a player to take some months to adapt to the pace of the Premier League,\u2019 said Pellegrini in his defence.", "description": "After a bright start to the season, West Ham are wobbling after two consecutive losses, and they were flattered by only losing 2-0 at Goodison Park.", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/15/19927672-0-image-a-111_1571497199764.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
