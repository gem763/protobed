Tarbert said:\n\n\u201cFraudulent schemes, like that alleged in this case, not only cheat innocent people out of their hard-earned money, but they threaten to undermine the responsible development of these new and innovative markets. America must be a leader in this space, and we will only succeed if these markets have integrity.\u201d\n\nThe defendants duped at least fourteen people into joining a pool operated by Circle Society, a fraudulent entity created by Saffron, which guaranteed up to 300% returns. Saffron is alleged to have retained the participants\u2019 funds in his own personal cryptocurrency wallet and used them to pay new participants \u201cin the manner of a Ponzi scheme.\u201d\n\nThe CFTC will seek civil monetary penalties, restitution, rescission, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and trading and registration bans, but is aware that there might not be sufficient funds or assets to cover all the losses.\n\nTarbert says Ethereum is a commodity\n\nCointelegraph previously reported that CFTC Chairman Tarbert had said that he believes Ether (ETH) is a commodity and that ETH futures trading is becoming a reality. The CFTC previously stated that Bitcoin is a commodity, but Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, had not been mentioned before.
