Twelve candidates made the debate, and moderators asked them for their thoughts on big tech company monopolies.\n\nThis was the first time the issue of tech monopolies was meaningfully addressed in debates this year. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been running on a platform of breaking up Facebook, Amazon, and Google, which she compares to big oil, and she recently pledged to stop taking donations from tech executives.\n\nBernie Sanders has his own plan that would remove concentrated power from tech companies, but he largely agrees with Warren. Most of the other candidates agree that these companies held too much power and that it was a problem, but they stopped short of proposing specific plans or calling out individual companies and executives. So far, only Sanders and Warren have specific plans detailing how they will handle big tech \u2014 the most common position among candidates is support for regulation and antitrust enforcement, but not necessarily using executive power to break up tech companies.\n\nHere's where each candidate stands on breaking up big tech.", "description": "Warren and Sanders are in favor of breaking up tech monopolies, while other candidates are more concerned about consumer privacy.", "authors": ["Mary Meisenzahl"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da737254af90940750b64d4?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
