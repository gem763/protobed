Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Tuesday morning tore into Facebook following a report containing leaked audio from the company\u2019s top executive and founder.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed a question about Warren\u2019s plan to break up big tech companies during an internal Q&A session and expressed concern about the prospect. According to the leaked audio, obtained by The Verge, the social-media titan said: \u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg added, according to the audio: \u201cBut look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d\n\nWarren responded on Twitter by saying: \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent Facebook post, Zuckerberg confirmed the authenticity of the audio: \u201cEven though it was meant to be internal rather than public, now that it\u2019s out there, you can check it out if you're interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I'm thinking and telling employees on a bunch of topics.\u201d\n\nAt issue is a sweeping proposal Warren introduced in March to break up major tech companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google. The plan from the Massachusetts Democrat entailed unwinding major mergers like Amazon\u2019s ownership of Whole Foods and Zappos, Facebook\u2019s ownership of WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google\u2019s ownership of Waze, Nest, and DoubleClick as well as requiring companies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion and more to be designated as \u201cplatform utilities,\u201d subject to new regulations and restrictions.\n\nThe social-media giant specifically has become the target of ire among many Democratic presidential candidates, for its misuse of data and allowance for a Russian disinformation campaign on the platform during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
