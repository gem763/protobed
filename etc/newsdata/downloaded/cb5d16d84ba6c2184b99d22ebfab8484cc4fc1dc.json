At the same time, the number and the total value of equity trade orders clients placed through the digital private banking platform have increased three-fold and six-fold respectively in the last three months.\n\n\"We sought feedback from clients in designing our digital solutions. We asked them about their preferences in terms of the functionalities, usability and how they wanted to make decisions on a digital platform,\" Wade says.\n\nThe consultation process indicated clients prefer a personalised portfolio view so they can see their assets any time they want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They want a simple, consolidated view of financial status, performance, upcoming corporate events and the ability to drill down into details. They also want the bank's insights and options on how to respond to financial markets, within the context of their portfolio,\" he says.\n\nCredit Suisse's clients tend to be wealthy individuals and many of their financial demands are highly complex. So it is not just about a digital solution: they also require the insights of experienced bankers to help them guide their decisions.\n\n\"For example, our clients look at wealth planning across generations and often require integrated options across private and investment banking that cover their corporate as well as their personal wealth needs. These requirements cannot yet be serviced via a digitalised automated platform.\n\n\"As a result, clients continue to value the collaboration with the relationship manager and the bank,\" Wade says.\n\nCredit Suisse's digital private banking offering delivers around-the-clock access to comprehensive information about their accounts, market insights and intelligence, personalised according to their portfolio.\n\n\"Importantly, while clients are empowered with timely information and research, they are also equipped with trading tools that enable them to respond to moving markets,\" Wade says.\n\nThe app is available for download on supported iPad, iPhone and Android mobile devices and is also accessible via web browser.\n\nCredit Suisse is among a number of banks developing a sophisticated digital banking offering for clients. CommSec is another institution that has launched new functionality for its wealthy investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBig benefit\n\n\"The launch of PayID earlier this year was a big moment for financial services in Australia and meaningfully improves the banking experience for customers who are actively transacting across multiple institutions,\" says Brian Phelps, general manager of CommSec's retail distribution business.\n\nPayID offers people an easy way to send money to and from financial institutions. It is supported by the New Payments Platform, which is new infrastructure that underpins the Australian financial services sector.\n\n\"As high net worth customers on the whole have multiple banking relationships, this represents a big benefit for their transaction needs,\" he says.\n\nNeil Slonim, The Bank Doctor, says the major attraction of banking apps for high net worth people is their convenience and accessibility.\n\n\"Users can do their banking 24/7 wherever they may be in the world. There's no need to visit branches or wait to talk to someone in a call centre. This is particularly attractive to people who travel frequently as well as those who are time poor,\" says Slonim.\n\nHe says apps also make it easier for users to maintain financial records as well as plan how they can manage their finances.\n\nSays Slonim: \"Some may have concerns about cyber crime but it is unlikely users of apps are exposed to any higher risk that those who rely on traditional forms of banking.\"", "description": "Some of the earliest adopters of new technologies are often high net worth investors, so it comes as no surprise they have fully embraced all the new digital tools.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.4619%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1732%2C$x_176%2C$y_312/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7ce31d20d07cbac22da80cf4484d23d6f995842e", "published_at": "2018-07-10"}
