It\u2019s so untrue\u2026it\u2019s a bit frustrating as well, actually, especially being a female in comedy. But I think eventually, hopefully, it will die down \u2013 it\u2019s much better than it used to be but it\u2019s still kind of there still.\u201d\n\nWriter and actor Gething, who is inspired by Python and The Mighty Boosh, says her favourite kind of comedy is \u201crandom humour\u201d and argues that films such as Bridesmaids have shown that different sorts of humour are not gender-specific.\n\nMotherland to return in diverse BBC comedy lineup Read more\n\n\u201cI love Bridesmaids; the bit where in the wedding dress shop [they get] food poisoning. I love it, it\u2019s so funny \u2026 It\u2019s a lot more real \u2013 girls do do that sort of thing.\u201d\n\nGething started making videos with her younger brother on an old camera , then moved onto TikTok before graduating onto longer sketches on YouTube where she was spotted by the BBC.\n\nShe says that because of technology there are now \u201cmany different platforms to share so much comedy\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are so many more opportunities to show your programme to get commissioned\u2026it\u2019s great the diversity of comedy [around].\u201d\n\nWith the BBC now facing an existential crisis as it competes for younger viewers with tech giants such as Netflix and YouTube, according to regulator Ofcom, the corporation hopes that shows such as Gething\u2019s will attract the next generation.\n\nGething thinks her new outlet will not be much of a departure for her fans, especially as the BBC\u2019s bigger budget will mean more content for them: \u201cI don\u2019t think my audience will find it that different, I think they will enjoy it the same or even more \u2026 fingers crossed they will like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe BBC has grown and created so many great shows for young audiences\u201d, she says adding that they, \u201cwill find good content if it\u2019s out there.\u201d\n\nThe Amelia Gething Complex, which is available on BBC iPlayer before going out on BBC Two later this year, is based in a flat and features actors Jasmin Hinds and Natalia Hinds as Amelia\u2019s best friends, as well as Alex Griffin-Griffiths as their unusual neighbour. The surreal series gently satirises other flatshare comedies such as Friends.\n\nAccording to Gething entertainment is in her blood, with her family having the same \u201codd sense of humour\u201d. She says that every person in her family is \u201csome kind of performer\u201d, including her granddad who is in a band dressed as the Grim Reaper.\n\nCommenting on her similarity to actor Anne Hathaway, Gething says: \u201cI\u2019d love to do the sort of things she [Anne] does. I see comments every single day saying has anyone ever told you you look like Anne Hathaway, it\u2019s so cool.\u201d", "description": "Public broadcaster launches show led by 20-year-old comedian with 7m followers aiming to attract younger viewers", "authors": ["Tara Conlan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11e61218a38d98b091e5a7645e49d546b99786ff/0_461_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ec97ed0a586015e8a15c11676d931311", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
