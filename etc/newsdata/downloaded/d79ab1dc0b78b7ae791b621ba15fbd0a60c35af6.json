Then there was a clash of heads and I got cut again.\u201d\n\nThe referee paused the fight in the sixth round to have the cut inspected, and that seemed to be the wake up call needed to ignite the 6-foot-9-inch boxer.\n\nFury came alive in the middle to late rounds, pounding Wallin with close range shots though not finishing him. The final round proved a wild finish as Fury went for the kill before being hit with a powerful left from the southpaw Wallin.\n\nWallin (20-1) entered the night undefeated but untested by notable competition. The 28-year-old exceeded expectations in an entertaining clash.\n\n\u201cI did everything I could, I tried my best and Tyson is a great champion,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody can question my heart or question that I\u2019m a good fighter.\u201d\n\nFury (29-0-1) is now scheduled to fight a rematch in February with Deontay Wilder with whom he fought to a controversial draw last December.\n\n\u201cDeontay Wilder, I want you next, bum,\u201d Fury claimed. \u201cThat\u2019s my fourth fight, it has put me in good stead for the big dosser, February 22nd. Let the cut heal, have some time to relax with the family.\u201d", "description": "Britain's Tyson Fury overcame an early cut over his right eye to win a majority decision against his gutsy Swedish opponent Otto Wallin in Las Vegas on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430026684&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E03O", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
