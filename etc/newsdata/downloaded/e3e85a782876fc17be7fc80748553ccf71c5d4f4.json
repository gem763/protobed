This horribly institutionalised sexism naturally bred generations of women encouraged to see themselves as inferior and created state-sanctioned market forces for infanticide and child-trafficking. Baby girls were routinely abandoned or sold to \u201corphanages\u201d that would sell them on to customers in the west \u2013 a practice horribly comparable to Ireland\u2019s Magdalen laundries but on a more massive scale.\n\nMeanwhile, an entire propaganda culture grew up around this idealised one-child family: on playing cards, stickers, posters and in travelling opera performances. The film shows how China\u2019s contemporary artists have drawn on this strident tradition to create their own bitterly satirical artworks, such as The Thoughts of Chairman Mao, by Peng Wang, which shows individual pages of the little red book, each horribly emblazoned with an aborted foetus. (The film\u2019s most unwatchable section shows photographs of foetuses left in rubbish dumps.)\n\nNanfu returns to her hometown to confront the people from her village who were complicit. And she broods on how, paradoxically, depriving women of choice is still embraced by some in her adopted homeland of the United States. Nanfu\u2019s mother says defiantly that the policy was necessary or China would have turned to \u201ccannibalism\u201d.\n\nI would have liked (in a spirit of devil\u2019s advocacy) to hear from an economist about the measurable benefits or otherwise of this brutal approach, and perhaps to ponder the climbing global population. These reservations hardly diminish the film\u2019s force.\n\n\u2022 One Child Nation is released in the UK on 27 September.", "description": "This powerful and upsetting documentary examines the legacy of a brutal policy that limited couples to a single baby", "authors": ["Peter Bradshaw"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fb749c12df3cddf8d476db4f35e71adcec6e49e/52_0_2811_1687/master/2811.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c04233934d222b28f33a953fb4548987", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
