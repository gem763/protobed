The museum is a fantastic way to spread the message that there is nothing shameful or offensive about vaginas and vulvas.\"\n\nThe Vagina Museum has also collaborated with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to engage women in conversations about some of the taboos that exist around women's health.\n\n\"Both organisations share a common mission of spreading knowledge and raise awareness of gynaecological anatomy and health,\" said Dr Alison Wright, vice president of the organisation. \"We believe the museum will be a huge asset to help people to understand women's health and to talk about it more openly.\"\n\nThe museum, based at Camden Market, will host exhibitions, workshops and film screenings on topics including body image, consent, mental health and sexuality.\n\nThe museum's outreach programme will encourage healthy and inclusive sex and relationships education, and will work with doctors and medical professionals to offer services and support to the trans and intersex - people who do not fit the biological definition of male or female - communities.\n\nZoe Williams, development and marketing manager for the museum, told the BBC: \"So far the response has been very, very positive. We are really overwhelmed by how many people are saying what a good idea it is.\n\n\"With our outreach work we want to bust myths and we really firmly believe in inclusion and acceptance for everyone.\"\n\nMs Schechter added that the museum, which will not charge for admission, will be inclusive of all genders because \"not everyone who has a vagina is a woman, and not every woman has a vagina\".\n\nIts first exhibition, Muff Busters: Vagina Myths and How To Fight Them, will open on November 16 and run in to the new year.", "description": "The museum, in London, will feature art exhibitions, plays, workshops and comedy nights.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D71A/production/_108866055_vaginamuseum1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
