Mazloum Abdi, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) commander, told Fox News how they tracked al-Baghdadi after the caliphate fell.\n\nThe general said the informant \u201ctold us that he moved west to Idlib, and to a specific house. We told American intelligence on May 15, and together set up a secret cell, which had three Americans in it.\u201d\n\nThe SDF informant told them about the tunnels under the compound, how many people were with al-Baghdadi, and that he was planning to move, having been at that location for months. That\u2019s when the U.S. carried out the attack at the compound Saturday, and brought out the informant safely.\n\nInformants within ISIS are extremely rare. To have one so close to the leader is unheard of, and a remarkable achievement for Kurdish forces.\n\nMazloum said the raid could not have been possible without Kurdish intelligence.\n\nPICTURED: MILITARY DOG THAT HELPED U.S. FORCES TAKE DOWN AL-BAGHDADI\n\nSeparately, a senior U.S. defense official described the SDF as a \u201ckey player\u201d in the operation but noted the SDF and Kurds did not fly in with U.S. forces. The official said 11 children who were in the al-Baghdadi compound were \u201cphysically turned over to a trusted individual in the area.\u201d\n\nMazloum also talked about the aftermath of President Trump's recent decision to pull troops from northeastern Syria -- a move critics say left Kurds who'd faithfully helped the U.S. contain ISIS vulnerable to a Turkish invasion.\n\n\u201cAfter the Americans pulled out, the Turks invaded, and we had no choice but to do a deal with the Syrian government and Russians. They were able to protect us. So, the Syrians moved to the border in place of the Americans.\u201d\n\nFox News saw this, along with numerous cease-fire violations at the northern Syria front on Sunday. Syrian government forces took up their positions right opposite Turkish forces, which were just over half a mile away.\n\nThe Kurds said in the long run, they just couldn\u2019t push back the Turkish Army themselves.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGun battles raged, and Turkish drone strikes and gunfire were regularly observed.\n\nMazloum also opened up about the future in Syria, saying it wasn\u2019t too late for the U.S. to come back and protect the Kurds. \u201cOur relationship with President Trump depends on him fulfilling his promise of protecting us.\u201d\n\nFox News' Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report.", "description": "The U.S. raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was months in the making\u00a0and involved significant intelligence from Kurdish allies in Syria \u2013 including a rare informant at the heart of ISIS who was inside the compound at the time of the raid, Fox News has learned.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hall"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/28/694940094001_6098504885001_6098505058001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
