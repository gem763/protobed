Key Takeaways\n\nLook out for Days on Market: Watch for houses that have been listed for a long time. There must be a reason why they have not yet sold, so you can land a great deal therein.\n\nMake Low Ball Offers: Bid lower than what sellers are asking for if you are not in a rush to buy. In various scenarios, a low ball offer can prove to be a good home buying strategy.\n\nConsider buying Power of Sale Properties: Foreclosure homes are the ones where homeowners are in default of paying regular mortgage payments and a lender has a right to sell it to recover their equity. So, keep an eye on foreclosure listings, as usually these properties are priced at the market value or even lower since the bank wants to sell them quickly.\n\nHaunted or Stigmatized Properties: Any house with an unpleasant history behind it can easily turn down interest of many prospective buyers. Just don\u2019t give a ghost a chance and you can end up buying a good deal.\n\nEstate Sales: This a sale of the property owned by a person who is recently deceased. Due to emotional factors involved in this process, you can potentially get a drastically reduced price for a quick sale.\n\nGrow Op Properties: These are the properties that were used for the production of marijuana.
