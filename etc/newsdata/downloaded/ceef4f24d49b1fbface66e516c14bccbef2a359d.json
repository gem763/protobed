Ford will sail from the shipyard this month where she was built to a Navy shipyard, marking a major milestone in her progression into U.S. Navy service. One thing that won\u2019t be ready on the ship, are nine of the eleven electromagnetically powered elevators that carry munitions from the ship\u2019s magazine to the hangar. The Secretary of the Navy claims he told President Trump to fire him if the elevators weren\u2019t fully operational by the time the ship is delivered to the sea service.\n\n\n\nThe USS Ford is the first of a new class of nuclear powered aircraft carriers. One of several new features onboard the ship are her eleven Advanced Weapon Elevators, or AWEs. Weapons elevators lift bombs, missiles, and other munitions from the magazine below to aircraft waiting in the hangar. Older elevators are hydraulically powered and can lift 10,500 pounds of munitions at 100 feet per minute. The AWEs, by comparison, can lift 20,000 pounds of munitions at a rate of 150 feet per minute. That\u2019s a pretty significant leap in capability.\n\nThe AWEs use electromagnetic propulsion to lift, similar in principle to the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) catapults that fling aircraft off the flight deck. EMALS is apparently fixed but AWE is not.\n\nPhoto credit: U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Zachary Melvin More\n\nA Navy public affairs officer quoted by U.S. Naval Institute News seems to indicate that the elevators were built for the first time aboard the carrier while being developed, a manufacturing process known as concurrency.\n\n\u201cDue to the concurrent nature of development and construction, the shipboard AWEs have been test beds for identifying many of the remaining developmental and production issues for this first-in-class system, including issues with producing the tight tolerances required for the impacted doors and hatches,\u201d Hernandez told USNI News. The Navy is continuing to troubleshoot the problem, building a \u201cland-based test site\u201d and a software twin to fix it.\n\nIn March, the Navy delayed the delivery of Ford from July to October in order to get the elevators working. Ford was already two years late and several billion over budget.\n\nThe failure to fix the elevators is a problem for the carrier, which is scheduled to undertake its first cruise in 2021. It\u2019s also a problem for Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer, who promised President Trump he could fire him if the Navy could not fix the AWEs before delivery. According to USNI News, Spencer discussed the issue with Trump and said:\n\n\u201cI asked him to stick his hand out; he stuck his hand out. I said, let\u2019s do this like corporate America. I shook his hand and said, the elevators will be ready to go when she pulls out or you can fire me.\u201d\n\nIn a new statement the Secretary of the Navy made no reference to the elevator problem or his offer to be fired if they can\u2019t be fixed, stating that the \u201ccrew and ship are ready to go to sea.\u201d\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "After years of work, the ship still isn't 100 percent fixed.", "authors": ["Kyle Mizokami"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tsDu7_kmBGvOBAbaQJm6fw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_mechanics_642/068027259bba87998ace670b228fa6ba", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
