She also bought them bicycles, signed them up for karate and dancing clubs and replaced the family clunker with a \u201cmore reliable\u201d 15-year-old Opel.\n\nNow Staszewska is planning to help Law & Justice win a second term in an election on Sunday. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said the vote is Poland\u2019s most important since breaking with communism because it will determine whether the sweeping overhauls of the past four years take hold. Opinion polls show the party is on course for victory again.\n\nFrom the outside, the election looks like another culture clash between those allied to the European mainstream and the nationalist forces that have transformed Poland into a rogue from one of the continent\u2019s most reliable partners. The government boosted control over the economy, the media and the courts and increased the influence of the Catholic Church, while the European Union has repeatedly sued the government for flouting the rule of law.\n\nQuicktakePoland\u2019s Populist Turn\n\nBut Silesia, with pockets of poorer areas struggling with pollution, depopulation and the slow demise of mining, it\u2019s viewed through a different lens. In Poland\u2019s faded industrial heartland, it\u2019s all about making ends meet, and like in the rust-belt states of the U.S. voting for Donald Trump or the former manufacturing regions of Brexit Britain, voters like Staszewska provide key support for a divisive political project.\n\n\u201cWorse-off people were invisible for almost three decades but thanks to Law & Justice, it\u2019s no longer so,\u201d said Staszewska, 39, an assistant at a school for children with disabilities in Katowice. \u201cThere\u2019s a link between someone who can afford a bike and that young person\u2019s dignity.\u201d\n\nLaw & Justice, under the guidance of founder and leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, has piled resources into winning Silesia, which traditionally voted with the pro-EU opposition.\n\nRead More: The Plane Crash That Helped One Man Take Over a Nation\n\nWith a rich history drawing from Prussian and Austrian periods of domination, Silesia became a regional business hub during the industrial revolution. Its coal and steel then became the bedrock of communist development. The region, which is roughly the size of Connecticut, ethnically is still a rare mix in mainly homogeneous Poland.\n\nBut as unprofitable mines shut and industry moved out, some 500,000 people, or about 10% of the population, departed while the remains a black hole on European pollution maps.\n\nA good showing in Silesia, which is allotted 55 of the 460 seats in Poland\u2019s powerful lower house of parliament, will strengthen Law & Justice\u2019s possible repeat majority. Morawiecki, who was handpicked by Kaczynski as premier in December 2017, is campaigning from Katowice and the city has enjoyed unusual perks, such as hosting a military parade.\n\n\u201cThere are opinions that who wins Silesia, wins Poland,\u201d said Tomasz Slupik, a political scientist at the University of Silesia in the city. \u201cThe campaign is simply the crowning of the remarkably populist Law & Justice agenda.\u201d\n\nEvidence shows policies are working, with a reduction in poverty, especially among children. The government has pumped 126 billion zloty ($32 billion) of new benefits directly into Polish wallets since 2016, equivalent to more than 5% of gross domestic product. To win a second term, it has pledged to build a \u201cPolish welfare state\u201d and nearly double the minimum wage over four years.\n\nRead More: Has Poland\u2019s Government Become a Threat to Business?\n\nBusiness lobbies, meanwhile, have warned the spiralling wage costs could price them out of supply chains and crimp one of Europe\u2019s fastest growing economies.\n\nBut investors have barely shrugged. Poland offers 1.9% yields on 10 years bonds, nowadays more than debt-ridden Greece. So far, the country\u2019s budget has held up, boosted by improvements in tax collection and the consumption boom, although the World Bank warned this week that the welfare burden may soon inflate the deficit back to the EU\u2019s limit.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- For single mother Katarzyna Staszewska, the change of government in Poland four years ago meant her family got to splash in the sea for the first time.Welfare payments introduced by the Law & Justice party allowed her to take her four kids on vacation to the Baltic coast, six hours away", "authors": ["Dorota Bartyzel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QeeO6G0ZU_1y1W7zwn.8kQ--~B/aD03OTA7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/1133a50b4d4f4a03dae8fdf65a1414a6", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
