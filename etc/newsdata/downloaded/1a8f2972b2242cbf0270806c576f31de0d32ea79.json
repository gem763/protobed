Also, ever since I was a kid, I wanted to live in a house that backed on to a park and now I\u2019m living the dream.\n\nRELATED: Tamsyn Manou, nee Lewis, and cricketer Graham Manou list Brighton townhouse\n\nEast Melbourne auction: apartment sells $1.18 million above reserve\n\nBrian Schrapel: Olympic equestrian set to auction Tallarook property\n\nMost memorable home you\u2019ve lived in?\n\nMy childhood home, which had a massive oak tree with a swing hanging off it that was the centre of all activities. Also, my apartment in Perth because it was my first purchase and also where I lived during the peak of my sporting career, the base to return to after big sporting trips.\n\nAre you a keen or reluctant property buyer?\n\nKeen. In Australia, the best asset you can own is your home. It sets you up for security in the long term. The effort and work it takes to get into your first home are worth it.\n\nHow many homes have you ever bought and ever sold?\n\nI\u2019ve bought three homes and sold two. I have also bid for other people in auctions many times and have won two.\n\nThe highlights of your property journey?\n\nWorking in the property industry and getting to be involved in developments that house thousands of Australians.\n\nThe lowlights?\n\nSelling my East Melbourne terrace. I bought it in 2010 when I was living in Perth as my dream location when I moved back to Melbourne. But, through a series of events, I couldn\u2019t hold on to it.\n\nBest property advice you\u2019ve heard?\n\nHold on to it. It\u2019s not a short-term play. If you look back through the history of property ownership in Australia, people who have held on to property through at least one or two property cycles have always done well.\n\nMORE: Seddon auction: young buyers drive townhouse $100,000 past reserve\n\nJason Johannisen: Western Bulldogs star sells Prahran pad\n\nWorld War II bunker conversion: Yelta property for sale as a house\n\nWorst property advice you\u2019ve heard?\n\nBuy an apartment off the plan. You just don\u2019t see the same level of growth in this type of asset class as other types, and it\u2019s so easy for supply to rapidly increase.\n\nTips for homebuyers?\n\nIf you love where you live and can\u2019t afford a house with land in that area, I would rent where you want to live and invest in house and land where your budget permits.\n\nFuture property plans?\n\nMany property plans on the business front. On the personal front, ultimately, I would like to have a bit of land within two hours\u2019 drive of Melbourne to spend weekends.", "description": "It took just a few moments for Steve Hooker to nail his gold medal-winning vault in Beijing, but in property he\u2019s playing the long game.
