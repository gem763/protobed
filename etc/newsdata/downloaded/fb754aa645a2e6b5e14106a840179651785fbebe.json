A few clicks and I\u2019m done. Luckily there was still an aisle seat open.\n\nSeconds later an electronic boarding pass lands in my phone\u2019s digital wallet and, as I only have a carry-on bag for my one-night work trip to Johannesburg, I move swiftly past all the long queues straight through security to my boarding gate without any inconvenience caused.\n\nThis is my favourite part of traveling. The weird space in time between arriving at the airport and getting onto your flight. Those strange few hours where everything blissfully hangs in limbo for a while.\n\nAs is my routine I slip on my Bluetooth earphones and select the Spotify playlist from my last trip to Rome as I grab a coffee, pay with a tap of my phone, and wander around the departure area. I could be anyone going anywhere. A foreigner exploring a new continent, perhaps an architect on his way to an important client somewhere, a husband, a dad, a famous actor trying to stay incognito - these are all scenarios I\u2019ve dreamed up whilst browsing airport bookstores.\n\nThese days I hardly ever buy print copies anymore (I\u2019ve got everything available online with a quick connection to the airport\u2019s free WiFi), but I still like to browse anyway.\n\nThis time something catches my eye.\n\nIn the right-hand corner of a giant shelve cluttered with magazines, both local and international, the cover of Esquire\u2019s September/October UK edition grabs my attention.\n\nIt\u2019s a striking image of American TV and film star LaKeith Stanfield wearing a multi-coloured printed muslin oversized bowling shirt whilst standing in front of a blossoming pink bougainvillea, a thick gold chain around his neck underneath his bushy beard. The photo taken by Micaiah Carter paints a picture that effortlessly balances between masculinity and femininity, the modern and the nostalgic.\n\nI grab it from the shelf. It\u2019s thick. The glossy cover silky under my fingers. It\u2019s imported, converted from pounds, and thus unnecessarily expensive. But I buy it anyway so I can read it on the plane in the two-hour gap when flight-mode forces me to exist offline.\n\nIt\u2019s big and clunky and I keep switching it between hands as I try to sip my coffee, have my ID book handy, and unlock my phone screen so the stewardess can check me in at the boarding gate.\n\nWhen I finally find my seat, put my bag away, and get comfortable enough to read, I open the magazine. Its pages are stiff at first and I fumble uncomfortably with it until I turn my food tray into a reading table. I start from the very first page and read every line I possibly can.\n\nStories about Gorgio Armani in Japan, one writer\u2019s trip on a river boat in Egypt, and another\u2019s safari in Zimbabwe. There are stories about loafers, house plants, and the first watch that was ever used on the moon. For almost two hours I disappear into the printed pages and travel across the globe - although my flight will only be landing at OR Tambo.\n\nI guess as a digital native I have no time or space for print in my life anymore, until I lose my WiFi connection somewhere in the air above the South African landscape.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve discovered a secret treasure chest in a different world suspended in time. Neither here nor there - somewhere in the sky among the clouds and the Cloud I found that there\u2019s still a place for print.\n\nThe strangest part of it all? I wrote this article on my phone on the flight back to Cape Town.
