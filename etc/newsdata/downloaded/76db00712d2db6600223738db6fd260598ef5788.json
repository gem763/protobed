In 2019 alone, the program has netted roughly 3,200 tips, according to officials.\n\nNYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said at a news conference at the department\u2019s headquarters that he hopes the new app would generate even more information for investigations.\n\n\u201cWhen we really connect to the public, and get more and more people involved, get the store owners involved, the parents, the people that live and work in the communities, we are unstoppable,\u201d Mr. Shea said.\n\nThe NYPD\u2019s free app, known as CS-NYC, allows users to send video and photos in addition to text.

The program is operated in a public-private partnership between the NYPD and the New York City Police Foundation.\n\nUntil now, most Crime Stoppers tips have been generated through calls to the program\u2019s hotline, 1-800-577-TIPS. Many tips come in reaction to requests for information on crimes from the NYPD, including images of suspects circulated in the news media.\n\nThe new CS-NYC app, which is available for both Apple iOS and Android devices, expands the system\u2019s capability by allowing users to send video and photos in addition to text. Police officials said the app offers total anonymity to users, who are identified only by numerical code. The officials said the CS-NYC app cost less than $3,000 to create because it was mostly built using existing technology.\n\nThe NYPD\u2019s new app could be a powerful tool for the department, said Eugene O\u2019Donnell, a professor of law and police studies at Manhattan\u2019s John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s policing 101 that one of law enforcement\u2019s strongest tools is the community,\u201d Prof. O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cAnything that helps police access that infinite amount of information is potentially promising.\u201d\n\nWrite to Ben Chapman at Ben.Chapman@wsj.com", "description": "The New York Police Department has released a mobile phone app that members of the public can use for sending anonymous tips.", "authors": ["Ben Chapman"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106772/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
