(Erin Scott/Reuters)\n\nThe Trump administration has set the cap on the number of refugees admitted to the United States next year at 18,000, the lowest level since the program began four decades ago, officials said Thursday.\n\nThe new limit represents a 40 percent drop from the 2019 cap and marks the third consecutive year that the administration has slashed the program since the United States admitted nearly 85,000 refugees in President Barack Obama\u2019s final year in office.\n\nIn addition, the Trump White House announced an executive order aimed at allowing local jurisdictions more leeway in rejecting refugees who are being resettled across the country, although experts said such powers are less relevant at a time when the number of refugees being admitted has dwindled sharply.\n\nDetails of the refugee plan come as the Trump administration also has pursued a wide-ranging ban on asylum seekers from Central America, in response to a surge of families that strained federal resources and created a humanitarian crisis at the southern border in the spring.\n\nTaken together, the actions represent an assault on legal immigration programs that have long defined U.S. policy toward vulnerable and targeted groups of foreigners seeking protection from political persecution, violence or other conflicts, pro-immigration groups said.\n\n\u201cAmerica was once a beacon of hope to those suffering under oppression,\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said in a statement. \u201cRefugees fleeing violence and persecution come to the United States in search of a better life. They should be welcomed with compassion and understanding, not turned away or have their children taken from them at the border. We\u2019re better than that. Sadly, the administration\u2019s low refugee number says otherwise.\u201d\n\nUnder the plan for fiscal 2020, which begins Oct. 1, the administration would allocate 5,000 refugee slots to refugees fleeing for religious reasons, 4,000 for Iraqis who assisted the United States and fall under the Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act of 2007, and 1,500 for nationals of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, according to senior administration officials. Another 7,500 slots would go to refugees not covered by these categories, including those referred to the program by U.S. embassies.\n\nLast year\u2019s 30,000 cap divided slots by region, including 11,000 refugees from Africa, the largest group, administration officials said. Latin America and the Caribbean had 3,000 slots last year.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union said a \u201clarge majority\u201d of refugees admitted in 2016 were people of color and almost half were Muslim, groups that the Trump administration\u2019s policies have increasingly barred from seeking refuge in the United States. Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, called the latest cap \u201csickening.\u201d\n\nIn a background briefing for reporters, the officials emphasized that the United States remains among the world\u2019s most generous countries in accepting refugees. They cited the need to divert resources to handle a huge backlog of asylum cases as a factor in their decision to reduce the refu\u00adgee cap.\n\nAsylum-seekers are those seeking legal protections from another country whose cases have yet to be adjudicated, while refugees have met requirements for protection under international law.\n\nIn a statement, Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, echoed the administration\u2019s contention that migrants who are seeking to abuse the asylum system to gain entry to the country have created \u201can unprecedented asylum workload\u201d on his agency.\n\nFederal authorities have taken into custody more than 800,000 people at the U.S.-Mexico border over the past 11 months, already the highest single-year total in a dozen years. Cuccinelli said the proposed refugee cap \u201ctakes into account our existing and anticipated humanitarian workload on all fronts and fulfills our primary duty to protect and serve U.S. citizens.\u201d\n\nOfficials say there is an existing backlog of approximately 1 million asylum claims before the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service and the Justice Department\u2019s immigration courts.\n\nThough the United States had long been the leading nation for admitting and resettling refugees \u2014 surpassing all other countries combined until 2017 \u2014 it has fallen below Canada, which last year admitted 28,000 refugees compared to 22,000 for the United States, according to a U.N. report.\n\nLike previous administrations, the Trump administration has frustrated both parties in Congress for failing to sufficiently consult with key lawmakers before setting the refugee cap. It is legally required to do so in person with the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees before Sept. 30 every year, though Congress has little legal recourse to compel changes to the executive branch\u2019s plans.\n\nA spokeswoman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said no such consultation had occurred. Graham and Feinstein, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan last week, saying \u201cthere has been very limited communication to coordinate consultation.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials described Trump\u2019s executive order as a way to allow state and local governments to refuse to resettle refugees, a decision typically made by the federal government together with nonprofit resettlement agencies.\n\nWhile many cities and towns have warmly welcomed refugees, bitter disputes have erupted in other communities when politicians and others complained that resettlement has burdened taxpayers with increased enrollment in schools and health-care costs. Others have claimed the disputes stemmed more from racism and xenophobia, and said cities and towns should welcome refugees fleeing brutal wars, dictatorships or violence.\n\nAmong the refugees resettled in the United States are families fleeing conflicts in the Congo, Syria and other countries. All have been vetted by the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies and some have waited for years to settle in the United States.\n\nTrump gave the departments of State and Health and Human Services 90 days to create a process by which state and local governments can welcome refugees, in writing, and the State Department will publish those agreements.\n\nBut the impact of Trump\u2019s order is limited, officials said in a media briefing held Thursday on the condition that their names not be revealed to the public. Refugees would be able to travel anywhere in the United States once they are legally admitted to the country, including to cities and towns that publicly refuse to resettle them as a first stop in the United States.\n\nStates that have resettled the most refugees this year are Texas, New York, Washington and California, which account for roughly a quarter of those resettled in fiscal 2019, according to a study by Pew Research Center.\n\n\u201cThis is a very sad day for America,\u201d David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said in a statement. \u201cThis decision represents further damage to America\u2019s leadership on protecting the most vulnerable people around the world.\u201d", "description": "The new cap constitutes another administration effort to restrict legal immigration and includes an order that allows local jurisdictions to reject refugees for resettlement.", "authors": ["David Nakamura", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Maria Sacchetti", "Reporter Covering Immigrant Communities", "Immigration", "Customs Enforcement", "Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gRrdCbhYG6Yd_mUTYWLEfd-5ze0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NASRB3HAUQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
