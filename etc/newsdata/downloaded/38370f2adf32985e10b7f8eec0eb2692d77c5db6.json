In the ultra-premium Manor marquee, guest will dine on a menu prepared by celebrity chef Guillaume Brahimi.\n\nThe ATC\u2019s big partners, including drinks giant Lion, gaming group Tabcorp and casino giant The Star Entertainment Group, will entertain clients in the new complex. And despite the apparent fragility of the economy, The Estate has been close to sold out for every meeting at Randwick this spring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are actually 40 per cent ahead of last year\u2019s results in terms of hospitality sales,\u201d Black says.\n\nShe believes a big part of the attraction for corporate clients is racing\u2019s gender neutral appeal; time-poor guests now want to be able to bring partners if they\u2019re giving up a day of their weekend.\n\nAnd corporate clients want a return on their investment. The regular breaks between races \u2013 nine half times, as Black likes to say \u2013 provide plenty of opportunities to talk shop.\n\n\u201cWhat I hear from clients all the time is if they are going to invest that they need to get value out of it. Having the ability to hold your customer for that many hours and really get value is so important,\u201d Black says.\n\nThe strong sales for The Estates have convinced the ATC to develop the concept further, with Black already investigating a more permanent structure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to have a double-storey facility to really capitalise on the view.\u201d", "description": "Sydney's Australian Turf Club is taking aim at one of Flemington\u2019s sacred sites: the Birdcage enclosure.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3974%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1124%2C$y_157/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/09dda02522da77b10254296af8c91f68bd0ecac3", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
