The report said a large amount of the NCSC's work continued to be defending against hostile state actors.\n\n'We can say that Russia, China, Iran and North Korea continue to pose strategic national security threats to the UK', it warned.\n\nNCSC Chief Executive Ciaran Martin said: 'From handling more than 600 incidents - many from hostile nation states - to equipping the public with the tools they need to stay safe online, we are employing our expertise on a number of fronts.\n\n'I am proud to lead this organisation and optimistic that, in a constantly evolving landscape, we can help make this the safest country to live and work online.'\n\nThe report also highlighted other parts of the centre's work, including:\n\nHow it used new technology to speed up how information about threats is shared. Previously it has taken several hours for officials to be able to share information relating to threats to the UK, but the machine can identify what can be shared in a matter of seconds, though the final decision still lies with a person.\n\nThe centre also runs the Active Cyber Defence (ACD) programme which finds malicious sites and sends notifications to the host to get them removed. It has led to 98% of phishing URLs which were discovered to be malicious being taken down \u2013 a total of 177,335. Of those, 62.4% were removed in the first hour.\n\nOfficials meet with UK political parties every three months and provide cyber security advice in a bid to protect the democratic process, something it did during this year's local and European elections.\n\nOliver Dowden, Cabinet Office minister responsible for the country's cyber security strategy, said the report showed the success of efforts to make the 'the UK a more challenging place for our cyber adversaries to operate in'.\n\nHe added: 'Any digital economy must be alert to new threats, and to changes in existing threats.\n\n'The NCSC operates in a complex landscape in which the contours are constantly changing and there is no room for complacency.\n\n'Securing the internet is a 24/7 challenge, 365 days a year, and cannot be shouldered by any one organisation.\n\n'This is a long-term mission, and I congratulate the NCSC for helping to build a pipeline of specialist talent for the future to achieve this.'\n\nOn Monday it emerged the centre had rumbled an alleged Russia-based group of cyber hackers masquerading as Iranian crooks after targeting a UK victim.\n\nIt spent more than 18 months investigating the Turla terror group \u2013 which routinely targets governments, the military, technology, energy and commercial organisations to collect intelligence \u2013 after an unnamed 'UK academic organisation' was compromised.\n\nThe centre has also reported the number of girls applying for cyber security courses has risen by nearly 50% in a year.\n\nIt said the number of female applicants was up 47%, and the overall number of those applying rose by 29%.", "description": "The Government's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned 56 banks that they were at risk of fraudulent withdrawal of funds using cloned cards.", "authors": ["Larisa Brown Defence And Security Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/00/wire-20060466-1571786038-400_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
