Across all generations, and especially with older age groups, brands need to build trust by being open about how they use data, and clear about the added value it enables them to deliver.\u201d\n\nThe study also revealed that 52 percent of Gen Z members engage with companies that place advertisements online, which is 22 percent more than the remaining three generational age groups who voted only 30 percent.\n\nGen Z also happen to be the most trusting of the four generational groups when it comes to the internet, with 28 of the youngsters believing online brands \u2018do the right thing\u2019 when it comes to their data, compared to just 17 percent of the far more internet-distrusting and cynical group of Baby Boomers.\n\nGen Z also place the highest value on exclusive experiences when compared to their older generational counterparts, with 28 percent willing to exchange their data to get such exclusive offerings.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nMeanwhile, a whopping 73 percent of Baby Boomers said they were willing to exchange their data for discounts or special offers, which was something Gen Z members did not prioritize nearly as much, with only 47 percent willing to do so.", "description": "Members of Gen Z are the most likely to be influenced online when compared to members of Millennials, Gen X, and Baby Boomers, a recent survey found.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2017/11/0/0/a5a1c863-social_network.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
