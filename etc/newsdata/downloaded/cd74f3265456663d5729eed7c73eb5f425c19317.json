Two of the parcels abut the mouth of Southport Harbor off Long Island Sound.\n\nMore: One of Connecticut\u2019s \u2018Grand Old Ladies\u2019 Will Ask $6.7 Million\n\n\"They are all already divided, and therefore you could sell them off if that is in the best interest of the [new owner],\" Ms. Ryan said. \"That, in itself, brings a lot of value.\"\n\nThe largest of the swaths, the only one that is currently developed, accommodates the main residence and a guest house. The former was built in 2005, the year when the latter emerged through a remodel of a 1930s boat house.\n\nThe home, an expansive hulk of stone and shingles topped with a peaked roof, exudes a time-tested Nantucket aesthetic, rendered by architect Mark Finlay, whose luxury creations bead the East Coast.\n\nInside, the entryway leads to a cavernous living room\u2014\"large enough to be able to throw a football,\" Mr. Ryan said\u2014that centers around the natural setting of the property. Through large windows and French doors, the surrounding water-borne vistas spill into this space.\n\nMore: What Tax Changes Can I Expect in Greenwich, Connecticut?\n\nMeanwhile, a cathedral ceiling crests over the kitchen and the family room, whose layout turns the high-end ambience into a background for family life.\n\n\"As large and as vast as it is, it really is a comfortable family home,\" Ms. Ryan said.\n\nAnd it\u2019s got its upscale quirks too. In the bedroom suite, for instance, an auxiliary closet rests behind the main one in the quarters set for the mistress of the house. Those catering to the master, on the other hand, vaunt a secret staircase that swoops down to the office.\n\nStats\n\nThe 15,000-square-foot residence lies on a 2.5-acre lot, the largest of the four parcels that coalesce for a total of over 5.5 acres.\n\nAmong the 17 rooms of the house, six are bedrooms, seven are full bathrooms and two are half baths. An additional bedroom and a bathroom, along with a full-service kitchen, shape the guest house.\n\nThe property has 350 feet of water frontage, one-third of which forms a private sandy beach.\n\nMore: Single-Family Home Prices in Greenwich, Connecticut, Rise, While Sales Fall\n\nAmenities\n\nThe estate boasts an infinity pool with a cabana, a golf simulator, a wine cellar and an all-glass solarium. The latter is a room Ms. Ryan has not encountered in other houses.\n\nSitting in it, \"you have a 360-degree view of the entire property and then also out to the water,\" she said.\n\nBy the shore rests the guest house, which has a fire pit-fitted patio that overlooks Southport Harbor. Here, the estate\u2019s private pier stretches for nearly 200 feet into the water.\n\nThe property also comes with a tennis court and hut carved out on a separate lot neighboring the primary abode.\n\n\"You have no need to join a country club when you have an estate like this,\" Ms. Ryan said. \"All your amenities are right here.\"\n\nFrom Penta: Global UHNW Population Flatlines, Combined Wealth Declines for the First Time in Three Years\n\nNeighborhood Notes\n\nPart of Fairfield\u2019s metro area, Southport is a quaint district that grew around the harbor, which once served as a shipping hub along the routes of onion trade. The New England-style homes that sprang infused the community with its district character, which Ms. Ryan calls a \"unique treasure.\"\n\nToday, Southport is an hour away from Manhattan by train, a proximity that makes the area propitious for second and vacation homes. Meanwhile, the excellent local schools attract young families looking for a year-round destination, Ms. Ryan said.\n\nListing agents: Wendy Ryan, Libby McKinney Tritschler and Andrew Whiteley of William Raveis Real Estate\n\nView the original listing.
