And thanks to the Pixel 4 getting leaked to the point of exhaustion, we had a pretty good idea of what to expect heading in. But the tech titan still managed to unveil some surprises on the Google Assistant front, with new applications and integrations across Google\u2019s devices.\n\nPixel 4\n\nWith Pixel 4, Google Assistant allows for easy hands-free navigation between apps and seamless multitasking. For example, as Google demonstrated, Assistant can pull up concert dates, share them with a contact, and transcribe a note to include with the message. Plus, in a super-exciting reveal for the journalists sitting in the room, the Pixel 4\u2019s recorder app will transcribe voice recordings in real-time. To boot, the transcription feature will make finding recordings a whole heck of a lot easier.\n\nPixel Buds 2\n\nThe next generation of Pixel Buds, Google\u2019s foray into the wireless earbud game, will summon Assistant in the same hands-free way that you can across Google\u2019s various other devices, such as for sending a text, asking for directions, or for understanding another language (but, hopefully, better than with the first generation Buds)\u2014particularly when your phone or device isn\u2019t readily in-hand. They\u2019ll retail for $US179 ($264). We don't know if or when they'll hit Australia, but they're hitting the U.S. in Autumn 2020.\n\nNest Wifi Point integration\n\nGoogle added a Google Assistant smart speaker to its Nest Wifi Point, enabling the same functionality as a Nest Mini. It can play music, answer questions, and control other connected devices.\n\nNew voices\n\nIn addition to all these changes, Google also announced some Assistant news ahead of Tuesday\u2019s event\u2014including, notably, that it was bringing Insecure\u2019s Issa Rae to the Assistant. (The company previously brought John Legend\u2019s voice to the Assistant.) With the prompt, \u201cHey Google, talk like Issa,\u201d the Assistant will activate the Emmy-nominated actress\u2019s voice\u2014with a few easter eggs to boot. According to Variety, asking Google Assistant questions like \u201cHey Google, do you have any dating advice?\u201d or \u201cHey Google, are you a writer?\u201d will also prompt messages from Rae. Google said Rae\u2019s voice will be available for a limited time in English in the U.S.\n\nThe company announced back in September that it was bringing more voices in more languages to the Assistant, with more than 30 available. Those can be accessed and selected in the Settings section of the Assistant app.", "description": "Made by Google 2019 is finally underway.
