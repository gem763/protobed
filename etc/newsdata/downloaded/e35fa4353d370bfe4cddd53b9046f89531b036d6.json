Epstein was arrested in July on new, federal charges of sexually abusing dozens of girls in the early 2000s. In August, he was found dead while in federal custody.\n\nThe revelations prompted renewed scrutiny of Epstein's philanthropy and the sometimes complicated relationships between donors and institutions\n\nHarvard's decentralisation makes a review more complicated than it would be at some other institutions, Mr Bacow wrote.\n\nMost of the gifts from Epstein, designated for use on research and education, were spent years ago, Mr Bacow wrote.\n\nThe largest gift, $6.5 million (\u00a35.2m), was given in 2003 for the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and spent by 2007, according to the university.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He said he would convene a group at Harvard to consider how to prevent such situations, and expressed hope that peer institutions could collaborate on solutions.\n\n\"Jeffrey Epstein's crimes were repulsive and reprehensible. I profoundly regret Harvard's past association with him. Conduct such as his has no place in our society. We act today in recognition of that fact . . .\"\n\n\"Harvard is not perfect, but you have my commitment as president that we will always strive to be better.\"\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "Harvard University accepted about $9\u00a0million\u00a0(\u00a37.2 million) in donations from financier Jeffrey Epstein between 1998 and 2007, according to results of an investigation released Thursday evening by the school's president.
