Comprising 58 apartments and 14 strata commercial units, 1953 combines old-world charm with modern design sensibilities.\n\n\n\nOxley Holdings' 1953 is set to be an iconic landmark (Pictures: Oxley Holdings)\n\nSeven of the project\u2019s retail shops and nine residential units will be housed in a row of conservation shophouses, while the rest of the units are part of a new six-storey development. The former will be painted white and feature an art deco fa\u00e7ade while the latter will be dressed in a dark colour palette, contrasting the modern buildings with those steeped in history. Ecoplan, the landscape architect for the project, also made a horticultural selection that accentuates 1953\u2019s colour palette.\n\n\n\nThe living area of a three-bedroom apartment\n\nFor this, 1953 swept the following awards at the EdgeProp Singapore Excellence Awards 2019:\n\nDesign Excellence, Residential (Uncompleted), Central\n\nInnovation Excellence, Residential (Uncompleted), Central\n\nTop Showflat, Interior Designer Excellence Award, Residential (Uncompleted), Central\n\nTop Development, Residential (Uncompleted), Central\n\nTop Boutique Development, Residential (Uncompleted)\n\n\n\nThe en suite bedroom in a three-bedroom apartment\n\nThe architect behind 1953 is Park+Associates. The design of the project takes its cue from Queen\u2019s 1975 song, \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d. Like the song, Park+Associates envisioned the design of 1953 in three parts: ballad, operatic overture and hard rock.\n\n\u201cThe art deco fa\u00e7ade serves as the operatic overture, juxtaposing the conserved historic shophouses (the ballad) and the modern new extension block (hard rock end of Bohemian Rhapsody),\u201d explains Oxley.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy in contrast\n\nFrom the exterior, this design narrative continues in each unit with its contemporary and linear design. To emphasise the shophouse charm, materials such as green subway tiles are used in the bathroom. A capsule-shaped vanity mirror reminiscent of the 50s serves as functional storage.\n\n\n\nMaterials such as green subway tiles are used in the bathroom\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, the kitchen features solid dark grey tones while marble tiles are used for the backsplash. Dark grey subway tiles are also used in the shower area to evoke a feeling of nostalgia.\n\nThe developer has also made 1953 easy to maintain for homeowners. The landscape area, designed by 2nd Edition, is stocked with shady trees that require little care. Bricks \u2013 stable, durable, stylish and eco-friendly \u2013 are also widely used, like on the facilities deck.", "description": "SINGAPORE (EDGEPROP) - Located at the junction of Balestier and Tessensohn Roads, 1953, a mixed-use development by Oxley Holdings, is set to be an iconic landmark when it is completed in 2023.
