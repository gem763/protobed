Mandatory Credit: Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Patriots\u2019 draft pick could be elevated to a sixth-round selection in 2021.\n\nThe teams have yet to confirm the deal for Bennett, who will have been traded three times since March 2018. The Seattle Seahawks shuffled Bennett to the Philadelphia Eagles, before the latter sent the three-time Pro Bowl selection to New England in March of this year.\n\nBennett was suspended by the Patriots for one week for conduct detrimental to the team on Oct. 15. The 11-year veteran sat out New England\u2019s 33-0 romp over the New York Jets on Monday.\n\n\u2014New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and running back Alvin Kamara were limited in practice.\n\nWhile Brees was also limited for Wednesday\u2019s practice, Kamara\u2019s presence on Thursday was an upgrade after he missed the previous session due to separate knee and ankle injuries. Kamara sat out New Orleans\u2019 36-25 victory over the Chicago Bears last Sunday.\n\nBrees has not played since Sept. 15, when he sustained an injury to the thumb on his throwing hand in a game against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\n\u2014Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan sat out practice again due to an ankle injury, putting his streak of 154 consecutive starts in serious jeopardy.\n\nRyan sustained a right ankle sprain Sunday in the fourth quarter of Atlanta\u2019s loss to the Los Angeles Rams. He left the game after being evaluated by team trainers on the sideline and did not return.\n\n\u2014The Jets have informed teams that wide receiver Robby Anderson is available for trade prior to next week\u2019s deadline, the New York Daily News reported.\n\nAnderson, 26, is slated to be an unrestricted free agent after the end of the season. He has 17 receptions for 266 yards and one touchdown in six games this season.\n\n\u2014Cincinnati Bengals left tackle Cordy Glenn downplayed any issue with the team following last week\u2019s one-game suspension following a confrontation with a coach.\n\n\u201cLast week just happened. Stuff happens sometimes,\u201d said Glenn, who was reinstated by the team this week.\n\n\u2014Denver Broncos president John Elway said rookie Drew Lock is not ready to take over the starting job from veteran Joe Flacco, who has guided the team to a 2-5 record.\n\nLock, who was the 42nd overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, is on injured reserve with an ailing thumb on his throwing hand.\n\n\u2014The Detroit Lions signed free agent Marcus Gilchrist, two days after trading fellow safety Quandre Diggs to the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nGilchrist, 30, has 14 career interceptions in 123 games (98 starts) over eight NFL seasons. He had three interceptions while starting all 16 games for the Oakland Raiders in 2018.\n\n\u2014Jacksonville Jaguars defensive tackle Marcell Dareus was scheduled to undergo core muscle surgery that will sideline him for four to six weeks, according to multiple reports.\n\nHe was injured in the Jaguars\u2019 win over the Cincinnati Bengals last Sunday.\n\n\u2014The NFL Players Association issued a statement in support of New York Jets guard Kelechi Osemele, who is scheduled to have shoulder surgery on Friday despite the team\u2019s contention he doesn\u2019t need it right away.\n\nOsemele has missed three games while seeking an operation on a torn labrum. The team wants him to play through the injury this season and has fined him since Saturday for conduct detrimental to the team for each day he missed practice.\n\n\u2014The Cleveland Browns added star defensive end Myles Garrett to the injury report, listed as a limited practice participant due to a knee ailment. There was no word on the severity of the injury.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The Dallas Cowboys will acquire defensive end Michael Bennett from the New England Patriots for a conditional 2021 seventh-round draft pick, multiple media outlets reported on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444699079&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O02Z-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
