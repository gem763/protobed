Min is going abroad, and he offers Ki-woo his gig tutoring the teenage daughter of a wealthy family. Ki-woo accepts, and Min gives him a parting gift: The \u201cscholar\u2019s rock\u201d is a stone the size of a laptop computer, meant to bring luck and money to its owners. \u201cThis is so metaphorical,\u201d Ki-woo says, beaming. If there is some irony in all of this\u2014a family that has almost nothing can\u2019t do much with a giant decorative boulder\u2014Ki-woo doesn\u2019t acknowledge it. He chooses to embrace the symbolism, hugging the slab to his chest as a sign that his family is just about to get everything they deserve. When he heads off for his first day of tutoring, Ki-woo tells his father that he has forged his diploma in order to qualify for the job. He doesn\u2019t consider it a crime; the deception is just a step toward his destiny.\n\nBong Joon-ho often drops metaphors into his films\u2014the protein bars made of cockroaches in Snowpiercer connect with the scuttling but resilient passengers stuck on the back of the train\u2014but it is rare that he makes a character use the word out loud. With the rock metaphor, Bong is setting up a Chekhovian pistol, showing us an explosive scenario and letting us wait for it to blow up. The stone may be a good omen, but it is also heavy; Ki-woo seems to know, deep down, that moving between classes will be a treacherous process. He has to be smart about it, or it will crush him.\n\nAt first, Ki-Woo is thrilled by the opportunity to work for the refined Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun) and his ditzy wife, Yeon-kyo (a very funny Cho Yeo-jeong), tutoring their daughter, Da-hye (Jung Zi-so). The Park residence sits behind a tall, locked gate on a pristine city side street. As Ki-woo enters, he sees a grand, manicured front lawn, a lush shock of green. The housekeeper, Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun), tells him that the building once belonged to a famous Korean architect. Inside, Ki-woo encounters a stark minimalism that would not be out of place in a Silicon Valley mogul\u2019s home (we soon learn that Mr. Park has made his fortune in tech). The house, an airy, open split-level, features modular furniture and a gray and ocher color scheme; it looks more like an art gallery than a family home. Yeon-kyo is equally vacant; she insists on sitting in on Ki-woo\u2019s first lesson with Da-hye, petting her Pomeranian, who just happens to match her dress.\n\nDespite little evidence, Yeon-kyo believes her children to be exceptional geniuses. She tells Ki-woo that her young son, Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun), is a gifted artist, whose crude self-portrait she has proudly displayed on the wall. The child keeps burning through art tutors because no one can properly foster his talent, she says. It is clear that Da-song is not so much a gifted artist as a hyperactive misfit, in need of behavioral help rather than blind encouragement. Still, Ki-woo begins to hatch a plan. He says he just happens to know a renowned art therapist, who might be available but is very expensive. At the mention of pricey exclusivity, Yeon-kyo begs for an introduction. And this is how Ki-woo\u2019s sister, Ki-jung, comes to work in the Park household, posing as an elite art tutor for children.\n\nOver time, the children create jobs for their parents, too. They push out the Parks\u2019 Mercedes-Benz driver and install their father, Ki-taek, in his place. Then, in an even bolder act, they lead Yeon-kyo to believe that the housekeeper, Moon-gwang, is a threat to the children of the family, so that she, too, will be fired. Ki-woo\u2019s mother, Chung-sook, soon steps into the vacant job. By the midpoint of the film, all four members of Ki-woo\u2019s family are working for the Parks. Their employers have no idea that they are all related, or even previously connected. At night, the family retreats to their basement apartment and howls over their good fortune; in scamming the Parks, they have grown closer than ever. Up to this point, Parasite is essentially a feel-good film.", "description": "Bong Joon-ho\u2019s shapeshifting new film is a thriller about global inequality and resentment.", "authors": ["Rachel Syme"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/0ceb069519c946031fcb403d3e55a728546b65a3.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
