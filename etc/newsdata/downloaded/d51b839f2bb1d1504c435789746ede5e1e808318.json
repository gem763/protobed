In the NBA, his contract\u2019s worth about as much as that of a six-team, five-point-per-game journeyman.\n\nPut another way: the marquee running back for America\u2019s Team is guaranteed to make about as much as the second baseman for a last-place baseball team.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLet\u2019s set the stage. Elliott\u2019s new deal, for six years and $90 million, doesn\u2019t begin until after the 2020 season. While the specific payout structure hasn\u2019t yet been spelled out, we can work with the basics: the deal will be worth an average of $15 million a year, with $50 million of that guaranteed.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it here.]\n\nBonuses and other escalators will likely shape that figure, but we\u2019re not accountants here, we\u2019re painting in broad strokes. (And yes, there is an \u201capples-to-oranges\u201d line to consider: there are myriad considerations that affect paychecks, from the size of rosters, to the relative contributions to team success, to the percentage of salary cap, to the length of a season, to the length of careers. Even so, we\u2019re focusing exclusively on individual paychecks across sports. That\u2019s it. All salary figures via Spotrac.)\n\nA pro baller's life is good for the bank account. (AP)\n\nElliott\u2019s contract, which rode in on BREAKING NEWS alerts across the country Wednesday morning, is a perfect illustration of the immense salary disparity between the NFL\u2019s top stars and those of the NBA and MLB. No offense intended to contract equivalents like Miles Plumlee of the Memphis Grizzlies or Dee Gordon of the Seattle Mariners, both of whom are getting paid quite handsomely for their respective efforts. But Elliott\u2019s contract \u2014 the richest in Cowboys history, the richest ever for a running back \u2014 doesn\u2019t even crack the NBA\u2019s top 100 by some measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nSwitch to baseball, and we get one of sports\u2019 little ironies: Elliott\u2019s contract lines up with that of Giants pitcher Jeff Samardzjia \u2014 who switched sports away from football and now plays on a five-year, $90 million contract that, in pure numbers, equals Elliott\u2019s \u2026 and still ranks \u201conly\u201d 47th in baseball.\n\nOf course, the vast gap between a stated contract value and the actual guaranteed money is an NFL hallmark. Big numbers play well in the media, but don\u2019t necessarily make their way into a player\u2019s bank account, a fact worth keeping in mind when assessing lines like \u201cbiggest contract ever given to a Cowboy.\u201d\n\nElliott\u2019s $50 million guarantee puts him in the same boat as Plumlee, who\u2019s the 20th highest paid center in the NBA and the 91st highest paid player overall. If we go with the $15 million average, Elliott will be pulling down the same salary as Memphis\u2019s Jonas Valanciunas, Phoenix\u2019s Kelly Oubre Jr., the Lakers\u2019 Danny Green and the Knicks\u2019 Marcus Morris and Bobby Portis.\n\nLike most NBA contracts, baseball contracts are also guaranteed, meaning a $90 million deal is truly worth $90 million. If we drop back to just guarantees, Elliott\u2019s $15 million-per contract is the equivalent of the 89th best in baseball, ranking even with Gordon, Philly\u2019s Andrew McCutchen and Tampa Bay\u2019s Blake Snell.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Elliott is playing a devalued position. Although he\u2019s the highest-paid running back in the league, his average salary ranks 55th in the NFL, tied with Jacksonville\u2019s Calais Campbell and Washington\u2019s Josh Norman. His total contract ranks 21st in the league, even with Cleveland\u2019s Odell Beckham Jr. and Detroit\u2019s Trey Flowers.\n\nLook across sports, though, and the math starts to favor Elliott a touch more:\n\nIn golf, his $15 million deal would make him the Tour\u2019s money leader, more than $5 million ahead of leader Brooks Koepka. (Rory McIlroy did pocket Elliott\u2019s entire annual salary for winning just one tournament \u2014 the Tour Championship \u2014 last month, though.)\n\nIn the English Premier League, Elliott\u2019s salary would rank him eighth overall, ahead of notables like Harry Kane and Mo Salah. His average is double the highest-paid player in MLS, the LA Galaxy\u2019s Zlatan Ibrahimovic.\n\nIn the WNBA, Elliott\u2019s $15 million average is more than the payroll of literally every single team in the league combined.\n\nSo yes, in pure money terms, as vast as his new deal is, it\u2019s clear Elliott\u2019s not getting paid equivalent value relative to the wealth and popularity of his league. But hey, it could be worse. He could still be playing for free in college.\n\n____\n\nJay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
