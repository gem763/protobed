Bush\u2019s first administration, have already tried Cy Young winners. Twenty-game winners. Homegrown phenoms. And aging journeymen.\n\nWhy not let an Uber driver have a shot at ending their major-league record 14-game postseason losing streak, culminating in one of the wildest, zaniest and improbable weeks of any player in baseball?\n\n'Greatest week of my life'\n\nLet\u2019s see, he started and won the Twins\u2019 AL Central Division clinching game on Sept. 26 against the Detroit Tigers. He got married four days later in Maryland. And now he\u2019s pitching a playoff game at Yankee Stadium.\n\n\u201cThis has been the greatest week of my life,\u2019\u2019 Dobnak says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get any better than this.\u2019\u2019\n\nYes, even better than that fare two years ago in downtown Pittsburgh when he dropped off a woman with two kids at a Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 football game, and discovered that she tipped him $100.\n\n\u201cI got to the light, reached out to the cup holder, and \u201cHoly [smokes], it was $100. I tried to figure out who it was to message her, but I never figured it out.\n\n\u201cI hate people that don\u2019t tip. It sucks. The pizza delivery guys, if you think about it, they always get tipped. I\u2019m driving you around, using my gas, using my car, whatever\u2026.\n\n\u201cI tip everybody now when I use Uber, unless it\u2019s a really bad driver. Come on, it\u2019s good karma too.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd he\u2019d still like to know who the idiot was who ruined that don\u2019t give him a 5.0 rating too, with one unknown person giving him a 4-star rating to ruin his perfect store.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I did wrong, or if it was a mistake,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cbut that was the only person who didn\u2019t give me a 5-rating.\u2019\u2019\n\nDobnak made nine appearances for the Twins in the regular season. (Photo: Jeffrey Becker, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIn the world of baseball where the rating system is 20 to 80, and you\u2019re undrafted after pitching at Alderson Broaddus University, a tiny Division II school in West Virginia, wind up pitching for the Utica Unicorns in the four-team independent United Shore Professional Baseball League in Michigan, Dobnak barely registered on the rating scale.\n\nTwins veteran scout Billy Milos wound up discovering him in 2017, hearing about him from Jim Essian, the former Cubs\u2019 major-league manager who was managing Dobnak\u2019s independent league team. Milos never scouted him in person, but watched video on YouTube, before recommending the Twins sign him.\n\n\u201cI searched the entire internet,\u2019\u2019 Milos told USA TODAY Sports on Saturday morning. \u201cCome on, where do you get film on a guy from Alderson Broaddus? Whoever heard of that school?\n\n\u201cI mean, look at him, he looks like an Uber driver. He looks like your accountant. But what he\u2019s done now, going through four different levels in one year to starting Game 2 of the playoffs. What he\u2019s done, it\u2019s nuts, man. This is the stuff you dream of. This never happens. Not even first-rounders. He\u2019s a freak.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Twins wound up signing Dobnak for $2,000, and after pitching well between his Uber shifts this spring, wound up breaking camp with the Twins\u2019 Class A team in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n\n\u201cIf everything went right,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cI was hoping to maybe make it to Class AA (Pensacola) by the end of the year.\u2019\u2019\n\nDobnak paused, broke into a grin, and said, \u201cBut this year has been insane.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe soared through every level of the Twins\u2019 system, was called up to the big leagues on Aug. 9, pitched four times in relief, earned a spot in the starting rotation, made his first start at Fenway Park, and now is makes postseason debut in front of a frenzied crowd at Yankee Stadium.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it sunk in yet,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it ever will. I think everything that\u2019s happened to me is something I never would have thought of.\u2019\u2019\n\nWell, if it did, he certainly wouldn\u2019t have scheduled his wedding last weekend.\n\nHe and his fianc\u00e9e, Aerial, figured the timing was perfect. The minor league baseball season is over. The weather\u2019s great that time of year in Maryland. And all of his baseball buddies from the minor leagues could attend.\n\nWho\u2019d ever imagine that three days after clinching the AL Central with Dobnak pitching a one-hitter over six innings against the Tigers, he\u2019d be wearing those same celebratory goggles at his wedding reception with the maid of honor ending her speech by yelling out, \u201cGo Twins!\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cI still got \u2018em, never washed \u2018em,\u2019\u2019 Dobnak says of the goggles. \u201cStill have all of that good stuff in them.\u2019\u2019\n\nWho knows, maybe he\u2019ll break them out if he decides to go behind the wheel again this winter, driving Uber, just as he did when he showed up to spring training two months early, worked out in the mornings, and drove from 2 p.m. to 9 pm., and all day on Sundays.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see, it\u2019s something I like to do with my free time,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cReally, it\u2019s the second perfect job for baseball guys. It\u2019s your own hours. You work when you want to work. You drive when you want to drive, no obligations. It\u2019s really fun. Every ride is different.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe never picked up any of his future Twins\u2019 teammates, but with the Boston Red Sox also training in Fort Myers, it\u2019s quite possible he picked up some ballplayers.\n\n\u201cWell, not Mookie Betts,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cI would have known if Mookie Betts got in my car. He probably would have ordered an Uber Lux though.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd when his new teammates in spring training learned what he did for a living, he did give them a break, permitting them to simply text him for rides, particularly for late-night pizza and Chick-fil-A deliveries.\n\nHey, what\u2019s a buddy for, right?\n\n'He won't be intimidated'\n\nNow, with all of the minor leaguers he left behind in spring training, with only one Twins\u2019 player from the 2017 draft even making it past Class AA, they\u2019ll all be watching Dobnak make one of the most stunning starts in Twins\u2019 history.\n\nThis will be only the fourth traditional start of his major-league career \u2013 with two other starts being used as an opener \u2013 going 2-1 with a 1.59 ERA in 28 \u2153 innings over nine appearances since his call-up.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how he\u2019ll do,\u2019\u2019 said Milos, who also discovered 29-year-old Tampa Bay Rays rookie Nick Anderson in independent ball, \u201cbut I know he won\u2019t be intimidated or scared. He won\u2019t even hear those fans. He just has that makeup that\u2019s different than all these other dudes. Nothing bothers this kid. You never know if he got his ass kicked or pitched a one-hitter. He was just born like this.\"\n\nWhile several of Dobnak\u2019s teammates conceded they felt pressure pitching in New York in Game 1, Dobnak is practically begging the Yankee Stadium crowd to be as raucous and rowdy as possible. Bring on the noise.\n\n\u201cThe louder they are,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u201cthe more I love it. I can block it out. I\u2019ve been doing it all year. I\u2019ve been trying to simplify the game my whole life, and to do that, I\u2019ve always been able to keep calm. I won\u2019t let my emotions get to me.\"\n\nNow, he\u2019ll be pitching in front of the biggest crowd of his life, leaving eight tickets to his wife, parents, in-laws, agent, and wife\u2019s friend who happens to be a Yankee fan.\n\n\u201cBut not tonight,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nDobnak, who 10 days ago wasn\u2019t even guaranteed a spot on the playoff roster, was chosen to pitch for his ability to keep the ball down, with a 52.9% groundball rate. He\u2019ll throw 90-96 mph, mix in an array of sliders, and try to keep the baseball in the ballpark facing the most intimidating lineup he has ever faced. The Bronx Bombers hit 306 home runs this season, but Dobnak has given up only one in his big-league career.\n\n\u201cI have confidence,\u2019\u2019 says Dobnak, who wears white glasses while he pitches. \u201cI believe in myself. I\u2019m going to be the same person I\u2019m always going to be.\"\n\nOh, and when the Twins depart New York after the game, he has to remind himself to take a souvenir.\n\nHe forgot to collect anything from Fenway Park, but this time, he can\u2019t leave New York empty-handed.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u201cI\u2019ll just steal something.\u2019\u2019\n\nA Twins\u2019 victory ending a 15-year drought will do for starters.", "description": "In one of baseball's most inspiring stories, Twins rookie Randy Dobnak will start Game 2 of the ALDS against the New York Yankees.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
