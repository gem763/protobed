It remains unclear if that was an accident.\n\nLabor frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon went off message in 2013, mocking the Gillard government's attempts at media management and rote reading lines on poor poll results on live TV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most revealing sections of Monday's mistake are listed under the heading \"If asked\".\n\n\"If asked: calls for a national drought policy\", explain the government's response is strategic.\n\n\"If asked about worker exploitation\", stress zero tolerance.\n\n\"If asked could you live [on] $40 a day,\" say anything but yes.\n\nIf asked about the International Monetary Fund's expectations that Australia will miss its 2030 climate targets, MPs are told to say Australia will meet its commitments without a carbon tax.\n\nThe talking points don't say how Australia's rising carbon emissions might complicate matters. More detail is included in the section titled \"LABOR'S TAXES\".\n\nFacing criticism from the opposition over asylum claims by people arriving in Australia by air rather than boat, Mr Morrison's office blames Labor for the problem and says claims fell by 12 per cent.\n\nIllustrative of much of the rot in modern political communication, the release of the talking points challenge journalists to call out spin in every interview they conduct on Monday.\n\nAttorney-General Christian Porter downplayed the blunder on ABC radio.\n\n\"I didn't know that they were [distributed],\" he said. These things happen from time to time.\"", "description": "Some 18 pages of approved media messages for Liberal and National MPs were sent to the press gallery on Monday morning.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1576%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_16/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3405c8f302e8897a998368e0808a52a335807c7c", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
