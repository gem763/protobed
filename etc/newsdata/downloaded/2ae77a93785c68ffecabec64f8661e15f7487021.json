And it happens,\u2019 Mitchell says of wardrobe malfunctions on movie sets.\n\n\u2018The first take of the first shot that we did of Jennifer coming out for her entrance, two of the strings popped off her body. So I ran in with my team, there was about four of us stitching her back into this costume on the stage because we just knew it\u2019s not something that we could risk and so we had to completely sew her into that bodysuit that you see on camera,\u2019 Mitchell revealed.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nHe quipped: \u2018There\u2019s really not a ton of coverage so there\u2019s more double stick tape involved in that movie probably more than any other movie.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the nature of the movie \u2013 women dancing in strip clubs wearing very little clothing \u2013 Mitchell made it a priority to design outfits which the cast were comfortable with.\n\nHe explained: \u2018Obviously, there is a level of nudity in the movie that requires some confidence building and understanding what the women prefer about their bodies or areas that they\u2019re not as confident in.\n\n\u2018We just really tried to work with them in the privacy of their trailer and in the fitting room so that we could understand the movement that they were going to do with change the costume and make sure that everybody felt comfortable with the level of coverage or nudity depending on the scene.\u2019\n\nThroughout the film, we see Jennifer in an array of skimpy outfits from lace to feather and everything in between.\n\n\u2018Jennifer wears a lot of bold looks in the film and they needed to behave in different ways,\u2019 the designer explained.\n\n\u2018Some of them on the pole, some of them in the champagne room, some in the locker room. So for me, it was just an understanding of the differences in lighting between all of those setups, and also the differences in terms of where the Ramona character was in the evolution of her story.\n\nRamona and Destiny\u2019s style couldn\u2019t have been more different (Picture: Capital Pictures)\n\nMitchell worked his magic on the Hustlers costumes (Picture: STX Films)\n\n\u2018Of course I\u2019m no fool, I read the script and I understand that Jennifer is going to be introduced to the audience in this extremely provocative way and in a way that we\u2019ve never seen Jennifer before.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMitchell recalls how he broke the ice with the cast by heading to strip clubs before production even began so he could get an idea of the looks he wanted to create for the characters.\n\nHe revealed: \u2018We were patrons and we tried to understand as much about the culture as we could, and really immerse ourselves into the lifestyle and into the community so that we could portray their lives accurately, it was always important to us that this didn\u2019t become \u2013 there was no judgment in our portrayal of these women.\u2019\n\nMitchell joked that while it\u2019s not the \u2018traditional process\u2019 of bonding with your new colleagues, it \u2018definitely made for fast friendships\u2019.\n\n\u2018It was really a bonding experience for so many of us. And ultimately, listen, I\u2019m not the average patron at a strip club,\u2019 he recalled fondly.\n\n\u2018But I immediately found so much common ground with the with the women working there, and they were so giving of their time and their stories.\n\nCardi B was a \u2018delight\u2019 thanks to her knowledge of strippers (Picture: STK Films)\n\n\u2018The women that I worked with were, were really interested in being portrayed in the more complex light than I think film has traditionally treated the exotic dancer or stripper or sex worker.\u2019\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Cardi B.\n\nBefore the glitz and glam of the rap scene, the Bodak Yellow rapper made her living as a stripper in New York.\n\nSo who better than Cardi to turn to for advice on that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Cardi was a complete delight for me, she was a total surprise and that she was really ready to take this on as an actress and not as a global superstar in the way that we\u2019ve come to know her,\u2019 Mitchell revealed.\n\n\u2018I asked her as much as I could. I told her I wanted to get her into that mindset about the Cardi before we got to know her, and what she was like in the clubs.\n\n\u2018We had a lot of conversations about how her life has changed and how we could help get her back into that frame of mind.\n\n\u2018Her insight was actually quite important to me in terms of costume design for this film.\u2019\n\nSounds like quite the experience.\n\nHustlers is out in cinemas now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
