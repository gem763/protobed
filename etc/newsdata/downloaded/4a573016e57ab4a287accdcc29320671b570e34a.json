Those leading the talks hope the Labour Party can be convinced to participate.\n\nSources involved in efforts to build a Remain alliance say around twenty Labour MPs privately support the idea.\n\nAt Labour's conference in Brighton last week, shadow Treasury minister MP Clive Lewis became the first to publicly back a Remain alliance, saying that standing aside for anti-Brexit candidates was a \"no-brainer.\"\n\n\"At present it's the central Labour party that decides that a candidate will be stood in every single constituency, it's part of our constitution,\" the Labour MP for Norwich South told party members.\n\nHe added: \"[But] I think we should trust in our local Labour members to know what's happening on the ground to be able to make a decision about whether they want to stand a candidate.\"\n\nNow another Labour MP, Rosie Duffield, has joined the call for the party to work as part of a pro-European alliance.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Business Insider, she said: \"Labour shouldn't be scared of electoral pacts with parties who want to stop Brexit.\n\n\"It's a given that Labour will have to stand aside in some seats to let the other progressive parties claim a victory.\n\nShe added: \"That's the only way we're going to prevent Boris Johnson and his cabal of Brexit zealots securing a majority at the next election \u2014 by working together.\n\n\"Our party will never be forgiven if we put petty tribalism ahead of the national interest.\"\n\nAnti-Brexit activists believe only an electoral pact will stop Johnson\n\nRosie Duffield MP. Nicola Tree/Getty Images\n\nBoth Lewis and Duffield are supporters of the Best For Britain campaign to stay in the EU.\n\nBest For Britain analysis suggests there are 158 constituencies \u2014 around a quarter of House of Commons seats \u2014 where pro-EU parties working together could feasibly keep out Conservative candidates.\n\nSpeaking at Labour conference last week, Lewis pointed out that a Remain alliance would almost certainly have prevented Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith from winning in Richmond Park at the last election in 2017, for example.\n\nBest For Britain believes that with Prime Minister Johnson leading in the opinion polls, and Nigel Farage's Brexit Party set to stand aside for hard Brexiteer Conservative candidates at the next election, a pact involving opposition parties including Labour will likely be the only way of preventing a Johnson victory.\n\nThe group has identified 158 seats in its analysis, where smaller parties would need to step aside for Labour in 110 of them to stop the pro-EU vote splintering. In the rest, Labour would have to back a smaller opposition party.\n\nThe Labour leadership is currently opposed to working together with other parties at the next election.\n\nShadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry last week told Business Insider she was wholly against it.\n\nFurthermore, while a majority of Labour members and MPs support remaining in the EU, and Labour policy is to hold a new referendum, the party is not yet committed to campaigning for Remain in a new public vote.\n\nCorbyn has said that as prime minister, he would negotiate a new Brexit deal, and then let party members decide whether party policy should be to go ahead with Brexit under the terms of that deal, or stay in the EU.", "description": "Exclusive: Labour MP Rosie Duffield joins a growing number of MPs calling for the party to join a Remain alliance at the next general election.", "authors": ["Adam Payne"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8df9b52e22af163f1cb3d2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
