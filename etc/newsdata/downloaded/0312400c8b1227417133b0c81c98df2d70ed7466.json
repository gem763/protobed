In November, prosecutors said he was under investigation and was barred from leaving the kingdom.\n\nThe former royal adviser has also been accused by activists of being involved in the alleged torture of a jailed women's rights activist in the country.\n\nCNN has attempted to reach the Saudi government for comment. When asked for more details on why the account had been suspended, a Twitter spokesperson referred CNN to the platform's rules on manipulation and spam\n\nTwitter TWTR announced it was also suspending six accounts linked to Saudi state media that represented themselves as independent but amplified \"messaging that was beneficial to the Saudi government.\"\n\nA separate network of 267 accounts originating in the United Arab Emirates and Egypt were also suspended.
