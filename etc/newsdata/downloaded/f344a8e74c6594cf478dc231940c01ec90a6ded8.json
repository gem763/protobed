(John Woods/The Canadian Press via AP, File)\n\nWide receiver Antonio Brown has instructed the Oakland Raiders via social media to release him.\n\nThe move comes one day after the team opted not to suspend or release him for a midweek practice-field incident with General Manager Mike Mayock, with Coach Jon Gruden saying Friday that he plans on Brown playing Monday night against the Denver Broncos in the Raiders\u2019 regular season opener. But Brown was expected to be fined for that incident with Mayock and is facing the possibility of the guarantee of a portion of the money in his contract being revoked under the language of the deal.\n\nBrown ended an Instagram post by telling the Raiders to \u201cRelease me,\u201d followed by \u201c#NOMore.\u201d\n\nIn the Instagram post, Brown also wrote: \u201cYou are gonna p--s a lot of people off when you start doing what\u2019s best for you.\u201d\n\nHe wrote: \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine! I have worked my whole life to prove that the system is blind to see talent like [mine]. Now that everyone sees is, they want me to conform to that same system that has failed me all those years. \u2018I\u2019m not mad at anyone. I\u2019m just asking for the freedom to prove them all wrong.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s demand appears related to the possibility that a portion of the guarantees in his contract could be voided, based on his conduct and the language in his deal.\n\nHe signed a three-year, $50.1 million contract with the Raiders in conjunction with the offseason trade in which the team acquired him from the Pittsburgh Steelers. The deal contained $30.1 million in guaranteed money, $1 million of which was tied to a bonus and the remaining $29.1 million of which is tied to his salaries of $14.625 million this season and $14.5 million for the 2020 season.\n\nThe contract language gives the Raiders, they believe, the ability to void the guarantee of the remaining $29.1 million, making those salaries non-guaranteed, based on misconduct by Brown. That ability to revoke the guarantees probably was triggered, in the Raiders\u2019 thinking, even before Wednesday\u2019s verbal confrontation with Mayock, according to several people familiar with the situation. The team notified Brown that he was being fined nearly $54,000 for missing a walk-through and a day of training camp last month.\n\nHowever, Brown\u2019s $14.625 million salary for the 2019 season would become re-guaranteed, in effect, if he\u2019s on the Raiders\u2019 roster Monday, given the league\u2019s system for termination pay, which was confirmed by a person familiar with the situation. So if Brown is on the roster Monday, all that would be at stake is the guarantee of his 2020 salary.\n\nThrough the NFL Players Association, Brown could challenge an attempt by the Raiders to revoke the guarantee of money in his contract.\n\nBrown also is reported to be unhappy about being fined for Wednesday\u2019s incident with Mayock. Multiple people familiar with the situation said Friday night that Brown was expected to be fined for the episode. The amount of the fine was unclear. Under the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the NFLPA, the Raiders could fine Brown as much as one game check for conduct detrimental to the team. In Brown\u2019s case, that is just more than $860,000, or one-seventeenth of this season\u2019s salary.\n\nBrown could, if he chooses, appeal the fine through the union.\n\n[From Steelers subtweets to a demand for release: The Antonio Brown saga, explained]\n\nThe Raiders chose not to suspend Brown for conduct detrimental to the team. Under the CBA, a club can suspend a player as many as four games without pay. But when Brown returned to practice Friday after being told to stay home Thursday, Gruden told reporters that the plan was for Brown to play Monday night.\n\nBrown apologized to fellow Raiders players in a team meeting Friday and later said during a brief meeting with reporters: \u201cI\u2019m excited to be out here today. I apologized to my teammates [and] the organization. Enough talk, man. I\u2019m excited to be out here with my teammates. I\u2019m grateful for all the fans. I\u2019m excited to be a part of the Raiders and see you guys soon.\u201d\n\nLater Friday, Brown released a YouTube video containing, it appeared, a phone conversation that he\u2019d had with Gruden. In the conversation, Gruden asked Brown if he wanted to be a Raider and Brown replied that the issue was whether the team wanted him to be a Raider. Gruden told Brown to cease his off-field antics and just play football.\n\nThe incident with Mayock came after Brown posted to social media a copy of the letter from the GM informing him of the $54,000 in fines. According to reports, Brown used disparaging language during Wednesday\u2019s incident and threatened to punch Mayock but the confrontation did not become physical. Brown reportedly also punted a football and told Mayock to fine him for that.\n\nThe Raiders told Brown to stay home Thursday and he complied, missing that day\u2019s practice. But his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, said he was working to repair Brown\u2019s relationship with the team. Rosenhaus\u2019s voice could be heard on the audio of the phone conversation with Gruden in the YouTube video.\n\nTeam officials mulled the possibility of suspending or releasing Brown after Wednesday\u2019s incident, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations, but decided against it. Brown was a seven-time Pro Bowl selection while with the Steelers and the Raiders are eager to try to win in the second season of Gruden\u2019s return to coaching after he left ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d broadcast booth. The team hired Mayock, a former draft analyst for NFL Network, as GM, but Gruden is believed to have the final say over major player-related decisions.\n\nBrown missed practice time during training camp and the preseason after suffering injuries to his feet, reportedly while undergoing cryotherapy treatments, and while fighting the NFL with two failed grievances in which he sought to allow to be wear a helmet not up to the league\u2019s safety standards.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nNFL players increasingly want to use their leverage, and realize how little they have\n\nSaints-Rams lawsuit brought by fan dismissed by Louisiana Supreme Court\n\nTyreek Hill, Chiefs agree to contract extension after tumultuous offseason", "description": "Wide receiver\u2019s Saturday morning Instagram post is the latest episode in his turbulent training camp and preseason.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl", "September At Am", "Mark Maske Covers The Nfl For The Washington Post.
