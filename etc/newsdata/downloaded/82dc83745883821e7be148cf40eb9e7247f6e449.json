REUTERS/James Akena/File Photo\n\nWine, 37, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has rattled the government since becoming a legislator in 2017 with a line in caustic criticism that has earned him growing support.\n\nHis rising political ambitions and connection with young people via his music have provoked a clamp-down by the government, which has detained some of his supporters and teargassed his rallies.\n\nJoel Senyonyi, spokesman for Wine\u2019s People Power movement, told Reuters the youths were detained in Kabalagala, a suburb in the south of the capital Kampala where they were holding a news conference to denounce the government\u2019s red beret ban.\n\n\u201cThe youths were emphasising that we commit no offence when we wear these berets,\u201d Senyonyi said, adding that police stormed the event and detained the six while others fled.\n\n\u201cThe beret, it\u2019s our symbol. When we wear those berets we identify not just with People Power but with the cause for a better Uganda,\u201d he said.\n\nWine and supporters of the People Power movement that he hopes will help him unseat veteran leader Yoweri Museveni at the next presidential election have been wearing red berets and other items of red clothing including shirts and overalls.\n\nLast month however the government banned civilian use of red berets, describing them and other pieces of military wear as \u201cproperty of the state\u201d.\n\nCivilians found wearing or selling them, the government warned, would be prosecuted under military law, which can mean a life sentence.
