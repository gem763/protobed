As a result, many former members of the Rajapaksa government accused of corruption who opposed the policies of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe alliance joined the Cabinet and began to have a bigger say in the government.\n\nInstead of abolishing the presidential system, Sirisena only diluted its powers. Under pressure from the Rajapaksa camp he announced that he would not allow any government soldiers to be punished for alleged war abuses, despite having promised the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate and prosecute suspects.\n\nHis party delayed presenting its views on a new constitution to share power with Tamils, and the process has now stagnated in Parliament. The administration also failed to punish members of the Rajapaksa family for alleged wrongdoing.\n\nIn the meantime, Rajapaksa formed a breakaway party and with his popularity from ending the civil war won over a majority of Sirisena\u2019s supporters, weakening the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.\n\nHis relationship with Wickremesinghe also turned sour with a tussle for power and exploded last year when Sirisena sacked Wickremesinghe and appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa in his place, seemingly in the hope of securing his support for reelection.\n\nA court decision restored Wickremesinghe, and Rajapaksa has not given Sirisena the expected support and instead fielded his brother as a presidential candidate.\n\nSirisena\u2019s failure to prevent suicide bomb attacks on Easter Sunday triggered public anger against him. The suicide blasts, blamed on two local groups inspired by the Islamic State group, killed more than 260 people at three churches and three hotels.\n\nSirisena\u2019s presidency, however, has probably been the best for freedom of the media and speech. Trade union and student activism have been at their peak.\n\n\u201cWe elected Maithripala Sirisena with so much hope, and now feel so cheated by him,\u201d said Nalaka Gunawardene, a media analyst.\n\n\u201cHe missed a historic chance to heal our divided society and instead deepened its polarization,\u201d he said. \u201cHe did end the Rajapaksa era authoritarianism and restored our freedoms, but these alone cannot redeem him.\u201d\n\nThough Sirisena\u2019s political future looks bleak, he is holding talks with the Rajapaksas in the hope of gaining a political position in exchange for the votes of his supporters.\n\nHe told a recent public meeting that his focus is not on the presidency, but on being a force in a powerful government.\n\nThe 35 candidates for the presidency are the most ever in Sri Lanka, after 22 candidates in 2010.\n\nRajapaksa said after filing his nomination that he is confident of winning.\n\nHis main rival is Sajith Premadasa from the governing coalition. He is a son of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who was assassinated in 1993 by the Tamil Tiger rebels.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely confident that the vast majority of the Sri Lankans of all ethnic backgrounds irrespective of cast and creed will support this monumental, path-breaking program that will make our country prosperous,\u201d Premadasa said. \u201cWe shall embark on a democratic political program ensuring that the rights of all citizens are protected.\u201d\n\nAlso among the candidates are two Buddhist monks, four people from the predominantly Buddhist country\u2019s Muslim minority and two Tamils. There is one female candidate.\n\nIt is likely that the Muslim and Tamil candidates will attract protest votes against the main parties, which are led by ethnic Sinhalese.\n\nTamils are displeased that Sirisena\u2019s government failed to deliver on promised power-sharing arrangements and answers to families whose relatives went missing in the civil war.\n\nMuslims are unhappy that the government failed to stop the persecution of Muslims after the Easter Sunday bombings.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena has decided not to seek reelection next month", "authors": ["Krishan Francis"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/sri_lanka_maithripala_sirisena_election.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
