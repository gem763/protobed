In exchange, Beijing will make as much as $50 billion of agricultural purchases and also take steps on intellectual property, financial services and the yuan.\n\n\u201cMy deal with China is that they will IMMEDIATELY start buying very large quantities of our Agricultural Product, not wait until the deal is signed over the next 3 or 4 weeks.
