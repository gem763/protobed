Their income is not reliable. Their health and welfare standards are incredibly low. They\u2019re at the whim of these companies that dictate the terms of their work.\u201d\n\nThe law the coalition is seeking would apply to Uber and Lyft drivers, and also to nail salon workers and bike delivery workers for Door Dash.\n\n\u201cOur approach is really saying it\u2019s got to be universal standards,\u201d said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, another coalition member. Other members include the New York Nail Salon Workers Association, the Legal Aid Society, Make the Road New York, an affiliate of SEIU and the National Employment Law Project.\n\nThe proposed law would call for a three-part test to determine if in fact a worker is an employee. The so-called \u201cABC test\u201d would find a worker an independent contractor, not an employee, if the worker is \u201cfree from control and direction in how they operate in their day to day job;\u201d \u201cperforming services that are outside an employer\u2019s usual course of business;\u201d and \u201cengaging in an independent trade.\u201d\n\nCalifornia is in the process of passing a similar bill, an effort that has sparked a firestorm among tech-sector players. Uber, Lyft and Door Dash have vowed to spend up to $90 million fighting the effort.\n\nSpokespeople for Uber and Lyft had no immediate comment. Nor did spokespeople for the New York State Senate. A spokesperson for Gov. Andrew Cuomo had no immediate comment.", "description": "The law the coalition is seeking would apply to Uber and Lyft drivers, and also to nail salon workers and bike delivery workers for Door Dash.", "authors": ["Dana Rubinstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8c/17/453754584a9181573d1393e81301/181023-uber-gty-900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
