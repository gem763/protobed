For that reason the identity of the whistleblower is irrelevant.\"\n\nBut Republicans have challenged that claim, noting that various statements in the whistleblower claim have seemingly proved inaccurate. For example, the whistleblower complaint stated that President Trump made a \u201cspecific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike\" -- a request that does not appear in the declassified transcript of the call released by the Trump administration. Trump mentioned CrowdStrike, but did not demand the server.\n\nTRUMP SUGGESTS SCHIFF 'HELPED WRITE' WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, AFTER SCHIFF CHANGES TUNE ON COMMUNICATIONS WITH WHISTLEBLOWER\n\nAnd according to the whistleblower complaint, by mid-May, U.S. diplomat Kurt Volker sought to \"contain the damage\" from Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's outreach to Ukraine. But a July 19 text message conversation from Volker to Giuliani, provided to Fox News, showed that Volker had in fact encouraged Giuliani to reach out to Ukraine -- even sending Giuliani a message reading, \"Connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky.\"\n\nAdditionally, details concerning Zaid's overt political advocacy have surfaced as he represents the anonymous whistleblower publicly.\n\nAlthough the lawyer has described Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., as a \"mature professional,\" and circulated articles that touted the reliability of the largely discredited Steele dossier used by the FBI to surveil a former member of Trump's campaign, Zaid has repeatedly unloaded on the president in no uncertain terms.\n\n\"I'm not a Trump fan,\" Zaid said on a podcast last year. \"I go out of my way on Twitter to say '#Resistance.' It's not a resistance against the GOP or a Republican -- I don't think [Trump] is a Republican, quite frankly.\" (Zaid also boasted that he has sued \"every\" president since 1993, and pursues \"them all,\" regardless of party affiliation.)\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER CHECKED FORM INDICATING 'FIRSTHAND' KNOWLEDGE -- CONTRARY TO CONGRESSIONAL DOCS\n\nAlso in the podcast, Zaid acknowledged that he had been fishing for plaintiffs to launch a lawsuit concerning the Trump hotel in Washington, D.C., alleging unfair competition by the president and his associates.\n\n\"The unfair competition becomes, when Donald Trump became president, he has exploited his use of the presidency, of the Oval Office. ... to send business to the hotel. ... We identified this as a cause of action, and we were looking for a plaintiff, and we finally found this one restaurant that was willing,\" Zaid admitted. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit last year.\n\nZaid also said Trump supporters \"out in the heartland\" were \"so narrow-minded\" because they did not understand his concerns were nonpartisan.\n\nAnd Zaid put out something of an open casting call for whistleblowers on Twitter as Trump took office, writing that CIA employees should \"come to\" his law firm \"to lawfully challenge\" the new president.\n\nZaid also publicly requested celebrities Debra Messing, Nancy Sinatra, Cher and Rob Reiner to promote his whistleblower law firm.\n\nWHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES IT WILL NOT COMPLY WITH 'ILLEGITIMATE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\n\"@cher please check out our new whistleblower page,\" Zaid wrote in one tweet, which garnered no response from the famed singer.\n\nIn February, Zaid escalated his pitch to Reiner, asserting that \"we have a chance to depose\" Trump in court.\n\nAt one point last year, Zaid even pitched his services to Michael Avenatti, after the now-embattled attorney mentioned that he was \"now representing whistleblowers within ICE.\"\n\nAdditionally, Zaid openly encouraged individuals to apply to the CIA so that they could become his clients when they discovered \"waste, fraud, abuse or unlawful conduct.\"\n\n'60 MINUTES' TOTALLY MISREPRESENTED THE FACTS, WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY SAYS\n\nFox News has learned that Whistleblower Aid -- the nonprofit where Zaid is a founding partner and that established a GoFundMe that has raised more than $200,000 for the whistleblower's legal team -- is also known as Values United. Tax documents filed by Valued United show that the organization paid West End Strategy Group $258,085 for advertising and consulting services.\n\nWest End Strategy founder Matt Dorf says on that group's website that he \"influences progressive politics, skillfully shifting the conversation to achieve the goals of West End Strategy clients.\"\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump pressed for the whistleblower to be \u201cexposed and questioned\u201d after new reports surfaced suggesting the person has ties to a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe Whistleblower\u2019s facts have been so incorrect about my \u2018no pressure\u2019 conversation with the Ukrainian President, and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a Democrat Candidate, that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cThis is no Whistleblower\u2026.The Whistleblower\u2019s lawyer is a big Democrat. The Whistleblower has ties to one of my DEMOCRAT OPPONENTS. Why does the [Intelligence Community Inspector General] allow this scam to continue?\u201d\n\nOn Friday sources told Fox News that Atkinson revealed the whistleblower volunteered that he or she was a registered Democrat and had a prior working relationship with a prominent Democratic politician.\n\nZaid has confirmed this past week that there is a second whistleblower who has come forward and has already spoken to the inspector general.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe whistleblower, whose identity remains secret, originally alerted the inspector general to a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump sought investigations into possible Ukraine actions in the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s conduct in relation to his own family\u2019s ties in the country. Fox News first reported that the whistleblower, after learning of the call, wrote a dramatic personal memo saying a White House official characterized the call as \u201ccrazy,\" \u201cfrightening,\" and \"completely lacking in substance related to national security.\"\n\nThe whistleblower complaint touched off a controversy that led to the White House releasing an account of the call, while Democrats immediately launched an impeachment inquiry. On Wednesday, Trump called the whistleblower's claims \"a very big Lie,\" and pointed to statements made by Zelensky that he felt no pressure.\n\n\"No Pressure at all said Ukraine! Very congenial, a perfect call. The Whistleblower and others spoke BEFORE seeing the Transcript,\" he tweeted. \"Now they must apologize to me and stop this ridiculous impeachment!\"\n\nFox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report.", "description": "Mark Zaid, one of the attorneys representing the whistleblower at the center of Democrats' impeachment inquiry, acknowledged in a statement on Wednesday that the whistleblower \"has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties\" -- but insisted that the contact involved the politicians' roles as \"elected officials \u2013 not as candidates.\"", "authors": ["Gregg Re", "Gregg Re Is A Lawyer", "Editor Based In Los Angeles.
