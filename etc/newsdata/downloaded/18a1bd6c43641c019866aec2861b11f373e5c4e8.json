I was put on the birth-control pill to restore fertility and whatnot. But it\u2019s a hard condition and I felt like I was never really given the full picture, which I think happens a lot, especially when you\u2019re just given these quick-fix \u201cband-aids\u201d for larger problems. For me, it was time to get off the birth-control pill, which wreaked havoc on my skin, hair, and moods for a couple of months. I\u2019m a big research person. That\u2019s one of my favorite things. If I weren\u2019t an actress, I feel like I would do really well in investigational research. So during my research phase, I wanted to try everything natural for my body. I wanted to get to know my body again in my own way. And Alisa Vitti was very crucial in that journey.\n\nI feel like with gynecology especially, it\u2019s been a very male-driven field. How does someone who has never had a period in their life empathize fully? This is not me going against male gynecologists, but this is me really saying, if you\u2019ve never had a period in your life, how do you know what it is? When I read this book, I felt like, oh holy hell, things I haven\u2019t been told! I think one of the most brilliant things I read in this book is about the various phases of your menstruation cycle. It\u2019s no longer, \u201cOh, I\u2019m PMSing.\u201d I don\u2019t even use that term anymore. I just say, \u201cI\u2019m in the luteal phase.\u201d And if someone doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, I tell them to buy this book. Every woman should know.", "description": "The 8 things actress Freida Pinto can\u2019t live without, including Headspace, Manduka yoga straps, Charlotte\u2019s Web CBD oil, Eminence facial recovery oil, Woman Code by Alisa Vitti, The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer, and Clarks desert boots.", "authors": ["Freida Pinto", "Chloe Anello"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/10/11/11-freida-pinto-wiclw.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
