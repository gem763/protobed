Mr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE NEW FOX NEWS POLL\n\nRecent Fox News polling finds that support for impeachment has shifted significantly. A poll conducted Sunday through Tuesday found 51 percent of Americans now say that the president should be impeached and removed from office in comparison to just 42 percent in July.\n\nHowever, President Trump told reporters on Wednesday that the fight might be taken all the way up to the Supreme Court if Republicans don't \"get a fair shake.\"\n\n\"On portions of this, he may well be right,\" Ray told Faulkner. \"There are issues about, for example, access to grand jury material. That particular issue is actually the subject of a pending partition before the United States Supreme Court that may result in the Supreme Court reviewing that issue.\"\n\n\"There are issues about the pendency of this impeachment inquiry and the efforts by the House of Representatives that may well land before the Supreme Court,\" he said.\n\nBut, when it would happen is a different story.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRay asked: \"Even if these things were actually dealt with on an emergency basis, you know you have to say to yourself well, 'How long would that take before there would actually be a decision in connection with those matters?'\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "House Democrats' legal position during their impeachment inquiry would be enhanced by a full vote on the House floor, former Whitewater Independent Counsel Robert Ray said Thursday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Dev_ENC1_132152014667730000.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
