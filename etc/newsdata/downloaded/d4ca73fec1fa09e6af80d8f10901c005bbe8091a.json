His political opponents later pilloried him for appeasing America\u2019s authoritarian enemies in seeking to constrain Iran\u2019s nuclear program and reconcile with Cuba.\n\nImagine the uproar if Obama had held a splashy summit with Kim Jong Un in return for no substantive concessions on North Korea\u2019s nuclear-weapons arsenal\u2014let alone if he had done that three times, as Trump has, including the first presidential foray into North Korean territory. What if Obama had gushed about how he \u201cfell in love\u201d with North Korea\u2019s dictator? Or unabashedly taken the totalitarian leader\u2019s side in disputes with a former American vice president and the president\u2019s own national security adviser? Or absolved Kim of responsibility for the death of an American college student in North Korean captivity? Or castigated the CIA for cultivating Kim\u2019s half brother as an intelligence asset? Or, while we\u2019re at it, saluted a North Korean general? (See: the various controversies surrounding Obama\u2019s bows to U.S. partners such as the Saudi king and Japanese emperor.)\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters tend to explain away this behavior as the unsavory means by which the president hopes to achieve a worthy objective: a nuclear deal with North Korea, which has eluded his predecessors. They note that Trump has held firm on severe North Korean sanctions. \u201cFor 30 years, they\u2019ve been trying to pound a round peg in a square hole,\u201d the Republican Senator James Risch once told me, regarding the history of U.S. talks with Pyongyang. \u201cThings need to be done differently.\u201d If nothing else, even as Trump has worked to erase nearly every aspect of Obama\u2019s foreign-policy record, the two presidents have fashioned a joint legacy: shattering the long-standing bipartisan American taboo of presidents directly engaging with their foes.", "description": "", "authors": ["Uri Friedman", "Theatlantic.Com Politics Archive Will-Gop-Split-Trump-Over-Foreign-Policy"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
