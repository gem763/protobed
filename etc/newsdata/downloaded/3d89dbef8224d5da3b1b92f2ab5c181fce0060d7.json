REUTERS/Mark Blinch\n\nM&A involving Canadian players totaled $49.7 billion (C$66.07 billion) in the three months to Sept. 30, the data showed, while IPOs raised $774 million in the quarter.\n\nDeals in the first three quarters of 2019 slid to $157 billion, the lowest level since 2014, compared with $200.6 billion for the corresponding period in 2018.\n\nTrade and economic uncertainties meant companies were \u201cless confident and therefore less interested in acting,\u201d said David Rawlings, Chief Executive Officer for Canada at JP Morgan Chase & Co, although he noted a high base for comparison.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve normalized from some really high activity a couple of years ago to a more normal run rate now,\u201d Rawlings told Reuters. He said activity over the next 12 to 18 months could remain fairly consistent with the levels so far this year.\n\nMost companies have healthy cash flow and balance sheets and access to financing, and investors are still active, Rawlings said.\n\nInvestment and private equity firms including Brookfield Asset Management (BAMa.TO), Blackstone Group (BX.N) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board were involved in four of the quarter\u2019s five biggest deals.\n\nTD Securities led financial advisors with $36.3 billion of M&A deals. Osler Hoskin & Harcourt topped legal advisors with deals worth $41.3 billion.\n\nA fall in cannabis deals also contributed to the decline in M&A activity.
