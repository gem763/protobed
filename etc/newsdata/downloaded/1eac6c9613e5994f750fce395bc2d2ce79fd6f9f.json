You can\u2019t let that stand.\u2019 But we don\u2019t know what he did.\u201d\n\nClinton also slammed \u201cRepublican defenders\u201d of Trump who argue the accusations made against him are \u201chearsay.\u201d\n\nGIULIANI WAS NOT WORKING ALONE IN BIDEN UKRAINE PROBE\n\n\u201cIt was an admission from the White House! I mean, the transcript of the phone call was put out by the White House. And the whistleblower has a depth of understanding that needs to be taken seriously about what happened,\u201d she said.\n\nColbert also asked the former Democratic presidential nominee on her thoughts about Trump \u201csending Rudy Giuliani out to handle foreign policy,\u201d referring to reports that Giuliani sought damaging information on Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden from Ukraine officials.\n\nClinton said \u201cThat would be a big problem\u201d if it had happened under President Obama.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cPresidents often use\u2014as do secretaries of state\u2014they might use an envoy or a special adviser to deliver a message,\u201d she said. \u201cBut again, it is supposed to be carefully thought through. And from what we\u2019ve seen on television, carefully thinking through is not one of Rudy\u2019s strong points.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Gerren Keith Gaynor", "Gerren Keith Gaynor Is A Digital Editor At Fox News.
