The government has rejected claims a Brexit deal cannot be negotiated in time for the EU leaders\u2019 summit on Thursday. The bloc\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said a deal is still possible this week but added that it looks \u201cmore and more difficult\u201d.\n\nAs a crash-out exit remains a possibility, Mr Carney said: \u201cThere are likely to be circumstances in an abrupt no-deal Brexit where certain businesses become uneconomic and they close.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cAnd so for the person who runs that business or works for that business or has someone in their family who works for that business, they will be directly affected \u2026 because of a loss of a market or potentially shorter-term disruption.\u201d\n\nThe central bank governor has previously made similar forecasts. In August, he said a no-deal Brexit would deliver a blow to a \u201cpotentially substantial number\u201d of companies.\n\nEven those businesses that survived would not emerge unscathed, he suggested at the time, citing a survey of 10,000 firms by the central bank.\n\n\u201cThey think that output will go down, they\u2019ll have to let people go \u2026 That is the view of those firms.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That will take a quarter off the currency\u2019s value before the EU referendum in 2016.\n\nLikewise, economists, including those at the Bank of England, have been warning of a stark impact on the broader UK economy from a disorderly Brexit.\n\nMr Carney said on Tuesday that the bank has some ability to support the economy in that case by bringing interest rates \u201cclose to but slightly above zero\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe can lower them and we can make sure that [cut] is passed on to households,\u201d he added.", "description": "A no-deal Brexit is likely to result in business closures and job losses, the governor of the Bank of England has said, sticking to his earlier warning as Britain enters the final fortnight before its planned departure from the EU.", "authors": ["Olesya Dmitracova"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/11/mark-carney-bank-england.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
