But public health agencies in California conveniently buried that story, and in late August, the CDC coincidentally announced a new grant for tobacco control programs.\n\nThe California Department of Public Health (CDPH) issued a \u201cHealth Alert\u201d at the end of the summer on \u201cSevere Acute Pulmonary Disease Associated with Cannabis or Cannabidiol Oil Vaping\u201d in Kings County, California. In its notice, CDPH noted that all the diseased patients had \u201cbeen vaping cannabis or cannabidiol (CBD) oils.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a \u201cJoint Health Advisory\u201d issued in August by Alameda County and the City of Berkeley reiterated similar findings, noting pulmonary illnesses were \u201cassociated with cannabis or cannabidiol oil vaping.\u201d\n\nCDPH issued another \u201cHealth Alert\u201d in late August stating that a majority of the \u201cpatients report vaping the cannabis compounds THC and/or CBD, and some patients also report vaping nicotine products, although the exact cause of illness is not yet known.\u201d\n\nBasically, public health is now suggesting that e-cigarette products that have been on the market since 2016 are suddenly causing hospitalizations\u2014even though those same hospitalizations were first linked to THC vaping products.\n\nOther states have also linked THC usage to hospitalizations. WDHS first publicized Wisconsin\u2019s hospitalizations on July 25. On August 29, WDHS found \u201c89 percent of the 27 cases interviewed \u2026 reported using e-cigarettes or other vaping devices to inhale THC products.\u201d On August 26, the Rhode Island Department of Health stated that while Rhode Island did not have any suspected cases, many of the patients in other-state hospitalizations \u201creported vaping cannabis products.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of these state-issued health alerts, the CDC announced a new grant to help states and localities combat tobacco. CDC-RFA-DP20-2001 hopes to award $540 million to recipients with the \u201ccapacity to implement statewide evidence-based policy, systems, and environmental strategies and activities to reduce tobacco use and dependence, secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure, tobacco-related disparities and associated disease, disability, and death.\u201d One goal is that award recipients will be able to \u201cprevent initiation of tobacco use (including emerging products including e-cigarettes) among youth and young adults.\u201d\n\nIn other words, despite the fact recent so-called \u201cvaping-related hospitalizations\u201d have actually been linked to black market THC products, the CDC is giving state health departments an incentive to further scrutinize e-cigarettes and vaping products.\n\nRegulated e-cigarette products are not causing hospitalizations. In fact, they have helped an estimated three million Americans quit smoking, have emerged as a tobacco cessation product that is twice as effective as traditional nicotine replacement therapy, and could, in fact, save states money by reducing health care costs.\n\nRecent headlines purporting that vaping devices available at retail outlets are causing hospitalizations are false and misleading. Moreover, there is far too much money involved in tobacco control, and states are all too eager to get their hands on it.", "description": "More and more young Americans are being hospitalized for side .09/07/2019 9:32:27AM EST.", "authors": ["Lindsey Stroud", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2014/69/caf265cb-1b43-4090-a89f-1457d521432f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
