The Windom Ranch community is located 25 miles north of downtown Durango and comprises about 24 properties all set on 20 to 30 acres each, Lesnock said.\n\nThe house is outfitted in wood with stone accents. Listing photos show an expansive deck with lots of outdoor living space.\n\nLesnock said the sellers, an older couple now retired from careers in finance, used the estate as a secondary property and are selling because they are not using it anymore. Mr. Lesnock declined to name owners; they also could not be identified through property records.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe records show that it has been listed twice.
