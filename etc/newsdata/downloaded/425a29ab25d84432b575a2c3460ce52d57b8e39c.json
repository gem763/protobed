Let's bring in Mary Bruce for more on that right now. Mary this, development that Jon reported on overnight, seven house freshman Democrats now say it's time to go forward on impeachment. Reporter: This is a very big deal. This is a group of freshmen Democrats from swing districts who could be vulnerable if impeachment backfires politically on Democrats. Pelosi has been reluctant to go down this road in part because she wants to protect she's seats. These are her so-called majority makers. Now they are telling her to go for it and that this cannot stand and if these allegations are true we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense. George, they are clearly giving the speaker political cover here to consider impeachment and they are not alone. We are now seeing some of Pelosi's closest allies saying this is a turning point. She is really taking charge of this issue today in the house. Reporter: George, this is going to be a pivotal day. The speaker will be sitting down with the chairman of the committees who are investigating this matter and then she's going to huddle with all of her members, every sing the Democrat in the house to try to chart a path forward. The big question for the speaker now is can she stem this rising tide? We now have 60%, more than 60% of her members who support impeachment. Now, Pelosi all along has been saying she needs two things in order to go down this road, Republican support and buy-in from the public. Right now she has neither. This is a matter of national security and the more that we learn about these revelation, the more the speaker is opening the door to consider impeachment. Seems to be in something of a new place. Mary, thanks very much.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "Congressional Democrats are facing renewed pressure to charge the president with articles of impeachment.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190924_gma_bruce2_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
