Business Insider Intelligence\n\nNetflix reportedly paid $500 million for 5 years of exclusive, global streaming rights to all 180 episodes (9 seasons) of \"Seinfeld,\" set to launch on the platform in 2021, after being exclusively on Hulu in the US since 2015.\n\nHBO Max has landed exclusive streaming rights for all 279 episodes (12 seasons) of \"The Big Bang Theory,\" set to launch on the platform in 2020. The deal also includes cable syndication rights that will go to Turner's TBS, also owned by WarnerMedia. Including syndication rights, the deal could be worth as much as $600 million.\n\nThese TV assets are so high-value because of their durability and their scarcity \u2014 they can help provide SVOD services a meaningful edge as a result. As such, when these series become exclusive, they can drive sub growth and retention: 45% of Netflix subscribers said they \"would consider canceling their subscription\" if traditional networks like NBC, Fox, and AMC pulled their content from Netflix, per Horowitz Research.\n\nClassic series like these can provide a backbone for services, while original series continuously refresh offerings. In fact, subscribers still mostly watch licensed content on platforms: 63% of Netflix US streams come from licensed content, with the most popular titles being led by \"The Office\" at No. 1 and \"Friends\" at No. 3, per 7Park Data. However, these shows will become even more scarce given how the paradigm for show creation, monetization, and valuation is shifting as streaming becomes the dominant model.\n\nScattering these series across various platforms will likely confuse the average consumer. Because these series are typically subject to multi-year licensing deals, if these shows continue to change hands amid rising fragmentation, this could spark frustration among those who want to watch all of the biggest hits. Consumers looking to optimize their paid media offerings will increasingly need to keep tabs on what services own or license what content.\n\nThey'll also be forced to choose from among the shows rather than have them all: The average consumer household is willing to spend $38 on paid streaming services, per Magid. A roundup of all major US SVOD services, including those that will have come to market by spring 2020, will amount to more than the average cable bill, about $107a month, and far above that price ceiling. Despite the ease of sign-up and cancellation for these services compared with pay-TV, there will be some elements of this system, including determining which shows are streamable where, that will arguably become more labor-intensive for the consumer.\n\nWe'll see a return to aggregation as an antidote to consumer frustration with service and series fragmentation. In the near term, this frustration will be ameliorated by distribution aggregators like Apple or Roku, and even pay-TV services like Comcast that have integrated streaming services into their search options. For example, Netflix has become one of the most popular voice searches on Comcast's X1 platform. Connected-TV platforms like Roku and Apple allow users to search for and navigate content across multiple apps simultaneously.\n\nHowever, in the medium- to long-term, we could see a resurgence of bundling models, wherein various media companies collaborate to bring their services under a single offering. This type of move would amount to a rebundling, as a solution to the chaos, expense, and heightened competitive stakes of unbundling.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
