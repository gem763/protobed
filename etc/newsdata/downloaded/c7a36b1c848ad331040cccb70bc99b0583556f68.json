Drops Album, Becomes World\u2019s Most Obscure Band", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Santiago Felipe/Getty Images\n\nIn many ways, my life in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election is extremely similar to my life in college. Both have been periods during which I learned a lot of information that I immediately forgot, and in both, I have been consumed with anxiety over what the future holds. Now, another unfortunate parallel: listening to an obscure, boring album by some guy I\u2019ve never heard of before in my life.\n\nOn Tuesday, someone named Tim Ryan \u2014 I think? \u2014 who is running for president, tweeted, \u201cI dropped an album. Really,\u201d and shared a link to his album, A New and Better Agenda, on Spotify.\n\nAs far as albums by white midwestern guys go, I would say A New and Better Agenda falls somewhere below Bon Iver\u2019s For Emma, Forever Ago, and above Jonathan Franzen\u2019s audiobook of The Corrections. It consists of ten tracks \u2014 an intro and an outro, and eight policy singles. In each one, Ryan speaks evenly into the mic, outlining his stances on subjects like \u201cImmigration,\u201d (track 9), \u201cCollege Affordability\u201d (track 6), and \u201cEducation\u201d (track 2).\n\nAs a whole, it\u2019s inconsistent. One of his weakest tracks, \u201cHealthcare,\u201d doesn\u2019t mention Medicare-for-all, and has hardly any melody to speak of. But track 4, \u201cRegenerative agriculture,\u201d makes some good points about the harmful environmental impact of agricultural monopolies, and I wouldn\u2019t mind listening to it while I go on a run, or when I\u2019m getting ready to go out.\n\nOverall, I would give the album a B-minus. It\u2019s not terrible, but both back in college, and now, I\u2019d probably rather listen to a cool professor.\n\nStay in touch.
