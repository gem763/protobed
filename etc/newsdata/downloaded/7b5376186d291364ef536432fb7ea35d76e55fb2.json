Insider has been polling since December how different candidates are perceived \u2014 as satisfactory or unsatisfactory nominees \u2014 among self-identified primary voters.\n\nRead more: How the INSIDER 2020 Democratic primary tracker works\n\nAs of September 25, around 56% of Democratic primary voters would be satisfied if Biden emerged as the party's nominee and 65% said they believed he could beat Trump. In contrast, 26% of primary voters expressed dissatisfaction and 37% said they believed Biden would lose in the general election.\n\nThe figures indicating dissatisfaction and odds of losing in the general election were among the highest recorded in the recurring poll so far, and suggests that primary voters are starting to cool on Biden. He's faced criticism for repeated gaffes and stumbled several times during the Democratic debates.\n\nBack in December, Biden held a 69% favorability rating among self-identified primary voters, though no poll was taken on his odds to win the general election. That rating held steady with some fluctuations through late April when Biden formally announced his 2020 presidential bid after months of hesitation.\n\nRead more: 3 big reasons Biden is no longer the definitive 2020 Democratic primary frontrunner\n\nOn April 26, a day after he launched his campaign, the former vice president had a 60% satisfaction rating among self-identified primary voters compared to 20% of those who expressed dissatisfaction. And he bet that his pitch on being the most electable candidate would resonate with primary voters \u2014 a strategy that has worked out among older voters and black voters. They form a key part of his base.\n\nYet in recent weeks, rival candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren's populist campaign has gathered steam. She overtook Biden in a key poll in Iowa in late September, underscoring the momentum she's gathered over the summer campaigning on a series of plans that would remake the American economy. That poll placed Warren at 22% and Biden at 20%. (That lead was within the margin of error.)\n\nThe dynamics are far from being set in stone. But Biden has centered his appeal on the campaign trail as being the candidate most able to defeat Trump in next year's general election and restore a sense of normalcy in Washington. If his electability numbers continue trending downward, Biden could be running into trouble.", "description": "Joe Biden's electability figures are declining in a recurring Insider poll, which could indicate Democratic primary voters are cooling on him.", "authors": ["Walt Hickey", "Joseph Zeballos-Roig"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9608c487966d1fe47a367f?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
