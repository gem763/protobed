Thrashed 4-0 by Dinamo Zagreb, and then beaten at home by Shakhtar Donetsk, the debutants are rushing to exit the European ball that they wished so desperately to attend. Their run in the tournament could effectively be ended by Manchester City over the next two matchdays, starting at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night.\n\nThere are no happily-ever-afters for footballing fairytales. Financial realities always come to bear eventually, and Atalanta remain a team representing a town of little more than 100,000 people. Even after rewarding their best players with new contracts in the summer, their first-team wage bill does not make it into Italy\u2019s top 10 (though it is far larger than Dinamo\u2019s \u2026).\n\nSerie A roundup: Sampdoria\u2019s Ronaldo Vieira racially abused by Roma fans Read more\n\nFor Atalanta to finish third in Serie A last season required richer clubs to underperform, while the likes of Duv\u00e1n Zapata, Josip Ilicic and Papu G\u00f3mez produced the best football of their careers. Neither scenario could endure indefinitely.\n\nAnd yet, the truth is that neither has unravelled just yet. Notwithstanding their European struggles, Atalanta have begun their domestic campaign in magnificent form. Heading into the international break this month, they were third in the table and top of the scoring charts \u2013 with 18 goals in seven games. Only three points separated them from the league leaders, Juventus.\n\nThey returned on Saturday for a daunting fixture away against Lazio. Their previous trip to face these opponents at the Stadio Olimpico, for the Coppa Italia final in May, ended in a 2-0 defeat. This time, Atalanta would be without Zapata, their top scorer, after he sustained an adductor strain while playing for Colombia.\n\nBy the 37th minute, they were 3-0 ahead. If anything, their lead could have had been even bigger. Atalanta were spell-binding, shredding Lazio\u2019s defence to ribbons with the speed and directness of their interchanges.\n\nGian Piero Gasperini redesigned his attack in Zapata\u2019s absence, deploying Mario Pasalic and Ruslan Malinovskiy as twin supports to Luis Muriel up front \u2013 operating on the left and right respectively. G\u00f3mez was given licence to travel precisely wherever he wanted \u2013 thwarting Marco Parolo\u2019s intention to restrict him from the base of midfield.\n\nThe first goal, in particular, was a thing of beauty, Pasalic launching the attack when he returned Robin Gosens\u2019s pass with a first-time backheel. The latter player hurdled a defender and carved inside, running beyond Muriel and just far enough to persuade the defenders to turn with him before cutting a pass back to the Colombian for a simple finish.\n\nMuriel would score Atalanta\u2019s second, too \u2013 his fifth goal in six appearances since joining from Sevilla (via a loan at Fiorentina) in the summer, despite the fact that this was only his second start. By the time G\u00f3mez ran on to Rafael Toloi\u2019s through-pass for the third, the contest appeared to be over.\n\nIn fact, it was anything but. Atalanta, for all their glorious attacking play, have been rather less brilliant at defending. They gifted Lazio a way back into the match when Jos\u00e9 Palomino took a clumsy second nibble at Ciro Immobile inside the box, his heel landing just barely \u2013 but enough \u2013 on the striker\u2019s little toe.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gian Piero Gasperini redesigned his attack for Atalanta\u2019s visit to Lazio in Serie A on Saturday. Photograph: Angelo Carconi/EPA\n\nImmobile converted in the 69th minute. Within seconds, it was 3-2, Remo Freuler\u2019s misstep allowing Joaquin Correa to get behind him and bury a shot into the roof of the net.\n\nEven then, Atalanta should still have won. In the 89th minute Ilicic, on as a substitute, fed G\u00f3mez with a cross from the right. The Lazio goalkeeper, Thomas Strakosha, was out sharply to deny him, but it is remarkable that in amongst the subsequent pinball of passes and blocked shots nobody found a way to force the ball across the line.\n\nInstead, the visitors completed their collapse in injury time, gifting Lazio a second penalty. Immobile was fishing for it with a deliberate step across Marten De Roon as the defender lunged after the ball inside his own box, but the result was a clear foul \u2013 despite Gasperini\u2019s protests to the contrary\n\nA 3-3 final scoreline scarcely felt credible in light of the one-sided first half, when Atalanta had seven shots on goal to Lazio\u2019s none. The sense of giddy disbelief inside the Olimpico was best summed up by Immobile\u2019s own celebration: as he attempted, and failed, to rip off his shirt, pulling it up over his head and then falling over sideways.\n\nEuropean roundup: Real Madrid and Bayern suffer shocks, Barcelona cruise Read more\n\nFor Atalanta, it was hard to know whether this performance should be viewed as encouraging or alarming before the visit to City on Tuesday. They had shown once again that they are no flash in the pan, comfortably outplaying opponents with greater resources. But they have now kept just a single clean sheet in 10 matches across all competitions. Such generosity will be punished harshly at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nEither way, do not expect Atalanta to take a step back on Tuesday night. In an interview with Sky Sports last week, G\u00f3mez said that his team \u201cmust try to dictate the play [in Manchester] as we always do in the league\u201d. He is not na\u00efve to the likely consequences. \u201cLet\u2019s recognise that City are at much higher level than Atalanta,\u201d he said, \u201cand maybe than any other team in Europe.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Cinderella is not dashing for the exit after all. She knows that she will be turfed out of the Champions League party sooner or later. What G\u00f3mez and his colleagues hope, at this stage, is that the world will at least get a glimpse of how well she can dance, before those diamond shoes come off.\n\n\u2022 Talking points will follow shortly", "description": "Football fairytales eventually hit financial reality, but Atalanta still hope to dance at the Champions League ball", "authors": ["Nicky Bandini"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ca5319429685b192bb7af88f9852243083a87e5/0_93_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=98076978a90353b7df532f078f7155f4", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
