Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks at a house party campaign stop in Rochester, N.H. Rising disagreement among congressional Democrats over whether to pursue impeachment of President Donald Trump has had little effect on the party\u2019s presidential candidates, who mostly are avoiding calls to start such an inquiry. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File)\n\nWho could have imagined that Elizabeth Warren could have the capacity to lie about her background? Shocking, if true.\n\nWarren has been sharing an anecdote lately involving the claim that she was once fired from a teaching job over being pregnant. This obviously plays into every woke stereotype involving discrimination and the current Democrat presidential candidate has decided to make her story a staple of her stump speech. You can find examples of it being spouted going back to the beginning of the year.\n\nThe problem was that Warren had told a completely different story back in 2007, as was covered here at RedState late last week.\n\nBut in a March 8, 2007 interview with Harvard Law Professor Leo Gottlieb, Warren made it clear that such discrimination had nothing to do with the loss of that teaching job. Warren told Gottlieb how she had earned a full scholarship to George Washington University at 16, and graduated with a degree in speech pathology and audiology, and didn\u2019t mention the commuter college that has become another pillar in her bio. She then explained that she left her public school job after one school year because she lacked the educational credentials to qualify for a permanent position, and that she decided on her own to abandon the calling.\n\nNote the language she uses about qualifying for a permanent position, because new documents show that not only was she lying about being let go, she had actually been offered another year long contract extension to keep her job.\n\nThe Free Beacon uncovered this today.\n\nMinutes of an April 21, 1971, Riverdale Board of Education meeting obtained by the Washington Free Beacon show that the board voted unanimously on a motion to extend Warren a \u201c2nd year\u201d contract for a two-days-per-week teaching job. That job is similar to the one she held the previous year, her first year of teaching. Minutes from a board meeting held two months later, on June 16, 1971, indicate that Warren\u2019s resignation was \u201caccepted with regret.\u201d\n\nAnd lest someone tries to pretend this is just Warren living in a gray zone and that she actually meant something else, nope. She pointedly claimed the principal \u201cdidn\u2019t ask\u201d her back.\n\nWarren\u2019s book, A Fighting Chance, published a year after she was sworn in as a senator in 2013, tells something of a different story, though the two aren\u2019t necessarily incompatible. \u201cBy the end of the school year, I was pretty obviously pregnant,\u201d Warren wrote in the book. \u201cThe principal did what I think a lot of principals did back then\u2014wished me good luck, didn\u2019t ask me back the next school year, and hired someone else for the job.\u201d\n\nThat, ladies and gentlemen, is calling bald-faced lying for political gain.\n\nSure, that\u2019s not necessarily unique among politicians, but what is unique is that the media don\u2019t care to report on this at all. If this were Trump or any other Republican caught in such an obvious lie, it\u2019d be headline news for a week but it won\u2019t be. Heck, they aren\u2019t even covering it.\n\nTake this ridiculous tweet by Nate Silver.\n\nI don't know this is a particularly serious scandal for Warren\u2014maybe it's something that just requirers a clear explanation from her campaign\u2014but it's interesting that it's circulating on both conservative Twitter and Bernie Twitter but getting almost no mainstream pickup. https://t.co/z7cNzwA8KX \u2014 Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) October 7, 2019\n\nYes, how very interesting. It\u2019s a total mystery why the mainstream media aren\u2019t picking up this story. It\u2019s not like they have been in the bag for Warren since the beginning of the summer or anything.\n\nTo tie a bow on all this, Warren is documented in the minutes of the 1971 meeting as actually quitting.\n\nToward the end of Warren\u2019s first year on the job, in April 1971, the board approved her contract for the following school year, the meeting minutes show. Two months later, the meeting minutes indicate that Warren had tendered her resignation. \u201cThe resignation of Mrs. Elizabeth Warren, speech correctionist effective June 30, 1971 was accepted with regret,\u201d the June 16, 1971, minutes say.\n\nIn summary, not only did the school board let her go as she claims, they offered her another year of employment. Her response was to tender her resignation two months later. Perhaps she did that out of frustration, but by her own admission, she didn\u2019t qualify for a more permanent position.\n\nNo matter how you read these documents, it\u2019s clear she lied and continues to do so.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
