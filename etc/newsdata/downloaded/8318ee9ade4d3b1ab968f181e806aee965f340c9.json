On October 13, tune in to CBC Gem for a livestream of Puccini's classic La Boh\u00e8me, live from Toronto's historic Tranzac Club. The acclaimed 19th-century opera has been reimagined with a contemporary twist by Against the Grain Theatre, which sees the Italian libretto translated into English and transports you from Paris's Latin-quarter to your local Canadian bar.\n\nOn September 27, La Boh\u00e8me hit the road on a cross-Canada tour kicking things off in Banff, Alberta. They'll be performing in bars across Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Yukon and Ontario, then landing in Toronto for a two-week residency.\n\nPresented by Against the Grain Theatre, Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity and CBC Arts, we'll be livestreaming La Boh\u00e8me straight to your living room (or cell phone). Think the Metropolitan Opera's Live in HD but scrappier. The La Boh\u00e8me broadcast will be hosted by CBC's Lindsay Michael, co-host and producer of Podcast Playlist and a trained opera singer herself.\n\nWatch the La Boh\u00e8me cast perform songs from the production:\n\nLa Boh\u00e8me follows a group of young artists through life, love and loss. Rodolfo (Marcel d'Entremont), is an aspiring screenplay writer who falls in love with Mim\u00ec (Jonelle Sills), a florist and sewing enthusiast. Meanwhile their friend Marcello (Clarence Frazer), an OCAD U-trained illustrator, is in an on-and-off again relationship with his flirty, unfaithful sweetheart, Musetta (Danika Lor\u00e8n). La Boh\u00e8me is directed by AtG founder and artistic director Joel Ivany with music director David Eliakis at the piano.\n\nAudiences can tune in on October 13 at 8pm ET (8:30pm NT) on CBC Gem and worldwide on the CBC Arts YouTube channel.\n\nWant to see La Boh\u00e8me live on their cross-Canada tour ?
