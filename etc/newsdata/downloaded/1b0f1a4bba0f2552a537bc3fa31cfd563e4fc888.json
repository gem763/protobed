Here's how its experts say it can be used more effectively.", "language": "en", "text": "The yield curve has been hailed as the go-to recession indicator by market participants for over half a century.\n\nIts ability to forecast economic downturns has become legendary, and for good reason. Since 1969, a US yield-curve inversion has preceded every recession on record.\n\nThe graph below depicts this dynamic in action:\n\nAQR, Bloomberg, NBER, Global Financial Data.\n\nAt present time, investors are riddled with anxiety as they grapple with multiple inversions of different sections of the yield curve.\n\nBut AQR Capital Management, a quant investing firm with over $194 billion in assets managed, thinks investors can benefit from viewing the yield curve in a different light. And it has identified a way to use shifting curves to one's advantage.\n\n\"Our results show the yield curve slope may be more useful for country allocation decisions than for market timing, and we remind readers that in both settings it is best combined with other predictors,\" the firm's portfolio-solutions group said in a recent note to clients.\n\nAQR notes that once the yield curve inverts, there's no telling how much time will elapse before the economy actually enters a recession. It says trying to accurately discern when one will hit isn't feasible, so there's no point in trying to nail a downturn in real time.\n\nThe firm instead looks at correlations between the curve's shape, gross-domestic-product growth, and stock/bond returns.\n\nAQR finds that, after an inversion, there is a positive relationship between yield-curve slope and GDP growth in the year that follows. This notion becomes clear in the last two boxes in the chart below. Historically, prospects for growth are muted when the curve is inverted, manifesting itself in median expansion just above 0%, while growth for a positively sloped curve hovers slightly over 3%.\n\nAQR, Global Financial Data.\n\nThe patterns we see when examining US equities and Treasurys are similar.\n\nThe charts below show how US stocks and the 10-year Treasury have fared the year after an inversion.\n\nAQR, Global Financial Data, DataStream, MSCI, Bloomberg\n\nThough the relationship is positive, there's a lot of variation in outcome. The ultimate takeaway is that investors shouldn't be too presumptuous when using the yield curve to predict equity and bond returns. AQR says it's better at predicting economic growth.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the firm instead analyzed how the yield curve would perform as a signal for cross-country allocation decisions. Its findings are in the two charts below.\n\nThe light-blue line \u2014 representing market timing \u2014 goes long in six markets (Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US) when the global average yield curve is steeper than its historical average and short when it's flatter.\n\nThe dark-blue line \u2014 representing the cross-sectional strategy \u2014 goes long the three countries with the steepest curves and short the three with the flattest curves (with weight inversely proportional to rank).\n\nAQR, Global Financial Data, DataStream, MSCI, Ibbotson, Bloomberg\n\nBoth strategies would have rewarded investors for shifting country allocations as yield curves shifted up and down. For these reasons, investors willing to embrace this strategy may have a shot at outperforming.\n\nBut with all of that established, AQR is quick to caution strong adherence. It says that even when used in a more nuanced form, the yield curve should still be used as a complementary piece.\n\n\"We strongly caution, however, that even the best predictive relationships come with wide uncertainty bands,\" the firm said.\n\nIt concluded: \"While the yield curve has historically been among the more reliable predictors of recessions and US market returns, our results show that realized outcomes are couched with uncertainty, and yield curve forecasts are best not used alone or aggressively.\"", "description": "Based on the relative steepness of the yield curve, AQR Capital Management thinks investors can benefit from a cross-country trading strategy.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7fd7ea2e22af26382e1fde-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
