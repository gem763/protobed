Never in the soil of the region, with the exception of Sikkim, do people remember having planted or cultivated this \u201cforeign\u201d fruit which is not quite foreign anymore.\n\nAbout 100-200 fruits grow on one tree.\n\nThis nutrient-laden \u201cbutter fruit\u201d is addictive for its milky texture. And the kinds that grow in the Northeast are smaller in size as compared to those imported from overseas, and definitely richer in flavour.\n\nOne may associate avocados with guacamole, a popular avocado dip, but people in the Northeast prefer to have it with their staple rice.\n\nThey scoop it out into a bowl of steaming rice, gently mix it with hands and relish it. It is considered a meal in itself. Or, they serve as salads by dicing into pieces and salt to taste, and nibble that with friends and visitors. Sometimes, they just scoop out the fruit and enjoy the delicious ripe fruit sans any accompaniment.\n\nDon't Miss 18.5 K SHARES 4.4 K SHARES 18.6 K SHARES 12.1 K SHARES 2.6 K SHARES\n\n\u201cIt tastes yummy just like that,\u201d says Dimpi Neihsial, 46-year-old who runs a garment store in Teddim Road, lamka, a town in Churachandpur district of Manipur.\n\nNeihsial became an overnight avocado connoisseur after she first tasted the fruit a few years ago. So, trust her when she shares her trick on how to gradually ripen the raw fruit.\n\n\u201cBury it in the grains of rice overnight and the next day, it\u2019s soft and tasty,\u201d she says. Even the skin has therapeutic value for Neihsial as applies on her skin for a supple feel.\n\nNeihsial loves her avocado and uses the peel for her skin.\n\nYishey Yongda, a senior government official of Sikkim, is quite used to having freshly-plucked avocadoes from the local market. \u201cThe fruit does not even need peeling. Gently roll on the table and press the fruit with your palm and apply pressure allowing the seeds to escape, and suck the fruit leaving the skin behind,\u201d she says.\n\nDr Ishi Khosla, renowned nutritionist, confirms the medicinal value of avocado. \u201cWhat you get is a good fat. The fruit is laden with vitamin E and A. It is perfect for a healthy heart, managing appetite and losing weight and get for those who have diabetics.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the good taste laden with vitamins is what makes it so desirable. Of course, the type of soil and climatic conditions are the deterring factors for growing avocado particularly in the region. It thrives well in well-aerated and loose soil and slightly colder climates.\n\nAll that fit the Northeast rather well. Perhaps that explains why avocados, which were never a part of the traditional crops, are making such inroads in the Northeast.\n\nFILE PHOTO. ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nAt New Bazaar, a popular local market of Churachandpur district, traders are exploring business options. The selling rate per kg ranges between Rs 200 to 250. Sometimes growers come and sell directly to customers. In Shillong too, avocados have prime spots along with other local fruits. Vendors rely on small-time suppliers who bring the fruit from Mizoram, or across the border town of Myanmar.\n\nIn Imphal, especially around the Deulaland market, a residential colony, vegetable vendors take to selling avocados that come from Ukhrul district and many traders in turn buy from these vendors to sell it to other pockets of the city. It\u2019s the same with fruit vendors at Bara Bazaar, a popular local market of Aizawl, who now stock avocados alongside other local fruits like oranges and banana.\n\nHow did avocado, which is far from being a traditional fruit of Northeast, make such inroads?\n\nIn fact, it all started with seeds that were brought by travellers from across the border in Myanmar and then the Mizos took it upon themselves to try their hands at growing a completely new fruit. That was some 15 years ago, recalls Dr Elizabeth Saipari, Director of Horticulture, whose department since experimented with avocado cultivation and saw some significant success over the years. But the challenge was, it bore fruit after four to six years and suddenly the trees would become lifeless and die.\n\nThat mystery is something her department is looking into even as they are exploring a more lucrative fruit crop: dragon fruit from Vietnam, which is another story altogether.\n\nAn Avocado seller in Churandpur.\n\nSince then, avocado, in seeds or in the fruit stage, travelled to other parts of Northeast states. Especially to Manipur \u2013 which shares a border in the southwest and many people took to planting it either in their gardens or farms.\n\nIn Arunachal Pradesh, Liza Apang, a government employee, says the mother-in-law planted from the seed about 15 years ago and it has been bearing fruits enough for the family. Elsewhere in the interiors of the state, there are locals who grow avocado but there is no way to quantify the number of growers, in fact in the entire region. But what\u2019s apparent is, avocado is no longer an unfamiliar fruit tree to own in one\u2019s garden.\n\nAlvina Chishi, a government employee, in Dimapur, for instance, planted two saplings that were gifted to her by her friends. One has long perished. Yet, she nurtures hope of a good harvest on the surviving tree.\n\nDimlianniang, 45, and her family are considering replacing their banana plantation to experiment avocado. Today, at her family farm in Churachandpur district, she and her husband have planted over 100 avocado trees. Each from seeds they ate and collected over a period of time. A seed can take about two to six weeks to sprout. While the family waits for harvest, Dimlianniang\u2019s diabetic mother-in-law who also has blood pressure regularly feasts on the fruit brought from local market.\n\nHealthy Buddha bowl lunch with grilled chicken, quinoa, spinach, avocado, brussels sprouts, broccoli, red beans with sesame seeds.

No wonder, most of the residents are planning or, are already reaping a bountiful harvest.\n\nTuisem Ngakang, 42, also from Ukhrul, is hoping to get a bountiful harvest from his avocado farm that he started three years ago. Meanwhile, he is happy supplying fresh avocados from Manipur to Delhi\u2019s Azadpur Market. He supplies over 20 tonnes of fruit per year. What makes the fruit from Northeast particularly richer in taste are the climatic conditions and the soil.\n\nBreakfast avocado sandwich - with crispy bacon, quail egg, tomatoes, goat cheese, green peas, radish, cucumber.

Yongda says \u201cPomsi\u201d, the indigenous name for avocado, has been growing since time immemorial. Pomsi grows in big trees and bear fruits every alternative year. In fact, locals are blessed to have two types of pomsi in Sikkim \u2013 oppom, as the name suggests, is tasty and milky. In fact, the word om, is a shortened name for milk. The second variety is called Chupom and the word \u201cchu\u201d means water and so, locals say, this variety is somewhat insipid and lacks flavour.\n\nIn the last 15 years, there is a new variety that people are experimenting with seeds from outside. \u201cBut the fruit of this is big and nowhere near the small indigenous variety that has rich flavour,\u201d says Yongda.\n\nThat explains why avocados from the Northeast will now find a proper position in the commercial market outside its territory.\n\nHoihnu Hauzel is an independent journalist, and founder of www.northeastodyssey.com\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY: THANGPU SAMTE / ILLUSTRATION BY RANAK MANN", "description": "Avocado has its origin in southern Mexico, but far from it, the utterly buttery fruit is finding new converts in many parts of India\u2019s Northeast.
