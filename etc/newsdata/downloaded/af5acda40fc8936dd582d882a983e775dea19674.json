May the peace of God be upon them and their hearts be comforted as they endure the storm. \u2014 Marianne Williamson (@marwilliamson) September 4, 2019\n\nIn the meantime, the threat posed by Hurricane Dorian is far from over. The storm could yet come ashore in Georgia, South or North Carolina, all of which remain within the National Hurricane Center\u2019s forecast cone.\n\nSouth Carolina is bracing for what could be the the region\u2019s second-worst flooding in 85 years, and more than 2 million people along the coast from Florida to North Carolina have been urged to evacuate.", "description": "The Democratic presidential candidate seemingly overlooked what's been described as an \"apocalyptic\" scene in the Bahamas.", "authors": ["National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ff1052400004f0074267b.jpeg?cache=uosq55n3j5&ops=1778_1000"}
