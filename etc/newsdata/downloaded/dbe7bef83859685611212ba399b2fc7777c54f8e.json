But it\u2019s also one of the most complicated, as its causes and effective treatments seem to differ from person to person.\n\nAny middle schooler with an internet connection knows that papules, pustules and blackheads start to form when dead skin cells and oils clog the tiny hair follicles that dapple our face and upper body. This creates the perfect space for a common microbe, Cutibacterium acnes, to dig in. But only some clogged pores go on to become swollen, red pimples. That happens when our own immune cells rush in, triggering inflammation. Even for dermatologists, the intricacies of this immune response still aren\u2019t clean, clear, or under control.\n\nTraditionally, doctors have thought of acne as a chronic skin condition, like psoriasis, with its signature scaly rash, or rosacea, which causes redness and bumps on the face. But in a new paper, published Thursday in the journal Trends in Immunology, a team of Hungarian scientists argue that acne is more akin to braces or promposals: a \u201cnatural, transient inflammatory state,\u201d ostensibly important to adolescent development. Using existing research on animals models, experiments on human skin samples and genetic data, the researchers conclude it all comes down to age-related changes in the skin\u2019s microbiome.\n\nMost people go through childhood with unblemished skin, but something changes with puberty. Specifically, the sebaceous glands. These microscopic sacs, which are attached to hair follicles, pump out oil to keep skin lubricated. While they serve up dewy Glossier lewks across our lifespan, the glands are particularly aggressive in puberty, when our systems are flooded with androgen hormones, which stimulate sebum production among other transformative functions.\n\nThe authors argue that these adolescent oil slicks give lipophilic (literally fat-loving) microorganisms like C. acnes the fuel they need to dominate their environment. But it\u2019s not just any C. acnes that proliferates: recent genomic evidence indicates the bacteria exists in many different strains, some of which are beneficial and others that are more likely to trigger inflammation. Sensing the microbiome is out of whack, the immune system then rushes in to battle, pimpling your skin in the process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very interesting proposition as to why we get acne,\u201d Suzan Obagi, a professor of dermatology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre and director of the UPMC Cosmetic Surgery & Skin Health Centre, told Gizmodo. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re realising more and more is the importance of this balance between humans and the microbiome.\u201d\n\nThese greasy teen years don\u2019t last forever, of course. Sebum production naturally tapers off as puberty wanes. The researchers think this explains why 85 per cent of teenagers experience acne, but as many as 50 per cent of those cases resolve spontaneously.\n\nWhile it may be a physically and psychologically traumatic condition to endure, the paper speculates acne could be a learning experience for the immune system, which leads to the crystal clear skin we expect from adulthood. Except... that\u2019s not how it always works out.\n\n\u201cI disagree with the transient element,\u201d Adam Friedman, a dermatologist at George Washington University School of Medicine who was not involved in the new paper, told Gizmodo. \u201cAs a practicing dermatologist, the number one patient I see is an adult, not a teenager.\u201d While some people may outgrow acne seemingly overnight, many patients need a skincare regimen or prescription treatments to keep pimples at bay in their 20s and 30s, and in some cases, even into their 40s and 50s. \u201cI think a lot of people underestimate acne,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cIt can have long-lasting implications,\u201d including scarring and discolouration.\n\nOther dermatologists were sceptical of the paper\u2019s emphasis on sebaceous glands, perhaps to the exclusion of other important pathways. Whitney High, a dermatologist at the University of Colorado who was not affiliated with the research, told Gizmodo that the paper overlooks the crucial role of hormones, which can alternately aggravate or alleviate acne, especially in women. And Friedman noted recent research showing C. acnes can produce short-chain fatty acids that disrupt immune regulation in sebaceous cells was absent from the study. (Andrea Szegedi, the corresponding author on the paper, declined to comment for this story.)\n\n\u201cThis is a very hot topic,\u201d Friedman said. Traditionally, doctors have prescribed acne patients retinoids, salicylic acid, and systemic antibiotics like tetracycline. In recent years, however, dermatologists have realised their field is an outsized contributor to antibiotic resistance, in part because people with acne are often on antibiotics for months or even years. But the growing recognition that acne is caused, at least in part, by a disrupted microbiome (and not, as the popular mythology goes, greasy foods or poor hygiene) means some doctors are changing course.\n\nInstead of destroying bad bacteria, Friedman said, they want to replenish what\u2019s good. He described modern approaches designed to fight acne by helping the skin microbiome maintain balance, such as probiotics, made from living microorganisms that encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria and fungi, and prebiotics, derived from compounds in food that serve a similar purpose. These solutions are \u201cstill in their infancy,\u201d Friedman said, but the message is clear: you can teach old skin new tricks.\n\nEven as acne treatments become more sophisticated, the disease has eluded scientists\u2019 attempts to fully understand it. And much to the chagrin of pimple sufferers everywhere, a foolproof cure doesn\u2019t seem to be anywhere in sight.", "description": "Acne is one of the most common skin conditions \u2014 up to 85 per cent of Australians will develop acne at some point in their life, according to ABC Health and Wellbeing.
