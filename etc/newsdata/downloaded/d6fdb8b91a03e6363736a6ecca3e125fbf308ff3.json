Photo: Baturay Tungur/Getty Images/EyeEm\n\nOh, the youths and their fascination with old technology! We knew vinyl was back, but were you aware that the cassette tape has reached critical mass \u2026 again? Against all odds, they have, and the leading cassette-maker National Audio Company is running into trouble filling all its orders due to a global shortage of high-grade gamma ferric oxide, a key ingredient in magnetic tape. It\u2019s not exactly because of cassette demand \u2014 actually, the only gamma ferric oxide factory in the world is being renovated \u2014 but the increased demand doesn\u2019t help, with cassette sales up nearly 25 percent last year. (Are that many people really still buying the Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack?) But if you\u2019re waiting on a cassette of something like Frankie Cosmos\u2019 Close It Quietly or Black Belt Eagle Scout\u2019s At the Party With My Brown Friends, two recent albums out on tape, don\u2019t fret \u2014 the NAC is expecting 11 tons of gamma ferric oxide this month and hiring more staff to make up for the shortage, promising that things will be back to \u201cnormal\u201d by the end of the year. Just not in the sense of, you know, not mining the earth to be able to produce recorded music.\n\nSome of the cassette manufacturing people that I've talked to about this haven't gotten this letter. I think it's probably good for all to see.\n\n\n\nSIRI. ALEXA. LEXA. How do I mine high grade gamma ferric oxide from the earth? LEXA! Ferric oxide! with Gamma? PRECIOUS METALS!?
