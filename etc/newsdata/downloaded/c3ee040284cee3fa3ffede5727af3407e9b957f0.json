(AP) - The New York Jets have promoted quarterback Luke Falk from the practice squad to serve as the backup to starter Trevor Siemian against the Cleveland Browns.\n\nThe team also announced it waived safety Bennett Jackson a few hours before the game Monday night.\n\nSiemian is starting because Sam Darnold is out while recovering from mononucleosis. The second-year quarterback is likely sidelined for several weeks.\n\nFalk was claimed by the Jets off waivers from Miami in May. He threw for 230 yards and two touchdowns in the preseason for New York, winning the No. 3 job over Davis Webb.\n\nJackson was inactive for the Jets\u2019 season opener against Buffalo. He was claimed off waivers earlier this month from Baltimore.\n\nJackson turned 27 on Monday and the team wished him a Happy Birthday on Twitter - before later deleting it after he was waived.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The New York Jets have promoted quarterback Luke Falk from the practice squad to serve as the backup to starter Trevor Siemian against the Cleveland Browns.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
