The England manager, whose team face Bulgaria in Sofia on Monday in the second game of the Euro 2020 qualification double-header, felt the tremors from the Czech reverse more keenly because of how smoothly his team had progressed in the campaign up to that point.\n\nEngland\u2019s 100% record was taken apart and so was Southgate\u2019s faith in the 4-2-3-1 system with which he began the game. With his team over-run in midfield and unable to take a grip in creative terms, he reverted to a more familiar 4-3-3 for the second half, which served to bring more cohesion. That said, the overall performance fell some way short of the expected levels and Southgate indicated that a move to a back three was an option, although most likely not for the Bulgaria game.\n\nGareth Southgate\u2019s misfiring England lose control in haunting defeat | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nSouthgate does not feel he has the personnel in his squad to play that way and it is why he did not do so against the Czechs. John Stones is missing because of injury while Joe Gomez has been out of the Liverpool team and both Tyrone Mings and Fiyako Tomori lack international experience. Kyle Walker is out of favour.\n\n\u201cWe are in a difficult situation in terms of the players that have played international football with us in that area of the pitch and who are playing regularly with their clubs,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cSo that\u2019s part of the reason we didn\u2019t do that [play a back three] against the Czechs. It\u2019s certainly something we\u2019ve considered and I don\u2019t think we can dismiss. I\u2019m not sure, ahead of Monday, if that\u2019s the right thing to do but we\u2019re very aware and assessing those things.\u201d\n\nSouthgate switched to a back three against Lithuania in October 2017, believing that the system offered greater stability for the World Cup finals in Russia, and it provided the platform for the run to the semi-finals. Since then, he has overseen a move to 4-3-3 to try to make the team more proactive but the quest for the ideal balance continues.\n\nSouthgate started with Jordan Henderson and Declan Rice in front of the back four in Prague and the hope was that the formation would make England more solid without the ball and less vulnerable to the counterattack. But with Mason Mount pressed close to Harry Kane, the Czechs enjoyed numbers and space in midfield.\n\nWhat did not help Southgate was the team\u2019s poor distribution, with Henderson particularly culpable. Harry Winks is in his midfield thoughts for Bulgaria.\n\n\u201cWe ended up in a situation where we were no more secure and we didn\u2019t use the ball as well \u2013 hence the switch back at half-time,\u201d Southgate said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019ve had a look at it [4-2-3-1]. Is that experiment over? Well, it\u2019s not something we should dismiss but we\u2019d have to look at the personnel in the roles as to whether that would work. Equally, there are other things we need to assess rather than just when we\u2019re a 4-2-3-1, whether that can work moving forward.\u201d\n\nSouthgate does not feel that going back to his World Cup system would represent a retrospective step; rather it would give him another option and he said there remained the time to switch before the Euro finals.\n\n\u201cI think players take in tactical concepts very quickly, especially top players,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to keep reflecting on what\u2019s working, what\u2019s possible and learn from every experience we have. We\u2019ll learn a lot from Prague. We\u2019ve had straightforward qualifying games that haven\u2019t challenged us but this was a proper test and we didn\u2019t come through, so it would be naive not to take the lessons from what we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nAs ever after an England defeat, the sense of soul-searching was pronounced. The \u201cReality Czech\u201d headlines were appropriate. Perhaps the straightforward nature of England\u2019s first four qualifying wins had made for overconfidence and it is a challenge to stop the fans, in particular, from imagining themselves in a semi-final at Wembley. To many of them, it has been written. But while the defence remains such a glaring problem and young players throughout the set-up bed in, Southgate can safely preach realism.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to tell the public not to dream,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cInternally, we have to be different and realistic. We\u2019re not under any illusions. To be a really top team, with players with experience of winning the biggest matches \u2013 we\u2019re still some way from that. We found a way to progress through the World Cup with what was a relatively inexperienced team and that\u2019s what we\u2019re always trying to do.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still young and relatively inexperienced, and some of the performances in qualifying have hidden that a little bit. The test is completely different to the one we had in the Nations League semi-final against Holland and that we\u2019ll face against the best teams next summer.\u201d", "description": "Gareth Southgate has said that he would consider a switch back to a three-man defence following England\u2019s defeat", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53161cde54832503faffc4827a56488f6245ee64/0_96_2141_1284/master/2141.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8d841e62ae8f1d5ab4d9b30985156a5c", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
