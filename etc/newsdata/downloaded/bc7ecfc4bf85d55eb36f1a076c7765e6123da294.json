USA Today\n\nAt a news conference in Japan, where Houston Rockets are playing this week, Silver said he decided to issue a new statement because he thought there was a lot of \"misunderstanding\" about the NBA's position after it initially called Morey's tweet \"regrettable.\"Morey found himself in the middle of a major controversy when he tweeted Friday in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. He promptly apologized Monday for \"any offense\" caused by the tweet that has now been deleted.But Morey's support for the protests in the Chinese-ruled city angered many in Beijing.The NBA's Chinese partners suspended ties with the franchise, Chinese sponsors yanked their money and Chinese television outlets said they would no longer air Rockets games.Basketball is very popular in China, where the NBA has been building its presence for the past three decades. The Houston Rockets are also widely followed in the country after the franchise drafted Chinese player Yao Ming in 2002.On Sunday, the NBA saidthat the views expressed by Morey \"deeply offended\" many of their fans in China, but the league's response was criticized by U.S. politicians across the political divide who called out the NBA for \"kowtowing\" to China.Silver said he realizes there could be consequences from Morey's tweet and the NBA's position on it.\"We will have to live with those consequences,\" he said on Tuesday.Chinese state television said Tuesday it will no longer air two NBA preseason games set to be played in the country, which Silver called \"unfortunate.\"Chinese state media has cast the Hong Kong protesters as rioters amid months of clashes.After another weekend of violence that shut down Hong Kong's metro rail system, the city's embattled leader Carrie Lam said Tuesday that the Chinese military could step in if the protest movement escalates.\"I still strongly feel that we should find the solutions ourselves,\" she said. \"But if the situation becomes so bad, then no options could be ruled out if we want Hong Kong to at least have another chance.\"", "description": "Politicians criticized the league for its original response to a post supportive of Hong Kong protesters by Houston Rockets general manager.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4217126/1000x563_nbc-191008-daryl_morey-mc-943_b5b7f838d424c3c31726cc781077be30.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
