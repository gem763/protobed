These amazing women inspire us both on and off the catwalk!'.\n\nIn a statement issued this morning, the publication apologised for 'making several mistakes' in their attempt to highlight the work of models of colour 'from different angles', adding 'we apologise to anyone we might have hurt'.\n\nGerman magazine Elle has issued an apology after being slammed for their November issue, which features the tagline 'black is back' and appears to proclaim that 'models of colour are back in fashion'\n\nInstagram account Diet Prada, an authority on holding fashion brands accountable for their messages, shared a picture of the cover and inside feature, slamming the publication.\n\nThey wrote: 'Not a good look, Elle Germany. For their November 2019 issue, the presumably white-led publication declares that 'black is back'.\n\n'Ironic when they, along with much of the fashion industry, have been complicit in denying visibility to black models until relatively recently.'\n\nThey added: 'Oh, and apparently they can't actually tell models apart. In the bottom middle, a picture of Naomi Chin Wing is used in place of Janaye Furman.\n\n'And Joan Smalls has been around for a minute/hasn't gone anywhere lmao (sic). The issue, titled 'Back to Black', also features a white model on the cover. You can't make this stuff up!'\n\nThe cover reads 'Back to black - Black is back again: irresistibly' and the translated feature's says: 'Beautiful, successful, [politically] active: Never were models of colour so in demand as now.

Not trying to defend or attack anyone! I do think if there was more diversity in the firm or in the magazine advising this would never have happened!\n\n'Black is not back lol! It was never allowed! How many times have I been told black covers don\u2019t sell so The magazines are catering to the Clients but maybe it\u2019s also time for a change! Interesting topic !

This has definitely been a learning experience for us and we apologise for anyone we may have hurt or offended.'", "description": "German magazine Elle has issued an apology after being slammed for their November issue, which features the tagline 'black is back' and proclaims that 'models of colour are back in fashion'.", "authors": ["Jessica Rach For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/09/20366540-0-image-a-2_1572427554486.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
