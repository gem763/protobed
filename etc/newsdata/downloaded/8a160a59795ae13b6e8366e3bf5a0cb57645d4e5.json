Bri is still a thing? We\u2019re expected to watch Demi and Kristian have full conversations without looking at each other? Clay is made of sweat somehow? He\u2019s more emotional stress sweat than man at this point, and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Without any drama from Blake or Kristina or Caelynn or Dean, Bachelor in Paradise has to do its best to remind us that this is a show about LOVE and SERIOUS RELATIONSHIPS that will be taken SERIOUSLY even though these people have only been dating for ABOUT THREE WEEKS OR SO.\n\nThe reason Bachelor in Paradise always fumbles the transition into this more serious and romantic phase of the show is because it doesn\u2019t present any other option for the contestants than walking away with an engagement and a promise to grow old and crash children\u2019s birthday parties together for the rest of their lives. Chris Harrison stomps around on the beach like some Commitment Babadook, saying that the only real relationships are the ones that are SERIOUS and will end in MARRIAGE, when his Babadook ass knows that they\u2019ve only been there for three weeks. When a show that trades in drama for the first 87 percent of the season has to quickly remind us that these are people who like each other, it is jarring. So let\u2019s get to it.\n\nThe episode opens with Dylan and Hannah waking up to find out that their former romantic tormentor has decided to leave. They were too busy living inside each other\u2019s swimsuits to notice that Blake had left. The sudden departure of two people no one seemed to tolerate or understand has sent a shockwave through Paradise.\n\nThe first couple to succumb to the Final Weeks of Paradise pressure are Demi and Kristian. Demi is still trying to figure out who she is and carries a lot of anxiety about being a woman who dates other women. Kristian feels a lot of pressure to hold in her emotions because Demi is the one who is supposed to have the anxiety in the relationship. Can we start using that instead of asking, \u201cWho is the guy? Who is the girl?\u201d in relationships? \u201cWhich one of you just has anxiety and which one of you is allowed to express that anxiety?\u201d\n\nThe most confusing thing about this whole narrative is that before Kristian arrived in Paradise, Demi framed their relationship as a very serious one. If that\u2019s the case, shouldn\u2019t they have had one of these conversations about what it means for Demi to be an out woman? Or how they would define their relationship? Or shouldn\u2019t have they been around other humans for Kristian to affectionately touch in a non-romantic manner? My cynicism is telling me either Demi and Kristian\u2019s relationship wasn\u2019t as serious outside of Paradise as they made it out to be, or the show is encouraging Demi and Kristian to have these conversations on-air so they can again be a \u201cprogressive\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d dating show for deigning to have two queer women express their opinion on TV.\n\nWhile Kristian and Demi are trying to figure their relationship out, the date cards start arriving. Wait \u2026 this is still a week with date cards and a rose ceremony? End thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis.\n\nHannah and Dylan head out on a date to a random Mexican child\u2019s birthday party. Do you ever think these children or families look at their photo albums years later and are like, \u201cDoes anyone remember these two aspiring personal trainers\u2019 names? Kourtneylynn? Hannah Q? \u2026 Was her name \u2026Stamp? That doesn\u2019t sound right.\u201d Hannah and Dylan say \u201cI love you\u201d to each other and force a Mexican family to listen to their bad Spanish.\n\nUp next in the gauntlet of emotional terrors is Connor! He wakes up after watching Caelynn make out with Dean in front of him, and he only wants to meet Whitney. He really wanted to meet her and thought she would show up, but after he counts to 20, he decides to leave \u2014 approximately three minutes before Whitney arrives in Paradise. What producer fucked up the airport-arrival spreadsheet? When Whitney arrives on the beach and sees that Connor has left, she gets back into the passenger van and heads over to his GIGANTIC hotel room. That\u2019s what the holding cells look like on this show? I\u2019m going to pull a Calloway and buy some followers and try to go on this show just for the time off. Sydney says that Whitney leaving Paradise for Connor is really romantic. So would be sliding in her DMs, but ABC can\u2019t make any advertising money off that.\n\nClay and Nicole head out on a completely superfluous date card. What\u2019s different? She\u2019s too invested and his entire body is sweating. Clay tells her that he\u2019s starting to fall in love with her, which is too damn much to say to someone you\u2019ve been dating for only three weeks. They slow dance while a man sings a song that\u2019s too on the nose. It contained the lyric, \u201cI hope we can move to a place of less anxiety.\u201d\n\nChris and Katie are having to deal with the fact that Chris is completely incapable of making up his mind or enjoying a single moment in Paradise. He\u2019s second-guessing everything about their relationship. Seeing Katie go to bed crying while Chris sits at the bar slightly wringing his hands really broke my heart. Katie seems to be intent on making this work with Chris because she\u2019s put in the work already, and Chris seems content to just let his emotional hesitancy destroy his girlfriend. He could spare Katie and choose to leave Paradise altogether or actively work to be with her, but he chooses neither option.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the final rose ceremony (but these rubes don\u2019t know that) and Chris Harrison comes in and tells them that the cocktail party is CANCELED and if you\u2019re not in a relationship, it\u2019s time to take your ass home. Luke S. is up first, for some completely inexplicable reason. He asks Bri if she\u2019s willing to accept his rose and she says \u201cno.\u201d Chris Harrison says that no one has ever done that before, then opens his rose up to the floor. Haley has no romantic options but chooses instead to say that Luke S. is nowhere near as attractive as Nick Viall! So she keeps her mouth shut. Thus goes the most humiliating elimination in Bachelor history.\n\nMatt can\u2019t decide between Sydney and Bri because he has a deep emotional connection with Sydney but Bri is like a supermodel. Uuugggghhhh what is a man to do?!? He picks Bri, who immediately dumps him the next morning. What would his mother say! Everyone else picks exactly who we would expect them to pick. Rev, Sydney, and Haley all head home. On the van ride to the AMAZING holding hotel, Sydney breaks down crying about how she continues to put herself out there, and says that Matt is going to get dumped. Sydney has always been one of my favorites.\n\nThe next morning, Chris Harrison lures them into a dark room and tells them all that the end is near. Every couple must offer a blood sacrifice to the Spirits of Paradise and if the spirits dance, then their relationship is solid. Obviously Dylan and Hannah are heading to the fantasy suites and somehow, Clay and Nicole are also heading to the fantasy suites. Chase and Angela\u2019s relationship disintegrates in a five-second clip.\n\nThen Tayshia and John Paul Jones have to have one of those difficult conversations, in which JPJ confesses to Tayshia that he is in love with her. Have you noticed that Tayshia talks to JPJ like he\u2019s an actual child? She uses the same tone that kindergarten teachers use during unstructured playtime. She tells him that he doesn\u2019t know what he wants and she just can\u2019t get where he needs her to be. JPJ stands up for himself in the most reasonable way possible when he tells her that she doesn\u2019t know what he knows. Their time in Paradise was the most magical time in his life. Let\u2019s not forget that he\u2019s only like 24 and someone not going to prom was unthinkable to him. Tayshia runs after him and starts crying and tells him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Another couple bites the dust.\n\nFinally, Katie and Chris sit down and Chris tries his best to break up with Katie but she won\u2019t let it happen. He starts to say everything you should and would say in a breakup, and then he goes, \u201cIs this happening? Is this really happening? I don\u2019t want this at all.\u201d Then she TALKS HIM out of BREAKING UP WITH HER? The best he can muster is, \u201cI don\u2019t not want to try.\u201d This motherfucker is in his 30s. Double negatives DO NOT FLY in your 30s. Chris then tells her that he\u2019s a difficult person and her putting up with him is a testament to how great she is. He could try to deal with his behavior or challenge his typical way of thinking, but no, Katie is so brave for dating a straight man with unresolved emotional issues. Katie says she likes him and he makes her happy and she doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s settling. This is the night, such a beautiful night and they call it BELLA NOTTE!!!\n\nAnd since Bachelor in Paradise is not going to let Demi and Kristian not make it to the Fantasy Suites, they\u2019re on their way, along with Dylan and Hannah, Katie and Chris, and Nicole and Clay. Maybe next week, they\u2019ll all be getting engaged so ABC can keep making that good Neil Lane money.\n\nBachelor Nation Newsletter Be the first to know who's here for the right reasons Email Terms & Privacy Notice By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.", "description": "The final days of Paradise loom, and it\u2019s just chaos out there.
