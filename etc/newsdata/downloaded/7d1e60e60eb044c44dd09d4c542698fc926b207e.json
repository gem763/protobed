He wrote great songs such as Mack The Knife (from The Threepenny Opera) for Berlin, and standards like September Song for Broadway, all showing how consistently his talent was employed throughout his career.\n\nThe Silver Lake, part of Weill\u2019s decade-long collaboration with the playwright Georg Kaiser, was simultaneously premiered in three German cities in 1933, and almost immediately suppressed by the Nazis.\n\nClarissa Meek is first class as housekeeper Frau Luber, and Ronald Samm (above) is a touching Olim, the former police officer who devotes his life to Severin, having originally shot him\n\nDeemed \u2018degenerate\u2019, it disappeared and has been rarely heard since. But it too is both tuneful and intelligent, which explains its appeal to English Touring Opera\u2019s James Conway.\n\nIt\u2019s a true singspiel (\u2018play-with-singing\u2019), defined by Weill as an entertainment \u2018where the drama justifies its right to existence in spite of the clear dominance of the music\u2019.\n\nFor those on ETO\u2019s tour route, don\u2019t be put off by the fact that this is an unknown piece; as I have explained, there are compelling historical reasons for that.\n\nThe Silver Lake is very well performed by a well-chosen ETO cast, and, at two-and- a-quarter hours, doesn\u2019t outstay its welcome. Luci Briginshaw, as young Fennimore, stands out as a singer to watch.\n\nShe is well partnered by the imposing figure of David Webb as her stricken employer, Severin. Clarissa Meek is first class as housekeeper Frau Luber, and Ronald Samm is a touching Olim, the former police officer who devotes his life to Severin, having originally shot him.\n\nThe conductor, James Holmes, is a Weill specialist who inspires the orchestra to give a performance so compelling that I am spending this weekend listening to more Weill on the basis that he really is unfairly neglected.\n\nCan I say more? Catch it if you can.\n\nenglishtouringopera.org.uk\n\nGluck Orfeo Ed Euridice Out now\n\nRating:\n\nWith Berlioz\u2019s anachronistic 1859 version of Gluck\u2019s masterpiece in London at the moment, it\u2019s a happy chance that brings along this superb 88-minute live recording of the original 1762 score, captured at St John\u2019s Smith Square in May 2018, which comes with excellent notes.\n\nIestyn Davies is on sparkling form as Orfeo, as are Sophie Bevan as Euridice and Rebecca Bottone as Amore.
