Blame them.", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE SportsPulse: Week 6 had some stunning results but none bigger than the Cowboys loss to the winless New York Jets. As Trysta Krick details, they do have one saving grace. USA TODAY\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. \u2014 The Detroit Lions blew it.\n\nThe Lions had a chance to take over first place in the NFC North on Monday night.\n\nThey had an opportunity to make a major statement against the Green Bay Packers.\n\nBut they let it slip away.\n\nBecause they blew a lead and wasted scoring opportunities, getting into the red zone three times, but walking away with just one touchdown. So that\u2019s on the Lions.\n\nYou can\u2019t do that against the Packers and expect to win. Not at Lambeau Field. And the Lions lost, 23-22.\n\nAs the Lions were melting down the stretch, it looked so familiar, just like the game against Kansas City, when they once again jumped out to a lead and then let it slip away.\n\nThis time it was Aaron Rodgers, leading the Packers downfield in the final minutes. Getting free on runs. Making clutch throws.\n\nBut the Lions didn\u2019t blow this game by themselves. The refs made several questionable calls that cost them. Trey Flowers was called for two penalties \u2014 illegal use of hands to the face mask \u2014 and both led to Green Bay touchdowns.\n\nBut he appeared to grab the shoulder pads, not the face mask.\n\nThe final call gave the Packers all they needed on their game-winning drive: A 23-yard field goal as time expired.\n\nMNF: Packers rally to beat Lions on Mason Crosby's winning FG\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER: Sign up now to receive football news in your inbox\n\nPackers safety Adrian Amos breaks up a pass intended for Lions running back Kerryon Johnson.

T.J. Hockenson couldn\u2019t hang onto a touchdown pass and they had to settle for a field goal.\n\nThey also made mistakes on special teams. First, Sam Martin kicked the ball out of bounds, giving the Packers a short field. When the Packers lined up for a field goal, the Lions lined up with 12 men on the field. That\u2019s just boneheaded. The kind of thing that lets a team back into a game.\n\nTwo plays later, Jamaal Williams was scampering into the end zone on a touchdown.\n\nIn the third quarter, the Lions wasted another opportunity, after Dee Virgin caused a fumble on a punt.\n\nThe Lions advanced inside the Packers 25-yard line and had to settle for a field goal. Technically, it wasn\u2019t inside the red zone. But it was another blown opportunity, wasting a short field.\n\nThe refs\n\nI hate mentioning the refs in a story, but this was just crazy.\n\nOne of the most questionable calls came in the fourth quarter. Flowers was flagged for an illegal use of hands, which was essentially a turnover, giving the Packers an extra possession. And it seemed to be a horrible call. That gave the Packers a first down and another chance.\n\nThree plays later, Rogers hit Allen Lazard on a tremendous, 35-yard touchdown\n\nFinal: Packers 23, Lions 22.\n\n\n\nLions blow a 13-point lead, settle for 5 field goals and have multiple blown calls go against them but, on the bright side, in 5 billion years the sun will swell into a red giant, vaporize the Earth and obliterate all evidence of this game happening \u2014 Detroit Free Press (@freep) October 15, 2019\n\nA hot start\n\nThe Lions jumped out to a 10-0 lead, thanks to an aggressive, gunslinger approach on offense and a defense that was making plays.\n\nThe Packers\u2019 first drive fizzled when, if you are a Packers fan, you saw Geronimo Allison drop a certain first down. But if you are a Lions fan, you saw Justin Coleman knock it loose. He was fantastic.\n\nOn another drive, the Lions\u2019 A\u2019Shawn Robinson came off a block and knocked the ball away from Aaron Jones, killing a Green Bay drive.\n\nBut they wasted those plays.\n\nThey wasted this game.\n\nFollow the Detroit Free Press' Jeff Seidel on Twitter @seideljeff.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
