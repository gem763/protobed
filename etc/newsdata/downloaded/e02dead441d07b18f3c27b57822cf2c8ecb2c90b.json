The parade was evidence of a serious threat China poses not just to its Asian neighbors but to the U.S. itself.\n\nThis is something every American ought to be worried about \u2013 particularly members of Congress \u2013 regardless of political party. But unfortunately, the Democratic obsession with removing President Trump from office is dominating the news and taking attention away from China\u2019s growing military might, along with just about all else.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping presided over the display of Beijing\u2019s military muscle and promised that \u201cno force can shake the status of this great nation.\u201d\n\nGOP LAWMAKERS SLAM CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY'S 'APPALLING RECORD OF REPRESSION' ON 70TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nThe new Chinese weapons, some of which took decades to develop, make the threat posed by North Korea look small by comparison and rival the threat to the U.S. posed by Russia.\n\nThe parade Tuesday featured 15,000 troops and powerful new weapons including drones, sci-fi-style hypersonic missiles, and long-range intercontinental missiles capable of easily striking the U.S. homeland with a nuclear weapon.\n\nAnd that was just for starters. Beijing also put on display two versions of what defense experts have dubbed \u201ccarrier-killer\u201d missiles.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping presided over the display of Beijing\u2019s military muscle and promised that \u201cno force can shake the status of this great nation.\u201d\n\nNamed the DF-21D and DF-26, these missiles could give China the ability to fundamentally challenge the balance of power in Asia by rendering U.S. naval warships and carrier battle groups potentially obsolete. The missiles could turn the mighty aircraft carrier into the modern-day version of a battleship \u2013 a tourist attraction as a floating museum rather than a weapon of war.\n\nIf conflict were to break out, China would use its carrier-killer missiles as a first-strike weapon. Fired from as far as almost 1,900 miles, the missiles would come down on their target at a speed approaching 20 times the speed of sound with devastating destructive power.\n\nMoving fast while also maneuvering to avoid advanced U.S. missile defenses, the missiles could potentially sink U.S. warships patrolling as far away as Guam.\n\nThe new Chinese missiles could have a powerful impact even if they are never fired, because they could serve as a deterrent that would keep U.S. warships away from China\u2019s coastline and areas of contention like Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\nAs a result, Beijing might be able to win a future conflict simply by keeping Washington from coming to the aid of an ally in need.\n\nThe good news is that the Trump administration understands the growing Chinese military threat and has laid out strong plans to ensure our interests in Asia and those of our allies are protected.\n\nAs an example of this understanding, President Trump made the right call in withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, which limited the U.S. from developing its own missiles that can counter China\u2019s missile buildup. And, in fact, Washington is already testing new missile platforms that could very well turn the tables on China in a military clash.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nTrump has also increased overall military spending, reversing the disastrous cuts that damaged military readiness under the Obama administration. In addition, Washington is once again building new generations of attack and ballistic missile submarines, working to ensure our allies have the equipment to withstand a Chinese strike while also getting serious on missile defense.\n\nThen there is Trump\u2019s push to ensure China\u2019s military rise does not come from economic growth stolen in unfair trade practices.\n\nBefore Trump took office, it was common practice in Asia circles to say that China\u2019s economic rise was unstoppable, and that unfair trade was just something we must accept as the price of doing business with Beijing. That narrative is dead, as the Trump administration seems determined to strike a fair and reciprocal trade deal, no longer allowing China\u2019s mercantilist trade policies to underwrite its military rise.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nBut as is often the case when challenges arise in Asia, Washington seems destined to become distracted once again, thanks to the unending desire by Democrats to impeach the president.\n\nIf America turns inward for too long thanks to this unnecessary and sad attempt by Democrats to depose Trump because they can\u2019t win at the polls, many of our allies and partners in Asia could very well come to question our commitment to take on the China challenge. And that would suit Beijing just fine.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY HARRY KAZIANIS", "description": "China sent the world a loud wake-up call Tuesday with one of largest military parades in global history to mark the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Communist Party rule.
