I didn\u2019t have any more after that, which is probably why my feet aren\u2019t as good as they could be.\u201d\n\n(Image: Guy Levy/BBC/PA Wire)\n\nTo combat the disease, the young schoolboy from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was given a trial drug at London\u2019s Great Ormond Street hospital.\n\nDuring his lengthy stays there, Paralympian table tennis player Will, now 31, remembers deciding at one stage that he\u2019d simply had enough.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough one. I knew I was really ill but I remember saying to my mum that I didn\u2019t want any more treatment. I refused to go.\n\n\u201cBut I said to her, \u2018If I don\u2019t go back, will I die?\u2019 and my mum said, \u2018yeah\u2019. So I was like, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll go back\u2019. I think those sorts of times make you a lot stronger.\u201d\n\nThankfully, the drugs halted the potentially fatal disease. \u201cIt managed to get me through it, I\u2019m so lucky that it worked,\u201d he says now with a laugh. \u201cTo be alive is amazing, really.\u201d\n\nThe cheerful athlete says credit for helping him survive the crisis must go to his \u201camazing\u201d mum Chrissie. \u201cMy mum was so brave, she was a massive support,\u201d he says. \u201cI only saw her cry once during the whole time I was ill. And that was by mistake!\u201d\n\nHe knows that his illness also affected his brother Tom, now 34, and stepdad Gary.\n\n\u201cIt was tough for them too because they were basically home alone for such a long time. I took all the attention from my mum.\u201d\n\nIt was a gift from his grandma that was to change his life for ever \u2013 a mini-table tennis table so he could play on the ward. \u201cThat\u2019s when I first started,\u201d he explains. \u201cThen when I left Great Ormond Street I just wanted to carry on, so we got a table tennis table in the garage and then I started playing for a club.\u201d\n\nThe sport became his passion but it didn\u2019t stop him getting unwanted\n\nattention at secondary school.\n\n\u201cI used to struggle with confidence a lot,\u201d Will confesses. \u201cObviously when you\u2019ve got a disability, you worry about how you look.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t break me down but kids can be quite cruel. They\u2019d say \u2018why have you got weird hands?\u2019 or \u2018why can\u2019t you walk properly?\u2019 When you\u2019re getting changed for PE you don\u2019t want to show that you\u2019ve got feet like mine.\u201d\n\nWill took to poking fun at himself before anyone else got the chance. \u201cI learned that if I took the mickey out of myself a lot, then no one else would.\u201d\n\nAgain, Chrissie was his rock. \u201cI remember speaking to Mum about it and she would say \u2018you should be proud about the way you look and the way you are \u2013 don\u2019t let anyone say you\u2019re not as good as them\u2019 and I kind of believed her.\u201d\n\nIt was once Will was playing table tennis at county level aged 15 \u2013 against able-bodied opponents \u2013 that he was noticed as a potential Paralympian.\n\nWhen they first approached, he didn\u2019t think it was for him. But finally he was persuaded to give it a go.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\u201cI went to a training camp and lost every single match,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt was really hard but it made me want to play more and get better.\u201d\n\nIn the run-up to Beijing 2008, when he was 19, Will was \u201creclassified\u201d into a more able group, having previously worked his way to becoming one of the world\u2019s best.\n\n\u201cOne of the coaches said I should retire because physically it wouldn\u2019t really be possible for me to compete in the category above,\u201d he remembers. \u201cIt was tough \u2013 I lost every single match in Beijing 2008 and went from being number five in the world to number 57.\u201d\n\nWill trained for six hours a day and gave up his place at the BRIT School, where he had started studying acting, in order to move to Sheffield and focus fully on London 2012.\n\nHe made it all the way to the final but was beaten by Germany\u2019s Jochen Wollmert.\n\n\u201cIt spurred me on for Rio,\u201d says Will. \u201cAfter being beaten I was really motivated to go and win the gold.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, he did just that, coming home to be awarded an MBE for his efforts, which he collected from Prince William the following year.\n\nWhen he wins, Will remembers the schoolkids and coaches who didn\u2019t believe in him. \u201cWanting to prove people wrong is a massive motivation.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us back to Strictly, for which he has had special shoes made to aid his balance.\n\n\u201cMy feet were totally back to front when I was born, because of the joints,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey had to break them and put them straight \u2013 they\u2019re covered in scars where they have been rebuilt with rods.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\u201cBut somehow now I\u2019m dancing so they must have done a good job!\u201d\n\nPaired with show favourite Janette, the couple have worked tirelessly to perfect their routines, managing scores of 24 for their salsa in week two and 23 for last weekend\u2019s paso doble.\n\nBut it was with his opening dance that Will really got everyone\u2019s attention, performing a quickstep which earned him 26 points and led judge Shirley Ballas to declare: \u201cWhat disability? What limitations? That was absolutely off the charts.\u201d\n\nSign up for our Strictly updates Love Strictly? Keep on top of all the news on and off the dancefloor with our regular email updates.

I haven\u2019t got any ankles so the rise and fall is impossible.\u201d\n\nBut Will is loving the backing he is receiving from viewers.\n\n\u201cThe support has been phenomenal \u2013 I never expected it,\u201d he marvels. \u201cI have had parents who\u2019ve written to me with children who have it in all four limbs and they\u2019ve said \u2018we weren\u2019t sure if our son or our little girl was going to be able to walk and now we\u2019re seeing someone with arthrogryposis dancing\u2019. That makes me feel good.\u201d\n\nHis own daughter, with ex-partner Fiona York, is proving harder to impress. \u201cBella has just turned two. She\u2019s amazing but when I\u2019m on TV she still wants to watch Peppa Pig .\u201d\n\nHe and actress/model Fiona have an amicable relationship despite no longer being a couple, with Will seeing Bella at weekends.\n\nOnce Strictly is over, the Paralympian has his sights set on retaining his gold medal in Tokyo next year, and he hopes to compete in Paris 2024.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that whatever medals \u2013 or glitterballs \u2013 he clinches in the future, Will is very much winning at life, every single day.\n\n*Strictly Come Dancing is on BBC1, tonight at 6:40pm.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Will Bayley is loving the reaction from Strictly Come Dancing viewers following his performances", "authors": ["Nicola Methven", "Image", "Guy Levy Bbc Pa Wire", "Instagram", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20559930.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS193442262.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
