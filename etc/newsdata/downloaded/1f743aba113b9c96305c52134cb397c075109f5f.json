Asia Naphtha/Gasoline-Naphtha extends gains; Formosa seeks cargoes\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Asia's naphtha crack rose to a three-session high of $81.68 a tonne on Wednesday, supported by solid demand.\n\n- Taiwan's Formosa, also Asia's top naphtha buyer, is looking to buy open-specification naphtha for Dec. 1-10 arrival at Mailiao in a tender but results were not immediately clear.\n\n- But the petrochemical maker's purchase price on Sept. 25 surged to a premium between $12 and $13 to its own price formula on a cost-and-freight (C&F) basis from a discount of $2 to $3 on Sept. 12 because of attacks on Saudi's oil facilities.\n\n* INVENTORIES: Japan's gasoline and naphtha stocks were down in the week to Oct. 26, while its average refinery run rates at 80% were higher vs 76.3% in the previous week, official data showed. Analysts estimated that gasoline stockpiles likely fell 2.2 million barrels last week, an extended Reuters poll showed on Tuesday. TENDERS: Saudi Arabia's Aramco Trading has won a term tender to buy about 550,000 tonnes of naphtha throughout 2020 from Greek refiner Motor Oil Hellas, three trading sources told Reuters on Tuesday. Egypt offered up to 38,500 tonnes of naphtha for December-loading from Suez through a tender due to be awarded on Nov. 14.\n\n- Industry sources said the bulk of Egypt's Suez naphtha cargoes scheduled for 2019 loading went to Aramco but this could not be directly confirmed. NAP/TENDA\n\n* OTHER NEWS: Indonesia's PT Pertamina Rosneft Pengolahan dan Petrokimia, a JV between state oil company PT Pertamina and Russia's PJSC Rosneft Oil Co, has appointed Spanish Tecnicas Reunidas SA to conduct engineering design for its Tuban refinery and petrochemical project.\n\n- The Tuban project, targeted to be operational in 2025, is among Pertamina's six priority projects that would double its refining capacity.
