People were allowed in again on Friday morning.\n\n\u201cI express my admiration and tenderness for the last of the great presidents,\u201d read one tribute. \u201cThank you for fighting, thank you for this freedom and good spirits.\n\nA ceremony for members of the public will be held on Sunday at the Invalides memorial complex in Paris, the \u00c9lys\u00e9e and his family announced. This will be followed by a day of national mourning on Monday when a commemorative service will be held at the Saint Sulpice church in the Saint-Germain-des-Pres area of central Paris.\n\nThe former prime minister, mayor of Paris and president will then be buried in the Montparnasse cemetery in a private ceremony, said Chirac\u2019s son-in-law, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Salat-Baroux. Chirac will be buried next to his daughter Laurence, who died in 2016.\n\nPortraits of Chirac adorned the front pages of all France\u2019s newspapers, with Le Parisien using the headline \u201cSo French.

He suffered a stroke in 2005 and underwent kidney surgery in December 2013.\n\nChirac had always extolled his love of France and its modern leaders paid tribute above all to a man who had represented the values and symbols of his country.\n\nJacques Chirac obituary Read more\n\n\u201cAs a leader who was able to represent the nation in its diversity and complexity\u2026 President Chirac embodied a certain idea of France,\u201d said Macron, recalling how Chirac had himself paid an eloquent tribute to his old foe Mitterrand when he died in 1996.\n\nMacron cited in particular Chirac\u2019s foreign policy choices, notably for refusing to take France to war in 2003 in the US-led invasion of Iraq without a UN mandate.\n\nHe said Chirac was being mourned \u201cnot just across our own country\u201d and that he had led an \u201cindependent and proud France, capable of rising up against an unjustified military intervention\u201d.", "description": "Presidential palace opened to the public to sign book of condolence for ex-president", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7164546c9031fc149f9e85f37b03f80a98f0457a/0_653_5420_3253/master/5420.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c50189cf0364e4c31e4c09a1cacea997", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
