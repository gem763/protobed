He opposed 'no resistance' to his arrest, according to French newspaper Le Parisien, which broke the news.\n\nThe murders, known as the \"Nantes slaughter\", deeply shocked France at the time. Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s had disappeared before his family's bodies were found, and the murders had never been solved.\n\nBefore the murders, Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s had told neighbours and his children's schools that he was a secret agent and that the family was leaving to join a witness protection scheme.\n\nHe was last seen in April 2011, appearing on the 14th on a CCTV video as he withdrew money, and on the 15th as he left a hotel. His wife and children's bodies were discovered six days later.\n\nHis arrest followed an \"anonymous denunciation\", AFP reported.", "description": "Xavier Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s, a Frenchman who is suspected to have killed his entire family in 2011 and has been on the run since, was arrested in Glasgow on Friday, AFP reported, citing police sources.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/50/42/1000x563_cmsv2_a6f02d8c-1a5e-5a8d-b5b4-de40ee010989-4225042.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
