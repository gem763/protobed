The investigator did further research into the book\u2019s publisher and discovered \u201ca typical contract would include payments of $10,000 to $20,000 as advances against later royalties,\u201d according to documents.\n\nAD\n\nAt this time, Dolezal had been reporting a monthly income of less than $500, which came from child support payments. She resigned from the NAACP in June 2015 when her parents revealed she was actually white, and claimed that since then she had been unemployed and unable to find work, the Spokesman-Review reported.\n\nWhen asked how she was paying her living expenses, she was quoted in the documents saying, \u201cBarely! With help from friends and gifts.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut, a review of Dolezal\u2019s self-employment records, which included bank statements, revealed a less dire situation.\n\nIn total, between August 2015 and September 2017, Dolezal\u2019s bank statements showed she had deposited nearly $84,000, documents said. Investigators believe the money came from her book, speaking engagements and selling art, soaps and handmade dolls.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2017, Dolezal reported a \u201cchange of circumstance,\u201d citing a \u201cone-time job\u201d for \u201cspeaking and voice overs\u201d she did in October that earned her $20,000, according to documents.\n\nDocuments show Dolezal was made aware that she would be criminally prosecuted if she \u201cwillfully\u201d made a false statement or failed to report things.\n\nAD\n\nDolezal was called in for an interview with an investigator in April during which she was informed that the investigation was about her \u201cdiscrepancies in reporting.\u201d Dolezal responded that she had \u201cfully disclosed her information and asked what discrepancies,\u201d the investigator said.\n\nThen, Dolezal reportedly told the investigator that \u201cshe did not have to answer,\u201d cutting the interview short.\n\nRefusing to answer questions has proved to not be a good defense for Dolezal.\n\nDolezal\u2019s story of posing as an African American captured headlines in 2015.\n\nAD\n\nShe was outed as pretending to be African American after her carefully constructed image was shattered during an interview in 2015 when she was asked a single question: \u201cAre you an African American?\u201d Dolezal did not answer and instead walked off-camera.\n\nAD\n\nDolezal is the subject of a Netflix documentary called \u201cThe Rachel Divide,\u201d which was released in April. According to a statement from Netflix, she was not paid for the project.\n\nIf found guilty, Dolezal could face up to 15 years in prison and could be ordered to pay $8,887 as restitution. She may also be disqualified from receiving food assistance for at least a year, documents said.\n\nDolezal is expected to appear in court on June 6, KHQ-TV reported.\n\nAD", "description": "Dolezal changed her name after being exposed as a white woman claiming to be black while serving as an NAACP official.", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EDBcET_beG5eToA5zzrVQoichCY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7ML75TLOHU54THUKY45VX6CK3M.jpg", "published_at": "2018-05-25"}
