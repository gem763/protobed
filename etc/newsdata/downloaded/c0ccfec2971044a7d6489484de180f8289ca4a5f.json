REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde\n\nABUJA (Reuters) - A Nigerian election tribunal on Wednesday rejected a bid by the main opposition candidate to overturn the February presidential election.\n\nThe widely expected defeat for opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar means there is no further challenge to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s re-election. The 76-year-old former military ruler first took office as an elected leader in 2015.\n\nThe tribunal rejected all three of Atiku\u2019s claims: that the election was marred by irregularities, that he received more votes than Buhari and that the president did not have a secondary school certificate, a basic requirement to contest the election.\n\n\u201cThis petition is hereby dismissed in its entirety,\u201d Justice Mohammed Lawal Garba said in announcing the ruling.\n\nEvery election result has been contested since Nigeria returned to democracy in 1999, with the exception of the 2015 poll in which Goodluck Jonathan conceded defeat to Buhari.", "description": "A Nigerian election tribunal on Wednesday rejected a bid by the main opposition candidate to overturn the February presidential election.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428761209&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1I0-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
