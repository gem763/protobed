Pochettino has spoken before about the moment when Michael Owen tumbled under his challenge to win a penalty for England, which David Beckham scored to condemn Argentina to a 1-0 defeat in the second group game.\n\nThere has been a slightly jokey edge to Pochettino\u2019s comments, which essentially distil into his contention that Owen had dived. How can England claim to be the home of fair play?! His audience have normally laughed along, throwing in a few retorts about cynical Argentinian defenders. But until now nobody in England has realised how badly it affected him.\n\n\u201cIt was always my massive dream to play in a World Cup and OK, we played but three [group] games and we went home,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cThere was the penalty with Owen. For three or four years we had been unbeaten but we arrived in circumstances that were the worst and we were out in the group stage. I closed myself away in my room and I didn\u2019t go out for 10 days.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mauricio Pochettino talks to his players before the penalty shootout at Colchester, which Tottenham would lose.

He had been desperate to win his first trophy as a manager and, after the unexpected and epic run to the final, he could almost touch the ultimate prize. It simply made what happened next \u2013 the strangely flat performance from his players \u2013 even more difficult to bear.\n\nColchester\u2019s Luke Prosser: \u2018My family are Spurs and they were going mad\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cIt was more than a dream [to win] and I felt so disappointed,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI took a train to Barcelona [where he has a house] the day after and, again, you are like depressed.\u201d\n\nThe new season has been testing for Pochettino and Spurs, scarred by the home defeat by Newcastle and the throwing away of leads at Arsenal, Olympiakos and Leicester, which brought two draws and a defeat, respectively. After Colchester, the team\u2019s record shows only two wins from eight games. Yet Pochettino has been through worse. He even said that the early months of his first season at Spurs were tougher than what he is currently enduring.\n\nIt was Pochettino\u2019s day to put on a show of defiance, to summon perspective and get his messages across away from the prickly heat of a post-match press conference. He spoke for almost 50 minutes, sometimes switching into Spanish to ensure clarity, and it added up to a rallying cry which he hopes can spark an upturn, beginning at home to Southampton.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nAs previously the discussion was framed by the internal politics of the summer, taking in recruitment and the desire of a clutch of players to leave. It had been the same story in the summer of 2018. This time there was intense speculation over Christian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen \u2013 each of whom has now entered the final year on his contract \u2013 plus Danny Rose, Serge Aurier and Victor Wanyama. In the end all six stayed.\n\nCarabao Cup shocks and the death of Sahar Khodayari \u2013 Football Weekly Extra Read more\n\nPochettino argued the distractions had gravely undermined the club until the closure of the European transfer window on 2 September and it was wrong to expect the players would be able to refocus in the blink of an eye; that the togetherness of the squad would instantly return to normal. But he stressed he would do everything possible to fix what he called the collateral damage. \u201cNothing is completely broken,\u201d Pochettino said, with regard to relationships within the squad. \u201cIt\u2019s just that sometimes, temporarily, the mindset can change and then to get back on track takes time or solutions. It\u2019s only been three weeks [since the European window closed]. Your circumstances and your mental preparation as an athlete don\u2019t just change overnight.\u201d\n\nIt was put to Pochettino that with the stadium move having been completed and three new faces added to the squad, the club might appear better off when compared to last season, when they were renting Wembley until April and made no signings.\n\n\u201cWho says that?\u201d Pochettino replied, his opposition to the idea plain. \u201cChallenges appear, personal circumstances appear. It doesn\u2019t mean more names make a better team. It doesn\u2019t follow that, if you have a \u00a31.2bn stadium, you will win more games. Football is not an ordinary business. Ninety-nine per cent of the time two plus two is not four. That is why football is so complex and why a lot of managers are sacked.\u201d\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nPochettino made the point that nobody is the same after they play a Champions League final. \u201cThe perception and expectation is different,\u201d he said. \u201cIt creates a new circumstance for the club which is different again and we need to find a solution.\u201d\n\nFootball League rejects proposal to readmit Bury into League Two Read more\n\nThe most pressing matter on the field is the team\u2019s lack of pressing. \u201cCollectively, we need to press better,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI was talking with some players \u2013 it\u2019s like when you go with friends to play five-a-side. No one wants to go in goal. You want to play with the ball. You don\u2019t want to be chasing people and running in behind. Maybe we lose this balance.\n\n\u201cThere is another part to the game \u2013 having the will to recover the ball, this aggressivity, and we drop a little bit in this collectively. This is the key point we need to fix.\u201d\n\nPochettino argued the team\u2019s performances were \u201cnot as bad as the feeling and atmosphere that we create\u201d and, ever self-assured, he remains convinced that Spurs can take the most difficult final step to silverware with him.\n\n\u201cI believe and hope this, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf not, you are going to see quickly.\u201d", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham\u2019s manager, opens up on Champions League and World Cup agony after his side\u2019s uncertain start to the season that has yielded two wins from eight games", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d0839f0f00532b7971332ef2561566436aef7b5/438_148_2588_1553/master/2588.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d6c1c949ca92a7534c969c90a9646035", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
