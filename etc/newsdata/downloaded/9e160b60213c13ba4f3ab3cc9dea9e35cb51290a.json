These designers want the trend to die.", "language": "en", "text": "Helen Parker, creative director of deVOL kitchens, has similar warm memories of this once-essential piece of furniture: \u201cMy dad would sit at the kitchen table and get out books, or look at stamps and use it as a place to continue hanging out; it was so much more than just a place to eat,\u201d she says.\n\nLately, a handful of designers and tastemakers are embracing the old-fashioned table as a homier alternative to the ubiquitous island. Cabinetry companies such as deVOL and Plain English have launched U.S. showrooms to an overwhelmingly positive response in the past year, and their advertising often features images of kitchens with tables front and center. The spaces present a cozy and inviting antidote to overly sleek kitchens with tricked-out islands. There\u2019s a reason that \u201cgathered around the island\u201d doesn\u2019t have the same nostalgic ring as \u201cgathered around the table.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA table has a domestic warmth to it that an island doesn\u2019t,\u201d says New York interior designer Steven Gambrel. \u201cThe way a casual outfit encourages a laid-back vibe and black-tie dress creates a formal tone, the same is true of an island,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen an island is built-in and matches the cabinets, it has a stiff, immobile presence. It doesn\u2019t have the same sense of ease as a wooden table that\u2019s got some age.\u201d\n\nFor Parker, adding a vintage table is a way to create a more authentic, eclectic vibe. \u201cAll of those matching parts don\u2019t feel as soulful as when you have great big table with a bunch of flowers where the kids can do their homework,\u201d she says.\n\nGambrel also cites lightness as a part of a table\u2019s appeal. \u201cYour eye sees under a table because the legs raise it off the ground; it feels more airy and less contrived than an island, which can feel bulky and dated,\u201d he says. Part of the problem in Parker\u2019s opinion is the temptation for homeowners to fit everything and the kitchen sink into the island. \u201cIt\u2019s become a big box with too many appliances, stools, and a garbage bin; it ends up not being an aesthetically pleasing piece of furniture,\u201d she says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the fully loaded island has a tight grip on America\u2019s imagination. When people talk about the heart of the kitchen today, they\u2019re often referring to this multifunctional monolith. A recent Houzz survey estimated that 38 percent of kitchen remodels involved adding an island (that doesn\u2019t include all of the homes that already have one). Some trend forecasters even predict that we\u2019ll see a rise in the popularity of double islands in future years.\n\nAccording to Home Advisor, the average cost of a kitchen island is $3,000 to $5,000, though custom-built options can be $10,000 or more. Of course, not every kitchen can accommodate a built-in island. For older houses with small or galley-style cookspaces, planning for an island involves opening up a wall or bumping out the back, which can increase renovation costs dramatically. In these situations, a small- to medium-size table can be a practical and affordable solution, offering comparable prep space. A solid pine table from Ikea will set you back just $99, while an antiqued elm one with a distressed metal base from Restoration Hardware starts at $1,095. If you\u2019re in the market for a truly unique vintage piece, 1st dibs has this Italian oak farm table with geometric inlay for $4,000.\n\nThe earliest islands were humble work tables placed in the center of the kitchen. If you were wealthy, it was where servants orchestrated dinner \u2014 think of the downstairs buzz of Downton Abbey. If you weren\u2019t, it was where you sat to peel potatoes or roll out pie crust, often in solitude, because the kitchen was probably cut off from the rest of the house. It wasn\u2019t until the mid-20th century that the open kitchen and built-in island arrived, promising to make women\u2019s lives easier.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe iconic suburban image of the command-post kitchen where the woman of the house could do her work and observe the kids really resonated in 1950s America,\u201d says Sarah Leavitt, curator at the National Building Museum. \u201cThe idea was to build this concept of family and togetherness right into the actual architecture and design of the house.\u201d\n\nWhile the island was an aspirational symbol of modern housekeeping, it was mostly a product of postwar new construction for suburban single-family homes. It gained momentum through the 1960s and \u201970s, but it didn\u2019t become a mainstream design element until the 1980s and \u201990s, when open-plan kitchens became the rage, buoyed by the popularity of the Food Network and HGTV.\n\nSuddenly, the island wasn\u2019t just a prep space, but also a stage to perform for your guests, though visibility has its drawbacks. \u201cIf you have a big island that\u2019s open to the rest of the house and you\u2019re trying to sit in the living room, you\u2019re likely staring at dirty dishes,\u201d Leavitt says. \u201cIt looks nice when it\u2019s clean, but given the potential for mess it\u2019s surprising that it continues to have widespread appeal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of the ironies of the island is that it\u2019s come to epitomize casual living, yet bellying up to one isn\u2019t always easy or comfortable. A counter-height stool often lacks adequate support for longer stretches of sitting. \u201cThere\u2019s just something nicer about relaxing into a proper chair and being able to spread out at a table,\u201d Parker says.\n\nAnother downside: Breakfast bar-style seating often forces everyone to eat facing the same direction \u2014 fine for a quick bite on-the-go, but not exactly great for connecting with each other. \u201cIf you have a big island, as soon as the meal is over, everyone disperses; you don\u2019t quite congregate in the same way,\u201d she says.\n\nIslands also tend to put guests on one side, leaving the person doing the work standing alone on the other, which can sometimes feel like an imbalance of power. At a communal table, everyone can pull up a chair and occupy equal space.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of, \u2018Why does one thing feel good and not the other?\u2019 And it comes down to being honest about the way we actually live vs. the way we think we should live,\u201d Gambrel says. \u201cWhen you experience an easy house where someone likes to cook and entertain, and they serve you coffee at the table and there\u2019s music playing, it resonates with you; naturally, you\u2019d want to emulate that.\u201d\n\nMore from Lifestyle:\n\nAD", "description": "Tastemakers are embracing the old-fashioned table as a homier alternative.", "authors": ["Michelle Brunner"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IYU6sMy_xoJxKPI3iaXHk_r38Vg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/65V2AUHVCEI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
