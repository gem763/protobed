Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang also spoke at the event.\n\n\"We are in the fight of our lives,\" Steyer stated. \"Everything is on the table in 2020. They think so too, because they think if they lose in 2020, the rules are going to be fair and they're never going to win again. And they're right. If we win in 2020, they're done forever. But it's scary for us, too, because if they win, literally it could be the end of the world.\"\n\nSteyer, who has openly been calling for impeachment since he founded Need To Impeach in October 2017, will participate in Tuesday's presidential debate.
