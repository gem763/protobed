(Screenshot: G/O Media)\n\nWe often talk about how women get treated differently or are represented less in the car and motorsports industries\u2014things that have long catered (and often still do) to the man\u2019s man. But in 2019, more and more women are involved in it than ever, to say nothing of how we\u2019re half of all drivers and most of the new car buyers. No matter what we do, some of that regressive attitude remains, and those of us who don\u2019t fit the mould get targeted because of it.\n\nFor those of us who work in and around cars, the hate and harassment comes at work, where we should just be able to clock in, do our jobs, and clock out, without all of that.\n\nIf you want to know what that feels like, or if you want to be a part of changing that for the better, maybe give this a listen.\n\nOur friend David Obuchowski, whose \u201cTempest\u201d podcast began right here on Jalopnik and continued for a second season on Acast, wanted to talk about those experiences\u2014the experiences of women who write, produce videos and do other public work in the car industry, including myself\u2014for this season\u2019s finale.\n\nWhen David emailed to ask about some of the hate mail, nasty comments, and general harassment I\u2019d received in my career for the episode, my first thought was whether he had all day, or maybe even a week. It\u2019s no secret that it can be pretty terrible to be a woman on the internet, no matter what you do.\n\nBut we managed to keep the talk down to a couple of hours, and there was obvious surprise in David\u2019s reactions at just how bad some of the stuff was. I\u2019m sure that was the case with the other women he talked to as well: Jodi Lai, the Editor in Chief of autotrader.ca; Stef Schrader, a longtime auto writer whose work can be found here and at a plethora of other automotive sites; Kristen Lee, my colleague at Jalopnik; and Deb Lee, from the Andie the Lab YouTube channel.\n\nI, like everyone else, heard the episode when it published, and the setup made it that much more powerful. David began with various male writers and producers in the car industry, asking them the basic question of whether anyone had ever disagreed with their writing. Yes, they said, but David followed up: \u201cHow many of these emails, tweets, comments brought their gender into it?\u201d None.\n\nThen, David came to us. We all read a selection of things we\u2019d been sent or dealt with in person, which range from hate to harassment. But like David mentions, it would\u2019ve taken ages to include them all. He highlighted a small selection to convey the general idea, and we all related them to the bigger issue in the car industry\u2014that for us, the bar is different and the experiences are as well.\n\nIt should be said that I\u2019ve learned to laugh the emails and comments off and compartmentalise my anger at the general climate of cars, because if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be mad all the time, and that\u2019s no way to live.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth being angry about because there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done to make cars\u2014and every other crevice of the world\u2014a kinder and more inclusive place. That starts with understanding the experiences of others, and if you want to know more about the experiences of the women whose automotive work you might read or watch regularly, this episode of Tempest, embedded above and also available here, is a great place to start.", "description": "We often talk about how\u00a0women get treated\u00a0differently or are represented less in the car and motorsports industries\u2014things that have long catered (and often still do) to the man\u2019s man.
