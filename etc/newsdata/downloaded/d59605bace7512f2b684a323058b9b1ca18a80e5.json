That only means playoff races will start to heat up, in earnest, now that it\u2019s almost November.\n\nHere are the winners and losers at the halfway point of the 2019 NFL season.\n\nWINNERS\n\nRoad teams: Maybe it\u2019s time we soften the stance on the importance of home-field advantage. Through Week 8, road teams are above .500, with an overall record of 63-57-1. That\u2019s the most road victories through eight weeks in NFL history. Only five teams \u2014 the Patriots, the Vikings, the 49ers, and the Saints \u2014 are undefeated at home. Five teams \u2014 the Buccaneers, Redskins, Bengals, Browns, and Dolphins \u2014 have yet to win a game at home. According to the NFL, only five seasons have taken place in which road teams have finished with a winning record, though none of them have happened since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers: Pretty much everyone expects the Patriots to be among the best-coached and most efficient teams year in and year out. But the Niners have been one of the biggest surprises so far, remaining the only other undefeated team in football at 7-0, side by side with New England. Coach Kyle Shanahan is a brilliant offensive mind and has the 49ers dominating in rushing yards a game (181.1) and time of possession (34:31), both of which are second-best in the league. Another winner has to be defensive end Robert Saleh, who looks like he\u2019s auditioning for a head coaching gig soon. He\u2019s leading San Francisco\u2019s defense to new heights, and has rookie defensive end Nick Bosa (20 tackles, seven sacks, one interception, one forced fumble) playing like a candidate for defensive player of the year.\n\nWide-open MVP race: It seems like the consensus for the player who most deserves the most valuable player award changes each week. At varying times, quarterbacks Aaron Rodgers (Packers), Deshaun Watson (Texans), Lamar Jackson (Ravens), Russell Wilson (Seahawks), Dak Prescott (Cowboys) and Patrick Mahomes (Chiefs) each had a legitimate argument. Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey and Saints receiver Michael Thomas are getting some love in the conversation, too. It\u2019s almost as if each player is trying to one-up the field, and it has been fun to watch.\n\nNFL TRADE WINNERS, LOSERS:Who missed opportunities at deadline?\n\nTHEY REALLY PLAY THERE? 100 star players who played for teams you forgot about\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER:Sign up to get football news, analysis delivered to your inbox\n\nSean Payton: This year \u2014 with quarterback Drew Brees (thumb) and running back Alvin Kamara (ankle) missing time with injuries \u2014 has reinforced that Payton is one of the better coaches in the NFL, and a master game-planner. In particular, Payton altered his offense from week to week when backup Teddy Bridgewater was starting \u2014 at times emphasizing short, accurate throws and at others shifting to a dominant, physical rushing attack. Now that New Orleans is getting healthy, the Saints (7-1) are primed for a playoff run and Payton might be in line for coach of the year honors.\n\nMiami Dolphins: Yes, it\u2019s curious to put a team that has yet to win a game on a list of winners, but Miami lands here because it has stuck to the plan to raze the organization and completely rebuild. The Dolphins have steadily been packaging veteran players in exchange for draft capital. And yes, they\u2019ll eventually need to hit on their picks, but the franchise is executing the rebuild as it should. Every personnel decision the team has made has been made with the future in mind. The coaches are trying to maintain a competitive atmosphere, but the roster simply isn\u2019t good enough. That\u2019s by design. Look instead at the Jets, Redskins, Bengals and Falcons \u2014 teams who thought they\u2019d compete in 2019, but now face difficult overhauls. Those teams face an uphill battle while Miami is steps ahead.\n\nLOSERS\n\nPass interference rule: The rule that coaches could challenge pass interference calls brought optimism that the league would be taking legitimate steps to correct the inconsistency associated with the enforcement of fouls. The problem has been that the rule change has been mostly for show. Just this past weekend, only the second successful pass interference challenge was overturned, despite there being well more than 20 challenges. In many cases, there appeared to be a clear case of a foul. That\u2019s why the league used the \u201cclear and obvious\u201d language when it crafted the rule. Coaches should use the first half of the season as an indication that unless a player gets Tommylee Lewis\u2019ed like the Saints did in the NFC Championship Game, they should hold onto their red challenge flags. Because the clear message is that unless it\u2019s an egregious case, it\u2019s going to be a waste of a timeout.\n\nRookie coaches not named LaFleur and Kingsbury: Aside from Matt LaFleur, the coach of the 7-1 Packers, and Kliff Kingsbury, the coach of the 3-4-1, but surprisingly competitive Cardinals, it has been rough for rookie coaches. Brian Flores (Dolphins), Zac Taylor (Bengals), Vic Fangio (Broncos) and Freddie Kitchens (Browns) have combined for a 4-26 record through Week 8 this year. Two of those teams, Miami and Cincinnati, are winless and in the middle of complete rebuilds. Throw in Denver, and it\u2019s safe to expect multiple years before any of them are legitimately competitive in their divisions. The Browns are a different case in that they have young talent at key positions and have fallen well below of expectations. Their schedule does lighten and become easier so Cleveland should \u2014 in theory \u2014 improve. But there\u2019s no other way to paint the start of the season in Cleveland than as a letdown.\n\nPlace kickers: If it seems like it has been a bad year for kickers in the NFL, it\u2019s because it has. This season has seen the highest number of missed combined kicks (field goals and extra points) through Week 8 since 1985 with 121 misfires. That mark is 12 more than the 109 that happened through eight weeks in both 2001 and 2017. It says a lot that even long-time kickers are going through troubles. Matt Bryant was just released from the Falcons on Tuesday and Adam Vinatieri has battled inconsistency with the Colts.\n\nTeams who won the offseason: This is geared toward the Browns and the Jets. Cleveland made a splash by adding receiver Odell Beckham Jr., edge rusher Olivier Vernon and defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson among others, and the Jets signed running back Le\u2019Veon Bell, linebacker C.J. Mosley and receiver Jamison Crowder. Instead of seeing the infusion of talent gelling right away, both teams have sputtered. The Jets have dealt with injuries, but Bell\u2019s production just isn\u2019t there. And Cleveland added all those players, but didn\u2019t fix its offensive line, and turnovers and unforced errors like penalties remain serious issues. This is yet another reason why the Patriots are so successful; they make quiet, but calculated decisions in free agency and don\u2019t feel the need to overpay.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers: This was a team many were expecting to compete for a Super Bowl. They have their veteran quarterback in place in Philip Rivers. They have dynamic skill position players. They have a stout defense that has star talent like defensive end Joey Bosa. Yet, the Chargers are 3-5 and in third place in the AFC West, and worst yet, they\u2019re 2-4 in the conference. They just fired Ken Whisenhunt as their offensive coordinator after struggled to gain traction in the rushing game and tied for 24th in red zone conversion rate (48.15%) and 29th in goal-to-go conversion rate (46.15%). The good news is that the Chargers have only played one division game, losing it to the Broncos. That means that if the Chargers can get hot and rip off some victories against division foes, they could get back in the playoff picture.\n\nRedskins and Bengals: They both have stars that reportedly want to play elsewhere in offensive tackle Trent Williams for Washington and receiver A.J. Green for Cincinnati. Green (ankle injury) will become an unrestricted free agent at the end of this season. Williams (holdout) has the rest of this season and the next left on his contract now that he reported to the squad. But rather than to trade the players and recoup some draft capital to help their rebuilds, they closed themselves off to the possibility. In the end, that hurt both team and player.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
