USA TODAY\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. \u2013 It didn't matter to the Eagles that the winds were howling, with gusts well over 30 mph.\n\nOr that one of their running backs, Miles Sanders, who scored on a 65-yard run, left the game with an injury on a crucial day for running backs.\n\nThey needed a victory, and it didn't matter how it looked.\n\nSo on a day when passes either died in the wind or sailed heading the other direction, where extra point attempts were an adventure, and when the deep pass was pretty much taken out of the equation, the Eagles found a way for a 31-13 win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\n\nThey improved to 4-4 heading into the NFL's trade deadline on Tuesday.\n\nBefore Sanders left with a shoulder injury, he had 74 yards on 3 carries after coming into the game averaging just 3.5 yards per rush, and he had 44 yards receiving on 3 receptions.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles' Miles Sanders (26), center, breaks through the Buffalo Bills defense to score a touchdown during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Oct. 27, 2019, in Orchard Park, N.Y. (Photo: Adrian Kraus, AP)\n\nBut Jordan Howard powered his way to 96 yards rushing on 23 carries. Boston Scott, filling in for both Sanders and Howard late in the third quarter, scored on a 4-yard TD run.\n\nAnd Carson Wentz, who only tried one deep ball, completing it for 38 yards to Alshon Jeffery in the third quarter, played mistake-free in the conditions. He completed 17 of 24 passes for 172 yards and a touchdown. He also ran for 37 yards.\n\n\"It was a huge win for,\" said Wentz. \"To come out here on the road and play like we did and scratch and claw like we did and come away with a victory, it really feels good.\"\n\nThe Eagles needed all of it after a tumultuous week in whichveteran Orlando Scandrick ripped the team three days after being released.\n\nIt was the Eagles' third consecutive road game, coming against a Bills team that came in with a 5-1 record and allowing just 91 yards rushing a game, and just 15.2 points a game.\n\nThe Eagles ran for 218 yards.\n\nThey earned every yard. The winds were blowing at 23 mph when the game started, with gusts above 35 mph.\n\nKicking, punting follies\n\nEagles coach Doug Pederson made an interesting decision when the Eagles scored just before halftime.\n\nAt the time, the Eagles were down 7-3, so the extra point, as is convention, would have given them a three-point lead. But Pederson called a timeout and decided against trying essentially a 33-yard attempt into the wind.\n\nSanders ran the ball in from the 2, and the Eagles had an 11-7 lead with 25 seconds left.\n\nThe Eagles, going toward the other end, then tried a PAT after scoring in the third quarter. This time, Elliott's attempt hit the crossbar.\n\nThe Bills scored later in the period, and the PAT into the wind was blocked by Derek Barnett.\n\nBoston Scott 1st career TD\n\nThe Eagles were at the Bills' 4-yard line late in the third quarter. But neither Howard nor Sanders were available. Sanders hurt his shoulder on a previous play and was headed to the locker room. Howard appeared to be hurt too, although he returned later in the quarter.\n\nSo the Eagles brought in an extra lineman in Halapoulivaati Vaitai, and Boston Scott took the handoff up the middle for his first career touchdown. That gave the Eagles a 24-13 lead with 5:38 left in the third quarter.\n\nScott began the season on the practice squad. He was promoted to the 53-man roster on Oct. 11.\n\nDarby returns, starts\n\nOn defense, cornerback Ronald Darby started with Jalen Mills, marking the first time in more than a year that the two have started together.\n\nSidney Jones played some at nickel following the release of Orlando Scandrick, who then ripped the team on Friday on a national TV show.\n\nAs for defensive tackle, the Eagles rotated in three players who were on practice squads last week next to Fletcher Cox in Anthony Rush, Albert Huggins and Bruce Hector.\n\nCox, however, started the game out strong with a strip-sack on Allen (the Bills recovered) and a tackle for loss.", "description": "It was the Eagles'\u00a0third consecutive\u00a0road game, coming against a Bills team that came in with a 5-1 record and allowing just 15.2 points a\u00a0game.", "authors": ["Martin Frank", "Published P.M.
