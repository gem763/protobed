Meanwhile, the whistle-blower\u2019s lawyer says his life may be in danger and there\u2019s an online push to identify him, even as the president says he wants to meet the CIA officer who was guaranteed anonymity under the law.\n\nPLOT TWIST? WHISTLEBLOWER SAYS TRUMP AIDES DISTURBED BY UKRAINE CALL\n\nThings are getting ugly, and we haven\u2019t even had the first hearing (because the House refused to interrupt a two-week vacation after declaring Trump a threat to democracy). Nancy Pelosi, concerned that Democrats are appearing overly eager, says she is \u201cheartbroken\u201d during this \u201csad\u201d time for our country.\n\nBut even some of Trump\u2019s harshest critics are starting to say that impeachment is a lousy idea. It\u2019s not based on some lofty notion of bringing the country together. No, it\u2019s an argument that the Democrats are making a spectacularly bad judgment that increases the chances their nemesis will remain in office.\n\nDavid Brooks, the moderately conservative New York Times columnist, has denounced Trump in harshly personal terms from the beginning. He contends in the very first sentence that Donald Trump committed an impeachable offense in raising Joe Biden and Democratic hacking with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nBut, he says, that doesn\u2019t mean the House has to impeach him.\n\nBrooks\u2019 opening bid is the most obvious one: impeachment won\u2019t work. It would take 20 Republican defections for the Senate to convict Trump, that\u2019s not going to happen, and he\u2019ll declare himself vindicated.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nBut here\u2019s the intriguing part: \u201cThis is completely elitist. We\u2019re in the middle of an election campaign. If Democrats proceed with the impeachment process, it will happen amid candidate debates, primaries and caucuses.\n\n\u201cElections give millions and millions of Americans a voice in selecting the president. This process gives 100 mostly millionaire senators a voice in selecting the president. People will conclude that Democrats are going ahead with impeachment in an election year because they don\u2019t trust the democratic process to yield the right outcome.\u201d\n\nTouche.\n\nWith the Nixon and Clinton impeachment efforts, both presidents were in their second term; there was no other way to remove them. But Trump faces the voters in a little over a year. If the Democratic nominee beats him, that person has a mandate. But a successful impeachment overturns the last election, and for a reason\u2014the Ukraine call\u2014that roughly half the country will never accept.\n\nThere\u2019s more. As I\u2019ve argued, impeachment is such a dominant story that it drains the oxygen from most Democratic candidates (with the obvious exception of Biden). \u201cThere\u2019s only so much airtime and people are getting tired of the campaign,\u201d analyst Larry Sabato told me Sunday on \u201cMedia Buzz.\u201d\n\nBrooks also makes the case that impeachment shifts the case onto Trump\u2019s turf. \u201cHe\u2019s good at one thing: waging reality TV personality wars against coastal elites,\u201d the columnist writes. \u201cSo now over the next few months he gets to have a personality war against Nancy Pelosi and Jerrold Nadler.\u201d\n\nActually Adam Schiff, but the point still applies.\n\nSupport for an impeachment inquiry is ticking up in the polls, but the fallout will be substantial. Pelosi held out for months, saying any impeachment had to be bipartisan. That hasn\u2019t happened, so now, bowing to her progressive wing, the speaker says she only insisted they should try to be bipartisan.\n\nIt would be ironic if in their zeal for impeachment, the Democrats wound up forfeiting their chance to get rid of a president the old-fashioned way.", "description": "The Democratic impeachment drive is obviously gaining momentum, and it\u2019s hard to see how the \u201cinquiry\u201d won\u2019t lead to a one-party vote to remove Donald Trump from office.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/30/694940094001_6090749685001_6090742648001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
