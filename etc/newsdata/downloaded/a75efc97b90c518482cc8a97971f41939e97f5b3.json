With the NHL-ready roster on Wednesday matching the 3-0 defeat the Marlies handed Montreal earlier in the week, the Leafs completed the home-and-home preseason sweep of the Canadiens in what might be the first and last test run for the lineup Mike Babcock will unveil on opening night.\n\nHere are two points from the win:\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLeafs look ready. Mandatory Credit: John E. Sokolowski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFirst Point: Matthews news blindsided Dubas\n\nWith the closest thing to an opening-night simulation, Wednesday\u2019s win produced many talking points from a hockey standpoint. What happened on the ice, however, instantly became secondary the moment Kyle Dubas emerged in the dressing room to formally address the disorderly conduct charge laid against Auston Matthews.\n\nAfter Matthews admitted that he didn\u2019t divulge the information with the Leafs \u2014 calling it \u201can error in judgement\u201d in his post-game media session \u2014 Dubas revealed that he heard about the news the same way most did: on Twitter.\n\nDubas said he called Matthews immediately after finding out, and the two had the first of what promises to be many direct conversations moving forward.\n\n\u201cHe was very honest about it,\u201d Dubas said. \u201cNo denying anything. He was very honest with me about what had happened. I would have liked to have known before, but I\u2019m happy in the moment when he could have ducked away or deferred that he was honest with me.\u201d\n\nDubas echoed the support from Matthews\u2019 teammates and coach Mike Babcock, suggesting the Leafs will learn and improve from the incident.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhen someone doesn\u2019t meet the level of expectation that you have for them, or (they) have for themselves, it\u2019s an opportunity for them to learn and to grow,\u201d Dubas said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how we\u2019ll approach it.\u201d\n\nAsked about whether or not the incident will impact the Maple Leafs\u2019 decision to name a captain, Dubas said it wasn\u2019t time to address the matter.\n\nSecond Point: These Leafs look ready\n\nSo these are the Toronto Maple Leafs, huh?\n\nYes, Montreal iced an incomplete roster and yes, two normally-reviewable plays that could have swung the scoreline in a different direction weren\u2019t examined under the microscope because the NHL war room wasn\u2019t up and running tonight for whatever reason. But the Leafs, fully operational for the first time in the preseason, looked dominant, comfortable and, most importantly, ready for the regular season through their performance Wednesday night.\n\nToronto submitted two 65-plus-percent possession periods and nearly doubled the Canadiens in shots with 49 placed on Kieth Kinkaid. Morgan Rielly and Auston Matthews logged big minutes, the power play converted, and each of the lines continued to look more and more comfortable.\n\nPlayers like Tyson Barrie and Alexander Kerfoot, who are locked into roster positions but haven\u2019t necessarily impressed to this point, submitted their best performances, while Frederik Andersen continued to demonstrate superb preseason form with 26 saves for the shutout. The No. 1 netminder has allowed one goal across three preseason appearances.\n\nThere were standout performances from the Marlies-heavy lineup iced in the win over the Canadiens earlier in the week. But with not a single player looking out of place tonight, it\u2019s become harder to build a case for one of them to unseat a player included in Mike Babcock\u2019s NHL-ready lineup. And that includes Dmytro Timashov, who, while quiet, was mostly effective in his minutes, and even set up Martin Marincin for a high-danger look in the second period.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long and tumultuous road to the regular season following the contentious Mitch Marner contract negotiations and now the allegations brought against Matthews. Hitting the season schedule running will be the best way to minimize the noise around the team, and the Leafs seem to be ready to do just that.\n\nMore Maple Leafs coverage on Yahoo Sports", "description": "The Toronto Maple Leafs are still reeling from the Auston Matthews news, but they have the look of a team ready to silence the noise.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cyQHelOeooV.lYLyoAW5hg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05NjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/64Zdh_vX2xdIX0x1qUSkNA--~B/aD0yODEyO3c9Mzc0OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/dd8b12b0-e008-11e9-b9ff-00f4ffa60d51", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
