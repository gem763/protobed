The president found this worthy of mockery.\n\nIt was a quick peek into the president\u2019s perspective: Trump isn\u2019t just peddling bogus corruption allegations against his would-be challenger; the Republican also considers it important to let the public know about Biden\u2019s poll advantages relative to his 2020 rivals.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Politico reported on Trump\u2019s \u201cextraordinary preoccupation\u201d with the Delaware Democrat, which led the president to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to help go after Biden. It led to a follow-up report that probably didn\u2019t receive as much attention as it probably deserved.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign is preparing an avalanche of TV ads targeting Joe Biden in early primary states \u2013 its most aggressive step yet to meddle in the Democratic nomination contest. Starting this weekend, the reelection effort will air over $1 million in anti-Biden commercials in Iowa, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Nevada, according to two people familiar with the move. The spots focus on Trump\u2019s claim that the former vice president and his son engaged in corruption in Ukraine.\n\nIt matters, of course, that Team Trump\u2019s attacks are false. But taking a step back, it\u2019s the circumstances that struck me as astonishing: I\u2019m not aware of any incumbent president who\u2019s ever made a seven-figure ad buy targeting a rival party\u2019s candidate several months before the primaries even begin.\n\nThe same day as we learned about the $1 million anti-Biden ad campaign, Trump stood on the South Lawn of the White House and urged China and Ukraine to go after the Democratic candidate. A few days later, Trump encouraged Biden to quit the race.\n\nThere\u2019s no modern parallel for a sitting president appearing so publicly panicked about a possible rival, at least not this early in the election cycle.\n\nAt a certain level, the anxiety is rooted in quantitative fact. CNN\u2019s Harry Enten recently noted that he doesn\u2019t expect Biden to be the Democratic nominee, but the political analyst added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure folks appreciate how unusual Biden holding a 10+ pt lead on Trump is at this point. No incumbent since at least WWII was down by anything close to that at this point.\u201d\n\nAnd that, by all appearances, drove Trump to abuse the powers of his office and open the door to his impeachment.", "description": "There's no modern parallel for a sitting president appearing so publicly panicked about a possible rival, at least not this early in the election cycle.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_melvin_bidentrump_190924_1920x1080.jpg?itok=T7qiGCVP", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
