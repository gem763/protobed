As this article explains, what happens next is not always easy, and sometimes involves a complicated, multi-step process.\n\nIn theory, composting can create a circular economy of food: it is grown, it is eaten, the scraps are thrown out and turned into fertilizer sold to farmers, who grow more food.

In this week's episode, we're tracking those tentacles, travelling to the busy streets of India with hidden cameras.\n\nUsing pop-up warnings, search engine listings and lead lists, the scammers are becoming better at convincing potential victims their computers or smartphones have been compromised \u2014 and the only fix will cost hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars. Once they have you hooked, they control your device, possibly able to see financial, personal and medical records.\n\nCanadians who reported being victims lost a total of nearly $1 million last year. But law enforcement has largely been unable to locate and shut down the scam centres at their source.\n\nThat hasn't stopped our investigative team. We're on their trail and headed inside the office building in the middle of the night.\n\nYou can watch our latest episode on CBC Gem or YouTube\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.
