But he plays a boyfriend to at least half a million subscribers on YouTube.\n\nHe brings you gifts on Valentine\u2019s Day and soup when you\u2019re sick. He serenades you, if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. Most important, he wants to help you get a good night\u2019s sleep. Instead of counting sheep or limiting your screen time before bed, he\u2019ll talk you down for the night and tuck you in.\n\n\u201cBabe, baaaabe, what I want you to do is just take a deep breath in and a deep breath out,\u201d he says in a whisper at the beginning of a video titled \u201cLoving Boyfriend Does Your Makeup.\u201d \u201cEverything is going to be O.K. It\u2019s all right that we\u2019re going to be a little bit late to the restaurant. I called them. They said it was O.K. if we\u2019re a little bit late as long as we get there within the hour. So just calm down, I\u2019m going to be here, I\u2019m going to give you some support. I don\u2019t want you to stress, all right? I tried to get here as quickly as I could because I know you start to get really stressed in these types of situations. But don\u2019t worry because I\u2019m here now, so you don\u2019t need to worry anymore.\u201d\n\nHe proceeds to tickle the camera lens and microphone with makeup brushes, promising that you really look better without makeup, anyway.", "description": "An emergent A.S.M.R. category on YouTube involves young men role-playing romantic partners, all in service of a better night\u2019s rest.", "authors": ["Kaitlyn Wylde"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/fashion/02asmrboyfriend-1/merlin_161552553_2332da84-5f3d-424e-a8a3-6f42a0666725-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
