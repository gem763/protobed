The archive has added 2500 new MS-DOS titles for you to try out, and they are all free of charge. Here are eight of the best.\n\nThe Internet Archive Just Added 2500 Free DOS Games! As avid retro gaming fans, we bloody love the Internet Archive. It's one of the best places to access old video games straight in your browser - and it just updated its collection with thousands of DOS classics! Here's how to play. Read more\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about exactly how this is possible, the Internet Archive has a wonderful blog post that explains the process of getting these games working in a playable state. As digital historian Jason Scott writes:\n\n\u201cWhat makes the collection more than just a pile of old, now-playable games, is how it has to take head-on the problems of software preservation and history. Having an old executable and a scanned copy of the manual represents only the first few steps. DOS has remained consistent in some ways over the last (nearly) 40 years, but a lot has changed under the hood and programs were sometimes only written to work on very specific hardware and a very specific setup. They were released, sold some amount of copies, and then disappeared off the shelves, if not everyone\u2019s memories. It is all these extra steps, under the hood, of acquisition and configuration, that represents the hardest work by the eXoDOS project, and I recognise that long-time and Herculean effort. As a result, the eXoDOS project has over 7,000 titles they\u2019ve made work dependably and consistently.\u201d\n\nNow, if you\u2019d rather just get to the games, know that scanning your way through 2,500 titles is going to take some time. And you\u2019ll probably have to do a bit of internet searching to convince yourself to try titles that might sound familiar, but you don\u2019t really remember all that well. To get you started, here are a few recommendations we think are worth trying out (unless you want to go download and play everything).\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get much more fun than this. Sure, you can probably pick up this game on your favourite digital distribution service for a tiny fee, or you can just go ahead and sink hours into the MS-DOS version for absolutely nothing. Say hi to Stan for me.\n\nThis is one of the earliest games I remember playing on my MS-DOS system way back when\u2014likely a 386 or 486 computer with some paltry amount of memory (that at the time, probably felt pretty awesome). The joy of this game is in the brutality. You run around New York City, gunning down any bad guys you can get your hands on. The more evil you stop, the more money you make, and the closer you are to obliterating the mighty Kingpin. It didn\u2019t get much more violent than this back in the MS-DOS days.\n\nI mean, how else are you going to prepare for winning big on the show, like that guy from the documentary?\n\nI used to be terrified of this game as a kid for whatever reason. Now, it doesn\u2019t seem quite so bad. Your goal? Set traps to help keep mysterious intruders\u2014vampires, if I\u2019m right\u2014from killing a party\u2019s worth of people. It\u2019s a silly concept in 2019, but Night Trap was a pretty big deal two-plus decades ago.\n\nGet in some practice flying the way things used to be\u2014back in 1993\u2014before you take on Microsoft\u2019s big updated version that\u2019s set to launch next year.\n\nI still can\u2019t do a good carrier landing.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I convinced my parents to buy me this back in the \u201890s because I said it was educational. It is, sort of, since you\u2019re solving puzzles in all sorts of creative ways, but it\u2019s also a great way to spend an afternoon gaming.\n\nYes. Oh, yes. I was terrible at navigating my way through this game\u2019s dungeons, but I\u2019ll be damned if I didn\u2019t have the most maxed-out character in the realm\u2014thanks to the ingenious cheat of walking into one of the game\u2019s many shops, advancing time past the shop\u2019s closing, stealing everything on its shelves, then selling it all back to the shopkeeper (or keeping it yourself) in the morning. Ah, Daggerfall; you taught me how to cheat with creativity, which I carried with me right into my Dungeons & Dragons years.\n\nI never made it through this game, but I respect what it was trying to do way back in the early \u201890s. If you like adventures mixed with a bit of action\u2014which is basically Star Trek in a nutshell\u2014you\u2019ll get a kick out of this title, which I maintain was ahead of its time.", "description": "I\u2019ve previously talked about how the Internet Archive is a great place to play your favourite abandonware from decades ago within your browser, and it\u2019s even better now.
