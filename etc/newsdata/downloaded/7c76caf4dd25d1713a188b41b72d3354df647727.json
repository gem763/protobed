It might save a lot of lives.\n\n\"Current guidelines on the treatment of hypertension do not recommend any preferred treatment time. Morning ingestion has been the most common recommendation by physicians based on the misleading goal of reducing morning blood pressure levels.\n\n\"The results of this study show that patients who routinely take their anti-hypertensive medication at bedtime, as opposed to when they wake up, have better-controlled blood pressure and, most importantly, a significantly decreased risk of death or illness from heart and blood vessel problems.\"\n\nHe said more studies in different populations were needed to check that the findings will apply to all patients on different brands of blood pressure tablets.\n\nVanessa Smith, from the British Heart Foundation, said: \"Although this study supports previous findings in this area, further research amongst other ethnic groups and people who work shift patterns would be needed, to truly prove if taking blood pressure medication at night is more beneficial for cardiovascular health.\n\n\"If you're currently taking blood pressure medication, it's important to check with your GP or pharmacist before changing the time you take it. There may be specific reasons why your doctor has prescribed medication in the morning or night.\"\n\nLifestyle factors also make a difference to blood pressure, so avoid:", "description": "Evening doses gives more protection against heart attacks and strokes, a study suggests.", "authors": ["Michelle Roberts", "Health Editor", "Bbc News Online"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/28BF/production/_109313401_gettyimages-638777510.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
