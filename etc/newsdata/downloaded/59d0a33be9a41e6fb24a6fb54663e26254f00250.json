One EU diplomat said the meetings next week will take place on Tuesday, to update negotiators on the latest events during August, and on Thursday, to talk about preparations for no-deal exit.\n\nThe two sides have agreed to discuss a number of issues at future meetings including the backstop mechanism to keep the Northern Irish border open in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nA European Commission spokesman said: \u201cDavid Frost has asked to meet the Commission twice a week to discuss the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal. We have always said that our doors remain open and we have demonstrated our willingness to work 24/7 throughout this long process.\n\n\u201cWe expect the U.K. to come forward with concrete proposals as President Juncker made clear to Prime Minister Johnson earlier this week.\u201d\n\nJohnson has vowed to leave the EU without a deal if necessary, and has been accused of trying to bypass his opponents in the House of Commons by suspending parliament for almost a month.\n\nLast week the British prime minister travelled to Berlin for talks with Angela Merkel and to Paris to see Emmanuel Macron. Both suggested he produce proposals within 30 days that could serve as an alternative to the backstop, although Macron insisted a different deal would not be struck in that time.", "description": "Boris Johnson said the boost in activity was part of his approach to scrapping the Northern Irish backstop.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Charlie Cooper"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1164184542-1200x628.jpg"}
