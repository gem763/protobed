Elizabeth Warren. \u201cThat kind of worries me because it doesn\u2019t feel that early to me. I\u2019m like, \u2018Really?\u2019 It\u2019s disconcerting that there\u2019s not a clear candidate at this time.\u201d\n\nMs. Johansson said the Democrat resonates with her because she is \u201cthoughtful and progressive but realistic,\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like her campaign is making these crazy, outlandish promises that seem impossible to reach,\u201d the actress said. \u201cThere\u2019s a strategy there. I\u2019ll be there however I\u2019m needed. If I can help with voter engagement, whether it\u2019s doing some sort of PSA campaign or actively trying to involve people in the process of registering and voting. I really believe if people actually did vote, our government would look the way it\u2019s supposed to, but people just don\u2019t vote. It baffles me.\u201d\n\nRegarding her support for Mr. Allen and allegations of sexual abuse against him, the 2018 Women\u2019s March attendee said, \u201cI love Woody. I believe him, and I would work with him anytime. I see Woody whenever I can, and I have had a lot of conversations with him about it. I have been very direct with him, and he\u2019s very direct with me. He maintains his innocence, and I believe him.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
