News reported.\n\nWhen it was discovered that she was genetically predisposed to breast cancer as well as ovarian cancer she had a penetrative double mastectomy in 2013, two years later this was followed by the removal of her tubes and her ovaries.\n\n\"I'm often asked how my medical choices, and being public about them, have affected me. I simply feel I made choices to improve my odds of being here to see my children grow into adults, and of meeting my grandchildren,\" she added.\n\nThe Maleficent actress revealed that she wanted to give as many years to her children\u2019s lives which was something her mother couldn\u2019t do at the time.\n\n\"I have lived over a decade now without a mom. She met only a few of her grandchildren and was often too sick to play with them.\n\n\"My mother fought the disease for a decade and made it into her 50s. My grandmother died in her 40s. I'm hoping my choices allow me to live a bit longer.\"\n\nThe 44-year-old also revealed she had routine check-ups.\n\n\"I have a patch for hormones, and I need to get regular health checkups. I see and feel changes in my body, but I don't mind,\" she penned.\n\n\"People also ask how I feel about the physical scars I carry. I think our scars remind us of what we have overcome . . . the hardest scars to bear are often invisible, the scars in the mind.\"\n\nAngelina stressed the importance of a need for a holistic approach globally, particularly for women\u2019s healthcare.\n\n\"It should not take someone getting sick to realize that caring for them and not harming them is necessary.\"\n\nSources: PEOPLE, TIME, E!
