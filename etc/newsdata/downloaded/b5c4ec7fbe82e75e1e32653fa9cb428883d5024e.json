This is not the Vietnam War.\u201d\n\nYes, on Tuesday evening the Trump White House issued a public statement saying it would not only be declining to participate in the House of Representatives\u2019 ongoing impeachment probe but that it would be blocking any administration officials\u2019 attempts to.\n\nAs Noah explained, \u201cThis new tactic threw everything for a loop, because today was meant to be the big day when Congress would hear testimony from Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the EU and Jeff Ross stunt double. But just before the cameras started rolling, the White House pulled the plug,\u201d blocking Sondland\u2019s testimony.\n\n\u201cWow. Donald Trump\u2019s White House blocked an ambassador from testifying to Congress,\u201d said a shocked Noah. \u201cWhat a completely innocent thing to do! Yeah, I bet Trump was probably just scared that the ambassador would exonerate him too much.\u201d\n\nAccording to media reports, Sondland was Trump\u2019s boy Friday when it came to Ukraine, and, even before Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and withheld military aid, had been working behind the scenes and pressing Ukraine to probe the Bidens.\n\n\u201cOK, that\u2019s your first red flag right there. Trump\u2019s ambassador to the EU was getting involved with a country that isn\u2019t in the EU? That\u2019s not his jurisdiction!\u201d Noah exclaimed. \u201cAnd the reason Congress is so intent on having Sondland testify is\u2026 because he has text messages showing what was going on behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nYes, on Sept. 9, Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, texted Sondland, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance to help with a political campaign.\u201d In response, Sondland texted back, \u201cI believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions\u2026 The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind\u2026 I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d Sondland also later took the Taylor correspondence off-text, demanding that he call him.\n\n\u201cOK, I don\u2019t know if these guys are guilty or not, but you have to admit, those texts look hella suspicious,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBecause the only time you say, \u2018Stop texting, let\u2019s talk on the phone\u2019 is when something shady is going down. It\u2019s 2019\u2014no one talks on the phone. The only reason to talk on the phone at all is to wish your grandmother a happy birthday or to commit crimes.\u201d", "description": "The \u201cDaily Show\u201d host couldn\u2019t believe that the Trump White House has decided not to participate in Congress\u2019 impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_711,w_1265,x_0,y_7/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570597109/Screen_Shot_2019-10-09_at_12.43.09_AM_arj4x1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
