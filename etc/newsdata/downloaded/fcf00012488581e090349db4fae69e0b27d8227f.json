USA TODAY\n\nThe NBA may be 'woke' in America. But in China, NBA officials don't want to risk their bank accounts to support Uighurs or protesters in Hong Kong.\n\n\"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThis is hardly a controversial statement, especially not on the caustic and often profane platform of Twitter.\n\nBut these seven words ignited a firestorm of indignation, potentially destroyed millions in revenue, and revealed the shameful hypocrisy of both the National Basketball Association and corporate America in general.\n\nAfter Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted that phrase (since deleted), China lashed out at him, his team and the NBA as a whole. The Chinese Basketball Association immediately ended \u201cexchanges and cooperation\u201d with the Rockets, the state broadcaster dropped their preseason games from the TV schedule, and Chinese corporations ended their many sponsorships.\n\nWoke in America. Asleep elsewhere.\n\nAuthoritarians are gonna authoritarian; no news there. But the groveling of both the Rockets and the NBA to the Chinese communists shocked fans on the left and right.\n\n\"We apologize,\u201d Houston star James Harden said after a practice with teammate Russell Westbrook at his side. \"For both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love. So we appreciate them as a fan base. We love everything there about them, and we appreciate the support that they give us individually and as an organization.\"\n\nBusinesses need to show some spine: China's business bullying jumps to new heights over tweet by NBA Rockets GM\n\nThe NBA prostrated themselves further, apologizing that the tweet \"deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d This is the same organization that has eagerly leaned into progressive politics for years.\n\n1/ I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\nThe league might be woke in America but is fast asleep everywhere else.\n\nThree years ago, North Carolina mandated that in government buildings, people must use bathrooms specific to their legal gender. The NBA was enraged, pulling the 2017 All Star Game from Charlotte, punishing the state over the scandal.\n\nThis shocking bathroom bill affecting dozens of North Carolinians had to be opposed. But when China incarcerated an estimated 1 million Uighurs in concentration camps? Look, they might not even provide bathrooms, so where\u2019s the problem?\n\nPoor Uighurs can\u2019t afford Harden jerseys anyway.\n\nIt's all about the Benjamins, baby\n\nArizonans remember a similar treatment when Gov. Jan Brewer signed SB 1070 to limit illegal immigration. The home team quickly distanced itself with Suns owner Robert Sarver calling the bill \u201cmean-spirited\u201d and then-General Manager Steve Kerr comparing the state to \u201cNazi Germany.\u201d\n\nInstead of empathizing with the many Suns fans who agreed with the governor, NBA commissioner David Stern said, \"we think it's appropriate what the Suns are doing,\"\n\nChina, despite having, let\u2019s say, a more energetic opposition to immigration, gets a mewling apology from current commissioner Adam Silver.\n\nA mural made up of basketball player cards at the NBA exhibition in Beijing, China, in August 2019. (Photo: HOW HWEE YOUNG, EPA-EFE)\n\nKerr, now the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, has long been quick to condemn his political opponents. His team has refused to visit the White House, as is customary for NBA champions and felt \u201cdisgusted and disappointed\u201d by Trump\u2019s election.\n\nSurely, he must oppose the far worse Chinese government in this current imbroglio. \u201cIt's something I'm reading about just like everybody is,\u201d Kerr said, \u201cbut I'm not going to comment further than that.\"\n\nColleges have abandoned their mission: States are cutting university budgets. Taxpayers aren't interested in funding campus kooks\n\nProtesters in Hong Kong are risking their lives for freedom, but figures throughout the NBA won\u2019t risk a fraction of their bank accounts to support them. Bashing Trump won\u2019t prevent them from buying a new Bentley, but criticizing China might force a downgrade to a Mercedes Benz.\n\nThe only good to come from the league\u2019s Communist kowtow is a rare unity among the American left and right. Presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke tweeted, \u201cThe only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights. What an embarrassment.\u201d\n\nHis former Senate opponent Ted Cruz agreed. \u201cIn pursuit of big $$, the NBA is shamefully retreating.\u201d\n\nJon Gabriel, a Mesa resident, is editor-in-chief of Ricochet.com and a contributor to The Republic and azcentral.com, where this column originally appeared.
