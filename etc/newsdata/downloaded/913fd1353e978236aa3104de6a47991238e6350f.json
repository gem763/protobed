Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Dodgers, who have made it to the World Series the past two seasons but lost both times, had a low-key celebration on the field after the final out on Tuesday.\n\nSeager hit a three-run homer in the first and belted a two-run shot in the third as the Dodgers took a big lead early on and never looked back. Both long balls came off Baltimore starter Ty Blach (1-3).\n\nWalker Buehler (13-3) fired seven shutout innings for Los Angeles, striking out 11 while yielding four hits and no walks.\n\nBrewers 4, Marlins 3\n\nPinch hitter Tyler Austin lofted a tiebreaking sacrifice fly in the top of the ninth inning, and Milwaukee beat host Miami despite losing right fielder Christian Yelich to a season-ending knee injury.\n\nYelich \u2014 a strong candidate to win his second straight National League MVP award \u2014 left the game in the top of the first inning after he fouled a ball off his right knee. The Brewers announced postgame that he fractured his kneecap.\n\nMilwaukee\u2019s ninth-inning rally started with a leadoff single from former Miami Hurricanes catcher Yasmani Grandal. Trent Grisham, who had replaced Yelich, then doubled, and Grandal scored when Miami center fielder Lewis Brinson\u2019s throw home was offline on Austin\u2019s fly.\n\nMets 3, Diamondbacks 2\n\nZack Wheeler tossed seven strong innings, and Todd Frazier accounted for all the Mets\u2019 runs with a pair of RBI doubles as New York beat visiting Arizona.\n\nWheeler (11-7) allowed one run on seven hits and two walks while striking out seven. He limited the Diamondbacks to two hits in 12 at-bats with runners on base.\n\nBrad Brach recorded two outs in the eighth but gave up a homer to Eduardo Escobar before Justin Wilson got the final four outs for his second save. Wilson struck out ex-Mets infielder Wilmer Flores with two on for the final out.\n\nPhillies 6, Braves 5\n\nCorey Dickerson homered twice and knocked in three runs to lift host Philadelphia past Atlanta.\n\nJ.T. Realmuto and Bryce Harper each added a home run, and Scott Kingery contributed an inside-the-park homer. Blake Parker (3-2) earned the win in relief, while Hector Neris earned his 25th save with a scoreless ninth inning.\n\nRonald Acuna Jr. and Freddie Freeman each had three hits for the Braves, and Johan Camargo homered.\n\nTwins 5, Nationals 0\n\nMitch Garver hit a two-run homer and Jose Berrios pitched seven strong innings to lead Minnesota to a victory over Washington in Minneapolis.\n\nGarver became the third Twins player to reach the 30-homer mark this season, joining Max Kepler (36) and Nelson Cruz (35). It\u2019s the first time since 1987 that Minnesota has had three players hit 30 home runs in a season and the fifth time in franchise history.\n\nBerrios (12-8), who entered the contest with a 1-3 record and 8.07 ERA in his six previous starts, allowed just two hits and a walk while striking out four.\n\nRays 5, Rangers 3 (11 innings)\n\nTampa Bay scored a pair of unearned runs with the help of two Texas throwing errors in the 11th inning to post a win in Arlington, Texas.\n\nEmilio Pagan (4-2) pitched a scoreless 10th for the victory, and Pete Fairbanks worked around two hits in the bottom of the 11th to notch his first career save.\n\nAustin Meadows slugged a two-run homer for the Rays, who won their sixth straight. Nick Solak went 2-for-5 with a two-run homer for the Rangers.\n\nTigers 12, Yankees 11\n\nJordy Mercer hit a game-winning RBI single in the ninth as host Detroit overcame a six-homer onslaught by New York.\n\nJeimer Candelario drove in three runs for Detroit while Christin Stewart homered and knocked in two runs. Joe Jimenez (4-7) pitched a scoreless inning to get the win for the Tigers, who wiped out an early six-run deficit.\n\nBrett Gardner and Didi Gregorius hit two homers apiece for New York. Edwin Encarnacion and Gleyber Torres also went deep.\n\nAthletics 21, Astros 7\n\nMatt Olson and Sean Murphy recorded multi-homer games, and Oakland made amends for a 15-0 loss in the opener of a four-game series by dismantling host Houston.\n\nOlson set a single-season high with his 30th home run and then added his 31st as well, while Murphy ran his career and season totals to three. The Athletics slugged six homers, including three two-run blasts off Joe Biagini in the fourth inning.\n\nThe Athletics were already comfortably ahead 11-2 before they teed off against Biagini. They tagged Wade Miley (13-5) for seven runs in the top of the first, stringing together six consecutive one-out singles after Marcus Semien opened the game with a single and Olson walked two batters later.\n\nBlue Jays 4, Red Sox 3\n\nKen Giles retired Rafael Devers with two on in the ninth inning to seal host Toronto\u2019s victory over Boston to snap a season-high, seven-game losing streak.\n\nGiles converted his 19th save in 20 chances, but it was hardly easy. He needed to 29 pitches to cap a night in which six Toronto relievers combined for 4 2/3 scoreless innings.\n\nThe Blue Jays scored all of their runs on homers by Cavan Biggio, Reese McGuire and Rowdy Tellez. The Red Sox lost their fourth straight and fell to 3-7 in their past 10 games.\n\nRockies 2, Cardinals 1\n\nNolan Arenado homered for one of his two hits, Chi Chi Gonzalez pitched six solid innings for his first win of the season, and Colorado beat St. Louis in Denver.\n\nGonzalez (1-6) gave up just one run on four hits, struck out four and didn\u2019t walk a batter. Jairo Diaz pitched two innings to pick up his second save, and Charlie Blackmon added two hits for the Rockies.\n\nDexter Fowler doubled and scored for the Cardinals, who managed just six hits.\n\nWhite Sox 7, Royals 3\n\nYoan Moncada had three hits, including one of Chicago\u2019s three home runs, as the host White Sox defeated visiting Kansas City.\n\nThe Royals got home runs from Adalberto Mondesi, Alex Gordon and Ryan O\u2019Hearn, but they were all solo shots, while Chicago got a grand slam from Eloy Jimenez and a two-run shot from Moncada.\n\nIvan Nova (10-12) won despite serving up all three of the Royals\u2019 homers and allowing six hits in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out five without a walk.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Corey Seager homered twice in the first three innings and finished with five RBIs as the visiting Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Baltimore Orioles 7-3 on Tuesday night to clinch their seventh consecutive National League West title.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428587655&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0B5-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
