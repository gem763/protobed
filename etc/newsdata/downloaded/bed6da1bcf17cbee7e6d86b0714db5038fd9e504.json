Like everybody, you like to dominate on all phases of the game, but it doesn\u2019t always work out like that. It\u2019s nice to be able to learn with a win.\u201d\n\nBoise State (2-0) is learning that its freshman quarterback, Hank Bachmeier, is more than competent to continue the program\u2019s burgeoning lineage of star quarterbacks. And, it might just have a freshman star running back, too.\n\nBachmeier, who threw for over 400 yards in the season opener, was 22-of-34 passing for 282 yards with a touchdown and an interception. He also scored on a 1-yard run just before the end of the first half, diving and extending the ball across the goal line as he absorbed a hit.\n\n\u201cHank has shown his toughness and competitiveness in these two games,\u201d Harsin said. \u201cThere\u2019s been no back down. He wants to go out there and succeed.\u201d\n\nIn the second half, with starter Robert Mahone out with a stinger in his right shoulder, George Holani rushed for 103 yards on 22 carries. He was the first running back to eclipse the 100-yard mark against Marshall since Southern Miss\u2019s Ito Smith had 150 on Nov. 25, 2017.\n\nBut it was the Boise State defense that stole the spotlight, holding its opponent scoreless in the second half.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a relentless defense, to go out there and do what they did in the second half,\u201d Harsin said. \u201cIf we win games with our defense like that, I\u2019m all about it.\u201d\n\nMarshall didn\u2019t convert a first down in the second half and ran only 16 plays that accounted for just 6:52 of possession.\n\n\u201cOur defense played well, but our offense needs to make more plays,\u201d Marshall coach Doc Holliday said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the way we played, but not proud that we didn\u2019t win the game.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMarshall: While the Thundering Herd had their streak of 15 games without a 100-yard rusher snapped, the secondary needs the most immediate attention. Marshall allowed five pass plays of 20 yards or more, igniting Boise State\u2019s first two scoring drives.\n\nBoise State: After last week\u2019s opener, one area of emphasis for the offensive line was getting better protection for its quarterback. The Broncos still have work to do there as Bachmeier was under duress all night long and was strip-sacked once, resulting in a takeaway for Marshall.\n\nBAD WOLF?\n\nEarly in the second quarter, with Boise State\u2019s offense struggling, Harsin went after one of the line judges about an earlier missed penalty and bumped him, drawing a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\n\u201cMaybe I let the bad wolf out a little bit in that moment,\u201d Harsin said after the game. \u201cIt hurt our team. I told them that we haven\u2019t had a personal foul this season, and when they see what I have to do, they\u2019re not going to want to get one. We can\u2019t have it happen. I owned it and we\u2019ll handle it.\u201d\n\nHarsin wouldn\u2019t say what his punishment would be, but by the way he talked, it\u2019s likely to be tougher than the 20-minute run Nick Saban\u2019s wife made him spend on the treadmill for the unsportsmanlike penalty he drew against Duke in Alabama\u2019s opener.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMarshall: Hosts Ohio on Sept. 14.\n\nBoise State: Hosts Portland State on Sept. 14.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With a pair of true freshmen guiding Boise State's sputtering offense, the Broncos leaned on their defense to deliver a win against Marshall.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jason Chatraw"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/marshall_boise_st_football_82588_c0-115-2755-1721_s1770x1032.jpg?2b05b0ee52e402f76e577265ec6d74d2c39ff405", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
