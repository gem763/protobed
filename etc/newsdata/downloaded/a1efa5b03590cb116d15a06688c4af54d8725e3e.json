Desktop-class web browser that won\u2019t kick you to an app or serve up a mobile version of a website? Check. Secure OS updated with new security, bug fixes, and features on a six-week cycle? Check.\n\nMassive library of apps to cover your needs when web apps won\u2019t do? An interface that can switch between a touch-optimized tablet mode and a desktop mode when a keyboard and mouse are attached? USB ports that aren\u2019t arbitrarily locked down so you can\u2019t do basic file management? Check, check, and double check. (There are two USB-C ports on the Pixel Slate.)\n\nBut even though the Pixel Slate checks boxes that the iPad Pro does not, it\u2019s not better. In every place where the iPad is restricted but elegant, the Pixel Slate is open but slapdash.\n\nWhile the hardware is nice, using the Pixel Slate requires you to endure a hundred tiny software indignities. For a device that starts at $599 and can run as much as two grand for the fully specced model with keyboard and pen, that\u2019s at least a few dozen indignities too many.\n\nThe Pixel Slate is Google\u2019s first tablet in some years, running Chrome OS instead of Android. It\u2019s not the very first Chrome OS tablet, but it\u2019s the first one from Google. The good news is that the hardware is excellent. It\u2019s not as gobsmackingly advanced as the iPad Pro, but it\u2019s solid.\n\nIt has a 12.3-inch, 3000 x 2000 pixel touchscreen surrounded by bezels that aren\u2019t overwhelmingly large. Google calls this screen a \u201cmolecular display\u201d because it uses a different kind of substrate for the LCD that is lower power (and because nobody seems to be able to resist giving new screen tech a wacky name anymore). Anyway, it\u2019s good. It can get super bright and has only a little drop-off when viewed at an angle.\n\nThe bezels could stand to be a little smaller, but one of the reasons they\u2019re there is to house two front-facing speakers that flank the display on the left and right. Google seems fairly dedicated to speakers that point directly at you \u2014 its phones have them as well \u2014 and they make perfect sense on a tablet. They can get really loud, do so without distortion, and even manage to deliver a little bit of bass.\n\nThe aluminum body comes in one color, slate blue (get it?), and it picks up fingerprints and smudges really easily, but the build quality is solid and refined. The edges are rounded, and the front glass curves down to meet the edge. It looks like a Pixel phone blown up into a tablet size. There\u2019s even a fingerprint sensor smartly integrated into the power button for logging in.\n\nThe Slate is big by tablet standards but small by laptop standards. It is very close in size to the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and it does the same trick of feeling a little smaller than it is. On its own, it weighs 1.6 pounds, but you\u2019ll want to add a keyboard to it, which will add weight. With Google\u2019s Pixel Slate keyboard, the whole package actually weighs a little more than a Pixelbook.\n\nSpeaking of the Pixel Slate keyboard, it is a good microcosm of the whole device: it\u2019s a really good idea that\u2019s executed badly. It\u2019s a \u201cfolio\u201d-style keyboard, which means it has a flap that covers the back of the device. You can slide that flap down on a system of magnets to hold up the Pixel Slate at any angle, and you can also flip the keyboard underneath it for an easel mode. The keys on it are circular, which is weird at first but totally works. I also like that they\u2019re backlit, have good key travel, and are fairly quiet.\n\nThe keyboard attaches via a magnetic connector, and the Slate is pretty smart about switching between tablet mode and laptop mode, depending on whether it\u2019s connected or if the keyboard is flipped around. This is all very good, but Google whiffed the details on the keyboard deck. It\u2019s so flimsy that if you have it balanced on anything but a perfectly stable, flat surface, it can flex so much that the trackpad actually clicks. And it\u2019s attached only by that single flap, so the whole thing can wobble around if, again, it\u2019s not on a perfectly flat, stable surface.\n\nLuckily, there\u2019s a Brydge Bluetooth keyboard that\u2019s custom-designed for the Slate that makes it work much more like a laptop and costs $40 less to boot. Although, as I\u2019ll get to, Bluetooth has not been reliable for me on this device.\n\nGoogle gets top marks for the exterior of the Pixel Slate (keyboard excepted), but the interior is where things start to get messy. Google has decided that the best move is to offer this thing in five different models, which includes four different Intel processor choices, four different storage tiers, and three different RAM options.\n\nPrices range from $599 for a base model with a dinky Intel Celeron processor and anemic storage and RAM all the way up to $1,599 for something that\u2019s overkill for nearly everybody. The Pixel Slate keyboard is an additional $199 (there\u2019s also that $159.99 Brydge option I mentioned earlier), and the Pixelbook Pen is $99. Even though I usually want LTE, I\u2019m almost glad that isn\u2019t an option here because there are already way too many choices.\n\nUnderstanding which model to get requires you to know quite a lot about what Chrome OS is and how Chrome OS behaves with different specs. The cheapest model will likely frustrate you if you push it beyond a dozen tabs or a couple of Android apps.\n\nI\u2019ve been testing the $999 machine with a Core i5 Y-Series Intel processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, along with the keyboard and pen for a total of $1,297. I think it\u2019s the only model that makes sense for this computer, but I think that because I know how Chrome OS works, and I know that I want to do more than just use it as a tablet for light web browsing and Netflix binge-watching.\n\nSince you need to know a lot about Chrome OS to get the most out of the Pixel Slate (no matter which one you buy), let\u2019s talk about Chrome OS and how it works on the Pixel Slate.\n\nWhen you have a keyboard attached, the Pixel Slate works like any other Chromebook. There\u2019s a mouse and resizable windows. You can open up Chrome tabs, web apps, and Android apps, and move them around. It\u2019s all really familiar if you\u2019ve used a modern Chromebook \u2014 down to Android apps working but feeling like an invasive species.\n\nHere\u2019s where we get into those tiny indignities I mentioned earlier. We\u2019re a year and a half into the experiment of letting Google Play Store Android apps run on Chrome OS, and that experiment is not going well.\n\nProgress in getting Android apps to work better on big screens has been painfully slow. Spotify only recently began allowing the ability to resize its app window, but it\u2019s still just a silly blown-up phone app. The same goes with Google\u2019s own apps. YouTube Music is a mess on this size screen. And you as a user have to make decisions about which version of apps like YouTube Music to use in the first place: the web app or the Android app?\n\nI can accept some of these foibles because I have managed to only use Android apps in a few places where I really need them. And, honestly, they are sometimes more useful than web apps. What I have a harder time accepting is that there are just too many bugs. My first review unit spiraled into a bootloop that Google could not diagnose and had to replace. The second has been more stable, except that sometimes Bluetooth disconnects or even straight up refuses to turn on until after a reboot.\n\nHere, I\u2019ll remind you that Google excised the headphone jack from this device so you\u2019ll be dependent on Bluetooth a lot more. I have contacted Google about the Bluetooth bug (among other things), and here\u2019s its statement: \u201cWe\u2019ve received reports about intermittent Bluetooth issues and are working on a fix as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nOther bugs are just sort of infuriating. When the keyboard is attached, moving windows around feels relatively fast and smooth, even with a few Android apps and well over 20 tabs or web apps open. But switch the Pixel Slate into tablet mode and start using the swipe gestures, and it turns into a stuttery, laggy mess. Input with the Pixelbook Pen is similarly unpredictable: sometimes it\u2019s fine; other times, it lags so badly in Google Keep that I have to quit the app and try again.\n\nChrome OS is an operating system designed for laptops that has enrolled in an adult education class for tablets and hasn\u2019t even understood its assignments, much less done the homework.\n\nWhat\u2019s frustrating is that you can see the really great, flexible, and useful system underneath all of this sloppiness. There are genuinely nice touches: the Google Assistant app is fast and a nice complement to the main search function, though I still wish they were more fully integrated. You can change the full-sized keyboard to a little phone-sized floating keyboard that works really well to swipe type on, or you can use the pen for handwriting input.\n\nAnother example of how the foundation is there are the two USB-C ports. They just do what you expect USB ports to do. It\u2019s great that there are two of them. I had our New York office ship over a big dumb box of USB accessories to plug into it. Basically, I repeated the experiment Nilay ran with the iPad Pro, and nearly everything just worked.\n\nThe operating system doesn\u2019t limit the USB ports, but many apps don\u2019t work with it as well as they could\n\nExternal hard drives, USB mics, SD cards, and even a printer worked fine with the Pixel Slate (though the printer needed an HP Chrome extension). Unlike iOS where the limitations come from the operating system, here, the limitations come from \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 the weird way Android apps have been glommed onto Chrome OS.\n\nLet\u2019s use Adobe Lightroom CC as an example. When you plug in an SD card, the Files app pops up, and you have access to the files. So far, so good. But open up the Android version of Lightroom, and it can\u2019t see the external drive (probably because it was designed for Android phones and tablets). So you have to pull the photos into Chrome OS local storage via the Files app, import them into Lightroom, and then delete them.\n\nIt\u2019s the same rigamarole you have to go through with the iPad Pro, only with the Files app instead of the Photos app. But there\u2019s a crucial difference: the only reason that\u2019s the case is because Adobe hasn\u2019t updated Lightroom to work better with Chrome OS\u2019s file picker.\n\nI\u2019m not picking on Adobe here, nor do I mean to imply that this Lightroom USB test is the end-all test for defining what counts as a \u201cpro computer.\u201d Instead, I\u2019m pointing out that the limitations you run into when you use Android apps on Chrome OS are due to an ecosystem that isn\u2019t as fully developed as it needs to be.\n\nYou can work around all of these software indignities. You can find little hacks and Chrome extensions, you can deeply understand the differences between Android and web apps, you can harangue app developers to update their software, and you can reboot the whole thing when your Bluetooth starts acting squirrely.\n\nYou can work around the issues, but why should you have to?\n\nFor some people, those workarounds will be totally worth it because the trade-off is a more open computing platform that gives you a better web browser, a mouse, windows, and even Linux if you want it. These people are Chrome OS diehards, and they\u2019re really the only people I think should even consider the Pixel Slate.\n\nBut even for them, the Slate just doesn\u2019t feel ready yet. Last year\u2019s Pixelbook is still around and getting discounted all the time. Sure, it has last year\u2019s processor and you can\u2019t detach the keyboard, but I\u2019ve found it to be stabler and simpler. It also weighs a quarter pound less than the Slate with the keyboard attached. I still love my Pixelbook, and I\u2019m sticking with it.\n\nThe Pixel Slate has a lot going for it, but it\u2019s just too experimental. The bummer is that I actually like what Google is trying to do here. I just wish it was less trying and more doing.", "description": "Google\u2019s first tablet running Chrome OS has ambitions to take on Apple\u2019s iPad Pro, but it can\u2019t get there.
