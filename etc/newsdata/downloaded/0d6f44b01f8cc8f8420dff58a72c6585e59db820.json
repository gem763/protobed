Yankees slugger Aaron Judge towered in front of him at the plate. Pitching coach Wes Johnson jogged to the mound to deliver a simple message.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Have some fun,\u2019\u201d Thorpe said, \u201cand I smiled and threw a first-pitch slider.\u201d\n\nJudge swung and grounded into a double play. The Twins went on to beat the Yankees, who they\u2019ll face on Friday in Game 1 of their AL Division Series.\n\nAdvising professional athletes is never quite so finger-snap easy, of course. To directly correlate every point of progress by a Twins pitcher this season to the work that Johnson has done in his first year would be disingenuous, ignorant of the dozens of others in the organization who play a part in player development.\n\nThis unorthodox decision to hire Johnson from the University of Arkansas, believed to be the first pitching coach to ever jump from college straight to the major leagues, sure has paid off in spades, or, well, strikes.\n\n\u201cHe did his homework on all of us, especially this offseason. He came at us with a plan and a reason and stats to prove it and basically made it really easy to get behind,\u201d said right-hander Tyler Duffey, whose improvement this year has been as drastic as any pitcher on the staff. \u201cHe comes at you with a lot of positivity, which I think a lot of times is a good thing, especially if you\u2019re struggling a little bit. I like being told like it is, but every once in a while you need a little pump up.\u201d\n\nThe 48-year-old Johnson has brought just that to the AL Central champions, a walking cup of coffee who\u2019s clearly on a mission wherever he\u2019s spotted in the clubhouse during pregame preparations.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a tremendous amount of energy, and it\u2019s awesome to see someone else who can match me or challenges me to match them energy-wise,\u201d said right-hander Sergio Romo, the trade-deadline acquisition who will likely be one of only two pitchers on the postseason roster in their 30s. \u201cIt\u2019s just been consistent, and that\u2019s one of the things that I respect the most.\u201d\n\nThe schedule of games, the environment around the team, and the makeup of players in college is drastically different than in the pros, and a new authority figure with no prior experience in the majors would stand to meet some resistance from established players if the expectations, process or strategy are altered without reason or warning. That\u2019s the polar opposite, though, of how Johnson approaches his teaching.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s our job as a coach, and this is my philosophy, to find what a guy does really well and try to find a way to get him to do that more,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cas opposed to finding what he does bad and exploiting that and telling him he\u2019s got to get better. Whoever you want to look at, they\u2019ve all done things really well to get here at some point in their career. So we tend to focus more on that.\u201d\n\nStarting pitchers Jake Odorizzi and Kyle Gibson had a head start on the relationship, having done winter workouts with pitching specialist Randy Sullivan, who runs elite training camps in Florida he used to conduct in Texas with Johnson.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really adapted well to a pro-style clubhouse as opposed to a college level,\u201d Odorizzi said. \u201cI never attended college, but the coaches are the rulers in college, but here everybody\u2019s kind of on par together and we\u2019re a team as opposed to them dictating what you need to be doing.\u201d\n\nAs the Twins assembled their staff last winter under new manager Rocco Baldelli, chief baseball officer Derek Falvey was intrigued by Johnson, whose background in biomechanics was familiar to him from the offseason conference circuit. Johnson earned a master\u2019s degree in kinesiology while he was on staff at Dallas Baptist University. His college-specific experience made him an unconventional candidate, sure, but pitching is pitching and personality is the key.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re doing it the same as everyone else, by definition that\u2019s league average,\u201d Falvey said. \u201cIf we do things in a league-average way, we shouldn\u2019t expect to be better than league average as a team, so in my mind, we have to be open to new ideas.\u201d\n\nThe staff has shown some vulnerability, with a 4.44 post-All-Star-break ERA that\u2019s the second-worst of the eight remaining teams in the playoffs, ahead of only the Yankees, but whether it was Taylor Rogers cementing himself as the closer, Duffey becoming a bulwark of the sixth and seventh innings by going 25 straight games without allowing a run, or Odorizzi being selected as a first-time All-Star, the Twins have unquestionably fielded a stronger pitching staff this year under the guidance of Johnson and assistant pitching coach Jeremy Hefner.\n\nTheir 4.18 ERA for the season was ninth-best in the major leagues, the highest rank in the 10-year Target Field era. They were 22nd last season and 29th four times in a six-year span from 2011-16.\n\nThe process started soon after Johnson was hired, when he and Hefner toted video clips and PowerPoint slides and flew cross-country to meet their pupils. There weren\u2019t sweeping changes made to workout regimens or curveball grips, just data-based arguments for using different pitches at different times. The work that started last winter has not stopped.\n\n\u201cHe is here for his pitchers, and he is here for this team,\u201d Baldelli said, \u201cand he\u2019s completely invested in them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Minnesota Twins had a lead on the New York Yankees that had dwindled to one run on this late July night, and rookie Lewis Thorpe was in a daunting situation with one out in the sixth inning.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Campbell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/twins_tigers_baseball_99149_c0-146-3500-2186_s1770x1032.jpg?28e1112a076ec7fecf74d701fc168de288d8a301"}
