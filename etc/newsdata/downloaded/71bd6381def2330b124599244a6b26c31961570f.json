Its chief executive reckons it can broaden its appeal \u2013 but will have to get tough with some users\n\nSwipe right for \u201cwould like to meet\u201d, left for \u201cwouldn\u2019t\u201d. Seven years after Tinder made choosing a date as simple as flicking your thumb across a smartphone screen, it is by far the most-used dating app in the UK and the US. Downloaded 300m times and with more than 5 million paying subscribers, it is the highest-grossing app of any kind in the world, according to the analysts App Annie. For Americans, apps and online dating are the most common way to meet a partner. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing responsibility, and an amazing privilege,\u201d says Elie Seidman, Tinder\u2019s 45-year-old chief executive. If he finds it less daunting than others might, that\u2019s because, before he took over Tinder in 2018, he was in charge of OkCupid, the Tinder of the 00s. He has spent much of his working life helping people to find love.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of our employees are energised by that very mission,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not selling plumbing supplies, right? Obviously, plumbing is really important, but ours is a really noble and exciting mission. So, when we\u2019re taking new risks \u2013 new challenges, new chances \u2013 we know that, if we\u2019re successful, it\u2019s about helping members connect.\u201d\n\nAt times, though, it has felt as if Tinder has chased that goal with too much passion. Launching on college campuses, before expanding to New York, London and then everywhere, Tinder rapidly gained a reputation as less of a dating app and more of a \u201chook-up\u201d app: laser-focused at finding users a match as quickly as possible, with minimal fuss between opening the app and getting lucky.\n\nIn its early days, Tinder leaned into this reputation. Perhaps the most notorious feature was the introduction of a secret \u201cElo ranking\u201d, a term borrowed from the chess world to describe a way to score people based on their previous matches. With the Tinder version, your score went up a lot if hot people swiped right on you; if ugly people swiped left on you, it went down just as much. Whether or not your matches were hot was based on their own Elo ranking, and so on.\n\nMatching hot people to hot people felt like the purest distillation of what Tinder was \u2013 and a good summation of the often bro-filled atmosphere in the office in the early days. (This approach continues to shake out in messy legal battles between cofounders, with allegations of sexual harassment blending with claims of share-price manipulation.) In hindsight, Seidman says, this approach was a mistake. Now, rather than how hot a person might be perceived to be, it\u2019s how often they use the app that takes priority \u2013 that and location, which, Seidman points out, is hardly an innovation. \u201cMy father has a story from when he was growing up in Queens. He was dating a woman who lived on the Upper East Side. She broke up with him because he was \u2018geographically undesirable\u2019. So the idea of long commutes being a thing, we see that very clearly. The other one\u2019s age, right? People absolutely filter on age. They also filter on sexual orientation, not surprisingly.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The quality or relationships that are being made are as good or better.\u2019 Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nWhen it comes to the systemic \u2013 almost species-level \u2013 effects of Tinder, Seidman is happy. \u201cThe relationships are much more diverse,\u201d he says, citing a 2017 study from Cornell University which argued that the rise in online dating had resulted in an increase in mixed-race marriages in the US. \u201cFor human history, right, we meet people down the street \u2013 you know, a mile away, two miles away, church, work, school \u2013 and all of a sudden the breadth that you get has been totally changed. That\u2019s a profound shift and a good one.\u201d\n\nAnd, he adds: \u201cThe quality of the relationships and the connections that are being made by all accounts is as good or better, according to the University of Chicago.\u201d A 2013 study found that couples who meet online \u201chave happier, longer marriages\u201d.\n\nMore diverse, happier, longer relationships is certainly a something for the company to boast about. But for many users, these possibilities aren\u2019t worth the stress of using Tinder day-to-day.\n\nThe app, like most dating services, has many more male users than female users. According to the analytics firm App Ape, more than three-quarters are men \u2013 a disparity that is bad for everyone. Men complain about being ignored or mocked when they do get matched with a date. They are the main target of Tinder\u2019s revenue drives, with paid services such as Tinder Plus and Tinder Gold offering users the ability to promote themselves to the top of their likers\u2019 queues and highlight their profiles to others. (Tinder settled a class-action suit this year over age-discriminatory pricing for these features. It had been charging older users more for the same tools.)\n\nWe\u2019re better at it than we were two or three years ago. It is much harder to misbehave and stay on Tinder\n\nBut women have it worse. Even putting aside Margaret Atwood\u2019s observation that men worry that women will laugh at them, while women worry that men will kill them, the misogyny on Tinder is the stuff of legend. One 2016 study, from Manchester Metropolitan University, found that straight men who feel \u201clet down\u201d after finding a date was less attractive than her picture saw it as \u201ca licence to use their date as they saw fit\u201d. Meanwhile, dick pics, solicited and otherwise, are so ubiquitous that they are inspiring art. Francesca Harris, a student at the University of Nottingham, used the app to solicit more than 300 (and one headshot of Donald Trump) for her fine-art degree show project, entitled The Modern Male.\n\n\u201cWe have a really, really, really clear view,\u201d Seidman says, \u201cwhich is that people who are awful need to be removed from these apps. We have a ton of work in our trust and safety group between tech and people \u2013 massive teams of moderators benefiting from AI. We have things in the app to educate people about how to behave. So we\u2019re coming at it from a lot of angles. If you have behaved badly, we want you out \u2013 and we want you out as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nSeidman says Tinder\u2019s record has improved. \u201cWithout getting into lots of specific details about metrics, which I won\u2019t divulge, we\u2019re much, much, much better at it than we were two or three years ago. It is much harder to misbehave and stay on Tinder.\u201d\n\nBut if Tinder is getting better at spotting abusive behaviour, and turfing perpetrators off the platform, what about the other side: are people learning to behave better in the first place? \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that if you grow up in a world where you are accustomed to digital social \u2013 you were on Fortnite with your friends or your friends of friends, or you did FaceTime with your aunt or your grandmother when you were a kid \u2013 you don\u2019t think of the digital world as a different world, one where the rules of decorum and the norms of behaviour that we take for granted in a bar or a restaurant just go out the window. It\u2019s not an alternate universe. It\u2019s a part of real life. Every next set of 18- and 19- and 20-year-olds who join Tinder have grown up in a different environment in terms of digital social life.\u201d\n\nThat generational shift, Seidman says, is crucial to understanding Tinder\u2019s very visual skew, which differentiates it from older services such as OkCupid and has been blamed for the \u201cshallow\u201d nature of the connections it leads to. On OkCupid, when Seidman started, users were asked to fill in enormous questionnaires. An algorithm then purported to match them to those most compatible based on anything from big life choices to opinions on blockbuster movies. On Tinder, by contrast, the basic question is simpler: \u201cIs this person hot?\u201d\n\nWhy childhood sweethearts no longer measure up \u2013 and six other ways dating has changed Read more\n\nSeidman argues that this shift is, in part, just a reflection of the changing nature of technology. \u201cThe internet has become vastly more visual over the past 20 years, right?\u201d Smartphones played a big part in this because they made it so much easier to upload photos. In fact, if you can remember the net before smartphones, Tinder may well not be for you. Half of the app\u2019s users are under 25 (and, Seidman emphasises, over 18), and signing up for an account as you arrive at university is virtually a rite of passage for Gen Z. With that comes new ambitions.\n\nThe core of the Tinder interface, with its pictures and swiping, is, Seidman says, designed to replicate the \u201cclick\u201d that two people get when they lock eyes for the first time, only in a way that works for a generation that has already used to the idea of socialising online. So what next? The first date. \u201cTo what extent can we get the elements, the quality elements of a first date to happen digitally? The thing people are struggling with, is: \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got this match. How can I figure out if we\u2019re going to like each other. Do we have anything to talk about? Can we connect and, you know, how\u2019s our chemistry?\u2019 Right? And so can we get more of what you would get and figure out on our first date?\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s first exploration into answering those questions is \u2026 odd. Swipe Night, running every Sunday in October, is Tinder\u2019s first original video production. As in the Black Mirror episode Bandersnatch, viewers get to pick how the story progresses. Unlike Bandersnatch, they get matched with others on the platform who picked similar outcomes. \u201cWe\u2019re saying: \u2018Hey, not only is it connections that you make, but we think that the shared experience as a community \u2013 of coming together \u2013 is a really special one. We think that shared experiences as a community of people is a powerful, important and ancient idea \u2013 and it shouldn\u2019t go away.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs long as those shared experiences don\u2019t involve unwanted dick pics, he may have a point.", "description": "The dating app has become the go-to tool for singles looking for a \u2018hook-up\u2019 rather than a relationship.
