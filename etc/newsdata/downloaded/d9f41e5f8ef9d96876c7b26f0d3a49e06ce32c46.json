It comprises a ground floor bar with poker machines, a restaurant, 12 parking spaces, squash courts and a gymnasium.\n\nThe sale was brokered by Colliers International's Tom O\u2019Neill and Vince Kernahan in conjunction with Henderson and Horning\u2019s William Mulvihill and Bill Rees.", "description": "Sydney-based fund manager Fife Capital has bought a four-level strata property in Sydney's CBD.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6132%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fa0bfdc8c7d485a2a479389f0ee20207f4c29104", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
