Buyers will switch towards these suppliers,\" he said.\n\nOnions are used as the base for traditional dishes across Asia such as biryani in Pakistan and India, belacan in Malaysia and fish curry in Bangladesh.\n\nIn June, India withdrew 10% export incentives on onions after prices started to rise due to dwindling supplies from last year's harvest and a delay in planting of the summer-sown crop. prices could start moderating from November with the arrival of the new season crop, said a Mumbai-based exporter, who declined to be named.\n\n\"The government will remove restrictions once prices fall below 15,000 rupees per tonne,\" he said.\n\nIndia exported 2.2 million tonnes of fresh onions in the 2018/19 fiscal year ended March 30.\n\n($1 = 70.9370 Indian rupees)", "description": "India curbs onion shipments by imposing minimum export price", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_6_800x533_L_1412601562.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
