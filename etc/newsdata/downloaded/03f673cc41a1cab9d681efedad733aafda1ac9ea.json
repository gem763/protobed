REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo\n\nFrom October, the company will be producing 5,000 of the 5G mobile communications base stations per month, and next year it plans to make about 1.5 million stations, Ren said during a forum.\n\nHuawei, the world\u2019s largest telecoms gear maker, has been on a U.S. trade blacklist since May over concerns that its equipment could be used by Beijing to spy. Huawei has repeatedly denied such allegations, but has taken steps to minimize the impact.\n\nU.S. sanctions cut off Huawei\u2019s access to essential U.S. technologies. The latest version of its Mate 30 flagship phone, unveiled last week in Europe, will not come with Google Mobile Services.\n\n\u201cWe carried out the testing in August and September, and from October on we will start scale production, at 5,000 units a month,\u201d Ren said.\n\n\u201cSo our production capacity this year will be 600,000 and we expect that figure to go up to 1.5 million next year.\u201d\n\nWill Zhang, Huawei\u2019s president of corporate strategy, told Reuters the performance of the U.S.-free base stations was \u201cno worse\u201d, and the company \u201chas had positive surprises\u201d. He declined to give details.\n\nRen said Huawei would still like to use U.S. components if possible because it has \u201cemotional ties\u201d with long-time U.S. suppliers.\n\nEarlier this month, Ren said that he was open to selling the firm\u2019s 5G technology - including patents, code, blueprints and production know-how - to Western firms for a one-off fee.\n\nOn Thursday he went further, saying Huawei was willing to license its 5G mobile technology to a U.S. company, and that he was not afraid of creating a rival by making Huawei\u2019s technology available to competitors.\n\nThe offer could also include chip design know-how, he added.\n\nThe offer to license out 5G technology marks the latest attempt by Huawei, also the world\u2019s No.2 smartphone vendor, to minimize the impact of the U.S. trade ban. It expects a hit of some $10 billion to revenue from its phone business this year.", "description": "Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei said on Thursday the company is already producing 5G base stations that are free of U.S. components and plans to more than double production next year.", "authors": ["Sijia Jiang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434104197&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0SI-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
