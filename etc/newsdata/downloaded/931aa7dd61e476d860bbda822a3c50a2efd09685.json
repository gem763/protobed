But I don\u2019t think that's unreasonable,\" she says.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ever go back into strata property until the insurance problem has been solved. They can shove premiums up another 400 per cent tomorrow and no one could do anything about it. At least in a house you can decide whether or not to insure it. You can\u2019t in an apartment,\" she says.\n\nIn the most at risk areas, she says bodies corporate are now quite likely to be unable to find an insurer willing to insure the property. \u201cIf you have a strata property in Cairns close to the water, and you need a new insurance quote, you\u2019re stuffed,\" she says.\n\nCrisis point\n\nMs Shaw's views are not unusual. The insurance market in northern Australia is in a crisis so deep it has prompted the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to launch a three-year investigation into the issue. Among the worst affected are owners of units in large complexes.\n\nStrata insurance is the insurance that covers entire apartment complexes, as opposed to individual houses. As one insurer told The Australian Financial Review, large complexes pose much higher risks than single houses.\n\nFor a start, they are much larger buildings, so are more expensive to insure. But they are also more complicated than most standalone houses, with underground car parks, lifts, swimming pools, gyms and other communal facilities, all of which can be extremely costly to repair. Assessing the risk to these properties is difficult, and a number of insurers have simply stopped trying.\n\nSuncorp, one of the big three ASX-listed general insurers, falls into this category. It no longer underwrites complexes with more than 10 units, or an insured value of more than $5 million. QBE, Zurich and the major reinsurers have also pulled out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe Vella, managing director of Cairns-based Joe Vella Insurance Brokers, a member of the Steadfast network, says for bigger complexes there are now only three players in the market: SUU, Longitude and CHU.\n\n\"The premiums are excessively high. It's not uncommon to see a 400 to 500 per cent increase. If that\u2019s from $40,000 to $200,000, that\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow,\" he says. In his experience, it is always possible to find an insurer, but the cost can be eyewatering.\n\nHe says part of the problem is that strata insurance was unrealistically cheap for a long time. \"It was like buying a car with every possible accessory at a ridiculously low price, and it got the better of the insurance companies. And now it\u2019s getting the better of the customer,\" he says.\n\nCon Bochrinis, an insurance broker with Carbon Group, paints a similar picture. \"The market has contracted quite dramatically,\" he says. \"Your major insurers are not entertaining anything north of the 25th parallel, which is north of Rockhampton [in Queensland] and Geraldton [in Western Australia]. The major Australian insurers have shied away because they don\u2019t have capacity.\"\n\nHe says this trend began with Yasi, and was firmed up with Cyclone Debbie in 2017. He says cyclone and bushfire risks have scared off global reinsurers, referring to a report from Lloyd's of London that highlights Australia \"as having very bad risks\".\n\n\"The global reinsurance market started to dry up in June last year, and local insurers here don\u2019t have capacity to underwrite the risk themselves,\" he says. This has resulted in premiums leaping in some cases by almost 10 times. For many bodies corporate, this is unviable.\n\n\"The reality is they are going uninsured. If they don\u2019t have the money, what are they going to do?\"\n\nAccidental law breakers\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is putting the owners of units in a strange position. Under Queensland law, unit complexes must be insured for the full value of the property. So through no fault of their own, some unit owners are breaking the law.\n\nThe Queensland government is aware of this problem. Recently a body corporate in far north Queensland was only able to find insurers willing to cover the property for 70 per cent of its value, which would not have complied with the law. So the body corporate requested the state authorities to make an exception, and they agreed.\n\nMs Shaw says this is evidence of market failure. \"I told the Senate inquiry in 2017, just after Debbie, that insurance in north Queensland, particularly for strata, was broken. I\u2019ve been saying that since 2011, and it's still broken. When you\u2019ve got a complex that is legally underinsured, you must have market failure,\" she says.\n\nBoth Ms Shaw and Mr Bochrinis say the situation has got so bad that some sort of government intervention is required. This would involve the government stepping in, in some form, to underwrite risks that the private sector will not. The ACCC floated options along these lines in its most recent report on northern Australia. Its suggestions included a government-backed reinsurance pool or insurance mutual.\n\nRade Musulin, a natural catastrophe insurance expert with actuarial consulting firm Finity, says such models have been used in the United States, with varying degrees of success. He cites the US National Flood Insurance Program and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund.\n\nThe latter is a Florida state government-underwritten reinsurance scheme that was set up in 1993 to address a lack of capital following Hurricane Andrew.\n\n\"It is not perfect as it creates certain cross-subsidies and does displace some private reinsurance, but it is a generally successful program that has not unduly disrupted the private market,\" Mr Musulin says.\n\nHe says the US National Flood Insurance Program has solved affordability problems. But thanks largely to hurricanes Katrina and Sandy it has run huge deficits \u2013 he says its cumulative debt is more than $36 billion \u2013 and has encouraged development in high-risk areas that commercial insurers would not have touched. \"Solve one problem, but create another,\" he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Australia's case, Mr Musulin doubts the problem in Australia is really about capital. \"Australian insurers are well capitalised, and we haven\u2019t seen losses that would exceed the global reinsurance market. Losses have not been of the magnitude of a Katrina or Sandy,\" he says.\n\n\u201cIf the problem is affordability, you need some mechanism to cross-subsidise a certain group of people. Either the government can form some sort of government pool, or it could introduce rules in the market that say you can\u2019t charge so much for this product. But then if you do that, you need to find a source of revenue to fund the subsidy.\"\n\nIf that doesn't come from the government, it would have to come from policyholders in less risky regions.\n\nHovering over all this is the spectre of climate change, which Mr Bochrinis says will only compound the affordability issue as extreme weather events, from cyclones to bushfires to droughts, cause increasingly more damage, and push premiums in at-risk areas up even further. \"Climate change is real, and nobody is listening,\" Mr Bochrinis says.", "description": "Extreme weather has been making strata property in north Queensland very difficult to insure.
