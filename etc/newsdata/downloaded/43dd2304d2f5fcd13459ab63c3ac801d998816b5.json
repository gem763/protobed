A woman who was trying to cross Collins Street to make arrangements after her mother\u2019s death broke down in tears as she spoke with A Current Affair.\n\n\u201cDad passed away 10 months ago and Mum passed away on Sunday at home in that building,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be there having hospital beds picked up, mats picked up, lifting machines picked up. I heard that these d**kheads were here yesterday so I rescheduled it, and I\u2019ve come along this morning (and) they\u2019re here again.\u201d\n\nReporter Reid Butler told Sally the protest was \u201cfor the environment\u201d and \u201ccivil disobedience\u201d was the tactic.\n\n\u201cF***ing environment. People are more important,\u201d she said. \u201cThey think it\u2019s so important but what is important is the everyday, good Australian people just trying to go about their everyday lives. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\nThe protests have been carried out around the world. In London, one woman\u2019s video went viral after she shared her disgust at the protesters.\n\nShe said she had to walk 20 minutes with a cancer patient to hospital because cars were blocked from major roads.\n\n#ExtinctionRebellion - as u shut down main roads leading London hospitals, I walked 20mins with some 1 who has CANCER so they could get to hospital for a procedure, as the car couldn\u2019t get thru. 20mins might not sound long but when u hav CANCER IT IS!

We have a government that will barely acknowledge the crisis that we\u2019re living through.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to wait until the next election. We actually have to take this into our own hands and force the government into action.\u201d\n\nMore to come", "description": "Climate protesters will be out to disrupt the flow of the Melbourne CBD again this morning for a fourth day running.", "authors": ["Rohan Smith"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b2b1ec1d674226f35213b9affdcf028d?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
