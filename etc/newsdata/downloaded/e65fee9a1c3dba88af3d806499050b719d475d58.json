Bobby Rush, who\u2019s been in office for most of Emmons\u2019 life.\n\n\u201cWe know what causes gun violence in our district,\u201d Emmons said in his campaign video. \u201cIt\u2019s not lack of morals... it\u2019s systemic poverty, it\u2019s educational inequity.\u201d\n\nHe sees the solutions to gun violence in his district and beyond not as more law enforcement or even stricter gun laws \u2015 Illinois already has some of the strictest gun laws in the country \u2015 but rather as providing a living wage, making health care affordable, eliminating student debt and more.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m running: To make this the very last generation to be faced by everyday gun violence by addressing it by its root causes,\u201d Emmons told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s looking at what causes everyday gun violence: systemic poverty, a racist criminal justice system, our young people not having access to upward mobility.\u201d\n\nHe hopes to challenge the myths people perpetuate about communities like his that suffer from everyday gun violence \u2015 and what the solutions are to address it.\n\n\u201cI hear a lot of mumbo jumbo saying young people in my community that look like me lack values or morals or it lies on the parents \u2015 it\u2019s none of those,\u201d Emmons said, noting the city has under-resourced schools and lead in its drinking water. Last year, Chicago schools serving low-income Black students were twice as likely as others to have a yearlong teacher vacancy, according to NPR.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a lack of morals or values \u2015 our parents are doing the best they can in a system that isn\u2019t designed for them to be successful, to fully be in the household, because they\u2019re working two to three jobs,\u201d Emmons added.\n\nBut Emmons, who is Black, faces long odds against Rush, who is also Black and is known for his years of fighting for civil rights in the 1960s. Rush, who co-founded the Black Panther Party in Chicago in 1967 and was first elected to Congress in 1992, won the largely Democratic district last year with more than 73% of the vote.\n\nIn our community, we march for our lives every single day. We ought to live in a world in which we don\u2019t have to.\n\n\n\nJoin our pursuit of peace and be a part of the solution.https://t.co/FqSF7OI7Iwhttps://t.co/7k7jAMKy0I pic.twitter.com/YtjfWyUJ4r \u2014 Robert Emmons Jr. for US Congress (@remmons2020) August 15, 2019\n\nEmmons, born in the small town of Mays Landing, New Jersey, says he \u201cbecame the man I am today\u201d on Chicago\u2019s South Side, where he and his sister moved to live with their grandparents when he was about 13. He says that\u2019s the first time he saw everyday gun violence \u201cup close and personal.\u201d Every couple of months, his teachers would pull him and his classmates into their school auditorium to tell them someone had died in a shooting.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2017, he juggled different roles in what he calls \u201csocial innovation,\u201d including as a program manager with One Goal, a group that helps students in underserved communities get into college, which helped him as a high schooler. He also consulted with the Obama Foundation as a youth community leader.\n\nWhen asked about his opponent, Emmons started off by saying how much he respects Rush\u2019s years of activism in decades past. Rush, who was a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the 1960s, lost his son to gun violence on the South Side in 1999.\n\nBut Emmons noted Rush\u2019s support for the 1994 crime bill, which many have since criticized as leading to the over-incarceration of people of color, notably through so-called \u201cthree strikes\u201d laws that mandate harsh sentences. (In 2016, Rush said he felt \u201cashamed\u201d of voting for the bill.)\n\nHe also criticized Rush\u2019s acceptance of corporate PAC money to his campaign. Rush, who is chairman of the House subcommittee on energy, has accepted $9,000 so far this cycle from the oil and gas industry, according to Center for Responsive Politics data. (Emmons, like many recent progressive candidates, doesn\u2019t take money from corporate PACs in his campaign.)\n\nRush\u2019s campaign team didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nEmmons faces a tough path to victory in the 1st Congressional District, where former President Barack Obama, then an Illinois state senator, lost his challenge to Rush in 2000. Emmons has raised only $24,000, according to the latest campaign fundraising numbers, compared with Rush\u2019s $83,000.\n\nOther contenders in the Democratic race include Sarah Gad, a University of Chicago law student running on tackling opioid issues, fueled by her own experience with addiction; and Darnell Leatherwood, a doctoral candidate at the same school, who founded the nonprofit Black Boys Shine. Because the district is heavily Democratic, the March primary will almost certainly determine the winner of the seat.\n\nEmmons has scored endorsements from progressive groups People for Bernie and Brand New Congress. Brand New Congress had backed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) in her 2018 race, in which she successfully unseated a 10-term Democratic incumbent in Queens.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my kids having to fight for the same things we have to fight for,\u201d Emmons said, who is married but does not yet have children. \u201cAs I\u2019m marching in the streets shutting down highways screaming \u2018Black lives matter,\u2019 that\u2019s so my kids don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait our turn,\u201d he added. \u201cOur time is right now if we\u2019re going to truly change the trajectory of our future.\u201d", "description": "Robert Emmons Jr. is running for Congress in Illinois, challenging stereotypes about shootings in his hometown and seeking to unseat Democrat Bobby Rush.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da4f9c0200000c70c500c60.jpeg?cache=pbzlihgjpn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
