And if a particularly loose rumour is anything to go by, producers might be eyeing off a rather left-field choice that\u2019d see Andy Lee, of all people, having a crack at sitting in the all-important hosting chair.\n\nThe revamped version of Today, with Deborah Knight and Georgie Gardner as hosts, is all-but certain to be shaken up come the end of the year, with a number of options \u2013 even re-hiring the unceremoniously deposed Karl Stefanovic \u2013 reportedly being considered.\n\nBut while Nine (who wholly owns this publication but refuses to let me pinch-hit a weather report so I can tell everyone \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be 36 degrees\u2026\u2026. in my ASS\u201d) figures out what to do about their flagship breakfast show on a permanent basis, reports suggest that Andy Lee has, at the very least, been invited to \u201cfill in\u201d as host on the show for a hot minute or two.\n\nREAD MORE Hamish Blake Dropped An Almighty Holiday Prank On Zo\u00eb By \"Learning\" To Speak Italian\n\nLee, along with gr8 m8 Hamish Blake, is currently associated with Nine thanks to their upcoming Hamish & Andy\u2019s Perfect Week series, which is due to premiere on Nine in a couple of weeks.\n\nWhether or not Hamish has been asked to fill-in as well remains to be seen, although a version of Today hosted by Hamish & Andy sounds like the kind of glorious chaos that might actually be worth getting up at sparrow\u2019s fart to behold.\n\nThe report, from News.com.au (take with salt grains), asserts Lee has been approached about possibly pulling fill-in shifts as co-host of Today. The strong implication there being that Lee isn\u2019t being considered, or doesn\u2019t want, the full-time role.\n\nAside from the frankly shocking return of Stefanovic, other names reportedly in contention for the hosting job in 2020 include 60 Minutes reporter Allison Langdon, who got a big tick of network approval by being handed the coveted Nine Upfronts hosting job last week.\n\nHonestly? Just give the hosting gig to Brooke Boney already. A beautiful, precious gem, who we love and Stan.\n\nYou know it makes sense.", "description": "A wild rumour appears!
