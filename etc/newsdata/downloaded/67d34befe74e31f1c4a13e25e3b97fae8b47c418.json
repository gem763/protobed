If you go hand in hand with the mafia, if you destroy the lives of whole families and innocent people, you do prison according to certain rules,\u201d said Luigi di Maio, the foreign minister and head of the Five Star Movement, one half of the ruling coalition. \u201cNo prison time taken off, no conditional liberty. You pay, full stop.\u201d", "description": "Italy has reacted angrily to a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that it should relax conditions for prisoners serving life sentences, including mafia gangsters and terrorists.", "authors": ["Nick Squires", "Dominic Chorney", "Suella Braverman", "Greg Hands", "Michael Deacon"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/22/TELEMMGLPICT000000400647-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqjj7NJ3YiIjAb1WHq3sE3un-OhTnDFq3kqi6JuuVE_4s.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
