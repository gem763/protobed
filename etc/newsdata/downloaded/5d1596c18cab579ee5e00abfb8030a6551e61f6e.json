John Reed said the three rescued crew members, who were receiving medical care and in \u201crelatively good\u201d shape, spent about 35 hours trapped amid temperatures that Reed said were \u201ca lot hotter\u201d than the 120-plus degrees teams experienced outside the vessel, which was smoking and had visible flames as rescuers arrived. Two were able to crawl out of the ship onto a boat, Reed said.\n\nAuthorities made the rescue after hearing \u201ctapbacks\u201d from the trapped crew throughout the night \u2014 signs of life that gave officials new motivation and helped them pinpoint the crew\u2019s location on the large ship, according to Reed.\n\n\u201cKnowing that the people were alive made all the difference,\u201d Reed said.\n\nThe South Koreans were in a propeller shaft room near the ship\u2019s stern, Coast Guard Lt. Lloyd Heflin told the Associated Press.\n\nComplicating matters was the lack of power to the ship and its maze of compartments and watertight doors, Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Luke Clayton told CNN. And a language barrier made it difficult for the initial rescue team to communicate with the trapped crew members, Heflin told AP. But Reed said Monday afternoon that an engineer was able to speak with them in Korean.\n\nTeams drilled a two-by-three-feet hold in three-inch increments and were able to pass food and fresh water to the three now rescued, according to the Coast Guard.\n\nReed said authorities are still working to address ongoing threats to the environment and the Port of Brunswick near the overturned ship.\n\n\n\nCoast Guard crews and port partners respond to an overturned cargo vessel with a fire on board Sunday in St. Simons Sound near Brunswick, Ga.
