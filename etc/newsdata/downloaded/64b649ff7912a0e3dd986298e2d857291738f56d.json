Pramila Jayapal of Washington on a bill to cancel student debt, announced her backing of Sanders\u2019s candidacy on Tuesday, saying in a statement, \u201cBernie is leading a working-class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity, and geography.\u201d Michigan congressional representative Rashida Tlaib has yet to make her support for Sanders explicit, but Omar noted in a tweet that Tlaib was \u201con board too\u201d:\n\nOcasio-Cortez is reportedly expected to endorse Sanders this Saturday at his campaign rally in New York City; Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office hasn\u2019t publicly confirmed this decision, but the Washington Post reports that there will be a \u201cspecial guest\u201d at the rally.\n\nAs of last week, Sanders was lagging significantly behind Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren in the race to secure the Democratic nomination, polling at just 16% compared to Warren\u2019s 23% and Biden\u2019s 26%. Still, a vote of confidence from the Democratic congressional \u201cSquad\u201d\u2014which includes Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, and Tlaib as well as Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts\u2014could help him gain an advantage with younger voters.\n\nWhile Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s unabashed socialism isn\u2019t a hit with everyone, her influence on the Democratic party is hard to overstate; 34% of likely New Hampshire Democratic voters say they prefer Ocasio-Cortez to establishment leaders like Nancy Pelosi, the Boston Herald reports.\n\nSanders may hail from Pelosi\u2019s generation, but his politics are much more in line with that of Ocasio-Cortez and her young supporters; the power of the Squad could be just what Sanders needs to become a front-runner.\n\nOriginally Appeared on Vogue\n\n", "description": "Only Omar has publicly stated her support for the Democratic presidential candidate so far, but AOC and Tlaib are expected to join her by the weekend.", "authors": ["Emma Specter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yh1gh0VogrcN08aEDFtz1A--~B/aD0yNjg0O3c9NDA2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/vogue_137/c9123a6eede44589bca350a274702d50", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
