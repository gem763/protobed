Other events had more of a market impact then, and might now, too.\n\nObservers also expect little from Congress ahead of the 2020 elections, as the inquiry may sideline potential moves on drug pricing, infrastructure and the USMCA. A deal with China is still up in the air, while an already slipping Joe Biden seems to have been weakened, and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s chances seem to have brightened.\n\nU.S. futures dipped in pre-market trading on Wednesday, amid mixed reactions to the prospect of an impeachment investigation and news China is preparing to buy more U.S. pork.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample of the latest commentary:\n\nKBW, Brian Gardner\n\nKBW is \u201cconfident that regardless of whether or not the House votes to impeach Mr. Trump, the Senate will not remove him from office,\u201d Gardner wrote. He noted that using the 1998-1999 impeachment of President Bill Clinton as a proxy shows impeachment had \u201clittle impact on the market,\u201d with events connected to the Russian default crisis and the Asian financial crisis triggering greater market moves.\n\nGardner also sees Trump\u2019s reelection prospects as improving slightly, as the president \u201chas a unique ability to manipulate these kinds of situations to his advantage.\u201d A House move to impeach may backfire and unite Republicans. The news coverage is hurting Biden, he added, and helps Warren, while \u201cTrump has a better shot at beating Sen. Warren in the general election than he does against Mr. Biden.\u201d\n\nRaymond James, Ed Mills\n\n\u201cLegislating is dead,\u201d Mills wrote in a note, as \u201cimpeachment will lead to Congress doing nothing except that which it must do by established deadlines (like funding the government).\u201d That means there probably won\u2019t be bipartisan action on drug pricing, infrastructure, and passing the USMCA until after the 2020 election.\n\nRegarding China, he said, \u201cthe debate will be about a Trump pivot towards a win via a \u2018mini deal\u2019 or doubling down to cater to his base,\u201d as per his U.N. speech on Tuesday. Mills also said \u201cimpeachment is bad for Biden,\u201d as hearings will keep the \u201cTrump-claimed Biden and his son issue in the news,\u201d and undercuts Biden\u2019s \u201creturn to normalcy\u201d campaign.\n\nThere\u2019s a \u201creal risk that Democrats overplay their hand, increasing Trump\u2019s reelection chances,\u201d Mills added. At the same time, more uncertainty might hurt consumer and business confidence, he said, with any increased risk for recession possibly dooming Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nBeacon Policy Advisors\n\n\u201cThe latest impeachment imbroglio is a negative catalyst for markets,\u201d the firm wrote. \u201cWhile political gridlock is often good for markets by reducing the risk of government interference, dysfunctional paralysis of government is not because it increases uncertainty over the government\u2019s ability to handle a crisis.\u201d\n\nBeacon sees a higher risk of a \u201cTrump-induced event, akin to the government shutdown last year, in order to distract attention from the impeachment headlines.\u201d\n\nEvercore ISI, Sarah Bianchi\n\n\u201cPutting the focus on impeachment is an enormous undertaking that makes everything else harder,\u201d Bianchi wrote, including prescription drug pricing legislation and the USMCA.\n\nAs for whether it matters for the election, Bianchi said \u201cimpeachment politics are tricky and unpredictable. It is very possible that it will just further put each side in their respective camps and further polarize the country. What it does to the moderate middle of the road voters is very hard to say.\u201d\n\nCowen, Chris Krueger\n\nOn Tuesday, Krueger said he expected the House will impeach Trump, while the Senate won\u2019t convict, a scenario he called \u201cBill Clinton 2.0,\u201d adding that \u201cthis could all be over by the end of 2019.\u201d\n\nRBC, Brian Abrahams, biotech analyst\n\nInvestors may want to come back to biotech as drug pricing probably won\u2019t be overhauled now, Abrahams wrote in a note. An impeachment investigation may create \u201ca sustained impasse,\u201d he said, and \u201creaffirm the low likelihood of draconian price cuts and over time improve investor confidence returning to the biotech space.\u201d\n\nRBC, Adam Cole, currency strategist\n\n\u201cWe would note that this is only a small step on the road to impeachment, which would ultimately require a 2/3 majority in the Republican-controlled Senate and that it is not clear yet whether the House will vote to endorse the inquiry,\u201d Cole wrote. He flagged Betfair\u2019s probability of Trump leaving before the end of his first term jumping to 22% from 14%, which was \u201cstill far below levels that prevailed in the early part of his presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeyond the knee-jerk reaction to rising uncertainty, it is also unclear that diminishing risk of a returned Trump would be negative for risk assets.\u201d", "description": "Impeaching Trump Is Like \u2018Bill Clinton 2.0,\u2019 Wall Street Says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic5fcf19167ee32f061f8847423a9404b8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
