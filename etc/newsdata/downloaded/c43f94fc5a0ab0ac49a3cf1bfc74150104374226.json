Aela denied trying to single out a student as a rapist and only did so to highlight the issue of sexual assault, according to the BBC.\n\nA judge granted a temporary stay on the suspension Thursday, citing concerns over free speech, while a lawsuit filed by the girl's family against the school is still pending. Aela was unmasked after a student brought the note to school officials who identified her through camera footage.\n\nBecause of the note, \"the rumor mill spun out of control, creating fear in the high school,\" according to The Bangor Daily News.\n\nPrincipal Jeffrey Shedd initially said the three suspended girls \"made a really bad choice.\" He also determined the school was safe after interviewing roughly 47 people, according to the outlet.\n\nThe suspension of Aela led to 50 students walking out in protest over free speech rights on Oct. 7. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the school district near Portland, arguing the girl had taken a \"public stance as an ally for victims and survivors of sexual violence.\"\n\nCOLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND BARNARD COLLEGE 'HOTBED FOR HATE; REPORT DOCUMENTING 'SYSTEMIC ANTI-SEMITISM' AT THE SCHOOL SAYS\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Lance Walker blocked the suspension on Thursday citing his belief that it'll likely be overturned on the grounds of free speech and Title IX.\n\nHis ruling said the notes placed were \"neither frivolous nor fabricated, took place within the limited confines of the girls' bathroom, related to a matter of concern to the young women who might enter the bathroom and receive the message, and [were] not disruptive of school discipline.\"\n\nHe added that a \"student who expresses a comparable view in [a] similar fashion will be denied access to school simply because her viewpoint offends the sensibilities of school administrators.\"\n\nAela's mother, Shael Norris, praised the judge's decision.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"All my daughter ever wanted was for students to feel safe speaking out about sexual assault,\" she said in a statement through the ACLU. \"I'm so proud of her for standing up for what she believes in.\"", "description": "A judge has blocked the suspension of a 15-year-old high school girl who posted notes in the girl's bathroom warning of a \"rapist\" at Cape Elizabeth high school in Maine.", "authors": ["David Aaro", "David Aaro Is A Freelance Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Cape-Elizabeth-High-School-Google-Maps.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
