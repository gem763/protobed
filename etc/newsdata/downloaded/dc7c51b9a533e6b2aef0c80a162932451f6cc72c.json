I have very positive feelings about the season.\u201d\n\n(Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the kind of message Liverpool fans want to hear after almost 30 years without a league title. So, a morale-boosting victory over stuttering Tottenham, who lost to Liverpool in the Champions League final last season, could be crucial to bringing the dream a step nearer.\n\n\u201cIt would show once again that we believe this is going to be our year in the Premier League. This year is our time,\u201d insisted Firmino.\n\n\u201cBut we have to be careful. In this moment we are the leaders and we are playing well. But we haven\u2019t won anything yet. So, we are optimistic, yes - but you have to continue working game by game\n\n\u201cThinking ahead is just not worth it. I learned long ago that in England, anything can happen. Just dropping two or three points can leave you missing out on the title.\u201d\n\n(Image: Man City via Getty Images)\n\nThat\u2019s a lesson Liverpool certainly learned last year as they missed out on the title despite losing just once all campaign.\n\nSo even a draw against Spurs on Sunday or at Aston Villa next Saturday could be a massive blow before they face City in a title cruncher.\n\n\u201cThey are complicated matches we face,\u201d admitted Firmino.\n\n\u201cIf we overcome them, then the way ahead will be even clearer for us. But what we learned last season, which I have already lived many times, is that in this league the last match of the campaign can still end up defining everything.\n\n(Image: UEFA via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cMy hope is that we can be Premier League champions a few days before that. But you have to be ready to go to the end.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I prefer to be top and to lead from the front than having to chase your rival. So I am happy where we are right now.\u201d\n\nFirmino is confident, too, that Liverpool can cope with the pressure, which is growing by the day as they edge closer to an historic title win.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe good news is that this Liverpool team is super professional. We know what is required of us and the pressure we are exposed to.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThat is important because there is a lot of the season still to go, even though we have started so well.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising, given there are still almost seven months of the campaign remaining, that Firmino is anxious not to add to the hype at Anfield or to suggest the title is already in the bag.\n\nBut he has allowed himself a moment or two to think about what it would be like if Klopp\u2019s side finally broke their Premier League duck in May 2020 and the long wait was ended.\n\n\u201cIt would be a total party in the city,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething unique and even more than when we won the Champions League.\n\n(Image: Marc Atkins)\n\n\u201cBut personally I can only think about the present and I haven\u2019t thought about how I would celebrate or what I would do.\n\n\u201cLiverpool is a world-class club and the sooner we win the title the better. But we have not won it yet - and this is a very long race.\n\n\u201cSo my message to the fans is to keep supporting us. Success will come.\u201d", "description": "'This year is our time' says Brazilian striker ahead of Tottenham clash as he predicts Reds will end 30-year wait for title", "authors": ["Chris Hatherall", "Image", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images", "Man City Via Getty Images", "Uefa Via Getty Images", "Afp Getty Images", "Marc Atkins"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20733983.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-Training-Session.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
