It felt curiously like a big concrete cathedral.'\n\nThey added: 'It plays games with your mind. It's poetry in 3D.'\n\nMeanwhile the couple also built identical master bedrooms on the third floor of the property to ensure an optimum amount of sleep\n\nBut while the judges were hugely impressed by the build, viewers were a little less enthralled.\n\nOne wrote: 'This monstrosity on Grand Designs looks like someone has photoshopped three different crematoriums into one image, badly, and the regular window frames hiding behind the semi-circular openings just look like a tacky corner-cutting exercise.'\n\nOne commented: 'So a concrete box, with concrete walls, is supposed to be on the list for the award. It seems imagination has gone out of the window.'\n\nWhile the judges were impressed by Nirthurst Farm, viewers slammed the property online, with some comparing it to a crematorium\n\nAnother wrote: 'Well at least we know where to go for a cremation, not impressed.'\n\nOne added: 'Why is pouring concrete so appealing?? Looks like the inside of an old multi-storey carpark.'\n\nThey added: 'I really hope next week's show is better.'", "description": "Viewers of Grand Designs: House of the Year were baffled by the judges' enthusiasm for the six-bedroom Nithurst Farm, in Sussex, which Kevin McCloud raved about as 'poetry in 3D'.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/10/20125138-0-image-a-2_1571910930144.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
