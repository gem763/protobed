Heck, we\u2019re seeing full gymnastics routines from the Boston Dynamics Atlas now.\n\nBut why should robots be limited by their legs, even if that\u2019s their primary propulsion? That\u2019s a question Caltech is toying with on its new LEONARDO robot, short for \u201cLEgs ONboARD drOne,\u201d and this is the first real video of it in action (via BoingBoing).\n\nSimply put, it\u2019s a relatively lightweight walking robot that balances more like a drone than a typical bipedal bot \u2014 because it\u2019s literally got a set of drone propellers instead of arms. (It reminds us of this University of Tokyo bot with a quadcopter for a head.) Perhaps it\u2019s not as impressive as Disney\u2019s flying robotic stuntmen, but how often do you see a robot ballerina stand on one leg and twirl?\n\nYou can read more about the bot in stories at IEEE Spectrum and Wired from earlier this year, including how the researchers expect those thrusters might eventually help it do a whole bunch of jumping \u2014 perhaps even on Mars.", "description": "Humanoid robots have come a long, long way since Honda\u2019s Asimo took a tumble down the stairs.
