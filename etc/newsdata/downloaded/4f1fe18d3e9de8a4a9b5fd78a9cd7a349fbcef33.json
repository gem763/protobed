One minute later, Roosters fullback James Tedesco scored the match-winning try by finishing off a 60-meter movement in front of a crowd of 82,982 spectators at Sydney's Olympic stadium.\n\nThe Roosters, who sent retiring halfback Cooper Cronk out a winner, took advantage of Cummins' decision to instead rule a turnover instead of six more tackles.\n\nThe Roosters scored off the next set of tackles, with Luke Keary running down the blind side and Latrell Mitchell producing a flick pass to unlock Daniel Tupou for Tedesco to score between the posts.\n\nCronk finished his career with victory in his ninth grand final.\n\n\"We showed heart and character and stuck in there and we grabbed our opportunity and we held on in the end,\" Roosters captain Boyd Cordner said.\n\nThe Brisbane Broncos were the last team to repeat as NRL champions in 1993.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "SYDNEY (AP) - The Sydney Roosters became the first team to successfully defend its National Rugby League title in nearly 30 years after claiming a...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
