While some report optomistically about Boris Johnson\u2019s chances of getting his deal through, others are furious at what they see as \u201csabotage\u201d from Labourin the form of an alliance that could possibly push for amendments, including a second referendum.\n\nThe FT reports that things are looking fairly sunny for the prime minister: \u201cJohnson sticks to Brexit deal as faith rises in Westminster victory\u201d. The paper says: \u201cBoris Johnson will make a new attempt today to win parliament\u2019s backing for his Brexit deal, amid growing confidence in Downing Street that he can overcome a series of setbacks at the weekend and now has the support of the 320 MPs needed for victory.\u201d\n\nFinancial Times (@FinancialTimes) Just published: front page of the Financial Times, international edition, Monday 21 October https://t.co/RGfPNYb46v pic.twitter.com/XEsE6wgX3g\n\nThe Metro also reflects Johnson\u2019s optimism: \u201c\u2018Now we have the numbers\u2019\u201d, says its headline, which quotes the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab.\n\nThe Guardian reports that Labour is seeking an alliance with rebel Tory MPs and the DUP for amendments that would force Johnson to \u201cdrop the deal \u2013 or accept a softer Brexit\u201d. The paper says this decision means \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s hopes of winning a clear majority for his Brexit plan faced a new threat\u201d and \u201craises the prospect that a new alliance could form at the 11th hour, forcing the government into a softer departure or a confirmatory vote on whether to leave at all.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian (@guardian) Guardian front page, Monday 21 October 2019: Labour seeks new alliance to kill off PM\u2019s Brexit deal pic.twitter.com/I9gqvoKdzH\n\nThe i has a similar report, with \u201cLabour to back deal \u2026 if second referendum included\u201d, saying that the shadow Brexit secretary has sought amendments to the deal \u201cincluding softer Brexit and closing the \u2018no-deal trap\u2019\u201d.\n\nAllie Hodgkins-Brown (@AllieHBNews) Monday\u2019s i - \u201cLabour to back deal... if second referendum included\u201d #BBCPapers #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/G4IAxHQ3Bx\n\nOther papers are livid at the fact the deal did not pass over the weekend, and angry at what they see as Labour\u2019s attempts to, as the Daily Mail puts it, \u201ccancel Brexit by sabotaging withdrawal legislation\u201d.\n\nThe paper says that Labour plans to hijack the government\u2019s legislation with amendments to keep Britain tied to the EU\u2019s customs union \u2013 and to set up a second referendum. The paper\u2019s front page coverage employs many of the words that MPs begged Boris Johnson to stop using in an emotional parliamentary debate last month, including: \u201csabotage\u201d and \u201chijack\u201d.\n\nThe Express screams: \u201cHow dare they! New plot to hijack Brexit\u201d. The paper says the \u201cLabour plot\u201d was \u201cmet with fury last night\u201d.\n\nAllie Hodgkins-Brown (@AllieHBNews) Monday\u2019s Daily EXPRESS: \u201cHow Dare They!

The paper cites a cabinet minister who says the amendments \u201ccould leave [the prime minister] with no choice but to accept an extension and make a renewed push for a general election\u201d.\n\nAllie Hodgkins-Brown (@AllieHBNews) Monday\u2019s TIMES: \u201cDowning Street says Labour is trying to stop Brexit\u201d #BBCPapers #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/2zqXNAKGq5\n\nThe Telegraph says that Johnson faces a \u201c\u2018guerrilla war\u2019 over new vote on deal\u201d. The paper said \u201cSir Oliver Letwin, a former Conservative cabinet minister, conspired with Labour to destroy a historic weekend sitting of Parliament that had been expected finally to approve Brexit.\u201d\n\nThe Telegraph (@Telegraph) The front page of tomorrow's Daily Telegraph: 'PM faces 'guerilla war' over new vote on deal' #tomorrowspaperstoday pic.twitter.com/cJ6pbi2w9T\n\nThe Sun\u2019s lead story is \u201cBad blood brothers\u201d, about comments made by Prince Harry in an ITV documentary that he and his brother are \u201con different paths\u201d, but it does have a small front page story on the Brexit goings-on: \u201cIt\u2019s BoJo v Brexit bandits: Round 2\u201d, says the paper, which says Johnson\u2019s \u201cmove to break the deadlock could be scuppered by Commons Speaker John Bercow and Remainer MPs.\u201d\n\nThe Sun (@TheSun) Tomorrow's front page: 'Prince Harry has publicly admitted the growing rift between him and brother Wills' https://t.co/Zrkawi99OA pic.twitter.com/Hqf0X60R80\n\nThe Mirror also has the Duke of Sussex\u2019s comments on its front page, but it leads on an investigation into working conditions at Amazon\u2019s biggest UK warehouse, who have accused their bosses of \u201cmodern slavery\u201d.", "description": "Labour plans for amendments to the legislation compete with ministers talking up the PM\u2019s chances of victory", "authors": ["Kate Lyons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c04b2802b9feee1c52a6d55a3eb6bddf801a4755/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=24d79c28e6e4703a9d2343c28841dffc", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
