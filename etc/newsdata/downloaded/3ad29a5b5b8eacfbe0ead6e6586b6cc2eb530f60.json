Shulz's beloved comics, where everything from the rooms to the decor and even the food in the restaurant is themed around Snoopy and his friends.\n\nThe 18 bedrooms are basically variations of the rooms we dreamed of as kids, with Snoopy-themed wallpaper, bedding and toys.\n\nThe best part is that no two rooms are the same; each individual room is themed around a specific comic strip from the series, in a sweet tribute to the stories.\n\nThe 'It was a dark and stormy night' room re-creates the moment when Snoopy is trying to write a novel, so the bedroom features a typewriter, a corkboard showing artwork by Charles M. Shulz.\n\n(Image: Peanuts Hotel)\n\n(Image: Peanuts Hotel)\n\nThe quirky 'I did it! I'm the first beagle dog on the moon' room unsurprisingly is themed around space and has quirky nods to Snoopy's astronaut ambitions.\n\nMeanwhile, the 'Cowabunga' room takes you straight to the seaside with illustrations of Snoopy trying his hand at surfing, with bedding inspired by blue ocean waters.\n\nWhat the rooms do have in common is that there are heaps of pictures of Snoopy all over the walls, the bathrooms, even the clocks.\n\n(Image: Peanuts Hotel)\n\nOh, and of course it's not just Snoopy who makes an appearance; Charlie Brown and friends can also be found adorning the rooms.\n\nMeanwhile, the hotel's communal areas also offer up plenty of opportunity to immerse yourself in the Peanuts world.\n\nFor a start, the on-site diner has heaps of Snoopy decor, and even serves up an array of Snoopy themed dishes! Meanwhile, there are plenty of souvenirs to be found whether you're after Peanuts clothing, mugs, or even figurines start (or add to!) a collection.\n\n(Image: Peanuts Hotel)\n\nThe hotel, in the Setouchi region of Japan, takes its concept from a scene in the original comic, where Snoopy's bird friends fall asleep at his iconic dog house.\n\n\"It's nice to have a home where your guests feel comfortable,\" the iconic dog muses.\n\n(Image: Peanuts Hotel)\n\nWant to stay?\n\nPrices start from \u00a3215 per room, per night which includes breakfast at the Peanuts Diner. (However, it excludes the eight per cent tax visitors need to pay).\n\nYou can find out more on the official Peanuts Hotel website .\n\nAs for getting there? In terms of flights, your best bet is to fly to Osaka from the UK - British Airways offers direct flights with return fares from \u00a3715pp . It's then about a 40 minute drive from the airport to the Peanuts hotel.\n\nYou can find return flights to Kobe from \u00a3410pp through Skyscanner but it's worth noting that these usually include multiple stopovers.", "description": "The Snoopy themed hotel has rooms, decor and even breakfast dishes inspired by the Peanuts comics", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Peanuts Hotel"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20713422.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/9_Peanuts-Hotel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
