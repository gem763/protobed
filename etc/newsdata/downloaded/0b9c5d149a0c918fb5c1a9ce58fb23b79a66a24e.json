But it will need 95% of its unsecured bondholders to agree to swap into new payment-in-kind notes if it wants to be able to access the next $250 million of financing, said Valerie Potenza, head of high-yield research at Xtract Research. PIK notes allow borrowers to defer interest payments.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the signing up of this financing facility takes restructuring off the table,\u201d she said in a phone interview.\n\nMcDermott\u2019s stock slumped about 13% Monday and its bonds fell as investors fretted about uncertainty over its free cash flow and 2019 outlook, the high interest rates on the rescue loan, and the hurdles it faces accessing the remaining balance of the $1.3 billion term loan and $400 million in letters of credit. The company\u2019s announcement had initially boosted the shares as much as 29% and sent its bonds rallying.\n\nTo obtain the financing, McDermott projected free cash flow of negative $1.2 billion for this year, according to a presentation on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website. That\u2019s almost double the negative $640 million previously seen. It agreed to pay around 10% interest rates on the rescue loan, withdrew its annual guidance and said it was halting efforts to sell its industrial storage tanks business.\n\nWhile the financing is a lifeline that may help McDermott avoid bankruptcy, the outlook withdrawal signals \u201cnear-term performance uncertainties or working capital challenges,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Scott Levine said. The company\u2019s stock and bonds have cratered after it struggled with debt taken on from its $3.5 billion acquisition of Chicago Bridge & Iron Co. It\u2019s also grappling with reduced spending by the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe company plans to use the new funds to finance working capital and support the issuance of performance guarantees. It also awarded retention bonuses to some top executives, including $3.4 million for Chief Executive Officer David Dickson. He will receive one-third of the total bonus upon the effective date of the financing agreement, another third on the funding date of the second tranche of debt, and the rest on the funding date of the third tranche.\n\nThe initial $650 million is part of a rescue financing package totaling $1.7 billion provided by some of its existing secured lenders, according to a filing Monday. Convincing 95% of bondholders to exchange their notes is \u201cthe big first big hurdle,\u201d and it\u2019s required for the company to access the $150 million \u201ctranche C\u201d debt and $350 million \u201ctranche D\u201d debt, Potenza said.\n\nTo be sure, the company could get consent of two-thirds of its secured lenders to waive the bondholder swap requirement, but that would reduce its borrowing capacity to about $1.3 billion and constrain access to lenders of credit, which are essential to operate its business, according to Potenza.\n\nRise and Fall\n\nShares of the company tumbled as much as 14%, and ended down about 13% in New York. While its 10.625% bonds due 2024 posted the biggest gain and volume among high yield debt on Monday, they reversed that advance. They led high-yield market declines, dropping 4 cents on the dollar to about 24.5 cents. The debt now yields nearly 62%.\n\nThe company said it\u2019s still exploring a sale of its Lummus Technology unit and its pipe-fabrication business. It said last month it had received expressions of interest valuing Lummus at as much as $2.5 billion.\n\nThe company specializes in building and installing large, expensive items like oil platforms and natural gas plants. It\u2019s currently constructing Sempra Energy\u2019s giant Cameron liquefied natural gas complex in Louisiana. Lummus licenses technologies used in petrochemicals, refining and gas processing, and holds more than 3,100 patents.\n\n(Recasts with details of potential hurdles in first three paragraphs.)\n\n--With assistance from Jeremy Hill and Eliza Ronalds-Hannon.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Kriti Gupta in New York at kgupta129@bloomberg.net;Allison McNeely in New York at amcneely@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Simon Casey at scasey4@bloomberg.net, Pratish Narayanan, Reg Gale\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- McDermott International Inc.\u2019s bondholders could make it difficult for the embattled energy-industry contractor to make further draws on its $1.7 billion rescue loan.The company said Monday it received an initial $550 million term loan and $100 million in letters of credit to help stabilize", "authors": ["Kriti Gupta", "Allison Mcneely"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/k8fgta1XvxRFKwy01ssxbQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/3956b6c044edde710129e6ddf4366b85", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
