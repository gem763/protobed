WellChild is the national charity for seriously ill children and their families. Over 100,000 children and young people are living with serious and complex health conditions.\n\nMany require round-the-clock support and can spend months, if not years, in hospital because there isn\u2019t the support to get them home.\n\nThrough a nationwide network of WellChild Children\u2019s Nurses, home makeover projects and family support programmes, WellChild works to give this growing population of children and young people the best chance to thrive \u2013 properly supported at home, together with their families. WellChild was one of the four charities chosen by The Duke and Duchess of Sussex to benefit from the generous donations made by the public on the occasion of the birth of their son, Archie Mountbatten Windsor.\n\nFor more information about WellChild please visit www.wellchild.org.uk", "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have arrived at The Royal Lancaster Hotel for the annual WellChild Awards", "authors": ["Russell Myers", "Image", "James Whatling", "Justin Goff Goffphotos.Com", "James Veysey Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586115.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_PAY-Harry-and-Meghan-attend-the-WellChild-Awards.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
