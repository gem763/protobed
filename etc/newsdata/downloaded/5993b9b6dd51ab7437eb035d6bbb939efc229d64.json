The Russian national team was banned from the 2018 Olympics over doping allegations as well, and Fancy Bear launched several cyberattacks in response that year.\n\nThis time around, Microsoft notes, the group is using tactics like spear-phishing, password-spraying and malware in its attacks \u2014 methods that Burt notes are \u201croutinely used by Strontium to target governments, militaries, think tanks, law firms, human rights organizations, financial firms and universities around the world.\u201d\n\nSpecific victims of the Olympics-related hacking are not being identified for security purposes, but Burt says that Microsoft \u201chas notified all customers targeted in these attacks and has worked with those who have sought our help to secure compromised accounts or systems.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Japanese officials are reportedly scrambling to help beef up their cybersecurity ahead of the games next year. \u201cThe Japanese originally saw defending the Olympics as a way to improve their general cybersecurity skills,\u201d James Lewis from the Center for Strategic and International Studies told the MIT Technology Review. \u201cNow they\u2019re not quite in panic mode, but they\u2019re not sure if they\u2019ve done enough. But they\u2019ve got time to see if they can prop that up.\u201d\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at Forbes", "description": "In a blog post Monday, Microsoft warned that Russian hackers are targeting organizations related to the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.", "authors": ["Bonnie Stiernberg"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177304247.jpg?fit=1024%2C678", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
