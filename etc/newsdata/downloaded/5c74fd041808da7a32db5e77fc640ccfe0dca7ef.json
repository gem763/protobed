He said he had no more comment, but added: \u201cThe president should start to be president.\u201d\n\nThe existence of the complaint, submitted by a member of the intelligence community to its inspector general, emerged late last week and exploded into the open late on Wednesday when The Washington Post reported that it concerned Mr. Trump. The administration has not shared the complaint with Congress, as is generally required by law, angering Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered a sharp warning to the Trump administration on Friday, saying in a statement that the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, was violating the law by refusing to disclose the complaint to Congress.\n\n\u201cIf the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nAfter the Ukraine link emerged in news reports late Thursday, Mr. Giuliani shed more light on it in a rambling CNN appearance, where he first denied, then admitted, to asking the government in Kiev to investigate the Bidens.\n\nMr. Giuliani has spearheaded a push for such an inquiry. He met with Mr. Zelensky\u2019s emissaries this summer in hopes of encouraging his government to ramp up investigations into two matters regarding the Biden family: the question of any overlap with Mr. Biden\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Ukraine, as well as the details of his son\u2019s involvement in a gas company there.\n\nMr. Giuliani has said he was acting on his own, though his comments on Thursday seemed to draw a closer connection to Mr. Trump. \u201cA President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job,\u201d Mr. Giuliani wrote on Twitter shortly after his appearance on CNN asserting the same thought.", "description": "Mr. Trump has been prodding the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden and his family, but the new whistle-blower complaint has drastically raised the stakes.", "authors": ["Julian E.
