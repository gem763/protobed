One quarterback, two running backs, two wide receivers, and one tight end will be highlighted.\n\nFantasy Pros takes the average draft position of players from various well-known websites to draft from such as ESPN and Yahoo and averages them out. Players would be eligible for this list if their average draft position, from those websites, was more than 180 (180 players are drafted in a 10 team, 18 round draft).\n\nDon't miss our page on Facebook!\n\n\u00a9 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED", "description": "Matthew Stafford, D.J.
