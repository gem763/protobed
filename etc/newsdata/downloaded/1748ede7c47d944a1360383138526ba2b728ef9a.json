The jury deciding Morgan's fate has been sequestered after not being able to reach a verdict.\n\n2 CHICAGO GANGBANGERS EXECUTED 9-YEAR-OLD IN REVENGE KILLING AGAINST HIS FATHER'S RIVAL GANG: PROSECUTORS\n\nProsecutors said that although Morgan did not wield the gun, he had the motive for murder. He allegedly targeted the 9-year-old because his father, Pierre Stokes, belongs to a rival gang \u2013 the Killa Ward faction of the Gangster Disciples \u2013 which Morgan blamed for an October 2015 shooting that killed his brother and injured his mother.\n\nMorgan\u2019s family also arranged the purchase of the gun that killed Lee, prosecutors added.\n\nNine-year-old Lee was killed a month later, when three men drove to a park in the South Side of Chicago where he regularly went after school to play. According to prosecutors, he was lured into an alleyway and was shot in the head with a .40-caliber handgun.\n\nMorgan and Kevin Edwards, who prosecutors claimed was the getaway driver, watched from an SUV parked down the block. Edwards pleaded guilty before the trial to first-degree murder in exchange for a 25-year prison sentence, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nMorgan's attorney, Thomas Breen, tried to distance his client from the crime.\n\n\"That execution of that 9-year-old boy has to come from one singularly evil person,\" Breen told jurors without naming Doty. \"Not from a plan. His killer did so of his own volition and for his own reason. Not at the behest or help of Corey Morgan.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nProsecutors played a tape of Boone-Doty bragging to another jail inmate that he\u2019d killed the boy. Boone-Doty\u2019s lawyer dismissed the tape, saying that Boone-Doty was lying to the other inmate to make himself look tough. \u201cI\u2019m looking at him. We walking. Bop,\u201d Boone-Doty said on the tape, according to The Washington Post. \u201cHit the ground. Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop.
