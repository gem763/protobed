Yeah, yeah, granted, the person is described as a \u201csenior\u201d official, but \u201csenior\u201d could mean many things. Is the deputy assistant undersecretary in the Labor Department a \u201csenior\u201d official? I mean, arguably, no?\n\nBut that\u2019s not who we think of when we speculate about a \u201csenior\u201d official betraying the president with an anonymous critique. We think of the true power-brokers, people whose names everyone knows, because that would be the juiciest solution to the mystery of the author\u2019s identity. The book is by Ivanka. It\u2019s her passport back into Manhattan high society once this is over and she comes clean.\n\nIf you missed the op-ed last year when it was a sensation for a few days in political media (\u201cI Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration\u201d), here it is. The cover art is \u2026 understated, I guess? It feels overstated, to be honest.\n\nWe\u2019re weeks away from Trump being impeached and weeks removed from him ordering a bug-out of northern Syria that\u2019s going to let ISIS regroup and let Turkey and Russia carve up the Kurds. We don\u2019t really need a warning at this point, buddy.\n\nCNN has a few details:\n\nThe sources say that the publisher and the author\u2019s literary agents at Javelin were provided verification that the author is the same person who penned the Times op-ed, titled \u201cI Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,\u201d on September, 5, 2018\u2026 \u201cThe Author of A WARNING refused the chance at a seven figure advance and intends to donate a substantial amount of any royalties to the White House Correspondents Association and other organizations that fight for a free press that seeks the truth,\u201d [Javelin co-founder Matt] Latimer said, adding that the book \u201cwas not written by the author lightly, or for the purpose of financial enrichment. It has been written as an act of conscience and of duty.\u201d\u2026 The author\u2019s clear intention is to convince the nation to not re-elect Trump in 2020. One of the sources familiar with the book tells CNN that it is intended for two audiences, \u201cthe country in general of course and Trump voters, at least the persuadable ones. The hope is the book will get into the hands of those who are persuadables.\u201d\n\nIf the point is to influence voters, why is it being released next month instead of October 2020? Is it because the author thinks he or she might be found out and thrown off the job by then?\n\nOr is it because the author thinks Trump might be thrown off the job by Congress by then?\n\nThe Times notes, \u201cIt\u2019s unclear whether the person remains in the administration currently, given the high turnover in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, and how much additional and specific detail the book will go into regarding the president\u2019s behavior and misgivings that members of his own administration might have.\u201d That was another question I had \u2014 is this person *still* working for the administration or are they a former Trump official, which would expand the universe of suspects to figures like Nikki Haley, Kirstjen Nielsen, and James Mattis? Reporter Rosie Gray adds another good question: How much \u201cspecific detail\u201d can the author realistically provide about what\u2019s going on in the administration without dropping clues about who he or she is? The White House would obviously love to find this leaker and end the embarrassing \u201cResistance bro behind enemy lines\u201d narrative. The author will need to be scrupulously vague about specifics, in which case how interesting will this book really be? If you want to read a searing indictment of Trump by a former high official under his own name, go read William McRaven\u2019s op-ed from last week.\n\nAll of the zestiest theories about who the author might be are flawed too. It\u2019s not Nikki Haley, as some theorized when the op-ed was published last year. Haley needs to be seen as a reasonably good soldier for Trump in order to be viable when she runs for president in 2024. She\u2019d never risk the blowback from knifing him in the back this way. It\u2019s not Kirstjen Nielsen either. If anything, Nielsen *wouldn\u2019t* want to be anonymous. She\u2019s trying to rehab her image among the administration\u2019s critics. Even if it did turn out to be her, she\u2019d be attacked by amnesty shills for not having done nearly enough as DHS chief to \u201cresist.\u201d It\u2019s not Mattis, whom I\u2019m sure would consider this sort of anonymous attack to be beneath his honor. And of course it\u2019s not one of the Trump kids. Why would the most direct beneficiaries of dad\u2019s gravy train bite the hand that feeds them?\n\nOne theory I like is that it\u2019s actually a collection of several different people. That would be one way around the problem of the author identifying himself by recounting specific details known only to a select few people within the administration. If there are various authors contributing different details, the White House would have trouble identifying a single person privy to all of that information. But there\u2019s no evidence that it\u2019s multiple people instead of one. All of the press about this has referred to a single person.\n\nAnother possibility that intrigues me is that it\u2019s John Kelly, who was certainly disgruntled enough by the time he left to have a motive to rip on Trump in print. Remember, though, that Kelly supposedly has some sort of deal with Trump in which he\u2019s agreed not to cash in with a tell-all until Trump has left office \u2014 provided that Trump doesn\u2019t start badmouthing him publicly before then. If it\u2019s true that Kelly intends to make money on a book later and if it\u2019s also true that the anonymous author of the forthcoming book intends to donate most of his royalties to charitable causes, then Kelly can\u2019t be the anonymous author. He wouldn\u2019t waste material he can monetize later on a book which won\u2019t earn him much now.\n\nAlthough \u2026 it\u2019s possible that Kelly would write two books, one a \u201cwarning\u201d involving general observations he\u2019s made about Trump and later the tell-all with all the juicy details. That would solve Gray\u2019s problem about the probable vagueness of the anonymous book. Kelly\u2019s happy to keep things vague for now because he\u2019s saving the good stuff for his real book. If anything, the hype about his anonymous alter ego after the \u201cWarning\u201d book lands will help him move more units of the tell-all a few years from now once he reveals his true identity!\n\nI might end up talking myself into that theory.\n\nMy favorite theory, though, is that the anonymous author is Kellyanne Conway. I like that one because it\u2019s always been strange to see a Beltway establishment hand like Conway accustom herself so comfortably to TrumpWorld, and of course it\u2019s really, really, really strange to have her high-profile husband tearing the president to shreds every day on Twitter. How do the Conways make it work? And isn\u2019t Kellyanne worried that the GOP establishment will hate her after this? If Kellyanne is the anonymous author, everything becomes clear. She\u2019s *not* comfortable inside TrumpWorld; she\u2019s actually part of the secret Resistance, leaking to the media and writing this anonymous attack on the president. And thus it\u2019s *not* so strange that she and George make things work. They\u2019re secretly on the same team. Kellyanne will be welcomed back into the establishment with open arms once she reveals her true identity after Trump has left office. This is her ticket back to mainstream respectability!\n\nImagine how bananas it\u2019s going to be in 2021 when we find out on the same day that not only did Kellyanne write \u201cA Warning,\u201d she\u2019s also been secretly tweeting from George\u2019s Twitter account this whole time. The real George doesn\u2019t even know what Twitter is.\n\nI don\u2019t actually believe that theory. But I *want* to believe that theory. It\u2019d be the most dramatic possible development within the realm of possibility. (Melania as the anonymous author would be the most dramatic overall, but c\u2019mon. It\u2019s not within the realm of possibility.) I\u2019m going all-in on it.\n\nHere\u2019s the video version of McRaven\u2019s op-ed from a few days ago.", "description": "Re$i$tance.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/t-19.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
