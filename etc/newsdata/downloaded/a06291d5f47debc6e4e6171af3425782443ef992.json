At stake was an open seat that Republicans have held since the Kennedy administration.\n\nMr. Bishop and Republican-aligned groups invested $6 million in the race and brought Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to North Carolina to rally voters.\n\nBut pollster John Couvillon said the results out of southeast North Carolina fit a broader post-2016 trend in which Republicans have ridden to victory in special elections with the support of rural voters while hemorrhaging support in the formerly GOP-leaning suburbs.\n\nIt\u2019s not a good trade-off in presidential election years, when a far larger electorate is in play, political analysts say. Defecting Republicans in suburban areas could change the calculus in a number of key states.\n\n\u201cWhat that means at a macro level is it definitely puts Arizona in play. It also means that Donald Trump is likely going to have to spend some [campaign] funds in Georgia, Texas and North Carolina,\u201d Mr. Couvillon said. \u201cEven though I think he will ultimately win those states, the fact that you have suburbs and urban areas where white-collar professionals are deserting the Republican Party, it will have a direct impact on the presidential election in those states.\u201d\n\nDavid Wasserman of the Cook Political Report told MSNBC Wednesday, \u201cThis is a five-alarm fire for Trump in the suburbs.\u201d If the voting trends from Tuesday hold for 2020, he said, Mr. Trump would lose the state to a Democratic challenger.\n\nThose four states also will have high-profile Senate races that could determine whether Republicans keep their slim 53-47 seat majority.\n\nWith Tuesday\u2019s victory, Republicans now need to pick up 19 seats in the House to claim the majority, but a string of retirements could expand the playing field for Democrats. Republicans will have a hard time taking control of the lower chamber if they continue to lose support in the suburbs.\n\nKyle Kondik, of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, said the good news for Republicans is they most likely won\u2019t have to spend heavily in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District now that Mr. Bishop, a conservative state senator from the Charlotte suburbs, captured the seat.\n\n\u201cWith Bishop in place, the district probably isn\u2019t a major Democratic target next year,\u201d Mr. Kondik said. \u201cTrump may have helped with his late rally, but if [Mr. Trump] weren\u2019t so unpopular overall, this race may not have been such an expensive slog for Republicans in the first place.\u201d\n\nVulnerabilities for Democrats\n\nThe special election in North Carolina also exposed Democrats\u2019 continued weakness in small towns and rural areas, which have provided a reliable bulwark for Mr. Trump and other Republicans, making it that much more difficult for even moderate Democrats to win in red states.\n\n\u201cFrom a Democratic perspective, it means the epicenter of your base is becoming more urban and suburban, and they continue to hemorrhage support in the rural areas,\u201d Mr. Couvillon said. \u201cIn practical terms, that means if you are running statewide in Oklahoma, Kentucky or West Virginia, or rural Minnesota or rural Iowa, your life is getting tougher as well.\u201d\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem S. Jeffries argued that the special election in North Carolina should have never been so close and said House Democrats will have the chance to flip dozens of seats in less Trump-friendly districts next year.\n\n\u201cThey squeaked by, and I don\u2019t think any Republican in the House who\u2019s concerned about his or her electoral prospects can feel better about the situation,\u201d the New York Democrat said on Capitol Hill.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trump, who headlined an election eve rally with Mr. Bishop, expressed no doubts about what happened at the ballot box. He told reporters at the White House that the Bishop victory was \u201cincredible\u201d and a \u201ctremendous win for the Republican Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe media thought he was going to lose,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey were all set to have a big celebration with their partners from the Democrat Party.\u201d\n\nIn his postelection analysis, Mr. Wasserman said the outcome in North Carolina shows \u201cthe political environment hasn\u2019t gotten much better for Republicans since the 2018 midterms\u201d and that \u201cmany Trump voters aren\u2019t jazzed about showing up for down-ballot GOP politicians when Trump\u2019s not on the ballot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe silver lining for red-seat Republicans: Trump will be back on the ballot next fall,\u201d Mr. Wasserman said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
