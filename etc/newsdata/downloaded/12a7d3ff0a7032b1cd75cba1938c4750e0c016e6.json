Kamala Harris on Monday said she \u201cwouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s no evidence\u201d of new allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and that it\u2019s normal for victims of sexual misconduct to be hazy on details.\n\nMs. Harris is one of several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who called for Justice Kavanaugh to be impeached after the New York Times published an article over the weekend detailing new allegations that he exposed himself to a woman at a party while in college.\n\nIn an appearance on NPR\u2019s \u201cMorning Edition,\u201d Ms. Harris, a former attorney general of California, had been asked whether she was troubled by a lack of evidence.\n\nThe unnamed woman reportedly declined an interview and doesn\u2019t remember the incident, and Max Stier, a former classmate who apparently saw Justice Kavanaugh with his pants down at a party, has declined to discuss the incident publicly.\n\n\u201cThe fact that someone does not remember the details of that incident doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s a lack of evidence if there are other witnesses who can establish that the fact occurred,\u201d the California Democrat said.\n\n\u201cAnd so I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s no evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is also, I must say, very normal for someone especially someone who has been the subject of this kind of behavior to not be clear on the details.\u201d\n\nMs. Harris said that Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged that Justice Kavanaugh groped her and tried to force himself on her at a high school party in 1982, was \u201ctreated like a criminal\u201d during his confirmation process last year.\n\n\u201cI asked the director of the FBI back then on the stand whether he was able to direct the scope of the investigation himself and it became very clear it was the White House that was directing the scope of the investigation and actually limiting it to an incredible degree,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there\u2019s not been a real airing, a real investigation of these allegations and that\u2019s what troubled me so deeply.\u201d\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said in October that the FBI\u2019s reopened background investigation into Justice Kavanaugh was limited in scope, but that the process involved was standard practice.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied any and all claims of sexual misconduct.\n\nMs. Harris agreed with the notion that her calling for impeachment could be seen as political opportunism.\n\n\u201cI feel very strongly about this case \u2026 and so I\u2019m willing to take the hit,\u201d she said. \u201cI agree that some would say politically motivated.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
