Solomon is reporting (for the first time) that these documents are in direct conflict with the story Joe Biden has repeatedly told the American people.\n\nJoe Biden, as the Obama administration\u2019s point man for Ukraine, famously boasted that in March 2016, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from the country if they did not fire the Prosecutor General, Viktor Shokin. He claims he made this demand because Shokin was corrupt, rather than because Shokin\u2019s office was planning to interview his son about his questionable business arrangement with Burisma. This claim was strengthened by the fact that Ukraine is known for it\u2019s corruption.\n\nWithin a week of Shokin\u2019s firing, Burisma\u2019s legal team met with Ukrainian officials and according to the Ukrainian government\u2019s official memo of the meeting, offered \u201can apology for dissemination of false information by U.S. representatives and public figures\u201d about the Ukrainian prosecutor. Solomon reports that the legal team\u2019s efforts to secure this meeting began the same day Shokin\u2019s firing was announced. And according to this memo and the legal team\u2019s internal emails, \u201cBurisma\u2019s American team offered to introduce Ukrainian prosecutors to Obama administration officials to make amends.\u201d\n\nSolomon asks:\n\n1.) If the Ukraine prosecutor\u2019s firing involved only his alleged corruption and ineptitude, why did Burisma\u2019s American legal team refer to those allegations as \u201cfalse information?\u201d 2.) If the firing had nothing to do with the Burisma case, as Biden has adamantly claimed, why would Burisma\u2019s American lawyers contact the replacement prosecutor within hours of the termination and urgently seek a meeting in Ukraine to discuss the case?\n\nSolomon has reported before that Ukrainian prosecutors have made repeated attempts since the summer of 2018 to bring this information to the attention of the U.S. Attorney General. They even hired a retired U.S. attorney to hand deliver this material to the current U.S. attorney in New York, who according to the Ukrainian prosecutors, \u201cshowed no interest.\u201d\n\nAt that point, they contacted Rudy Giuliani.\n\nDuring their now immortalized telephone call, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Trump, \u201cI\u2019m knowledgeable about the situation. The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case.\u201d He also asked Trump to forward any relevant evidence because he plans to open an investigation into the Biden/Burisma case.\n\nIn December 2015, the New York Times reported that, within weeks of Joe Biden becoming the Obama administration\u2019s point man in Ukraine Hunter Biden had been hired by Burisma. The article said that the company and its founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, were currently under investigation by Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General\u2019s office.\n\nSolomon has received documents which he claims \u201cdetail an effort to change the narrative after the Times story about Hunter Biden, with the help of the Obama State Department. He has also sued the State Department for all records related to these meetings. He writes:\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s American business partner in Burisma, Devon Archer, texted a colleague two days after the Times story about a strategy to counter the \u201cnew wave of scrutiny\u201d and stated that he and Hunter Biden had just met at the State Department. The text suggested there was about to be a new \u201cUSAID project the embassy is announcing with us\u201d and that it was \u201cperfect for us to move forward now with momentum.\u201d\n\nSolomon published a video in April of Joe Biden bragging about his threat to withhold \u201cthe billion\u201d if Shokin wasn\u2019t fired by the time he left the country in six hours.\n\nSome media outlets have reported that, at the time Joe Biden forced the firing in March 2016, there were no open investigations. Those reports are wrong. A British-based investigation of Burisma\u2019s owner was closed down in early 2015 on a technicality when a deadline for documents was not met. But the Ukraine Prosecutor General\u2019s office still had two open inquiries in March 2016, according to the official case file provided me. One of those cases involved taxes; the other, allegations of corruption. Burisma announced the cases against it were not closed and settled until January 2017. After I first reported it in a column, the New York Times and ABC News published similar stories confirming my reporting.\n\nJoe Biden continues to cling to his story that he acted \u201cover concerns about corruption and ineptitude.\u201d\n\nHowever, Solomon\u2019s newly obtained documents contradict Biden\u2019s claim.\n\nIn a newly sworn affidavit prepared for a European court, Shokin testified that when he was fired in March 2016, he was told the reason was that Biden was unhappy about the Burisma investigation. \u201cThe truth is that I was forced out because I was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe into Burisma Holdings, a natural gas firm active in Ukraine and Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, was a member of the Board of Directors,\u201d Shokin testified. \u201cOn several occasions President Poroshenko asked me to have a look at the case against Burisma and consider the possibility of winding down the investigative actions in respect of this company but I refused to close this investigation,\u201d Shokin added.\n\nDocuments from Burisma\u2019s American lawyers corroborate Shokin\u2019s statements.\n\nThese documents also show that members of the legal team began \u201cmoving into Ukraine with intensity as Biden\u2019s effort to fire Shokin picked up steam.\u201d Solomon reports the details.\n\nBurisma\u2019s own accounting records show that it paid tens of thousands of dollars while Hunter Biden served on the board of an American lobbying and public relations firm, Blue Star Strategies, run by Sally Painter and Karen Tramontano, who both served in President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration. Just days before Biden forced Shokin\u2019s firing, Painter met with the No. 2 official at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington and asked to meet officials in Kiev around the same time that Joe Biden visited there. Ukrainian embassy employee Oksana Shulyar emailed Painter afterward: \u201cWith regards to the meetings in Kiev, I suggest that you wait until the next week when there is an expected vote of the government\u2019s reshuffle.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s Washington embassy confirmed the conversations between Shulyar and Painter but said the reference to a shakeup in Ukrainian government was not specifically referring to Shokin\u2019s firing or anything to do with Burisma. Painter then asked one of the Ukraine embassy\u2019s workers to open the door for meetings with Ukraine\u2019s prosecutors about the Burisma investigation, the memos show. Eventually, Blue Star would pay that Ukrainian official money for his help with the prosecutor\u2019s office. At the time, Blue Star worked in concert with an American criminal defense lawyer, John Buretta, who was hired by Burisma to help address the case in Ukraine. The case was settled in January 2017 for a few million dollars in fines for alleged tax issues. On March 29, 2016, the day Shokin\u2019s firing was announced, Buretta asked to speak with Yuriy Sevruk, the prosecutor named to temporarily replace Shokin, but was turned down, the memos show. Blue Star, using the Ukrainian embassy worker it had hired, eventually scored a meeting with Sevruk on April 6, 2016, a week after Shokin\u2019s firing. Buretta, Tramontano and Painter attended that meeting in Kiev, according to Blue Star\u2019s memos. Sevruk memorialized the meeting in a government memo that the general prosecutor\u2019s office provided to me, stating that the three Americans offered an apology for the \u201cfalse\u201d narrative that had been provided by U.S. officials about Shokin being corrupt and inept. \u201cThey realized that the information disseminated in the U.S. was incorrect and that they would facilitate my visit to the U.S. for the purpose of delivering the true information to the State Department management,\u201d the memo stated. The memo also quoted the Americans as saying they knew Shokin pursued an aggressive corruption investigation against Burisma\u2019s owner, only to be thwarted by British allies: \u201cThese individuals noted that they had been aware that the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office of Ukraine had implemented all required steps for prosecution \u2026 and that he was released by the British court due to the underperformance of the British law enforcement agencies.\u201d The memo provides a vastly different portrayal of Shokin than Biden\u2019s. And its contents are partially backed by subsequent emails from Blue Star and Buretta that confirm the offer to bring Ukrainian authorities to meet the Obama administration in Washington. For instance, Tramontano wrote the Ukrainian prosecution team on April 16, 2016, saying U.S. Justice Department officials, including top international prosecutor Bruce Swartz, might be willing to meet. \u201cThe reforms are not known to the US Justice Department and it would be useful for the Prosecutor General to meet officials in the US and share this information directly,\u201d she wrote. Buretta sent a similar email to the Ukrainians, writing that \u201cI think you would find it productive to meet with DOJ officials in Washington\u201d and providing contact information for Swartz. \u201cI would be happy to help,\u201d added Buretta, a former senior DOJ official. Burisma, Buretta and Blue Star continued throughout 2016 to try to resolve the open issues in Ukraine, and memos recount various contacts with the State Department and the U.S. embassy in Kiev seeking help in getting the Burisma case resolved. Just days before Trump took office, Burisma announced it had resolved all of its legal issues. And Buretta gave an interview in Ukraine about how he helped navigate the issues.\n\nAn extraordinary amount of effort was applied to shield Joe Biden and by extension (and most importantly), the Obama administration from the consequences of Biden\u2019s actions.\n\nFast forward to the present situation.\n\nJoe Biden continues to tell Americans that he forced then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire Shokin because he was corrupt.\n\nDocuments show the American legal team that represented Burisma and the interests of Hunter Biden offering \u201can apology for the dissemination of false information by U.S. representatives and public figures\u201d about the Ukrainian prosecutor. Additional records plus a beehive of activity involving lobbyists, diplomats and both U.S. and Ukrainian government officials corroborate this document.\n\nWho would you believe?", "description": "Newly Obtained Documents from Burisma\u2019s Legal Team, State Dept and Ukrainian Government Torpedo Joe Biden\u2019s Story", "authors": ["Elizabeth Vaughn", "Brandon Morse", "Nick Arama", "Alex Parker", "Sister Toldjah", "Stu Cvrk", "Posted At Am On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/joe-biden-e1567704712668.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
