Giuliani on Saturday amid reports that federal prosecutors are investigating whether the former New York City mayor broke lobbying laws in his efforts to oust the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yavonovitch.\n\n\u201cSo now they are after the legendary \u2018crime buster\u2019 and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cHe may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer.\u201d\n\nIn defending Giuliani, Trump revived one of his recurring conspiracy theories that a \u201cDeep State\u201d of entrenched bureaucrats and law enforcement officers are continuing to undermine him and his associates. \u201cSuch a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!\u201d he said.\n\nSo now they are after the legendary \u201ccrime buster\u201d and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani. He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer. Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2019\n\nHis vocal defense of the embattled attorney comes just a day after he seemed to put distance between himself and the former mayor when asked if Giuliani still worked for him. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t spoken to Rudy. . . . He has been my attorney,\u201d the president said.\n\nFollowing those remarks, Giuliani told The Washington Post that he was still Trump\u2019s lawyer.\n\nThe president\u2019s tweet follows a report in The New York Times that federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating Giuliani's efforts to have Yavonovitch recalled in a broader effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating former vice president Joe Biden's son, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nTwo of Giuliani's associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested on Wednesday on charges of campaign finance violations. According to an indictment that federal prosecutors unsealed Thursday, the men were working for Ukrainian officials to remove Yovanovitch from her job.\n\nGiuliani has admitted to trying to oust Yovanovitch but denies violating foreign lobbying disclosure laws because he was acting on behalf of the president, not a former Ukrainian prosector whom he has worked with who opposed Yovanovitch, he told the Times.", "description": "The president\u2019s support for the embattled attorney comes just a day after he seemed to put distance between himself and the former mayor when asked if Giuliani still worked for him.", "authors": ["John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YLsfs9O3O1m5KgyukT-ks_yVObU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B6DBQVHNBQI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
