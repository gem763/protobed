Other data on Thursday showed an unexpected decline in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week.\n\nLayoffs remain low even as companies are becoming hesitant to hire more workers because of a slowing economy. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low of 3.5%.\n\nThe longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, is under threat from the 15-month-old U.S.-China trade war, slowing growth overseas and a likely disorderly exit from the European Union by Britain. The trade war has undermined business investment and helped to drive manufacturing into recession. Growth is also being restricted by the fading stimulus from last year\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut package.\n\n\u201cThe downside risks from slower global growth, trade disruptions and the contraction in U.S. manufacturing could carry more weight among Fed officials,\u201d said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cThe odds of a rate cut in October are moving up with domestic economic data turning softer in recent months.\u201d\n\nThe Labor Department said the flat consumer price index last month was the weakest reading since January and came as increases in the cost of food and rents were offset by decreases in the prices of gasoline and used cars and trucks. The CPI edged up 0.1% in August. In the 12 months through September, the CPI increased 1.7% after advancing by the same margin in August.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI nudging up 0.1% in September and rising 1.8% on a year-on-year basis.\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI climbed 0.1% after gaining 0.3% for three straight months. The so-called core CPI was restrained by moderate gains in healthcare costs, as well as declines in apparel, new motor vehicles and communications prices. In the 12 months through September, the core CPI increased 2.4%, matching August\u2019s rise.\n\nThe report came on the heels of data on Tuesday showing the biggest drop in producer prices in eight months in September.\n\nMinutes of the U.S. central bank\u2019s Sept. 17-18 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed that while officials agreed risks to the economy \u201chad increased somewhat,\u201d they were divided on what the appropriate response should be.\n\nThe minutes showed \u201cseveral\u201d favored keeping rates unchanged at that meeting as they felt the policy stance was \u201calready adequately accommodative,\u201d while a \u201ccouple\u201d preferred a 50 basis point rate cut.\n\nThe Fed cut rates by a quarter point last month after reducing borrowing costs in July for the first time since 2008. A further reduction is expected at the Oct. 29-30 meeting.\n\nU.S. stocks rose after President Donald Trump confirmed he would meet Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Friday for further trade talks, raising hopes for a deal. The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.\n\nLAYOFFS REMAIN LOW\n\nThe Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2.0% inflation target. The core PCE price index rose 1.8% on a year-on-year basis in August and has fallen short of its target this year.\n\nEconomists said based on the CPI and PPI data, they expected the monthly core PCE price index to tick up 0.1% in September, matching August\u2019s gain. That would lower the annual increase in core inflation to 1.7% from 1.8% in August.\n\nWhile benign inflation has increased households\u2019 purchasing power and boosted consumer spending, it has led to moderate annual increases for Americans receiving Social Security benefits. Based on July, August and September inflation data, recipients could see a 1.6% cost of living adjustment in the new fiscal year, according to Labor Department calculations.\n\nEconomists expect inflation will pick up and breach the Fed\u2019s target in 2020 following the recent broadening of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to include a range of consumer goods. A tightening labor market is also expected to support inflation.\n\nIn another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended Oct. 5.\n\nEconomists had forecast claims unchanged at 219,000 in the latest week. Employers are holding on to their workers, even as demand for labor is ebbing.\n\n\u201cWhile the claims data have been upbeat, we still have seen job growth slow lately, with this cooling tied primarily to reduced hiring rather than increased layoffs,\u201d said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.\n\nJob openings fell to a 1-1/2-year low in August. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 136,000 jobs in September, down from 168,000 in August. The three-month average gain in private employment fell to 119,000, the smallest since July 2012, from 135,000 in August.\n\nFILE PHOTO: People wait in line to attend TechFair LA, a technology job fair, in Los Angeles, California, U.S., January 26, 2017.

Owners\u2019 equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.3% in September after rising 0.2% for two consecutive months.\n\nHealthcare costs climbed 0.2% last month after jumping 0.7% in August, which was the biggest gain in three years. Apparel prices fell 0.4% after gaining 0.2% in the prior month.\n\nUsed motor vehicles and trucks prices decreased 1.6% in September, the most in a year, after rising for three straight months. Prices for new motor vehicles dipped 0.1%.
