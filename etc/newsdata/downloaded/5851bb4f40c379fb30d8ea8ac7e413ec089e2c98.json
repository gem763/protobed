I know that most people in Minnesota are proud and supportive of America\u2019s leadership in helping the 70 million displaced people in the world,\u201d Stiller\u2019s screed began.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that false narratives about the danger of resettlement, that have no statistical evidence, and claiming that vetting is not extreme or rigorous enough, stoke the flames of division, and appeal to our lowest instincts. It\u2019s not true,\u201d Ben Stiller said.\n\n\u201cOur country is made up of immigrants and refugees, and we have always welcomed them in a safe, and beneficial ( if not perfect) way for all involved. This is the message our president needs to spread. Not hate, fear and division,\u201d the Saturday Night Live alum concluded.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that false narratives about the danger of resettlement, that have no statistical evidence, and claiming that vetting is not extreme or rigorous enough, stoke the flames of division, and appeal to our lowest instincts.
