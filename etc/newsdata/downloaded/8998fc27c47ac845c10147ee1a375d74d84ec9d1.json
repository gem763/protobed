Citi's rosy outlook for gold does see \"clear risks\" from a hawkish pivot by the Federal Reserve and upgrades in global growth expectations, the analysts noted. A surprise deal ending the trade war would suggest a price peak at $1,550 per ounce, they added.\n\nThe precious metal is a popular \"safe haven\" investment during times of economic volatility, as its physical scarcity and steady demand appeals to those looking to escape tanking markets.\n\nThe People's Bank of China has been stockpiling gold in its reserves for eight months in a row, signalling the nation expects continued market volatility and a prolonged trade war with the US.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nWendy's nosedives after slashing its profit outlook amid plans to expand its breakfast line nationwide\n\nWall Street's biggest Boeing bull breaks down why the 737 Max fiasco has created a great buying opportunity\n\nYouTube creator Natalie Barbu breaks down how much money she earns from a video with 100,000 views", "description": "Gold could hit historic highs and even break $2,000 per ounce in the next couple years if recession risks and rate cuts continue, analysts at Citi said in...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d77d5eb2e22af02273b7b5e-2400/2019-09-05t161738z1lynxnpef841mortroptp4crypto-currencies-paxos.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
