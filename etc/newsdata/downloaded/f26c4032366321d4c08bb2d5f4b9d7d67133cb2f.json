The 27-year-old said the dogged bear even tried to hold him underwater.\n\n\"I think it was trying to hold me underwater. I was already physically tired and kind of out of breath from when I ran away and then the next thing I know I'm...going to try to get drowned by a frickin' bear,\" he told the news outlet.\n\nLattie said he noticed \"there was at least a foot or two of water above me\" and pushed himself \"back up to fight back.\"\n\nIt was then, Lattie said, he resorted to begging.\n\n\"You don't have to do this,\" he said he told the bear. \"You don't want to do it.\"\n\nCANADIAN MAN'S POCKETKNIFE HELPS HIM SURVIVE GRIZZLY ATTACK\n\nA family said they were nearby and saw Lattie running away from the bear in the lake. Lucky for Lattie, the family's dog began to bark, distracting the bear and giving the 27-year-old a chance to break free and swim to a dock.\n\n\"It could have been a whole lot worse,\" Lattie said. \"As soon as I got hit, I just thought, 'OK, this is where I die. This is where my head gets chewed apart.'\"\n\nSeparately, a 62-year-old Minnesota woman, Catherine Sweatt-Mueller, was killed by a black bear on Sept. 1 while on Red Pine Island in the Canadian waters of Rainy Lake.\n\nExperts say the attack was extremely rare and the bear was being sent for a necropsy to determine a reason for the animal's abnormal behavior.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBlack bears, according to Dave Garshelis, a bear research scientist with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, are \"very unaggressive\" and tend to be timid around people.\n\nGarshelis said that, on average, a fatal attack by a black bear happens about once a year in all of North America.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A Canadian man fighting for his life begged\u00a0his assailant to let him go, but his pleas\u00a0went unheeded \u2014 which is probably because\u00a0black bears\u00a0don't understand English.", "authors": ["Nicole Darrah", "Nicole Darrah Covers Breaking", "Trending News For Foxnews.Com.
