Ripken ordered the trial to be broken into two proceedings.\n\nThe first would set out to determine whether he committed the crimes and the second would focus on whether he lacked the \u201csubstantial capacity\u201d to appreciate the criminality of his conduct.\n\nRamos had a longstanding dispute with the Capital Gazette over a 2011 article in the paper that detailed a harassment charge a woman had filed against him.\n\nAuthorities said he sent threatening letters to the paper before arriving at the news offices on June 28, 2018 and opening fire on employees.", "description": "Oct. 28 (UPI) \u2014 The Maryland man charged with killing five people at the Capital Gazette newspaper offices last year pleaded guilty on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
