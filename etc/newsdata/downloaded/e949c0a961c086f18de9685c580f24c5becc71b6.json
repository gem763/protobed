A week after their brilliant victory over Manchester City, the Canaries were undone by two early Chris Wood goals \u2013 his first of the season \u2013 and remain without a point on the road. The result brought Burnley a first victory since the opening day of the season and, for 24 hours at least, a place in the top half of the table.\n\nManchester City hit eight past Watford as Bernardo Silva scores treble Read more\n\nThe Clarets began with an intensity Norwich could not match. They could still have taken the lead, Teemu Pukki denied by Nick Pope in the first 10 minutes, but it was no surprise when Wood headed in the opener from Ashley Westwood\u2019s corner.\n\nThe Norwich treatment room gained another customer 12 minutes in when Alex Tettey went off to be replaced by Moritz Leitner. Two minutes later Burnley grabbed their second and again Norwich\u2019s defenders seemed strangely unconcerned by Wood as he strode across the area to sweep in Dwight McNeil\u2019s low cross.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been working diligently and Barnesy\u2019s [Ashley Barnes] been getting the praise,\u201d said Sean Dyche. \u201cI\u2019m pleased for Woody, he\u2019s stuck at it and he got two really good goals.\u201d\n\nThrough McNeil, Burnley twice came close to a third: Tim Krul reacted to keep out Jack Cork\u2019s neat flick before Jamal Lewis prevented Hendrick heading into an empty net.\n\nLeicester\u2019s fast start continues as James Maddison sinks Spurs with late stunner Read more\n\nNorwich finally put a move together in the Burnley half in the 22nd minute and very nearly profited but Leitner\u2019s 25-yard effort, which took a deflection, crashed against Pope\u2019s post.\n\n\u201cOf course we are disappointed with the result,\u201d said Daniel Farke. \u201cIt was a close game I think but my feeling was the first 15 minutes were crucial today and the first 15 minutes cost the game.\n\n\u201cWe had the first big chance in the game and Pope made a world-class save. It would have been a completely different game. But my feeling is we didn\u2019t start proactive enough so were always a bit slow and not really convinced to play our style.\u201d\n\nThe latter stages of the half saw improvements from Norwich and good play from Emiliano Buend\u00eda ended with a shot that was blocked by Ben Mee.\n\nBuend\u00eda then curled an effort wide at the start of the second half but Burnley looked just as likely to add a third. A crisp one-two between Barnes and Wood saw the former curl a shot just past the angle, while Wood spurned a great chance for a hat-trick by shooting straight at Krul. David Coote, the referee, then waved away penalty appeals after Barnes appeared to be felled in the area by Ben Godfrey and decided against a VAR check. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of VAR but I don\u2019t know where it lives if that\u2019s not a penalty,\u201d said Dyche.", "description": "Two goals from Chris Wood were enough to take Burnley to a convincing 2-0 win over Norwich City in the Premier League", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc749c31d9c2de70e1d33e0ef86cd5b9bdfdbac/0_142_4272_2563/master/4272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e37adac11de7fcff3774535d5cea34ee", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
