This is the book the government does not want you to read: (link corrected) https://t.co/JS1AJ6QlXg \u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 17, 2019\n\n\"Had Mr. Snowden believed that the government would review his book in good faith, he would have submitted it for review,\" said Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, who is representing Snowden. \"But the government continues to insist that facts that are known and discussed throughout the world are still somehow classified.\"\n\n\u201cMr. Snowden wrote this book to continue a global conversation about mass surveillance and free societies that his actions helped inspire,\" Wizner added. \"He hopes that today\u2019s lawsuit by the United States government will bring the book to the attention of more readers throughout the world.\u201d\n\nThe publisher Macmillan and its parent company Holtzbrinck Publishing Group did not immediately respond to requests for comment from ABC News on Tuesday.\n\nSnowden still faces charges of espionage and theft of government secrets following his leak of thousands of highly classified government documents that detailed extensively the operations of several United States' surveillance programs in 2013.\n\nLong vilified by current and former members of the intelligence community, Snowden has continued his advocacy for government transparency and pro-whistleblower measures from his home in Moscow. But in the civil suit filed Tuesday, federal prosecutors say public remarks where he has discussed his tenure with the C.I.A. and N.S.A. amount to a violation of his employment agreements.\n\n\u201cThe United States\u2019 ability to protect sensitive national security information depends on employees\u2019 and contractors\u2019 compliance with their non-disclosure agreements,\" Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Division said Tuesday. \"We will not permit individuals to enrich themselves, at the expense of the United States, without complying with their pre-publication review obligations.\u201d\n\nThe government has had some success in the past when demanding profits from employees, including military officials, who they say have violated their signed non-disclosure agreements.\n\nIn 2016, former Navy SEAL Matt Bissonette was forced to pay more than $6.6 million and any future royalties to the U.S. government for his book \"No Easy Day,\" detailing his experience in the Osama bin Laden raid.\n\nBissonnette acknowledged in a settlement that the book, which was found to have contained some classified information, was never submitted for a pre-publication review.", "description": "The U.S. government has filed a civil lawsuit against NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and the publishers of his new memoir.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/edward-snowden-rt-jt-190917_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
