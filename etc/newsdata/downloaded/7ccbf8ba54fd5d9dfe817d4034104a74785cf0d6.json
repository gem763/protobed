Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer\u2019s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients' immune systems responded by producing \"killer\" T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting \u201caggressively growing\u201d tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany Rex 46/47 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson\u2019s Scientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson\u2019s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are \u2018excited\u2019. Today\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain. PA 47/47 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetes A new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels.

That simply isn\u2019t fair, and the cost of about \u00a3150 per dose is unaffordable for many.\u201d\n\nSurveys conducted by the charity suggested three in four males aged 13 to 24 would want to be vaccinated if it was available for free.\n\nBut when forced to pay for the jab, 46 per cent said they would remain unvaccinated, potentially leaving millions at risk from HPV-related cancers.\n\nThe charity said that when the HPV vaccination programme for girls was rolled out by the NHS, girls in older school years could have it for free through a catch-up programme, but this was not being extended to a generation of boys.\n\nThe World Health Organisation estimates the HPV virus causes about 5 per cent of all cancers.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It is a cause of oral cancers, which have risen by 30 per cent since the early 1990s, with two-thirds of cases in men, according to Cancer Research UK.\n\nGay and bisexual men are particularly at risk from a range of HPV-related cancers. Research suggests men who have sex with men are 15 times more likely than heterosexual men to develop anal cancer, which HPV causes in 90 per cent of cases.\n\nMs Collins\u2019 argued that the decision to deny older teenage boys the vaccine was based on a \u201cfalse presumption\u201d about their sexual partners.\n\n\u201cNot vaccinating older teenage boys puts them at risk as it relies on the false presumption they will only have sexual partners who don\u2019t have HPV,\u201d Ms Collins said.\u200b\n\n\u201cIt undermines the UK\u2019s progress on reducing HPV-linked cancers, such as cervical cancer, as this \u2018missing generation\u2019 of boys can get and share HPV with others who\u2019ve not been vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cFrom this year, we are making the HPV vaccine available to all boys in year 8. Extending the vaccine to boys aged over 13 would only have a limited benefit as older boys and young men are already protected by herd immunity \u2013 built up by 10 years of the girls\u2019 successful vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cOur vaccine programme has led to a significant fall in HPV infections in young women, which will help to prevent cancers in both men and women in years to come.\u201d\n\nLGBT+ campaigners have long been arguing for men to receive the HPV jab, and in June 2018 the government began slowly rolling out free vaccinations for gay and bisexual men on the NHS.\n\nThe Teenage Cancer Trust is also concerned about low awareness of HPV, particularly in boys, and its known links to a range of cancers.\n\nIt found that almost one in three teenagers and young adults said they have not heard of the virus.\n\nOf those teenagers and young adults who thought the HPV vaccinations protected people from infections that can cause cancer, half believed it is only effective for girls and women, the charity added.\n\nCampaigners warned that failing to extend the HPV vaccination programme to all 13- to 24-year-old boys and men \u201ccontradicted the NHS\u2019s own message that universal vaccines are for the common good\u201d.\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "A \u201cmissing generation\u201d of more than a million teenage boys will\u00a0not get\u00a0potentially life-saving vaccinations, a charity has warned. Boys aged 11 to 13 will be given the\u00a0human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine free of charge across the UK for the first time from September.\u00a0Girls of the same age have received the vaccine\u00a0since 2008.", "authors": ["Andy Gregory"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/01/14/vaccine.jpg"}
