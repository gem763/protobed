But while she served jail time, lawyers don\u2019t expect Huffman to go to prison, and that doesn\u2019t surprise Williams-Bolar.\n\n\u201cThe justice system is not just for everyone,\u201d she tells TIME.\n\n\u201cI was a divorced mom, a black mom, living in an inner-city, just trying to make my way, trying to go to college, trying to start over again, and the justice system didn\u2019t have any mercy on that at all,\u201d she says.\n\nHuffman\u2019s sentencing in federal court in Boston will be the first test of whether any parents swept up in the cheating and bribery scheme will serve time. More than 30 parents were charged in the case, which has drawn national attention and fueled debates about racial and economic inequality in higher education and the criminal justice system.\n\nHuffman, 56, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for paying $15,000 to have a proctor correct her daughter\u2019s SAT answers in 2017. Prosecutors have asked that she be sentenced to one month in prison, followed by 12 months of supervised release and a fine of $20,000. Huffman\u2019s attorneys have said she doesn\u2019t deserve prison time and have asked for one year of probation, 250 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine instead.\n\nBut for wealthy parents who could buy their children \u201cevery conceivable legitimate advantage,\u201d federal prosecutors have argued that \u201csome period of incarceration is the only meaningful sanction for these crimes.\u201d\n\nAnticipation that Huffman and other parents charged in the scandal could receive light sentences has sparked comparisons to cases involving non-white, non-wealthy parents who\u2019ve spent time behind bars for registering their children in different school districts than the ones in which they live.\n\nWilliams-Bolar, who is now 48, was sentenced to 10 days in jail, three years probation, and fined $70,000 in 2011 after she was found guilty of grand theft and tampering with evidence for registering her two daughters under their grandfather\u2019s address, so they could attend a better school in a safer neighborhood. She spent nine days behind bars before then-Gov. John Kasich intervened and reduced the conviction to a misdemeanor.\n\n\u201cOverzealous prosecution for my situation,\u201d she says of the case that prosecutors brought against her.\n\nThe ordeal still plagues Williams-Bolar. Her mugshot goes viral each year when new students arrive at the Akron high school where she now works as a teaching assistant, she says.\n\n\"Neither probation nor home confinement (in a large home in the Hollywood Hills with an infinity pool) would constitute meaningful punishment.\"\n\nWilliams-Bolar thinks there should be consequences for parents who cheated or bribed athletic coaches to get their children into college, but she isn\u2019t sure prison is the answer.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, they are parents. They made a mistake and if they\u2019ve never done anything before, then how do you judge?\u201d she says. \u201cBut just make sure the punishment fits the crime.\u201d\n\nTo prosecutors, that means incarceration, especially for this band of defendants.\n\n\u201cIn the context of this case, neither probation nor home confinement (in a large home in the Hollywood Hills with an infinity pool) would constitute meaningful punishment or deter others from committing similar crimes,\u201d prosecutors wrote in Huffman\u2019s sentencing memo. \u201cNor is a fine alone sufficient to reflect the seriousness of the offense or to promote respect for the law. Even a fine at the high end of the applicable Guidelines range would amount to little more than a rounding error for a defendant with a net worth measured in the tens of millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nBut legal experts note that Huffman was less involved in the scheme than some parents, and she paid a comparatively small amount of money in a scam where bribes reached $6.5 million. And the first person to be sentenced in the case\u2014a former Stanford sailing coach who allegedly accepted more than $600,000 in bribes that went to the sailing program\u2014also got no prison time. That makes it doubtful Huffman will serve time.\n\n\u201cUnder the federal sentencing guidelines, [Huffman] absolutely is eligible for no jail, and she has demonstrated the acceptance of responsibility and contrition that is genuine and judges like to see,\u201d says Jacob Frenkel, a former federal prosecutor who now specializes in white-collar criminal defense.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the judge is well aware that no prison at all could mean a headline that reads \u2018no jail in college admissions cheating scandal,\u2019 and the judge is very much aware of the intense scrutiny that will attach to a sentencing decision.\u201d\n\nDoug Berman, a Moritz College of Law professor who studies criminal sentencing, says \u201ca judge could conclude that a token amount of prison time really isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d\n\nNo matter what happens, Huffman\u2019s sentence is likely to set the tone for the defendants who will follow.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s no doubt that this will set a benchmark,\u201d Berman says.\n\nWrite to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com.", "description": "Felicity Huffman's sentencing will be the first test of whether parents involved in the college admissions scandal serve time in prison", "authors": ["Katie Reilly"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/gettyimages-1143457484-1.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
