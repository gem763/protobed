In a worst-case scenario, it could take lorries up to two-and-a-half days before being able to cross into France\n\nWhat's being done:\n\nTo ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that 88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system.\n\nThe Port of Dover in Kent handles approximately 10,500 lorries a day. To prevent nearby roads from clogging up, the government has a traffic management plan codenamed Operation Brock.\n\nIf the plan is activated, up to 2,000 lorries will be held in a queue leading to the port. Other traffic will be kept flowing around the queued-up lorries, in what is known as a contraflow system.\n\nA fallback option would be to divert lorries to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate - and use it to hold up to 6,000 lorries on the runway at any one time.\n\nIf further capacity was still required, a \"last resort\" would be to turn the 10-mile M26 motorway into a temporary lorry park.\n\nBut there is a still a lot of confusion, according to Rona Hunnisett, from the Freight Transport Association.\n\n\"The report shows there's still significant detail to be clarified if Britain is to keep trading efficiently,\" she says. \"Businesses can only prepare for, and implement, new processes once, and still need confirmation of what they are to adopt in the way of new practices.\"\n\nFood\n\nWhat Yellowhammer document says:\n\nCertain types of fresh food supply will decrease\n\nKey ingredients may be in shorter supply\n\nThere will not be an overall shortage of food in the UK, but may be reduced availability and choice\n\nPrices may increase \"which could impact vulnerable groups\"\n\nWhat's being done:\n\nThe government has said that it will continue to recognise EU standards for food being imported into the UK, to minimise disruption.\n\nThe British Retail Consortium has said retailers are doing all they can to prepare for no-deal, but will not be able to prevent all negative effects. It stresses that many fresh fruits and vegetables will be out of season in the UK and that there will be a shortage of warehouse space ahead of Christmas.\n\n\"No deal Brexit would be extremely disruptive to the supply chains that we operate, particularly the fresh food supply chains,\" Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's told BBC News.\n\n\"There will inevitably be disruption simply because we've never done this before,\" he added, although he also said that previous delays to the Brexit date mean \"there's probably more understanding of what could go wrong and therefore more contingency planning\".\n\nAnother factor is what tariffs (the taxes on imports) will be charged on food coming into the UK.\n\nThe government published a \"tariff schedule\" in March, which removed most tariffs on imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit\n\nThat means some food from outside the EU that currently attract a tariff could be cheaper, but some goods from the EU that are currently imported with 0% tariffs, like beef and dairy, will now carry tariffs, and so could become more expensive.\n\nHealthcare\n\nWhat Yellowhammer document says:\n\nSupply chains for medicines and medical products are \"particularly vulnerable\" to disruption at the Channel ports\n\nWhile some products can be stockpiled, others cannot because they have a short shelf life\n\nIt will not be practical to stockpile products to cover expected delays of up to six months\n\nAn increase in inflation would \"significantly impact\" adult social care providers and may lead to some failing, with smaller providers impacted within two-three months.\n\nWhat's being done:\n\nAt the end of June, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) started putting out contracts for freight, warehouse space and fridges. These will be used to stockpile medicines and fly in those which cannot be stored, like radioisotopes for cancer treatment.\n\nOf the \u00a32.1bn pledged for no-deal preparations, \u00a3434m has been set aside for this.\n\nThat includes a \u00a325m contract for planes to bring in emergency medical supplies within 24 hours.\n\nAhead of the UK's original departure date of 29 March - then extended to 12 April - the DHSC said thousands of medicines had been analysed to work out what might be affected by supply disruption from the EU.\n\nSuppliers stockpiled an additional six weeks' worth of these drugs over and above the usual \"buffer\" stock.\n\nThis exercise is being repeated to ensure the department is \"as prepared for leaving the EU without a deal in October as it was on 29 March and 12 April\".\n\nSpecific ferry routes were made available for suppliers to book onto 11 weeks before the no-deal deadline in March.\n\nSix weeks before the 31 October deadline, the government had only just opened the bidding process to freight firms competing to transport medicines. So the pharmaceutical industry doesn't currently know which ports and ferry routes will be made available.\n\nSteve Bates, an industry official working with government on no-deal planning, said the time frame to make sure everything was in place for the October deadline was \"significantly compressed\".\n\nHe said the difference for drug suppliers between three months and potentially three weeks to put plans into action was \"material\".\n\nOn social care, the government website advises providers to draw up contingency plans and support EU staff who may be working for them.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Plans are in place to ensure there are enough essential medicines like insulin\n\nEnergy\n\nWhat Yellowhammer document says:\n\nThere will be no immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies\n\nHowever, there are likely to be significant price rises if the UK splits from the EU single energy market, which could happen months or years after Brexit\n\nThis could lead to some energy companies leaving the market\n\nPublic water supplies are likely to remain largely unaffected\n\nWhat's being done:\n\nIn the event of no-deal, the UK has said it will not impose tariffs on electricity and gas coming into the country.\n\nHowever, if the value of the pound falls in response to a no-deal Brexit, it will become more expensive to import energy from abroad.\n\nThe government intends to remain part of the single energy market, in order for the UK's energy laws to continue to work after Brexit and that supplies are not disrupted.\n\nWater is unlikely to be affected, although there is still a low risk in the event of a chemical supply problem. The Yellowhammer report says water companies are well-prepared and have significant stockpiles of critical chemicals.\n\nIrish border\n\nWhat Yellowhammer document says:\n\nThe government's planned short-term solution for the border is likely to be unsustainable because of the \"economic, legal and biosecurity risks\" it presents\n\nTrade between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic will be \"severely disrupted\"\n\nSome businesses will stop trading, some will move and some will experience higher costs that they may pass on to customers\n\nAgriculture will be hardest hit, leading to job losses, protests and direct action with road blockages\n\nGrowth of the \"illegitimate economy\" around the border \"where criminal and dissident groups already operate\"\n\nWhat's being done:\n\nThe UK government has said it is committed not to have any physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nOn 13 March it published its contingency plan to avoid a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It said it would not bring in new checks or controls, or require customs declarations for any goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland, in the event of no-deal.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nBut this will only be a temporary measure while negotiations take place to find longer-term solutions.\n\nTo protect people's health, some plant and animal products that come into Northern Ireland from outside the EU, via Ireland, will still need to be checked. The UK government has said these checks will not happen at the border itself, but it has not specified exactly where they will take place.\n\nIt remains unclear what will happen to goods travelling from Northern Ireland to Ireland. Under EU rules, checks would normally be required at the point certain goods enter the EU single market.\n\nThe Irish government says it is securing additional space, and has recruited more customs and agriculture staff to allow for a \"significant increase in checks and procedures\".\n\nPublic order\n\nWhat Yellowhammer document says:\n\nProtests and counter-protests likely across the UK\n\nMay be a rise in public disorder and community tensions\n\nInformation-sharing between UK and EU law enforcement will be disrupted\n\nWhat is being done:\n\nThe National Police Coordination Centre will plan the allocation of officers across the country although it has said there has been no intelligence to suggest that any protests will not be peaceful.\n\nThe government has also established the International Crime and Coordination Centre, which is supposed to help the police cope with the change to the UK's relationship with law enforcement agencies in the EU.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "description": "The government has published a report setting out the risks of a no-deal Brexit.
