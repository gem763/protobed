I would say at this moment in time he has better delivery but Kieran is a better defensive player,\u201d the former Celtic and Wales forward told the Daily Record .\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u201cKieran gets low and defends well and he can also play as wing-back if needed. I watched Robertson when he was playing for Dundee United when I was covering the game and he was good.\n\n\u201cHe went down to Hull and his career fizzled out there but Liverpool took him for \u00a310milion and now he is on fire.\u201d\n\nHartson went on to say that Tierney was an excellent piece of business for the Gunners considering the prices of other players who moved this summer.\n\n\" Arsenal probably got him on the cheap if you look at the fact Manchester United paid \u00a350million for Aaron Wan-Bissaka,\" he continued.\n\n(Image: X03806)\n\n\u201cAlso, average players are going for \u00a330million or \u00a340million and Kieran is certainly not average.\n\n\u201cCeltic could have held out for another \u00a35million or so but it is still good money they have banked, especially due to the fact he has come through the ranks and hasn\u2019t cost the club a penny.\n\n\u201cHe is worth \u00a325million and he can excel in a different league because there\u2019s a perception the Scottish league is just not as good.\u201d", "description": "The Scottish pair are now Premier League rivals following Tierney's \u00a325million move from Celtic to Arsenal in the summer", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20401025.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Europa-League-Group-F-Arsenal-v-Standard-Liege.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
