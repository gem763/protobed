(Jamie Mitchell/The Southwest Times Record/AP)\n\nTime was running out for Debra Stevens. But the 911 dispatcher didn\u2019t seem concerned.\n\n\u201cSomebody save me!\u201d Stevens screamed as the water level crept up inside her car, which was stranded in floodwater.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re freaking out,\u201d the dispatcher, Donna Reneau, responded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to die,\u201d Stevens cried later.\n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Reneau said.\n\nStevens did die, but only after the dispatcher told the Fort Smith, Ark., woman to \u201cshut up,\u201d chastised her for worrying that the phone call would cut off and berated her for driving into water \u2014 water the frantic flood victim swore she had not seen.\n\n\u201cWell, this will teach you,\u201d Reneau can be heard saying in audio of the call released this week by Fort Smith police.\n\nThe recording has intensified outrage over the operator\u2019s response that authorities admitted \u201csounds calloused and uncaring\u201d even as they insist \u201csincere efforts were being made\u201d to save Stevens, 47, from drowning. Police have launched an internal investigation but said that Reneau \u2014 who submitted her resignation earlier in August and was on her last shift when Stevens\u2019s call came in, according to the Southwest Times Record \u2014 will probably not face formal repercussions for the way she treated Stevens in the woman\u2019s last minutes alive.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d Stevens says over and over, as her voice becomes increasingly garbled and high-pitched toward the end of her call.\n\n\u201cShe is legit freaking out,\u201d Reneau tells other responders after about 20 seconds of the screams.\n\nFort Smith police said no one was around on Saturday who could answer The Washington Post\u2019s questions, and The Post was unable to reach Reneau.\n\nStevens\u2019s SUV was swept off the road and into trees by flash flooding last Saturday as she delivered papers for the Times Record, police said. She used her cellphone to call a family member first, then dialed 911 from her vehicle at 4:38 a.m., as the water rose.\n\nStevens was on the phone with Reneau for approximately 22 minutes as the water level climbed from Stevens\u2019s feet to her head. She told the dispatcher she could not swim.\n\nCity fire and police staff were \u201cinundated with 911 calls from other citizens also stranded in flood waters,\u201d police said in a statement. Stevens couldn\u2019t describe her exact location. And flooding made a quick rescue \u201cimpossible\u201d when first responders figured out where she was, police said.\n\nAn officer wearing a life vest was prepared to wade into the current tied to a rope, \u201cbut the speed and volume of water made this attempt futile,\u201d the police department said. By the time authorities reached Stevens and began CPR \u2014 about 80 minutes after she first called in terror and nearly an hour after responders located her car \u2014 she had drowned.\n\n\u201cAll of our first responders who attempted to save Mrs. Stevens are distraught over the outcome,\u201d interim police chief Danny Baker said in a statement. \u201cFor every one of us, saving lives is at the very core of who we are and why we do what we do.\u201d\n\nReneau\u2019s handling of the dying woman\u2019s call led to criticism and mistrust from the public.\n\n\u201cAfter hearing one of your dispatchers this morning \u2026 I\u2019m sick to my stomach,\u201d one man posted on a Facebook event for an upcoming Fort Smith \u201cCoffee with the Cops and 911 Dispatchers.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call 911 in Fort Smith,\u201d another person commented under a police post promoting a Red Cross number for help with floodwaters. \u201cThey will let you die and tell you to \u2018shut up,\u2019 while you beg for help.\u201d\n\nReneau joined the police\u2019s Communications Center in 2013 and went on to train new hires, according to a police department post spotlighting the staffer last year as an \u201cessential member of the unit with experience and knowledge.\u201d In February, the Fort Smith Police Department congratulated her on being chosen \u201cFire Dispatcher of the Year.\u201d A police captain has called Reneau\u2019s attitude while talking to Stevens \u201cuncharacteristic.\u201d\n\nBaker said the police department would have disciplined Reneau if she were still on the force, the Times Record reported. But he said he did not believe the phone call warranted firing or a criminal investigation.\n\nHe did say, however, that Reneau may have failed to convey the urgency of Stevens\u2019s call to first responders, contributing to the woman\u2019s death.\n\nExperts say people caught in a car amid flooding should stay inside the vehicle. If the water is rising, the Federal Emergency Management Agency suggests trying to climb out through the window and onto the roof of the car. In the audio released, Reneau does not make that suggestion to Stevens.\n\nThe internal police investigation will focus on policy changes that could prevent what happened to Stevens from recurring, Baker said, according to the Times Record. City authorities are reexamining their training for dispatchers.\n\nBaker added that police staffing is an \u201ceveryday concern\u201d for his department. Four dispatchers were overseeing seven 911 lines when Stevens called, while nine officers were patrolling the city, as is typical for the past couple of years.\n\nStevens was apologetic at times on the line with Reneau before her death.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t see it, ma\u2019am, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said after the dispatcher admonished her not to \u201cdrive into water\u201d next time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how you didn\u2019t see it,\u201d Reneau said. \u201cYou had to go right over it, so \u2026\u201d\n\nAudio captures Stevens\u2019s growing fear as she says the water rose to her neck \u2014 and Reneau\u2019s direction not long after to \u201cshut up\u201d and listen. Approximately 22 minutes into the call, Stevens\u2019s voice seems to come from underwater.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want us interacting with anyone in that way, whether it\u2019s a life or death situation or not,\u201d Baker said, according to the Times Record.\n\nBut police Capt. Wes Milam also emphasized the difficulties of a dispatcher\u2019s job, the Times Record reported.\n\n\u201cWhen they call like that, they have to ascertain a lot of information, and when they get all this information, they have to bring the emotionality out of it to increase rationality,\u201d Milam said, according to the newspaper.\n\nAngela Fritz contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nBret Stephens is still talking about bedbugs \u2014 and now, the language of the Holocaust\n\nCaretakers were \u2018willfully torturing\u2019 a mentally disabled woman, police say.
