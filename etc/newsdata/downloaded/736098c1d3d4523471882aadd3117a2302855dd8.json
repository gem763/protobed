Photo: Steven Ferdman/Getty Images\n\nShep Smith, a mostly straight-news broadcaster who stood in stark contrast to many of his aggressively partisan Fox News colleagues, announced on Friday that he would be departing the network immediately. \u201cRecently I asked the company to allow me to leave Fox News and begin a new chapter,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAfter requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged.\u201d Smith closed with a reflection on how grateful he was to have been at the network \u2014 and a seemingly pointed plea: \u201cEven in our currently polarized nation, it\u2019s my hope that the facts will win the day, that the truth will always matter, that journalism and journalists will survive.\u201d\n\nFull video: Shepard Smith's final sign off from Fox News pic.twitter.com/5fgyM81Gbj \u2014 Jon Passantino (@passantino) October 11, 2019\n\nSmith, who had been at Fox News since it launched in 1996, has been at the center of a widening chasm at the network centered around President Trump. Some on the news side of the operation \u2014 Smith, Andrew Napolitano, and Chris Wallace \u2014 have been increasingly outspoken about the president\u2019s misconduct and worsening political troubles, while heavy hitters on the opinion side \u2014 Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and others \u2014 have remained unshakably loyal to the president, eagerly promoting the kind of conspiracy theories that he uses to defend himself.\n\nIn recent days, President Trump has sounded off about negative coverage on the network, including polls that showed him losing to Democratic opponents. On Thursday, not for the first time, Trump singled out Smith by name. After hearing of his departure, Trump displayed his usual magnanimity.\n\nPresident Trump said he wishes Shepard Smith, the chief news anchor of Fox News, well on his departure from the network. He said multiple times: Is he leaving because of low ratings? I would assume he\u2019s leaving because of low ratings. \u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) October 11, 2019\n\nThe New York Times reported that Attorney General William Barr met with Fox News CEO Rupert Murdoch on Wednesday night, fueling speculation that the Trump administration was working within the network to neuter criticism. Smith\u2019s spokesperson attempted to put the idea to rest:\n\nNEW: The Barr-Murdoch meeting was *not* related to Shep Smith's exit, Chris Giglio, a spokesman for Shep, tells me via email. \"This was Shep's decision and his alone.\" \u2014 Michael M. Grynbaum (@grynbaum) October 11, 2019\n\nBut given Fox\u2019s strict nondisclosure agreements, it\u2019s unlikely that Smith will be divulging much about the circumstances that led to his departure. It\u2019s also unlikely that he\u2019ll be showing up on another network anytime soon: He said an agreement he signed with Fox News means that he \u201cwon\u2019t be reporting elsewhere at least in the near future.\u201d", "description": "After 23 years at Fox News, Shep Smith suddenly announced his departure on Friday afternoon, amid tensions at the network over its posture toward President Trump.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hart"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/11/11-shep-smith.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
