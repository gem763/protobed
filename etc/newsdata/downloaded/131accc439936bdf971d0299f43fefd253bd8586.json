You don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the ex-mayor said. \u201cI\u2019m weighing the alternatives. I\u2019ll get all my evidence together, I\u2019ll get my charts.\u201d\n\nGiuliani then indicated he could be swayed if Congress wanted to review video and audio recordings he had gathered over the course of his Ukrainian adventures. Some Democrats, meanwhile, have expressed hesitation about inviting a wild card such as Giuliani for a public hearing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, if they let me use videotapes and tape recordings that I have, if they let me get some of the evidence that I gathered,\u201d he declared before trailing off, adding: \u201cAnd I have to tell you, Sean, all this nonsense about I was interfering in the election, I gathered all this evidence before the Mueller probe ended, so it was clearly under my responsibility as the lawyer for the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nWhile Giuliani told Hannity his evidence-gathering took place while he was working as the president\u2019s attorney in relation to the Muller investigation, he has repeatedly insisted that the State Department called and asked him to look into Ukraine.\n\nInterestingly, even though Hannity\u2019s network broke the story, the host didn\u2019t ask Giuliani about Fox News anchor Chris Wallace\u2019s report that Giuliani enlisted Trump-supporting lawyers\u2014and frequent Hannity guests\u2014Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing to work \u201coff the books\u201d for Trump to gather opposition research on Biden in Ukraine. Wallace also reported Trump was the only one in government aware of the plan.", "description": "\u201cI don\u2019t know, if they let me use videotapes and tape recordings that I have, if they let me get some of the evidence that I gathered,\u201d Giuliani declared.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569898947/hannity_80_zd9lmf", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
