Researchers believe that changes to the Earth's orbit may be partly responsible for some of the Earth's cooling, but additional factors have likely played a part, Jensen added.\n\n\u201cThe most plausible explanation is that there was some change in how carbon was divided between the atmosphere and the ocean,\u201d Jansen continued. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of ideas about how this happens, but it\u2019s not quite clear how they all fit together.\u201d\n\nResearchers also believe a mini-ice age may have occurred roughly 12,800 years ago. It likely stems from an asteroid impact that \"rocked the Northern Hemisphere\" and led to the Younger Dryas climate event.\n\nJansen pointed out that the Southern Ocean around Antarctica \"plays a key role in ocean circulation\" due to the deep waters in the region, leading it to have \"outsize[d] consequences.\"\n\nAIR POLLUTION MORE DEADLY THAN SMOKING, NEW STUDY FINDS\n\n\u201cWhat this suggests is that it\u2019s a feedback loop,\u201d said the study's lead author, Alice Marzocchi. \u201cAs the temperature drops, less carbon is released into the atmosphere, which triggers more cooling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat surprised me is how much of this increased storage can be attributed to physical changes alone, with Antarctic sea-ice cover being the key player,\u201d Marzocchi added, noting that future study of the ocean and the role it plays in the carbon cycle can help simulate \"future environmental change.\u201d\n\nThe research has been published in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Upside-down \"rivers\" of warm ocean water may be one of the causes of Antarctica's ice shelves breaking up, leading to a rise in sea levels.
