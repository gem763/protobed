Mark Warner Mark Robert WarnerSenate Dems slam Trump for shifting funds meant to deter Russia to border wall Senate GOP blocks three election security bills for second day Hillicon Valley: Zuckerberg would support delaying Libra | More attorneys general join Facebook probe | Defense chief recuses from 'war cloud' contract | Senate GOP blocks two election security bills | FTC brings case against 'stalking' app developer MORE (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former technology executive, told The Hill on Tuesday that he was \u201cpleased to see the FCC address the threat to network security posed by vendors such as Huawei and ZTE,\u201d calling it a \u201ccritical first step.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut Warner also said Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai should have acted sooner and he \"urged\" the Trump administration to \u201cwork with Congress to pass legislation to help rural carriers remove legacy equipment and to harden the U.S. telecommunications supply chain.\"\n\n\"There is a lot of work left to be done,\u201d Warner added.\n\nThe proposed rules, rolled out by Pai on Monday, would bar U.S. telecom groups from using funds from the FCC\u2019s Universal Services Fund (USF) to buy equipment from companies deemed national security threats, and would designate Huawei and ZTE as such.\n\nA second proposal would require U.S. telecom companies that currently use Huawei and ZTE products to rip out and replace that equipment and could establish a \u201creimbursement program\u201d to help rural companies that rely heavily on Chinese equipment.\n\nThe proposal comes as the U.S. crackdown on Huawei and ZTE reaches a critical point.\n\nThe FCC is slated to vote on the proposals on Nov. 19, the same day that Huawei is set to be formally added to the Commerce Department\u2019s \u201centity list,\u201d which bans American companies from doing business with it. Huawei was added to the list in May, but the rule was delayed as the Commerce Department gave U.S. companies more time to comply.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community has warned of national security concerns over the companies, while Huawei officials deny they pose any threat.\n\nCracking down on the companies has rare bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers broadly supportive of moves to prevent American companies from using the Chinese firms' products.\n\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Greg Walden Gregory (Greg) Paul WaldenShimkus says he's been asked to reconsider retirement Walden retirement adds to GOP election woes Overnight Energy: Automakers group sides with Trump in emissions lawsuit | Latest on California wildfires | Walden won't seek reelection | Park Service scraps plan to charge protesters for security MORE (R-Ore.) told The Hill on Tuesday that he would \u201cwant to look at\u201d the proposals before commenting on them, but that he was \u201cprobably supportive of them.\"\n\nCommittee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), however, told The Hill that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t talk\u201d about the FCC's plans.\n\nThe two lawmakers, though, have been broadly supportive of efforts to help U.S. companies replace Huawei equipment, in particular rural telecom companies. Pallone and Walden, who is retiring after this term, proposed the Secure and Trusted Telecommunications Network Act last month.\n\nIt would prohibit the use of federal funding to purchase telecom equipment from companies deemed national security threats and allocate $1 billion to help U.S. telecom companies replace equipment deemed a threat. But the bill has not seen action in Congress.\n\nAcross the Capitol, senators also offered cautious optimism about the FCC plans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I am very interested in, but that I don\u2019t have a reaction to right now,\" Sen. Gary Peters Gary Charles PetersSynagogues ramp up security in year since Tree of Life shooting Hillicon Valley: Facebook launches 'News Tab' | Senate passes bill to take on 'deepfakes' | Schumer outlines vision for electric cars Senate passes legislation to combat 'deepfake' videos MORE (D-Mich.), the top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, told The Hill.\n\n\u201cI think that it is appropriate to look at Huawei and what their participation is,\u201d said Sen. Marsha Blackburn Marsha BlackburnGOP senator defends Facebook over political ad policy Sen. Marsha Blackburn laughs off Zuckerberg speech The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - ISIS leader dead; Congresswoman resigns MORE (R-Tenn.), who has previously accused China of building a \u201cspy network\u201d through the use of Huawei technologies.\n\nIndustry groups also expressed early praise for the FCC effort.\n\nRobert Mayer, the senior vice president of cybersecurity at USTelecom, whose members include telecom giants such as AT&T and Verizon, was positive about the proposals, calling them \"timely and prudent.\"\n\n\u201cThe FCC\u2019s call for a fact-based review on \u2018rip and replace\u2019 for existing equipment will also help inform a global discussion about risk tolerance, especially when it comes to national security considerations,\u201d Mayer added.\n\nClaude Aiken, the president and CEO of the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association (WISPA), said in a statement that the FCC proposals could give \u201cclarity\u201d to telecom providers who are trying to \u201cdeploy secure and cost-effective equipment.\u201d\n\nAiken said the proposals mean that \u201cproviders who have used now-prohibited equipment will be given the time and resources to make an appropriate transition.\u201d\n\nBut there are still many questions over the proposals, including how any rip and replace program would work. And there is also the question of pushback from China, which has sharply criticized efforts to target Huawei and ZTE.\n\nSome industry groups were more cautious in their response, in particular those representing rural telecoms. Those companies are expected to be the hardest hit by any ban on Huawei and ZTE due to their widespread use of their equipment.\n\nMike Romano, senior vice president of Industry Affairs and Business Development at NCTA- The Rural Broadband Association, which represents over 800 community-based, independent rural telecom companies, told The Hill his organization \u201cneeds to review how the FCC\u2019s proposals work.\"\n\nBut Romano added it was \"helpful\" to see attention paid to addressing \"the ultimate costs of removal and replacement.\u201d", "description": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is moving aggressively to ban companies from using federal subsidies for equipment from Chinese telecommunications groups Huawei and ZTE, and earning initial praise from lawmakers and industry groups.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/huawei_052719getty_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
