It gives the players confidence and momentum.\n\n\u201cWe have missed Anthony, he is a very important player for us, the way we play and today Marcus Rashford was excellent down the sides and in the middle.\n\n\u201cA great response to missing the penalty, chasing back and scoring.\n\n\u201cThe third was a very good goal and a class finish.\n\n\u201cIt is great for Martial to score a goal like that. We could and should have had a few more goals.\u201d", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s relief at Manchester United securing their first Premier League away win in eight months over struggling", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/b76940_manchester-united-poor-results-season-has-hurt-manager-ole-gunnar-solskjaer-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
