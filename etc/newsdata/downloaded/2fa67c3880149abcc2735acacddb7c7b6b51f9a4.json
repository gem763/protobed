Emmys organisers apologised for the error.\n\nSlatkin said he was \"shocked that in giving their best to Andre Previn, they wound up giving their worst to me\".\n\nSpeaking to TV show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, he joked: \"They talk about people spinning in their graves - Andre's not spinning, he's laughing all the way.\"\n\nSlatkin, who is music director laureate of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, added: \"I knew him very well\u2026 Andre, he did it all, he was a great gentleman and I was just so sad that he couldn't be remembered as he should be.\"\n\nSlatkin, who is currently in Ireland, said: \"I woke up at about 4am and I got up to follow the baseball scores, turned on the computer, and saw... I knew Andre had gone a few months ago, apparently me too!\n\n\"There were a flood of messages that had come in and I kept wondering, 'Why are people sending me messages if they think I've gone?'\"\n\nIn a statement given to The New York Times, organisers said: \"The producers for the 71st Emmy Awards, the Television Academy and Fox sincerely apologise for this error. All In Memoriam mentions on the Television Academy's website feature accurate imagery for Mr Previn.\"\n\nDuring his show on Monday, Kimmel also made reference to the drop in ratings for the Emmys ceremony.\n\nIt was watched by 6.9 million US viewers on Sunday, broadcaster Fox said, down from the 10.2 million who tuned in last year.\n\nViewers watching the Emmys have halved since 2014. \"If things get any worse, they may have to add themselves into the in memoriam reel,\" Kimmel joked.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
