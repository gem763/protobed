A \u201clong duration of low humidity and dry vegetation will make this a very critical event!\u201d the Weather Service said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe dire weather warnings came just days after Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) declared a statewide emergency over wildfires \u2014 and amid an unprecedented wave of blackouts ordered by Pacific Gas & Electric, which has shut power to millions of customers in an effort to curb fire risk.\n\nThe state\u2019s largest utility has told regulators that a jumper on one of its transmission towers broke close to where the Kincade Fire started, near Geyserville. The cause of the fire, which has been burning since Wednesday, is under investigation.\n\nFire officials said Monday that they had contained only 15 percent of the blaze, which now covers nearly 75,000 acres \u2014 an area more than twice the size of San Francisco \u2014 and is California\u2019s biggest fire of the year. Officials said they expected the Kincade Fire, which is moving steadily toward the city of Santa Rosa, to burn until at least Nov. 7.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFirefighters got a brief reprieve Monday when gusts died down, but they struggled to keep pace with the expanding blaze as winds changed direction, officials said. Even as officials lifted mandatory evacuation orders for parts of the county along the Pacific coast, they issued new evacuation warnings for a part of Lake County as the flames threatened to lurch eastward.\n\nAt least 123 structures have been destroyed in the fire, but only one injury has been reported \u2014 and there have been no deaths attributed to the blaze, which is burning in the same region where 22 people were killed in the Tubbs Fire in 2017. Evacuations have largely gone smoothly as the nation\u2019s most populous state adapts to increasing wildfires that many officials link to climate change.\n\nEmergency responders on the other end of the state are trying to beat back a fast-moving brush fire that has consumed about 618 acres on the western edge of Los Angeles and forced the evacuation of more than 10,000 homes and businesses. Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) said Monday evening that the Getty Fire was five percent contained and had not grown since midday. At least eight homes have been destroyed in the blaze, and six others have been damaged, officials said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Getty and Kincade fires have been sparked by hurricane-like winds that for three years have caused fiery infernos to break out across the Golden State, which is coming to accept the blazes as the new normal. The gusts are known as \u201cDiablo winds\u201d in the San Francisco Bay area and \u201cSanta Ana winds\u201d in Southern California.\n\nRed Flag warnings are up for the San Francisco Bay area and much of North-Central California. The most volatile conditions in the vicinity of the Kincade Fire are forecast to occur from Tuesday through Wednesday afternoon, when winds in higher elevations may reach up to 65 mph.\n\nOffshore winds are also anticipated for lower elevations, which will lead to extremely dry air that is conducive for rapidly spreading wildfires. The ongoing offshore wind event, which is powered by the difference in air pressure between the Great Basin region and coastal California, is not anticipated to bring winds as high as the event over the weekend when the blaze began.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNorthern California faced a blast of wind Wednesday and Thursday, and again over the weekend, when it was whipped with hurricane-force gusts. The coming surge this week, on Tuesday and Wednesday, is expected to be the third windstorm in quick succession.\n\nThe repeated high wind events are resulting in dry vegetation that will burn easily if any new fires ignite. In fact, forecasters in San Francisco said they have never before seen three Red Flag warning events in a seven-day period.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business for 28 years; I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Steve Anderson, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service\u2019s forecast office serving the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nAD\n\nResidents of Southern California, particularly from Los Angeles and Ventura counties south to San Diego, are gearing up for what could be a record-setting Santa Ana wind event beginning around midnight Tuesday night and continuing through Thursday. A Red Flag Warning has been hoisted for the metro L.A. area, where winds could gust as high as 80 mph in higher elevations and canyons and reach 70 mph in valley locations.\n\nAD\n\nIn an ominous sign, the National Weather Service said early Tuesday that the upcoming event promises to be a \u201chigh end dangerous event.\u201d One indicator of this is that the forecast air pressure gradient, which controls how strong the winds will be, is forecast to be at record-high levels for late October and early November. In general, the greater the pressure gradient, the stronger the winds, since air flows from high to low pressure.\n\nGiven that there have been many Santa Ana wind events during this period, a record-setting event would be particularly dangerous and could cause significant damage of in the form of downed trees and power lines and minor structural damage, according to the NWS. Any fires that occur during this period could be nearly impossible to control.\n\nKim Bellware, Kayla Epstein, Derek Hawkins, Hannah Knowles and Jason Samenow contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The Kincade Fire, which is threatening Sonoma County's population hub of Santa Rosa, has forced nearly 200,000 people to evacuate Northern California's wine country.", "authors": ["Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3elgWO9YstbaHsRqXz9ZLe9SpzA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VOCGT2HZXMI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
