Photo: Courtesy Retailers\n\nIn fielding all the reader questions for our resident Cool Guy Chris Black week after week, we\u2019ve noticed that a lot of folks continue to ask for his sage advice about basic but essential clothes (and other products) that will do the job while still flexing your sense of style. So instead of asking him to repeat himself, we combed his columns to date to compile this Chris-approved list of 25 basics he swears by, from white T-shirts to jeans to deodorant to socks to backpack (which, spoiler alert, is not a backpack). Read on for all of the basics that, according to him, will make you appear anything but.\n\nWhite T-shirt\n\nThick-neck white T-shirt\n\nPro Club Men\u2019s Comfort Cotton Short Sleeve T-Shirt A \u201cTHICC neck,\u201d as Chris likes to call it, gives a white tee a bit of a sturdier, more put-together look. As for how to wear white tees, he says, \u201cthey look good under a hooded sweatshirt, a cardigan, or even a suit.\u201d From $10 at Amazon Buy $9 at Walmart Buy\n\nLong-sleeve T-shirt\n\nBackpack\n\nBlack jeans\n\nNon-denim pants\n\nSocks\n\nDeodorant\n\nButton-down shirt\n\nUniqlo Men Oxford Slim-Fit Long-Sleeve Shirt The Oxford button-down shirt is another \u201cwardrobe staple,\u201d according to Chris, who told us he\u2019s a longtime fan of Uniqlo\u2019s, \u201cwhich can\u2019t be beat for the price.\u201d In addition to white, it comes in other colors like light blue, black, and navy. $30 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nFancier button-down shirt\n\nBrooks Brothers Regent Fit Oxford Sport Shirt \u201cIf you want to go a step up from Uniqlo, you cannot go wrong with Brooks Brothers,\u201d writes Chris. He goes for the brand\u2019s Regent fit, which is \u201cheavy-duty and cut a little slimmer.\u201d $140 at Brooks Brothers Buy\n\nSuit\n\nWhen it comes to a basic suit, Chris again says that budget-friendly Uniqlo\u2019s comfortable blazer and pants can\u2019t be beat. \u201cThe ultralight Kando pants in navy are quite breathable and functional and look nice, too. The matching Kando blazer will dress the outfit up,\u201d writes Chris, who notes that the jacket is equally lightweight, \u201cso you won\u2019t show up drenched in sweat.\u201d\n\nMoisturizer\n\nAesop Perfect Facial Hydrating Cream Although he keeps three moisturizers in his bathroom at all times, Chris says this is the one he uses every day. \u201cIt is perfect for daily use after cleansing and toning,\u201d he says. $120 at Barneys New York Buy\n\nBirkenstocks\n\nBirkenstock Boston Suede Chris has been wearing Bostons ever since he got a free pair while \u201cworking at an Atlanta footwear institution called Abbadabba\u2019s,\u201d way back when he was \u201c19, smoking Parliament Lights, and living in a house with four dudes.\u201d Of his preferred style, he says: \u201cThey are comfortable and sort of ugly, in the best way possible.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: Amazon has one pair of these in size 16 for $69; smaller sizes start at $110.] From $64 at Amazon Buy $135 at Zappos Buy\n\nGym shirt\n\nGym shorts\n\nNike Flex Stride 5\u201d Running Short Chris notes that his favorite workout shorts \u2014 and shirt \u2014 are made from \u201cbasic sweat-wicking materials.\u201d $45 at Zappos Buy\n\niPhone case\n\nPeel Super Thin iPhone Xs Case \u201cThe iPhone, as an object, is beautiful and sleek, but when you add a bulky and unsightly case, it ruins the integrity of the design,\u201d says Chris. That\u2019s why Peel\u2019s case \u2014 which is \u201cso minimal that people don\u2019t notice it but does the job well\u201d \u2014 is the only one he says he can possibly recommend. $29 at Peel Buy\n\nWhite sneakers\n\nNonwhite sneakers\n\nDress shoe\n\nHair product\n\nSachajuan Ocean Mist Normally a shampoo-and-conditioner-only type of guy, Chris told us his barber not long ago turned him on to salt spray, and that he \u201cloves the effect it has\u201d on his hair. After shopping around, he started using this. \u201cTBH, it doesn\u2019t smell great, but the spray adds some volume and texture.\u201d $31 at Amazon Buy $31 at Dermstore Buy\n\nRain jacket\n\nBaseball hat\n\nSunglasses\n\nMoscot Lemtosh Sun \u201cAs a prescription-glasses wearer,\u201d Chris writes, \u201cmy desire to switch out eyewear like my hero Elton John is limited by my poor vision and budget.\u201d His go-to pair of sunglasses is a classic style from 104-year-old maker Moscot. They\u2019re not cheap, but they are timeless, so you won\u2019t need to switch them out like other, trendier shades. $300 at Moscot Buy\n\nDopp kit\n\nFilson Weatherproof Leather Travel Kit For a simple Dopp kit, \u201cyou can\u2019t go wrong with brown leather from Filson,\u201d according to Chris. \u201cThe branding is understated, and the Dopp kit will age beautifully.\u201d $250 at Zappos Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
