And rivers over thousands of years meander,' Mr Coughlan told The Courier Mail.\n\n'I think we were expecting poor soils but we hit the jackpot, which as an engineer you don't want to hit, which is the worst you could have.'\n\nHe said the engineers are building up the site in terms of height and also weighing it down to compress the topsoil.\n\nThe second runway has been one of the biggest engineering challenges in the world due to its location.\n\nMore than 11 million cubic metres of sand was pumped out of Moreton Bay and on to the new runway site.\n\nThe sand was left to settle for three years - slowly weighing down the soil so that the water was squeezed to the top and pumped away.\n\nSite works at the new Brisbane Airport runway have shifted millions of cubic metres of topsoil\n\nOver time the ground sunk as much as three metres in some areas.\n\nAfter this time construction on the actual runway itself then began in 2017 - with 2 million cubic metres of sand scraped from the top of the site - having done its job.\n\nThe runway is expected to open in mid 2020 with construction being completed later this year.\n\nBRISBANE AIRPORT'S SECOND RUNWAY The largest aviation construction project in Australia. Work began in 2012 and will be completed in 2020. Engineers now think the Brisbane River use to run under the site. Millions of cubic metres of sand was pumped onto the site. The sand weighed down the soil and squeezed water to the top. The total project cost is $1.3 billion. The construction site is more than three times the size of the Brisbane CBD. The runway is 3.3km long and has 12km of taxiways. Passenger numbers are expected to eventually double.", "description": "An incredible discovery underneath Brisbane's new $1.3 billion second runway has left engineers shocked.", "authors": ["Brett Lackey For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/01/20014238-0-image-a-5_1571705227913.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
