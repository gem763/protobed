That is the most expensive beer in history.\" Lalor tweeted alongside a photo after realizing how much he'd been charged. \"I paid $99,983.64 for it in the Malmaison Hotel, Manchester the other night. Seriously.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I didn't have my reading glasses when [the barmaid] presented me with a bill for the beer and when she had some problems with the machine I didn't think much of it, but it was eventually resolved, I said I didn't want a receipt and she went to leave.\n\n\"Something, however, made me ask 'how much did I just pay for that beer'.
