It would be in the interest of the government that production of coal in Colombia does not fall.\n\n''Perhaps the country is willing to consider a different tax and royalty regime for production that is going to the Pacific, and that way we would be able to promote the companies seeking to establish themselves in the Pacific market.", "description": "The Colombian coal mine owned by BHP, Glencore and Anglo American wants a lower tax take to allow it to compete with Australian miners in Asian markets.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_66/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/936bf1cf08be31d196b71ee2e8b86be78bdbadca", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
