But in an interview with \"TODAY,\" the authors insist that while they wanted to amplify his accusers' voices, they also wanted to tell his side of the story.\n\nThe authors spent 10 months researching the claims of his accusers, specifically that of Deborah Ramirez, who claims that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a college party. That accusation, along with that of Christine Blasey Ford's, may have been awarded complete credence by the media, but Pogrebin and Kelly note that they found the reality to be considerably more \"nuanced.\"\n\n\"People assumed we\u2019d have knee jerk sympathy for the women who came forward, and we certainly do,\" the authors told NBC reporter Stephanie Gosk in a recent sit down interview. \"But we also had to put ourselves in his shoes. Imagine if you\u2019ve been falsely accused of something that you didn\u2019t do or at least have no memory of doing, and you see your life upended and your family accused and his wife received death threats too.\"\n\nTheir research convinced them that both Ford\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s accusations have \"real credence.\" But, they added a caveat: In the past 36 years Brett Kavanaugh has been a \"better man.\"\n\nGosk too noted that Kavanaugh has \"walked the walk\" as an adult.\n\n\"He\u2019s lived an exemplary life as an adult,\" she noted.\n\nThe authors admitted that Kavanaugh's commitment to mentoring young lawyers, specifically his young female clerks, is \"real.\"\n\nThe TODAY anchors note that the book is not likely to change minds on either side of the debate, but Gosk suggests it may encourage people to \"open their minds.\"", "description": ".09/16/2019 19:08:15PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/296/2ff9ba7e-5de4-4ec2-b7f7-99acf6421967.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
