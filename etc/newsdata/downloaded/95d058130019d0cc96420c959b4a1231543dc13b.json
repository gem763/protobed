I just always had a fascination with cats and I felt myself, I'm a cat.\n\n\u201cI go through life being a cat \u2013 it's just who I am.\u201d\n\nKat claims she realised she was a cat when she was a teenager and has identified as a feline since she was in high school.\n\n(Image: Mike Shum / Barcroft Media)\n\nShe said: \u201cI've always worn cat ears.\n\n\u201cIt started when I was in high school, I don't remember exactly what age I was but it [came from] an anime.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, that's cool. I want to be that in real life'. So I just started applying that to my real life.\n\n\u201cI don't think I started the ears, tail, the collar and all that stuff until later on in life. I was bullied a lot for wearing the ears and just being a nerd.\n\n\u201cSo I kind of kept it a little bit hidden.\u201d\n\nKat decided to embrace her kitten identity when she came across the Cat Girl Manor kittens and eventually discovered others who identified as cats.\n\n(Image: Mike Shum / Barcroft Media)\n\nShe said: \u201cI just saw other girls doing it, so I felt more comfortable doing it myself.\u201d\n\nKat opened up to Rob about her life as a cat at the very beginning of their relationship.\n\nHe said: \u201cEveryone has something different that they do.\n\n\u201cI see it as another outlet for a person to enjoy, relax, be themselves and be creative.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of their sexual life as a couple, Rob added: \u201cWe experiment quite a bit on the sexual side.\n\n\u201cIt's one of the things that possible experimentation areas. Pet play was something new to me that Kat introduced me to.\n\n(Image: Mike Shum / Barcroft Media)\n\n\u201cI was willing to be experimental and try new things. The master side of it, not as comfortable with but willing to do that a little bit too.\u201d\n\nIn their relationship, Kat mostly takes a submissive role and considers Rob as her \u201cmaster\".\n\nBut she stresses she gets a lot of pleasure from it.\n\nShe said: \u201cI like wearing the collar every day \u2013 a collar to represent just him being owned by him.\u201d\n\nRob added: \u201cWe do have the freedom to be fun and not worry about things so much. We do unusual things, not the norm things, we like to have fun.\n\n\u201cI think people should be unashamed and unafraid to explore what they want to explore.\u201d\n\n(Image: Mike Shum / Barcroft Media)\n\nBut Kat admitted that not everyone has been supportive of her kitten play.\n\nShe said: \u201cMy family and certain people are not accepting, they don't want to know anything about it.\n\n\u201cIt's hard but I'm going to be who I am no matter if people are going to be accepting of this lifestyle or not.\n\n\u201cI'm just going to be who I am.\u201d\n\nKat, who loves wearing furry ears and an artificial tail, said that for her pet play is not only sexual, but it\u2019s also her lifestyle.\n\nShe explaiend: \u201cWhen I first got into pet play, I just felt a sense of home. I've always felt like I was a cat.\n\n\u201cWhen I'm in my kitten mode I'm happy. It's my space.\n\n\u201cGrowing up I had to pretend to be normal and not be the cat person but now I get to be myself, I get to express myself, I get to climb, if I want to climb, I can if I want to drink out of a bowl, I can if I want to wear a collar, if I want to wear my ears, I can do it.\n\n\u201cI don't have anybody stopping me saying: \u2018Okay, well, you need to be normal\u2019. Now I can just be myself.\u201d", "description": "Kat Lyons says she has felt like a cat since she was a teenager and now wears a collar and cat ears every day", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Mike Shum", "Barcroft Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20756649.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_My-Girlfriend-Identifies-As-A-Cat.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
