And that\u2019s a sentence that somehow suggests the news is now being written by an algorithm designed to generate random shittiness,\u201d joked Oliver.\n\n\u201cAnd if that wasn\u2019t sufficiently stupid, the very next day, during Trump\u2019s customary screaming-next-to-a-helicopter time, he decided to answer a question on what he wanted Ukraine to do like this,\u201d the comic continued, cutting to a clip of Trump proclaiming, \u201c[Ukraine] should start an investigation into the Bidens. Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoly shit! So instead of denying that he privately solicited dirt from a foreign power he publicly did it, and then asked another foreign power to get involved too, which is just making it worse,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt is bad enough that Trump seems fixated on a right-wing conspiracy theory about the Bidens, but what makes it far worse is the extent to which he has abused the power of the presidency to pursue that belief.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the president. He has real power, and when he abuses it to keep himself in power, that\u2019s a big problem,\u201d Oliver concluded. \u201cThis is a case where, when the president does it, it has to be illegal\u2014and for good reason, because unfortunately, not every foreign government will be as brave and willing to stand up to Trump as fucking Nickelback.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, streams and sales of Nickelback\u2019s \u201cPhotograph\u201d have soared in the wake of their takedown stand.", "description": "The \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d host applauded the Canadian rock band for hitting Trump with a copyright violation claim on Twitter after he used their hit song \u201cPhotograph.\u201d", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_719,w_1277,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570428557/Screen_Shot_2019-10-07_at_2.08.26_AM_rfxiai", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
