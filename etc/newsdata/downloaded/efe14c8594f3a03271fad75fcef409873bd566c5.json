Stay healthy. Compete like heck and, as Golden Tate suggested, give themselves a chance to \"shock the world.\" In reality, this is not just a step up in class as the Vikings represented - this is a mammoth leap. The onus will be on Pat Shurmur and his coaches to make sure no one in the locker room gets discouraged coming out of this one. There will be plenty of games left to play, and we can't lose sight of the fact that, for many of the players on the roster, this is a developmental season to build for the future.\n\nPatriots: The Patriots are out of the gates about as well as they can be. They haven't necessarily faced five heavyweights - Buffalo is the only one with a winning record - but the machine roles on.\n\nKey matchup\n\nGiants QB Daniel Jones vs. Patriots S Devin McCourty: Jones has faced very good to great defensive fronts in his three starts, but the difference against Minnesota was the presence of safety Harrison Smith, whose athleticism brought a rare element on the back end. Same can be said for McCourty, the former St. Joseph and Rutgers star whose versatility will challenge Jones. Bill Belichick is 11-0 against rookie quarterbacks at home in his coaching career with the Patriots. What the Giants will want to see from Jones is his composure, obviously, but also his ability to match wits with McCourty, Belichick and the rest. The Patriots will challenge everything Jones does: his attention to detail, cadence, reads, tendencies, everything, and that will only help him moving forward.\n\nHow they'll win\n\nGiants: Well, Shurmur insists there are no moral victories ... but if there were, hanging in there against these Patriots would provide one. There needs to be an emphasis on protecting Jones. Be smart. But you can gain a lot from this kind of challenge if you handle it the right way. This is when you learn about the players you have on this roster. Play Corey Ballentine and Julian Love some on defense. Watch how Dexter Lawrence, B.J. Hill, Dalvin Tomlinson and Oshane Ximines compete. Also, stay healthy. The Giants will be without Saquon Barkley (ankle), Sterling Shepard (concussion) and Evan Engram (knee) - the three top weapons on offense - in addition to Wayne Gallman (concussion). So they have two healthy backs (rookie Jon Hilliman and fullback Eli Penny) and four healthy wide receivers (Golden Tate, rookie Darius Slayton, Cody Latimer and Cody Core).\n\nPatriots: The Patriots are the only team in the NFL with a Top 3 scoring offense and a Top 3 scoring defense. Eight players have at least one sack. They have 11 interceptions. Jones is the 116th starting quarterback Tom Brady has faced off against in his career. Brady has thrown for 1,409 yards and 10 touchdowns with two interceptions, connecting with seven different receivers for scores. So the Patriots have the six-time Super Bowl quarterback directing a high-powered offense and the defense has given up 34 points through five games, the fifth-fewest for a team through five games since the 1970 merger.", "description": "The shorthanded Giants head up to Foxborough to play the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots hoping to compete and prove themselves in prime time", "authors": ["Art Stapleton", "Published A.M.
