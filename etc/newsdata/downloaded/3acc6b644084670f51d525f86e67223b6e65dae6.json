They generate grudges out of the night sky. After the baseball, that\u2019s what they\u2019re best at. First you are unworthy. That\u2019s how it starts. See the banners? See the monuments? Smell the history?\n\nThen, show a little fight, win a game or two, put a few people in this joint, gets dark, man. Gets mean. Gets desperate. Gets personal.\n\nGets beautiful.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAlso, a little grabby. Maybe too generous with miscellaneous items that have some carry to them. Profane, at times.\n\nBut, up in the shadows of the frieze, down in the cacophony of the bleachers, along the lines where they pound the padding with hands reddened by the cold, that\u2019s where the 1 or 2 percent that isn\u2019t just the baseball lives. The glorious, raw, beautiful ugliness of it all.\n\nTo win games at Yankee Stadium in October, even with the better squad, requires a certain constitution and, turns out for the Houston Astros, a couple three-run homers. To win games like Game 4 of the American League Championship Series on Thursday night, to play to the verge of the World Series, you have to look around, take it in, pull up your collar, and kind of like it. Decide, man, this is the greatest.\n\n\u201cMe, personally, not at all,\u201d Astros outfielder Josh Reddick insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can enjoy it.\u201d\n\nHe grinned, as much for the three-games-to-one lead than the question or his answer to it.\n\nHouston Astros shortstop Carlos Correa (1) celebrates with Robinson Chirinos (28) after hitting a three-run home run against the New York Yankees during the sixth inning of Game 4 of baseball's American League Championship Series, Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019, in New York. (Seth Wenig/AP)\n\nSo the Astros of 107 wins, of at least 101 wins for three seasons running, of the World Series title that followed the first of those, of 35 postseason games over most of these three Octobers, on a Thursday night in the third week of this October soaked it all in and won again, by an 8-3 score. With neither Justin Verlander nor Gerrit Cole on the mound. Verlander goes Friday night.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the clock struck midnight and the people left their blue seats behind, and the Astros kept hitting, and the Yankees made another error \u2014 their fourth \u2014 the orange revealed itself, some in tiny pockets, a few speckled here and there. By the bottom of the ninth, they chanted \u201cLet\u2019s go Astros\u201d and the remaining Yankees fans left them to it. The Astros, the relentlessness and tightness of their game, had emptied the place out. Nearing the end of a week in which they\u2019d been accused of stealing signs, whistling in codes, threading subtleties out of opposing pitchers\u2019 movements and various other acts of nefariousness, they stood in the middle of all this and put the bat head on the baseball, caught the baseball, threw the baseball by them, and shook hands with each other.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d said third baseman Alex Bregman. \u201cI don\u2019t know, like you\u2019re in the middle of this boxing match. \u2026 There\u2019s madness going on all around you and just play the game you\u2019ve played ever since you were a kid. I love it. It\u2019s a blast.\u201d\n\nEven Reddick, who must stand in that cramped right field with three tiers rising over his shoulder, and then wear the insults heaved without regard to decency, and who hasn\u2019t yet come around to exactly liking it, could offer a soft appreciation for the place.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get anything thrown at me tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nAsked if he\u2019d decided they hated him personally or if he just happened to be the closest Astro to them, he said, \u201cProbably a little bit of both. I\u2019m a loudmouth and speak my mind.\u201d\n\nThey would, then, have a little something in common, Reddick and the folks stomping and shouting behind him. And they would finally, eventually, get bored and turn on someone else, in a game that slipped slowly toward the Astros. They booed their own players instead. They booed the general outcomes of ground balls sprung from gloves and empty at-bats and the state of a series that for a moment -- after a split of two games in Houston \u2014 seemed to lean to the Yankees. What was left to cheer was CC Sabathia\u2019s game attempt to continue, when he couldn\u2019t. And they cheered when Robinson Chirinos, the Astros catcher, was hit by a pitch in the eighth.\n\nCarlos Correa hit one of two three-run home runs for the Houston Astros in ALCS Game 4. (Mike Stobe/Getty Images)\n\nReliever Ryan Pressly\u2019s two outs in the fifth inning with the bases loaded with Yankees \u2014 strikeouts of Gleyber Torres and Edwin Encarnacion \u2014 and those three-run home runs from George Springer and Carlos Correa and inning after inning of lockdown relief beyond Pressly \u2014 Will Harris, Joe Smith, Roberto Osuna \u2014 had turned Yankee Stadium on itself. That\u2019s how nearly 50,000 sparks of madness go quiet, pack up and make hollow promises to come back tomorrow and encourage the first of the three wins that would make this right.\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of the place and the people who fill it, how it all inches so close to the edge, particularly at this time of year. And then, also, for what it drags from the men in the arena, the real villains, the guys doing all the pitching and hitting and catching. And winning. Who, by the end, could hear their families cheering from somewhere beyond their dugout, because they were about the only ones left.\n\nJosh Reddick nodded at the memory. That part he liked.\n\n\u201cI think winning three straight in their ballpark,\u201d he said, \u201cis going to be better than that.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "To win games like Game 4 of the American League Championship Series on Thursday night, to play to the verge of the World Series, you have to look around, take it in, pull up your collar, and kind of like it.
