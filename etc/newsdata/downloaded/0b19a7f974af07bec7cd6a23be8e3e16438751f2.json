The Clinton and Nixon impeachment processes both began with a private investigation to gather facts before taking those facts public, as did the Republican-led House Select Committee on Benghazi\u2019s investigation.\n\nBut the Trump impeachment investigation is likely to go public very soon. According to the Washington Post, public hearings could begin as soon as mid-November. The hearings may give Democrats their best chance to make the case to voters that Trump\u2019s actions warrant removing him from office.\n\nOn the other hand, there are few spectacles in Washington that are more useless than the typical congressional hearing.\n\nUnprepared members of Congress, often racing from a fundraiser or a meeting with a lobbyist, read staff-prepared questions with little time to follow up. In the House of Representatives, each member may have only five minutes of questioning time before the talking stick is passed to someone else \u2014 typically a member of the other party.\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to keep a narrative going, or to wear down a witness. The topic of questioning can change every time a new lawmaker begins their time at the mic. When a particularly effective questioner gets a chance to speak, hostile witnesses can filibuster until the end of that lawmaker\u2019s time. And every time a member of the opposing party steps up, the questions can rapidly descend into conspiracy theories touted by the least responsible conservative outlets.\n\nMaybe this disjointed feast of grandstanding is good enough for a hearing investigating how a deputy undersecretary managed a federal grant program. But it is no way to bring down a president. Just think of last July\u2019s hearing with special counsel Robert Mueller, a debacle for Democrats, where Democratic lawmakers struggled to extract interesting answers from a surprisingly reluctant witness \u2014 while many Republicans touted conspiracy theories about Russian false flags and secret \u201cWestern\u201d intelligence operatives.\n\nIf Democrats want the Trump impeachment hearings to succeed, they cannot rely on a process that seems designed to ensure that every member of the committee gets five minutes of screen time and to accomplish little else.\n\nThe hearings are all the more important because it is so unlikely that the Republican-controlled Senate will ultimately vote to remove Trump from office. As a constitutional matter, the House could hold an impeachment vote whenever it wants, with or without hearings.\n\nBut, as a practical matter, the impeachment hearings are Democrats\u2019 opportunity to argue before a jury consisting of the entire American electorate.\n\nDemocrats \u201cshould remember that this isn\u2019t a criminal trial, and their job isn\u2019t to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump committed some particular crime,\u201d Josh Chafetz, a law professor at Cornell and the author of Congress\u2019s Constitution: Legislative Authority and the Separation of Powers, told me. \u201cTheir job is to convince the American public that Trump should be removed from office.\u201d\n\nThere is no surefire way to ensure that the Trump impeachment hearings will end with Trump being removed from office, or even that they will convince the public at large that Trump is unfit for the presidency. But there are ways to maximize the chance that the hearings will prove their case.\n\nThe hearings should not waste time. They should not get bogged down in procedural fights. And, above all, they should be conducted by professionals who know how to win over a jury as large as the entire American electorate.\n\nWhere things stand right now\n\nFor the moment, the impeachment process looks fairly disjointed.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in late September, not long after news of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president broke, that the House would hold an official impeachment inquiry. That inquiry is spread across six different committees \u2014 the House committees on the Judiciary, Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, Foreign Affairs, Financial Services, and Ways and Means. Thus far, the Intelligence Committee has taken the lead on the inquiry into Trump\u2019s Ukraine call.\n\nThe advantage of spreading the inquiry out over many committees is that it allows members of Congress who are accustomed to working on particular issues to specialize in the parts of the impeachment inquiry where they are most knowledgeable. It also avoids a turf war among lawmakers who might be upset if they were excluded from the investigation.\n\nThe disadvantage is that the hearings can quickly become sprawling and difficult to keep up with. Committees are likely to move at different paces, and to roll out news as they uncover it. Multiple hearings could occur on the same day, and it can be difficult for voters to tell which hearing is the most important.\n\nMuch of the investigation, moreover, takes place in private. These closed-door sessions are an ordinary part of the investigative process \u2014 it\u2019s a good idea to know what potential witnesses may say before putting them on television \u2014 and some of the same witnesses may testify openly in later hearings. But the closed-door meetings also fueled Republican conspiracy theories about what\u2019s going on in the private sessions.\n\nEventually, however, there are likely to be public impeachment hearings on Ukraine, and potentially on other issues that arise during the impeachment inquiry. When that happens, Democrats can take several steps to maximize the effectiveness of the hearing and to minimize Republicans\u2019 chances of turning them into an easily forgotten spectacle.\n\nQuestions should be asked by a professional prosecutor, not by members of Congress\n\nThere is an entire profession devoted to the task of convincing lay people that a person accused of a crime is guilty: prosecutors.\n\nIf Democrats want the impeachment hearings to succeed, they shouldn\u2019t send amateurs \u2014 even amateur members of Congress \u2014 to do a professional\u2019s job.\n\nThis has been evident to members of Congress investigating past scandals, who have brought in outside prosecutors to do at least some of the questioning. As attorney Seth Rosenthal notes in a 2007 paper arguing that Supreme Court confirmation hearings should be led by expert counsel: \u201cCongress has tasked outside counsel with leading the investigations into and conducting questioning at hearings on the following matters, among others: Watergate; the Iran-Contra scandal; the Keating Five scandal; and Whitewater.\u201d\n\nOne of the turning points in the Watergate investigation, for example, came when Nixon aide Alexander Butterfield revealed to Senate Watergate Committee Chief Counsel Samuel Dash \u2014 the lawyer the Senate brought on to question witnesses \u2014 that the president knew that the Oval Office was bugged. Dash \u201cbecame known for his measured questioning of White House witnesses, slowly drawing out answers that sometimes struck like bombshells,\u201d according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cButterfield\u2019s revelation that Nixon himself knew his office was bugged led directly to the supreme court decision, in United States v Nixon, that the president must hand over the tapes\u201d the Guardian noted in its obituary of Dash. \u201cAnd, that decision led, in August 1974, to Nixon\u2019s forced resignation.\u201d\n\nIt is, of course, impossible to know if Watergate would have ended differently if Dash hadn\u2019t been present. But, by bringing in a former prosecutor to question White House witnesses, Senate investigators helped ensure that his questions would be conducted with a degree of skill and professionalism.\n\nOf course, there are some members of Congress who are, themselves, former prosecutors. But one reason to turn questioning over to a full-time lawyer is simply that this lawyer could devote all their time to building the case against Trump. A member of Congress simply doesn\u2019t have the capacity to do that.\n\nTo begin with, members of Congress spend an obscene amount of time raising money. As former Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY) noted in a 2016 op-ed, in less than 16 years in Congress \u201cI\u2019ve spent roughly 4,200 hours in call time, attended more than 1,600 fund-raisers just for my own campaign and raised nearly $20 million in increments of $1,000, $2,500 and $5,000 per election cycle.\u201d\n\nWhen they aren\u2019t raising money, members of Congress often spend hours of time each day meeting with constituents and lobbyists about issues that range from historically important to parochial. But few of these meetings will involve impeachment. Most members also spend hours \u2014 perhaps as much as 10-12 hours in many weeks for lawmakers from western states \u2014 in airports and on airplanes flying to and from their district.\n\nThe result is that representatives, even those with distinguished careers as prosecutors in their pasts, rarely have enough time to adequately prepare for hearings. To be sure, members of Congress are likely to spend much more time preparing for a historic showdown with a hated president than they put into the typical hearing. But their jobs as lawmakers will unavoidably pull them in many directions.\n\nAs Reece Rushing, who served as director of Oversight and Investigations for Democrats on the House Natural Resources Committee, told me, lawmakers are often completely dependent on staff to write their questions \u2014 and the ones who tried to come up with their own questions typically made matters worse. Committees have better hearings, according to Rushing, when \u201cmembers did not deviate from the prepared material.\u201d\n\nMembers of Congress are \u201cjust sort of a mouthpiece\u201d for their staff at these hearings. They simply \u201cdon\u2019t have the time\u201d to know all the details a questioner needs to know to conduct an effective interrogation on their own, Rushing said.\n\nOne caveat is that turning question time entirely over to professional counsel would likely require the House to change its rules \u2014 though the rules do allow counsel to share question time with members of Congress. Currently, those rules allow a committee to give a staff member the power to question a witness, but this time must be split evenly between the majority and the minority parties, and \u201cmay not exceed one hour in the aggregate.\u201d\n\nBut even just a half-hour of professional questioning per witness would be preferable to the way House committees typically operate.\n\nThe most skilled questioner should receive extra time\n\nRealistically, it is unlikely that lawmakers will fully relinquish their questioning time to a professional prosecutor. Nor does history suggest that they need to fully relinquish this role in order to hold successful hearings. The Senate Watergate hearings split questioning between senators and professional counsel. One of the most memorable moments of those hearings was Sen. Howard Baker\u2019s (R-TN) question to White House Counsel John Dean: \u201cWhat did the president know, and when did he know it?\u201d\n\nBut even though lawmakers will almost certainly spend some time questioning witnesses, there are ways to ensure that the most effective questioners receive additional time.\n\nThe House Rules typically limit questioning to five minutes per member at hearings, but the same rules provide that \u201ca committee may adopt a rule or motion permitting a specified number of its members to question a witness for longer than five minutes,\u201d provided that the amount of extended time is divided equally between the majority and the minority and does not exceed one hour per witness.\n\nThere are plenty of lawmakers who \u201chave actually practiced law\u201d and these members are more likely to be effective questioners than their colleagues, as Molly Claflin, chief oversight counsel at activist watchdog group American Oversight and a former counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, told me.\n\nRushing noted that it may also be possible for members to yield time to others: \u201cIt could be a smart move,\u201d for example, \u201cto have members give back their time\u201d to the chair.\n\nHaving one person conduct questioning, Claflin said, would \u201cbe more effective because you will still have one train of thought.\u201d This avoids a situation where the \u201dnext person comes on and then we\u2019ve switched topics altogether.\u201d\n\nIt also avoids a situation where even Democratic members may subvert the hearings for their own selfish interests. Members in heavily Democratic districts may be tempted to use the hearing to give a long, angry speech about why Trump is terrible \u2014 the sort of thing that could earn them positive coverage at home but that will do little to advance the case for impeachment.\n\nDemocrats in swing districts, meanwhile, could go to such lengths to avoid looking like partisans that their questions could undermine their party\u2019s broader case \u2014 and some of these members might actually prefer to pass their time to someone else so that they don\u2019t become the face of impeachment back home.\n\nDon\u2019t count on the courts\n\nThe hearings are also important because Democrats are unlikely to be able to make their case in the courts, or even by uncovering documents the White House wishes to keep secret.\n\nLast May, federal Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Trump\u2019s accounting firm must turn over financial documents sought by House investigators, and a federal appeals court upheld that decision earlier this month. Yet House investigators still do not have the documents. And, it is likely to be months or even potentially more than a year before the House\u2019s subpoena is enforced, and that\u2019s assuming that the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t ultimately side with Trump.\n\nThe point is that the wheels of the law turn very slowly, and a court victory that takes months or years to win may be no victory at all.\n\n\u201cThe law may be on your side,\u201d Rushing said, \u201cbut time isn\u2019t.\u201d If Democrats go hunting for incriminating documents that will turn the nation hard against Trump, they may find them \u2014 in 2021.\n\nA closely related risk is that a battle over subpoenas can quickly transform a conversation about a gross betrayal of the public trust into a conversation about eye-glazing topics like executive privilege. \u201cOutside of about a one-mile radius around the Capitol Building, no one really cares about process,\u201d Claflin said.\n\nEvery minute the news focuses on whether the White House should turn over documents is a minute the news is not focused on Trump\u2019s attempt to shakedown a foreign leader for personal gain. And that\u2019s a gift to Donald Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s important, in other words, to not let a bunch of process fights cover up the fact that Democrats already have damning evidence against the president. Democrats, in Rushing\u2019s words, are \u201cstarting out with the smoking gun.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment process began after the White House released a readout of a call where Trump suggested that US military assistance for Ukraine would be contingent upon Ukraine doing political favors for Trump. White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admitted on national television that this was a quid pro quo \u2014 although he later, somewhat incompetently, tried to walk that admission back. And senior administration officials testified in private sessions that Trump made \u201csecurity assistance money\u201d contingent upon political favors.\n\nSubpoenaed documents and the like may help bolster the case against Trump, but the House investigation began very close to its conclusion.\n\nThe Watergate scandal was a drama that took years to unfold \u2014 beginning with a June 17, 1972 break-in at the Watergate Hotel and culminating in the August 5, 1974 release of the \u201csmoking gun tape,\u201d where President Nixon is caught on tape conspiring to shut down the investigation into this break-in.\n\nDemocrats do not need to spend months or years hunting for a similarly damning piece of evidence because they already have it. They just need to make sure that the American people understand what they have.\n\nListen to Today, Explained\n\nPresident Pence? President Pelosi?
