I am sorry,\" Rodriguez told her 4.4 million followers. \"I am sorry if I offended anyone by singing along to The Fugees, to a song I love, that I grew up on. I love Lauryn Hill. And I really am sorry if I offended you..\"\n\nRepresentatives for Rodriguez did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nRodriguez, who also starred in \"Miss Bala\" and voices Carmen Sandiego in the animated Netflix series, was under fire earlier this year for comments she made about pay disparities between women of different races, which were perceived by critics as anti-black.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI get so petrified in this space talking about equal pay especially when you look at the intersectional aspect of it, right? Where white women get paid more than black women, black women get paid more than Asian women, Asian women get paid more than Latina women, and it\u2019s, like, a very scary space to step into,\u201d Rodriguez said at the time.\n\nRodriguez later offered a tearful apology and acknowledged the hurt she felt for being called \"anti-black.\"\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have many Latino shows and the black community made me feel like I was seen, so to get anti-black is to say I\u2019m anti-family,\u201d she said. \u201cI know my heart, I know what I meant.\u201d\n\nFox News' Tyler McCarthy contributed to this report.", "description": "Actress Gina Rodriguez is facing heavy backlash for using the n-word on Instagram on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
