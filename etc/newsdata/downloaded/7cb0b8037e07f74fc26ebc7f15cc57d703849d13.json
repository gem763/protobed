An investigation is under way.\n\nTrump abortion \u2018gag rule\u2019 leaves poor patients \u2018with nowhere to go\u2019 in US Read more\n\nKlopfer, who died on 3 September, worked at an abortion clinic in South Bend, Indiana. It closed after the state revoked the clinic\u2019s license in 2015.\n\nThe Indiana state health department had previously issued complaints against the clinic, accusing it of lacking a registry of patients, policies regarding medical abortion, and a governing body to determine policies.\n\nThe state agency also accused the clinic of failing to document that patients received state-mandated education at least 18 hours before an abortion.\n\nKlopfer was believed to be Indiana\u2019s most prolific abortion doctor, with thousands of procedures performed in multiple Indiana counties over several decades, the South Bend Tribune reported.\n\nMike Fichter, the president of Indiana Right to Life, said in a statement on Friday night that \u201cwe are horrified\u201d by the discovery of the remains. He called for Indiana authorities to help determine whether those remains have any connection to abortion operations in Indiana.\n\n\u201cThese sickening reports underscore why the abortion industry must be held to the highest scrutiny,\u201d Fichter said in the statement.\n\nThe office of Indiana\u2019s governor, Eric Holcomb, did not immediately respond to a message asking if Indiana officials would investigate.\n\nKlopfer\u2019s license was suspended by Indiana\u2019s medical licensing board in November 2016 after the panel found a number of violations, including a failure to ensure that qualified staff were present when patients received or recovered from medications given before and during abortion procedures.\n\nKlopfer was no longer practising by that time, but he told the panel he had never lost a patient in 43 years of doing abortions and that he hoped to eventually reopen his clinics.\n\nIn June 2014, Klopfer was charged in St Joseph County, Indiana, for failure to file a timely public report. He was accused of waiting months to report an abortion he provided to a 13-year-old girl in South Bend. That charge was later dropped after Klopfer completed a pre-trial diversion program.\n\nRepublican representative, Jackie Walorski, called the discovery of the remains \u201csickening beyond words\u201d in a statement released by her office.\n\n\u201cHe was responsible for thousands of abortions in Indiana, and his careless treatment of human remains is an outrage,\u201d she said in her statement.\n\nIn May, the US supreme court upheld an Indiana law requiring the burial or cremation of foetal remains following abortions in the state. That law was signed by the vice president, Mike Pence, in 2016 when he was Indiana\u2019s governor, but it was the subject of legal challenges.\n\nThe Indiana State Department of Health, which oversees abortion clinic regulation, has integrated that law\u2019s provisions into the agency\u2019s existing licensing process.\n\nPrior to the ruling, Indiana clinics could turn over foetal remains to processors who handle the disposal of human tissues or other medical material by incineration.", "description": "Authorities uncover thousands of preserved remains at the home of Ulrich Klopfer", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc2ead4a381c5c3612e2938f377568fd6d6d8e9a/68_0_1865_1119/master/1865.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2a5023127c881045458cd88826de911d", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
