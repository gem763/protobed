Since children are dependent, they are most likely to adopt their parents\u2019 behaviour. As a result they will land up facing the consequences of their parents\u2019 behaviour. They are likely to face negativity or positivity depending on their parents\u2019 karma.\n\n\n\nThis does not mean karma has been passed to the child. For instance, if a person builds a house and lives in it with his family, everyone enjoys living in the house, but the house is owned by the parent only.\n\n\n\nKarma instructs: we reap what we sow. That means we must eventually face the consequences of actions we did in our past. Every individual brings along his own fate and destiny, which may come into effect now or later. However, karmic timing is a curious thing. And you are the one who will face the actual consequences of your past actions.\n\n\n\nWe all have our own karmic account and we get a life according to that. But if we become part or reason for other\u2019s happiness and sadness, then we also accumulate or become part of that karma.\n\n\n\nThe karma of parents in the current life does not affect their child\u2019s karma, unless the child chooses to follow in the steps of the parents.\n\n\n\n\u25a0 Follow Surakshitji at speakingtree.in\n\nDo you have a question for Surakshitji?
