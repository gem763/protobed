I've made that decision. I have no idea what the outcome will be.\n\nMr Grieve, a former attorney general and mastermind of several backbench revolts against the Government, confirmed he will run again in Beaconsfield\n\nMs Sandbach (left) said she would also go head-to-head with a Tory in Eddisbury, Cheshire.\n\n'Logically, I probably ought to lose. It's a very safe Conservative seat.\n\n'And if normal loyalties prevail then a Conservative candidate will be elected against me.\n\n'But I think my constituents are entitled to a choice.'\n\nEarlier this month it was revealed that the Lib Dems were planning to give him a free run at the seat to better his chances of winning.\n\nThe Lib Dem candidate, teacher and musician Rob Castell, agreed to drop out to avoid taking Remain votes away from Mr Grieve in a seat that voted 51-49 to stay in the EU in 2016.\n\nMr Grieve took the seat in 2017 for the Tories with a majority of 24,543 from Labour in second.\n\nMs Sandbach blasted the 'toxic' atmosphere in politics a fortnight ago as she revealed she received a death threat after being deselected as a candidate by her local party.\n\nShe told how she received an email saying that Remain-backing MPs should 'keep looking over your shoulders because Boom Bang you are all dead'.\n\nThe message, which she posted on Twitter, came after she lost a vote of confidence among members of her local Conservative Party association.\n\nIt effectively barred her from standing for them at the next general election, even if she has the whip restored first.\n\nBut she told the BBC today she was not joining the ranks of those MPs standing down at the election.\n\nShe said: 'I will be standing in Eddisbury. I've got a very strong local record.\n\n'I have secured \u00a395million of investment locally into Eddisbury, not from Government but from private investors and I think my constituents will see that I have always stood up and spoken for what I believe to be in our best interests.'", "description": "They were among 21 Conservatives stripped of the whip in September after voting to block a No deal Brexit.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/18/20390148-0-image-a-40_1572460315021.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
