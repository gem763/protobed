I have never been so tired,\u201d gasped Leclerc as a sea of fans, starved of success at Monza since Fernando Alonso won in the red overalls, swept onto the pit straight to party below the overhanging podium with flags and flares.\n\n\u201cWinning here is just a dream,\u201d continued the winner, switching to fluent Italian to address a crowd cheering a fitting triumph on the 90th anniversary of both Monza and Formula One\u2019s most glamorous team.\n\n\u201cLast weekend (in Belgium) was my first victory, but the emotion of winning here is 10 times that,\u201d said Leclerc, now a two-times winner \u2014 and Ferrari\u2019s sole one so far this season \u2014 in only his 14th race for Ferrari.\n\n\u201cThanks to everybody. I have no words.\n\nHamilton\u2019s lead over closest rival Bottas was cut to 63 points from 65, with the Briton limiting the damage by making a late pitstop for fresh tyres to set the fastest lap and gain an extra point.\n\n\u201cHe did a great job, congratulations to Ferrari,\u201d said Hamilton, who took the fight to Leclerc from the start but dropped behind Bottas 10 laps from the end when he cut the first chicane.\n\n\u201cA lot of pressure from both Valtteri and I. I did the best I could. Obviously following so closely for such a long time, the tyres eventually just went off the cliff.\n\n\u201cBut nevertheless they were just quicker today, quicker in a straight line, so even if we did get close we couldn\u2019t pass. So not our day but still strong points for the team,\u201d added the 34-year-old.\n\nVETTEL NIGHTMARE\n\nLeclerc\u2019s German team mate Sebastian Vettel had an afternoon to forget, going from bad to worse at the one circuit where every Ferrari driver wants to impress.\n\nWhile Leclerc led from pole position, the four-times champion spun off, plunged to last place and served a 10 second stop/go penalty for a dangerous return to the track.\n\nHe was then lapped by his impressive team mate, who is now 13 points above him in the standings and fast becoming the main man at Maranello.\n\nMercedes lead Ferrari in the constructors\u2019 standings by 154 points.\n\nStewards also handed Vettel three penalty points, taking his 12 month tally to nine. Three more in the next three races will trigger a one-race ban.\n\n\u201cI lost the rear, a mistake by me,\u201d the German, 13th at the flag, said of the incident. \u201cA good day for the team but not good on my side.
