This is a vital first move to help achieve these goals,\" he added.\n\nVaping concerns\n\nAmong its new category products is the Vype e-cigarette, which it launched in 2013.\n\nBAT's emphasis on \"new categories\" comes amid signs that US regulators are preparing to take a tougher stance on e-cigarettes.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced that his administration would ban flavoured e-cigarettes after a spate of vaping-related deaths.\n\nUS Health Secretary Alex Azar said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would finalise a plan to take all non-tobacco flavours off the market.\n\nEarlier this week, US First Lady Melania Trump tweeted that she was \"deeply concerned about the growing epidemic of e-cigarette use in our children\".\n\n\"The regulatory pressure on the tobacco industry just dialled up a notch,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\nHe said tobacco firms had turned their attention to e-cigarettes because of falling numbers of smokers and stricter rules in developing countries.\n\n\"What's being announced across the Atlantic could see those plans go up in smoke, particularly given the size of that market. After all, it's not just the young who opt for flavoured vaping products,\" he added.\n\n\"Today's announcement represents a bold first step for new chief executive Jack Bowles, but he must hope the crackdown on vaping doesn't see his growth ambitions run out of puff.\"", "description": "The firm wants to shed management layers as it focuses on e-cigarettes and other new products.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/263E/production/_92009790_vtpo11ty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
