The invasion began shortly after Washington announced it would relocate the 50 troops present in the area to elsewhere in Syria, taking them out of the way of the Turkish military.\n\nTurkey is a NATO ally, meaning the United States is bound by treaty to defend the country in case of an invasion. Article 5 of the NATO treaty has only been invoked once \u2013 by America in a call to send NATO troops to Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001, jihadist attacks.\n\nThe SDF is also allied with America, though as a non-state actor, Washington has no responsibility by treaty to defend the group. Most of its members belong to the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ), Rojava\u2019s Kurdish army. The SDF eliminated the Islamic State\u2019s presence in Raqqa, the jihadist group\u2019s \u201ccapital,\u201d and is currently holding thousands of jihadists prisoner in territories that Turkey has begun to attack.\n\nTurkey considers the SDF indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a U.S.-designated Marxist terrorist organization active in Turkey.\n\nIn a press statement Thursday, the SDF claimed that it had \u201cfrustrated\u201d Turkey\u2019s attempts at taking over Kurdish towns.\n\n\u201cSyrian Democratic Forces confronted a field incursion attempt by the Turkish occupation army in the hub of Tal Halaf and Sluk city,\u201d the group said, adding that Islamic State elements appeared to take advantage of the chaos to attack Kurdish soldiers.\n\nFirat News Agency, an Amsterdam-based outlet that the BBC has described as \u201cpro-PKK,\u201d published details of a press release on Friday from the SDF that claimed the Kurds had killed hundreds more Turkish soldiers \u201cand terrorists\u201d \u2013 meaning members of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) \u2013 than the 16 SDF fighters allegedly killed in battle since \u201cPeace Spring\u201d began.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the clashes on the two mentioned dates, 16 of our heroic comrades were martyred,\u201d the SDF said. \u201cAs a result of the clashes during the mentioned dates, 262 Turkish-backed jihadists were killed.\u201d\n\nThe press release also says \u201cmany\u201d civilians were killed in Turkey\u2019s assault, which reportedly featured air attacks as well as tanks rolling into SDF territory.\n\nAnadolu Agency, the official news agency of the government of Turkey, placed the number of \u201cneutralized\u201d SDF forces, or \u201cterrorists,\u201d at far higher than 16. The Turkish government uses the word \u201cneutralize\u201d to include all fighters removed from the battlefield, either killed or taken prisoner. Anadolu did not identify how many of the \u201cneutralized\u201d were still alive.\n\n\u201cA total of 342 terrorists have been \u2018neutralized\u2019 since the start of Operation Peace Spring in northern Syria, Turkey\u2019s defense minister said on Friday,\u201d Anadolu reported. \u201cHulusi Akar\u2019s comments came after his meeting with top military officials in Turkey\u2019s capital Ankara, where he said \u2018every kind of measures have been taken\u2019 in operation areas.\u201d\n\nAkar called the operation \u201csuccessful\u201d so far despite SDF reports that the Turkish military had been \u201cfrustrated.\u201d\n\nThe last time Turkey attempted to invade Syria, in 2018\u2019s \u201cOperation Olive Branch,\u201d the YPG put up a much more formidable fight than the Turks had prepared for and, at one point, declared victory. Turkey captured the city of Afrin in Rojava in March as the YPG avoided further fighting in the service of preventing a massacre. By September, rumblings of a Kurdish challenge in Afrin began to resurface.\n\nThe battled-hardened YPG, on the heels of defeating the Islamic State, moved a significant challenge to Turkey despite not having its advanced weaponry or an air force. Erdogan purged his most capable military leaders and thousands in the rank and file, following a failed coup attempt he suffered in 2016, leaving the Turkish military significantly weakened.\n\nThe Turkish army appears to be relying heavily on air support for \u201cOperation Peace Spring,\u201d but it is also driving armored vehicles into captured towns. On Friday, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported seeing \u201cdozens\u201d of Turkish army vehicles crossing the border into Syria and cited the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), an NGO operating in the country, as having evidence of Turkish soldiers capturing 11 villages.\n\nThe Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) of Iraq, which has long had icy relations with the PKK and YPG, issued a statement following the launch of the operation Tuesday, urging Turkey, with whom it has maintained friendly ties, to stop its invasion.\n\n\u201cThe government calls on Turkey, as a member of the Global Coalition, to avoid any initiative that would undermine the progress made against ISIS, including jeopardizing the secure detention of terrorist fighters,\u201d the KRG said, according to the Kurdish outlet Rudaw. \u201cThe consequences of military escalation have implications far beyond Syria\u2019s borders, creating the conditions for a return of ISIS and a mass displacement of people.\u201d\n\nThe KRG\u2019s fighters, the Peshmerga, have also waged a years-long battle against the Islamic State.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Turkish government outlets and the Syrian Defense Forces (SDF) offered wildly differing death tolls on both sides on Friday.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Turkish-army-vehicles-Turkish-Kurdish-battle-Operation-Peace-Spring-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
