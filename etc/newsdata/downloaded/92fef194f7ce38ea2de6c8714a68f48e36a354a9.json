Today, servers across that continent are paid living wages and don\u2019t rely on crowdfunded generosity.\n\nThe United States, founded as a rebuke to the old world, has allowed a de facto aristocracy to bloom in our country, where low taxes on the rich, combined with meager welfare for the poor, lead to income inequality reminiscent of a feudal state. Tips are a tiny part of that big picture. But they\u2019re a perfect representation of the philosophy that underlies it: Tipping survives because of the notion that industriousness must be coaxed from individuals through constant threat of their immiseration.\n\nService workers are trained to play a game\u2014smile for 20 percent and wink for 30. But the game is worse than dubious; it might not exist at all. The lesson of the Uber paper is that tips mostly aren\u2019t about service. The quality of the ride isn\u2019t nearly as important to a driver\u2019s bottom line as the characteristics of the stranger holding the phone that hails the car. As with so many other aspects of the economy, we sustain a false theory of merit-based rewards to explain a world often governed by dumb luck.", "description": "", "authors": ["Derek Thompson", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive American-Tipping-System-Makes-No-Sense"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
