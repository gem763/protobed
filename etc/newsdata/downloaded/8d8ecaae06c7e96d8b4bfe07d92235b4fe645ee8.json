According to sources at the NSC, Vindman does not wear his uniform to work at the NSC, where the standard dress is business wear.\n\nOne source said he donned the uniform \u201cjust for show.\u201d The source pointed out that Vindman was ironically wearing a presidential service badge on his uniform \u2014 as he testifies on his concerns about Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine policy.\n\nVindman\u2019s opening statement, which was leaked to the New York Times the night before his testimony, showed he was concerned that Ukraine helping investigate former Vice President Joe Biden would jeopardize bipartisan U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the Times, Vindman, who was born in Ukraine and is fluent in Ukrainian and Russia, may have served as an informal adviser to Ukrainian officials looking for advice on how to deal with Rudy Giuliani\u2019s efforts to investigate corruption by Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nAccording to the paper: \u201cHis heritage gave Colonel Vindman, who is fluent in both Ukrainian and Russian, unique insight into Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure campaign; on numerous occasions, Ukrainian officials sought him out for advice about how to deal with Mr. Giuliani.\u201d\n\nJohn Yoo, a former Bush administration Justice Department official, said Monday evening on Fox News\u2019 \u201cIngraham Angle\u201d that he found it \u201castounding\u201d that Vindman would be advising Ukrainian officials against Trump\u2019s interests.\n\n\u201cYou know, some people might call that espionage,\u201d Yoo said.\n\nSome mainstream media journalists noted Vindman arrived in \u201cfull uniform\u201d and criticized those who questioned Vindman\u2019s loyalty to the U.S.\n\nAlexander Vindman just entered the Capitol in full uniform to testify in the impeachment inquiry. Meantime, conservatives on cable TV are questioning his loyalty to the United States. \u2014 Abby D.
