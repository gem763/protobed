Stifel forecasts operating income of $2.40 billion versus FactSet guidance for $2.94 billion, down from $3.72 billion last year.\n\n\u201cWe support the company\u2019s investment in faster shipping in an effort to widen the convenience advantage over e-commerce and traditional retail peers,\u201d Stifel wrote.\n\n\u201cWe would be buyers on any weakness stemming from potentially lower margin as historically the company has emerged from past investment cycles in a stronger competitive position and generated stronger-than-expected operating income dollars.\u201d\n\nStifel rates Amazon stock buy with a $2,300 price target.\n\nAmazon has an average buy rating, according to 48 analysts polled by FactSet.
