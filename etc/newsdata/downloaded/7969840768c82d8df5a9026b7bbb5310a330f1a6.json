We did not play well enough, we conceded possession too cheaply, we did not create chances, we did not take good chances and we were too open out of possession, we gave the ball away,\u2019 said Southgate.\n\n\u2018We have to respond in the right way, we have a couple of days to prepare and we have to reward our supporters with a better performance. There were not many positives. We accept defeat, and accept we have to be better than we were. We weren\u2019t good enough.\n\nThe Three Lions took the lead but fell victim to a comeback defeat by the hosts\n\n\u2018It is going to be an interesting couple of days because we have not had a result like that or a performance like that and we will learn a lot about ourselves over the next 48 to 72 hours.\n\n\u2018We have to respond in the right way.\u2019\n\nSouthgate\u2019s ploy to play full debutant Mason Mount in the No 10 role appeared to backfire as England were over-run in midfield.\n\nThere were also question marks over Southgate\u2019s team-selection - and the England manager didn\u2019t shy away from those doubts saying: \u2018I always have to accept responsibility.\n\n\u2018That is the situation we are in but we collectively have to accept the result but as manager I have to accept it.\n\nSouthgate wants to hear no excuses and accepts his side were not good enough\n\n\u2018This is football \u2013 all the players in their careers, and for us as coaching staff, football is all about responding to setbacks. We have not had many so it feels more unpleasant and it is a while since we felt this way. That is the reality.\u2019\n\nCaptain Harry Kane insisted England must remain calm despite the loss but admitted the defeat underlines they are far from the finished product.\n\n\u2019We\u2019ll regroup, there\u2019s no need to panic,\u2019 said the striker.\n\n\u2018I think it was down to us (the defeat). We went ahead early and after that were sloppy with the ball.\n\n\u2018We weren\u2019t fighting and pressing as much as normally do. Unfortunately we gave one away at the end. Every away game in Europe is difficult.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s no excuse, we have to do better than tonight. We\u2019ve still got stuff to work on, and we can see that tonight.\u2019", "description": "SAMI MOKBEL AT THE SINOBO STADIUM: Gareth Southgate ordered England to muster an immediate response after admitting his side were dealt a deserved reality check in Prague last night.", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19609386-0-image-a-8_1570830653861.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
