The hostia is the body of Christ, the holy host, the consecrated bread, and bloody brilliant \u2013 a Spanish equivalent of the dog\u2019s dingly-danglies \u2013 and Real Madrid\u2019s manager was right. What Rodrygo had just done was special; where he had done it and when he had done it was, too. It was 10.30pm on Wednesday when Casemiro\u2019s long, high diagonal reached him way over on the left. His first touch was impeccable, the ball tamed with the outside of his right foot, supposedly the wrong one, and coaxed into obediently joining him as he set off. Five seconds later, it was in the net.\n\nHe was 94 seconds into his Real Madrid career.\n\nBarcelona fined only \u20ac300 for breaking rules when signing Antoine Griezmann Read more\n\nAs the ball dropped, TV commentator Jos\u00e9 Sanch\u00eds had cooed: \u201cOh, I love that control.\u201d As it hit the back of the net, he had shouted: \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d All around him, they couldn\u2019t believe it, either. Some 57,270 people leapt. Lots laughed, which is what you\u2019re supposed to do when something like that happens. Suddenly, there was this 18-year-old they\u2019d never seen play kneeling then bowing before the Bernab\u00e9u, doffing an imaginary hat, and all was well with the world.\n\nIt had happened fast. Signed for \u20ac45m in 2018, Rodrygo didn\u2019t actually join Madrid until this summer and hadn\u2019t played a competitive game. At the weekend he didn\u2019t even play for Castilla, the B team, for whom he had missed a penalty in his only appearance. Instead he travelled with the first team to Sevilla only to be left out of the squad entirely. \u201cWe know exactly what we\u2019re doing with him,\u201d Zidane insisted on Tuesday and the following night he stood on the touchline with his arm around the Brazilian\u2019s shoulder, whispering in his ear. The clock showed 70.22 when Rodrygo ran on and, while it wasn\u2019t actually the first ball he touched, 71.56 when he scored to make it 2-0 against Osasuna.\n\nPremier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \ud83d\ude0e Just on the pitch a few seconds and what a cool finish this is from 18-year-old Rodrygo to make it 2-0!\n\n\n\n\u26aa What a night for Real Madrid's young Brazilians! pic.twitter.com/yYDmN4QfeC\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember a debut like this,\u201d Sanch\u00eds had said. Alongside him, Jorge Valdano noted: \u201cIt might not exist.\u201d\n\nThere have been pretty special starts for Madrid before: everyone remembers Robinho at C\u00e1diz, David Beckham had scored 124 seconds into his first game at the Bernab\u00e9u and there may, genuinely, never have been a beginning quite like Jonathan Woodgate\u2019s, which he neatly summed up in two words afterwards: \u201cfuck\u201d and \u201cme\u201d. But there haven\u2019t been many like this. Only two foreigners have scored for Madrid younger than Rodrygo \u2013 Rapha\u00ebl Varane and Vinicius \u2013 and no Madrid player has ever scored their first league goal faster. Only (original) Ronaldo, who\u2019d been at Barcelona before, scored quicker on his Madrid debut: it took him 64 seconds.\n\n\u201cIf I could control it well, I thought the rest would come off well,\u201d Rodrygo said afterwards, still in his kit, wearing flip-flops and looking every bit as young as he is. \u201cI don\u2019t really have the words for this. I\u2019m lucky.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nAnd so it starts; the excitement, the expectation, the pressure. A few metres away, beneath the Bernab\u00e9u stands, Osasuna\u2019s Fran M\u00e9rida, who joined Arsenal at 17, was asked if everyone risked running ahead of themselves. \u201cRodrygo\u2019s the one running,\u201d he said.\n\nWeek six had been marked by kids, born after 2000. Six hundred kilometres to the north-east they were still talking about Ansu Fati, again impressing for Barcelona\u2019s after a late cameo in a 2-1 win over Villarreal; 350km away on the east coast, Kang-in Lee had just scored his first for Valencia in a wild 3-3 draw with Getafe. Aged 18 years and seven months, only two younger players have ever scored for the club. Over in Palma, meanwhile, Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix scored the second in a 2-0 win over Mallorca. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s most expensive player ever, he\u2019s still only 19.\n\n'A star is born': Ansu Fati announces himself and changes his world | Sid Lowe Read more\n\nThey are related, especially at Barcelona and Madrid. As the radios raved, some of the same things said about Fati come up again. Not least because, in that tiresome way that it\u2019s always about them, the clubs that can\u2019t live with each other and can\u2019t live without each other either, Annie Oakley and Frank Butler going at it again. As if it\u2019s not hard enough to live with your own club\u2019s expectations; you have to match the expectations of your rivals too. Yet the concerns expressed parallels as well, an awareness of what could go wrong, of the warping power of expectation and pressure.\n\nBack at the Bernab\u00e9u, Merida said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to tell anyone how to handle it; there are no lessons.\u201d Yet there are many: countless examples and warnings, reasons why people try to rein in their excitement, even if they can\u2019t help it. There\u2019s always that slither of fear lurking in the excitement, a reluctance to emotionally invest, a concern at getting too excited and getting hurt, a resistance to playing a part in potential going unrealised and the dream dying. No one wants to be responsible somehow. Or, worse still, wrong.\n\nThere is a word used endlessly here that doesn\u2019t translate well: ilusi\u00f3n. A false friend \u2013 and rarely has that description fitted better \u2013 it\u2019s not illusion; it\u2019s more like hope, excitement, enthusiasm, joy, a dream even. And yet it can become an illusion too, sometimes precisely because of the ilusi\u00f3n. Bojan Krkic broke Barcelona records and it broke him for a while. Gerard Deulofeu was the best player many of them had seen. In the end, though, neither was the new anything. Robinho started as a saviour, but ended up as a triathlete in a joke: corre, bicicleta y nada, it runs and although it doesn\u2019t translate it\u2019s enough to know that, if a little unfairly, he became someone to laugh at.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rodrygo runs at Osasuna.

Light amid the gloom last season, the excitement building, a glorious future assumed and celebrated before it had actually happened, Vinicius\u2019s performances had delighted but then dipped. He had suffered injury and hadn\u2019t scored in 16 games. Chances slipped away, each more painful than the last. Then, at last, he bent a superb shot into the corner, taking a deflection en route. Madrid were 1-0 up and Vinicius slipped to his knees and sobbed, released at last.\n\n\u201cSince my injury, everything was hard,\u201d Vinicius said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the happy person I am. I have lifted that weight off now and I\u2019m delighted to please the Bernab\u00e9u again.\u201d\n\nPremier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \u26bd Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior curls one into the top corner to give Real Madrid the lead!\n\n\n\n\u2b50 It's the first goal of the season for the young Brazilian star, and look at what it means to him! pic.twitter.com/7inBbhtzZr\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for them; you could see the emotion when they scored, what it meant,\u201d Zidane said. \u201cWe sometimes forget they\u2019re both just 18.\u201d Vinicius is actually 19 now, but the point remained. And for all the lessons, the warnings, there are examples that say the opposite. The ilusi\u00f3n is natural, it is right: it\u2019s also the point. What is football, what is life, without it? Even the most rubbish teams live in hope. Iker Casillas was at school in a drawing class when they came for him; he won the World Cup. Valdano confided to Ra\u00fal that he was thinking of playing him but worried that he might freeze. Ra\u00fal, aged 17, replied: \u201cIf you want to win, put me in; if not, don\u2019t.\u201d He missed sitters that day, and became the best player Madrid ever brought through. And there was something about Messi.\n\nBesides, it is too often forgotten that there is dignity, joy and triumph in careers, even when they aren\u2019t what others demanded they become. There is life beyond those teams. There\u2019s a second chance. And a third, a fourth, a fifth. There\u2019s also time. Ask Bojan, finding satisfaction in his success, no one else\u2019s; finding enjoyment too. Ask 37-year-old Jorge Molina; Jaime Mata, who never even made it to primera until he was 29 and is now a Spain international; or Aritz Aduriz, whose goalscoring figures improved after he turned 30. Or ask Martin Odegaard, who joined Madrid at 16, disappeared to most Spaniards, and has now reappeared aged 20, years still ahead of him and playing for Real Sociedad, with a genuine claim to be the best player in La Liga so far this season. Or Sergio Canales, able to be himself on his own terms, one of Spain\u2019s outstanding players, an international many years and many injuries after that teenage move to the Bernab\u00e9u.\n\nBest of all, ask the two men who really marked week six in La Liga. Because while there\u2019s a thrill in seeing young players suddenly emerge, there\u2019s something special, maybe even deeper, in seeing the men who resist, who belie their years at the other end of the scale. If kids are alright, the adults might be even better. Especially when they are like these two, made to make you smile.\n\nSanti Cazorla is 34, has been operated on 10 times and was told he would be lucky to be able to walk around the garden with his son, but refused to give in and returned, still playing like no one else \u2013 included in last season\u2019s best XI in La Liga, he may be on course for this season\u2019s too. On Tuesday, he was handed a standing ovation by the Camp Nou, having outperformed everyone on the pitch and scored a brilliant goal. \u201cThat\u2019s what I will take with me when I retire,\u201d he said afterwards.\n\nPremier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) In 2016, Santi Cazorla was told he may never walk again\n\n\n\n2018: Re-signs with Villarreal \ud83d\udc9b\n\n\n\nLast night: Scores this screamer in the Nou Camp and went off to a standing ovation \ud83d\udd25\n\n\n\nSanti Cazorla, respect \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/TiThiLyfCV\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the man the Benito Villamar\u00edn rose to applaud a little over an hour earlier. Joaqu\u00edn S\u00e1nchez left to an ovation after a ludicrous performance every bit as good as anyone of any age anywhere had produced for months. Everybody\u2019s favourite cheeky scamp, he\u2019s also a brilliant footballer still, maybe even better than he\u2019s ever been. He provided three perfect assists as Betis beat Levante 3-1, and produced a piece of skill so brilliant, so absurd, so maddening, that all you could do was fall about the kind of trick that, as teammate Borja Iglesias put it, \u201creally, really pisses you off\u201d if you\u2019re an opponent: a cola de vaca nutmeg, sweeping the ball through the legs of poor To\u00f1o that drew ol\u00e9s from everyone.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joaqu\u00edn takes the crowd\u2019s acclaim.
