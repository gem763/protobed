REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/File Photo\n\nDropped into the role in 2010 after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster, 11 rig workers had just died and the company\u2019s finances were teetering.\n\nDudley had lived in Mississippi in his youth and spent his holidays fishing on the Gulf. He was now put in charge of cleaning up the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history in those very waters.\n\nAs BP scrambled to contain a crisis that threatened to take down a company after more than 100 years of operation, investors were running scared. Its market valued halved in two months as the scale of the disaster unfolded.\n\nDudley received an early morning phone call that marked what would be the \u201cworst moment\u201d, he told Reuters in an interview last year.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard that our debt was untradable back in the summer of 2010... To me that was a moment of the unthinkable was possible.\u201d\n\nThe feared collapse of BP did not come, but the onslaught did, with BP facing clean-up costs and lawsuits that would eventually top a staggering $75 billion.\n\nDudley needed to sell oil and gas assets to find the money and so the sell-off began, with BP eventually doing deals worth over $60 billion, including selling prized assets such as its Texas City refinery, Gulf of Mexico oilfields and Russian joint venture.\n\nHe shrank BP, but the drastic diet left Dudley in charge of a company fitter than some of rivals when the next challenge hit in the form of 2014\u2019s collapse in oil prices.\n\nThe slide would roll into early 2016, with Brent crude oil LCOc1 prices falling more than 70% to levels not seen since 2003 and companies reeling to cut costs.\n\nEARLY YEARS\n\nBorn in New York, Dudley grew up in Mississippi and later moved to Illinois where he attended university.\n\nHe entered the oil world in 1979 when joining U.S. firm Amoco, where he held a number of roles including working in Russia before BP took over the company in 1998 and retained his services.\n\nHis Russian experience helped Dudley win the top job at BP\u2019s Russian joint venture TNK-BP venture in 2003.\n\nFive years later Dudley made global headlines as he fled Russia fearing for his life after falling out with Russian oligarchs who accused Dudley of favouritism towards BP employees.\n\nDudley in turn accused the oligarchs of using the Kremlin and other Russian authorities to help settle purely commercial disputes.\n\nDespite the clash, Dudley\u2019s composed managerial style would again shine through as he later became one of the Kremlin\u2019s closest Western business allies.\n\nBP and the oligarchs would later sell TNK-BP to Russian oil producer Rosneft for over $50 billion.\n\nA quarter of BP\u2019s oil production now originates from Russia.\n\nIn March, Dudley helped organise a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and top UK businesses in a bid to smooth relations damaged by the poisoning in Britain of former double agent Sergei Skripal, for which Britain blames Russia.\n\n\u201cHe has led BP in a very wise, calm way over the last decade,\u201d BP Chairman Helge Lund told Reuters in an interview in June.\n\nUNFINISHED BUSINESS\n\nDudley oversaw not only BP\u2019s recovery from near collapse in 2010 but its rebound from the 2014 oil crisis.\n\nBut he leaves with one major unfinished task, namely, BP\u2019s transition to greener energy and lower emissions.\n\nAlthough BP has agreed to set targets to reduce some of its carbon emissions and increase spending on renewables, critics say under Dudley BP has done too little to reduce carbon emissions and increase investment in renewable energy.\n\nInstead, it has posted its fastest expansion in oil and gas production in decades, rising some 20% since 2016.\n\n\u201cFrom the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster to the climate emergency, Bob Dudley\u2019s tenure as BP\u2019s boss has been a failure,\u201d said John Sauven, executive director at Greenpeace UK.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Bob Dudley, Group Chief Executive of BP, speaks at the 2019 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., April 29, 2019.
