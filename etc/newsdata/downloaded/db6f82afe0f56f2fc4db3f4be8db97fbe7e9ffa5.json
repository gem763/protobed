Better consumer protection needs to be built into similar schemes in the future.\u2019\n\nThe committee said, if Help to Buy is to continue then its failings should be seriously considered and remedied.\n\nThe government also needs a plan to wean developers off their addiction to Help to Buy, unless we want to continue subsidising new home sales and big executive pay packets forever.", "description": "Say what you like about Help to Buy, but if economists in the future are ever looking for a case study of how to get a market addicted to a subsidy it has at least provided them with that.", "authors": ["Simon Lambert For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
