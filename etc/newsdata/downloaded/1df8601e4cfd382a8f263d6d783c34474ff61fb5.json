This can be attributed to a bounce back in consumer sentiment in September from an almost three-year low as well as better-than-expected retail sales in August. Thus, one thing that can be said with certainty is that households will continue to deliver for the economy, at least for now.\n\nU.S. consumer sentiment rebounded modestly this month. Per the University of Michigan, its consumer sentiment index came in at 92 in September, up from 89.8 in late August. Analysts had expected sentiment to rebound to 91.4. To top it, the current conditions index rose to 106.9 in September from 105.3 in the prior month. The index of expectations also climbed to 82.4 from 79.9 in August.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, sales at U.S. retailers rose 0.4% last month, mostly led by motor vehicle and online purchases, according to the Commerce Department. Retail sales climbed north after an upwardly revised 0.8% increase in July. By the way, the measure that excludes car dealers, food services, building materials, stores and gasoline stations rose 0.3%, on par with projections. Needless to say, this core retail sales measure is predominantly viewed as a more reliable gauge of underlying consumer demand.\n\nBuoyed by a resilient labor market and solid income gains, consumers are the primary source of firepower for economic growth amid moribund factory output. As a matter of fact, the latest retail sales report indicates another encouraging quarter of household consumption, which grew at the fastest pace in the April-June period since 2014.\n\nTin Quinlan, senior economist at Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) Securities, rightly pointed out that \u201cat a time when recession risk dominates most economic discussions, the strength of the U.S. consumer is among the more compelling examples of an economy that is still firing on all cylinders.\u201d\n\nThings Looking Up for Payment Stocks\n\nWith consumer spending picking up, there are certain companies that benefit more than others.
