(Mika\u00ebl Theimer/Montreal Museum of Fine Arts)\n\n\"We know that art stimulates neural activity,\" said Nathalie Bondil, the museum's director general and chief curator.\n\n\"What we see is that the fact that you are in contact with culture, with art, can really help your well-being.\"", "description": "About 230,000 people have benefited from Sharing the Museum since it was launched two decades ago \u2014 a program designed to entice not-your-typical museum goer.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5294717.1569276916!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mmfa-tour-guide.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
