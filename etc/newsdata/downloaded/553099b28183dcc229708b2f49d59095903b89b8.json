Photo: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n\nBen: Who do you think had a really good night tonight?\n\nSarah: Bernie. Warren, too. But Bernie was really impressive tonight. Sharp, clear, consistent.\n\nZak: Agreed. And not long after a heart attack too. You\u2019d have trouble getting me out of bed, let alone subject myself to this.\n\nBen: As others have pointed out, he was slightly toned down \u2013 which made him seem more effective.\n\nZak: I was never that put off my his ranting granddad vibe, but it\u2019s true that toning things down made his arguments seem less like insistent diatribes and more like reasonable presentations of common sense ideas, at least superficially.\n\nSarah: Bernie\u2019s tone never bothered me, to be honest. I never found him to be particularly shouty and in any case, his unvarnished affect seems to be part of his appeal. So my takeaway isn\u2019t really that Bernie succeeded because he toned it down. His answers were tight, his comments were critical when they needed to be, and ably defended his policies from attack.\n\nZak: And I\u2019ll echo Sarah on Warren\u2019s good night. She weathered the attention that comes with being the frontrunner way more smoothly and graciously than Biden. Less rattled, better able to lucidly stay on message, and never seemed to take anything personally.\n\nBen: Unlike in some past debates, the central target of the also-rans wasn\u2019t Joe Biden, but the newly appointed frontrunner, Warren. In an early exchange, she once again did not say whether she would raise taxes to fund Medicare for All, earning some criticism from Pete Buttigieg and others. Did this, or any of the other attacks against her, draw any blood?\n\nZak: I think her refusal to answer that question on those particular terms is a reasonable gamble. It risks her coming off as evasive, but I think pushing people to think more about overall costs vs just taxes is a net positive and has the potential to shift the terms of the discussion in a way that helps her cause. Plus the accusation themselves just aren\u2019t that meaty. We know what her answer is going to be, and at a certain point it starts feeling like the people to whom it\u2019s most scandalous are the reporters who insist on asking it knowing what the answer will be.\n\nSarah: I\u2019d like for her to develop a more detailed answer on Medicare for All but overall I think she handled herself well. She\u2019s made her wealth tax such a centerpiece of her campaign that the typical \u2018but-how-will-you-pay-for-it\u2019 line that always gets lobbed at left-wing candidates falls a little flat. One other thing I appreciate about Warren (and Sanders, for that matter) is that she has little patience for gotcha questions, and I think that trait\u2019s been useful to her in the debates.\n\nBen: Pete Buttigieg was considerably more combative in this debate than in previous affairs. He challenged Elizabeth Warren directly on her refusal to say she\u2019d raise taxes with her health care plan. He told Beto O\u2019Rourke that \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage\u201d during an exchange on gun laws. In an effort to break into the top tier, he\u2019s positioning himself as a moderate who will not hesitate to criticize those to his left. Is this working for him or coming off as arrogant? Or something in between?\n\nZak: There\u2019s always something so incongruous to me about being extremely combative in defense of moderation. It\u2019s especially off-brand for Buttigieg because we\u2019ve come to expect this pragmatic level-headedness and desire to stay above the fray and discourage in-fighting and all of a sudden he\u2019s scolding everybody.\n\nSarah: It didn\u2019t work for him. Look, Sanders and Warren have a clear message. Everyone knows who they are and what they represent. It\u2019s difficult to say the same of Buttigieg. His alternative to Medicare for All sounds like a joke people would make on Twitter, and the I\u2019m-just-a-sensible-man-from-the-heartland routine is a bit rich coming from a Harvard-educated Rhodes scholar whose father was a Marxist professor at the University of Notre Dame. When Buttigieg speaks, I don\u2019t hear anything that resembles the concerns of actual voters; I hear a wonk. And while that\u2019s partly because I\u2019m a socialist, and have different politics, I don\u2019t think Buttigieg\u2019s smarm is entirely a figment of my imagination.\n\nAnd I agree with Zak. I think the notion of a pugnacious moderate is a bit of contradiction in terms.\n\nBen: Why didn\u2019t anyone (or almost anyone) attack Joe Biden? It seems that people have crowned warren as the obvious frontrunner \u2013 but he\u2019s still doing very well in national polls and many state polls, too.\n\nZak: Probably reserved about the broader implications of fueling Trump\u2019s attacks. There seems to be a tacit agreement among Democrats not to admit openly that the Hunter business is shady, paired with a willingness to take a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach to how it affects Biden\u2019s campaign moving forward.\n\nSarah: Trump\u2019s complicated that a bit by going after Hunter. I actually think there\u2019s plenty to criticize about Hunter\u2019s business dealings, and would\u2019ve liked to see someone press Biden on the cronyism, but nobody wants to look as if they\u2019re aligned with Trump. I think, too, that candidates do recognize that Biden has a healthy base of support, and they\u2019re wary of alienating those voters. Perhaps they think that Biden will self-immolate, given enough time.\n\nBen: That has been the conventional wisdom with him for a while and it keeps not happening \u2013 though he has faded a bit in recent weeks.\n\nSarah: Yes, and I think that\u2019s due partly to his performance in the debates. He\u2019s incoherent much of the time.\n\nBen: What\u2019s up with Kamala Harris? She went from dominating the first debate to having an extended exchange where she tried to \u201cgotcha\u201d Elizabeth Warren by accusing her of not being on board with banning President Trump from Twitter. That was weird.\n\nZak: I think she isn\u2019t sure what she stands for and is throwing a lot of different things at the wall to see what sticks.\n\nSarah: I don\u2019t think she really knows why she\u2019s running for president?\n\nBen: We\u2019ve all been there.\n\nSarah: Haha.\n\nBen: Any other candidates you thought shone or did the opposite of that?\n\nSarah: Why was Tom Steyer on stage? I mean, I know why, but he has no business being there.\n\nBen: He did not talk much.\n\nSarah: Right, and when he did talk, he did not do himself any favors.\n\nZak: Tom Steyer was like the amalgamation of every white man who\u2019s dropped out so far.Plus Howard Schultz. I like to think they all just jumped into the same body and put it on a plane to Ohio.\n\nSarah: This is a terrible Transformers movie\n\nZak: I was gonna say I pitched this as a Being John Malkovich sequel. No takers so far, but I\u2019m shopping it.\n\nBen: Haha.\n\nWhat was the most glaring absence in terms of topics? Gotta be climate, right?\n\n\ufeffZak: I think so, especially in the wake of the strikes and UN testimonies\n\n\ufeffSarah: Climate, yes. But housing too. Kind of shocking that we\u2019ve yet to get a single question about the housing crisis\n\nBen: Lastly, we\u2019ve all noticed that the debates don\u2019t tend to change the underlying dynamics/numbers of the race all that much. Is there anything about this one that people will remember and that will really make an impression?\n\nSarah: No.\n\nZak: Nope\n\nBen: So that\u2019s a yes?\n\nZak: That\u2019s a no, Ben.", "description": "In the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate, Intelligencer staffers discuss the attacks on Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris\u2019s strange Twitter moment, and why nobody attacked Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Zak Cheney-Rice", "Benjamin Hart", "Sarah Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/08/23/23-biden.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
