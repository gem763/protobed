Los Angeles will have right-hander Walker Buehler on the mound Wednesday night, hopeful he can repeat his masterful performance from the first game of this series, when he pitched six scoreless innings and surrendered just one hit. The Dodgers won 59 games at Dodger Stadium this season, the second most for any home team in the majors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt would\u2019ve been great to finish that off here,\u201d center fielder Cody Bellinger said. \u201cBut at home with Buehler going, I like our chances.\u201d\n\nFor as successful as the Dodgers have been in the postseason, reaching the past two World Series, there remains what utility player Kike Hern\u00e1ndez referred to as \u201cunfinished business.\u201d After they lost to the Houston Astros in 2017, they slogged through the next season just to return to that stage and fall short again, to the Boston Red Sox. The defeat could have crushed them in either instance, but they instead channeled it into trying to give it another go this season, winning the NL West by 21 games \u2014 the largest margin in division history.\n\n\u201cIt tells you what those guys in that clubhouse, what our mentality is,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to rest until we finally bring a world championship back to Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Game 5, the Dodgers will look to get the main ingredient they were missing Monday night \u2014 strong starting pitching. Roberts tabbed 39-year-old Rich Hill for Game 4 after he\u2019d played in just 13 games for the Dodgers this season \u2014 he missed 12 weeks with a flexor tendon strain in his pitching elbow and then injured his knee in the first inning of his return. Hill had pitched just 5\u2154 innings since June.\n\nHis night ended after he walked Nationals left fielder Juan Soto to load the bases with two outs in the third, allowing one run with two hits and four walks. Hill\u2019s short stint was expected, but the Dodgers had hoped he could at least get through the fourth inning, so Los Angeles turned to a collection of relievers after him \u2014 five to be exact. The only pitcher Roberts deemed unavailable (other than Game 3 starter Hyun-Jin Ryu) was Buehler, saved for the possibility of a Game 5.\n\n\u201cI think that the curveball was up all night and the finish wasn\u2019t quite there,\u201d Roberts said of Hill. \u201cTo finish three innings and to be knotted up at 1 was a good spot for us with six innings to play.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Roberts\u2019s \u201cbullpenning\u201d approach was foiled with the Nationals\u2019 four-run fifth inning. With lefty Julio Ur\u00edas on the mound, Trea Turner\u2019s leadoff single to left started the rally, and then Anthony Rendon\u2019s line drive to center brought Turner home. The Dodgers yanked Ur\u00edas after Howie Kendrick\u2019s hit, bringing in right-hander Pedro B\u00e1ez to face Ryan Zimmerman. B\u00e1ez \u2019s second pitch was a 97-mph fastball that Zimmerman crushed for a three-run home run, lifting Washington to a 5-1 lead that wasn\u2019t relinquished.\n\nThe pressure is arguably on Los Angeles now, to win in front of its fans and to have this October finally be the one that ends with a title. It\u2019s something the Dodgers didn\u2019t seem too daunted by Monday night.\n\n\u201cWell, I guess this will be kind of my third of those scenarios, so something I\u2019m familiar with,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cGetting to do it at home certainly helps, and there\u2019s not a lot to it. We\u2019ve got to win a game, and if we don\u2019t, we go home.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nMax Scherzer is Max Scherzer again, and the Nationals\u2019 season lives because of it\n\nRyan Zimmerman blasts Nationals past Dodgers, 6-1, to force Game 5 in L.A.\n\nMax Scherzer explains the pressure athletes are under at all times\n\nThe Dodgers believed the Nationals would turn to Patrick Corbin in relief, and adjusted\n\nAD", "description": "It\u2019s a scenario they\u2019ve been in before and are comfortable with, specifically against Washington.", "authors": ["Isabelle Khurshudyan", "Reporter Covering The Washington Capitals"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vh8hvodVsriFpzHTJLLlHF2K_Ps=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2FXFSFHJPUI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
