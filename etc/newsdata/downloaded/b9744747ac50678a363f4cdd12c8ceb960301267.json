REUTERS/Yara Nardi/File Photo\n\nThe three-week synod opens on Sunday at a time when the region - made up of eight countries and the French territory of Guiana - is in the world spotlight because of recent devastating fires in Brazil.\n\nAbout 260 participants, mostly bishops from the Amazon, will discuss spreading the faith, protection of the environment, climate change, deforestation, indigenous people and their right to keep their land and traditions.\n\nThe Church\u2019s small but vociferous hardline conservative wing has drawn up battle lines.\n\nDespite being led by only three cardinals among some 230 in the Church and just one bishop out of more than 5,000, they have parlayed their savvy use of social media and their access to conservative Catholic news outlets to pillory the synod\u2019s working document.\n\nThey say it is bursting with doctrinal errors, including what they say is an implicit recognition of forms of paganism and pantheism practised by indigenous people, such as nature worship. Many of the conservative hardliners are also sceptical about climate change science.\n\nLast week, about 200 conservatives gathered near the Vatican and prayed silently \u201cwith the purpose of forming a united army against the enemies of God and of the Church\u201d, they said in a statement.\n\nThe synod will be \u201ca battle between good angels and demons\u201d, one participant said.\n\nGerman Cardinal Walter Brandmueller wrote that the synod could mark \u201cthe self-destruction of the Church or its transformation from the mystical body of Christ into a secular NGO with an ecological-social-psychological mandate\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat do ecology, economy and politics have to do with the mandate and mission of the Church?\u201d he asked.\n\nPlenty, answered Pope Francis\u2019 defenders. They have rejected conservative criticisms that the Church should concentrate on saving souls and not get involved in issues such as climate change and social and economic injustice.\n\nDIGNITY FOR ALL\n\n\u201cEvery Christian has a prophetic commitment to justice, peace and dignity for every human being,\u201d said Peruvian Cardinal Pedro Barreto Jimeno, vice president of REPAM, a grouping of the Catholic communities in the Amazon.\n\nBarreto said this included protecting people and the environment from the excesses of a \u201cdominant model of society that leads to exclusion and inequality\u201d.\n\nWhile Francis\u2019 defence of the environment has been widely praised, including by the United Nations, conservatives, mainly in the United States, have attacked him. Many are aligned with conservative news outlets and well-funded political foundations sceptical of climate change science.\n\nConservatives are also angry with Francis over other issues, such as a more welcoming attitude towards homosexuals and moves to allow Catholics who have divorced and remarried outside the Church to receive communion.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that there is a political battle going on in the Church today,\u201d said Father Arturo Sosa, the Venezuelan head of the Jesuit order to which Francis belongs.\n\nSosa said the attacks are a way of \u201ctrying to influence the election of the next pope\u201d by destabilising Francis\u2019 papacy so cardinals picking his successor after his death or resignation lean towards a conservative who won\u2019t rock the boat so much.\n\nOne of the synod\u2019s contentious topics is whether to allow older married \u201cproven men\u201d with families and a strong standing in local communities to be ordained as priests in the Amazon.\n\nThis solution to the shortage of priests, backed by many South American bishops, would allow Catholics in isolated areas to attend Mass and receive the sacraments more regularly.\n\nAt least 85% of Amazon villages cannot celebrate Mass every week. Some see a priest only once a year.\n\nOpponents of the change, even only on a regional basis, fear it would be a doctrinal Trojan horse.\n\nHERESY\n\nU.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke, de-facto spiritual guru for many of the pope\u2019s critics, said the shortage of priests in the Amazon was a \u201cpretext\u201d that would lead to \u201cthe practical abolition of priestly celibacy\u201d in the rest of the world.\n\nBurke and Bishop Athanasius Schneider of Kazakhstan issued an appeal for \u201ca crusade of prayer and fasting to implore God that error and heresy do not pervert\u201d the synod.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe pope\u2019s backers point out that the Church in the West already has a small number of married priests and say the fears are exaggerated.\n\nThey say there was little or no criticism when Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, both revered by conservatives, ushered in changes that allow married Anglican clergymen who convert to Catholicism to continue to serve as priests.\n\nThe synod does not make decisions. Participants vote on a final document and the pope will decide which recommendations to integrate into his future rulings.", "description": "An assembly of bishops to discuss the future of the Roman Catholic Church in the Amazon, including the possibility of introducing married priests, has deepened faultlines between Pope Francis and conservatives who say it is heretical.", "authors": ["Philip Pullella", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436257578&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9112C"}
