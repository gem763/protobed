Fitbit, meanwhile, has been stepping up its smartwatch features with its Versa line, which does not use Wear OS.\n\nAcquiring Fitbit would also fit into Google\u2019s overall hardware strategy, now that it is building its own phones and other devices. In early 2018, it also closed its acquisition of large parts of HTC\u2019s design division. We\u2019ve also seen numerous rumors about Google building a Pixel smartwatch over the years. So far, it has not released its own first-party watch, though.\n\nFitbit\u2019s stock shot up almost 30% after the first rumors surfaced. In recent months, the company\u2019s stock often traded below $3, down from close to $48 shortly after its IPO in 2015. Today, after the announcement, it went up to around $5.20.", "description": "According to Reuters, Google parent Alphabet is looking to acquire publicly traded wearables company Fitbit.
