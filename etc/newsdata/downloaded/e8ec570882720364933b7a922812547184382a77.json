REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe plan would increase the Japanese firm\u2019s initially planned investment of $1.5 billion in WeWork as part of the agreement, giving the U.S. company the right to receive the money in April next year in exchange for Class A common stock.\n\nSoftBank and its Saudi-backed Vision Fund are WeWork\u2019s biggest backers and have already funneled more than $10 billon into the U.S. company, including the promised $1.5 billion.\n\nThe potential new investment from SoftBank could unlock more financing options for WeWork, which is in talks for a $3 billion to $4 billion loan from a consortium of banks contingent on it raising additional capital, FT added.\n\nA new deal would reduce the price per share at which SoftBank acquires WeWork stock, giving it a larger stake in the unprofitable property group, FT said on Wednesday, citing people briefed on the matter. It was unclear how renegotiations would affect the Japanese group\u2019s valuation of its investment, FT said.\n\nWeWork declined to comment on the report. SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSoftBank invested in WeWork parent We Company at a $47 billion valuation in January, but investor skepticism led to a potential IPO valuation of as low as $10 billion earlier this month, Reuters reported.\n\nThe startup postponed its IPO last week, and on Tuesday, its co-founder Adam Neumann resigned as CEO, giving up the majority of his voting control after SoftBank and other shareholders turned on him.\n\nWeWork appointed two insiders as co-CEOs and said Neumann will stay on the board as non-executive chairman.\n\nWe Company said it is evaluating the \u201coptimal timing\u201d for an IPO.\n\nMORE MONEY\n\nIn the run-up to the planned IPO, investors questioned WeWork\u2019s corporate governance standards, as well as the sustainability of its business model, which relies on a mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue.\n\nThe lowered valuation is a blow to SoftBank as it tries to amass $108 billion for its second Vision Fund. Reuters sources said it was likely that SoftBank would have to pony up more cash to support its biggest bet, or take a writedown in case of an IPO.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s stock is down 8% since the beginning of this month.\n\nThe renegotiation of the warrant agreement is one of several options being considered, FT said.\n\nThe talks are in early stages and SoftBank, led by billionaire Masayoshi Son, could decide against investing altogether, the business daily said.", "description": "SoftBank Group Corp is planning to pump an extra $1 billion or more into WeWork by renegotiating a warrant agreement struck before falling valuations delayed the U.S. office-sharing startup's IPO, the Financial Times reported.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1433989076&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P00R", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
