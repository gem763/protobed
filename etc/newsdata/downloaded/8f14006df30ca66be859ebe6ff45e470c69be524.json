The president\u2019s critics have said the actual purpose of the investigation is to discredit legitimate findings about Russian meddling in the 2016 election and the numerous contacts between Moscow and the Trump campaign. These critics also have accused Barr of acting as Trump\u2019s lawyer rather than in the national interest.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said he would leave the investigation to Barr and the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll see things that nobody would have believed. This was the worst hoax in the history of our country,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe designation that it has become a criminal investigation gives Durham, the top federal prosecutor in Connecticut, authority to convene a grand jury to assess evidence and compel testimony from witnesses - a process commonly used before criminal charges are filed in the U.S. legal system.\n\nThe person who spoke with Reuters on Thursday declined to say whether a grand jury had been set up.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that it will end in an indictment. It just means there is enough to take it to the next level,\u201d said Channing Phillips, who served as the top federal prosecutor in the District of Columbia under Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Attorney General William Barr participates in a presentation ceremony of the Medal of Valor and heroic commendations to civilians and police officers who responded to mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S. September 9, 2019.

Other likely targets who are now no longer in government service, such as former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI agent Peter Strzok, previously told Reuters through representatives or attorneys they had not been contacted.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s former No. 2 official, Andrew McCabe, said investigators did not act improperly.\n\n\u201cYou had a room full of career government officials with a very serious responsibility of investigating threats to national security, and that\u2019s exactly what we did,\u201d McCabe said on CNN.\n\nMcCabe is one of several former U.S. officials who have come under scrutiny. He was fired by the Trump administration in 2018, hours before he was due to retire, after the Justice Department\u2019s internal watchdog found he had misled investigators about his actions in 2016. McCabe\u2019s lawyer has called it an honest mistake.\n\nTop Justice Department officials approved a criminal case against him in August, but charges have not been filed.\n\nTrump has alleged that U.S. officials hostile to him launched the 2016 investigation, which was eventually taken over by Mueller after the president fired FBI Director James Comey in 2017, to undermine his chances of winning the White House, although he and his supporters have provided no evidence.\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation, which found that Moscow engaged in a campaign of hacking and propaganda to boost Trump\u2019s 2016 candidacy, led to the criminal convictions of several former campaign aides. But Mueller concluded that he did not have sufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nThe Democratic chairmen of the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees expressed concern that Barr has turned the Justice Department into \u201ca vehicle for President Trump\u2019s political revenge.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Trump hosts a presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony for Roger Penske at the White House in Washington , U.S., October 24, 2019.
