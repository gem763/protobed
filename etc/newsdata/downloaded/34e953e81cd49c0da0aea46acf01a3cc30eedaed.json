The suspect, 27-year-old German Stephan Balliet, filmed the assault and streamed it online.\n\nThe victims, reportedly a German man and woman, appeared to be chosen at random when the assailant failed to gain access to the temple he had besieged with gunfire and homemade explosives, as the frightened congregation barricaded itself inside.\n\nThe rampage was streamed live for 35 minutes on Twitch, and eventually seen by some 2,200 people, the online platform said, in a chilling reminder of the mosque attack in Christchurch, New Zealand in March which was also played out online in real-time.\n\nPolice subsequently captured the Halle suspect after a gun battle that left him wounded.\n\nMerkel told a trade union convention that the German state and civil society must do everything in their power to stand up to \"hate, violence and contempt for human life\".\n\n\"There must be zero tolerance,\" she said.\n\nLate Wednesday, Merkel joined a solidarity vigil at a historic Berlin synagogue, and firmly condemned the anti-Semitic rampage.\n\nPresident Frank-Walter Steinmeier, joined by Israeli ambassador Jeremy Issacharoff and local officials, laid flowers Thursday at the Halle temple before meeting Jewish community representatives inside.\n\nHe later told reporters that the country had a duty to protect Jews on its soil, also in light of its historical guilt for the Holocaust.\n\n\"It must be clear that the state takes responsibility for Jewish life, for the security of Jewish life in Germany,\" he said.\n\nFederal prosecutor Peter Frank said Balliet would be charged with two counts of murder and nine counts of attempted murder in what he called a \"terror\" act that had been planned to be a \"massacre\".\n\nBalliet had packed four kilogrammes (nine pounds) of explosives in his car, and \"wanted to enter the synagogue to kill many people,\" added Frank.\n\n- 'Action not words' -\n\nBut Jewish leaders said that words were not enough, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joining calls for Germany to \"act resolutely\" against anti-Semitism.\n\nThe head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany ripped into the authorities for failing to provide adequate security on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar.\n\n\"It is scandalous that the synagogue in Halle is not protected by police on a holiday like Yom Kippur,\" said Josef Schuster.\n\n\"This negligence has now been bitterly repaid.\"\n\nGermany has taken pride in the rebirth of Jewish life since the Nazis' World War II slaughter of six million Jews across Europe.\n\nThe community has grown to about 225,000 thanks in large part to an influx from the ex-Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nWithout mentioning the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) by name, Merkel and Steinmeier condemned xenophobic rhetoric they said had grown increasingly mainstream and dangerous.\n\nAfD parliamentary group leader Alice Weidel pushed back, saying critics were \"exploiting this horrible crime to defame their political rivals with baseless defamation\".\n\n- 'Saw through the camera' -\n\nIn a copy of a 35-minute video obtained by AFP the gunman filmed himself launching into a diatribe against women and Jews and denying the Holocaust, before carrying out the attack.\n\nThe gunman also published an anti-Semitic \"manifesto\" online more than a week ago, according to SITE monitoring group director Rita Katz, who said the document showed pictures of the weapons and ammunition he used.\n\nHalle Jewish community leader Max Privorotzki told the Stuttgarter Zeitung of the harrowing minutes as the synagogue came under assault with 70 to 80 people inside.\n\n\"We barricaded our doors from inside and waited for the police,\" he said. \"Then we carried on with our service.\"\n\n- 'Failure', 'loser' -\n\nAmong those in the synagogue were 10 Americans, as well as several Israelis, who had turned up in Halle especially to join the small local population in celebrating Yom Kippur.\n\n\"We've made it out with our lives, in health and amazing spirits,\" wrote Rebecca Blady, a Jewish American community leader, who was in the synagogue.", "description": "Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed Thursday there would be \"zero tolerance\" for hate in Germany after an attempted massacre at a synagogue, as Jews demanded action to protect the community from the rising threat of neo-Nazi violence.
