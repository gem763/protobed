The House Intelligence Committee released the seven-page document, which was directed to the heads of the House and Senate Intelligence committees, on Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cThis interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President\u2019s main domestic political rivals. The President\u2019s personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph W. Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General [William P.] Barr appears to be involved as well,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nIn that phone call, Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, one of his chief political rivals, and Biden\u2019s son Hunter \u2014 offering to enlist Barr\u2019s help in that effort while dangling a possible visit to the White House, according to a rough transcript of the call released by the White House on Wednesday.\n\n[Trump offered Ukrainian president Justice Dept. help in an investigation of Biden, memo shows]\n\nA spokeswoman for Barr has said that he did not know about the phone call until the whistleblower issue was raised, and that he had not spoken with Trump about assisting Ukraine with an investigation of Biden or his son.\n\nThe unidentified intelligence official was so alarmed by the conversation, and related interactions between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials, that the official filed a whistleblower complaint to the inspector general for the U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nWhile the whistleblower\u2019s primary concern is the president\u2019s phone call with Zelensky, it is clear from the document that its author also was troubled by what appeared then to be a four-month pattern of election season misconduct involving the president, his lawyer, and White House aides who sought to keep the whole thing quiet.\n\n\u201cI am also concerned that these actions pose risks to U.S. national security and undermine the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to deter and counter foreign interference in U.S. elections,\u201d the person wrote.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the whistleblower was not alone in harboring concerns about the nature of Trump\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cThe White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThey told me there was already a \u2018discussion ongoing\u2019 with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials\u2019 retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.\u201d\n\nAbout a dozen White House officials listened in on the call, which is commonplace when heads of state speak directly. The complaint identifies State Department official T. Ulrich Brechbuhl as one of the officials who listened to the call.\n\nThe alarm was so great, the complaint says, that White House officials sought to limit access to the written record of the call.\n\n\u201cIn the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to \u2018lock down\u2019 all records of the phone call, especially the word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced \u2014 as is customary \u2014 by the White House Situation Room,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThis set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower goes on to say that they were told by unidentified White House officials that they had been directed by White House lawyers \u201cto remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored.\u201d\n\nThe complaint also describes a series of alleged actions by Giuliani that seemed designed to pressure the Ukraine government to go after Joe Biden \u2014 a chief political rival to the president who is currently seeking the Democratic nomination to run against Trump in 2020.\n\nThe whistleblower said that they learned from other U.S. officials that Giuliani\u2019s visit to Madrid on Aug. 2 to meet with a Zelensky aide was \u201ca direct followup\u201d to Trump\u2019s July 25 call to the Ukrainian president and request for an investigation of the Bidens. Giuliani also reached out to \u201ca variety of other Zelenskyy advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s account is based on months of conversations with colleagues and concedes that, for most of the events described, the whistleblower was not a direct witness. The whistleblower wrote that the information was gathered \u201cin the course of official interagency business. It is routine for U.S. officials with responsibility for a particular regional or functional portfolio to share such information with one another to inform policymaking and analysis.\u201d\n\nThe complaint, filed in August, became the subject of a high stakes back-and-forth among government agencies about how it should be handled. While the inspector general sought to alert Congress to the concern, lawyers at the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel concluded it should not be shared with Congress. The Justice Department decided it was not a proper whistleblower complaint, because it involved the conduct of the president, who is not an employee of the intelligence agencies.\n\nInstead, the complaint was relayed to the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division in late August as a possible violation of campaign finance laws. After reviewing the matter for several weeks, Justice Department officials concluded the law had not been broken and closed the matter without ever opening a formal investigation.\n\nKaroun Demirjian contributed to this report.", "description": "The complaint, made by an unidentified intelligence official, was made after Trump\u2019s July phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.", "authors": ["Devlin Barrett", "Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Law Enforcement", "Carol D.
