Kerching!\"\n\nThe Telegraph said the sketch was \"one of the highlights\" of the programme. \"Yes, depressingly, our fixation with the tackiest of reality shows has spread across the Atlantic.\"\n\nVulture said the segment \"hits all the right notes\", while IndieWire described it as \"especially good\".\n\nWaller-Bridge appeared in the sketch alongside US cast members of Saturday Night Live, who tackled British and Irish accents.\n\nVanity Fair said it \"mostly made fun of accents that were neither English nor Irish, but were so strange that even the other contestants couldn't understand one another.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @eliovsb I never really cared that Phoebe Waller Bridge is posh until she used her SNL spot to mock the mostly working class people who appear on #LoveIsland as though the thing that is most amusing about Love Island is that the people on it are crass and ignorant (not true). \u2014 Elio (@eliovsb) October 6, 2019 Report\n\nSaturday's programme also saw Waller-Bridge appear in sketches about the royal family, a TV news bulletin, a game show and a bar. \"The other sketches in the show were an absolute disaster,\" Vanity Fair said.\n\nWaller-Bridge's presence \"only served to highlight the material that wasn't up to her level\", the magazine's critic Jordan Hoffman wrote.", "description": "Fleabag star appears in savage skit of the UK reality show on Saturday Night Live in the US.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/262C/production/_109127790_pwb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
