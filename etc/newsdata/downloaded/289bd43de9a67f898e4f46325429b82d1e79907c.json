Same-store sales fell 2.9% while ecommerce sales were also down,\n\nThe company blamed a cocktail of problems including poor trading due to Brexit uncertainty, heavy discounting from trouble rivals and shoppers increasingly buying online. Unseasonably warm weather last month added insult to injury.\n\nChief executive Lindsay Page said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got the macroeconomic and political things that are going on that are affecting consumer confidence here, in mainland Europe and the US. And that challenge to demand has led to levels of discounting certainly in this country that we\u2019ve not seen before \u2013 some brands are going on sale at the launch of their new collections.\u201d\n\nCold weather in North America and Europe also hit trading: \u201cWe probably went a bit too summery a bit too early but we addressed that quickly,\u201d said Page.\n\nHe refused to comment on Kelvin\u2019s rumoured potential offer.\n\nSome analysts remained confident this wasn\u2019t the onset of a terminal decline at Ted Baker.\n\nLiberum analyst Adam Tomlinson said: \u201cThere has been an unprecedented level of discounting, consumer confidence remains low and other fashion players are fighting for their lives, so the fact that Ted Baker has found things tough is not surprising.\n\n\"Underlying the fall in profit, the group has done a good job in clearing excess stock, which has impacted margins in the first half, and it has bought well for the rest of the year. It remains a strong brand with international opportunity, which means it\u2019s better placed than many to ride things out.\u201d", "description": "Ted Baker founder Ray Kelvin saw his paper fortune crumble today as the retailer he left after its Hug-gate scandal slumped into the red.Shares in the quirky fashion brand plunged 36% or 333p to 592p as it posted grim first-half results, wiping \u00a352 million of the paper value of Kelvin\u2019s stake.", "authors": ["Alex Lawson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tv4x5ctJXSAOPDPb6MUWDA--~B/aD0zMjQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/36c154651ca2120b8b91685ffa818be3", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
