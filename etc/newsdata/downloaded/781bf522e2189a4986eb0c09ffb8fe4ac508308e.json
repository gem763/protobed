Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nWhile American States Water's 1.3% dividend yield is not the highest, we think its lengthy payment history is quite interesting. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying American States Water for its dividend, and we'll go through these below.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nNYSE:AWR Historical Dividend Yield, October 15th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 53% of American States Water's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a fairly normal payout ratio among most businesses. It allows a higher dividend to be paid to shareholders, but does limit the capital retained in the business - which could be good or bad.\n\nIn addition to comparing dividends against profits, we should inspect whether the company generated enough cash to pay its dividend. Last year, American States Water paid a dividend while reporting negative free cash flow. While there may be an explanation, we think this behaviour is generally not sustainable.\n\nIs American States Water's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs American States Water has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). American States Water has net debt of 2.97 times its EBITDA. Using debt can accelerate business growth, but also increases the risks.\n\nWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. American States Water has EBIT of 5.97 times its interest expense, which we think is adequate.\n\nWe update our data on American States Water every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of American States Water's dividend payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.50 in 2009, compared to US$1.22 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 9.3% per year over this time.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Today we'll take a closer look at American States Water Company (NYSE:AWR) from a dividend investor's perspective...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aRU2y.RBXxOqhlyGX4jPMQ--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/91217209f4f46094d9480fb9fcfb198b", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
