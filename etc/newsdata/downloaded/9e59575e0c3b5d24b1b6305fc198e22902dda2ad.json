And Tom Brady was not a unanimous choice. USA TODAY\n\nJim Brown is No. 4 on the USA TODAY Sports list of the top all-time NFL players, but he\u2019s not No. 4 on mine. In fact, he\u2019s not on my list at all.\n\nI didn\u2019t forget about him. Quite the opposite actually. As one of the 19 voters on the panel who determined the list, I thought long and hard about what to do with Brown, whom many consider the greatest NFL player ever, with statistics that include 12,312 rushing yards and 106 touchdowns, both records when he retired after the 1965 season.\n\nBut if Jim Brown were playing today, he wouldn\u2019t be playing at all. In the post-Ray Rice NFL, he would have long since been kicked out of the league.\n\nJim Brown had 12,312 rushing yards and 106 touchdowns, both records when he retired after the 1965 season.

Take a look at these from USA TODAY Sports' archives:\n\nIn 1965, an 18-year-old woman accused Brown of forcing her to have sex after giving her alcohol, but a jury found him innocent of assault and battery in a 10-day trial.\n\nIn 1968, Brown was accused of throwing a woman from a balcony, but when the 22-year-old refused to name Brown as her assailant, the charge of assault with intent to murder was dropped.\n\nTOP 100: The greatest NFL players of all time\n\nIn 1969, Brown was acquitted of assaulting a man after a traffic accident.\n\nIn 1971, charges that Brown battered two women were dropped after they failed to testify at his trial.\n\nIn 1978, Brown was fined $500 and jailed for a day for beating up a fellow golfer in an argument over the placement of a golf ball.\n\nIn 1985, Brown was charged with rape, sexual battery and assault, but the charges were dropped when the 33-year-old woman gave inconsistent testimony.\n\nIn 1986, Brown was arrested for allegedly beating his girlfriend after accusing her of flirting. He spent three hours in jail, but three days later the 21-year-old woman said she didn't want to prosecute.\n\nIn 1999, Brown was convicted in Los Angeles of smashing the window of his 25-year-old wife\u2019s car but was acquitted of making terrorist threats against her. The judge sentenced him to three years' probation, stripped him of his driver's license for a year and ordered him to attend counseling for domestic abusers.\n\nWe want to honor this man? I have another idea. How about shunning him forever?\n\nWith two exceptions, Brown, now 83, got off on all of these arrests or accusations, most of them allegations of violence against women. A Brown apologist might say that since there were so few convictions, all these terrible things might not have happened. Perhaps all these alleged victims just made all this up, eh?\n\nJERRY RICE: Jim Brown is the greatest player in NFL history\n\nThat\u2019s what current-day Brown supporters must think. Otherwise, how in the world can you justify honoring this man in any way at all in the NFL\u2019s 100th year?\n\nLook at the dates of these allegations: the 1960s, '70s and '80s, mostly. We\u2019ve learned quite a bit over the past two years in the #MeToo era about how these kinds of cases were handled by the authorities back then. If you were a big shot, you often got away with it.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that the great Jim Brown, who went on to a career in Hollywood after his NFL days were over, was not convicted of anything, time and again, during those years. (Of course, Rice was not convicted for punching his then-fiance Janay Palmer, but his career still was over. Convictions are not necessary to end abusers\u2019 NFL careers.)\n\nForevermore, NFL history will tell the story of Brown\u2019s stellar career with the Cleveland Browns. He can keep all his statistics and records. No one is taking that away.\n\nBut honor him now? Glorify him at this moment in our history, with all that we have learned about the abuse of women?\n\nShame on us.", "description": "Some consider Jim Brown to be the greatest player in the NFL's 100-year history, but his criminal record cannot be overlooked.", "authors": ["Christine Brennan", "Published A.M.
