Andrella\u2019s two young daughters, Niyah and Sky, were not in car seats and weren\u2019t strapped into seat belts either, CNN reports.\n\nWhen Kevin asked the single mom of three why her daughters weren\u2019t in car seats, Andrella told him she couldn\u2019t afford them at the time.\n\n\u201cWith bills coming up and winter coming up, I got to get coats and boots and shoes and stuff, so it was kind of hard for me,\u201d she told local media.\n\nKevin, who has children of his own, said he felt compassion for Andrella\u2019s situation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a father myself, I have three kids,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought of my kids jumping around. What if a car hit them and they flew and got seriously hurt, if not killed?\u201d\n\nKevin not only let Andrella go without fining her, he also went to a local Walmart and purchased car seats for the two young children, even afterwards helping Andrella install them.\n\nThe Milwaukee Police Department thanked Kevin on Facebook for going beyond his call of duty.\n\nSources: People, CNN, Facebook", "description": "A police officer is being praised for his kindness after he pulled over a single mom and, instead of fining her, drove her to Walmart to buy some car seats.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9510/9518f00d47754e1a98ce5af98ba3da30.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
