However, that has happened in previous cases.\n\nIranian TV said that the Australian judiciary had planned to send Dehbashi to the U.S. but that he was released through Tehran's diplomatic efforts.\n\nThe couple spent almost three months in Tehran's notorious Evin prison after they were arrested for flying a drone near a military zone without a license.\n\nBefore their arrest, they had been globe-trotting for two years and documenting their travels on Instagram and YouTube.\n\nThey requested privacy as they seek to \"get back to (their) normal lives.\"\n\n\"We know there are others who remain in detention in Iran, including a fellow Australian, and believe intense media coverage may not be helpful for efforts to bring them home,\" they said.\n\nForeign Minister Marise Payne said the government continued to seek the return of a third Australian, Melbourne University lecturer Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who has been in detention since October 2018.\n\nPayne described her situation as \"very complex.\"\n\n\"She has been detained for some considerable time, and has faced the Iranian legal system and has been convicted and sentenced,\" Payne said, adding the government did not accept the spying charges against her.", "description": "In a possible swap, an Australian-British blogger and her fianc\u00e9 returned home Saturday after being freed from a three-month detention in Iran.
