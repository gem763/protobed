What I did was wrong.\n\n\u201cBeing a footballer and someone who young fans look up to I know the example I set is key. I am ashamed. At 23 I am old enough, and I was brought up, to know better.\n\n\u201cI understand that such actions have serious consequences. I take full responsibility for my actions and accept the punishment that the club has issued.\n\n\u201cI have to and will learn from these events and will strive to be a better person.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m sorry to my family, my friends, the club, all Derby supporters and to the wider football community, I let you all down.\u201d", "description": "The Rams' forward is due to appear in magistrates court along with teammate Mason Bennett on October 15", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Matt West Bpi Rex", "Derbyshire Constabulary"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20465724.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Burton-Albion-v-Derby-County-Pre-Season-Friendly-Pirelli-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
