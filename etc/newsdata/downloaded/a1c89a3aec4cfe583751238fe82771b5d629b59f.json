Add Interest\n\nThe statement, released late Wednesday, was an unusual step by lawyers Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid who have been reluctant to provide any information that might identify their client. The person is protected from retaliation under anti-corruption laws, but Trump has said he has the right to meet his accuser.\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\n\"The Whistleblower has ties to one of my DEMOCRAT OPPONENTS,\" Trump tweeted on Wednesday. \"Why does the ICIG allow this scam to continue?\n\nThe whistleblower's lawyers say that is not true.\n\n\"Our client has spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the Executive Branch,\" the lawyers stated.\n\nWhile the lawyers' statement did not address the following issues directly, the person has previously been identified as an intelligence official and a registered Democrat.
