Trump supposedly threatened to withhold military aid unless Zelensky opened a corruption probe against Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden. The whistleblower is reportedly a CIA agent, a registered Democrat, and worked with a 2020 Democratic candidate. There is also a third citation indicating political bias that was not revealed. That portion was redacted. But the report is second-hand sourced and riddled with errors because this person didn\u2019t listen in on the call. The Trump White House also released the transcript, which totally debunked the quid pro quo aspect of this circus.\n\nThe complaint wasn\u2019t released to members of Congress prior to them announcing a formal impeachment inquiry. Yeah, no one read the complaint, so that\u2019s all you need to know about Democratic intentions in this matter. This is an attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election, using a biased intelligence operative who had worked with Joe Biden during the Obama presidency. Yeah, that was revealed today by The Washington Examiner:\n\nThe 2020 Democratic candidate with whom the CIA whistleblower had a \"professional\" tie is Joe Biden, according to intelligence officers and former White House officials. Lawyers for the whistleblower said he had worked only \"in the executive branch.\" The Washington Examiner has established that he is a career CIA analyst who was detailed to the National Security Council at the White House and has since left. On Sept. 26, the New York Times reported that he was a CIA officer. On Oct. 4, the newspaper added that he \"was detailed to the National Security Council at one point.\" Michael Atkinson, the Intelligence Community's inspector general, told members of Congress that the whistleblower had a \"professional tie\" to a 2020 Democratic candidate. He had written earlier that while the whistleblower's complaint was credible, he had shown \"some indicia of an arguable political bias ... in favor of a rival political candidate.\" A retired CIA officer told the Washington Examiner: \u201cFrom everything we know about the whistleblower and his work in the executive branch then, there is absolutely no doubt he would have been working with Biden when he was vice president.\" As an experienced CIA official on the NSC with the deep knowledge of Ukraine that he demonstrated in his complaint, it is probable that the whistleblower briefed Biden and likely that he accompanied him on Air Force Two during at least one of the six visits the 2020 candidate made to the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we also learned today that both Joe and Hunter Biden were paid by Burisma Group, the Ukrainian energy company at the center of all the questions concerning their working relationship with the former vice president and his son. Hunter was on the board being paid tens of thousands of dollars a month, despite having zero experience in the energy sector. The allegation is that he was there selling access and the Biden campaign has yet to fully address this working relationship. The former vice president insists that he never discussed overseas work with Hunter. That\u2019s never going to hold up. There\u2019s that picture of the former VP and Hunter golfing with Ukrainian energy executives; they never discussed overseas work. Who are you kidding? And now with Biden revealed to have been paid $900,000 for his lobbying efforts on behalf of Burisma, this Ukraine tie will remain a topic of discussion.", "description": ".10/10/2019 20:14:19PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/276/8be9d20b-6f41-4341-8dc9-4312049fbc0f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
