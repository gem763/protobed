Sulk wants. Sulk must have. Jennifer Arcuri had driven him mad by insisting he stick to Google Hangouts when he\u2019d been dying to move on to spreadsheets. But today of all days he had been certain nothing could spoil his triumph. He\u2019d looked the EU in the eye and he had blinked first. It took some skill to go back to Brussels and negotiate an even worse withdrawal agreement than Theresa May, but somehow \u2013 against all the odds \u2013 he had defied the gloomsters and pulled it off.\n\nSo this was to have been his Super Saturday. A day to go down in the history books, when parliament met for the first time on a weekend in 37 years and he, the World King, would be carried aloft along the Tory benches as the \u201cMan who Delivered Brexit\u201d. OK, it would almost certainly be a short-lived triumph once everyone realised that he\u2019d promised polar opposites to different groups of MPs and the real arguments would only emerge once the UK had left the EU, but he could live with that. He wasn\u2019t a man used to taking responsibility for the long-term consequences of his actions.\n\nBoris Johnson leads his weary people to the unpromised land Read more\n\nInstead this turned out to be Not-So-Much Saturday. All thanks to Oliver Letwin, who had wanted to give the Commons more time to examine the legislation and to prevent the UK crashing out with a no-deal Brexit on 31 October if the ERG chose to play dirty. Typical boring Girly Swot. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m Boris,\u201d he had said and to his astonishment 322 other MPs had decided they didn\u2019t. Though the real philosophical impossibility had been that 306 reckoned they could. Yet again, Brexit continues to make fools of fools. But the result was still the same. Boris denied. His exquisite petite mort had turned into a dispiriting grande mort.\n\nThe Sulk did what the Sulk does. He sulked. OK, he\u2019d almost certainly get his deal in the end, but he didn\u2019t want to wait. He wanted to go back to Downing Street to play back clips of \u201cHis Finest Hour\u201d. If not the country\u2019s finest hour. But now he was going to be locked back into a Groundhog Day of having to explain why his shit deal wasn\u2019t shit. It just wasn\u2019t fair.\n\n\u201cPifflepafflewifflewaffle,\u201d he mumbled sulkily. Kevin the Teenager had behaved more gracefully. He wasn\u2019t going to say if he was going to write a letter to the EU asking for an extension. He might. There again he might not. But if he did, he\u2019d do it later. Much later. At the very last minute. \u201cDEEr DoNAld, I aM rRITing vis leTTa coz I HavE bin made 2, wiv NO luv. BoRIs.\u201d Classic Boris. Classic Dom. Clearly the pair were made for each other. Combined they have an emotional age of nine and three-quarters.\n\nProceedings had begun with the prime minister making a statement to the Commons. It was his deal and when he\u2019d said there would be no border down the Irish Sea what he had meant was that there wouldn\u2019t be any badgers in wetsuits conducting underwater checks. Instead the badgers would be surrounding Liverpool in night-vision goggles. Besides what better way was there of expressing our commitment to the European cause than by telling the EU to sod off? It wasn\u2019t you, he had told Michel, it\u2019s me. I\u2019ve got commitment problems.\n\nJeremy Corbyn\u2019s reply had been typically drab. The words come out in the right order but his heart never appears to be in what he\u2019s saying. All passion spent. It\u2019s as if what he\u2019s reading out is a total surprise to him. Maybe it is. The only other highlights of the session were John Baron insisting both that he had never been a member of the ERG and that he had stopped being a member of the ERG, while insisting that his excitement the previous day over the deregulation of workers\u2019 rights had been a total aberration. Arise Baron Baron. Where would the country be without idiots like him?\n\nThe debate proper also mostly lived down to expectations. No cabinet minister has worked harder to make himself more forgettably average than Steve Barclay and he appeared thrilled that every word he said lost its meaning long before it had escaped his lips. His most compelling argument for not publishing the impact assessments which showed the UK would be 6.9% worse off under the new deal was that Classic Dom had some stats which proved everyone would be 7.9% happier to be 6.9% poorer. Truly the country is screwed.\n\nMarch organisers hail \u2018one of the greatest protest marches in British history\u2019 Read more\n\nNot for the first time, by far the best speech came from the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer. Mainly because he is about the only person in the Commons who really understands this stuff. And cares about it. He tore through the hypocrisies and deceits in the bill and laid bare the almost inevitability of crashing out with no deal in December 2020 as agreeing a new trade deal in little more than six months was nigh on impossible.\n\nThereafter things fell apart. Theresa May proved you can never lose what you don\u2019t have. She is the presence that feels like an absence. It also turned out that things she could never countenance as prime minister she is more than happy to suck up as a backbencher. She\u2019s at her best when she says nothing at all.\n\nFittingly, Chris Grayling provided the day\u2019s nadir. Cheek wobbling uncontrollably \u2013 the nervous tic that\u2019s the only giveaway for signs of intelligence that may lurk within \u2013 he begged Letwin to withdraw his amendment. Tories pleaded with Failing Grayling to sit down \u2013 every time he speaks he loses votes \u2013 but the damage was done. Letwin was home and dry.\n\nThe day ended in chaos with Jacob Rees-Mogg having a strop of his own and refusing to tell anyone exactly what business the government had planned for the next week. It might try to have the same vote again on Monday, but there again it might not. There would be votes. Some of which would be Meaningful, others of which would be Deep and Meaningless. A parliament of donkeys, led by nematodes. And not very bright ones at that.", "description": "\u2018Trust me, I\u2019m Boris,\u2019 the PM had said, and to his astonishment 322 MPs decided they didn\u2019t", "authors": ["John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71bc28059a64809186a7794bdfd8ae2301ab0683/0_69_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f3a9fa8bc88e38ad05cee122051835dd", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
