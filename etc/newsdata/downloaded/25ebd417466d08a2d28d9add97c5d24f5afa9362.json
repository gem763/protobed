This skill allowed him to travel great distances at speed, to spread his message of enlightenment. That\u2019s not all his penis could do. It also fired out flames to subdue demons, and he used it to \u201chelp\u201d troubled women (yes, that means what you think it means). It was an all-round wonder tool, a sort of mystical Swiss army knife.\n\nI\u2019m not telling you this to be shocking. I\u2019m telling you this because travelling in Bhutan is so strange, so otherworldly, that stories like this \u2013 which come thick and fast, by the way \u2013 are just a part of being here. Yetis, thunder dragons, flying tigers, floating statues: they\u2019re an added layer, a thread that stitches the mystical world to the everyday.\n\nJust visiting the country has a near-legendary quality, thanks to a clever high-value/low-volume tourism model. Make them pay for the privilege, the thinking goes, and the backpackers and package tours will stay away. For the lucky few that do come, there\u2019s now a new place to stay: Six Senses, which has opened three luxury lodges this year, with two more launching imminently, creating a clever circuit linking the valleys of Paro and Thimphu with tropical Punakha and remote Gangtey and Bumthang.\n\nSix Senses currently has three lodges spread throughout the kingdom, with another two due to open soon More\n\n\u2022 The hottest hotels opening this year\n\nBut back to the monk and his penis. Today, Drukpa Kunley is revered and at his temple, Chimi Lhakhang, I watched a young woman being tapped on the head with a giant wooden penis by a crimson-robed monk \u2013 a blessing for those wanting to conceive. In the village nearby, I wandered past houses painted with big, colourful phalluses, the shops selling penis souvenirs.\n\nTiny, orderly Thimphu felt more anodyne, the buildings whitewashed, the roofs painted green, red or yellow. But the Tashicho Dzong, the capital\u2019s huge 17th-century fortress, seemed hidden and mysterious, like stepping on to an abandoned film set. It is the seat of government and houses the king\u2019s office, but I had the place more or less to myself, strolling across the cobbled courtyards past soaring stone walls and elaborately painted colonnades, just the odd monk hurrying between buildings.\n\nIn the throne room and temple, the colourfully painted ceilings, golden pillars and flickering butter lamps gave weight to my guide\u2019s stories of gracious deities, angry demons and hungry ghosts. She told me how the Je Khenpo, the country\u2019s religious leader, was just the latest reincarnation in a long line of Je Khenpos, how Bhutan is known as the Land of the Thunder Dragon, and that the king is the Dragon King.\n\nKing Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck is hugely popular, perhaps because education and healthcare are free, or because Bhutan is the world\u2019s only carbon negative country, or maybe it\u2019s that gross domestic happiness trumps gross domestic product. Then again, that could just be another story (there is still serious poverty, especially in the more remote valleys).\n\nTashicho Dzong, the capital\u2019s huge 17th-century fortress, is the country's seat of government Credit: getty More\n\nStory continues", "description": "In the 15th century, a Tibetan monk named Drukpa Kunley flew into Bhutan by twirling his penis like the blades of a helicopter.
