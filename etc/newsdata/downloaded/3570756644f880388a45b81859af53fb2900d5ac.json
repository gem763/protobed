Dimon said that the idea behind Libra is not unique and further turned the conversation to his company\u2019s own stablecoin, JPM Coin, revealing that JPMorgan is spending over $11 billion on technological developments this year.\n\nJPM Coin vs. Libra\n\nDimon thus cemented his previous statements about Facebook\u2019s coin, when he claimed that Libra does not pose a threat in the foreseeable future. Dimon specified at the time that \u201cto put it in perspective, we have been talking about blockchain for seven years and very little has happened. We are going to be talking about Libra three years from now.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s native coin has three early applications, according to Umar Farooq, head of the company\u2019s blockchain projects. These are cross-border payments for large corporate clients, which currently rely on wire transfers provided by networks like SWIFT, securities transactions, and usage in JPMorgan\u2019s treasury services business to replace the funds that firms hold in various subsidiaries across the world.\n\nCompanies are leaving Libra over regulatory concerns\n\nOctober saw an array of Libra Association founding members abandon the project, including Visa, eBay, Stripe, Mastercard, PayPal and Booking Holdings.
