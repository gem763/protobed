Volume was higher than usual with over 642,000 shares trading, above the 65-day average volume of 190,589.\n\nShares of the U.K. company fell earlier in the London market after it said revenue from a U.S. segment fell in the first nine months of the year, and warned revenue from U.S. higher-education courseware would decline by between 8% and 12% this year. Previous guidance called for a decline of no more than 5%.\n\nWrite to Stephen Nakrosis at stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 26, 2019 13:00 ET (17:00 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
