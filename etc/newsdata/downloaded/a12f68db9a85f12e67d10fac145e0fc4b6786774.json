Many of the dead in Fukushima were elderly, NHK said.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it, the water came up so fast,\" one man in Fukushima told NHK.\n\nThough the threat of rain is expected to diminish on Tuesday, temperatures are likely to drop in many areas later this week, in some cases to unseasonably low temperatures, NHK said.", "description": "Though the threat of rain from Typhoon Hagibis is expected to diminish on Tuesday, temperatures in Japan are likely to drop in many areas later this week, in some cases to unseasonably low temperatures, NHK said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106181034-1571102306940gettyimages-1180973358.jpeg?v=1571102340", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
