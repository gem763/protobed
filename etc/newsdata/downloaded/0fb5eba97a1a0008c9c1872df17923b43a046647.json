Simple, right?\n\nWRONG:\n\nChaos! LAX banned Uber, Lyft, and taxi pickups at the curb. Here\u2019s how the new system works\u2026 a shuttle ! pic.twitter.com/aaAz73jTro \u2014 Jessica Naziri (@jessicanaziri) October 30, 2019\n\nGood job, everyone:\n\nLAX just banned Uber/Lyft curbside pickups today. THIS is the chaos it\u2019s created.\n\nIt usually takes me 10 minutes to get a curbside ride. Today most of us waited 45 minutes. How is this better?@flyLAXairport pic.twitter.com/cVCpJRXfCV \u2014 Karen Hua (@k_hua) October 29, 2019\n\nIt didn\u2019t get any better as the day turned to night:\n\nMidnight on Weds. Utter chaos. pic.twitter.com/C0baUxJ3Nj \u2014 FERRARI SHEPPARD (@stopbeingfamous) October 30, 2019\n\n\u201cDO NOT TRY\u201d:\n\nDO NOT TRY TO @Uber @lyft or TAXI FROM LAX. The MINIMUM WAIT WILL BE 45 MINS TO 1 HOUR AFTER THE TERMINAL BUS RIDE! @flyLAXairport just found a way to make traffic WORSE! Kudos! pic.twitter.com/nK0lvPE2VQ \u2014 Jet Tila (@jettila) October 30, 2019\n\nThere are plenty of taxis, but those are more expensive than Uber/Lyft:\n\nSo taxis are empty and waiting because they're charging 3 times that of uber and lyft. Stupid, they could charge the same and kill the game. \u2014 FERRARI SHEPPARD (@stopbeingfamous) October 30, 2019\n\nImagine landing. Then waiting for your bags. Then waiting for the shuttle bus. Then waiting for your Uber/Lyft?\n\nAn hour and a half later, finally got an uber from LAX. Smart people walk from the loading zone to the Hyatt and catch rides from there. \u2014 FERRARI SHEPPARD (@stopbeingfamous) October 30, 2019\n\nAnd don\u2019t even think about saving a buck on a shared ride:\n\nThe new LAX rideshare situation is a total disaster, according to multiple frustrated passengers. \u201cOnly way to expedite it is take a shared ride and that still took over an hour.\u201d My friend waited 70 minutes and the person he shared a ride with waited for one hour and 40 minutes. pic.twitter.com/qY8TrFCEKg \u2014 Arash Markazi (@ArashMarkazi) October 30, 2019\n\nSome passengers were left totally in the dark:\n\nUber/Lyft chaos arrives at LAX, and @laura_nelson sticks the landing on the lede. https://t.co/DUx3kKNc2R pic.twitter.com/f70K6YO2Dy \u2014 Matt Pearce \ud83e\udd85 (@mattdpearce) October 30, 2019\n\nKeep this story in mind the next time a Dem says we should give people in California more say in national elections:\n\n@flyLAXairport wasn\u2019t the bad before #LAXit, sure it was busy but I never had to wait more than 10 mins for my @Uber. After a long flight the last thing I want to do is take a bus and wait in line with a ton of bummed out travelers. Come on #lax you blew it. \u2014 Luke Wessman (@LukeWessman) October 30, 2019\n\nLAX, at first, tried to spin the program as a success:\n\nWe have staff on the ground surveying passengers using the new #LAXit today, and so far, everyone has had an \"excellent\" or \"good\" experience! pic.twitter.com/dZLrUEC8uo \u2014 LAX Airport (@flyLAXairport) October 29, 2019\n\nPut they were quickly called out on their BS survey:\n\nThese are the results of the people surveyed at random and there will be kinks to work out, but so far most people seem to like it! \u2014 LAX Airport (@flyLAXairport) October 29, 2019\n\nAnd they later issued an apology and promised to do better:\n\n***", "description": "\"The MINIMUM WAIT WILL BE 45 MINS TO 1 HOUR AFTER THE TERMINAL BUS RIDE!\"", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Am On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-30-at-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
