Steny Hoyer, D-Md., announced last week that the chamber would vote on the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act \u2013 known as the SAFE Banking Act \u2013 which is the less ambitious of two marijuana-related bills congressional leadership had been considering for months. It passed 321-103, with 91 Republicans voting for it and Alabama Rep. Terri Sewell the only Democrat voting against it.\n\nThe legislation faces an uncertain fate in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been reluctant to bring up marijuana-related bills.\n\n\"Thousands of employees, businesses and communities across this country have been forced to deal in piles of cash because of the conflict between state and federal law,\" Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo., a bill sponsor, said after the measure passed Wednesday. \"After six years of working on this bill, the SAFE Banking Act will go a long way in getting cash off our streets and providing certainty so financial institutions can work with cannabis businesses and employees.\"\n\nTEENS, PREGNANT WOMEN URGED NOT TO SMOKE POT BY SURGEON GENERAL: 'THIS AIN'T YOUR MOTHER'S MARIJUANA'\n\nThe SAFE Banking Act would allow cannabis businesses to access financial services that have long been difficult to find due to their gray-area status \u2014 often legal in their individual state but illegal federally. Even cannabis businesses like hemp growers and CBD manufacturers that don't work directly with THC, the intoxicating chemical in marijuana, have struggled to access banking services due to trepidation that still hangs over the industry. Under the bill, marijuana businesses would be able to open accounts, take on loans, accept credit cards and deposit money into banks that now seldom associate with them for fear of repercussions from the federal government.\n\nThose services will be important for a sector that added 64,389 jobs in 2018, according to a report by Leafly and Whitney Economics, and could grow even more as pot laws continue to loosen across the United States.\n\nScott Van Rixel, CEO of Bhang, a company that manufactures CBD candies and licenses THC products to state and provincial license holders, said giving cannabis companies access to general financial services would give the industry an air of stability and help it grow.\n\nYOUNG CHILDREN GETTING THEIR HANDS ON MARIJUANA-INFUSED BROWNIES, GUMMIES IN LEGAL STATES, POISON CONTROL CENTERS SAY\n\n\u201cInvestors are going to have greater faith in the industry with access to traditional banking and the traditional credit card process,\u201d he said. \u201cVendors and business to business are [also] going to be more comfortable if you know they can use standardized wires, standardized banking, write a check, get a wire without fear of reprisal or their bank account getting shut down.\u201d\n\nSafety is an issue, too. Many cannabis companies \u2013 like TILT Holdings, which raked in $39 million in earnings last quarter \u2013 are forced to do their business largely in cash, putting employees at risk of being robbed.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that we do everything possible to protect people working within the industry,\u201d TILT Holdings Chief Operating Officer Tim Conder said.\n\nBut Kevin Sabet, who advised the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations on drug policy, warns that SAFE Banking Act is a corporate giveaway in sheep\u2019s clothing.\n\nCDC SAYS ONE IN 10 MARIJUANA USERS BECOME ADDICTED\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to create another big tobacco and big pharma industry and it never ends well for public health,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cToday\u2019s marijuana is much more harmful than it used to be. It\u2019s not Woodstock weed anymore.\u201d\n\nSabet noted that Altria and Phillip Morris, two of the largest tobacco companies in the world, are invested in marijuana. So are many big alcohol companies.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about social justice at all, this is about enriching for-profit companies,\u201d he said.\n\nSome progressive Democrats say simply letting marijuana businesses work with banks isn\u2019t enough.\n\nAMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT DIVERTED TO DENVER AFTER UNRULY PASSENGER REPORTEDLY SMOKES WEED ON BOARD\n\nThe most comprehensive cannabis bill in Congress right now is the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, known as the MORE Act, which has support from Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Rep. Jerrold Nadler, R-N.Y., among others. The bill, which would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and implement social justice programs for those affected by the \u2018War on Drugs,\u2019 would likely have a more difficult time clearing the Senate and getting President Donald Trump\u2019s signature than the SAFE Banking Act.\n\nLegal-pot activists and progressives had beseeched House members to take up the MORE Act first, worrying Congress would stop with the SAFE Banking Act. In a move to potentially assuage those fears and round up votes for Wednesday, Nadler committed to a markup of the MORE Act Tuesday night.\n\n\"The House is expected to consider the SAFE Banking Act on the floor tomorrow and I will vote for it,\" he said in a statement. \"As the sponsor of the MORE Act, I also strongly support additional marijuana reform....\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSabet is skeptical about the MORE Act, too.\n\n\u201cThis is not going to be an industry that produces social justice. It\u2019s going to be an industry that perpetuates social injustice, as it already is,\u201d he said.", "description": "The\u00a0House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday that provides safe harbor to banks that work with legal marijuana businesses, removing a significant roadblock to growth in the budding cannabis industry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/03/marijuana-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
