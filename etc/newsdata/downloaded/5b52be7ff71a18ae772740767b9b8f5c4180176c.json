(Charles Krupa/AP)\n\nIn a searing and emotional meeting Wednesday, faculty members at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology repeatedly challenged the university\u2019s leadership to ensure that the need for research dollars would not blind the university to its fundamental values.\n\nMIT President L. Rafael Reif opened a faculty meeting with an apology, acknowledging that revelations about the school\u2019s ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had been disorienting to the campus, and deeply distressing to him. \u201cI understand that I have let you down and damaged your trust in me, and that our actions have injured both the Institute\u2019s reputation and the fabric of our community,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYet I also know that MIT\u2019s reputation is firmly rooted in the brilliant work that you and our whole community have been doing, and sharing with the world, for decades, and that you will continue to do.\u201d\n\nSome faculty members responded with tears, and some shouted as they debated the university\u2019s past acceptance of funding from Epstein, who pleaded guilty to two felony offenses in 2008, including procuring a person under 18 for prostitution, and was arrested in July on new federal charges of sexually abusing dozens of girls in the early 2000s.\n\nTo invite him to visit campus, several people said, was a fundamental betrayal of the women of MIT. \u201cHow can MIT\u2019s leadership be trusted when it appears that child prostitution and sex trafficking can be ignored in exchange for a financial contribution?\u201d asked a letter signed by more than 50 female faculty members, challenging the administration to back up its rhetoric about inclusion with action.\n\nIt was the last straw, some said, in an institutional culture that has long undervalued women.\n\nSome faculty members proposed a resolution that would ensure oversight of donations by faculty members, not just administrators, and transparency about the process. The motion to establish a committee to protect academic integrity will be considered at a faculty meeting in October.\n\n\u201cThe values that guide MIT\u2019s faculty, students and staff should never be traded or sacrificed for short term monetary gains or vague promises of future benefit,\u201d the resolution read, in part.\n\nBalakrishnan Rajagopal, an associate professor of law and development who helped write that resolution, said, \u201cMIT needs a lot of internal cleaning up and a fairly significant set of changes to the way it currently operates.\u201d\n\nMIT is not unique, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the ecosystem of large universities entangled with all kinds of unholy money everywhere.\u201d\n\nHe noted the school has tackled difficult issues head-on in the past.\n\nFaculty members met Wednesday at MIT for their regularly scheduled meeting with only one item on the agenda: the Media Lab, a research center that had accepted donations from Epstein and attempted to conceal the extent of its relationship with the sex offender.\n\nBut the issues involve all of MIT, Reif acknowledged. The school has been roiled by resignations and debates after revelations about the close connection between Epstein and MIT. Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Center for Civic Media at MIT and an associate professor of the practice at the Media Lab, announced last month that he had decided to leave the school at the end of the academic year.\n\nZuckerman shared updates from the faculty meeting on social media Wednesday and quoted the president of the student body as saying she was angry, and that students felt they had met their moral tipping point.\n\nHundreds of faculty members filled the room, which was changed this week to accommodate the anticipated crowds.\n\nReif acknowledges that we have a culture problem as well as a process problem. At a time oif growing fortunes and shrinking federal funding, need to look more closely at anon donations, clear set of principles rooted in values. #mitfacultymeeting \u2014 Ethan Zuckerman (@EthanZ) September 18, 2019\n\nAlso need to address cultural pressures that prevented people from speaking out about Epstein. Offers congratulations to people who spoke out about Epstein. PresReif @ #mitfacultymeeting \u2014 Ethan Zuckerman (@EthanZ) September 18, 2019\n\nSome spoke out about the impact of MIT and its research, and called for the institution to look ahead.\n\nA professor defended the fundraising decisions, and asked rhetorically if they should stop the MIT machine.\n\nSome people shouted, \u201cYes!\u201d\n\nMIT has been roiled by news in recent weeks, including a New Yorker report that Joi Ito, the Media Lab director, and colleagues had sought to conceal Epstein\u2019s donations and relationship with the lab. Ito resigned, and university leaders announced an outside law firm would investigate.\n\nLater that week, Reif announced that senior members of his administration were aware of gifts the Media Lab received between 2013 and 2017 from Epstein\u2019s foundations, and that the investigation had turned up a 2012 letter thanking Epstein for a donation to a mechanical engineering professor. The letter was a standard gift acknowledgment signed by Reif in the early weeks of his presidency, according to Goodwin Procter, the law firm the university had hired to investigate.\n\n\u201cMany students have asked how I could have signed that acknowledgment letter without asking questions, and how I could fail to remember it,\u201d Reif said in prepared remarks Wednesday. \u201cThe answer is simple: I did not recognize the name, and I sign many standard thank-you letters every week. That includes several hundred letters every year thanking individuals for contributions to the Institute.\u201d\n\nReif outlined to faculty members some of the steps the administration was taking, such as efforts to review and correct how it assesses donor agreements. But he acknowledged that the fundamental failure at MIT was in its culture.\n\n\u201cI know that many people have deep concerns about sources we have relied on to raise funds for the work of the Institute,\u201d Reif said. In a time of growing fortunes and shrinking federal funds, administrators need to weigh the political, cultural and economic impacts of donors\u2019 behavior, he said, including examining the issues with anonymous giving. People were telling him, he said, that they needed a set of guiding principles.\n\n\u201cThis moment of crisis must be the moment of reckoning,\u201d he said, \u201cand a turn towards real accountability.\u201d", "description": "Some faculty members responded with tears, and some shouted as they debated the university\u2019s past acceptance of funding from the convicted sex offender and financier.", "authors": ["Susan Svrluga", "Reporter Covering Higher Education For The Grade Point Blog", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pQPzMPz1jMzQ6YtCdQD2mk87-1E=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FLXUKDWFXEI6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
