A closely watched index that tracks the health of the industry also showed that manufacturing is in the worst shape since before President Trump took office \u2014 contracting for 2 straight months. The last time the sector contracted was in 2016.\n\nAnd while President Trump has blamed the Federal Reserve for the slump, and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow punted responsibility to Europe, business groups and manufacturers say there's no question Trump's trade war is the real problem.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Judd Deere told Axios: \"The fundamentals of the economy are strong because of this president\u2019s pro-growth policies, and the White House does not see an imminent economic downturn.\"\n\n\"Talks with China are continuing this week, but there is no doubt that President Trump will continue to use every available tool to level the playing field and reduce barriers to the export of our goods and services.\"\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce's chief policy officer Neil Bradley, who has worked closely with the Office of the United States Trade Representative on the Trump administration's pending trade agreements, tells Axios he's been \"concerned about the outlook for the manufacturing sector for some time now.\"\n\n\"When businesses begin to decline, one of the first sectors to be impacted by that is manufacturing,\" Bradley said. \"The next few months are critical. Either confidence [in the markets] is going to be restored, or that lack of confidence from the tariffs will continue to spread. And that's when you risk a recession.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, Jay Timmons, said that optimism among their members is declining \u2014 and the lack of clarity surrounding USMCA and tariffs has put \u201ca chill on business investment decisions\u201d in the sector.\n\nThe bottom line: Counties with local economies that rely on manufacturing overwhelmingly supported Trump in 2016 and celebrated the \"Trump bump\" that accompanied him when he took office.
