It will be housed at Berkeley's School of Law and College of Natural Resources.\n\nNever one to mince words, Brown has been vocal in his post-gubernatorial condemnations of the White House\u2019s ongoing campaign to roll back climate regulations and strip away California\u2019s environmental autonomy.\n\nIn a series of colorful tweets, Brown has assailed the federal government investigating carmakers that made an emissions deal with California as \u201cbureaucratic thuggery\u201d that \u201csmacks of Stalinism\u201d; said \u201cWe need to turn the lights out on\u201d Trump, \u201cpronto\u201d; and responded to the administration weakening the Endangered Species Act by saying President Donald Trump has \u201cdone dumb things, and now you\u2019re doing something utterly dangerous \u2014 unforgivable!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thinks of himself as kind of a potentate, and if the auto companies don\u2019t follow the whim of the potentate, they can be tortured by the forces of justice,\u201d Brown told POLITICO in describing the administration targeting car companies. \u201cSo that\u2019s an abuse of power in addition to being a bad idea.\u201d\n\nTrue to form, Brown turned philosophical when describing his new institute, calling it a \"a holding action in the face of Trump\u2019s continued assault, but also a catalytic function of stimulation.\" He paused an interview to retrieve a book by John Maynard Keynes and relay the economist\u2019s adage that \u201cthe world is governed by little else than the outdated or defunct ideas of economic and social philosophers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not defunct yet, but we\u2019re going to create some ideas that I\u2019m hoping the practical men will be influenced by,\u201d Brown added.\n\nBrown made climate change his personal mission while in office, traveling the world and signing agreements with hundreds of national and subnational governments to work on emissions-reducing policies. His Under 2 Coalition, aimed at keeping emissions below 2 metric tons per capita, now includes 220 governments in 43 countries.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom lauded Brown for his climate activism as he spoke Monday in New York City at the city's annual Climate Week events pegged to the U.N. General Assembly. \u201cThe leadership emanating out of California is also a point of pride,\" Newsom said. \"I\u2019ve never seen it at the level and scale we\u2019ve experienced it in the past five or six years.\"\n\nBrown said the new institute is an outgrowth of his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing in 2017, as well as with Xie and other academics at China's Tsinghua University. Despite the United States' rapidly chilling relations with China on the national level, he said the group would be able to keep the lines of communication open.\n\n\"We\u2019re totally committed to the kinds of open communication that are closing down virtually everywhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cCalifornia, the University of California, China and Beijing together are not chopped liver. We\u2019re somebody. And we\u2019re going to make something happen.\u201d\n\nXie, a former vice chair of China's main economic planning agency, is now head of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at Tsinghua University.\n\nBrown, who became a visiting professor at Berkeley earlier this year, said the institute will have ties to Chinese national and provincial governments as well as California agencies, including the California Public Utilities Commission, Air Resources Board and the California Independent System Operator.", "description": "Brown said the new institute is an outgrowth of his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing in 2017.", "authors": ["Debra Kahn", "Jeremy B.
