Advocating for clean energy.\n\n\u201cCostly,\u201d a 30-second spot funded by the group\u2019s Club for Growth Action super PAC arm, is a highly misleading attack against Dan McCready, the Democratic nominee in September\u2019s special election in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District. The ad notes that McCready both owns a solar energy business and once served on the board of a group that advocated for clean energy policies.\n\n\u201cHow greedy is Dan McCready?\u201d the spot\u2019s narrator asks. \u201cA tax-exempt special interest group McCready helped run pumped $450,000 into lobbying for costly state energy regulations that benefited McCready\u2019s own business. Then, McCready handed you the bill. The cost to consumers here: $149 million a year in higher energy costs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it is not unusual, illegal, or outside of any ethical norms for businesses and business leaders to support policies that benefit them, the Club for Growth and its long list of adjectives aim to make this seem scandalous.\n\nThe biggest issue with the ad is its dishonest sourcing. While making the claim that North Carolina\u2019s clean energy regulations cost consumers $149 million annually, a small caption on the screen gives a citation to an article in the conservative Washington Examiner. But the article does not actually say that. Instead, its author noted: \u201cCritics of the North Carolina renewable energy law claim the mandate could cost consumers up to $149 million per year in extra fees, while supporters of the law say it has created clean energy jobs and the actual consumer impact of the policy has been minimal so far.\u201d\n\nAnd who are those \u201ccritics?\u201d The Examiner story cites a 2017 study that estimated that if rates rose 2.2% for residential customers due to an increased renewable energy standard, that would be the annual result. The study was done by professors at a Koch-funded Utah State University think tank and it\u2019s off-campus Strata Policy.\n\nIn a statement to the Examiner, a McCready spokesperson said, \u201cAs a Marine and small business owner, Dan is proud of the role he played in making North Carolina the second in the nation for solar power, having helped build 36 solar farms that put 700 North Carolinians to work in good-paying jobs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThrough their company and large web of tax-exempt special interest groups, Charles and David Koch funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to promote climate denial and to elect candidates who oppose regulations on fossil fuel refineries like the ones they own.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1144024150.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1"}
