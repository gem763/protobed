We\u2019re consulting with our allies. And the president will determine the best course of action in the days ahead,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cBut I promise you, under President Donald Trump, America will maintain our energy dominance, we will maintain our momentum toward energy independence. And the United States of America will take whatever action is necessary to defend our country, our troops, and our allies in the Gulf. You can count on it.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence said recent steps to increase domestic energy production have insulated the U.S. against the oil-price shocks created by Saturday\u2019s drone attacks against Saudi production.\n\nSenate Energy Committee Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski echoed the vice president in condemning the attacks and hailing U.S.\u2019s growing ability to absorb ripples in oil supply.\n\n\u201cWhile the details and impacts are still publicly emerging, it is clear our intelligence and national security teams have a lot of work to do, in concert with our partners in the region,\u201d Ms. Murkowski said. \u201cThis is a difficult situation, that\u2019s putting it mildly, but as I look to where we are today, I think we also recognize that the impact that we are seeing could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese attacks,\u201d she said, \u201care a reminder that there is no substitute for American energy production, which has grown into a stabilizing force for world markets.\u201d\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the attack was a twin assault on Saudi Arabia and the global economy, so the perpetrators must suffer consequences.\n\nHowever, he also faulted the Trump administration, saying its \u201clack of a clear, consistent policy on Iran, on the Middle East generally and on international security continues to create instability rather than stability.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile this action has no justification, it occurred within that context,\u201d he said. \u201cThe administration must articulate and put into place a coherent, credible policy dealing with Iran, the Middle East and global insecurity.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, said now it not the time for partisan wrangling. He said both sides need to pass critical spending bills to ensure military readiness in the face of Iran and other threats.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s violent aggression highlights the need for vigilance and for strength,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this is needlessly more difficult if we don\u2019t do our job and fund the military\u2019s modernization and readiness.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
