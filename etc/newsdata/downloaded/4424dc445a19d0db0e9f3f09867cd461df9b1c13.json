Initially, it was hyped to destroy the Trump campaign, then it was promoted to destroy the Trump administration.\n\nThe problem with this media campaign was there was never any evidence of Donald Trump colluding with the Russians. The main document cited as so-called proof was the unverified, \u201csalacious\u201d Steele dossier, compiled by a former British spy with assistance from Russian sources, and funded by the Clinton campaign.\n\nThis political document should have been dismissed as a joke. Instead, it was used to obtain FISA warrants to spy on the Trump campaign and the new administration. Despite no evidence of any wrongdoing, a Special Counsel was hired and given almost $40 million and two years to assemble a team of partisan Democratic investigators to discover \u201cRussian collusion.\u201d Even this biased group of attorneys, led by Robert Mueller, a veteran of the Deep State, made a definitive conclusion that neither the president nor his campaign colluded with Russia.\n\nThe Mueller Report should have ended the hysteria and closed an unfortunate chapter in American history. Instead, the liberal media never stopped promoting the false story. It has been part of their continuing effort to destroy President Donald Trump, both personally and professionally.\n\nSadly, our current national news media is severely infected by a dangerous disease known as Trump Derangement Syndrome. In fact, their condition is so dire that it has destroyed any shred of credibility that was left in the media.\n\nThe latest outrage occurred this week on MSNBC when faux journalist Lawrence O\u2019Donnell breathlessly reported that the president may have had loan documents co-signed by dreaded \u201cRussian oligarchs.\u201d Supposedly, one source convinced O\u2019Donnell to move forward with the story on his national cable show. It was never verified and, as usual, just like the Steele dossier, it was fabricated.\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyers demanded a retraction and on his next show O\u2019Donnell had to respond to the growing criticism for hyping a fictitious story. Laughably, O\u2019Donnell said that the story did not \u201cgo through our rigorous verification and standards practice.\u201d If MSNBC had any \u201cverification and standards practice\u201d half of their unhinged Trump stories would never air on their poor excuse of a cable news network. Eventually, O\u2019Donnell apologized and said that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have reported it and I was wrong to discuss it on the air.\u201d\n\nThis lame apology did not satisfy Eric Trump, the president\u2019s son. He called the story a \u201creckless attempt to slander our family and smear a great company.\u201d Trump said that the company would be \u201ctaking legal action\u201d and that such \u201cunethical behavior has to stop.\u201d\n\nIt is a good step for Eric Trump to move forward with legal action as it may serve to dissuade other liberal media outlets from promoting false stories with the sole purpose of harming the president and his family. O\u2019Donnell and too many of his liberal media colleagues regularly report Trump related stories with little or no verification.\n\nIn this case, O\u2019Donnell promoted the story based on a \u201csingle source close to Deutsche Bank.\u201d The source claimed that the president needed the Russians to co-sign for his loan. Well, O\u2019Donnell inflated that claim to make a ludicrous statement. He said that \u201cif true that would explain every kind word Donald Trump has ever said about Russia and Vladimir Putin.\u201d\n\nThe United States and Russia need to have a working relationship for a variety of reasons, including vital national security. It is smart policy for our nation for President Trump to have regular dialogue with Vladimir Putin. This rationale is always dismissed by liberal media outlets, such as MSNBC, which believe every action President Trump takes toward Russia is a sign that he is hopelessly compromised.\n\nRegarding this absurd story, it was vigorously denied by President Trump. He tweeted that it was \u201cTotally false, as is virtually everything else he, and much of the rest of the LameStream Media, has said about me for years.\u201d\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham lambasted O\u2019Donnell and MSNBC noting that it is \u201cone of the reasons a majority of Americans have lost trust in the media.\u201d According to Grisham, \u201cInstead of applying ethics and standards to their reporting, journalists and left-wing outlets have weaponized the media, using it to attack and harass people with little to no regard for the truth.\u201d\n\nRegarding this instance of journalistic malpractice, O\u2019Donnell will neither be fired nor suffer any negative consequences for getting a major story wrong and slandering the President of the United States. It shows how real journalism has disappeared in this country and journalistic credibility has never been lower.\n\nIt is little wonder that in a recent Gallup poll there are only two professions that Americans rated lower than journalists: car salespeople and Members of Congress. It is an embarrassing ranking that is well deserved for media professionals who are failing in their attempt to destroy President Trump but are succeeding in destroying journalism.", "description": "For over three years, the liberal media, especially MSNBC, have .09/02/2019 3:20:52AM EST.", "authors": ["Jeff Crouere", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/152/5a1a700a-58d1-4903-a43e-58d2eb4a3ab1.jpg"}
