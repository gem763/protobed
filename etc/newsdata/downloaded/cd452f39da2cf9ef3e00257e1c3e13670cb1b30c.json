The universal basic income program, which Yang calls the Freedom Dividend, is his flagship campaign proposal.\n\n\"It's time to trust ourselves more than our politicians,\" Yang said. \"My campaign will now give a Freedom Dividend of $12,000 per year to 10 families. This is how we will get our country working for us again, the American people.\"\n\nYang argues that the Freedom Dividend would not only help ameliorate economic inequality but would reward unpaid work like childcare and housework, boost innovation by providing entrepreneurs with more leeway to start new businesses, and give everyday workers more leverage to demand better working conditions from their employers.\n\nYang, a former entrepreneur, is the main candidate in the race sounding the alarm about the effects of automation on the American economy, particularly how it could eliminate jobs in the trucking and retail sectors.\n\nBeyond the Freedom Dividend, Yang also advocates for other progressive policies and expansive social programs including a single-payer Medicare for All healthcare system, free community college, and nationwide marijuana legalization.\n\nRead more:Andrew Yang is running for president in 2020.
