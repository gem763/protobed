Despite the high police presence, Maryam says they \u201ctried to be nice\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey offered us cold drinks and watermelon, it was a big surprise for us\u201d.\n\nAli Rabiei, Iranian Minister of Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare on Twitter praised, the \u201cquiet\u201d, \u201corderly\u201d women and girls seated in the Azadi (meaning freedom in Persian) Stadium. He added: \u201cI am glad we are at liberty\u201d.\n\nBut, has freedom really arrived at Azadi Stadium?\n\nLast month international attention was garnered by the self-immolation of Sahar Khodayari outside a Tehran court.\n\nIran\u2019s so-called Blue Girl, in reference to her favourite team Esteghlal FC\u2019s colours, had been awaiting sentencing for attempting to sneak into a game disguised as a man.\n\nThe story mobilised football teams to support Iranian women\u2019s cause and prompted FIFA President Gianni Infantino to call for Iran to let women attend the forthcoming qualifier game.\n\nThough Iranian government Minister Ali Rabiei was swift to highlight in a tweet: \"The entry of women into the stadium is the result of internal efforts, not external pressure.\"\n\nThis has been a hard fight for a right that is not prescribed against in Iranian law.\n\nMansoureh Mills, Amnesty International\u2019s Iran Researcher, told Euronews: \u201cThere is no legislation in place, though since 1981 whilst it hasn\u2019t been written into law, the practice has been strictly enforced by Iranian authorities.\n\n\"They make all kinds of excuses - primarily they don\u2019t want men and women to mix, foul language and poor behaviour are all cited as reasons for the ban.\"\n\nMany believe the external pressure hasn\u2019t been mounted and responsibility has been floated namely by FIFA.\n\nOpenStadiums founder Sara told Euronews of her encounter with Infantino last year.\n\n\u201cI told him this is our daily life, women are being interrogated and imprisoned, just for being advocates for this cause, you should be acting as fast as you can.\"\n\nAmnesty International\u2019s MENA Advocacy Director Philip Luther similarly believes the reaction has been too slow.\n\n\u2018FIFA has reiterated its position that women should be permitted to enter football stadiums for all matches, and that\u2019s important but the fact that it\u2019s reiterated this message means it\u2019s been made before. And our concern is that it hasn\u2019t followed up rigorously enough behind the scenes.\n\n\"It does have the power to force the Iranian authorities to comply with that instruction, to date Iran hasn\u2019t moved. The eyes of the world are on now Iran.\"\n\nIndeed the international coverage of the game could not shy away from the glaringly empty stalls in the stadium.\n\nUsing the hashtag #WakeUpFIFA Iranian football fans tweeted screenshots of the 80,000 capacity stadium\u2019s ticketing webpage.\n\nMaryam recalls, \u201cAt the beginning, they allocated less than 2% of tickets to women, the sections A6 -A9 were dedicated to women\u201d.\n\nThough on the day \u201cmany didn\u2019t have tickets, they opened some of the doors to them, and another section of 800. But anyhow it wasn\u2019t enough - though the stadium was almost empty there were less than 3000 men in the stadium and they didn\u2019t sell more to women.\"\n\nIn a statement to Euronews, FIFA\u2019s spokesperson confirmed: \u201cthe number of women in the stadium needs to be determined by the demand for such tickets, without any arbitrary limitation being imposed\u201d.\n\nThey promised details on next steps will follow an assessment of the qualifier game in conjunction with FIFA\u2019s delegation in Tehran.\n\nLuther labelled the qualifier game a \u201ccynical publicity stunt and show\u201d, though the experience is hard won and extremely momentous for Iranian women experiencing daily restrictions in their freedom.\n\nMasih Alinejad, a US-based Iranian activist and founder of White Wednesdays anti-hijab law protest, tweeted: \"Today, I had tears in my eyes as my fellow female compatriots in Iran were in stadiums for the first time.\"\n\nShe called on both \"domestic activism\" and \"international pressure\" to \"help Iranians achieve their civil rights\".\n\nSpeaking of Iran\u2019s 14 - 0 victory, Maryam tells Euronews,\n\n\u201cWe take it as good luck from women\u2019s presence in the stadium. I hope our first presence won\u2019t be our last one, and Iranian women will be able to watch all matches.\"", "description": "Social and international news coverage was awash with women\u2019s faces daubed in green and red face paint and proudly holding Iranian flags aloft.", "authors": ["Helena Skinner"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/39/64/1000x563_cmsv2_d6ffcff5-9367-5ab6-b5e7-bc195574ecca-4223964.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
