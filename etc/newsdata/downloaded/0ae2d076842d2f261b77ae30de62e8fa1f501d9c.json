The Fox TV broadcast stuck to baseball.", "language": "en", "text": "But when President Trump was shown on the video board between the third and fourth innings, the game produced a newsworthy event, both inside sports and beyond. The home crowd booed lustily. In some pockets of Nationals Park, chants of \u201cLock him up\u201d were heard.\n\nThe moment immediately trended on Twitter, national news outlets rushed to publish stories about the incident and by Monday morning the hosts of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d were among those chastising fans for their behavior.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nViewers at home watching Fox\u2019s telecast, though, did not hear about the boos when the broadcast returned from a commercial break, with one of the biggest stories of the night instead spreading across social media and news before landing on cable news shows.\n\nFox showed President Trump ahead of the third inning, when the camera panned to his party. \u201cIt\u2019s the World Series,\u201d Fox play-by-play announcer Joe Buck said. \u201cThe president and first lady of the United States, Donald J. Trump and Melania Trump, are here at the game tonight in their suite. Wounded Warriors joining them for the festivities here at Nationals Park.\u201d\n\nShould Fox have broadcast or otherwise noted the reaction given to Trump?\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s news, which makes it a dereliction of duty not to show it,\u201d said Kevin Robbins, the associate director of the Center for Sports Communication and Media at the University of Texas. \u201cThis isn\u2019t political. It\u2019s not whether you agree with it. It\u2019s just telling you what happened.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe complications of showing the moment are several-fold. The boos happened while the broadcast was on a commercial break, which meant the broadcast would have been showing a replay or commenting not in real time. Then, of course, there are the polarized politics of the moment, particularly when Trump is involved.\n\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re obligated to show the president, then you\u2019re obligated to show the crowd reaction,\u201d Robbins said.\n\nAD\n\nThat was not a unanimous opinion. J.A. Adande, the director of sports journalism at Northwestern and a former reporter at The Washington Post and ESPN, said to hold a telecast to the standards of journalism was unfair.\n\n\u201cWhen they showed the president earlier in the broadcast, do they have to mention he\u2019s the subject of an impeachment inquiry?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think the phrase \u2018stick to sports\u2019 is loathsome, but a broadcast isn\u2019t journalism. When you\u2019re broadcasting the World Series, you\u2019re doing it as a partner of baseball. I think it is important to remember that. You\u2019re not there as a representative of the news division of your network.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe added, \u201cIf there were protests outside the stadium against Trump, I think that goes in the Metro section of The Washington Post. It\u2019s a separate story.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFox declined to comment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you want Fox to do,\u201d said Andy Billings, the director of the University of Alabama\u2019s program in sports communication. \u201cPeople are going to have different perspectives on the prevalence of cheers to boos. Asking a broadcaster to gauge that on the spot is very difficult.\u201d\n\nMichael Weisman, a former lead producer for Fox baseball coverage who also formerly led NBC\u2019s Olympics coverage, said he thought Fox handled the moment correctly, noting the desire of sports broadcasts to avoid third-rail issues such as politics and religion.\n\n\u201cAnytime you\u2019re dealing with politicians, it\u2019s very sensitive,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they picking their nose? Are they eating a hot dog? Everyone\u2019s got an opinion. Fox was lucky the boos happened during a commercial break because if it happened during the game you have to explain the boos to the audience. But once it was at commercial, I don\u2019t think you have to go back to it.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWeisman noted that the Fox World Series broadcast in 2001, which he was a part of, hosted then-New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in the broadcast booth in the month after 9/11. \u201cIf there is a unifying event, then you might want it,\u201d Weisman said. \u201cBut is the whole country behind Trump?\u201d\n\nIn addition to the boos aimed at Trump, an \u201cImpeach Trump\u201d sign was unfurled in the outfield, and behind home plate two people briefly held up \u201cVeterans for Impeachment\u201d signage, which could be seen on the broadcast.\n\nThat sort of activism at stadiums hasn\u2019t been limited to the World Series. An in-stadium cameraman at Staples Center during a Los Angeles Clippers game recently panned to a dancing child who pulled out a \u201cStand with Hong Kong\u201d T-shirt when he was shown on the scoreboard. The camera quickly moved away from the fan.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe news value point is legitimate,\u201d Weisman said. \u201cThere\u2019s no hard and fast rule. But where politics is right now, of course they didn\u2019t want to get involved.\u201d\n\nRead more World Series coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "President Trump got booed during a World Series commercial break.
