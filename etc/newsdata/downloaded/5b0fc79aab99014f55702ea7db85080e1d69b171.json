It has seemed inevitable that commissions would head towards zero, so why wait.\u201d\n\nShares of online brokerages were pummeled for a second day including Charles Schwab (SCHW), E*Trade Financial (ETFC) and Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR). TD Ameritrade (AMTD) took the biggest hit, sliding another 3% after Tuesday\u2019s 26% drubbing.\n\nAlexis Christoforous is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d Follow her on Twitter @AlexisTVNews.", "description": "It\u2019s the herd mentality at work in the online brokerage industry.", "authors": ["Alexis Christoforous"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HQvdVukgWxVWOdCvzuZb4g--~B/aD0yNjI0O3c9MzkzNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/fdff8f20-e527-11e9-baff-9ec56bf3e129"}
