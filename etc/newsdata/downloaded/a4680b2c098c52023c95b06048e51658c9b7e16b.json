To beat the heat, bears spent more time than usual lounging, which may have cut into their time foraging for food. And Alaska\u2019s salmon, a favorite bear treat, were found dead along rivers and streams before getting upstream far enough to spawn.\n\n200 miles of river. Dead chum consistently along entire stretch. None had spawned. 850 counted, many more missed. Likely ruled out mining, disease/parasites. All signs point to heat stress. Sad to see.

The bears have a lot of online human fans who can vote for their favorite bear on Facebook. The winner in the culmination of the tournament today will be a testament to the bears\u2019 ability to adapt in a warming world, experts say, but many brown bears aren\u2019t faring as well. And it could be too early to tell whether the salmons\u2019 struggles to spawn this year could mean less seafood dinners for the bears in the future.\n\nNaomi Boak, a Katmai Conservancy media ranger behind the Fat Bear Week campaign, tells The Verge that the bears struggled with the soaring temperatures, too. \u201cImagine being in 90 degrees, being really fat, and having a big fur coat,\u201d Boak says. \u201cThis is not pleasant.\u201d A fat bear\u2019s surface-to-volume ratio alone can make it harder for the bear to cool itself down.\n\n\u201cImagine being in 90 degrees, being really fat, and having a big fur coat.\u201d\n\nSalmon that survived the heat spent more time out in the ocean and in deeper, cooler water, keeping the bears waiting. \u201cI\u2019ve been out there before, when a [salmon] run was delayed by a week, and the bears start getting anxious,\u201d says Joy Erlenbach, a PhD candidate at Washington State University\u2019s Bear Center, who has studied the bears in the park. \u201cIt\u2019s scary for the bears because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. They just know the food they expect isn\u2019t there, and it can affect their behavior.\u201d\n\nThere could also be cascading effects if the salmon prove to have been less successful spawning this year. \u201cIf this affects the salmon return in years to come or we continue to see significant events that cause a decrease in salmon spawning, then it could lead to a decrease in that food source for bears,\u201d says Katmai wildlife biologist Leslie Skora.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that the heat and salmon shortage would spell doom for the bears \u2014 they\u2019re consummate omnivores, after all. That may make it easier for them to adapt to a warming world, even if it means chasing down the occasional stolen gallon of ice cream. This year was a strong year for cranberries in the park, Skora says.\n\nErlenbach worries that fans of the Katmai competition might not realize the threats that face Alaska\u2019s bears. Katmai is one of the best places in the world for a bear to find a meal, especially for the lucky ones who get to catch salmon along the Brooks River. So if it\u2019s getting tougher here, that doesn\u2019t bode well for less fortunate bears. \u201cThe top 20 fattest bears in the world are the ones that are getting the press right now,\u201d she says. The skinniest bears \u2014 the ones we should worry about \u2014 aren\u2019t.", "description": "Despite the online excitement about Katmai National Park\u2019s fat bears this year, the critters struggled harder than usual to plump up.
