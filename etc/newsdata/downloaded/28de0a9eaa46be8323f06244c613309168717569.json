We would also point out that publicly-traded IWG is bigger, more profitable, and has a market capitalization lower than $4B.\u201d", "description": "\"This segment of the economy is likely to be particularly susceptible to an economic downturn,\" Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/03/0/0/546429-wework-common-area.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
