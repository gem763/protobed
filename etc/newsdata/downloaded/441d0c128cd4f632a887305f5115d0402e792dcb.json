Instead, he glows. So when we made this film about his fascinating life, we didn\u2019t want it to be sad. Keeth isn\u2019t sad.\n\nThis film got its start after Luther moved to New York for college, where he started fencing with Keeth through the Peter Westbrook Foundation, which supports some of the best fencers in the country. After Luther\u2019s fencing career concluded, he turned to video and began collecting the stories of his Peter Westbrook Foundation teammates. When Keeth and his sister Erinn gave us the personal archive of tapes that trace their family\u2019s unlikely path to the Olympics, we were transfixed by their raw intimacy. We decided to animate the rest of his story; with animator Aaron Brewer, we designed our illustrations to match the aesthetic of the archival material. Because we decided to construct the film around Keeth\u2019s narration, we built the film like a music album, drawing more artistic cues from Frank Ocean\u2019s Blonde than from any documentary film.\n\nWe aspired to make a final product that is as wholly representative of Keeth and his outlook on life. We hope that everyone else is as inspired by him as we are.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
