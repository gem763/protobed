Jeremy Corbyn's silent treatment for Boris Johnson ahead of Queen's Speech", "language": "en", "text": "It is a day of full-on pomp and ceremony in the Palace of Westminster with age-old traditions whose origins are in the medieval past.\n\nBut the State Opening of Parliament saw Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn engage in one of the newer political traditions today - the awkward silent walk to the Lords.\n\nThe usually gregarious Prime Minister attempted to strike up a conversation with Mr Corbyn as he and the left-wing leader led MPs to the House of Lords for the Queen's Speech.\n\nBut while Mr Corbyn had a warm greeting for Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, he made little attempt to engage with his Tory rival.\n\nThey walked in uncomfortable near-silence through the lobby separating the two chambers, at the head of a column of politicians, recreating a scene common at recent State Openings.\n\nA lip-reading analysis by Tina Lannin of their journey revealed that Mr Johnson asked his Labour counterpart at one point: 'How's it going?'\n\nThe Prime Minister asks: '[incomprehensible] sort of tell you how it's going?\n\nJeremy Corbyn replies' No' before the PM peppers him with a series of follow up questions to no response. Boris Johnson says: 'Yes? How is it going? Are you happy with...?'\n\nBut while Mr Corbyn had a warm greeting for Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, he made little attempt to engage with his Tory rival today (pictured)\n\nBORIS JOHNSON AND JEREMY CORBYN'S EXCHANGE Boris Johnson: ' ... ... sort of tell you how it's going?' Jeremy Corbyn: 'No' Boris Johnson: 'Yes?' Boris Johnson: 'How is it going?' Boris Johnson: 'Are you happy with...?'\n\nPerhaps simmering at his failure to win power, Mr Corbyn also ignored Mr Johnson's predecessor Theresa May as they led the procession that followed the 2017 General Election, which resulted in the current hung Parliament.\n\nAnd he also found it hard to strike up a conversation with David Cameron at the same event the previous year.\n\nBut it is not just Mr Corbyn who prefers a silent walk. Mr Cameron and Harriet Harman shared an equally frosty walk to the Lords in 2015, following the election of the first Tory majority Government since 1992.\n\nIt took place while Ms Harman was stand-in leader following the resignation of Ed Miliband and before Mr Corbyn was elected.\n\nThey walked in uncomfortable silence through the lobby separating the two chambers, at the head of a column of politicians, recreating a frigid scene common at recent State Openings\n\nMr Johnson and Mr Corbyn remain bitterly divided over Brexit, with the Labour leader saying he will whip his MPs to vote down any Brexit deal the PM manages to agree with Brussels this week.\n\nHe is also backing a second Brexit referendum after a General Election, assuming his party take power.\n\nThis is in contrast to the PM's vow to get Brexit done as soon as possible.\n\nMore Labour Brexit chaos as Jeremy Corbyn faces massive pressure to back second referendum BEFORE an election\n\nJeremy Corbyn is facing increasing pressure to back a second Brexit referendum before a general election today after a another of his senior shadow ministers broke ranks.\n\nThe Labour leader continues to insist that a second vote can only take place after the nation goes to the polls to elect a new government, which he believes he can win.\n\nBut shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman said that a referendum might be the most 'pragmatic' move because of the chaos engulfing politics.\n\nShe told the BBC's Westminster Hour: 'If we were in control of everything and we could have it mapped out the way we want then yes we would like a general election then yes we would like to have a referendum in the way we've described at conference.\n\n'But we're not in control of all of this and if there is an opportunity to have another referendum it may be that the most pragmatic thing to do is to take that opportunity.\n\n'We haven't seen the deal, we don't know what we're going to be presented with on Saturday, but I would be very surprised if there wasn't an amendment for a confirmatory ballot.'\n\nIt came as a cross-party group of MPs was revealed to be plotting to try to get Theresa May's failed Brexit deal through the Commons at the fourth time of asking.\n\nThe Labour leader (pictured today with Boris Johnson) continues to insist that a second plebiscite can only take place after the nation goes to the polls to elect a new government, which he believes he can win\n\nThey would act if Boris Johnson fails to agree a Brexit deal with Brussels and the Benn Act, which forces the Pm to seek a further delay to leaving, is enacted.\n\nAnother group of pro-EU MPs are plotting to trigger a crunch Commons vote next weekend on holding a fresh Brexit ballot, whether or not Boris Johnson has secured a deal.\n\nThey want a referendum to take place before an election, and are increasingly confident the numbers in Parliament are moving their way.\n\nMr Corbyn again made clear yesterday that he does not favour the idea, appealing for Labour MPs to show 'caution'.\n\nLabour's official position is that it wants to win an election, negotiate a new 'sensible' Brexit package, and then hold a referendum in which Remain would be an option.\n\nMr Corbyn has suggested he would try to stay neutral on whether the UK should leave the bloc, even if he has thrashed out a new Brexit deal.\n\nBut shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman said that a referendum might be the most 'pragmatic' move because of the chaos engulfing politics\n\nThe veteran left-winger was asked in an appearance on Sky News' Ridge on Sunday programme whether any deal secured by Mr Johnson should be put to a referendum.\n\n'I think many in parliament, not necessarily Labour MPs but others, might be inclined to support it, because they don't really agree with the deal \u2013 but I would caution them on this,' he said.\n\nHowever, Mr Corbyn is increasingly looking to have lost control of party policy on the crucial issue.\n\nHis long-time ally John McDonnell said last week that he might back a referendum being held before an election.\n\nAnd yesterday shadow business secretary Ms Long-Bailey suggested a ballot would be needed in all circumstances.\n\n'I know that many colleagues are of a similar opinion to me,' she told the BBC.\n\nSNP leader Nicola Sturgeon also warned that it would be practically 'impossible' for Remainers to keep a temporary PM in power long enough to push through the necessary legislation.", "description": "The State Opening of Parliament saw Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn engage in one of the newer political traditions today - the awkward silent walk to the Lords.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/13/19690900-0-image-a-27_1571054573642.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
