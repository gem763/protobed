Doing laundry mid-trip lets you get more wear out of your outfits, while still packing light. And \u201ca lighter suitcase helps you avoid extra airline fees \u2014 and leaves more room for souvenirs during your trip,\u201d according to Judy Perl, president of the Judy Perl Worldwide Travel agency.\n\nHotel laundry services, however, can be prohibitively expensive, and likely won\u2019t even be an option if you\u2019re camping, backpacking, or staying in hostels or Airbnbs. But with the help of a few handy items, Perl and the three other frequent travelers we spoke with say that it can be just as easy to wash your clothes on your own, allowing you to pack light and save money. As Stephanie Flor, the founder of Around the World Beauty, says, \u201cWhen you do your own laundry, you\u2019re in control.\u201d Below, our experts recommend their favorite detergents, garment steamers, laundry bags, and more to stash in your carry-on so you can do a load (or two) on your next trip.\n\nAn odor-fighting detergent\n\nDefunkify Active Wear Laundry Detergent Powder Flor told us, \u201cWhen doing my own laundry, I always bring my own detergent because the last thing I want to do is run around looking for a laundry place at midnight.\u201d Most of our experts agreed, offering up a number of different options depending on what you may need to wash. No matter the detergent you choose, Perl notes that \u201csmall travel packets of detergent are wonderful because you can stash them in your suitcase without taking up too much space, and you can easily wash your smaller items in the hotel sink [or] bathtub.\u201d For something that cleans well and can tackle odors on any garment, Flor loves these travel-size pouches of Defunkify powder, a detergent specifically designed for laundering sweaty activewear. She adds that Defunkify is made from plant-based, ecofriendly ingredients that won\u2019t pollute local water systems. \u201cIn many parts of the world you have to take into consideration what you\u2019re putting into the water-filter system,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s all about traveling consciously.\u201d $3 for 2 at Amazon Buy $3 for 2 at Amazon Buy\n\nA detergent for delicates\n\nA mess-free detergent\n\nTravelon Laundry Soap Sheets While the above liquid and powder detergents are fairly spill-proof, if you\u2019re very wary of messes, try these soap sheets recommended by Perl. The solid sheets dissolve in water so, as she says, there\u2019s \u201cno risk of them spilling in your bag on trips where your bag is getting tossed or jostled around more frequently.\u201d Plus, the tiny pack of 50 biodegradable sheets will take up minimal room in your luggage. Whichever detergent you use, Perl stresses the importance of bringing a sink stopper in case your hotel\u2019s or other home-away-from-home\u2019s bathroom doesn\u2019t have one (or it isn\u2019t working). $7 at Amazon Buy $7 at Amazon Buy\n\nA detergent dupe\n\nLush Montalbano Shampoo Bar Although it\u2019s meant for hair, Sandland calls this shampoo bar her \u201csecret weapon\u201d for washing clothes away from home. \u201cI used it to wash a hand-wash-only dress in the shower in Indonesia, and discovered it works really well for freshening up clothes,\u201d she says. \u201cIt only takes a few minutes, smells lovely, and is totally plastic-free.\u201d $11 at Lush Buy\n\nA washing add-in\n\nShout Color Catcher Dye Trapping Sheets Even if you\u2019re fastidious about separating your dark- and light-colored clothes at home, it\u2019s not always feasible to wash two separate loads while traveling. If you\u2019re planning to do laundry while on the road and don\u2019t want to restrict yourself to a monochrome wardrobe, Perl says these dye-trapping sheets are a \u201cmust\u201d because they \u201cprevent dyes from bleeding so you can still wash light and dark colors together.\u201d Simply toss one in the sink or bathtub while you\u2019re washing your clothes to avoid staining whites and other light-colored fabrics. $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nA mini-steamer\n\nURPOWER Garment Steamer Nail artist and frequent traveler Julie Kandalec, the creator of blog Julie Off Duty, told us she always packs this mini-steamer to give clothes a quick refresh after unpacking. Traveling with the steamer allows her to \u201cbring thinner fabrics that would normally wrinkle like crazy,\u201d she adds. Kandalec says that this one is \u201ccompact and super simple to use,\u201d and that it \u201cheats up in 30 seconds and is very, very efficient \u2014 even on hard-to-steam fabrics like linen.\u201d Flor also brings a steamer with her on work-related trips when she can\u2019t look rumpled, and Perl says that, in a pinch, you can use your \u201cshower time as an opportunity to de-wrinkle your clothes\u201d by simply hanging wrinkled garments in the bathroom while you shower and letting the hot steam do its work. $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nAn all-in-one washing bag\n\nScrubba Wash Bag When she doesn\u2019t have access to a sink or tub, Sandland relies on this innovative washing bag that\u2019s perfect for camping, backpacking, or van-living. Just add water, detergent, and clothing, then give the bag a vigorous rub against a flat surface so that the hundreds of mini nodes inside can scrub away at your dirty gear. When it\u2019s not in use, the washing bag folds down small enough to slip into any pocket of your luggage. $50 at REI Buy\n\nA washing bag for delicates\n\nThe Laundress Mesh Washing Bag Bundle We\u2019ve previously written about using these mesh bags to protect underwear in the washing machine, and Flor says the same idea applies when you\u2019re hand-washing delicates on the road. To save space, she\u2019ll also pack her undergarments in these bags before putting them in her suitcase. $15 at Shopbop Buy\n\nA laundry bag for dirty clothes\n\nReisenthel Turquoise Mesh Sack For separating your dirty clothes from clean stuff until you have a chance to wash them, Perl recommends this strong and durable laundry bag from the German brand Reisenthel. She says that the packable mesh sack \u201cfits nicely in a suitcase and is extra functional, with a zipper and a loop to hang it when needed.\u201d Even if you don\u2019t plan on doing laundry during your trip, a bag like this is useful for keeping dirty clothes together so they\u2019re ready to wash once you get home. $15 at The Container Store Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
