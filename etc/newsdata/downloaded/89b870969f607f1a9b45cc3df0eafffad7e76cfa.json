Wang Yi, in response to questions from Reuters, said the Trump administration had shown goodwill by waiving tariffs on many Chinese products. in the day, the released whistleblower report alleged that Trump not only abused his office in attempting to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. election, but that the White House also tried to \"lock down\" evidence about that conduct. The report is seen as central to the Democrats' impeachment inquiry. impeachment push has added to recent market volatility.\n\nFor the market, \"whether it turns into something more comes down to how consumers respond. Without that, it's likely short- term volatility and not much else,\" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.\n\nFacebook Inc was among the biggest drags on the S&P 500, dropping 1.5% after a person familiar with the matter told Reuters that the U.S. Justice Department will open an antitrust investigation of the social media company.
