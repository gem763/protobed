(NASDAQ: ) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 18, 2019 $7.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Michaels shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Michaels is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail \u2013 Miscellaneous industry that ranks in the Top 34% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none has dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 46 cents per share to 49 cents per share in that period.\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about Michaels right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.\n\nClick to see the trades now >>", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Zacks Investment Research covering: The Michaels Companies Inc.
