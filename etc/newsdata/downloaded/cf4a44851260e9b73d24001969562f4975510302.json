But does it point to a greater pattern?\n\nA B.C. Supreme Court judge pondered the importance of a Canada Border Services Agency mistake Wednesday as she tried to decide how the misstep might fit into a conspiracy theory alleged by Meng Wanzhou's lawyers.\n\nAssociate Chief Justice Heather Holmes repeatedly interrupted a lawyer for the Crown as he tried to minimize the significance of border officers giving the Huawei executive's phone passcodes to RCMP in error.\n\nThe mistake first emerged as an issue on Tuesday.\n\nMeng's lawyers claim the CBSA and RCMP conspired with the FBI to \"trick\" Meng into volunteering information during a customs examination before she was officially arrested after landing at Vancouver's airport in December 2018.\n\nCrown attorney John Gibb-Carsley said the passcode mistake needed to be viewed in the context of a larger set of events during which Canadian authorities acted entirely appropriately.\n\n\"I'm reminded of the old adage: 'Never let the truth get in the way of a good story,'\" Gibb-Carsley told Holmes as he wrapped up the Crown's case.\n\nThe problem with the defence's theory of the case, he said: \"The truth gets in the way of their story.\"\n\nAlleged U.S. sanctions violation\n\nMeng's lawyers want Holmes to order the disclosure of a wide variety of documents and records they believe will bolster an argument that Meng's rights were violated in the hours prior to her arrest.\n\nThe 47-year-old is facing possible extradition to the United States for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nThis phone is one of two seized from Meng when she landed at Vancouver's airport in December 2018. CBSA officers asked her for the passcodes and later passed the codes on to RCMP. (B.C. Supreme Court)\n\nShe's accused of lying to banks about the nature of Huawei's relationship with a company in Tehran that was attempting to sell U.S. telecommunications equipment in violation of American sanctions.\n\nHuawei claimed the company, Skycom, was a \"local partner.\" But U.S. prosecutors claim the firm was actually a hidden subsidiary.\n\nSitting alongside her counsel, Meng has listened intently to arguments put forward by both defence and lawyers for Canada's attorney general.\n\nBut the issue of the phone passcodes has proven thorny.\n\n'Inferences from absences'\n\nBorder officers seized the phones along with Meng's laptop and tablet when she emerged onto the jetway after flying into YVR from Hong Kong.\n\nThe FBI had suggested to RCMP the previous day that the devices be placed in Mylar bags to prevent them from being remotely wiped.\n\nThe Crown has argued that the border officers were just doing their job in determining if Meng was admissible to Canada. They say no one has ever actually searched the phones, which the FBI no longer even want.\n\nCBSA officers asked Meng for the passcodes for her phones when they seized her electronic devices. They later passed those codes in error to the RCMP. (B.C. Supreme Court)\n\nBut as she considered the facts, Holmes kept returning to the phones.\n\nIf the FBI didn't ask the CBSA to seize them, and the CBSA officers were supposedly acting independently, why were the Mylar bags used?\n\nAnd if the border agents claim that they got the passcodes as part of the process of examining Meng's goods for evidence of criminality, why didn't they search them?\n\n\"We're in a situation where we're being asked to draw inferences from absences,\" Holmes told Gibb-Carsley.\n\n\"Since we're in the land of inferences because of the absence of evidence ... we have the fact that the passcodes were given along with the devices that CBSA took on the jetway and put in Mylar bags, and we have the fact that the U.S. request was for exactly that.\"\n\nFrom Meng to Bambi\n\nIn making their case, the Crown lawyers also drew on precedent set by one of Canada's most colourful fugitives \u2014 Lawrencia 'Bambi' Bembenek, a former Playboy Bunny and police officer who fled north in 1990 after escaping the U.S. prison where she was serving time for killing her husband's ex-wife.\n\nIn that case, Canadian immigration officials were accused of using deportation proceedings as a disguised form of extradition.\n\nLawrencia 'Bambi' Bembenek was a famous fugitive who returned to the U.S. after capture in Canada. While she was here, she set a legal precedent cited by Crown attorneys who are fighting Meng Wanzhou. (The Canadian Press)\n\nLikewise, Meng's lawyers claim that the CBSA search and questioning of Meng was just a pretence for a \"covert criminal investigation.\"\n\nIn the Bembenek case, a judge found that immigration officials were acting in good faith in their efforts to deport a convicted killer.\n\nGibb-Carsley said the officers who dealt with Meng also had a legitimate purpose in guarding the border.\n\nLike Meng, Bembenek's arrest in Canada drew media from around the world, resulting in a cottage industry of Run Bambi Run T-shirts and at least one TV movie, starring Tatum O'Neal.\n\nBut the similarities end there.\n\nAfter fighting extradition, Bembenek returned to Wisconsin willingly in 1992.\n\nHer original conviction was set aside when mistakes were found in the investigation. She pleaded no contest to second degree murder and was released on probation.\n\nBembenek moved to Washington state in the late 1990s to be with her parents.\n\nShe died of liver failure in 2010.", "description": "It's one error.
