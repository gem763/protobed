However, the new living arrangement proved to be a fatal mistake as Grumpy was killed by Maxine and Patty in an attack.\n\nHappy was never able to live with the duo contentedly from there on out, with a recent reconciliation attempt failing badly.\n\nFor the past 13 years she has lived alone, separated from the other elephants by a barrier.\n\nWise is arguing that the arrangement is detrimental because elephants are social creatures and Happy should be moved to a far larger sanctuary in California, which has other elephants.\n\n\u2018Wouldn\u2019t that just be like a larger prison?\u2019 Bronx supreme court judge Alison Tuitt said, adding that Happy has lived in the enclosure for decades and has never stopped eating, a sign of depression.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s a bit like saying the Earth is a prison,\u2019 Wise replied, continuing: \u2018To cram an elephant into 1 acre of land, it\u2019s like Attica state prison.\u2019\n\nWise said in a sanctuary animals are free to choose friends and live the life of an autonomous being.\n\nDuring a length testimony, Wise compared the elephant\u2019s situation to the plight of slaves in the US, who weren\u2019t considered fully human, and pointed out that portions of the Amazon rainforest have been protected under human-like rights.\n\n\u2018She is one depressed elephant,\u2019 Wise said of Happy. \u2018She\u2019s being harmed every day\u2019.\n\nDuring a length testimony, Wise compared the elephant\u2019s situation to the plight of slaves in the US, who weren\u2019t considered fully human, and pointed out that portions of the Amazon rainforest have been protected under human-like rights\n\nA spokeswoman for the Wildlife Conservation Society, which operates the Bronx Zoo, said that Happy isn\u2019t languishing, nor kept in isolation.\n\nJim Breheny, the zoo\u2019s director, called the lawsuit \u2018ludicrous\u2019 to the Guardian and said the Nonhuman Rights Project is \u2018exploiting the Bronx Zoo elephants to advance their own failing cause\u2019.\n\nAnother WCS spokesperson said: \u2018It would be irresponsible and risky for Happy\u2019s well-being for us to bow to uninformed outside voices with political agendas.\u2019\n\nFor now, Judge Truitt has ordered Happy to stay at the Bronx Zoo, with next arguments set to be heard on January 6, 2020.\n\nMr. Wise said it is in the elephant\u2019s interest to remain there for now so that the proceedings on habeas corpus can continue.\n\nWise added the Nonhuman Rights Project is ready to settle if Happy is moved to the group\u2019s preferred animal sanctuary in California or alternatively, Tennessee.", "description": "Steven Wise, president of the non-profit Nonhuman Rights Project, believes the 48-year-old elephant is an autonomous being who has been detained illegally in the Bronx and must be released.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/14/20084120-0-image-a-2_1571836720206.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
