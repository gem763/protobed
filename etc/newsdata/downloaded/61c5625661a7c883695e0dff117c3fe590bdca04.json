Not the sort of thing you\u2019d expect to see in a family newspaper? Tell me how you\u2019d feel about someone happy for you to die for you in pursuit of their twisted cause.\n\nIt has been pointed out to me that this was someone who\u2019d just had a camera poked in their face, something they were probably unused to. They might have come up with a different response had they had the time to think their words through.\n\nThen again, perhaps not. Perhaps it would take their blood turning into a sticky syrup, their mouth feeling like the bottom of a hamster\u2019s cage, their experiencing a thirst that\u2019s impossible to slake, which are the typical symptoms an insulin dependent diabetic like me will experience if we don\u2019t get our insulin prior to death by organ failure.\n\nIt\u2019s often said that Brexit is more like a religious faith than a political movement because the rational arguments have all been demolished and reality has debunked the claims made by the Leave campaign during the EU referendum. You know, the ones that held that leaving the EU would be easy, and we could have our cake and eat it (per the BoZo in Number 10 Downing Street) and we\u2019d get rich quick if only the dead hand of Brussels were removed from the mighty Britannia.\n\nAsk people like that man in Birmingham how they think their lives will be improved by Brexit, and what the EU has done to inspire such a venomous hate that they\u2019re willing to die and kill other people along with them, and they probably couldn\u2019t answer. The high priests of the church of Brexit struggle with that, so they turn instead to myth.\n\nWhat the Beeb\u2019s man shows us is that at its fringes, and increasingly at its core, their Brexit religion is turning into a cult and a death cult at that. We\u2019re talking al-Qaeda, perhaps, the Branch Davidians under cult leader David Koresh, or one of those other unhinged sects with a penchant for murder/suicides that crop up every now and again.\n\nBuckle up, and let\u2019s mow down them diabetics, and cancer patients, and epileptics, and people with heart conditions and, well you name it.\n\nThoughtful people often like to argue that the cult\u2019s followers should be listened to and that the grievances they have are legitimate, if misdirected. I confess that I grow weary of this view.\n\nThere are millions of people with similarly legitimate grievances who haven\u2019t chosen to buy into a destructive and potentially lethal ideology dreamed up in the debating societies of posh boys who speak of \u201cordinary people\u201d with contempt when they\u2019re dining in their clubs.\n\nThere is also a substantial number of people who have united under the Remainer Now banner because they have thought through the implications of what\u2019s been happening and realised that they were sold a pup.\n\nThat man talked to the BBC about \u201cdemocracy\u201d. It\u2019s not democracy if you don\u2019t allow for the fact that people can change their minds.\n\nHowever, as much as I was angered by his callous lack of regard for the lives of other people with his condition, it is ultimately those posh boys who are to blame. They cooked this dish. Into the hot water of grievance bubbling on a hob that they created, they stirred lies, and hatred, and then added a sprinkling of racism.\n\nThe sentiments expressed by that man are the foul tasting result.", "description": "If you wanted an example of the callous selfishness of hardline Brexiteers, the BBC sure dug one up on the streets of Birmingham.\u00a0 It was another series of\u00a0vox\u00a0pops, canvassing the views of \u201cordinary people\u201d.
