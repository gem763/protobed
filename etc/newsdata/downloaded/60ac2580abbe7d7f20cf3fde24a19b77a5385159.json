Sometimes just politicians in general take the hit.\n\nThe Trudeau Transit Ad\n\nThat said, the easy targets during this election (and every single federal election that preceded it) has always been the Liberal and Conservative leaders. 22 Minutes gave a few jabs at Trudeau's earnest transit ad.\n\nAndrew Scheer scandal\n\nAnd we use the word \"scandal\" very loosely.\n\nMrs. Enid goes Face to Face with Trudeau\n\nMrs. Enid grilled the prime minister on his \"getting rid of the bird that built a nest in her hall closet\" policy.\n\nAndrew Scheer and Mark in Nova Scotia\n\n22 Minutes actually went face to face with the Conservative leader when Mark confronted Scheer in Nova Scotia.\n\nAnother option\n\nThe tug o' war between Liberals and Conservative sometimes blinds us to the other options out there.
