In August, two back-to-back mass shootings in Texas and Ohio left at least 31 people dead, and over the weekend a gunman in Texas killed seven people and wounded more than 20 in a shooting rampage. Those mass casualty incidents have increased public outcry. Walmart, for example, said Tuesday that it will stop selling handgun ammunition. And Congress will face pressure to act when it returns next week from summer recess.\n\nAmong the ideas under discussion are so-called red flag laws, which would allow a family member or a law enforcement official to petition a court for an order to take guns from individuals who may be a threat to themselves or others. But Democrats say those laws are not enough and have called on McConnell to bring up the House\u2019s universal background checks bill, which passed earlier this year. That bill so far has no Republican support.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) that would expand background checks to all commercial sales. But that bill has failed twice in the Senate, and it\u2019s unclear whether it would gain enough Republican support to pass.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Tuesday called for the Senate to pass his bill with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), that would increase funding for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System database and would focus more on mental health. But that measure, which was introduced as an alternative to Manchin-Toomey, had previously failed in the Senate.\n\n\u201cHad Grassley-Cruz been passed in 2013, had Harry Reid [and] the Democrats not filibustered it, there is a very good possibility the Sutherland Springs shooting could have been prevented,\u201d Cruz said, referring to a 2017 shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas that left 26 people dead.\n\nCruz accused Democrats of playing politics on gun safety legislation and said that \u201cregulating every private transaction\u201d would not reduce gun violence.\n\n\u201cThe 2020 presidential candidates are openly embracing gun confiscation now, mandatory federal government confiscation of private firearms owned by law abiding citizens,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t prevent crime but it does appease the Democrats\u2019 big money backers.\u201d\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

After the shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Trump tweeted that \u201cserious discussions are taking place between House and Senate leadership on meaningful background checks.\u201d But he later reportedly told Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the National Rifle Association, that background checks were no longer on the table. After the shooting this past weekend, Trump made no mention of background checks and instead called for changes to the U.S. mental health system.\n\n\u201cI will say that for the most part, sadly, if you look at the last four or five, going back even five or six or seven years \u2014 for the most part, as strong as you make your background checks, they would not have stopped any of it,\u201d Trump said over the weekend.\n\nIn addition to discussing gun legislation, McConnell again said that he would fill a Supreme Court vacancy if one came up during the presidential election. Democrats are still seething over McConnell\u2019s decision to block President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland from receiving a hearing in 2016. But McConnell insists the situation was different because Democrats controlled the White House and Republicans controlled the Senate.\n\n\u201cYou have to go back to 1880 to find the last time, back to 1880s to find the last time a Senate of a different party from the president filled a Supreme Court vacancy created in the middle of a presidential election,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was nothing I did that was, would not have been done had the shoe been on the other foot had there been ... a Republican president and a Democratic Senate.\u201d\n\n", "description": "\u201cIf the President is in favor of a number of things ...
