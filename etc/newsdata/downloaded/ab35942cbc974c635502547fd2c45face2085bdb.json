Then, in October 2018, Ivanka was pictured taking Arabella, Joseph, and Theodore to the synagogue for Shemini Atzeret, which immediately follows the seventh day of Sukkot.\n\nIt is a separate, yet connected, holy day devoted to the spiritual aspects of Sukkot.\n\nOnce again, all three children rode scooters on their way to the synagogue - although that tradition seems to have been abandoned for this year's celebrations.", "description": "Ivanka, 37, and Jared, 38, were seen strolling to the local synagogue in their Washington, D.C. neighborhood holding their three children by the hands.", "authors": ["Charlie Lankston For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/19/19704934-0-image-a-18_1571076534739.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
