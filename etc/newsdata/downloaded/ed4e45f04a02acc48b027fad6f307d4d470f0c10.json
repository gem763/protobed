It has weakened further to the low-12% range in the 2 most recent quarters. FTI projects the growth rate will fall to 5.9% in 10 years.\n\n\"The degree to which this decrease in online growth manifests itself over the next year is yet to be known,\" Yozzo said, \"but analysis suggests we may be experiencing an inflection point in e-commerce where the overall rate of growth remains in the low double digits.\"\n\nGo deeper: Axios' Deep Dive on the future of retail\n\nEditor's note: This story was corrected to show overall retail sales had been growing 5%\u20136% (not online retail sales).", "description": "Online retail sales growth has been decelerating for 4 consecutive quarters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/u2Awokc9u_w7bF9wcAkuJ-SlCb8=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/07/17/1563363216223.gif", "published_at": "2019-07-17"}
