He has been unable to complete any of the stages of the graduated return to play due to these symptoms.\u201d\n\nHodge, who will now miss Australia\u2019s crunch clash with Six Nations champions Wales on Sunday as well as the matches against Uruguay on Oct. 5 and Georgia on Oct. 11, can appeal the decision within 48 hours.\n\nRugby Australia have yet to comment on the punishment.\n\nWorld Rugby have made much of their campaign to rid the game of high hits and the fact that the match officials did not penalise Hodge even after reference to the TV pictures will be an embarrassment for them.\n\nHodge\u2019s ban has been received with fury by the Australian media, with Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph describing it as \u201cfarcical\u201d and other outlets suggesting Hodge was made an example of by World Rugby.\n\nIt is rare that Clive Woodward, who led England to their World Cup final victory over the Wallabies in Sydney in 2003, gets much good press in Australia but his criticism of the decision was widely shared.\n\n\u201cTotally wrong decision, will have huge implications for the tournament - for me this is a yellow card and no more,\u201d Woodward wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cHas any of those making this decision ever tried stopping someone as powerful as Yato by wrapping their arms around him? Good luck if you try that!\u201d", "description": "A report by an independent disciplinary tribunal has revealed that Australia winger Reece Hodge, banned for a dangerous high tackle against Fiji, was not aware of World Rugby's new rules about dangerous high tackles.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434159760&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P17M", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
