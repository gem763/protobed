(Gleb Garanich/Reuters)\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that John E. Herbst served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009. He served from 2003 to 2006.\n\nAfter trading some political pleasantries with Ukraine\u2019s new leader, President Trump began to make his case that the United States was an indispensable friend.\n\n\u201cWe do a lot for Ukraine,\u201d Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call, according to a rough transcript made public by the White House on Wednesday.\n\nTrump gave no specifics of the United States\u2019 assistance in the call, but went on to bash European allies \u2014 and Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel in particular \u2014 as not doing enough to aid Ukraine.\n\nBut now the entire U.S. aid package to Ukraine \u2014 almost $400 million \u2014 has become a key exhibit in possible impeachment probes. On Tuesday, Trump acknowledged he ordered the aid withheld during the summer before making the July call with Zelensky, who was encouraged by Trump to work with the U.S. attorney general to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\n[Trump ordered hold on military aid days before calling Ukrainian president, officials say]\n\nSince the early 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States has consistently supplied foreign aid to Ukraine, partly to foster the pro-Western political and military links in a key country bordering Russia.\n\n\u201cOur efforts have been designed to promote stability, to protect the integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, and to help it reform,\u201d said John E. Herbst, who served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009 and is the director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council.\n\nAlthough the United States is one of the country\u2019s biggest foreign-aid benefactors, other countries have also sent significant assistance to Ukraine.\n\nThe European Union and its financial institutions have provided more than $16.5 billion in grants and loans to support its reform process since 2014. In addition to those E.U. funds, Germany on its own has pledged millions of dollars in assistance, as has Britain. And Japan, meanwhile, has given $3.1 billion in assistance to Ukraine to the establishment of diplomatic relations in the early 1990s.\n\nIn 2014, after Russia annexed the region of Crimea and sparked war in Ukraine\u2019s east, Congress enthusiastically passed legislation that imposed sanctions on Russia and increased ongoing military assistance to Ukraine. The money has provided cybersecurity and intelligence support, as well as training and equipment, to the country\u2019s armed forces.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Tuesday, Trump said he had withheld aid \u2014 which was eventually released on Sept. 11 after lawmakers raised concerns \u2014 and would do it again \u201cuntil such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they\u2019re not doing it.\u201d\n\nIn a White House released transcript of the July call between Trump and Zelensky, both leaders complain about European countries, singling out Germany, for not doing enough to help Ukraine \u2014 though it was not clear they were specifically discussing financial assistance.\n\n\u201cGermany does almost nothing for you,\u201d Trump said to Zelensky, according to the transcript. \"All they do is talk and I think it\u2019s something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nZelensky told Trump he had met with the German chancellor as well as French President Emmanuel Macron and told them that they were not enforcing sanctions against Russia and \u201cnot working as much as they should work for Ukraine.\u201d\n\nU.S. assistance (and the threat of withholding it) has played a role in efforts to root out corruption and promote transparency in a country that has long grappled with cronyism.\n\nViktor Yanukovych, the country\u2019s notoriously corrupt president from 2010 to 2014, was convicted of treason by a Ukrainian court and sentenced in absentia in January to 13 years in prison. While in power, Yanukovych was widely seen as a pro-Russian puppet: The court ruled that he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine and that he violently quashed pro-Western democracy protests in Kiev.\n\nWhile the protests eventually led to Yanukovych\u2019s ouster, corruption in Ukraine remains a problem. The country scored 32 out of 100 on Transparency International\u2019s 2018 corruption perceptions index. Zelensky, a television comedian with no prior political experience, won the presidency in part by promising to tackle corruption.\n\nThe United States has in the past expressed concern about increasing security aid to the country because of graft.\n\n[The full Trump-Ukraine timeline \u2014 as of now]\n\n\u201cWe got used to assistance becoming more and more conditional,\u201d said Alyona Getmanchuk, director of the New Europe Center, a Kiev-based think tank. But she noted that conditions imposed in the past were about \u201chelping Ukraine move forward and reform itself\u201d \u2014 including encouraging the Kiev government to provide more transparency or adopt new national security measures that would further integrate it with the United States and NATO.\n\nThanks in part to the United States, Ukraine three weeks ago launched an anti-corruption court that aims to deal with high-level and political graft, Getmanchuk said.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s alleged request to Zelensky, which he has denied, makes the prospect of future U.S. aid more worrying, she said.\n\n\u201cIf those conditions are directed at making Ukraine a subject of an internal political fight, that\u2019s not a good sign,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\nAnalysts worry that if Trump was acting with the investigation of his political rival in mind, the ramifications could affect Ukraine\u2019s other bilateral relations.\n\nThe concern in Kiev could be that if it is seen as overtly cooperating with the president\u2019s demands to launch an investigation, \u201canother country could also seek to undermine Ukrainian ties,\u201d said Mark D. Simakovsky, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\n\n\u201cPoliticizing assistance to Ukraine is very dangerous, because it will ultimately erode Ukraine\u2019s assistance and independence at a time when it needs the United States most,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cUkraine, unfortunately, is in the president\u2019s crosshairs,\u201d he added.", "description": "For 28 years, the United States has sent foreign assistance to Ukraine to promote democracy and security in the region.", "authors": ["Assistant Editor", "Foreign Desk", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/z7_l9hAaQ2RbaTa2IHvYYCm7sVM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J2MXSMW63EI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
