Because I wasn\u2019t regarded as that talented, I always wanted to find out what did it make within me when people said: \u2018You\u2019re not good enough.\u2019 And my upbringing ... as my dad sat next to me negotiating a contract and saying: \u2018No, no, this is too much\u2019 \u2013 he refused to take that money. I was really angry at that time with him but he was sending me messages which were really important moving forward. I look back to those moments and think they had a bigger impact on me than I expected.\n\nSo how did those experiences shape you as a person and a player?\n\nI had a lot of adversity, with being injured, being assessed as the one who would not make it. How my parents stayed relaxed at that stage helped me a lot. You need to make sure you don\u2019t take it too serious at times and that really helped me to refocus on the moment when the opportunity really arrived. I never regarded it as: \u2018Oh, here you go, here you have everything.\u2019 That\u2019s the new generation: take, take, take. It\u2019s all about \u2018give them\u2019 then they will take care of themselves. No, no, no. If you just think it\u2019s about taxis [picking you up and dropping you off], money and credits, that\u2019s the opposite of caring for you.\n\nPer Mertesacker: \u2018It gives you the goose bumps ... on the pitch you see actual joy\u2019 Read more\n\nHas your own story been useful for the academy work you do now?\n\nI want to make an impact on young people\u2019s lives and be part of their future no matter what they do because I have seen that all the very talented players at 15, 16 still had very little chance to be successful in football. Football has taught me so much. I want to use that but still make sure there is some reality. You cannot turn the clock back 20 years.\n\nI had a totally different upbringing and background \u2013 raised in a small town in Germany. Now I am in London taking care of 180 kids who think they are the 1% who can make it in professional football. How do I manage that? By being myself, being authentic and not lying. So I tell them: \u2018You might be the 1%.\u2019 It\u2019s difficult because you have to make judgments.\n\nIf someone had judged me as a 16-year-old, then I would have been out of academy football. How do you recover from that? That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to bring in now, so you can say: \u2018There\u2019s another pathway for you.\u2019\n\nBut if the family thinks football is the only thing you can do in life, then it\u2019ll be difficult to get on with that pressure. Sometimes I get the feeling that some parents really think their son can pay for their pension, especially being in London.\n\nHas the new role been what you expected and what have been the challenges?\n\nThe amount of staff we have in academies is ... I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. It\u2019s good to take care of the players but sometimes I get confused by the number of people who have an impact on one kid \u2013 we\u2019re talking 100 people or more. It\u2019s quite a heavy load. On one hand you\u2019ve got to embrace it and try to get the best people in the academy.\n\nWhere does the reward come from for you now?\n\nYou see the players go to the first team or another club, going to the world \u2013 that should be the hall of fame. We shouldn\u2019t just focus on those who make it. We want to have more examples of successful stories. A first-team player at Arsenal or, just for the sake of argument, a doctor in America would give me similar reward; that we have impacted a young kid\u2019s life positively and that he would come back and say: \u2018Yeah, this has made me a better person.\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Per Mertesacker became a fan favourite at Arsenal.

Has Jadon Sancho\u2019s decision to go overseas changed the landscape in academy football here?\n\nYeah, I think so. We have, even from our side, academy players going to other countries. And we take value. So for us this summer was really positive \u2013 you had Alex Iwobi going to Everton \u2013 a player that established himself in the first-team. Then we have Xavier Amaechi, who\u2019s gone to Hamburg and we get a fee and add-ons. Krystian Bielik, who went to Derby in the Championship, has been a part of our academy. Jeff Reine-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde goes to France because we knew he wasn\u2019t getting the pathway in the first-team. But he creates value with that move.\n\nPer Mertesacker: \u2018Some fans want a selfie but sometimes I want to say: Let\u2019s just shake hands\u2019 Read more\n\nWhat one thing needs to change to make Arsenal world-class again?\n\nYou really want to build the best connection between players and fans, that everyone feels that this is the best club. So a real culture that everyone trusts each other that we can be world-class again.\n\nBut there are many aspects. My point is that I want to make a world-class academy, that everyone feels we get the best talent towards the first team. The first-team manager right now wants to bring us back to the Champions League.\n\nThe new technical director wants to deliver the best recruitment, which the club has not seen for a long time. So everyone has small targets but what I would say is, we want to have the trust and connection from the fans that the people in charge can deliver.\n\nDid Arsenal lose that?\n\nDefinitely. You could feel that. But still there\u2019s a more positive energy I would say right now than there ever has been. And that has been part of having a massive change in the club. I felt always as a player that you want to make the Emirates a fortress, but to build that connection again the players need to really buy into that we want to go that way, and the fans will follow for sure.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nAre players such as Reiss Nelson and Joe Willock helping to build that, especially when you see the reception they get?\n\nI agree totally, you can almost sense that there is a trust in the academy. I just want to build on that and provide the best talent. Seeing Joe playing is massive. But he needs to take that chance, as does Reiss. Lots of positive things have been said about the academy but I\u2019m not resting at all. To be world-class again means consistency and that\u2019s what we have to deliver for years to be that consistent force that is not going to lose eight games \u2013 that\u2019s unacceptable. That\u2019s probably our average. Can we have a season when we lose two or three games, and have dips of one game in a period of 10? Therefore you need to have a positive fanbase and players who live and breathe that consistency every day.\n\nFinally, tell us about Mesut \u00d6zil \u2013 what\u2019s he like and why his Arsenal career has been so tumultuous?\n\nFirst of all he loves playing football. It doesn\u2019t come across so often. He is a genius in terms of what he can produce. Once he gets the ball, he\u2019s rested, he thinks he plays in the park, he can deliver that ball that no one else can deliver. He has got that magical sense.\n\nHe wants to be OK with everyone. He is not the kind of guy who approaches people and says: \u2018You need to do this, that and that.\u2019 He\u2019s a different character and sometimes I struggled with that. When I approached him and said: \u2018This is not what we do here,\u2019 I thought that sticks with us longer. For him it\u2019s: \u2018No, that\u2019s OK, I accept that, we move forward.\u2019 I was really pissed [off] for days and weeks. But he relaxes in those moments. I know how to take him and how to try to pinch him when needed. But, ultimately, it has to come from him if he wants to go to the next level. But he can deliver. You have seen it.\n\nPer Mertesacker\u2019s autobiography, Big Friendly German, is available in all good bookshops and signed copies available at www.decoubertin.co.uk/BFG.
