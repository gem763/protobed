However, the UAW must vote to end the strike before staff return to work.\n\nThe strike started last month after the union's previous four-year contract with GM expired. It is the first stoppage since 2007, when there was a two-day walkout.\n\nGM reported profits of $8bn last year, but it has maintained a focus on remaining nimble, unveiling plans to close existing plants or shift investments, as costs rise, sales slow and the industry shifts to self-driving and electric cars.\n\nHowever, workers say they have been patient as the car giant recovered from the troubles that forced a government-led bailout in 2009.\n\nAt the time, workers agreed to pay caps and to allow GM to hire temporary workers, who receive lower pay. The union had hoped to remove those concessions this time around.\n\nNegotiations started in July, but the two sides failed to reach a deal by September, leading to the strike.\n\nIt is the longest in decades and its impact has been felt throughout the Michigan economy.\n\nAnalysts estimate it is costing GM about $90m a day. Workers have been relying on strike pay of about $250 a week from the UAW.\n\nAny deal is expected to set the tone for negotiations with other carmakers, including Ford and Chrysler.", "description": "Workers have been on strike for nearly five weeks as they demand better pay and working conditions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5904/production/_109188722_gettyimages-1155899669.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
