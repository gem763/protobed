No longer content on dominating the lower-tier processor categories, the smaller semiconductor firm began flexing its muscle. As I mentioned a few months back, AMD stole the show at the 2019 Computex industry conference. With high-level processors designed to compete and steal market share from INTC, Intel stock looked incredibly vulnerable.\n\nHowever, we\u2019re starting to see signs that the tide might turn back to Intel\u2019s favor. Recently, the company has made substantial progress with its Agilex field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs. These are modular chips capable of easy configurations to fit multiple functionalities. As such, FPGAs are incredibly valuable to companies advancing 5G network technologies. That offers synergistic opportunities that can bolster INTC stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdditionally, Intel claims that the Agilex FPGAs can either impart more performance or less power consumption than its predecessor FPGAs. The company claims that the Agilex is also useful for data centers, which I don\u2019t doubt. As a study from Berkeley Economic Review pointed out, Intel has a strong reputation for producing reliable chips.\n\nBest of all, the semiconductor giant snagged Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as an FPGA client. Naturally, this is a massive development for Intel stock. However, investors remain leery about the equity\u2019s choppy manners: can they trust INTC?\n\nComparisons Benefit INTC Stock\n\nMy answer to the above question is yes. However, it\u2019s a nuanced affirmation.\n\nObviously, one of the big challenges with the semiconductor industry is the U.S.-China trade war. If it keeps dragging, as some economists suggest, that may cap growth in the sector. Moreover, I\u2019m eyeballing the economic turmoil in Germany and Europe overall. Combined, these headwinds could devastate consumer demand.\n\nThat\u2019s the bad news for Intel stock. The good news is that the U.S. is locked in a technological race with its adversaries. Now more than ever, we need our big tech firms to innovate. Coincidentally, part of the enthusiasm over the Agilex FPGAs is Intel\u2019s competition with Chinese outfit Xilinx, which leads the sector. Intel has significantly narrowed the production and distribution gap, which benefits INTC stock longer term.\n\nTherefore, if you believe that certain semiconductors will perform well even against economic headwinds, you should consider Intel stock. Because compared to its rival AMD, INTC at this juncture may have the better outlook.\n\nYes, I\u2019ll concede that AMD has better sex appeal because of their flashy new processors. Also, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su engineered one of the most remarkable comebacks in business.\n\nAt the same time, this is also a \u201cwhat have you done for me lately\u201d business. And right now, some evidence indicates that AMD may have pushed their products too quickly without proper quality control. In the nearer term, that might not matter much. But over the long haul, it could worry clients.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s face it: in a recession, you want every dollar to count. Therefore, when organizations invest in data centers, for instance, they want consistent, reliable performance. In that department, Intel has the proven history, bolstering the argument for INTC stock.\n\nTechnical Comparison Also Supports Intel Stock\n\nMoreover, if we suffer a recession, I believe the technical argument also supports INTC stock. For one thing, AMD has ripped out another strong year so far, gaining 71% year-to-date. On the other hand, Intel is quite the laggard relatively speaking, up less than 16%.", "description": "For several years, the basic narrative behind the semiconductor space went something like this: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) provided the premium-end processors, and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) was the poor man's Intel.
