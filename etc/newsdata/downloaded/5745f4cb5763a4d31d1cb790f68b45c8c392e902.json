President Trump is currently embroiled in an impeachment inquiry examining his alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine to interfere in the U.S. election process, and his former Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton recently claimed that Democratic primary candidate Tulsi Gabbard \u201cis a favorite of the Russians,\u201d asserting that that Russia \u201chas a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d\n\nYet beyond the partisan battles, the recent DHS report, dated Sept. 12, 2019, and marked \u201cfor official use only,\u201d shows that government officials behind the scenes are continuing to sound the alarm about the type of Russian electoral interference that took place in 2016. It\u2019s an alarm, however, that experts say few in Washington seem to be heeding.\n\n\u201cThe big problem in the U.S. is that there has been no high-level political attention to this,\u201d says Alina Polyakova, founding director of the Project on Global Democracy and Emerging Technology at the Brookings Institution. \u201cCongress has not passed one single legislative bill to at least try to curb the spread of disinformation online.\u201d\n\nBut as Washington remains mired in partisan battles over disinformation and foreign influence, Russia appears to be moving forward with its own plans.\n\nThe report reveals that the DHS monitored \u201ca small sample of 22 social media accounts suspected of being controlled by Russian influence actors on social media platforms from early September 2018 to early January 2019,\u201d and found they \u201camplified divisive narratives, including content critical of US and allied foreign policy, racial discrimination and tensions, US politics and political figures, climate change, and environmentalism.\u201d\n\nThose Russian-controlled accounts also targeted specific U.S. communities, the report says.\n\n\u201cRussian influence actors\u2019 efforts on social media continued through at least early January 2019,\u201d says the report, \u201cto focus on themes including aggravating social and racial tensions, undermining trust in US authorities, stoking political resentment in racial minority communities, and criticizing perceived anti-Russia politicians, based on DHS observation of these accounts\u2019 activity.\u201d", "description": "U.S. government efforts to prevent Russia from conducting influence operations directed at American audiences have largely failed, and Moscow is continuing its attempts to influence the American political system by exacerbating social divisions.", "authors": ["Martin De Bourmont", "Jana Winter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oIhGkSTid1tv916HBncjJg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/4bd6b5c0-f680-11e9-bc5f-c960ab31f8b3", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
