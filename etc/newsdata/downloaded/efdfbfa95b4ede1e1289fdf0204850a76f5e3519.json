Immigration officials confirmed this week that deportation deferrals will no longer be considered for individuals with serious medical needs.\n\nPreviously, a small program called \u201cmedical deferred action\u201d allowed people \u2014 often children \u2014 to stay in the United States an extra two years if they were receiving treatment for severe medical needs. In many cases, these families came to the country through legal means but simply did not complete the medical treatment in the original time allotted, and are seeking more time to continue their care.\n\nAs first reported by WBUR Boston, several applicants for this kind of deferral were surprised to receive letters from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) informing them that the agency was no longer considering such requests. Moreover, they were told they only had 33 days to leave the country, after which they could be forcibly removed, which would make it much harder to return in the near future to continue treatment.\n\nPerhaps the most stunning part about these sudden refusals is that the administration never even announced a policy change. Only after WBUR first published its story about the letters did USCIS confirm that the requests would now be submitted to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for consideration. An ICE spokesperson then claimed, \u201cAs with any request for deferred action, ICE reviews each case on its own merits and exercises appropriate discretion after reviewing all the facts involved.\u201d The blanket denials suggest medical deferrals have no longer have such merit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe medical deferral program had been in place for decades, ensuring that individuals could receive medical care that isn\u2019t available in their home countries. The Irish International Immigrant Center, which reported at least five of their clients were denied deferrals, explained that it serves many families whose children have cancer, cystic fibrosis, HIV, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, and epilepsy.\n\nFor example, 16-year-old Jonathan Sanchez is fighting to stay after coming on a tourist visa because there is no treatment for cystic fibrosis back in Honduras. \u201cIf they deny the program, then I need to go back to my country, and I\u2019ll probably die,\u201d he said at a press conference Monday.\n\nThe denial letters claim that USCIS will only consider deferred action requests for \u201ccertain military members, enlistees, and their families.\u201d This is hardly reassuring, given the administration also indicated earlier this summer its desire to begin deporting the families of active duty service members.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-857579534.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
