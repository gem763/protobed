Example: The film begins with rookie New Orleans cop Alicia West (Naomie Harris) jogging-while-black when she is stopped by white patrolmen who are stunned to discover: \u201cShe\u2019s blue!\u201d\n\nWest\u2019s harassment and the suspicion of her are the point of this scene and of the entire film, which exploits public distrust of police \u2014 and even distrust by one of their own. The background of black cops\u2019 social expectation and racial indoctrination, detailed by Charles Burnett in The Glass Shield (1994), is ignored.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSet in a post\u2013Hurricane Katrina New Orleans of dilapidated, still-unrenovated neighborhoods \u2014 the result of natural catastrophe, local ineptitude, and government corruption \u2014 Black and Blue bruises the image of modern urban America. In addition to furthering the bad reputation that cops have suffered since the 2014 Ferguson protests, the film perpetuates civilian negativity. It\u2019s a thriller that sells cynicism: skepticism as entertainment.\n\nHeroine West is an Afghanistan war veteran who came home and joined the force, looking for a purpose. (\u201cI want to help,\u201d she explains. \u201cFood banks and inner-city programs help,\u201d she is told.) West\u2019s ideals are shaken when she discovers systemic corruption among a squad of narcs. The only new gimmick is that West\u2019s body cam \u2014 standard issue after Obama\u2019s response to Ferguson \u2014 records dirty cops executing several black drug dealers. This ignites a subplot in which West\u2019s former disenfranchised homies also turn against her. Behaving like enraged activists, the lawless New Orleans blacks fight against the cops, leaving West in the lurch. Is she more blue than she is black?\n\nBlack and Blue doesn\u2019t have to be high quality to be treacherous. Director Deon Taylor and screenwriter Peter A. Dowling borrow black urban grievance as carelessly as a politician. The film is bracketed by disillusioned rap records: Lecrae\u2019s \u201cWelcome to America\u201d and KRS-One\u2019s \u201cSound of da Police (That\u2019s the sound of the beast).\u201d Still, it\u2019s implausible that after two tours of duty in Kandahar, West would be so na\u00efve about American life. Or do the filmmakers intend to portray modern America as Afghanistan, an irresolvable tribal war?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the title clearly indicates, Black and Blue operates on the premise of clich\u00e9s. What makes it of passing interest for us is how it takes those clich\u00e9s (feel-good, action-movie formulas) and uses them to animate political truisms \u2014 the platitudes behind news reports devoted to social-justice narratives.\n\nIn movie speak, it translates the issues associated with Hurricane Katrina and Ferguson, Mo., into the Denzel Washington police thriller Training Day, modifying that fevered police-brutality scenario with a female protagonist so that it fits the millennium\u2019s Me Too agenda. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 maze in which viewers are led into confusing reality with fantasy, allowing comfortable sentiment to oppose difficult history.\n\nBlack and Blue\u2019s rush of movie excitation \u2014 of chases and shootouts \u2014 overwhelms us with angry cop faces that are indistinguishable from thugs and with chaos that\u2019s underscored by constantly booming sound effects. There\u2019s no way out of the film\u2019s twists and turns except, in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s memorable phrase, to \u201creject its hypothesis.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack and Blue represents a form of commercial and political calculation too amateurish to call irresponsible; it\u2019s merely desperate. (Ultraslick Training Day was irresponsible.) No one in this film\u2019s second-tier cast is even remotely believable \u2014 from Harris\u2019s British mien, which lacks authentic cultural nuance (just as her role as a crackhead mom in Moonlight merely relied on ghetto-wretch clich\u00e9s); to Tyrese Gibson\u2019s lonely storeowner Mouse, a black male so demoralized that he seems zombified, who helps West hide from her crooked colleagues; to Mike Colter\u2019s exoticized drug dealer Darius, whose gold teeth, gold necklace, purple pimp\u2019s attire, and glowering, seething manner is even more outlandish than his role as TV\u2019s Luke Cage.\n\nMy favorite detail in this wildly contrived sociological horror-plus-redemption story is its New Orleans housing-projects location. The apartments feature numerous African artworks, and Mouse hangs a Kehinde Wiley\u2013style poster of Malcolm X surrounded by printed repetitions of the word \u201cFreedom.\u201d Where\u2019s the more likely MLK-Malcolm-Obama Trinity on black velvet? Cinematographer Dante Spinotti (Last of the Mohicans) stylizes this postmodern landmark so that its gaudy, graffiti-splattered terraces are brightly illuminated oases at night. It resembles either a very progressive penitentiary, a carnival, or an art museum such as New York\u2019s PS1 or the Whitney Biennial showcasing the latest enlightened social-justice, identity-politics exhibition.", "description": "'Black and Blue' is a gaudy exhibition of action-movie and progressive clich\u00e9s.", "authors": ["Armond White", "Ilya Shapiro", "Mairead Mcardle", "Kevin D.
