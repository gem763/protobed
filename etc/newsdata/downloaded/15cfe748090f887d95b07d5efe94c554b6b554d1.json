Listen to a song or watch a movie/television show that elicits an emotional response. Volunteer \u2014 share your gifts with others in need. Get in touch with your creativity: Draw, paint, build, garden, write/read poetry, whatever you enjoy (everyone has some form of creativeness). Practice gratitude. Take an inventory of things for which you're thankful.\"\n\nOther therapists agree.\n\n\"Write down what you are grateful for in that day, even if it's as small as being grateful for the ability to take a deep breath,\" says Mollie Volinsky, LCSW, a New York City-based psychotherapist who specializes in trauma and anxiety. \"Go for a walk outside, as moving your body and changing your perspective allows the brain to shift states where it will feel less down/anxious/ stressed etc ... Practice mindfulness. There are many apps and youtube videos that offer guided meditations. Mindfulness allows you to get out of your head and stressful future-thinking and into your body and the present moment.\"", "description": "Allow yourself to feel what you're feeling, and identify it.
