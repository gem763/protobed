Per-share earnings dropped to $2.05 from $4.07 -- ahead of the $1.92 consensus among analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nSales fell 21% to $20 billion. Boeing handed over just 63 jetliners in the September quarter compared with 190 in the same period last year, with analysts estimating it is piled up around 350 undelivered MAX jets, as well as the 380 grounded in March.\n\nThe company also announced steps to manage its liquidity after burning through $2.4 billion in cash over the past three months, on top of the $1 billion drained in the prior quarter.\n\nCredit-rating firms have put Boeing on watch for a potential downgrade because of its weakening liquidity.\n\nBoeing has already set aside an initial $5.6 billion to cover compensation payments to MAX customers, and reached deals with some carriers. As well as cash payments, Boeing is also offering discounts on future sales, delivery positions and services.\n\nIt hasn't suffered any cancellations because of the MAX crisis, but slowing traffic growth and airline failures have dented orders this year.\n\nBoeing boosted its liquidity to $10.9 billion at the end of the quarter after tapping the debt markets. The $2.4 billion cash drain in the quarter was much worse than analysts expected, with airlines withholding payments on jets and suppliers securing better payment terms. Boeing said its debt levels are 'manageable.'\n\nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 23, 2019 08:48 ET (12:48 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
