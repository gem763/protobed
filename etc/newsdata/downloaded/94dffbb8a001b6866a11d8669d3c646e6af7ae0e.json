(Oct. 11) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Defense Secretary Mark Esper, in his first public statement on the crisis in Syria, blamed Turkey on Friday for the conflict with the Kurds, a key U.S. ally.\n\nEsper said the United States had \"not abandoned the Kurds\" when it pulled back this week from a portion of the Turkish border after a phone call Sunday between President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nKurdish forces, who fought side by side with U.S. troops against the Islamic State \u2013 as recently as last weekend \u2013 are under attack as Turkey's military continues to step up assaults on the region.\n\nU.S. and Kurdish soldiers: Side by side days ago, battling ISIS, now the Kurds are under attack\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said the U.S. has \"not abandoned the Kurds.\" (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images)\n\nThe Trump administration has sent mixed signals about U.S. strategy in the region. The withdrawal, Trump said, fulfilled a campaign promise to end U.S. wars in the Middle East. He disparaged the Kurds for not helping in World War II.\n\nEsper called Erdogan's decision to attack \"impulsive.\"\n\nU.S. forces in the region were shocked by the decision to pull back 50 American troops from the border area, providing an opening for Turkey's attack and ending the joint fight against the Islamic State in that part of Syria. Turkey would have been loathe to attack if it risked killing American troops.\n\nOn the ground: Turkish strikes hit civilians as Syria offensive intensifies\n\nTrump's order was seen by lawmakers such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., as a betrayal of an ally that has suffered 11,000 deaths fighting alongside U.S. troops to roll back the gains the Islamic State had made since 2014. It drew bipartisan condemnation in Congress.\n\nEsper urged Turkey to end the incursion, which he said caused \"dramatic harm\" to U.S. relations with Turkey, a NATO ally. He called for a diplomatic solution.\n\nArmy Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said U.S. forces in Syria, estimated at 1,000 troops, would continue to work with Kurds in the Syrian Democratic Forces, but Americans would not intercede between them and the Turks.\n\n'A reckless gamble': Four reasons critics decry Trump's 'impulsive' Syria withdrawal\n\nsyria (Photo: usa today)\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/11/pentagon-esper-blames-turkey-kurds-attack-not-abandoned/3944109002/", "description": "Top Pentagon officials blamed Turkey for fighting Kurds in Syria and said they had not abandoned the Kurds, an ally in the fight against ISIS.", "authors": ["Tom Vanden Brook", "Published P.M.
