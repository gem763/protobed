He demanded to see financial records. He wanted to see his brother more advanced/settled in a career, and wanted to know my career trajectory as well. Both of us have been in the same companies for 5+ years, and don't have dead end jobs. He also wanted us in a house and not an apartment. He felt that I and his brother needed to get therapy for 'being different'. Along this line, he wanted his brother to 'act more normal'. We would also need to convert and follow their family's religion and 'not be a heathen'.\n\n\"I was furious when I received this. HE COULD HAVE JUST SAID NO.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"That he acted like the sole way for us to have children and like he could control our lives is ridiculous.\n\n\"I don't want to adopt BECAUSE I don't want to have a third party telling me what my standards are. I'd rather be childless.\n\n\"I called him, screamed at him for the horrifying email, and said I wouldn't want his goods if he was the last person on earth.\n\n\"My husband is urging me to consider his terms, which I'm not interested in. Am I in the wrong here?\"\n\nShe went on to explain that she didn't have a problem with her brother-in-law saying no, it was the way he did it which upset her.\n\nThe question split opinion, with one user saying: \"You're the a**hole. You asked him a question, he responded in an email that you didn't like.\n\n\"Then you called and yelled at him because he didn't respond the way you wanted him to.\"\n\nOthers took her side, arguing: \"That's all pretty bad but when I got to the part about coercing you into converting religion I almost lost it. HELL no.\"", "description": "A man who listed requirements for his brother and sister-in-law before he agreed to be their sperm donor is dividing opinion online", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty Images", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20714993.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sad-young-couple-hugging-at-home.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
