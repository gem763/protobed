Iran is too big for the U.S. to invade even if there were appetite among U.S. voters for another Gulf war, and has demonstrated its ability to strike back hard should the U.S. decide to escalate.\n\nU.S. sanctions have cratered the Iranian economy. Yet administration hopes that this would lead to a popular backlash against the government in Tehran, forcing it to cave to American demands, have yet to bear fruit.\n\nInstead, the regime has relied on responses honed over 40 years of international isolation, upping the ante to show that if the U.S. continues forcing Iranian oil exports to zero in an attempt to bankrupt its government, Iran has the power to halt the oil exports of U.S. ally Saudi Arabia, too.\n\n\u201cWe are caught in this vicious circle,\u201d said Ali Vaez, Iran Project Director at the Brussels-based International Crisis Group. \u201cThe U.S. has to realize that Iran is part of this region. Iran cannot be excised.\u201d\n\nRevolutionary Guard\n\nRather than retreat in the face of withering revenues, which was a part of the logic that informed U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal that had lifted sanctions, the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is increasingly active in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and even Afghanistan.\n\nFor the Guard -- which has long defined itself as the Middle East\u2019s ultimate bulwark against U.S. military power -- sanctions are almost seen as a call to arms.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s Backbone is Broken; The U.S. and al Saud are in Mourning!\u201d crowed the front page headline in Monday\u2019s edition of Kayhan newspaper, whose chief editor is directly appointed by Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nOn social media, too, the mood among Iranians has been more jingoistic than fearful.\n\nA 2017 clip of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman saying \u201cwe won\u2019t wait for the war to come to Saudi Arabia, we\u2019ll take the war to Iran,\u201d has been widely recirculated and mocked in recent days. \u201cWell Bin Salman my brother, tell me how\u2019s Aramco doing?\u201d said one Twitter user\u2019s caption for the clip, referring to Saudi Arabia\u2019s leviathan oil company.\n\nRegional Influence\n\nThat bravado is ultimately misplaced, because nothing Iran has done to date has brought the lifting of sanctions -- the central problem for the country of 82 million as a whole -- any closer, according to Michael Knights, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. At the same time, Iran\u2019s capacity to make its interests felt across the region has been on full display.\n\n\u201cWe have a sequence of events since about May 12, where the Iranians have pushed on one red line and relationship after another,\u201d said Knights. \u201cFrom a military perspective it has really been superbly executed, from tanker attacks that didn\u2019t spill a drop of oil into the Gulf, to these now, which were of the same quality that the U.S. would have displayed in the mid-90s, using the cruise missiles it had then.\u201d\n\nEach tactical success has further raised Iran\u2019s prestige in the region, a higher priority for regime conservatives and the IRGC than restoring the economy, according to Knights.\n\nThat forward-leaning approach is part of a longer term game plan, as Iran seeks to benefit from a gradual U.S. withdrawal from the region that\u2019s likely to continue regardless of who is elected president in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has been looking for years for a re-posturing in the Middle East that would entail a lighter commitment on their end,\u201d said Cinzia Bianco, Arabian Peninsula research fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, a think tank. \u201cThis is crucial to what happened with Aramco, because the IRGC is fully aware of this context and is trying to test its new limitations.\u201d\n\nBalance of Power\n\nThe attack could have a lasting impact on the balance of power in the region, because it cruelly exposed the scale of an ongoing change in the U.S.-Saudi relationship, according to Pierre Noel, senior fellow for economic and energy security at the International Institute for Security studies, in London. \u201cThe Saudis lost in 30 minutes the war they had been preparing for for 50 years,\u201d Noel said in a briefing on Tuesday. \u201cThey lost 50 percent of their national oil output, to Iran, and without the U.S. being immediately able or willing to offer cover.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Earlier this year, President Donald Trump warned that \u201cit\u2019s going to be a bad problem for Iran if something happens.\u201d Something big has happened with an attack on Saudi oil infrastructure, and yet the administration in Washington looks like the one with the problem.After leading voices", "authors": ["Marc Champion", "Zainab Fattah"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.ZtDb6BiseZm9mm_xV5reA--~B/aD0yMTAxO3c9MzE1MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/c795b9f5b613c72f3384169a4bd22fea", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
