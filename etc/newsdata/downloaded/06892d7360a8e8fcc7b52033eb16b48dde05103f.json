She is meaner and more ready than ever to do what it takes to save humanity once more.\n\nReunited with Hamilton for the first time in 28 years, Schwarzenegger is in riotous form as he reprises his role as the T-800.\n\nThe once-feared killing machine appears to have grown a conscience, acquired a family and settled into domestic bliss without anyone suspecting his true nature.\n\nUnderstandably, Arnie is given all the best and funniest lines here, which he seems to delight in delivering in the Terminator\u2019s characteristic deadpan tone.\n\nAnd while there are perhaps one too many gags about the banality of his new \u201cwhite picket fence\u201d life, you can\u2019t help but chuckle along each time.\n\nTully (2018) star Mackenzie Davis proves once more that she really is the real deal by giving one of the best physical performances we\u2019ve seen from her so far.\n\nFor her part, Reyes delivers a world-class performance as a young woman who carries the fate of the world on her shoulders.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate isn\u2019t just a welcome addition to this much loved franchise, it is also easily the most fun you\u2019ll have watching an action film at the cinema this year.\n\nWith impressive action set-pieces, elaborate car chases and more big guns than you can shake a stick at, we get the feeling that we\u2019re finally back in safe hands.\n\nAnd while more recent sequels like Salvation and Genisys all but failed to recapture the ethos of the original franchise, what Tim Miller and James Cameron have finally given us here is a film which proudly takes into account where it originated from. Believe this hype.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate is released in UK cinemas on October 23, 2019.", "description": "Terminator has finally returned to what made it so brilliant as director James Cameron recaptures the ethos of the original franchise in the most fun action film all year", "authors": ["Linda Marric"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20700471.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Terminator6ED.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
