For the photograph, I thought it would be really cool for the driver to be in the ride, so I stand back, and he\u2019s in the car, starting to hop it. Keep in mind that I was shooting with a twin-lens medium format Mamiya, which is not the fastest camera out there, and after I got two or three frames, one of front wheels fell off, a result of the additional weight.\u2019", "description": "Hunter Barnes documents people on the edges of US society. \u2018I never go to a place with a camera first,\u2019 says the photographer. \u2018I spend a lot on beer and coffee instead\u2019", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5177a4d60e0226cba6d6009a44c1acab463411e6/193_1457_8629_5178/master/8629.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=733e58e013000ce970c410a102008b60", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
