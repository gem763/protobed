Soon enough, it all came undone. That summer, Trump would tell reporters that there were very fine people \u201con both sides\u201d of the clash between white supremacists and protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, that turned deadly.\n\nAround that time, Cummings was growing steadily disillusioned with the president. He didn\u2019t believe that what he had told Trump earlier in the year had made any real impression. Phone calls between the two stopped. What had looked like a fledgling alliance between two men of different parties, backgrounds, and races\u2014a rarity in this political era\u2014collapsed. \u201cNow that I watch his actions, I don\u2019t think it made any difference,\u201d Cummings told me after the president\u2019s first year in office. \u201cI thought it had an impact at the moment, but his actions have not shown that.\u201d\n\nThis weekend, things took another ugly turn. Beginning yesterday and continuing today, Trump sent a series of tweets blaming Cummings for poverty in his district. Calling Maryland\u2019s Seventh a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess,\u201d Trump wrote that \u201cno human being would want to live there.\u201d (Neither the White House nor Cummings\u2019s office responded to my request for comment about the president\u2019s tweets.)\n\nAdam Serwer: The press has adopted Trump\u2019s reality-show standards\n\nOne does not have to be much of a sleuth to figure out what\u2019s behind these latest effusions. Minutes before the president sent the tweets, Fox & Friends had aired a report showing trash-strewn streets and decaying buildings in the West Baltimore neighborhood that is part of Cummings\u2019s district. But the real spark may have come Thursday, when the House Oversight Committee, chaired by Cummings, voted to subpoena emails and text messages flowing from White House officials on personal accounts outside government systems, a move that could prove embarrassing to the president\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner. Both have said through their attorney that they used personal accounts while working in the White House, The New York Times reported.\n\nIn his tweets, Trump wrote that Cummings \u201cspends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through \u2018Oversight.\u2019\u201d He complained about money going into Cummings\u2019s district and, without presenting any evidence that anything was amiss, asked how much had been \u201cstolen.\u201d\n\n\u201cInvestigate this corrupt mess immediately!\u201d Trump tweeted. Who, exactly, should launch such an investigation and what, precisely, should be investigated, Trump didn\u2019t say. But it hardly matters. The message seemed like a brushback pitch aimed squarely at Cummings, a reminder that Trump, as the head of an executive branch that includes the Justice and Housing Departments, possesses a daunting arsenal of retaliatory powers against many of his opponents.", "description": "Two years before calling the prominent black congressman \u201cracist,\u201d the president was briefly humbled by him.", "authors": ["Peter Nicholas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/EC/facebook.jpg?1564357798", "published_at": "2019-07-28"}
