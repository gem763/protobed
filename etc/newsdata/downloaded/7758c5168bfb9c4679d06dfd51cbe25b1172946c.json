In 1994, he returned to the army to command a brigade and then a division in the occupied West Bank.\n\nAccording to his official army biography, he was Israel\u2019s military attache to the United States from 2005 until 2009.\n\nHe was chief of staff from 2011 to 2015, when he retired, and has boasted in video clips of the number of Palestinian militants killed and targets destroyed under his command in the 2014 war with Gaza\u2019s Islamist Hamas rulers.\n\nGantz has a BA in history from Tel Aviv University, a master\u2019s degree in political science from Haifa University and a master\u2019s in national resource management from the National Defence University in the United States.\n\nHe is married and a father of four.\n\nA security hawk, he is determined \u2014 like Netanyahu \u2014 to keep the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank under Israeli control and to maintain Israeli sovereignty over annexed Arab east Jerusalem.\n\nThe two are also in step on external threats, such as archfoe Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah.\n\nGantz has pledged to improve public services and show \u201czero tolerance\u201d for corruption \u2014 a reference to graft allegations facing Netanyahu.\n\nRegarding the Palestinians, the Blue and White election manifesto speaks of wanting to separate from them, but does not specifically mention a two-state solution.\n\nGantz is liberal on social issues related to religion and the state, favouring the introduction of civil marriage.", "description": "Jerusalem (AFP) \u2013 Former armed forces chief Benny Gantz has a shot at ending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s record-breaking term", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/59556e_armed-forces-chief-benny-gantz-has-shot-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
