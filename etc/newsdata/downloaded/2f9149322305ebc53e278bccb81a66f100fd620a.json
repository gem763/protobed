That's why we need to introduce a frequent flyer levy.\n\nThe committee did not object to a third runway at Heathrow, pictured in an artists' impression, but added it would 'limit growth at non-London airports'\n\n'Most of the environmental damage from air travel is caused not by annual family holidays but by very frequent leisure flights by those at top end of the income spectrum.\n\n'A frequent flyer levy is the fairest and most effective way to keep aviation emissions within safe limits, at the same time as protecting access to some air travel for all.'\n\nDr Doug Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said the Government's current aviation strategy is incompatible with the net zero target, 'and must be revised'.\n\n'The new strategy must focus on restricting demand growth, and will either require Heathrow's third runway being cancelled, or capacity restrictions on other airports to balance Heathrow's expansion.'\n\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: 'The fight against climate change is the greatest and most pressing challenge facing the modern world and this government recognises that aviation and shipping have a crucial role to play in tackling it.\n\n'The government has already made clear its commitment to zero emission shipping in the Clean Maritime Plan, which was published earlier this year. We are also committed to setting a clear ambition for the aviation sector and will carefully consider the advice of the Committee on Climate Change when we publish our position on aviation and climate change for consultation shortly.'", "description": "The Committee on Climate Change has suggested the UK government could introduce new charges and make changes to aviation taxes to help cut emissions and meet green targets by 2050.", "authors": ["Joseph Curtis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/24/12/18864948-0-image-a-14_1569322996173.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
