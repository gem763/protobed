You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\"At this stage, we consider that there is no justification for a new extension,\" Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, had said on Tuesday afternoon ahead of votes in the House of Commons.\n\nBut other voices in Brussels have backed the plan pushed by Mr Tusk. David Sassoli, the European Parliament president, on Wednesday said it would be \"advisable\" to back the three month extension, adding: \u201cThis extension will allow the UK to clarify its position and the European Parliament to exercise its role.\"\n\nA three month delay is seen as the default option for EU leaders, because it was the length specified in the Benn Act that forced the prime minister to request a delay in the fist place. However, the situation is complicated because Boris Johnson has said he does not want a delay at all.\n\nEU leaders can also choose to vary the length of an extension if they believe one should be longer or shorter \u2013 as they did when they imposed a longer extension on Theresa May earlier this year. But the bloc's authorities are wary about being dragged directly into a UK domestic political debate.\n\nHopes that the withdrawal agreement could be approved by Westminster in just three days were dashed on Tuesday night after MPs rejected the programme motion put forward by the government and said they needed more time to scrutinise the legislation.\n\n\"Following prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to pause the process of ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, and in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit, I will recommend the EU27 accept the UK request for an extension. For this I will propose a written procedure,\" Mr Tusk said late on Tuesday night after the votes were counted in Westminster.\n\nThe European Council president rang around EU leaders on Wednesday to drum up support for the three month plan.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
