The rates market will see that as a signal that rates will remain low for even lower,\u201d said Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING.\n\n\u201cThe second surprise is a more generous TLTRO, with the maturity increased to three years with more generous terms,\u201d he said, adding that this will help Italy in particular.\n\nItaly in fact led the rally in government bond markets with 10-year bond yields sliding 20 basis points to a record low at 0.78% IT10YT=RR.\n\nAcross the euro area, 10-year bond yields were down 8-10 bps on the day with 30-year German Bund yield pushing decisively back into negative territory have dipped above 0% earlier this week DE30YT=RR.\n\nThe euro fell back below $1.10 EUR=EBS after initially surging on the ECB announcement.\n\nAfter trading as high as $1.1070, the single currency then dropped to $1.0961, the day\u2019s low and down 0.5% on the session as investors digested news of the rate cut and relaunch of QE.\n\nThe euro hit a 28-month low earlier this month of $1.0926.\n\nInflation expectations meanwhile shot up to 1.31% EUIL5YF5Y=R, their highest level since late-July, as the ECB\u2019s policy action boosted confidence in the central bank\u2019s ability to lift inflation. It had been at 1.26% earlier in the day.\n\n\u201cSo far, the headlines point to the ECB not holding back, with Draghi getting his way one last time,\u201d said Marchel Alexandrovich, senior European economist at Jefferies.\n\nEuro zone stocks meanwhile swung into positive territory after the announcement, though the benchmark index STOXXE eased off the session high to stand 0.3% higher by 1225 GMT.\n\nThe euro zone banking index .SX7E jumped as much as 1.4%, cheering the introduction of rate tiering, a move that should mitigate the pain of lower interest rates on the battered financial sector. However, the shares later slipped 1.6%.\n\nCarsten Brzeski, chief economist ING Germany said it remained unclear if the ECB move would be sufficient to get growth and inflation back on track.\n\n\u201cThe real elephant in the room is fiscal policy. It is clear that without fiscal stimulus, Draghi\u2019s final stunt will not necessarily lead to a happy end,\u201d he said\n\nBritain\u2019s 10-year gilt yields GB10YT=RR dropped 6 basis points on the day to 0.58%, dragged lower by the fall in euro zone bond yields. U.S. Treasury yields also tumbled as the ECB\u2019s policy action rippled out across world markets US10YT=RR.", "description": "Bond yields tumbled across the euro zone on Thursday and the single currency fell toward recent 28-month lows after the European Central Bank cut interest rates and resumed asset buying, while bank shares ceded early knee-jerk gains.", "authors": ["Dhara Ranasinghe", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
