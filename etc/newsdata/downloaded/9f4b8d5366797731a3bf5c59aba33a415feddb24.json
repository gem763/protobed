YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE {{item.title}}\n\nA waterbuck had to fight for his life after being caught up in the deathly jaws of a crocodile in Kruger National Park.\n\nThe struggle for survival was captured by retiree Mike Johnson next to a dam between Skukuza and Satara.\n\nWATCH: Wild dog plays dead to escape lion\n\n\u201cWe were driving towards Satara and stopped at the dam to have a look. There was a splash at the far end of the dam. Thinking it was a hippo, we did not pay much attention to it at first, but when a group of waterbuck appeared seemingly agitated, and we saw that one was struggling with something, I attached a 500mm lens to my camera to get a better look what was happening.\n\n\"Through the lens, I saw it was a crocodile that had been dragged out of the water by a waterbuck, away from where I assumed it was caught, and that the crocodile was trying to pull the buck back into the water.\n\nALSO WATCH: This warthog might just beat Caster after bolting from seven sneaky lions\n\n\"As the waterbuck tired, the crocodile managed to pull it back to the water\u2019s edge, where the buck lay still for a while. After a short breather, the waterbuck then made a break for it when the crocodile changed its grip. The buck managed to hobble away, but had a broken front leg. We stayed for a while to watch the other waterbuck checking out what had gone on.\"\n\nFind Your Escape by searching and comparing flight prices here.
