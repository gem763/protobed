One Trump official said the culprit is likely a career government employee who works in the White House, not a person appointed by Trump himself, but did not offer specific evidence.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe search has been approved by the office of acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and Trump himself \u2014 who has been infuriated by leaks from within his White House \u2014 is aware of the mole hunt and supports the effort, according to one of the officials.\n\nAxios on Sunday published Trump\u2019s private schedules for the past three months that showed how he spent 60 percent of his time in unscheduled \u201cexecutive time.\u201d Aides say he uses those time blocks to watch TV, call people, read newspapers and do other work. Based on a week\u2019s worth of these same private schedules, POLITICO had also reported in October Trump\u2019s extensive amount of free time that\u2019s unprecedented for presidents, including nine hours of \u201cexecutive time\u201d in one day.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

But White House officials and Trump allies insist such barbs are unfair, saying that the president actually makes productive use of his time.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a slacker. The guy works. He may not have it all scheduled but the guy\u2019s a grinder,\u201d David Urban, a former senior Trump campaign adviser, said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s not a guy who sits on his hands. Just because it\u2019s not listed on the schedule,\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean that Trump isn\u2019t doing substantive work. \"I think it\u2019s more the betrayal of who would give it up, more than anything,\u201d Urban added.\n\nOn Twitter last week, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich even favorably compared Trump to the late British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who often worked in bed while wearing pajamas, and said leaders\u2019 schedules should be evaluated based on \u201cachievement not activity.\u201d\n\nA White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But after Sunday\u2019s Axios story, the White House director of Oval Office operations, Madeleine Westerhout, tweeted that the leak had been a \u201cdisgraceful breach of trust\u201d that failed to reflect \u201chundreds of calls and meetings.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar position for the Trump White House, which has pledged to root out leakers in the past \u2014 most recently after a New York Times op-ed penned last year by a senior administration official identified only as \u201cpart of the resistance inside the Trump administration.\u201d In the wake of the op-ed\u2019s publication, the White House embarked on a search for the official that has yet to turn up the culprit.\n\nAlthough officials have suspects in mind, they say it is too soon to implicate anyone with high confidence. \u201cBoth career and political staff receive the daily public schedule, but I want to be very careful that we don\u2019t try anyone in the press,\u201d said one of the officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unprofessional to be trusted with information that is not intended to be publicly disclosed and then disclose it, whether it\u2019s related to the president, related to your co-workers or your office, it\u2019s just not professional behavior,\u201d said the official.\n\nThe other official also said the version of the schedule given to Axios and previously to POLITICO \u201cis very similar to the public version that we give to the press every single day. So that version of the schedule isn\u2019t that secret.\u201d The official noted that a much more tightly held personal private schedule that shows every call and meeting has not leaked. That would be an even more alarming breach for the White House.\n\n\u201cWe all have much bigger things to worry about and much bigger things that are going on. so it\u2019s not that big of a deal. but it\u2019s more just unnecessary and it was just a petty thing to do,\u201d said the person. \u201cIf you\u2019re leaking the schedule, what else could you be leaking or what other information?\u201d\n\nWhile White House officials want to punish past leaking, they also hope that a vigorous search might create a deterrent against future leaks of damaging information.\n\n\u201cYou take the list of who the schedule was sent to and you take who was on that list and who has access to certain things and it\u2019s not that difficult to find out who the person is,\u201d said one of the officials. \u201cThe government tracks everything on [employees\u2019] computers.\u201d\n\nWhile every president has suffered leaks and breaches of trust, they have defined the Trump presidency more than any other. From the outset, Trump was forced to contend with leaked transcripts of his phone calls to such foreign leaders as Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nAfter he telephoned Russian President Vladimir Putin last March to congratulate him on his recent reelection, The Washington Post disclosed that his staff had specifically given him a message before the call reading \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE.\u201d\n\nTrump has also been contending with tell-all accounts from former loyalists within his White House. While disgruntled administration officials have aired their grievances in tell-all books before, Trump has endured more of these tomes, and earlier in his presidency, than any of his predecessor.\n\nIn the latest, former White House communications aide Cliff Sims recounts the president calling to demand the names of White House leakers.\n\n\u201c\u2018Give me their names,\u2019 he said, his eyes narrowing,\u201d Sims writes. \u201c\u2018I want these people out of here. I\u2019m going to take care of this. We\u2019re going to get rid of all the snakes, even the bottom-\u00adfeeders.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe hunt continues \u2014 as do the leaks.\n\nGabby Orr contributed to this report.", "description": "An exasperated Trump is aware of the search, which is making use of the White House IT office.", "authors": ["Daniel Lippman", "Eliana Johnson", "Heather Caygle", "Sarah Ferris", "Melanie Zanona", "Beatrice Jin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/cd/8e/cb1b8a3647349a73951bddbd0cd4/1928-donald-trump1-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-08"}
