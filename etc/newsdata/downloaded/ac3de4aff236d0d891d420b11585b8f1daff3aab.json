Fortunately, the jury saw through it,\" Mims told FOX Business. \"I think about all of the people that have been in that situation and didn't speak up for themselves. I'm fortunate I had the lawyers I did.\"\n\nDISNEY AIMS TO BLOCK GENDER PAY LAWSUIT FROM RECEIVING CLASS-ACTION STATUS\n\nMims says after his 12-year-old son had wandered away from the water park, he took off to find him in other sections of the park. When he found his son, he immediately called his wife. That\u2019s when he says he was approached by a park employee who told him he needed to put a shirt on. Shortly thereafter, it was alleged that two security guards arrived and told Mims that he had to leave the park because he was not wearing a shirt.\n\nMims said after an argument he agreed to leave but guards followed him out of the park and tried handcuffing him. The lawsuit alleges they slammed him to the ground and beat him.\n\nSix Flags did not immediately return FOX Business\u2019 request for comment regarding the verdict.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"This case serves to indicate the importance of citizens taking action by filming any interaction with police and security,\" said co-counsel Donald Huskey of the Law Offices of Donald R.
