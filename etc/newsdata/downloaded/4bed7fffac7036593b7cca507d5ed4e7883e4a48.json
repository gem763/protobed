Still, the post promises that its functionality will be expanded in the coming weeks.\n\nAmong the new wallets committed to integrate the feature are D\u2019CENT Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, Bitcoin.com, Opera, TrustWallet, imToken, Portis, MyCrypto, Haven, Atomic Wallet, Squarelink, Coin Request, DexWallet, Enjin and Wyre.\n\nExpanding beyond .ETH\n\nThe team also plans to integrate the DNS namespace to support addresses like .org, .com and others. This functionality has already been implemented for such domains as .xyz, .luxe, .kred and .art, according to the announcement. ENS intends to roll out support for all DNSSEC-enabled top-level domains in the near future.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported on Oct. 1, ENS name auctions were halted because of a bug that resulted in domain names being awarded to the wrong users and for lower bids. Still, the hacker \u2014 who stole 17 names by exploiting the bug \u2014 decided to return all the domains to the rightful owners some days later.", "description": "Distributed naming system Ethereum Name Service announces the launch of multicoin support as 15 crypto wallets already plan to utilize the new feature", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMDJkZTRiZjFlMTczNmY1ODlkZGQ3ODMzYjRlMDgwOGMuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
