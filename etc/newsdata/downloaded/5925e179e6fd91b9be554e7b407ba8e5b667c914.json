As mother and child tried to dodge Mitchell's advances and call police he told them: 'They can give me a lift home' before he hurled a mattress at the victims.\n\nA policewoman and colleagues arrived at the house in Bolton, Greater Manchester, but Mitchell sunk his teeth into the female officer's hand during a struggle telling her: 'You didn't expect that did you?'.\n\nHe was later bailed but returned to the victim's home to terrorise her and then subsequently ambushed her during a shopping trip saying: 'I'm going to smash your windows tonight and strangle you'.\n\nIn a statement Miss Rosevere whose daughter was born during a previous relationship said: 'She has become more clingy as a result of what happened - I don't want him in my life or my daughter's.'\n\nAs Natalie Rosevere (pictured) and her child tried to dodge Mitchell's advances and call police he told them: 'They can give me a lift home' before he hurled a mattress at the victims. A policewoman and colleagues arrived at the house in Bolton, Greater Manchester, but Mitchell sunk his teeth into the female officer's hand\n\nOn Friday at Manchester magistrates court, Mitchell who was previously a North West bantomweight champion was jailed for 24 weeks after he was convicted of assault, criminal damage and harassment. He was also banned from contacting the victim under the terms of a two year restraining order.\n\nThe court heard the couple had been in a romance for five months but split up on May 1 following a series of arguments.\n\nRobin Lynch prosecuting said: 'On May 4 at 9am the complainant heard banging on her door and shouting, swearing. She opened the door and he barged his way in, took her phone and tried to leave with it. She attempted to prevent him from leaving by pushing him into the living room but he then slapped the aggrieved across the face causing her to fall to the floor and then dragged the victim round the room by her hair.\n\nMitchell (pictured) was later bailed but returned to the victim's home to terrorise her and then subsequently ambushed her during a shopping trip saying: 'I'm going to smash your windows tonight and strangle you'\n\nMr Lynch added: 'When police arrived, the defendant was very obstructive. Officers went to search him but he refused and pushed the bathroom door into the police officers and a tussle ensued. One of the officers tried to keep the defendant in a head lock to stop another officer getting punched in the face. The defendant then bit a female officer on the finger. As he's being led to the van said 'you didn't expect that did you'.'\n\nMitchell was quizzed and bailed but went back to the victim's home on June 22. Mr Lynch added: 'She had been informed he had been bailed and she heard a knock at the door and looked through the living room window to see the defendant stood there.\n\n'She ignored him but he continued to knocks at the front and back door. All went quiet for about 20 minutes and she opened the door only for him to forced his way in and refuse to leave. The aggrieved went upstairs to her room but he jumped on her and punched to the side of her face four times. He shoved a bathroom door with such force it came off its hinges.'\n\nAt Manchester magistrates court, Mitchell was jailed for 24 weeks after he was convicted of assault, criminal damage and harassment. He was also banned from contacting Natalie Rosevere under the terms of a two year restraining order\n\nMitchell ran off but attacked Miss Rosevere again on August 22 whilst she was walking to her mother's home after a shopping trip.\n\nThe prosecutor went on: 'She felt a strong pull to her rucksack and fell backwards and it took a few seconds for her to realise it was this defendant.\n\n'She got up and ran towards the main road but he grabbed her again and she fell to the floor. The aggrieved admits she began to kick out but he slapped her on the head. She said she managed to kick the defendant to the chest and ran away but heard him shouting 'I'm going to smash your windows tonight and strangle you'.'\n\nMitchell denied most of the charges but was convicted after a trial. He said: 'The story is fabricated on so many different levels.'\n\nHis lawyer Steven Connor said: 'He is adamant the complainant has bombarded him with texts. When bailed initially by the court he should have resisted, should have been stronger and stayed away and he regrets what he did. He recognises this toxic relationship with this lady is utterly and completely at an end.'\n\nSentencing JPs told Mitchell: 'These offences are so serious that custody is the only option. It was sustained attack on an ex partner in the presence of her child and then the violent assault of police officers going about their normal every day duties.'\n\nMitchell was also ordered to pay \u00a3100 compensation to the policewoman.", "description": "Former North West bantamweight champion\u00a0Lee Mitchell was jailed for 24 weeks at Manchester magistrates court.
