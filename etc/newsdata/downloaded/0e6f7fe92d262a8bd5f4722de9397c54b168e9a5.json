The story was a report on Dr. Lorraine Day, a prominent orthopedic surgeon who was quitting her job because she was terrified of catching the virus that causes AIDS.\n\n\"It had everything a '60 Minutes' story is supposed to have,\" Kroft told \"60 Minutes Overtime\" in 2013. \"It's got a great character. It's got controversy. It deals with an important issue.\"\n\nTo the surprise of Hewitt, and even veteran correspondent Mike Wallace, Kroft performed better than they expected\u2014they even gave him a standing ovation.\n\n\"Looking back now, I looked a lot younger, and I was much skinnier, and that's very disheartening. And it's obviously the first thing that came to my mind,\" Kroft said in 2013 about his first story. \"But I was surprised by how good the piece was, in retrospect, and how tight it was. But that's '60 Minutes.'\"", "description": "In 1989, Kroft reported on a potential shortage of nurses and doctors due to the growing fear of contracting the virus that causes AIDS", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/08/cf2c46be-f497-4310-a9d8-db33e52b4245/thumbnail/1200x630/51c49d65a6f4446f2438332faa0e7f30/ot-drdayisquitting.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
