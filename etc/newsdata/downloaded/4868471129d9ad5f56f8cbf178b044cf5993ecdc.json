Photo: Netflix\n\nThe kindest way to make a case for the misbegotten Henry V saga The King is to imagine that its director, David Mich\u00f4d, and his co-screenwriter, Joel Edgerton, wanted with all their hearts to do for Shakespeare\u2019s Falstaff what Quentin Tarantino did for poor Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: Give him an exhilarating new destiny. In this case, though, that means transforming one of literature\u2019s epic libertines \u2014 the Lord of Misrule, the Clown Prince of Cowards, the leader into temptation of the heir to English throne, heartbreakingly renounced at the end of Henry IV Part II when Prince Hal is crowned King Henry V \u2014 into the wisest, bravest, most morally evolved mentor this side of Merlin the Magician. Yes, this Fat Jack (though not so fat, and played by Edgerton himself) is a drunk and a whoremonger, but his dissolution, we\u2019re led to understand, came in the wake of the horrors that he witnessed fighting innumerable pointless wars. He\u2019s a soldier who sees with the eyes of Shakespeare\u2019s Michael Williams, who in Henry V says, \u201cI am afeard there are few die well that die in battle.\u201d As the new king\u2019s most trusted adviser, he counsels against war with France \u2014 girding Henry\u2019s own pacifist leanings \u2014 but is helpless before the tide of history. Agincourt draws on apace \u2014 i.e., shit happens.\n\nI admire the ethical clarity of this retelling, as I admire this Falstaff for his bitterly realistic view of war and this Henry (played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) for his vigorous moral contortions. But admiration has its limits. I hate that, in order to make a case against leaders who concoct bogus intel to dispatch their subjects/citizens to kill or be killed, Mich\u00f4d and Edgerton have turned a story we still debate into the most dully conventional kind of morality play \u2014 one that gets duller and more predictable as it grinds along. With one exception: I didn\u2019t predict Henry\u2019s vigilante avenger gesture in the penultimate scene, which makes him seem like the Plantagenet Jack Reacher. (Question for discussion: Can a king be a vigilante if by definition he embodies the state? Tune in next week.) Henry\u2019s impromptu murder is meant to show that he\u2019ll now be morally accountable for his actions, which makes all kinds of non-sense.\n\nMinus soliloquies, this Hal/Henry is not easy to read. He enters relatively late in the film, after Hotspur (Tom Glynn-Carney) has already commanded our respect and fear. In the opening scenes, Hotspur grimly executes a wounded rebel and then turns his wrath on King Henry IV (Ben Mendelsohn) for refusing to pay ransom for an imprisoned ally. Glynn-Carney\u2019s rage hits home, even if you don\u2019t know the full particulars. That Hotspur is more compelling than Hal isn\u2019t the problem \u2014 he\u2019s more compelling in Shakespeare\u2019s Henry IV Part 1, too. But he sticks around until the end of the play, whereas here he\u2019s gone so fast that we\u2019re brought up short. So now it\u2019s just dreary, depressive Hal?\n\nIt pains me to say that Chalamet is only okay, which reflects less poorly on the actor than on me. I rhapsodized over his performance in Beautiful Boy, ending with the question, \u201cHow\u2019s his iambic pentameter? I smell something rotten in Denmark if he has the technical skills.\u201d (Don\u2019t you hate when critics anoint young actors on the basis of two or three performances? And we never learn.) In any case, Chalamet has a ways to go before tackling Hamlet. His Prince Hal looks like a bony, whey-faced, lank-haired Tim Burton protagonist, an emo rich boy who angrily tells his father he has no interest in the throne and then, out of nowhere, manifests world-class fighting skills \u2014 but only because he\u2019s a peacenik and wants to prevent further fighting. It\u2019s a hopeless conception. Once crowned, his refusal to stick to his father\u2019s martial agenda \u2014 first taking France, then marching on to Jerusalem \u2014 outrages the lisping archbishop and interferes with the plans of sundry lords to procure French real estate at fire-sale prices. It\u2019s at that point that the new king reaches out to Falstaff. \u201cI acknowledge my neglect of you, John,\u201d he says, shamefaced, and the movie goes downhill from there, building to Agincourt in the modern, antiwar tradition \u2014 a series of ugly scrums in which blood and mud commingle and no one feels like high-fiving. Again, I admire the sentiment but wish Mich\u00f4d had crafted something more surprising. Henry\u2019s \u201crealistic\u201d St. Crispin\u2019s Day speech wouldn\u2019t fire up runners at a charity 5K.\n\nThe King has enough in its coffers to keep you moderately engaged. Edgerton would be fine by any other name, though the character\u2019s combination of dissipation, moral superiority, and tactical genius would still be a groaner. Mendelsohn is, as always, startlingly present, his Henry IV in the final stages of poisoning from the fear that someone will do to him what he did to Richard II. Behind a white beard, Sean Harris \u2014 the creepy criminal mastermind of the last two Mission: Impossible movies \u2014 has a good moment or two as an avuncular but enigmatic advisor. As Henry\u2019s kid sister, Thomasin McKenzie (of Leave No Trace and the upcoming JoJo Rabbit) is thoroughly charming. Lily-Rose Depp shows up for the final scenes as the French king\u2019s daughter, and I\u2019ve never seen anyone who looked this much like a computer composite of her parents (Johnny D., Vanessa Paradis). It\u2019s freaky.\n\nBut in the freaky sweepstakes, no one comes near Robert Pattinson\u2019s blond dauphin, his glam exhibitionism overwhelming Chalamet\u2019s emo angst. Pattinson\u2019s idea of a snotty Frenchman might owe a lot to John Cleese (\u201cYour mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries \u2014 now go away or I shall taunt you a second time!\u201d), but few movies have needed that sort of intentional silliness as much. Falstaff provided much of the levity in Shakespeare\u2019s original, but this Falstaff, when the dauphin delivers his flowery threats, ostentatiously yawns. In more ways than one, he\u2019s a stick in the mud.", "description": "David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s Netflix movie, featuring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Joel Edgerton, Robert Pattinson, Lily-Rose Depp and more, is a dull morality play \u2014 with one exception: a Plantagenet Jack Reacher moment.", "authors": ["David Edelstein"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/09/09-the-king.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
