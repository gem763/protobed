They\u2019re going to get stabbed.\"\n\nIn interview, Rahman claimed he was subjected to racist threats from the four tree surgeons.\n\nBut sentencing, Judge Potter said this was a 'pack of lies'.\n\nHe said: \"The fact that a mob could be mobilised so quickly and so heavily-armed is clear evidence in my judgement that you are each associated with gang activity.\"\n\nJudge Potter described the violence as Rahman's gang as 'asserting control' over the neighbourhood of Newbold in Rochdale.\n\nSajid arrived at the scene just as the violence began.\n\nMr Storrie said he launched a 'devastating attack' on the youngest of the tree surgeon crew that was 'to shape irreversibly the events of the afternoon.'\n\n\"Sajid arrived by car, halting to get out and stride towards the confrontation; he had secreted his weapon down the waistband of his trousers; he removed it and, without the slightest hesitation or inquiry, in his first blow, he struck out at the chest wall of [the victim],\" said Mr Storrie.\n\nHe followed up with the '360 degree swing' which virtually severed the victim's hand off.\n\nJudge Potter said the young man had been acting as 'peacemaker' and was 'completely defenceless' when he was subjected to the 'savage and brutal act'.\n\n\"You committed an appalling act of violence,\" Judge Potter told Sajid, \" and took concerted efforts to conceal what you had done.\"\n\nThe court heard the terrifying attack only came to an end when one of the tree surgeons picked up a chainsaw and revved it in an effort to scare them away.\n\nAnother victim fled to a nearby care home and managed to call emergency services.\n\nPolice in Rochdale launched a major investigation into the disorder under the codename Operation Beehive.\n\nHabibur Rahman and Sajid were among twelve arrested in dawn raids in January last year. Nine others were later released without charge.\n\nJudge Potter said none of the group had showed 'a shred of remorse' throughout proceedings, refusing to give evidence during two trials.\n\nHe said the events of October 17, 2017, have had a 'profound effect' on the four tree surgeons, adding: \"Each struggles with the memory of the scenes of violence they were subjected to.\"\n\nPolice have not release a picture of Mohammed Awais Sajid.", "description": "WARNING - GRAPHIC IMAGES: Mohammed Awais Sajid was aiming for the victim's head but cut off his hand in Rochdale", "authors": ["Steve Robson", "Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Pa", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20539151.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Minshull-Street-Crown-CourtJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
