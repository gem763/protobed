A Bitcoin you can use to buy stuff with the help of the social network.\n\nLibra\u2019s supporters, and there still remain a few outside of the tech giant\u2019s California HQ, could counter with something like \u201cwell they would say that wouldn\u2019t they because it threatens their business model\u201d.\n\nBut the project\u2019s first board meeting was held in Geneva yesterday without Mastercard, Visa, Stripe, eBay, Mercado Pago, all of which pulled out last week, and PayPal, which quit earlier this month.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nTo have these leaders in the fields of payments and digital commerce publicly voicing similar doubts, at least by implication, doesn\u2019t bode well for the project.\n\n\u201cI would caution against reading the fate of libra into this update. Of course, it\u2019s not great news in the short term, but in a way it\u2019s liberating. Stay tuned for more very soon,\u201d said David Marcus, the former PayPal president whose now in charge of Calibra, Facebook\u2019s digital wallet for the cryptocurrency, in a punchy looking tweet to which you could also say \u201cbut he would say that wouldn\u2019t he\u201d.\n\n\u201cSpecial thanks to @Visa and @Mastercard for sticking it out until the eleventh hour. The pressure has been intense (understatement), and I respect their decision to wait until there\u2019s regulatory clarity for @Libra_ to proceed, vs the invoked threats (by many) on their business,\u201d he declared in another.\n\nThat pressure is coming from regulators and politicians. And Marcus is quite correct to describe it as intense. A couple of members of the US senate\u2019s banking committee wrote to Visa, Mastercard and Stripe warning of increased scrutiny just last month, for example, and there\u2019s more of that sort of thing going on behind the scenes. It\u2019s a message that\u2019s being heard too.\n\nWatchdogs around the world have real concerns about libra becoming a gift to money launderers, terrorists and others generally grouped under the heading \u201cbad actors\u201d. To avoid it becoming that, you would have to charge someone (ie Facebook) with collecting vast reams data on the people using it.\n\nWe\u2019ve become used to posting intimate details of our lives over the social network with occasionally malign results, particularly with regard to the way it has been weaponised by those with a political axe to grind.\n\nWould you really be comfortable with allowing this company to collect financial data on you too? I know I wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThere are also genuine concerns about its impact on the world\u2019s financial stability.\n\nFrance\u2019s finance minister Bruno Le Maire has already said it should be blocked in Europe on grounds of the risks it poses to the latter, as well as to sovereignty and because of what he sees as the potential for abuse.\n\nLibra has made much of the potential upside, its potential use as a means of exchange by the world\u2019s poor and \u201cunbanked\u201d, the benefits that could accrue from people being able to easily, and cheaply, transfer funds across borders.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The main course will arrive next week when Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg appears before a hostile congress in an attempt to persuade lawmakers that the doubters have it wrong and that a libra revolution is nothing to fear.\n\nThat would be a tough sell even for God\u2019s own salesman. Zuckerberg is something less than that. Perhaps the chief benefit of libra, if, as seems likely, it collapses under the weight of its contradictions, would be to teach tech\u2019s disrupter in chief a little humility. So it mightn\u2019t be without some form of public benefit.", "description": "They didn\u2019t approach us or any of the other major banks\u00a0but when we looked at it we just couldn\u2019t understand how it would work.\u201d\u00a0This is the view of a major banking group on the subject of libra, Facebook\u2019s so-called \u201cstablecoin\u201d.
