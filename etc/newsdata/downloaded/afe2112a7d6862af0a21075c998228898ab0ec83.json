And JPMorgan has lined up 100 investors to review an all-debt financing package, also around $5 billion.\n\nWeWork's board will see both proposals by the end of the week, CNBC reported Wednesday.\n\nSee more: How WeWork spiraled from a $47 billion valuation to talk of bankruptcy in just 6 weeks\n\nThe debt and equity deal would give SoftBank more stakes, but not a majority of voting rights, and the company would not become a SoftBank subsidiary, the outlet reported.\n\nSoftBank's latest deal may not solve WeWork's governance issues, depending on how the voting shares work out, said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's business school.\n\n\"If they do it without getting voting control away from Neumann, they will miss their best chance of solving the governance problem that will keep the company from going public,\" he told Business Insider in an email.\n\nOn Sunday, The Wall Street Journal reported that SoftBank could invest several billion in equity and debt in a deal that would value WeWork at under $10 billion. The company was last privately valued at $47 billion in January. The Wall Street Journal reported that this deal would see much of Neumann's voting power shift to SoftBank, which already has two board seats, and the company would play a bigger part of leading WeWork's turnaround. The money could also be used in part to help Neumann repay his hundreds of millions in personal bank loans.\n\nIt's unclear if SoftBank now plans to help Neumann repay his debt, and how the deal would affect the investor's board seats.\n\nA representative for SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for WeWork declined to comment.\n\nSoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son picked Marcelo Claure, the company's chief operating officer, to help WeWork's new co-CEOs. Claure, the former CEO of Sprint, has been working with about 20 SoftBank employees to evaluate WeWork's global leases and real estate.\n\nRead more: Sex, tequila, and a tiger: Employees inside Adam Neumann's WeWork talk about the nonstop party to attain a $100 billion dream and the messy reality that tanked it\n\nSoftBank isn't WeWork's only option for a bailout.
