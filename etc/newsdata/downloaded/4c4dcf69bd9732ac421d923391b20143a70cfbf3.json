Her parents rushed her to the hospital Tuesday morning after Avant was unresponsive, according to a Facebook post from her cousin Wendy Scott. At first, doctors thought the girl had bacterial meningitis. By Thursday, they'd concluded that, instead, Avant had a deadly brain infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).\n\nPAM is caused by Naegleria fowleri, or the \"brain-eating amoeba,\" that can be found in warm, freshwater around the world. Just days before she checked into the hospital, CBS Dallas-Fort Worth reported, the 10-year-old had been swimming in the Brazos River.\n\nView of the Brazos River north of Interstate 20, Parker County, Texas.

PAM has a fatality rate of more than 97%; of the 147 cases in the US since 1962, only four people have survived.\n\nRead More:A Florida man died after losing 25% of his skin to flesh-eating bacteria. Experts say the infections will become more common as ocean water warms.\n\nEarlier this year, a 59-year-old North Carolina man died of the infection after swimming at a water park. In October 2018, a California boy contracted the amoeba after entering a hot spring in the Eastern Sierras, according to a CDC report. His symptoms didn't set in until 12 days after he'd gone swimming, then he was dead within three days.\n\nNaegleria fowleri enters our brain through the nose\n\nAccording to the CDC, Naegleria fowleri is never found in saltwater; rather, it's most common in freshwater lakes, rivers, and hot springs. Infections occur when people go swimming or diving in these bodies of water.\n\nWhen the sediment in a lake or river gets disrupted, these brain-eating amoebas are stirred into the water, and then that contaminated water gets inhaled into a swimmer's nose. The amoeba then uses the olfactory nerve to migrate to the brain, where it causes PAM.\n\nPeople can't get infected from swallowing contaminated water, however, infections have occured after swimmers inhaled inadequately chlorinated swimming pool water or heated and contaminated tap water, the CDC reports.\n\nNaegleria fowleri thrive in warm waters, and grow best in temperatures up to 115 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nDeep River swimming hole in Cumnock, North Carolina.

Later symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, seizures, hallucinations, and coma. After symptoms manifest, the infection progresses rapidly and usually causes death within about 5 days, the CDC reports.\n\nBut these brain-eating amoeba are difficult to detect and even harder to treat, Sullivan wrote.\n\n\"The initial symptoms can easily be mistaken for a less serious illness, costing valuable treatment time,\" he said. Sullivan added that there is no quick diagnostic test for the amoeba; patients are often mistreated for viral or bacterial meningitis, just like Avant.\n\nBy then, it is often too late for patients, as \"the presence of the parasite leads to rapid and irrevocable destruction of critical brain tissue.\"\n\nThis is the 36th brain-eating amoeba case reported in the US since 2009\n\nVery few people survive an encounter with brain-eating amoeba. Avant is the 147th case of PAM in the US in the last 57 years. Of those 147 people, only four have survived \u2014 one in 1978, two in 2013, and, most recently, one in 2016. Avant's family hopes she will be the fifth survivor.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2018, 36 PAM infections were reported in the US. Of those cases, 32 people were infected by recreational water, three people were infected after performing nasal irrigation using contaminated tap water, and one person was infected by contaminated tap water used on a backyard slip-n-slide, according to the CDC.\n\nStates where cases of Naegleria fowleri, or brain-eating amoeba, have occurred through 2018. CDC\n\nTypically, most Naegleria fowleri cases occur in the 15 southern-tier states, with more than half of all infections occurring in Texas and Florida.", "description": "Naegleria fowleri, or \"brain-eating amoeba,\" can cause deadly brain swelling and infections.
