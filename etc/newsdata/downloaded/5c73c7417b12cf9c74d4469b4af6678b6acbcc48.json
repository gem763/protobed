About 35% of the loans in the severely derogatory balance were student loans.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening at the CFPB now, when it comes to the student loan market, is just an utter neglect of the duty that they are supposed to perform,\u201d said Frotman. \u201cThere's congressionally mandated reports that they have failed to do, that the new director herself admitted that the Bureau is essentially being blocked from overseeing nearly a trillion dollars of student loans and they refuse to take action on their account to stand up for borrowers. \u2026 These consumers deserve a watchdog to be working on their behalf.\u201d\n\nKathleen Laura Kraninger testifies before a Senate Banking Committee hearing on her nomination to be director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., July 19, 2018.

Warren told Yahoo Finance. \u201cIt took over a year for the CFPB to hire a new student loan watchdog, and then CFPB appointed a former executive of a student loan giant accused of cheating students to do the job.\u201d", "description": "The former student loan ombudsman for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) believes that agency has been a \u201ccomplete failure\u201d over the last year and has \u201ccompletely walked away from its mission\u201d regarding student loan borrowers.", "authors": ["Aarthi Swaminathan", "Finance Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CKbdhUcA6ZHMxS2Myjl3YA--~B/aD0xNDMwO3c9MjAyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/bd37e2d0-d186-11e9-b7d6-629eb370fab4", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
