This website is normalising porn and the type of sex teenagers are unlikely to get.\n\n\"If the message they are getting from the council is [dangerous sex] is fine, how will they feel when they are uncomfortable? They will think there is something wrong with them.\n\n\"We are not against sex education, but we need to show how damaging porn is. We are coming at this from a safeguarding point of view.\"\n\n(Image: Safe Schools Alliance/Click off)\n\nRespect Yourself, which currently says it is 'under review', contained information about issues including puberty and STIs, and also hosted a Q&A section where visitors could ask for advice.\n\nOne 12-year-old girl said she had a crush on her female music teacher and can't sleep because she is addicted to masturbation.\n\nThe response said: \"What you are going through is perfectly natural for a girl your age - for some reason we have the idea that only boys gets turned on, masturbate or watch porn. That is nonsense.\"\n\nIt continued: \"Before I go any further I need to point out that there is no way that you would ever be able to act on your feeling for your teacher.\"\n\nIn another section, it tells teens not to be embarrassed by porn and masturbation, saying: \"You may have seen there\u2019s been quite a lot in the media recently about the dangers and harms that porn causes to young people.\n\n(Image: Safe Schools Alliance/Click off)\n\n\"Many people have been quite vocal and do truly believe that porn is dangerous for young people to watch.\n\n\"However, there are no scientific studies that give evidence to suggest that watching porn is any more likely to turn you into a sex addict than watching a violent film is likely to turn you into a serial killer. In fact there is more evidence to suggest the opposite.\"\n\nCampaign groups SSA and Click Off started a petition against the website and still want answers over how some of the content came to be published, including the 'Sextionary' section which described some sex acts as painful.\n\nBoth say it failed to discuss the fact young women usually experience these as 'risky and coercive'.\n\nIn a joint statement, both argued it was inaccurate to say watching porn is not linked to harmful sexual behaviour.\n\nIt read: \"In failing to condemn the use of pornography the Respect Yourself guidance is effectively sacrificing the best interests of women and girls in order to seem \u2018sex positive.\u2019\n\n\"The poorly reasoned approach of Respect Yourself will undoubtedly prevent many adolescents in Warwickshire from enjoying healthy, mutually enjoyable sexual relationships in adulthood.\"\n\nWarwickshire County Council told the Metro: \"The council carefully considers all comments raised about our services. We have decided to review the content of a few of our pages which have raised a small number of concerns.\"\n\nThe Mirror has approached the council for comment.", "description": "Warwickshire County Council suspended the 'Respect Yourself' website after a petition was launched by campaign groups", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty Images", "Safe Schools Alliance Click Off"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20704193.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Young-Girl-Using-Smartphone.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
