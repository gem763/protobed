They\u2019ve glued themselves to a DLR train. @skynews #ExtinctionRebellion pic.twitter.com/GttjEK00xO \u2014 Jenny Longden (@JenLongdenNews) October 17, 2019\n\nPolice then arrested some of the protesters:\n\nPolice have now arrived at the station and have arrested the two protestors. \u2014 Mahatir Pasha (@mahatir_pasha) October 17, 2019\n\nAccording to one of the Extinction Rebellion activists, they targeted the train because. . . well, this is bonkers:\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s heading for the city, which is the god of our time \u2026 humanity, the planet is crucifying itself on economic growth.\u201d Ruth Jarman, another @CClimateAction #ExtinctionRebellion activist, explains why they have targeted the DLR. pic.twitter.com/WFxcLmjS9R \u2014 Damien Gayle (@damiengayle) October 17, 2019\n\nThey\u2019re losing the people, especially with their attack on the mode of transportation *THEY* tell us to take:\n\nLike, I get the point #ExtinctionRebellion are making and yes, protest often needs to be uncomfortable, but my dudes, the tube is public transport. Low emission public transport. This is not your target audience. People are now taking cabs. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb \u2014 Mitten d'Amour (@MittenDAmour) October 17, 2019\n\n#ExtinctionRebellion on trains ? 1. These are working people. Do you want them on your side or not 2. This and the conceptual dance bollocks make you seem like middle class delusionals. 3. Target those in power. Punch up not down 4. Ur tactics not ur cause is what\u2019s wrong \u2014 Reverend&TheMakers (@Reverend_Makers) October 17, 2019\n\nAnd it looks like there\u2019s some damage control going on here:\n\nToday\u2019s action on public transport was opposed under any circumstances by 72% of #ExtintionRebellion supporters, according to a poll shared with the @guardian. Passengers at Shadwell DLR were also not impressed, although some were supportive. pic.twitter.com/ldLGsBwcsG \u2014 Damien Gayle (@damiengayle) October 17, 2019\n\n***", "description": "\"I need to get to work, I have to feed my kids\"", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Am On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/New-Project-22.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
