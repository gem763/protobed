Having skipped the song\u2019s premiere on Saturday Night Live, I\u2019d seen the images and their deconstructions on the internet all weekend. And when I finally sat down to watch the full product, as opposed to just a collection of GIFs and clips, I didn\u2019t even have it in me to turn on the sound.\n\nWhen it comes to \u201cwhat people on the internet say about black [insert word here],\u201d I am instantly leery. And, as a matter of course, I\u2019m instantly fearful of any form of black public expression that white people either identify as something they can\u2019t live without or pull away from. With zero sound, the images from Donald Glover\u2019s latest musical project felt like monsters under the bed.\n\nI had a nightmare that night.\n\nThe next morning, the headlines were predictable, analytical and, in a basic way, accurate. Yes, Glover\u2019s new work combines (insert description for juxtaposition of serious and jovial that represents how black people either stay sane, or don\u2019t). And the new work certainly was designed to provoke (insert group of people here who don\u2019t want to believe that the symbolism of black people killing other black people is ever effective). It is all of these things, certainly.\n\nThe specific mimicry of deplorable stereotypes that call back to an era we try to forget.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that I needed someone else to show me in video form exactly what\u2019s torn our nation apart. It\u2019s that with no real major tricks or magic, he could scare me enough into remembering that I won\u2019t see this disaster alleviated in my lifetime. Which, in itself, compounds the original fear, which is why this video is keeping me up at night. As the kids say, I\u2019ve never felt more seen in my life.\n\nSometimes I don\u2019t automatically wake up from a nightmare, even when I know I\u2019m having one. There\u2019s a weird part of me that knows I\u2019m sleeping and wants to explore whether or not I can tackle the specific fear. In this video, there\u2019s an eerily similar pace: Things come and go, and images from the recesses from your brain pop up in ways you never imagined.\n\nYou\u2019ve already read about the guns. The choir. The white horse. The cars. The African dance influences. And, of course, SZA. But those are specifics in a deliberate and detailed oeuvre already witnessed by likely more than hundreds of millions of people.\n\nBut to be clear, this isn\u2019t about anointing Glover/Gambino as some saint. We\u2019ve all seen how problematic that turns out in many cases, and it\u2019s also unfair to the artists themselves. The \u201cgenius\u201d category puts everything in a spotlight that is skewed and often pointless \u2014 and this is not to discredit Glover\u2019s work by any means.\n\nHowever, Glover is not without his wild statements that some may find problematic. He\u2019s said a few things about women of color, specifically Asian women, that are gross on every level. There are a slew of other things \u2014 about rape, about the Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 that would make some immediately write him off. He believes, specifically with regard to comedy, that \u201cnothing is off-limits.\u201d\n\nThe difference between Glover and, say, Kanye West (who is completely outta control; these theories of performance art, while perhaps buyable, are stupid on his part) or Kendrick Lamar or any other number of black male artists who\u2019ve been elevated as creative stalwarts is that Glover\u2019s done it almost completely from the inside. He was a writer for the beloved 30 Rock, and then Tina Fey turned around and embarrassed everyone. He starred on Community, a show that, while not a ratings monster, was beloved by an interesting sect of America. You might recall that comedy legend Chevy Chase, whose character was noted for his \u201ccurmudgeonly racism,\u201d was booted off that program.\n\nFX\u2019s Atlanta speaks for itself in terms of impact, scope and influence, but the fact that he got such a plum gig at all is an indication of exactly how much Hollywood loves him. And that\u2019s before we even get to the Grammy nominations, his movies and his historic role as Lando Calrissian in the upcoming Solo: A Star Wars Story. Glover is an insider who\u2019s been allowed to influence within the real framework of the Hollywood system, as opposed to crash-landing as an outsider.\n\nWhich is important to take into consideration when we view \u201cThis Is America.\u201d Glover\u2019s been making content in many forms for years, and what the new song and video represent is a magnum opus-like culmination of all of that. The sequencing of the video alone is incredible. What the artist presents as chaos is less about being happenstance and random and more about being inevitable and ever-present. That\u2019s a reality that\u2019s hard to portray in such a short space of time. It\u2019s also scary.\n\nThe inevitability of destruction. The specific mimicry of deplorable stereotypes that call back to an era we try to forget. Watching him dance the Jim Crow dance is jarring and familiar, which is both equally bizarre and, again, frightening \u2014 the real scope of the black experience in this country. It replays over and over again on television, movies, the internet and, yes, music videos. Glover/Gambino is not exploiting as much as he\u2019s reminding us how well-woven all of it is into our consciousness. And, just like in a dream, where you\u2019re never really sure what\u2019s real and what\u2019s a perverse version of your brain creating a reality you don\u2019t know you can trust, this video makes you ask questions. How am I supposed to know what everything means if it\u2019s all free-flowing, dangerous and unstoppable? That\u2019s the reality of being black in this country in 2018.\n\nWe live in a nation where we have to create apps in order not to waste food. School administrators get violent with kids who are just looking to celebrate their educations. The Ku Klux Klan is legit making a comeback. Police officers are outfitting their cars with the words popo, so we can apparently feel better about fearing for our lives because the tormentors appear with a familiar name. Even with that being well-known, our generational trauma somehow allows us to make fun of the very specific way that we choose to kill each other. It\u2019s insane on every level.\n\nView this post on Instagram Facts A post shared by snoopdogg (@snoopdogg) on May 7, 2018 at 10:56am PDT\n\nWe\u2019ve got 4-year-olds who are adept at handling guns.\n\ni won\u2019t say it, but you know pic.twitter.com/l1vME9bYtI \u2014 Broderick Greer (@BroderickGreer) May 6, 2018\n\nThey do so in front of women appropriating cultures they don\u2019t respect. Yet, all the while, these presentations of Gambino\u2019s are somehow inspirational because it\u2019s all we\u2019ve ever had.\n\nThe final part of this video is the most harrowing because it\u2019s an indication of what I believe to be Glover\u2019s real message: that the capitulation to actual fear results in a flight response that only descendants of slaves can understand. While running for his life from what appears to be a mob of people, the look on his face says it all. Trying to escape in a dark hallway to nothing, the people are gaining on him. He appears to be losing steam but is determined not to stop. The examination of that inner feeling of helplessness that is so often the black experience is what\u2019s most important here. Glover taps into that sentiment in a way that\u2019s hard to grasp if you\u2019ve never lived it.\n\nI\u2019m instantly fearful of any form of black public expression that white people either identify as something they can\u2019t live without or pull away from.\n\nSure, we all know this is a barbaric and screwed-up place on many levels. But it\u2019s also a place where we\u2019ve found a way to thrive in the worst of conditions: shirtless, deliberate and composed. He can sing about staying woke and its importance of that until he\u2019s blue in the face, but \u201cThis Is America\u201d reminds us that the reality is actually scarier than the nightmare we\u2019ve been trapped in since we got here. Waking up might not get you anything but more pain, more despair and, thus, fewer years to enjoy the rights and privileges of life.\n\nThat is America. And that\u2019s exactly what it was created to be.", "description": "The night I watched Childish Gambino\u2019s video for \u201cThis Is America,\u201d I was scared.
