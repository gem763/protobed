But this year, the Maine Principals\u2019 Association reached an agreement to let him participate in the regional meet Saturday in Cumberland.\n\nThe Leavitt Area High School sophomore started the race with runners. Then he separated from them onto a modified course aimed at ensuring safety.\n\nThe Lewiston Sun Journal reports Schomaker finished his modified 1.8-mile course in just over 37 minutes, a few seconds before the final runners who ran the 5-kilometer course.\n\nSchomaker, who has cerebellar hypoplasia, has competed alongside runners this season and has even recorded a 7-minute mile.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A high school cross-country athlete who uses a wheelchair has completed his regional meet race, paving the way for him to compete in the state meet next weekend.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
