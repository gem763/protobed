Also included in the Act is the provision for disabled parking badges to make it easier for using car-parking facilities. It also empowered disabled war veterans by allowing them to challenge the terms of their pensions where there are, for example, errors in provisions.\n\n\n\nThere can be no better, or stark, example of a nation\u2019s desire to improve the welfare of its people than the treatment of both the mentally unwell and disabled. In, at least, one way a our progress over the last two to three centuries can be illustrated by our successes and failures to propose appropriate legislative response to our compassion on these issues, by creating frameworks of equal access and for, affordable, minimum treatment provisions.\n\n\n\nOn the different issue of the mentally ill, as opposed to the physical disabled, popular views that were initially imbued to the brim with prejudice, superstition and fear towards one\u2019s fellow man, were challenged by the humanity of using science and endeavour to understand the plight of the once so-called possessed, in order to make a claim for basic minimum treatment of decency. This has been part of a push for greater rights for the disabled.\n\n\n\nLord Morris\u2019s Act is a key part of this movement of slow, yet significant, legislative change for the vulnerable, whether physically or mentally disabled. It made significant inroads into equal access, from the Mental Health Act of 1959, (both instruments are markers for progress when one considers former aptly titled, in reflecting the views of the time, Lunacy Acts of 1845 and 1890).\n\n\n\nFrom a broader viewpoint Lord Morris\u2019 Act was ground breaking in ensuring the legislature reflected some progress towards ensuring that there was no gap between the current law and scientific progress in understanding and caring for the disabled.\n\n", "description": "ABHIJIT PANDYA: One of the first duties of man, beyond himself and his family, is to the welfare and improvement of common humanity.
