A workers\u2019 strike and a class boycott by thousands of students have extended demonstrations into the workweek.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Mrs. Lam had insisted her government can deal with the long-running protests. The chief executive also said she had never tendered her resignation and was committed to pulling the city out of the political crisis.\n\nMrs. Lam said she was disappointed that comments she made at a recent closed-door meeting with businesspeople\u2014in which she lamented the difficulties of serving both the central government and the people of Hong Kong\u2014had been leaked.\n\nA rally to boycott classes at the Chinese University of Hong Kong was held Monday.

Chinese officials floated a slate of detailed measures for a crackdown, including raising the idea of outlawing masks for Hong Kong protesters and saying that teachers who encouraged students to protest must be punished for their \u201cheinous crime.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you think China will face repercussions over their handling of the protests in Hong Kong? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nPatriotic education must be introduced into Hong Kong schools, said Xu Luying, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. An effort to introduce patriotic education in 2012 triggered mass street protests that galvanized a new generation of young political activists who are prominent in this summer\u2019s uprising.\n\nThe comments from the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council were the first time officials had mentioned unilateral intervention and raise questions about how much autonomy Hong Kong\u2019s government has.\n\nUnder \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d Hong Kong was promised 50 years of no change and more freedoms than mainland Chinese citizens enjoy, until 2047. The protests this summer were sparked by fear of Beijing\u2019s increasing reach, as residents took to the streets to oppose a law that would have allowed local suspects to be tried under the mainland\u2019s opaque judicial system. Protesters\u2019 demands have since broadened to include greater democracy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wrong notion that the deployment of the People\u2019s Liberation Army in Hong Kong would be the end of one country, two systems,\u201d Ms. Xu said at the briefing in Beijing. \u201cHong Kong\u2019s Basic Law allows for Hong Kong to request help or for the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress to declare a state of emergency.\u201d\n\nVictor Gao, an interpreter for former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, said the latter stipulation of the Basic Law means Beijing can intervene unilaterally without Mrs. Lam\u2019s request, but that they are still giving her a chance first.\n\nMr. Gao, who is no longer serving in government, said he believed that if Beijing intervenes, it will be with police officers or other methods, not with the PLA.\n\nIn a sign of Beijing\u2019s concerns over the optics of cracking down on students, Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macau affairs office, harshly criticized \u201cseparatists\u201d Tuesday for turning teenagers into \u201cfoot soldiers and pawns\u201d in Hong Kong.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Mrs. Lam renewed her commitment to staying in her position after the Reuters news agency reported a day earlier that she had told a meeting of business leaders that her role in the continuing unrest was unforgivable and that she would quit if she had the choice.\n\nMrs. Lam said her words, spoken in a private capacity, reflected her musings rather than reality, and she maintained that she had never tendered her resignation. In an audio recording of her remarks released by Reuters, Mrs. Lam can be heard lamenting the precarious nature of being a chief executive.\n\nEarlier Hong Kong police dispersed demonstrators with tear gas and water cannons laced with blue dye as tens of thousands showed up to rally despite a police ban.

She added that the situation was more difficult to address locally because it had been elevated to a national level with regards to sovereignty and security.\n\nThe leaked audio recording puts forth the idea that the local government is no longer governing Hong Kong in an autonomous manner, said Ho-Fung Hung, a political economy professor at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIt turns from open secret to official knowledge that Beijing is masterminding the response to the protest,\u201d he said.\n\nIn recent weeks, Mrs. Lam said she would start a dialogue with people from all backgrounds and political platforms, though she hasn\u2019t met any key figures from the opposition movement.\n\n\u201cHong Kong needs constructive dialogue badly,\u201d said Mr. Yang, the government spokesman in Beijing. He said Beijing supports Mrs. Lam\u2019s talks with Hong Kongers, adding that he hoped discussion could turn \u201crage into harmony.\u201d\n\nBeijing policy experts have also been floating possible changes to Hong Kong\u2019s political system that would put more centralized power in the hands of the city\u2019s executive chief. Such changes would almost certainly face intense public resistance in Hong Kong.\n\nThe city is entering a fourth month of social upheaval sparked by protests over a bill that Mrs. Lam proposed. Mass protests and, in recent weeks, near daily clashes between hard-core protesters and police have occurred in the city\u2019s streets and subway stations. Protesters have a slate of demands including democratic changes and an independent inquiry into how police have handled the demonstrations.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s news conference in Beijing, spokeswoman Ms. Xu said that Hong Kong schoolteachers who encouraged students to protest had lost their decency and must be punished to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nThousands of high school and university students are participating in their second day of class boycotts in Hong Kong. The government\u2019s proposal to introduce patriotic education in Hong Kong in 2012 is often cited by young activists as the moment of their political awakening. Amid protests at the time, the measures were never introduced.\n\nWrite to Natasha Khan at natasha.khan@wsj.com and Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.com", "description": "China\u2019s top office for Hong Kong affairs laid out specific measures for the city\u2019s leader to address long-running protests.
