Having civil disagreements may seem impossible. But it isn\u2019t.\n\nIf we want to find solutions, it\u2019s vital that we learn how to disagree thoughtfully.\n\nBelow are three shareable videos offering simple tips for disagreeing better.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6_KAznoAs Copy Link\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOEkLcdhhn8 Copy Link\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnFfAFpRUCI Copy Link\n\nThese days, arguments can become a destructive land-grab for social media points, and quickly hit a dead end. At the moment, people are ready to pounce on anyone they deem \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\nAnd someone is definitely wrong on the internet right now. Some of them are wrong in your social media feeds, and there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re already friends with at least one such person. We get things wrong all the time.\n\nSo what do we do when we decide someone\u2019s wrong? Engage \u2014 or not? Disagree loudly \u2014 or roll our eyes silently? Block them, or troll them?\n\nA better option would be to make an impossible conversation possible through the techniques above.\n\nResearch confirms that central to influencing \u2014 or just productively engaging with \u2014 other humans is a sense of psychological safety. Letting friends (or strangers on the internet) who hold beliefs that you think are wrong know that you\u2019re still friends (or still just strangers on the internet, not mortal enemies) reinforces that safety.\n\nPeter Boghossian (@peterboghossian) is an assistant professor of philosophy at Portland State University.
