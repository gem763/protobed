Police attended the property, based off-campus near to the University of Radford campus in Virginia, where Cutting (pictured right) immediately admitted to Cannon's (pictured left) murder when they arrived\n\nLuisa Cutting, pictured left, stabbed Alexa Cannon, pictured right, 30 times with a butcher knife. The 21-year-old student will serve 20 years in prison and is ordered to undergo mental health treatment\n\nLuisa, pictured right, claimed through her defense attorney that she suffered a psychotic episode before she attacked Cannon (pictured left). She blamed the amount of different substances she had taken that night. Police found cocaine, marijuana, psilocybin mushrooms, Adderall and Xanax in her system.\n\nShe also tried to shove her hand in her mouth, according to the New York Post. This behaviour concerned police so they committed her to a mental health facility for a week.\n\nDuring a search of the property, police found drug paraphernalia and what was described by the Roanaoke Times as a brown, chalk-like substance.\n\nCutting's attorney said that she experienced a 'psychotic episode' due to the amount of different drugs she had taken.\n\nLuisa Cutting, pictured left, was the president of the Latinos Student Alliance at Radford University. The family of Alexa Cannon, pictured right, said that she managed her epilepsy courageously and loved music and the arts\n\nThe police were unable to identify a motive for the murder but Cutting's (pictured right) defense lawyer said it was a psychotic episode that caused her to kill her best friend Cannon (pictured left)\n\n'There are no words for this tragedy and my heart is filled with sorrow and grief. \u2026 I am so, so sorry,' Cutting said during the trial. She sought forgiveness and apologized to Cannon's family.\n\nThe stabbing happened in an apartment the pair, who were friends before moving in together, shared off-campus on the 1200 block of Clement Street. Officers attended the scene after neighbours complained of arguing and screaming at 07:45 am.\n\nThe 21-year-old met the police at the door and said she'd killed her friend. Authorities said they never discovered a motive for the fierce attack.\n\nAt a memorial service in January, friends and relatives said that Cannon managed her epilepsy courageously and that she loved music and art.\n\nCutting sought forgiveness from the victim's family saying: 'my heart is filled with sorrow and grief. \u2026 I am so, so sorry.'
