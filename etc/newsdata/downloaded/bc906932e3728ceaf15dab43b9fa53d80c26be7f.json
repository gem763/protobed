That\u2019s a pretty great silver lining. Variety reports that, due to scheduling conflicts with The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Elisabeth Moss had to drop out of Jane Campion\u2019s adaptation of Power of a Dog, but Dunst will be taking the role in her absence. Based on a book by Thomas Savage, the story follows a pair of rich brothers, played Paul Dano and Benedict Cumberbatch, who own the biggest ranch in the Montana valley. Dano\u2019s character, the nice one, secretly marries a local widow (Dunst), which leads Cumberbatch\u2019s cruel character to wage a \u201csadistic, relentless war to destroy her.\u201d Whoa! That seems like an extreme reaction, but widow and secret wife seems like a great fit for Dunst, an extremely versatile talent. And, not for nothing, a top-quality Instagram user.", "description": "Elisabeth Moss has to leave her role in Jane Campion\u2019s The Power of a  Dog due to commitments with The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, but Kirsten Dunst will take over the role.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/29/29-kirsten-dunst.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
