You can\u2019t just call as you feel like it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDillon added that all calls have to be made on speakerphone and text messages were a huge no-no.\n\nDillon (middle) revealed how The Apprentice candidates are banned from using phones (Picture: Dillon St Paul)\n\n\u2018If it doesn\u2019t happen on camera it didn\u2019t happen,\u2019 he said.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted The Apprentice for comment.\n\nLord Alan Sugar is currently seeking his next business partner with the help of Karren Brady and Claude Littner with the show airing its 15th series.\n\nThere\u2019s already been a load of drama behind-the-scenes too, with ex-contestant Kenna Ngoma revealing to us that the candidates\u2019 WhatsApp group was \u2018shutdown\u2019 by the show\u2019s bosses after Lottie Lion\u2019s \u2018racist\u2019 message was revealed to the public.\n\n\u2018We just weren\u2019t allowed to be honest,\u2019 Kenna said.\n\n\u2018We were being naughty to be honest. It\u2019s fine [for us] to interact on social media, so we all just agreed to stay in contact on there.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018You can see on social media we\u2019re always supporting each other, liking each other\u2019s tweets, commenting. I\u2019m friends with most of them.\u2019\n\nThe Apprentice airs Wednesdays at 9pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
