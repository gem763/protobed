The Rams and Chargers are in a league that ignored Los Angeles for a couple of decades, lost a couple of generations of fans, and it\u2019s going to take time to win them back. The Kings\u2019 following is passionate but not massive (same with the two MLS teams in town).\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Lakers are the team that fathers take their sons to see, like their fathers did before them. The Lakers have won 16 NBA titles\u2026\n\nAbout that, it\u2019s really 11 in Los Angeles. The first five carried over from Minnesota (where the name Lakers makes more sense). That kind of bothers\u2019 Clippers coach Doc Rivers, something he told Marc Spears of The Undefeated in a story previewing the Clippers\u2019 season.\n\n\u201cIt is a Lakers town. I\u2019m good with that. I have no issues with that,\u201d Clippers head coach Doc Rivers told The Undefeated from his Staples Center office recently. \u201cThey have how many titles that they\u2019ve won here? You know, they claim them all, but they only won a certain amount here. I will say that. That actually bugs me a little bit. \u2026 Having said that, that\u2019s generations of loyalty. \u201cI look at us as, we\u2019re creating our own movement. \u2026 We\u2019re not trying to take away shine from the other. We\u2019ve got our own thing going. I never thought we could get our own thing going. That was what I was so frustrated with being here. And now we got our own thing going.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nCarrying titles over is common\u2026 and controversial. Should the Dodgers be able to count Brooklyn titles? It feels wrong to think Oklahoma City could count Seattle\u2019s titles. Should Sacramento be able to count the 1951 Rochester title? Personally, the Lakers carrying Minnesota\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem a big issue, but you know Rivers is going to take a shot at the Lakers when he can.\n\nThat hallway rivalry at Staples Center is building.\n\nFew things seem to irritate Lakers fans like the Clippers putting posters of players over the Lakers\u2019 title banners at Staples Center for Clippers home games. Lakers fans think of Staples as their building \u2014 and it might not exist but for the draw of the Shaq/Kobe Lakers. However, Staples is owned by AEG (whose primary owner is Philip Anschutz, who owns the NHL\u2019s Kings), not the Lakers. It\u2019s a hockey building.\n\nDoc is right about one thing: The Clippers have their own thing going.\n\nThe Clippers, on paper, are the better Los Angeles team and better built for the playoffs with versatile wings such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. The Clippers have more trusted depth with Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell. Tuesday night\u2019s Clippers\u2019 home opener will go how it goes \u2014 LeBron James and Anthony Davis will go for the Lakers, Paul George is out for weeks still for the Clippers \u2014 but a playoff battle between these teams this season could be epic.\n\nAnd decide who gets to hang the next banner in Staples Center.", "description": "The Los Angeles Lakers count the five championships of the Minneapolis Lakers among their 16 titles.", "authors": ["Kurt Helin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cZJBSNNqqFy58YWaP3FggQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9VXh2y3MSbf7o1.ElX7W2g--~B/aD00MzI7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/301be48d0e031e58423b41e396d0c2f4", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
