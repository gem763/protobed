The decision will be announced at 2 p.m. in Washington with Powell facing reporters 30 minutes later.\n\nare pricing a 90% likelihood of a cut though economists surveyed by Bloomberg put the odds at 75%, betraying a bit more doubt that reflects divisions on the committee about the need to lower borrowing costs much further. While policy makers all see risks from trade uncertainty and weakness abroad, some view the Fed\u2019s reductions in July and September as already sufficient to offset those headwinds absent additional shocks.\n\nPowell will likely use his press conference to communicate that message of a pause while emphasizing flexibility if the economic outlook shifts significantly.\n\n\u201cWhat they want to provide is a hawkish cut,\u2019\u2019 said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist with Northern Trust (NASDAQ: ) Co. in Chicago and a former Fed researcher. \u201cExpressing that properly will require some deft expression, which the Fed hasn\u2019t always been able to provide.\u2019\u2019\n\nPowell is following the playbook of a mentor, Alan Greenspan, who cut rates three times in midcycle adjustments in 1995-1996 and in 1998 to counter risks. September forecasts showed the FOMC saw interest rates hitting bottom this year before rising slightly in 2021.\n\nInvestors are slightly more dovish and have fully priced in another quarter point cut by mid-2020. The Fed will update its quarterly forecasts in December.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economists Say\n\n\u201cBloomberg Economics expects officials to adopt a \u201cmeeting-by-meeting\u201d approach to evaluating the need for additional stimulus, so as to appease hawkish-leaning members of the committee. However, from meeting-to-meeting in a slow growth, low inflation environment, officials will see greater need to provide additional support.\u201d\n\n-- Carl Riccadonna, Yelena Shulyatyeva, Andrew Husby and Eliza Winger (Click here to read full article)\n\nThe FOMC is divided between policy makers who favor insurance against risks from a manufacturing slump, the trade war with China, Brexit and slower global growth, versus those who see domestic data largely supporting their outlook for solid growth.\n\nThe latter camp includes Kansas City Fed\u2019s Esther George and Boston\u2019s Eric Rosengren, both likely to dissent again if the Fed cuts rates on Wednesday. They have some company: The Fed\u2019s September dot plot of interest rate projections showed five officials didn\u2019t favor the cut delivered at that meeting and another five who saw no need for another cut this year.\n\nThat creates the possibility of a surprise, and economists put 20% odds that the FOMC will decide not to cut Wednesday. Any pause would also certainly be opposed by President Donald Trump, who\u2019s pushed publicly for lower rates to rev up the economy.\n\n\u201cThis meeting will be very contentious,\u2019\u2019 said Jonathan Wright, economics professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who previously worked at the Fed. \u201cThe overall data since the last meeting aren\u2019t that negative, and a lot of FOMC participants, mostly nonvoting, will be unconvinced of the wisdom of cutting again.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe last time the Fed reduced rates three times while the economy was growing was in 1998. After the third cut, it sent a strong signal it was done, announcing that financial conditions following 75 basis points of easing \u201ccan reasonably be expected\u201d to sustain the expansion.\n\nWednesday\u2019s statement might also suggest \u201cwe have done enough,\u2019\u2019 said Stephen Stanley, Amherst Pierpont chief economist. \u201cIf they ease and want to send a pause signal, it will be up to Powell to flesh it out.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe FOMC may consider tweaking its assessment of current conditions to slightly weaker wording, noting that the job creation has eased and inflation expectations have moderated, said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist with Stifel Nicolaus in Chicago.\n\nOne concern Fed officials may have with too strong of a pause signal is that it could flatten the Treasury yield curve, and an inverted yield curve -- where short term rates are higher than long-term ones -- is traditionally viewed as a recession warning that could alarm investors.\n\n\u201cThe market is likely to increasingly question the Fed\u2019s resolve to prop up a faltering economy which could translate into lower rates on the longer end, perpetuating the need for further Fed action to stabilize the shape of the yield curve,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nThe central bank was not seen making much news on its balance sheet following an Oct. 11 announcement it would buy Treasury bills at an initial $60 billion a month pace to lift bank reserves in the system. The Fed has repeatedly called the measure, undertaken after sharp spikes in overnight money market rates, a technical step that did not alter the stance of monetary policy.", "description": "Fed Prepares to Pause After Third Rate Cut: Decision Day Guide", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pica2387c71f6e9fd41b991bc0922a92b8b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
