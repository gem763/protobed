Our repeated efforts to arrange interviews with young, wealthy Swedes proved tricky; off-the-record, people were happy to talk about large second homes, family yachts, sports cars or champagne sprees in nightclubs, but getting them to formalise their comments was a struggle.\n\n\u201cI have a feeling that it will come across as bragging, which unfortunately I don\u2019t feel comfortable with,\u201d read one text message that seemed representative of the sentiment felt by many.
