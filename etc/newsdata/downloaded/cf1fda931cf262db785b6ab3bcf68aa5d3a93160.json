Now comes a renewed interest in the \u201cDeep State\u201d \u2014 the idea that a shadow government is in place to counter Mr. Trump\u2019s every move and neutralize his positive accomplishments.\n\nIndeed, White House senior adviser Stephen Miller told Fox News that the whistleblower in the Ukraine matter is a \u201cdeep state operative.\u201d\n\nEarlier, The New Yorker claimed that \u201cthe whistle-blower complaint is democracy at work, not the deep state.\u201d CNN framed the match as \u201cthe whistleblower vs. Trump\u2019s deep state,\u201d while The Atlantic offered an overview of \u201cthe not-so deep state.\u201d\n\nThe deep state was a factor even before President Trump took the presidential oath on Jan. 20, 2017. Consider that veteran political commentator Bill Moyers suggested that Hillary Clinton offer her own inaugural address at that pivotal time, advising Democrats to \u201cprepare by joining together as a movement and creating the constituency of what will be, in effect, a shadow government.\u201d\n\nOn Inauguration Day itself, GQ magazine advised,\u201dBarack Obama is preparing for his third term.\u201d\n\nNow comes a new Economist/YouGov survey which asks this question: \u201cDo you think the \u2018deep state\u2019 is working to overthrow President Trump?\u201d\n\nThe findings: 35% of Americans says yes. That includes 69% of Republicans, 31% of independents and 15% of Democrats. Another 34% are \u201cunsure\u201d if the deep state is at work; 17% of Republicans, 42% of independents and 38% of Democrats agree. The survey revels that 31% say the deep state is not at work, including 14% of Republicans, 27% of independents and 47% of Democrats.\n\nPOLL NUMBERS STILL WITH TRUMP\n\nThe Trump impeachment investigation/inquiry/media joyride is complicated. There are some telling new poll numbers though.\n\n\u201cVoter still see President Trump\u2019s reelection as a surer shot than impeachment,\u201d says a new Rasmussen Reports survey which finds that a near majority \u2014 46% of all voters \u2014 think it\u2019s more likely that Mr. Trump will be reelected in 2020 than defeated by the Democratic nominee or impeached; 80% of Republicans, 43% of independents and a surprising 19% of Democrats agree.\n\nOnly 28% see a win by the Democrats\u2019 candidate as more likely, down from 33% two months ago. The survey of 1,000 Likely U.S. voters was conducted on September 25-26.\n\nANOTHER IMPEACHMENT WARNING FOR DEMOCRATS\n\nNew York Times columnist David Brooks has this to say about the possible impeachment of President Trump.\n\n\u201cThis political brawl will leave Trump victorious. This is completely elitist. We\u2019re in the middle of an election campaign. If Democrats proceed with the impeachment process, it will happen amid candidate debates, primaries and caucuses. Elections give millions and millions of Americans a voice in selecting the president. This process gives 100 mostly millionaire senators a voice in selecting the president,\u201d Mr. Brooks writes.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is no longer a rare and grave crisis in American life; it\u2019s becoming a device parties use when the House and the presidency are in the hands of different parties. Democratic House members have already introduced impeachment articles against Trump on at least four occasions. It\u2019s just another partisan thing,\u201d Mr. Brooks notes.\n\nHUNTING AND FISHING, TRUMP STYLE\n\n\u201cSince our nation\u2019s earliest days, hunting and fishing have remained enduring pastimes that are inextricably linked to the American experience. Today, hunters and anglers of all ages carry on these traditions in the spirit of rugged individualism to provide for their families and to show the next generation of Americans the splendor of the great outdoors. On National Hunting and Fishing Day, we celebrate their stewardship of the natural world, their contributions to our thriving economy, and America\u2019s abundant natural resources and beauty.\u201d\n\nSo says President Trump, in his official proclamation recognizing National Hunting and Fishing Day, which was Saturday, that honors 46 million U.S. hunters and anglers, who spend $70 billion a year on equipment and other expenses.\n\nHOLA SENOR PRESIDENTE\n\nPervious analysis has suggested that conservative values have considerable appeal for Hispanic voters, many of whom embrace faith and are pro-life. There\u2019s more data, though.\n\n\u201cA Census Bureau report released this month reiterates what we already know, which is that Hispanics have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the economy under President Trump. Both the president and Republicans in Congress should leverage this critical Hispanic economic success to maximize their chances of winning\u201d writes Daniel Ortiz, president of the Job Creators network, in an essay in The Hill.\n\nHispanic median income reached a record high in 2018. The poverty rate for Hispanics fell to a record low of 17.6%. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that Hispanic wages grew by 3.3% over the last year, unemployment rate is at a record low 4.2%, Mr. Ortiz notes. The economy is the most important issue to the demographic, says Mr. Ortiz.\n\n\u201cHispanics are the most religious demographic in the country, with about five in six Hispanics identifying as Christian. That means Democratic support of late term abortions and progressive gender theories will turn off at least some potential Hispanic voters in the election,\u201d says Mr. Ortiz, who advises the GOP to court this voting bloc.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 48% of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court; 71% of Republicans, 42% of independents and 40% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 36% overall say the \u201cpolitical viewpoint\u201d of the court is conservative; 27% of Republicans, 28% of independents and 53% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 29% say it is moderate; 41% of Republicans, 29% of independents and 20% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 22% are unsure; 14% of Republicans, 31% of independents and 16% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 13% say the court is liberal; 18% of Republicans, 13% of independents and 11% of Democrats agree.\n\nSource: An Economist/YouGov poll of 1,500 U.S. adults conducted Sept. 22-24.\n\n\u2022 Helpful information to [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
