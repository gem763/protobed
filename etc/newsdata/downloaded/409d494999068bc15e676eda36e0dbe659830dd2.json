Still, she said, \"compared to 2C, 2B has a very low penetration in China and strong growth potential.\"\n\nTencent said it has chalked up some recent wins with contracts from the Bank of Communications Co Ltd (SS: ) (HK: ) as well as local governments.\n\nHowever, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (N: ) continues to dominate with 43% of China's cloud market, according to data from market researcher Canalys. That is more than the combined share of Tencent, Amazon.com Inc (O: ) and Baidu Inc (O: ), the next three largest players.\n\nTong said industries Tencent is targeting include mobility, fitness and finance. He said the firm is also expanding its cloud business internationally and seeking partners in South Korea and Southeast Asia to offer cloud-based games.\n\nTencent has also started helping customers of Alphabet Inc's (O: ) Google Cloud, which is not available in China, with services that offer \"seamless connections\" between clouds, though Tong said there was no formal or exclusive arrangement.\n\nTong declined to comment on growth targets for his business unit, whose financial results form part of Tencent's FinTech and Business Services category. That segment generated 22.9 billion yuan (\u00a32.57 billion) in revenue in the second quarter of 2019, up 37% from the same period a year earlier and accounting for just over 25% of the firm's quarterly total, showed Tencent's latest earnings report.\n\nTong said mistakes would be made and patience needed as Tencent increases its attention on serving businesses, given that many of its internal procedures were designed for the consumer business. Consumer-oriented companies have traditionally struggled to compete in corporate computing.\n\n\"Many of the things we are doing will take a relatively longer time,\" Tong said. \"It's not like we're selling a small product that needs quick decisions. This business needs a longer runway.\"", "description": "Cloud and clear: Tencent draws on gaming tech to lift B2B cloud ambitions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8J0B0_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
