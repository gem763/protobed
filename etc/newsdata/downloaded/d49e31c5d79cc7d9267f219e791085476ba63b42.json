Johnson and Corbyn met on Wednesday morning to see if they could agree on a way to press on with the \u201cpaused\u201d bill under revised timings.\n\nCorbyn was accompanied by his key adviser Seumas Milne, and Johnson by Dominic Cummings, as well as the two parties\u2019 respective chief whips. The meeting took place in the prime minister\u2019s office in the House of Commons.\n\nWill the EU agree to extend Brexit beyond 31 October? Read more\n\nBut both sides said little was achieved. Asked if Johnson seemed to think there was a possibility of agreeing a new timetable, Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cHe certainly didn\u2019t lean in that direction, but he didn\u2019t rule it out.\u201d\n\nA Downing Street source was more blunt when asked if the process would resume: \u201cI do not expect any further talks.\u201d\n\nThe source strongly indicated that Johnson would now seek an election, even though it is not in his gift, as Labour would be needed to back a vote under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act to deliver the two-thirds majority needed for an election earlier than the five-year cycle.\n\n\u201cAny time that parliament gets a vote for delay it will always choose delay,\u201d the source said. \u201cTherefore, if this parliament is unwilling to vote for a deal, we will have to go for a general election.\u201d This could happen before Christmas, they added.\n\nHowever, this does not mean this is definitely Johnson\u2019s position. Before the vote on the timetabling motion on Tuesday evening, the PM said he was likely to pull the entire bill and seek an election if he lost the vote, but did not subsequently do so.\n\nWhile Labour\u2019s official position is that it will back an immediate election as soon as no-deal is ruled out, a number of the party\u2019s MPs are wary and would prefer to push for a referendum on a Brexit deal instead.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s spokesman repeatedly refused to say whether Labour would vote for an election if the EU agreed a delay until 31 January.\n\n\u201cExactly how the extension is made, and how it\u2019s communicated and what the legal status is, will determine whether we consider [no deal] taken off the table, and the risk of a crash-out there or not,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the threat of a no-deal crash-out is off the table, and that is clear and guaranteed, then of course we would support an election.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman declined to say what further guarantees would be sought on preventing no deal, saying only: \u201cWe need to wait and see what they will come up with.\u201d\n\nThe lack of progress was shown earlier during prime minister\u2019s questions, at which Corbyn called for the government to give parliament \u201cthe necessary time to improve on this worse-than-terrible treaty\u201d. In response, Johnson accused Labour of seeking to scupper Brexit.\n\nCorbyn used all his questions at PMQs to ask Johnson about elements of the bill, including standards for environmental, consumer and workers\u2019 rights, and the continued inclusion of Northern Ireland in elements of the EU\u2019s customs union.\n\nAfter Johnson incorrectly said there would be \u201cno checks between Northern Ireland and GB [Great Britain]\u201d, Corbyn accused him of having not properly read his own bill.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister unlawfully prorogued parliament; he said he would refuse to comply with [the] law; he threw Northern Ireland under a bus; he ripped up protections for workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections; lost every vote along the way; and tried to prevent genuine, democratic scrutiny and debate,\u201d the Labour leader said.\n\n\u201cEven worse than that \u2013 he\u2019s not that familiar with it.\u201d", "description": "PM and Labour leader meet but do not agree timetable for withdrawal agreement bill", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Peter Walker", "The Civil Servant"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/611a482f334f10f9946e6992db71c28a42a951fc/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e32140b9648857f075133aad91f94ddf", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
