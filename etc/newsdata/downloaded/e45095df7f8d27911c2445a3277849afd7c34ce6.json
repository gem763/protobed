Morgan said arrests increased 88 percent during the 2019 fiscal year, calling it a \u201cstaggering\u201d increase.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese are numbers no immigration system in the world is designed to handle,\u201d he said.\n\nArrests by U.S. border agents reached an all-time high of 1.6 million in 2000, but Department of Homeland Security officials insist that the migration wave they faced this year is unlike anything in the past.\n\nA generation ago, most of the migrants crossing the border illegally were single adults from Mexico who could be quickly processed and deported.\n\nThis year, Central American parents with children became the overwhelming majority of border crossers. Instead of seeking to evade capture, many sought out U.S. agents to surrender and stated a fear of being sent home, the first step in seeking asylum or another form of legal protection in the United States.\n\nAD\n\nCourt limits on the amount of time minors can be held in CBP custody mean that nearly any parent who arrived with a child could expect to be issued a notice to appear in court and to be released into the U.S. interior within a few days.\n\nAD\n\nHomeland security officials said smuggling organizations have been reaping huge profits by exploiting this \u201cloophole,\u201d reaping huge profits by marketing an easy trip north.\n\nThe surge reached its height in May, when more than 144,000 were taken into custody, including one group of 1,036 that crossed the border into El Paso to surrender.\n\nAfter that event, President Trump demanded a crackdown, threatening to impose tariffs on Mexican imports if Mexican authorities did not help to stem the tide.\n\nAD\n\nThe government of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador responded by deploying thousands of national guard troops to clamp down on the Central American migrants, while also allowing the United States to expand a program that requires migrants to wait outside U.S. territory while their legal claims are processed.\n\nUnder that program, which the Trump administration calls the \u201cMigrant Protection Protocols,\u201d nearly 50,000 migrants have been returned to Mexico, many of them waiting months in dangerous border cities. Trump officials say the program has been effective at deterring migrants who may be trying to game the system with baseless asylum claims.\n\nAD\n\nThe legality of MPP is being challenged in federal courts \u2014 a federal appeals court allowed it to continue while weighing its legality \u2014 as well as a new policy that disqualifies asylum seekers who do not attempt to gain protection in other nations while en route to the U.S. border.\n\nAdvocates for migrants say the Trump administration has all but slammed the door on migrants fleeing violence and persecution, exposing children and other vulnerable populations to grave risks.\n\nAD", "description": "Arrests at the U.S. southern border continued to decline in September, according to latest U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.", "authors": ["Nick Miroff", "Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XcTba-C9EX0q-pFdENbfcpyssWQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FZ2BPKGQ7II6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
