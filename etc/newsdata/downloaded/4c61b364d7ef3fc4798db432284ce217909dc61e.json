Why David Hasselhoff remains an icon for German unity", "language": "en", "text": "At his recent Berlin concert, the Hoff once again recalled his part in the fall of the Wall. His obsession with reunification is gauche \u2013 but his message of hope is still necessary\n\nFreedom! Freedom! Freedom!\u201d David Hasselhoff chants as he snakes his way through the Max-Schmeling-Halle, a basketball stadium erected near where a section of the Berlin Wall once stood. It\u2019s German Unity Day, Thursday 3 October, and Hasselhoff is here to promote his 14th album Open Your Eyes. The date is no coincidence.\n\nAs the show begins, the actor and singer is raised on a hydraulic platform above the crowd, and it\u2019s hard not to recall how, on New Year\u2019s Eve 1989 \u2013 less than two months after the Wall fell \u2013 he was similarly lifted beside the city\u2019s Brandenburg Gate in a bucket crane. \u201cThirty years of freedom!\u201d Hasselhoff yells today, adding, in a nod to John F Kennedy\u2019s 1963 speech, \u201cIch bin ein Berliner!\u201d\n\nOn that December night almost 30 years ago, in a televised performance that never seems far from his mind, Hasselhoff sang Looking for Freedom, a song that held West Germany\u2019s No 1 slot for two months during the tumultuous summer that led to the momentous East-West reunion. As the Knight Rider star mugged for the camera, Germans from both sides of the border sat astride the hated barricade. Some tossed fireworks dangerously close to Hasselhoff, his leather jacket illuminated by the sparks. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for freedom,\u201d he insisted, over and over again, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking so long.\u201d\n\nHasselhoff was still clinging to his anthem the last time I saw him, grinning beneath his trademark coiffure at Berlin\u2019s East Side Gallery. It was March 2013 and he was protesting developers\u2019 intentions to dismantle some of the open-air gallery, which consists of murals on a stretch of the Wall, singing the song a cappella \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 through a PA strapped to a battered yellow van\u00ad. This was a campaign to which he\u2019d stay loyal: in December 2017, he called again on the city\u2019s mayor to halt construction of luxury flats on what was once the \u201cdeath strip\u201d alongside the River Spree. (Nonetheless, the building went ahead.) For many, this provoked amusement, as Hasselhoff\u2019s actions often do. Most famous in Germany for a kitsch celebration of the Wall\u2019s demolition, he was now battling to keep it standing.\n\nTo justify his presence at Max-Schmeling-Halle tonight \u2013 as if it needs justification \u2013 Hasselhoff offers his resum\u00e9 before the show. Songs from the new album, as well as his hits, play over the PA while most people are still coming through the doors. A replica of KITT, his talking-car co-star, stands behind the sound desk, and clips of Knight Rider and Baywatch \u2013 as well as videos for his many German pop hits \u2013 are beamed behind the stage before his show gets under way.\n\nThen for the best part of three hours, he hammers out, with almost unceasing force, a series of cover versions that makes as little sense as his German fame does to the British. An improbably convincing cover of the Jesus and Mary Chain\u2019s Head On is followed by one of Modern English\u2019s I Melt With You. He perches on a stool for Glen Campbell\u2019s Rhinestone Cowboy, then vigorously owns the pomp of Open Your Eyes by gothic rockers Lords of the New Church. He dons his Baywatch uniform, wielding an inflatable buoy, for theme tune I\u2019m Always Here, then continues with a Rat Pack standard. When he lifts his shirt to reveal a back tattoo of his own face and the legend \u201cDon\u2019t Hassle the Hoff\u201d, the crowd\u2019s squeals are punctuated with disbelieving splutters.\n\nHe also offers constant, gushing reminders that we\u2019re commemorating \u201cThirty years! Thirty years of freedom!\u201d, something he seems to be taking more seriously than Berliners, for whom time has passed as fast as rents have risen. Memories of the Wall have been chipped away at, just as the edifice itself was, before it was then sold in fragments to tourists. These days Berlin celebrates this annual public holiday mostly for the simple reason that it\u2019s one of only nine granted to the city. (Bavaria, in contrast, has 13.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Hasselhoff in his Baywatch heyday.

Hasselhoff makes no mention of such issues.\n\nIn fact, Hasselhoff doesn\u2019t seem to have moved on at all, something reflected in his music. This is what provokes his critics as much as his enthusiasts: to some he\u2019s an embarrassing, outdated reminder of the profligate, superficial nature of much of western culture, while to others he\u2019s emblematic of a coveted future and a goal achieved. He\u2019s a symbol of unresolved conflicts, something with which Berlin is familiar.\n\nAs a globally recognisable star of huge shows \u2013 in 2011 Guinness World Records named him \u201cthe most watched man on TV\u201d \u2013 he also provokes snobbery from those who consider themselves more cerebral, although it was he who recognised Baywatch\u2019s commercial potential and invested his own money in the series when it was prematurely cancelled after its first season. He\u2019s been releasing critically derided albums since 1985, some of which have nonetheless hit the top spots in Austria and Switzerland as well as Germany \u2013 even 2013\u2019s A Real Good Feeling made the latter\u2019s Top 30 \u2013 but prominent roles in musicals like Chicago, Jekyll & Hyde and The Producers, for which he was personally selected by Mel Brooks, have done little to restore his credibility.\n\nFew, though, are as earnest about Hasselhoff\u2019s work as he is, and this includes his fans. During an unnecessary \u2013 and lengthy \u2013 interval, I ask two of them whether they take him seriously. Their response is amusingly ambivalent, and when I query whether he takes himself seriously, their reply is equally equivocal. \u201cProbably,\u201d they reply, adding, \u201chopefully not.\u201d This, of course, suits a man who sometimes betrays an unusual self-awareness, as appearances in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (in which he plays the German team\u2019s coach) and the droll mockumentary Hoff the Record \u2013 not to mention Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! \u2013 attest. In February this year, he published an audiobook, Up Against The Wall \u2013 set, of course, in autumn 1989 \u2013 in which he juggles performing to 100,000 people and saving Berlin from nuclear attack with the help of a doppelg\u00e4nger CIA agent stationed in east Berlin. \u201cIs this the greatest thing you can ever listen to?\u201d one reader asks on Goodreads. \u201cI\u2019m saying, \u2018Probably\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut at other times he appears to be the only person not in on the joke. When he tears into True Survivor (the theme tune to cult Swedish time-travel-martial-arts-action-comedy Kung Fury, a short film in which he had a cameo role as \u201cHoff 9000\u201d), it\u2019s so beefed up it sounds like an immaculate parody of 80s hair-synth-rock. He plays it straight, and it\u2019s this inappropriate sincerity that makes him an easy object of derision.\n\nBut his fans are conscious of his absurdity and some, at least, are protective of Looking for Freedom. One local friend, who grew up in the 80s, explained to me that, back then, Hasselhoff and his biggest hit represented \u201cthe sehnsucht [wistful longing] for western culture and the weird word \u2018freedom\u2019, embodied in a two-metre-tall, leather-clad, chest-haired dude \u2013 and, more importantly, a very catchy song that every kid was singing in school\u201d. Explained like that, his status becomes more intelligible, and its longevity more sympathetic. Hasselhoff was in the right place at the right time, for which some will always be appreciative, and they remember Looking for Freedom with the same degree of respect as the English do Three Lions. Perhaps both make recollections of what went before, and what came after, less painful.\n\nDavid Hasselhoff's role in the fall of the Berlin Wall | Emma Hartley Read more\n\nIn Let\u2019s Talk About Love: Why Other People Have Such Bad Taste \u2013 a critical consideration of the meaning of taste, as seen through the lens of C\u00e9line Dion\u2019s career \u2013 critic Carl Wilson wonders \u201cwhether \u2018easier\u2019 music might contain hints for reconciliation with the world into which we\u2019re already thrown. Maybe it deals with problems that don\u2019t require leaps of the imagination but require other efforts, like patience, or compromise.\u201d Hasselhoff\u2019s audience seem familiar with both qualities, while cynics see things in less tolerant, more binary terms, rejecting him on purely aesthetic grounds. Reconciling these two viewpoints seems as much of a stretch of the imagination \u2013 especially when faced by Do the Limbo Dance, which tonight inspires a conga line through the stalls \u2013 as the idea of the Wall falling once did. But harmony is exactly what, on a smaller scale, the Hoff achieves. The arena is packed with people from across the social divide, and however much Hasselhoff is mocked outside its walls, here there are dreadlocks and mohawks, groups in matching Baywatch T-shirts, late middle-aged couples who\u2019ve come straight from dinner, and others who weren\u2019t even born when the Wall fell. Several fans even wear replicas of the jacket Hasselhoff donned in December 1989.\n\nFor them, Hasselhoff is a reminder of an era when division seemed to have been overcome: a time when the world might come together. Indeed, if you listen to his selections, the wildly varied music is of less import than the lyrics. He convinces us that the preposterous Hot Shot City \u2013 \u201cYou will find her on the street / In her red Ferrari / With her top pulled down\u201d \u2013 is an anthem for Berlin, and employs Modern English to remind us to \u201cdream of better lives / The kind which never hates\u201d. Before Air Supply\u2019s Lonely Is the Night, he instructs us to introduce ourselves to the people next to us, \u201ceven if you know them\u201d, while the dramatic chorus of Open Your Eyes is spelled out on the screens behind him: \u201cSee the lies right in front of you.\u201d As for Sweet Caroline, its message is perfect for a man so desperate for us to be friends, not least with him: \u201cHands, touching hands / Reaching out, touching me, touching you\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Hasselhoff performing at Max-Schmeling-Halle, Berlin, 3 October 2019. Photograph: Frank Hoensch/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s a message he communicates successfully, and it\u2019s especially poignant in Berlin. Tonight, we\u2019re a ragbag of people singing a ragbag of songs, remembering \u2013 or, in surprisingly plentiful cases, imagining \u2013 how it felt to be so full of hope. Frankly, it\u2019s a relief. This is perhaps what the Hoff wants of us, too: to love and forgive each other as much as he loves and forgives us \u2013 which is as much as he wants us to love and forgive him. If we can manage that here, maybe we can take that tolerance away with us afterwards. It\u2019s gauche, but nonetheless admirable and \u2013 if you drop your prejudices \u2013 rather bewitching. Hasselhoff is a recovering alcoholic, and one suspects that to him, as to many, this city is a symbol of how a \u201cdifferent\u201d lifestyle can flourish after even awful things have happened. A bit more of this compassion, however self-satisfying, might resolve many conflicts, not just his own.\n\nWhether he\u2019s taken seriously or not, Hasselhoff is a unifying force. He\u2019s contradictory, of course: he demands walls stay up which he once wanted torn down; he sings karaoke with a grubby Sunset Strip rock band like he\u2019s changing the world. But even when the Wall tumbled \u2013 as Tim Mohr\u2019s recent, gripping history of the 1980s East German punk scene, Burning Down the Haus, reminds us \u2013 there were plenty of anti-capitalist DDR citizens who rejected reunification and wished instead to see socialism remodelled. Contradictions are a part of life. Resolving them should be too.\n\nHe brings things to a close, inevitably, with Looking for Freedom, and if you pay attention, you realise he understands that the thing about \u201clooking for freedom\u201d is that \u201cstill the search goes on\u201d. His relentless optimism is irresistible, and it\u2019s infectious, too. That he keeps persevering is to be applauded \u2013 as he is noisily tonight \u2013 and there is hope in how so many remain prepared to listen.", "description": "At his recent Berlin concert, the Hoff once again recalled his part in the fall of the Wall.
