He didn\u2019t plan to break the law, but he took pains to hide his identity behind a surgical mask all the same.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of cameras all around and you don\u2019t know who is standing beside you,\u201d said Mr. Chow, a film student in his early 20s.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s mostly young protesters say they fear their participation in the movement may follow them for life. They face arrest at protest marches deemed unauthorized by the city, or where clashes with police take place. Police have arrested around 1,450 protesters so far.\n\nMore ominously, they believe their identities may be collected digitally by mainland China and their participation used against them in the future. While there is scant evidence to prove this is happening, China\u2019s advances in facial recognition and other techniques have made it among the world\u2019s most aggressive surveillance states, they point out.\n\nTo ease these fears, even peaceful protesters take measures to hide themselves.\n\nFor example, they dress in black, making it difficult for authorities to single out any one person by their clothing, protesters say. They cover their faces with masks and neck scarves.\n\nMany carry umbrellas to shield against security cameras or unfamiliar people with cameras.\n\n\u201cActually, we can hide ourselves in a crowd,\u201d said Mr. Chow.\n\nThe stakes are higher for the so-called protest frontliners, who often confront police in tear-gas laden skirmishes. Police target them for arrest and have charged some with crimes such as rioting that can carry jail terms of up to 10 years.\n\nAlso dressed in black, those at the frontlines have their faces typically completely obscured behind gas masks, helmets and goggles. They use laser pointers to blind police.\n\nProtesters are careful with their communications. Most use the encrypted messaging app Telegram to exchange information about coming rallies.\n\nThey take pains to spray paint or tape over cameras along march routes, or in subway stations when coming or going from a protest. They are careful to pay in cash for their subway rides so their movements can\u2019t be tracked via their regular subway fare cards.\n\nThe day Mr. Chow marched, some protesters destroyed surveillance cameras along the route, ripping out the internal workings of one, and felling another altogether. As some worked to destroy the cameras, others gathered around blocking the view with umbrellas.\n\nDestroying the cameras reflects protesters\u2019 fear that Hong Kong\u2014a former British colony that was returned to China under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement in 1997\u2014is losing its semiautonomous status and becoming more tightly controlled, and surveilled, by Beijing.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want Hong Kong to become China,\u201d said Mr. Chow before joining the crowd, tears pooling in his eyes. He didn\u2019t participate in vandalizing the cameras.\n\nFor more than three months, hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents have protested weekly against the encroachment of mainland China. The protests started to oppose a proposed new law that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to China for trial. But they have since expanded to include other demands such as an inquiry into police violence and the right to elect the city\u2019s leader through direct voting. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam recently pledged to withdraw the extradition bill, but the demonstrations have continued.\n\nWrite to John Lyons at john.lyons@wsj.com", "description": "Protesters in Hong Kong fear they are being monitored by the local government and potentially by China, a country at the cutting edge of mass surveillance.
