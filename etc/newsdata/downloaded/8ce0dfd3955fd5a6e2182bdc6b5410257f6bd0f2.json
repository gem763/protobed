REUTERS/Mohamad Torokman\n\n\u201cWe tell Netanyahu, and whoever follows him, you will not break the Palestinians\u2019 will, you will never break our will, never, never,\u201d said Hassan Al-Abedi, a 55-year-old farmer who lives in the village of Jiftlik.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 land. We will hold onto it no matter what it costs.\u201d\n\nThe right-wing Netanyahu announced on Tuesday that he plans to \u201capply Israeli sovereignty\u201d to the Jordan Valley and adjacent northern Dead Sea if he prevails in what is shaping up as a tough battle for re-election on Sept. 17.\n\nThe plan drew condemnation from Arab leaders and from Palestinians, who seek to establish a state in all of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe office of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the plan \u201cwould constitute a serious violation of international law.\u201d\n\nPalestinian leaders said it would also effectively nullify interim peace deals from the 1990s that included security cooperation.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of Jordan\u2019s desert mountain range to the east, Palestinian farmers tended their crops and worried about their future in an area where the town of Jericho and the River Jordan are reminders of a biblical past.\n\n\u201cThis is not Netanyahu\u2019s land to give,\u201d said Ismael Hassan, a 75-year-old Palestinian from Zbeidat village. \u201cWhether or not Netanyahu succeeds (in the election) we won\u2019t accept it. This land is for Palestine, for the Palestinians.\u201d\n\nIn Israel, which captured the West Bank in a 1967 war, Netanyahu\u2019s declaration was widely seen as a bid to sap support from far-right election rivals who advocate annexation of Jewish settlements, and from a center-left that for decades has argued that the Jordan Valley should be kept on security grounds.\n\nRetaining the Jordan Valley would effectively leave Israel encircling any Palestinian political entity that emerges.\n\nCRAFTING OPINION\n\nFollowing up on his speech with remarks on Facebook on Wednesday, Netanyahu took credit for having persuaded U.S. President Donald Trump to recognize Israeli sovereignty over another strategic slice of occupied territory - the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967 - and to relocate the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.\n\nThe White House was informed in advance of Tuesday\u2019s annexation announcement, Netanyahu said, adding that he was \u201ccrafting opinion in favor of recognition of Israeli sovereignty in Judea and Samaria and the Jordan Valley\u201d.\n\nA U.S. official confirmed Washington had been notified but said the announcement was not coordinated.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s decision to make the promise showed that he had little reason to fear any pushback from the Trump administration, which has hewed to a heavily pro-Israel policy and backed Trump at almost every turn since he took office in 2017.\n\nBREADBASKET, BORDER\n\nSome 53,000 Palestinians and around 12,800 Israeli settlers live in the Jordan Valley, according to monitor Peace Now. The main Palestinian city in the region is Jericho, with around 28 villages and smaller Bedouin communities.\n\nPalestinians often refer to the Jordan Valley as their \u201cbreadbasket\u201d. In his speech on Tuesday, Netanyahu described it as Israel\u2019s eastern border with Jordan.\n\n\u201cEven Netanyahu\u2019s main rivals believe that any Palestinian entity that is established in the West Bank should be completely encircled by Israel, having no border with Jordan,\u201d said Nathan Thrall, an International Crisis Group analyst.\n\n\u201cThe annexation plan shouldn\u2019t be dismissed as election bluster. If reelected, Netanyahu will be under tremendous pressure to implement it.\u201d\n\nThe valley, which at 2,400 square kilometers (926 square miles) accounts for nearly 30% of the West Bank, has dozens of Palestinian farms as well as open areas that the Palestinian Authority has sought to develop for solar energy projects and industrial zones.\n\nThere are some 30 mainly agricultural settlements in the area, along with 18 smaller Israeli outposts, Peace Now says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to have a Palestinian state without the Jordan Valley,\u201d chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told Reuters in an interview from his office in Jericho.\n\n\u201cMy prosperity can come (only) if I can control my natural resources, my shores on the Dead Sea, my shores on the Mediterranean, my water, my land.\u201d\n\nErekat said the Palestinians would welcome \u201ca third party presence\u201d such as NATO or the European Union but said: \u201cA Israeli military or civilian presence in the state of Palestine is not okay. Because this will not make peace.\u201d\n\nIsraeli leaders have ruled out such a foreign peacekeeper force, citing the failure of a similar proposal for Gaza after Israel quit that territory in 2005.\n\n\u201cWe did not get an era of peace. We got three wars. We\u2019re not going to allow that to happen to our east,\u201d said Dore Gold, a Netanyahu confidant who runs the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs think-tank.\n\nPOLITICAL GAMBIT\n\nThe last round of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks broke down in 2014.\n\nThe Trump administration is expected to release its long-delayed peace plan after Israel\u2019s election, and it is still unclear whether the proposal will adhere to previous U.S. support for the creation of a Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel.\n\nThat rollout is unlikely to be affected even if Netanyahu goes ahead with the Jordan Valley annexation plan after the election, a U.S. official said.\n\nPalestinians have boycotted the Trump administration, accusing it of pro-Israel bias.\n\nA far-right coalition partner of Netanyahu hinted at doubt about the premier\u2019s sincerity, saying there had been no movement on the Jordan Valley question during his decade in power. \u201cHow come this matter (annexation) is coming up now, a week before the election?\u201d Bezalel Smotrich told Israel\u2019s Army Radio.\n\nNetanyahu also reaffirmed a pledge to annex all of the settlements Israel has established in the West Bank. But he said that broader step could take longer and required \u201cmaximum coordination\u201d with Washington.\n\nNetanyahu is fighting for his political life after an inconclusive election in April. His Likud party is running neck and neck in opinion polls with former armed forces chief Benny Gantz\u2019s Blue and White.", "description": "Palestinians tilling the fertile Jordan Valley said on Wednesday they have been rooted for generations to the West Bank land that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to annex, and they vowed never to give it up.", "authors": ["Adel Abu Nimeh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428921834&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A17N-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
