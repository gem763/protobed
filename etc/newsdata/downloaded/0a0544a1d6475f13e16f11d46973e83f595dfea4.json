And let me tell you, from having worked at NBC News for nearly a decade, everybody knew,\u201d Vester stressed. \u201cWe all knew Matt was dangerous. He had to be avoided at all costs. So for NBC executives to say they didn\u2019t know \u2014 I have a hard time with that.\u201d\n\nVester admitted that she herself did not personally observe misbehavior by Lauer, but cautioned, \u201cThere\u2019s a problem with abuse of power at NBC News where people like Matt Lauer, people like Tom Brokaw, are enabled day after day by having so much power over women and the careers of women. It distorts them, frankly.\n\n\u201cI saw it in Tom Brokaw myself \u2014 after enough power and enough enabling, they start to think that they can get away with anything, including coercing women into doing something they don\u2019t want to do.\u201d\n\nWhen asked her thoughts on Lauer\u2019s female colleagues who have stood up for him, Vester observed, \u201cI think it\u2019s entirely possible that women had neutral or positive professional relationships with Matt \u2014 or Tom. But I think it\u2019s important to know that predators hide their behavior. They hide a lot.\u201d\n\nVester offered sharp criticism for Comcast, NBC News\u2019 parent company, for their handling of the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to get the truth out when the company itself is having an internal investigation instead of outside independent investigators really being able to get to the bottom of things,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for us to get the answers so that women at NBC News can be safe.\u201d\n\nVester, 54, served as a war correspondent for NBC in the \u201890s, and alleged that legendary newscaster Brokaw groped her and attempted to kiss her against her will several times when she was 28. Brokaw denies the allegations.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nTell us what you think! Hit us up on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, or leave your comments below.
