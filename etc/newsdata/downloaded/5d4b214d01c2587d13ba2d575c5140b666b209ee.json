Russian Sergey Shubenkov, the champion in 2015 and runner-up two years ago, has been inconsistent, as has defending champion Omar McLeod of Jamaica.\n\nThe other final on Wednesday night\u2019s program is in men\u2019s hammer throw.\n\nIn a rarity, decathlon and heptathlon athletes are competing at the same time - part of the plan to condense all action into nighttime sessions. The stands in the 40,000-seat stadium were about one-eighth full when the action began Wednedsay evening in Doha.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There are three gold medals up for grabs Wednesday at track and field world championships, including one in women's 200-meter sprint that looks as wide open as ever.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/02/qatar_athletics_worlds_16736_c0-233-5568-3479_s1770x1032.jpg?a5a0d838ef6c4cc1ed50475c9b5d454f6fdede4f"}
