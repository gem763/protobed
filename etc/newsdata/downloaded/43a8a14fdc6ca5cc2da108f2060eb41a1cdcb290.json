Congress should pay attention.", "language": "en", "text": "As Congress returns to session this week, our elected officials need to take note of seismic progress on gun safety from an unlikely source: the private sector.\n\nOn Thursday, 145 business leaders representing some of America's most respected companies \u2014 including Airbnb, Cond\u00e9 Nast, Dick's Sporting Goods, Gap Inc., Levi Strauss & Co., Lyft, Royal Caribbean, Twitter, and Uber \u2014 released a letter urging the Senate to stand with the American public and pass a bill to require background checks on all gun sales and a strong Red Flag law that would allow federal courts to issue life-saving, extreme-risk protection orders.\n\nBut corporate America isn't waiting for Washington to act. Last week, Walmart announced it would limit ammunition sales, stop selling handguns, and ask customers to refrain from openly carrying firearms in its stores. This decision came a month after a gunman walked into a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and killed 22 people with an assault rifle.\n\nShortly after Walmart made its announcement, Kroger, Walgreens, CVS, Wegmans, Albertsons Companies, ALDI, Meijer, and Publix did the same. It's telling that so many of America's largest retailers have determined that our nation's laws aren't strong enough to protect their customers and employees.\n\nThis wave of corporate action stands in stark contrast to the Senate. It has now been six months since the House of Representatives sent the Senate a bipartisan bill to strengthen America's background check law. Over that time, thousands of Americans have been shot and killed and millions shaken by headline-grabbing mass shootings.\n\nBut in the face of so much senseless loss, the Senate has done nothing. This defies both common sense and public opinion. A recent poll conducted by Everytown for Gun Safety, the organization I work for, and Global Strategy Group found that 95% of voters support background checks \u2014 including 93% of Republican voters.\n\nThe reason why Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is so reluctant to take action is simple: the NRA. For decades, the gun lobby wielded enormous influence over our nation's laws and corporate policies. But those days are ending.\n\nThe organization's favorability ratings are now underwater, and recent revelations have revealed that NRA leaders have been using member donations as their own personal piggy bank. Things have gotten so bad for the NRA that Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick of Texas, a conservative Republican with an \"A\" grade from the organization, recently bucked the gun lobby and came out in favor of background checks.\n\nMore politicians should follow the example of business leaders, who have clearly figured out that the gun lobby's extremist agenda is out of step with the American people.\n\nThe NRA responded to Walmart's announcement with a statement blasting the company, hoping that would be enough to scare off \u2014 or at least slow down \u2014 other CEOs. Instead, the NRA's threats got lost in a blizzard of press coverage about other retailers following Walmart's lead.\n\nBut business can't solve America's gun crisis on its own. Exhibit A is the recent mass shooting in West Texas, which killed seven people and injured at least 22 more. The shooter, who had a history of criminal activity and mental illness, tried to buy a gun from a licensed seller but was blocked because he failed a background check. Unfortunately, this was just a minor inconvenience. Thanks to deadly loopholes in our current law, the shooter was able to easily \u2014 and legally \u2014 obtain an assault weapon from a private seller.\n\nThe power to close these loopholes for good now rests with President Donald Trump and McConnell. As they consider their options, they would be wise to remember what Sam Walton, who founded Walmart, liked to say about how to succeed: Give the people what they want.\n\nRight now, what the American people want is action on gun safety. Business leaders are responding, and our elected officials should follow suit.", "description": "145 business leaders called on Congress to do something about gun violence in the US.
