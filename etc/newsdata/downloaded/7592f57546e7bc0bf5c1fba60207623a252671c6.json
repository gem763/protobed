I went to Gigg Lane, their home ground, and spoke to supporters about the club\u2019s plight. One of them was Dave Horner.\n\nHorner was the type of vox pop you appreciate after being parachuted into a story you have not covered extensively before. Other fans I spoke to talked of sadness and anger about Bury\u2019s demise, but Horner touched on something I had not expected.\n\n\u201cThere is a certain sense of embarrassment that we haven\u2019t done enough,\u201d he said, believing he and his fellow supporters had acted too slowly, unfavourably comparing them with fans of other clubs who took early action against ruinous owners. \u201cThey can see the iceberg on the horizon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing it when it\u2019s on the bow.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

A week on, I still do not necessarily agree. But if a Bury supporter can accept some responsibility for the loss of the club, then the wider football community can too.\n\nI cover northern football for The Independent, which means covering the northwest of England and the three clubs who audiences are most interested in reading about: Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool. This skewed level of interest ensures our coverage informs our audience about the elite clubs they are interested in, while at the same time not neglecting important stories outside of those clubs.\n\nBut my story from Bury was the first thing I wrote about the club\u2019s plight, which dates back months and years. I was not ignorant of their problems but I did prioritise other clubs, believing Bury would ultimately survive. I was wrong.\n\nMy colleague Miguel Delaney wrote about the uncertainty which clubs outside of the Premier League face and pointed out that while any football fan would be appalled by the slow death of the English pyramid, we are simultaneously enthralled by \u201cthe grand show\u201d at the very top of the game.\n\nThat\u2019s the problem we face if we don\u2019t want to see more local clubs go to the wall. If Bury supporters can ask what they could have done, so can the whole of football, including those of us privileged enough to report on it.\n\nYours,\n\nMark Critchley\n\nNorthern football correspondent", "description": "Bury, one of the oldest clubs in English football, has been expelled from the\u00a0Football League and left on the brink of liquidation.
