The semi-autonomous territory has a separate legal system under a \"one-country, two-systems\" framework.\n\nHong Kong's Jockey Club also cancelled all races planned for Wednesday after pro-democracy protesters said they would target the Happy Valley racecourse where a horse part-owned by a pro-China lawmaker was due to run.\n\nHong Kong's Jockey Club also cancelled all races planned for Wednesday after pro-democracy protesters said they would target the Happy Valley racecourse.

There has been a horse-racing track there since just after British colonial rule began in the mid-1800s.\n\nRaces are held in the evening to avoid the sub-tropical heat of the day.\n\nWater cannons fired, bricks thrown during weekend protests\n\nPolice fired water cannon and volleys of tear gas on Sunday to disperse protesters, many of them masked and wearing black, who threw petrol bombs and set fires in Causeway Bay and the nearby Central district.\n\nIn a direct challenge to Beijing, some protesters threw bricks at police outside the Chinese People's Liberation Army base and set fire to a red banner proclaiming the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.\n\nDemonstrators are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city's affairs despite a promise of autonomy.\n\nThe spark for the latest protests in June was planned legislation, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial. But they have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.\n\nHong Kong returned to China in 1997 under the one-country, two-systems formula, which ensures freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nSunday's violence followed a peaceful rally outside the British Consulate where protesters said one country, two systems was dead, and urged Britain to call on China to stand by its promises.\n\nChina says it is committed to the arrangement, denies meddling and says the city is an internal Chinese issue. It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest and told them to mind their own business.\n\nHong Kong democracy activists urged members of the U.S. Congress on Tuesday to pass legislation to combat human rights abuses in the city, rejecting any suggestion that such a move would be inappropriate U.S. involvement in another country's affairs.", "description": "Hong Kong has called off the annual fireworks display on Oct. 1 to mark China's National Day as pro-democracy protests show no sign of ending.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5287880.1568801860!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/china-anniversary-hongkong.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
