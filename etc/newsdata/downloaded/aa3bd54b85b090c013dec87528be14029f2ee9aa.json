Beagles reportedly had pipes forced down their throats and were given capsules, and were left suffering and often bleeding following the experiments.\n\nBritish family jailed after swerving to avoid animal and ending up on US road\n\nFriedrich M\u00fclln from Soko Tierschutz said: \u2018The animals were even still waggling their tails when they were being taken to be killed, the dogs were desperate for human contact.\n\n\u2018The worst treatment was kept for the monkeys. The macaques bread of monkeys are small, relatively light primates, which are often used for animal experiments at LPT.\n\n\u2018They are kept in cramped conditions in small cages. Many of the animals have developed compulsive tendencies and are seen going round in circles.\u2019\n\nPhotos show the monkeys strapped to seats in rows on the wall, others have their heads in restraints and are shown desperately trying to escape. According to the undercover activist, the animals are treated with violence by the workers, who are not trained animal carers.\n\nA beagle has a pipe shoved down its throat and capsules forced down (Picture: Cruelty Free International/CEN)\n\nMany of them had their heads in restraints with others desperately trying to escape (Picture: Cruelty Free International/CEN)\n\nThe cats are reportedly often given up to 13 injections per day by untrained professionals and left to suffer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe animal activists have reported the case to police who are investigating.. They also claim the laws in Germany protecting animals from experiments are not strict enough and call for the laws to be tightened.\n\nLPT is a family-owned contract-testing laboratory carrying out toxicity testing for pharmaceutical, industrial and agro-chemical companies from all over the world in order to meet the requirements of governments and regulatory authorities.\n\nAccording to the organisation Cruelty Free International: \u2018Toxicity testing involves poisoning animals to see how much of a chemical or drug it takes to cause serious harm, in an attempt to measure what a \u2018safe\u2019 dose for humans might be.\n\nAn undercover activist managed to get a job at the lab and filmed the animals (Picture: Cruelty Free International/CEN)\n\n\u2018Animals are injected with or made to eat or inhale increasing amounts of a substance to measure the toxic effects which can be severe and include vomiting, internal bleeding, respiratory distress, fever, weight loss, lethargy, skin problems, organ failure and even death. No anaesthetics or pain relief are provided.\u2019\n\nMichelle Thew, Chief Executive of Cruelty Free International stated: \u2018Our investigation has uncovered appalling animal suffering, inadequate care, poor practices and breaches of European and German law.\n\n\u2018We are calling for the Laboratory of Pharmacology and Toxicology (LPT) to be closed. We are also calling for a comprehensive review into the use of animals in regulatory toxicity testing in Europe, including the UK. Every investigation, without fail, shows a similar tale of misery and disregard of the law.\u2019\n\nThe lab has not yet commented on the footage.", "description": "Strapped in with metal harnesses and kept in tiny containers, this horrific footage and pictures shows the treatment of monkeys and dogs, allegedly held in a German laboratory.
