In the past few years, action cameras have developed from niche curiosities into really popular devices that can capture amazing footage. But every year it's still the same story: market-leader GoPro releases a new camera, and other companies desperately try to catch up. Some companies have come close to making one as good as its best, but as soon as they do, GoPro releases a new one.\n\nThis time around, however, GoPro\u2019s releases were aimed at the low end. That means all of its competitors had a year to catch up to the company\u2019s two standard bearers: the Hero 4 Black and the Hero 4 Silver.\n\nThe most important thing an action camera should do is shoot beautiful, high-quality footage, with different options for resolutions and framerates. It should also have a great system of accessories and mounts so you can put the camera anywhere and use it to record anything you're doing, which means it also has to be small and light enough that it\u2019s not a burden to wear. Action cameras should also be easy to use, with good on-camera controls and a great companion app for your smartphone.\n\nThe race to make the best action camera is tighter than ever before, but only one of them does all of these things better than the others \u2014 and it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise.\n\nThe Winner\n\nOur review of GoPro Hero 4 Black Verge Score 9 out of 10 Buy for $499.99 from GoPro\n\nThe best action camera you can buy is the GoPro Hero 4 Black. It shoots excellent footage in sunlight, cloudy weather, indoors, and even at night. It may be pricey, but it still gives you the best image quality you can get from any action camera, hands down.\n\nThe Hero 4 Black has a super wide field of view, shoots 4K footage, and offers a few different super slow motion modes as well. But the footage also looks great even if you\u2019re shooting at 1080p, which is really the right resolution for most people. And while you probably wouldn\u2019t want to use it as your only still camera, it takes gorgeous 12-megapixel photos.\n\nIt\u2019s also tiny. Even with a waterproof housing on it, the Hero 4 Black is hard to notice, whether you have it strapped to your arm or stuck to your helmet. It\u2019s solidly built and can take a few dings and drops if you don\u2019t have a case on it. The battery is easy to swap, which is good, because short battery life is still one of the biggest problems you\u2019ll face when using a GoPro.\n\nGoPro menus used to be a chore to navigate, but the company has really streamlined them with the Hero 4 lineup. Each menu is easy to read on the tiny, front-facing LCD screen, and they\u2019re much easier to understand. If you don\u2019t want to use the on-camera buttons, or if you have to set your camera up at a distance, you can always use GoPro\u2019s great mobile app. It offers a live view with very little lag so it\u2019s easy to frame up your shot, you can start and stop recording from it and change settings on the fly, and it gives you the ability to trim, save, and share clips. And if you\u2019re new to video editing, the GoPro desktop app has really come a long way as well. Proprietary desktop software is usually pretty awful, but GoPro has finally made something worth installing if you want to edit video without learning advanced editing software like Final Cut Pro.\n\nBut one of the best things about GoPro is the assortment of mounts and accessories that are available for it. The company makes one for just about any application you can imagine. They sell roll bar mounts, helmet mounts, chest straps, selfie sticks, dog mounts, underwater housings, and so much more. Even better, GoPro has been the industry standard for so long that third-party companies also make dozens of mounts for these cameras, as well as some really crazy accessories.\n\nThe Hero 4 Black is still the best you can get, but if you have a smaller budget or really specific needs, this is the best time ever to really weigh your options.\n\nThe Runner-Up\n\nRight behind the Hero 4 Black is the Hero 4 Silver. The Hero 4 Silver is nearly the same camera as its more expensive counterpart, and it\u2019s just as great. You still get really awesome image quality in almost any setting, even though you lose the ability to shoot 4K video and super slow motion. What you gain is a built-in LCD touchscreen, which makes it extremely easy to line up your shot or review your footage (at the expense of battery life, of course). The Silver is typically about $100 cheaper than the Hero 4 Black, too, but it works with all the same mounts and accessories, so you\u2019re not really worse off for buying it. It may not be quite as capable as the Hero 4 Black, but if you\u2019re new to action cameras, this is probably your best bet.\n\nThe Others\n\nOur review of Sony 4K Action Cam Verge Score 8 out of 10 Sony\u2019s 4K Action Cam is, no doubt, the best competition to the top-of-the-line GoPros. It offers nearly equal image quality, and in some situations the battery life is better than GoPro\u2019s. Sony has also done a good job building out a great system of mounts and accessories. The problem is that the 4K Action Cam is a total chore to use. The on-camera menu system is awful, and it can take a dozen taps to accomplish a task. Sony did make its mobile app suck a little less, and you can even edit footage you\u2019ve shot \u2014 but only in second, separate app. If you need to shoot ultra high-resolution or slow motion video and you don\u2019t need something as small as a GoPro, this is the action camera for you.

It\u2019s smaller and lighter than previous models, and the image quality is much better. It\u2019s not as good as GoPro\u2019s or Sony\u2019s, but it\u2019s better than just about everything else on the market. Garmin has also done something really smart \u2014 it made an adapter so that the VIRB XE can work with GoPro mounts, so you have just as much flexibility as you would if you bought a Hero 4. The VIRB XE can also overlay a bunch of cool data on your footage, like speed, G-Force, altitude, and more. Buy for $399.99 from Garmin\n\nOur review of GoPro Hero4 Session Verge Score 7.8 out of 10 One of the lower-end cameras that GoPro released this year was the Hero 4 Session. It\u2019s the company\u2019s first major redesign in its action camera lineup, and it\u2019s GoPro\u2019s most fun and easy-to-use camera to date. The tiny 1.5-inch cube is waterproof out of the box and has just one main button. (There\u2019s a smaller button on the back to activate the Wi-Fi.) It won\u2019t shoot 4K footage, and there\u2019s no screen, but the battery can last you for hours, and it\u2019s by far the easiest action camera to use. Buy for $399.99 from GoPro\n\nOur review of TomTom Bandit Action Camera Verge Score 7.3 out of 10 TomTom released the Bandit this year, and there\u2019s a lot to like about the company\u2019s first action camera. You don\u2019t need to use wires because the back of the camera pulls out to reveal a hidden USB connector, so you can easily charge it or dump footage. Like Garmin, TomTom also has a GoPro mount adapter, so you have a ton of options. The Bandit automatically tags cool moments in your footage \u2014 like when there are changes in direction, velocity, or if things move through the frame \u2014 and the app can assemble a montage of these clips. (You can manually tag, too.) The Bandit\u2019s image quality is definitely a step below GoPro\u2019s, Sony\u2019s, and Garmin\u2019s, but it\u2019s good enough for most people. The camera collects some basic data like GPS and speed and can overlay that on your footage, though it\u2019s not quite as detailed as Garmin\u2019s. Buy for $399.99 from TomTom\n\nOur review of iON Air Pro 3 Verge Score 7.3 out of 10 The ION Air Pro 3 is a tough, cylindrical camera that produces rich images which need less tuning in an editing software, but its price is a bit steep for what little you get in return. ION makes a decent amount of accessories, and it does have a good phone app \u2014 which is a good thing because there's little you can do to change them on the camera itself. Buy for $349.99 from iON\n\nOur review of Garmin Virb Elite Verge Score 6.8 out of 10 If you're an adventurer looking to quantify every activity you record, Garmin\u2019s Virb Elite holds its own. It comes with great battery life and offers the ability to overlay on your video your GPS, altimeter and other data from companion Garmin devices like a heart rate monitor. Compared to others, the Virb\u2019s video quality isn\u2019t a standout, and often captures colors that just look wrong. It's a niche device in a market for the masses. Buy for $269.99 from Garmin\n\nOur review of Drift Ghost-S Verge Score 6.3 out of 10 The Drift Ghost S would be a decent action camera if we were still living in 2014. It\u2019s one of the best of a number of other action cameras that make up the mid to low end of the market, but it really can\u2019t compete with companies like Sony and GoPro.
