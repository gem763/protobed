(AP) - Three times in just over a year, the Los Angeles Rams have agreed to pay the most guaranteed money ever given to a running back, a defensive lineman and a quarterback.\n\nThe records set by Todd Gurley and Aaron Donald didn\u2019t stand for long. Jared Goff\u2019s new deal guarantees him a whopping $110 million, the most in NFL history for any player - and even that record certainly won\u2019t last much longer.\n\nBut a franchise that went through 13 consecutive non-winning seasons and a 12-year playoff drought has richly rewarded the franchise cornerstones who lifted them to a Super Bowl berth last year and are trying to force their way back through their wide-open championship window.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re always taking care of guys,\u201d said receiver Robert Woods, who got a significant pay bump himself in the offseason. \u201cThey\u2019re keeping their team intact, keeping the family intact. You\u2019re allowed to grow as a team and really bond and play for each other when you\u2019re keeping the core guys around.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s the logic behind these lavish moves, according to the players benefiting from them and the bosses agreeing to them.\n\nThe Rams want a harmonious, motivated group of key players as they chase a title in their collective primes. While others speculate on whether the 24-year-old Goff is a true franchise quarterback, or whether Gurley will end up looking overpaid a half-decade from now, the Rams say they\u2019re focused on making sure the pillars of their recent success are in optimal conditions for winning.\n\n\u201cWhen you see that, you\u2019re looking at someone that really cares and takes care of their guys,\u201d receiver Brandin Cooks said. \u201cThey\u2019re keeping that camaraderie and that family atmosphere. You come here and do your job and fit right in, and sooner or later, you\u2019re going to get taken care of.\u201d\n\nCooks got a five-year, $81 million deal from the Rams last year before he had even played a down for his new team. Cooks, Goff, Gurley and Donald are all tied to the Rams through at least the 2023 season, cementing the foundation of a team that has won 24 regular-season games and two NFC West titles since coach Sean McVay took over two seasons ago.\n\nMcVay praised Rams owner Stan Kroenke\u2019s willingness to write one big check after another - including an improved deal for McVay a few months ago.\n\n\u201cIt makes you want to work that much harder for him and for this organization when you can do the things that we believe in,\u201d McVay said. \u201cThat helps us take steps in the right direction, when we make commitments to the people we want to do this with for a while.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 largesse has prompted criticism and encouraged widespread speculation on future salary cap troubles with all of those massive contracts on the books. The Rams\u2018 front office isn\u2019t about to lay out its multiyear budget plan for those contingencies, but the executives are confident in their ability to manage the books into the future.\n\n\u201cThis was something that not only took into consideration taking care of Jared the way that we felt like he deserved to be taken care of,\u201d McVay said. \u201cBut also what\u2019s in our best interest, and how that might potentially affect our ability to re-sign other guys, as crazy as that sounds. Every decision we make is always in the best interest of the team.\u201d\n\nThe Rams could have stretched out the process of signing Goff for another year, perhaps waiting to see how he performed this season. But McVay firmly believes Goff has shown him more than enough over the previous two seasons to justify a deal of this magnitude and length.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that demonstrates a commitment that we\u2019ve always felt to him,\u201d McVay said. \u201cTo know that he\u2019s going to be able to take care of his family for a long time and maybe take me to dinner is a good thing.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another reason for getting done early: Goff\u2019s huge new contract is structured to help the Rams mitigate its impact, team president Kevin Demoff said. For instance, Goff will make more money in the upcoming season than he would have under his rookie contract.\n\n\u201cThat is part of the reason why getting it done earlier is beneficial,\u201d Goff said. \u201cI\u2019m not the type of guy that ever wants to do that to a team, and I think that\u2019s definitely calculated by them. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that will hinder us tremendously.\u201d\n\nGoff confessed his relief at being finished with months of negotiations. He admits the talks were spurred forward by Philadelphia\u2019s deal in June with Carson Wentz, the No. 2 pick behind Goff in 2016.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something you think about your whole life,\u201d Goff said. \u201cLike getting drafted and getting to the Super Bowl, this is one of those moments, for sure. Obviously, the numbers you never dream about, but getting a contract that establishes you as somebody that is a franchise quarterback in this league and is going to play for a long time is something you dream about.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Three times in just over a year, the Los Angeles Rams have agreed to pay the most guaranteed money ever given to a running back, a defensive lineman and a quarterback.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/rams_cementing_cornerstone_football_45679_c0-79-3054-1859_s1770x1032.jpg?96acca72c0dbee082f3cc7e7fedc49e55783eb78"}
