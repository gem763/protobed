Houston experienced record-breaking rainfall for the month of September, seeing more than nine inches, ABC reported. Crews rescued people from their homes and Imelda has prompted the evacuation of at least 1,000 residents, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe current flooding is a reminder of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which brought \u201cunprecedented\u201d rainfall.

We let them in and take care of them, just let them know that people care about them.\u201d\n\nMcIngvale told KTRK that the store, at 6006 North Freeway, opened its doors to the public around 11:30 a.m.\n\n\u201cOne of the best things about Houston is we come through these dark hours very well.
