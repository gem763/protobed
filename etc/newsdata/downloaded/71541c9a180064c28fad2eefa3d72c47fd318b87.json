The German 10-year Bund yield fell as low as -0.75%.\n\nData from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday suggested that portfolio bets on gold remain at historically high levels, despite edging down slightly last week. Bloomberg said its data showed ETF holdings of gold rose by over 101 tons in August, after two months in which holdings had by a combined 154 tons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s continuing to look like a bit of a crowded trade though which is showing in the momentum indicators, suggesting some near-term doubt may be creeping in,\u201d said MarketBeat\u2019s Craig Erlam. \u201cBulls aren\u2019t letting go easily, though, and continue to buy the dips on the belief that the fundamentals will ultimately deliver more gains.\u201d\n\nHowever, there are signs that the rally\u2019s strongest fundamental factor may be losing force: analysis by the World Gold Council suggests that net purchases by central banks fell by nearly 90% in July from June to only 13.1 tons - the lowest level of monthly net purchases since August 2017, according to the WGC\u2019s Krishan Gopal.\n\nThe countries overwhelmingly responsible for net central bank purchases were overwhelmingly China, Russia, Turkey and Kazakhstan. In the two biggest of those, China and Russia, the accumulation of foreign reserves has weakened in recent weeks, with the Chinese central bank notably embarking on a managed depreciation of the yuan.\n\nThe WGC\u2019s data also show that Indian jewellery demand has also weakened in response to surging prices and the sharpest slowdown in Indian economic growth in seven years.\n\nElsewhere, silver continued to play catch-up with its more glamorous sister metal, rising 1.8% to an intraday high of $18.67 an ounce, only 9c short of the three-year high it hit last week.\n\nCopper futures meanwhile slumped below $2.50 a pound for the first time since late 2016.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nOil Falls 2% as Trade War and Rising Output Weigh\n\nU.S. LNG grabs 10% market share as January-August exports equal 2018 volumes\n\nRosneft says Transneft failed to offer solution to crisis over tainted oil", "description": "Investing.com -- Gold prices edged higher on Tuesday as a combination of nerves over Brexit, Hong Kong and U.S.-China relations all kept haven assets well bid and risk assets on the defensive.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg"}
