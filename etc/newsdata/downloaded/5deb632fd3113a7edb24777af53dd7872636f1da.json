Here's what you do: stir together some canned tuna, garlic, lemon juice, red onion, black olives, capers and fresh parsley, then spread it on buttered toast. Top it off with a round of ripe tomato or slivers of avocado and another slice of toast. That's it. If you want to make it into a dip, toss the mixture into a food processor with a few tablespoons of softened butter and a bit more olive oil. Pur\u00e9e until smooth and creamy and serve with carrots, fennel, bell pepper and seeded crackers. If you have a tin of sardines taunting you from inside your cabinet, we bet this recipe would work equally well with those.\n\nFeatured in: A Dip To Sustain The Cook Till Thanksgiving Dinner.", "description": "This is not your mother's mayonnaise-laden tuna salad, but it's just as easy to prepare Here's what you do: stir together some canned tuna, garlic, lemon juice, red onion, black olives, capers and fresh parsley, then spread it on buttered toast Top it off with a round of ripe tomato or slivers of avocado and another slice of toast", "authors": ["Melissa Clark", "Pete Wells", "Mark Bittman", "Marian Burros", "Pierre Franey", "Nancy Harmon Jenkins", "Julia Moskin", "Samin Nosrat", "David Tanis", "Ali Slagle"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/dining/tuna-dip/tuna-dip-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2017-05-23"}
