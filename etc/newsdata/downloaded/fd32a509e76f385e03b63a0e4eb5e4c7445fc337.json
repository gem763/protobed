The couple finalized their divorce in 2013.\n\nIS DEMI MOORE AGING BACKWARDS?\n\nHowever, like other obstacles she's faced, Moore, now 56, stared it all down privately and with a steely reserve.\n\n\u201cI have zero interest in being a victim,\u201d she told the magazine.\n\nMoore explained of her mentality in general that she believes everything happens for a reason, even tragedies like losing a child, or trials like her amicable divorce from ex-husband Bruce Willis and the beatings she's taken in the press.\n\n\u201cEverything that occurs in our individual lives informs us. Shifting, molding, presenting the opportunities for the exact purpose to get us where we are in the present time. Whatever that may be,\u201d she said.\u201cAll the projecting of who they think I am [were] the very things that were pushing me out of two elements: my comfort zone, and my control. [They were] trying to get me to let go and really be who I am. And I don\u2019t think that I knew how to do that.\u201d\n\nDEMI MOORE OPENS UP ABOUT \u2018SPIRALING DOWN A PATH OF REAL SELF-DESTRUCTION\u2019\n\nNot knowing who she really was \u2014 or simply not being able to embrace it yet \u2014 was a factor in her falling off the wagon in her battle for sobriety during her 40s. She's since recovered and gained insight into what may have led to her briefly succumbing to her demons. It's also part of what inspired her upcoming memoir, \"Inside Out.\"\n\nMoore went to rehab in the mid-1980s for drug and alcohol addiction and was hospitalized in January 2012 after collapsing in her Los Angeles home, People reported. She later sought treatment for exhaustion and to \u201cimprove her overall health.\u201d\n\nMILA KUNIS SAYS ASHTON KUTCHER'S MARRIAGE TO DEMI MOORE WAS 'NORMAL'\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, what I realized is that when I opened the door [again], it was just giving my power away,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI guess I would think of it like this: It was really important to me to have natural childbirth because I didn\u2019t want to miss a moment. And with that I experienced pain. So part of being sober is, I don\u2019t want to miss a moment of life, of that texture, even if that means being in\u2014some pain.\u201d\n\nShe cleaned up her act not just for her own sake, but for those of her daughters, Rumer, 31, Tallulah, 25, and Scout, 28.\n\n\u201cAs a woman, a mother, and a wife, there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life ... My daughters offered me an opportunity to start to change the generational pattern. To be able to break the cycles.\u201d\n\nASHTON KUTCHER, DEMI MOORE SETTLE DIVORCE\n\nNow, Moore, ever maternal \u2014 she felt her interviewer Lena Dunham's head for a fever, and even brought her gifts \u2014 feels better than she did in 1991 when she posed nude for the first time on the cover of Vanity Fair. That 1991 story was less than flattering, often deferring to her then-marriage to \"Die Hard\" star Willis.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThank goodness people remember the photo,\" Moore said of the classic Annie Leibovitz image. \"They don\u2019t remember the article.\u201d", "description": "Demi Moore stripped down in more ways than one for the October 2019 issue of Harper's Bazaar.", "authors": ["Jessica Sager"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/demi-moore-nude-harpers-bazaar.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
