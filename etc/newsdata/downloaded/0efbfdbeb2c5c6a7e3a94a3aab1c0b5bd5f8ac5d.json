They joined a growing contingent who are bullish on select U.S. pot companies known as multistate operators, or MSOs.\n\n\u201cWith the U.S. operators penalized from a tax perspective, handcuffed in terms of true scientific research and restricted in terms of geographic optionality outside of the U.S., the operating paradigm is quite nuanced, relative to Canadian cannabis,\u201d they wrote.\n\nStill, they believe these companies have an easier time developing their brands due to regulatory nuances that let them operate in a way not much different from traditional packaged-goods companies. It is a business model \u201cthat relies more on high-margin finished goods, as opposed to specialty retail,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\nThe team initiated coverage on five growers\u2014three at Buy, one to Hold, and one to Sell. Here\u2019s what they had to say about each.\n\nGreen Thumb Industries (ticker: GTBIF) won an Outperform rating with a price target of $18.50. \u201cGTI is our highest conviction Outperform among all the U.S. MSOs now under our coverage,\u201d the analysts wrote.\n\n\u201cWhile several of GTI\u2019s peers have been keenly focused on rapidly expanding their retail footprints to build dominant retail brands, GTI has taken a slower, but we think more thoughtful approach, by balancing revenue mix between wholesale and retail,\u201d they said.\n\nThe analysts also cited the company\u2019s brand portfolio, presence in high-growth markets, and strong management team.\n\nThe company reported adjusted operated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of $4.7 million in the first half of 2019. The profit amounts to 6.4% of sales. \u201cWhile many peers discuss the margin benefits associated with the effects of scaling operations, GTI is one of the few MSOs on track to post near-term results that support such assertions,\u201d the report said.\n\nCresco Labs (CRLBF) also achieved an Outperform rating, with a $14 price target.\n\nCresco has made branded products and wholesale distribution its priorities, they noted. Rather than expanding to as many states as possible, Cresco has been more focused on building depth in the states where it does operate.\n\n\u201c[Cresco] is more focused on establishing a robust wholesale business by curating a portfolio of brands that can fully penetrate a market,\u201d they wrote.\n\nCuraleaf Holdings (CURLF), with a price target of $10.50, was the third company rated at Outperform.\n\n\u201cCuraleaf has positioned itself as one of the largest MSOs in the market, leading our coverage universe in terms of organic revenue generation, as well as pro forma revenues,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe company has about $2 billion in pending acquisitions, so mergers and acquisitions could be a catalyst for future gains, the analysts said. They noted, though, that the transactions are subject to antitrust review.\n\nThe company\u2019s revenue base\u2014and ability to generate Ebitda in the latest quarter\u2014make it appealing in terms of scale and profitability, the report said.\n\nMedMen (MMNFF), on the other hand, received an Underperform rating, with a $1.50 price target.\n\nThe company has focused on retail sales. \u201cWhile in isolation, this is a durable business model, in the nascent cannabis industry, we favor higher margin mix from wholesale,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nThe report said that while MedMen is the leader in the California market, reflecting what the analysts called an \u201cattractive retail concept,\u201d the company\u2019s reliance on retail sales, its spending levels, and management turnover are concerns.\n\nAcreage Holdings (ACRGF) came in at Market Perform, with a $9 price target.\n\nAcreage has a presence in 19 states, not counting a pending acquisition in Nevada, giving it the broadest position in the U.S. pot market. Still, the Cowen team said there is little in the works that could send the stock higher.\n\nThe company has a deal to be acquired by Canadian firm Canopy Growth (CGC), but that would only be triggered if the U.S. legalizes marijuana.\n\n\u201cWe value ACRG on a stand-alone basis without line of sight to completion of the [Canopy Growth] WEED deal,\u201d they wrote. \u201cGiven its low margin profile and dependency on M&A, we do not see much multiple upside beyond peer averages, which caps valuation upside.\u201d\n\nWrite to Connor Smith at connor.smith@barrons.com", "description": "Wall Street is warming up to a few pot growers that\u2014because marijuana is banned under federal law\u2014can\u2019t even list on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.", "authors": ["Connor Smith"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-106922/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
