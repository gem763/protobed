REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nWith a deal struck in Brussels, the focus turns back to whether lawmakers in London will approve it. For the supporters and staff of Derry City FC, hundreds of miles away from the corridors of power, the outcome is crucial.\n\nDerry City are in a tricky situation. While based in Northern Ireland, the \u201cTroubles\u201d in the 1970s led to them switching to play in the Republic\u2019s football league, their players and fans crossing the border every other week.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know how this is going to end up. As a club we are concerned,\u201d club director and former player Tony O\u2019Doherty told Reuters, at his community centre office on the Creggan estate, a strongly pro-Ireland nationalist area.\n\n\u201cUntil we see the deal, we are just not sure\u201d.\n\nThe club\u2019s worries echo those of thousands of borderland residents and businesses, whose lives straddle the now-invisible frontier, about how day to day life will carry on when one country is inside the EU and one will be outside.\n\nThe conundrum for politicians was how to prevent the frontier becoming a backdoor into the EU\u2019s single market without erecting checkpoints that could undermine the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that ended decades of conflict in the province.\n\nThe location of the club\u2019s Brandywell stadium explains much of its history. The ground is nestled in the Bogside district, just a few minutes walk from the emblematic Irish Republican mural that declares \u201cYou are now entering Free Derry\u201d.\n\nThe Bogside was the scene of the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d shootings in 1972 when soldiers from the British Parachute Regiment opened fire during an unauthorised civil rights march in one of the most notorious incidents of the conflict. Thirteen people were killed and 14 wounded, one of whom died later.\n\nEven before then, clubs from the Northern Irish league had refused to play at the Brandywell after an incident when the Ballymena team bus had been burned.\n\nThat in itself was a relatively minor incident at a time when the barricades were in place in the nationalist area of the city, where people supported a united Ireland, and clashes with the police and the British army were a regular occurrence.\n\nForced to play 30 miles away for a season, but still in Northern Ireland, the club\u2019s participation in the league was deemed no longer viable and they reluctantly resigned from the (Northern) Irish League in October, 1972.\n\n\u201cALMOST MYTHICAL\u201d\n\nFor 13 years, Derry City were in the wilderness, playing in an amateur Saturday morning league, with little but the memories of their 1965 championship winning season to ease the bitterness and a few references to the club on the record sleeves of local punk band The Undertones, to keep them in the public\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cGrowing up at that time with no club to watch, Derry City was something almost mythical,\u201d says former striker Liam Coyle, whose father Fay captained the title-winning team and who started his footballing life kicking a ball on the streets adjacent to the Brandywell.\n\nBut the determination of a group of four former players, including O\u2019Doherty, who worked to get the club into the Republic\u2019s League of Ireland in 1985, ensured that the club re-emerged and that Liam Coyle would have a chance to emulate his father\u2019s achievements.\n\nHaving persuaded the football authorities on both sides of the border to accept the highly unusual switch of leagues, Derry made a huge impact south of the border.\n\nAfter two seasons of bringing huge travelling support to tiny clubs in the second tier, \u201cThe Candystripes\u201d won promotion and then in 1989 won an unprecedented league and cups treble \u2013 with Coyle central to their success.\n\nThe club and its supporters have been crossing the border for games ever since and the peace process has even meant that another club, Institute FC, from the majority pro-British unionist Drumahoe district of the city, have ground-shared at the Brandywell after their own ground was ruined by floods.\n\nBut Brexit has disturbed the sense of ease at the club.\n\nThe team\u2019s manager Declan Devine is sure that, whatever the outcome, the club will find a way to continue through it.\n\n\u201cNobody knows what it entails for us. But this is nothing new for us. When the Troubles were at their worst ... we had buses stoned and windows put through when we were coming home,\u201d he said.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nO\u2019Doherty, whose status in his community is such that there is a mural of him on the Creggan estate, says the club can do nothing but wait for the politics to play out.\n\n\u201cThis whole Brexit thing has meant that the word \u2018never\u2019, whether in politics, business or sport, can\u2019t be used anymore.\n\n\u201cIt might have nothing to do with (us) at all but it is such a mess that no one knows.\u201d", "description": "As politicians from Britain and the European Union wrangled over the fate of the Irish border and post-Brexit customs arrangements, the fans of a League of Ireland football club are unlikely to have been uppermost in their thoughts.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441874833&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G175", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
