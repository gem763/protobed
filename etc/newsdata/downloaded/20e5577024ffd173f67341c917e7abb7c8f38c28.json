(Handout/Reuters)\n\nFinancier and convicted sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 whose death was ruled a suicide by the New York City medical examiner\u2019s office \u2014 was likely murdered, famed forensic pathologist and Fox News contributor Dr. Michael Baden said on Fox & Friends this morning after examining Epstein\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case,\u201d he said of the particular fractures found on Epstein\u2019s neck.\n\nEpstein was found hanging in his Manhattan prison cell on August 10 and was later declared dead. After rampant speculation, New York\u2019s chief medical examiner Barbara Sampson cautioned against taking details out of context.\n\n\u201cIn all forensic investigations, all information must be synthesized to determine the cause and manner of death. Everything must be consistent; no single finding can be evaluated in a vacuum,\u201d Sampson said on August 15.\n\nBut Baden\u2019s opinion on autopsy \u2014 especially of the combination of fractures in Epstein\u2019s neck \u2014 raised a number of key questions about Epstein\u2019s cause of death. \u201cThose three fractures are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation,\u201d Baden said.\n\nBaden, who has worked on multiple high-profile cases and has examined over 20,000 bodies over a five-decade career, was hired by Epstein\u2019s brother to attend the official autopsy. Baden revealed that at the time of the autopsy, the doctor overseeing the procedure \u201cdidn\u2019t think there was enough information to say suicide,\u201d and initially put the status of the case to \u201cpending further study,\u201d before changing it and publicly releasing the suicide ruling.\n\nBaden also said that any potential DNA under Epstein\u2019s fingernails, as well as on the sheets used to strangle him, has not yet been released.\n\n\u201cIt appears that this could have been a mistake,\u201d Baden said. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence here of homicide that should be investigated, to see if it is or isn\u2019t homicide.\u201d", "description": "Epstein, whose death was ruled a suicide by the NYC Medical Examiner's office, was likely murdered, says famed forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
