In the past week, a study conducted by Oxfam has revealed that two tonnes of clothing is purchased every minute in the UK. The emissions from the new clothes bought by people in the UK over the course of a month were found to be greater than those from flying a plane around the world 900 times. The study also found that 53 per cent of British adults were not aware of the damaging effects of fast fashion. The latter is almost unbelievable.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Net-a-porter 3/7 Patagonia Nano Puff\u00ae Hoody With a mission statement dedicated to causing no unneccesary harm to the Earth and implementing solutions to the environmental crisis, it was to be expected that an item from Patagonia would feature on the list.

Net-a-porter 5/7 Reformation\u2019s Gavin Dress Reformation clothing was dubbed the second most wanted Instagram brand in 2018 according to Lyst\u2019s Year in Fashion report.

Since then, the label\u2019s Gavin dress has become the most page viewed item for the brand on Lyst from September to December. \u201cWhen it comes to style, being more sustainable is all about taking a step back,\u201d explains Le Caer. \u201cAnd when the well-being of the planet is in the balance, it's something that's worth doing, no matter how busy our schedules might be.\u201d TheReformation 6/7 Allbird Tree Runners One of the most in-demand pair of environmentally-friendly trainers over the last year has been the AllBirds Tree Runners.

Weekday\n\nI didn\u2019t buy a single new piece of clothing in August \u2013 it wasn\u2019t difficult (and that\u2019s coming from a fashion obsessive). We need to change the mentality of fashion. Style is about how you present your clothes, how you rework them to express individuality. It is about buying special items that last a lifetime and curating outfits. It doesn\u2019t always have to mean new.\n\nBut shopping for second-hand clothing can be even more exciting than the release of endorphins that unwrapping tissue paper, tearing off labels or cutting into cardboard boxes brings. The joy of rifling through a vintage store and finding something only you are likely to own appeals far more than turning up to a wedding to find that you\u2019re one of three women in that Whistles must-have. The increasing popularity of resale sites like Depop demonstrates this.\n\nI\u2019ve always donated my old clothes to charity \u2013 I find it hard to believe that around 300,000 tonnes of clothing ends up in household bins every year, with 20 per cent of it going to landfill. It feels completely absurd that people would throw things like this away, when other people can delight in them. Last year, it was revealed that Burberry had been burning \u00a328.6m worth of clothes that had been unsold \u2013 something the brand says it is no longer doing.\n\nSartorial elitists may say we should only buy from respectable brands with Parisian ateliers and hand-stitching \u2013 but it\u2019s much harder to actually interrogate brands about their supply chains, question manufacturing methods and demand change.\n\nYet while it\u2019s easy for us to turn our nose up at \u00a32 T-shirts and flimsy fabrics that fall apart after one wear, we\u2019d do well to remember that fast fashion democratised trends. It made them available to a mass market at affordable prices in a way it wasn\u2019t before. And it isn\u2019t new. Designers as early as the 1920s were finding ways of creating garments that people could easily copy \u2013 whether that be to make them at home with cut-out patterns in more affordable fabrics, or to buy them from department stores. It feels all too easy to dismiss the high street in such discussions.\n\nExtinction Rebellion is aiming to have London Fashion Week cancelled. But the answer isn\u2019t as simple as a blanket boycott. The fashion industry is worth \u00a332bn to the British economy, it provides jobs for almost as many people as the financial sector and \u2013 vitally \u2013 it is one of the most female-dominated industries in the world; an industry that gave women previously unthinkable autonomy and independence.\n\nRecent trends for alternatives such as fake leather and faux fur are also confusing to consumers. Do we choose the ethical or the environmental? Because they aren\u2019t one and the same. Dr Martens has seen a 70 per cent revenue increase since introducing its vegan leather, but often faux leather is made from ground oil. Animal rights campaigners reject wool, but acrylic alternatives are packed with micro plastics. Of course, the acrylic versions are cheaper and more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nThis summer, Britons apparently purchased more than 50 million outfits to be worn once and then discarded. Influencer culture has increased this pressure to renew. Trends are turning over at an extreme velocity, and the pressure on designers to produce upwards of eight collections a year has led to designer burnout.\n\nThe 1951 film The Man in the White Suit, sees a chemist design an everlasting, dirt-repelling fabric. The realisation that this would mean the end of the rag trade sees the chemist chased out by the unions at the end of the film. While an extreme caricature of the industry, ultimately, this is a dilemma that brands have been faced with \u2013 and they\u2019ve responded to it badly.\n\nThe industry has a lot to answer for. Sustainable options are available and recent moves by the likes of Wrangler and Lee to pioneer sustainable methods of denim dying, as well as 3D-printing and the use of recycled fabrics are positive moves. Brands such as Net-a-Porter, Zara and H&M have all made recent moves towards promoting sustainability.\n\nStella McCartney and Vivienne Westwood have long been at the vanguard of rejecting the ethos of disposable fashion, too.\n\nBut the onus to end fast fashion cannot be placed on the consumer alone. As consumers, we have a responsibility to return to the Make Do and Mend mentality of wartime, but not all consumers have the time to research the origins and longevity of their clothes \u2013 we need systemic change from the industry.", "description": "It has become very fashionable, of late, to proclaim that you hate fast fashion.
