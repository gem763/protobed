Next week we\u2019ll ask, \u201cHow do you view the rise of vaping and e-cigarettes? How should the law view it?\u201d Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Sept. 17. The best responses will be published that night.\n\nLife Through a Lens\n\nTechnology has in many ways have made life easy\u2014certainly much easier than before. So why did one recent study find that the rate of moderate to severe depression among U.S. college students rose from 23.2% in 2007 to 41.1% in 2018, while rates of moderate to severe anxiety jumped from 17.9% in 2013 to 34.4% in 2018? I think technology itself may be to blame for the rise.\n\nMy generation grew up around smartphones. We are accustomed to receiving instant gratification. By pressing a few buttons we can have meals delivered to our homes; receive step-by-step directions to our destinations; and even find people to date. This ability to satisfy our wants and needs instantly has created a tendency in many of us to panic when faced with real problems. We often lack the ability to grind through adversity, as we\u2019ve come to expect quick and easy solutions. When things don\u2019t go smoothly right away, they can seem hopeless.\n\n\u201c Social media provides a filtered view of our friends and peers\u2014the good shines through while the bad stays hidden. This can make us feel as if everyone is happier than we are, as if we\u2019re the only ones with problems, and as if our problems can\u2019t be solved. That\u2019s a recipe for stress, anxiety and depression. \u201d\n\nWe also compare our lives constantly with only the best of others\u2019 lives. Social media provides a filtered view of our friends and peers\u2014the good shines through while the bad stays hidden. This can make us feel as if everyone is happier than we are, as if we\u2019re the only ones with problems, and as if our problems can\u2019t be solved. That\u2019s a recipe for stress, anxiety and depression.\n\n\u2014 Alexander Brent, University of Tennessee, law\n\nReady as I\u2019ll Never Be\n\nThe typical college student arrives on campus after 18 years of being scheduled and micromanaged by parents. College preparation begins at least at age 5, when kids can be shuttled from activity to activity\u2014apparently that\u2019s what \u201csuccessful parents\u201d must do. This intensity doesn\u2019t let up. In fact, it becomes a form of competition earlier than most realize. Guided by their parents, students race to assemble a record of extravagant extracurricular participation and impressive test scores. Perhaps most important are the \u201cunique\u201d accomplishments that can \u201cset you apart\u201d from the crowd, even though the crowd is chasing uniqueness as hard as you are. It need not ever be said aloud that one\u2019s performance in accumulating achievements and involvements is the relevant barometer of success, the one that matters.\n\nThat\u2019s enough to make anyone feel depressed and anxious. Scratch that. It was enough to make me and others I know depressed and anxious and worse.\n\n\u2014 Elizabeth Hildebrandt, University of Toledo, political science\n\nUnhealthy Competition\n\nAttention is the basic commodity of social media. One gives and receives it in the form of likes, shares, subscribers and up-votes. This is inherently competitive and comparative: If you receive more than me, you have higher status.\n\nHealthy competition has rules, written or unwritten, to regulate behavior and establish a baseline of civility and dignity for the participants. Think of most sports. Sadly, competition on social media is anything but healthy. Social-media users can say or do almost anything to get ahead. They often use aggressive tactics such as publicly shaming a rival, or even a bystander, for the approval of the crowd. Seeking that same approval, others will go to the opposite extreme by revealing deeply personal information about themselves, or sharing provocative photos. In this type of competition, normal and healthy behavior falls flat because it doesn\u2019t draw as much attention as unhealthy, mean or narcissistic behavior. Guess which type social-media users are encouraged to exhibit?\n\nSocial media is a game that hooks us with a constant stream of information but allows us to undermine our own dignity through constant comparison of lives and ruthless competition for attention.\n\n\u2014 Matthew Downey, Loyola University Chicago, accounting, economics and finance\n\nUnder Pressure\n\nA college degree no longer guarantees the economic security it once did, though the price of college has skyrocketed. Start there to understand the emotional turmoil many students are facing.\n\nCollege is so expensive that students feel as if they have to be perfect. Otherwise, they might think they\u2019re failing themselves and their families, who have invested so much in them and their futures. Students feel tremendous pressure to earn high grade-point averages, but they also take on extensive extracurricular responsibilities and chase the enviable social life that the \u201ccollege experience\u201d is supposed to promise.\n\nStudents today do everything they can to make the sacrifices of paying tuition seem worthwhile, but the uncertainty of the investment and the debt they are piling up loom over everything. The stress can be debilitating, especially after something starts to go wrong\u2014a bad grade, a breakup, or the simple realization that time is running out on your college years. Maybe it\u2019s not healthy for the stakes to feel so high.\n\n\u2014 Emily Kaib, Vanderbilt University, economics and public policy\n\nClick here to submit a response to the next Future View.", "description": "What\u2019s causing it?
