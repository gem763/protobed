(NOAA/GOES-EAST)\n\n\"There is a chance this system could attempt to become an organized tropical system this week,\" AccuWeather Hurricane Expert Dan Kottlowski said.\n\nThis system will track to the west-northwest toward the Cabo Verde Islands early this week, bringing an uptick in gusty squalls and rough surf.\n\nHowever, by midweek this system is likely to meet its demise as it encounters strong wind shear to the north of the islands.\n\nMeanwhile, over the southwestern Caribbean, an area of low pressure has formed amid a broad counter-clockwise wind pattern, known as a gyre.\n\n\"This area of low pressure will track into or along the north coast of Central America early this week,\" Kottlowski said.\n\nIf the system's circulation remains over the warm waters of the Gulf of Honduras for a time, there will be a better chance for it to become an organized tropical system.\n\nDrenching showers and thunderstorms are likely over portions of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Belize, Guatemala and the Yucatan Peninsula into Tuesday, even if an organized tropical system fails to form.\n\nThis disturbance is expected to cross the Yucatan Peninsula and emerge in the Bay of Campeche by midweek. Here, there may be another opportunity for it to organize.\n\nRegardless, drenching flooding rainfall will be possible in portions of eastern Mexico during the second half of the week. Some of this rain could be drawn northward into the western Gulf Coast.\n\nHurricane season continues until the end of November, and Kottlowski believes there will be another named system or two over the Atlantic Ocean before the season comes to a close.\n\nThe next names on the list for the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season are Nestor and Olga.\n\nForecasters are also keeping an eye on the East Pacific basin this week.\n\nThe window will soon close for a disorganized cluster of showers and thunderstorms south of the Baja California peninsula to develop into a tropical depression or storm.\n\nOf greater concern may be another area of disturbed weather located a couple hundred miles west of the coasts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica.\n\nThis satellite image shows clusters of showers and thunderstorms off the west coast of Central America on Sunday morning, Oct. 13, 2019. (NOAA/GOES-EAST)\n\nThis feature may become a tropical depression or storm as it parallels the southern coast of Mexico this week.\n\n\"This tropical threat may bring the risks of flooding and damaging winds to parts of southern and western Mexico,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Eric Leister said.\n\nThe next names on the list for the 2019 East Pacific hurricane season are Octave and Priscilla.\n\nDownload the free AccuWeather app to see the latest track maps and advisories for tropical systems all across the globe.
