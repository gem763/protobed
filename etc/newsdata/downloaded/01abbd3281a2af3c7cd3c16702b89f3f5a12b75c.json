Hillary Clinton was pitched similarly, as the standard bearer of the Obama-era status quo keen to deliver four more years of the same. And her campaign was mired in one ginned-up scandal after another: but her emails! Her health! Bill! Each was more absurd and sexist than the last. That didn\u2019t change the fact that she had skeletons in her closet, racked up over a long career in the public eye. Or that there were a lot of people ambivalent about her decades of experience in American politics \u2013 and eager for a fresh face. There are many reasons why Clinton did not become president, but the right\u2019s ability to weaponize her past as a consummate Beltway insider didn\u2019t help.\n\nThe gamble of a Biden nomination, then, is a big one. It\u2019s a bet on whether Americans really do want a return to the political establishment when signs here and around the world seem to be pointing in the opposite direction, empowering both far-right strong men and socialists as center-left and center-right parties stumble. Biden\u2019s chances in a general election also hinge whether he can muster support from enough Obama-loyal, reliable primary voters to counteract a lack of enthusiasm among younger and more progressive segments of the electorate, who won\u2019t back him with nearly the same vim as they would Elizabeth Warren or (especially) Bernie Sanders.
