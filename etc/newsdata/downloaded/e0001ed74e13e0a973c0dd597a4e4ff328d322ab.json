One candidate carries a Louis Vuitton handbag; another, an unidentifiable bag. You might feel the candidate with the luxury-brand bag is better connected and more able to promote the business. Now imagine you\u2019re interviewing kindergarten teachers for your school. Which candidate will better care for youngsters?\n\nA large body of research has shown that luxury brands convey wealth, high social standing and power. Status is a central core of luxury-goods marketing. But two researchers at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management recently asked if wearing luxury brands can ever backfire. That is, might there be a social cost to flashing a Gucci or Burberry logo?\n\nIt turns out there can be a social cost to luxury goods, particularly when it comes to first impressions of the sort created during job interviews. Research suggests that job seekers should carefully consider the messages that a Rolex watch, logo leather goods and other luxury products convey in a particular setting. When a job requires trustworthiness, empathy, likability or kindness, luxury goods might best be left behind.\n\n\u201cThe brands we choose to adorn ourselves with signal rank,\u201d says Derek Rucker, a Kellogg marketing professor who conducted the study, which was published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, with Ph.D. candidate Chris Cannon. However, high status isn\u2019t desirable for every job. \u201cThere\u2019s a dark side,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to ask, what am I wearing and in front of whom?\u201d\n\nStatus vs. warmth\n\nTo explore these complex reactions, Dr. Rucker and Mr. Cannon devised four experiments\u2014three conducted with paid subjects who participated online, and one in which Northwestern undergrads came to a lab to participate. In one experiment, 120 male and female participants were shown identical photos of a man in a T-shirt. In one case the T-shirt had no logo. In others, the shirt had a Gucci logo (the researchers chose Gucci because it ranks among the top luxury brands globally).\n\nThe participants were then asked to rate the man on various characteristics such as social status, class, warmth and caring. Participants rated the Gucci-logo man lower for traits like warmth, trustworthiness and kindness but as having higher status. They also felt that the Gucci man was trying hard to manage their impression of him.\n\nThe researchers then replicated the experiment with 120 different men and women, this time using identical photos of a woman with a handbag\u2014one unmarked, the other a Burberry bag with its trademark plaid pattern. Similarly, participants rated the woman with the Burberry bag to have higher status but lower warmth.\n\nDelving further, 115 undergraduates were asked to review questionnaires filled out by candidates for a business simulation, and to select the candidate with whom they would most like to work. The questionnaires were identical except that some mentioned luxury-brand names\u2014Prada, Rolex, Burberry, Porsche\u2014in the candidates\u2019 answers.\n\nIt turned out that the students preferred to work with the luxury-brand candidate for a publicity job, but picked the nonluxury-brand candidate for the human-resources job. \u201cPeople were choosing based on whether status or warmth were necessary\u201d for the job, Mr. Cannon says.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it seems people ascribe motives to others who wear luxury brands. Participants who believed the brands were flashed to influence how they felt about the person\u2014what the researchers called \u201cimpression management\u201d\u2014felt most strongly that those candidates lacked warmth, trustworthiness and kindness.\n\nWhen impressions count\n\nThese findings may back up research at the University of Michigan in 2018 that found that status symbols such as luxury goods can block the formation of new friendships. It turned out that many people found the status-signaling to be a turnoff.\n\nThese findings counter a wide body of belief and research into the benefits of luxury goods and wardrobes. Numerous studies have explored the status-defining powers of brands. Dutch researchers Rob Nelissen and Marijn Meijers in 2011 found that luxury brands elicited preferential treatment and even financial benefits in a series of experiments published in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior.\n\nThe latest results caused the researchers to reconsider their own appearances. Dr. Rucker says he thought, \u201cWhen I go in the classroom, how do my students perceive what I wear?\u201d He began to consider his own impression management, such as explaining why he was wearing a nice watch, so students wouldn\u2019t assume he was trying to impress them.\n\nWhen wearing expensive products into situations where impressions count, he suggests considering whether signaling high status will be a benefit or a hindrance.\n\n\u201cIn hiring, these symbols can be misinterpreted,\u201d Dr. Rucker says. \u201cThese symbols have power. There\u2019s a dark side that\u2019s pretty complex.\u201d\n\nMs. Binkley is a writer in Los Angeles.
