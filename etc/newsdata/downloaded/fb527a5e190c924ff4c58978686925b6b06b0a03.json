Similarly, it\u2019s difficult to see what Warren would get from throwing her support to Sanders. Even if Warren were promised the vice presidency on a Sanders-Warren ticket, Democratic voters who are excited by her might be dismayed to see a woman of color\u2014if you credit Warren\u2019s claim to Native American ancestry\u2014stepping aside to play a merely supporting role. Warren herself might resist the idea and prefer to persist in the quest to make history as the first woman president.\n\nEven if Sanders or Warren somehow managed to win the Democratic nomination, they\u2019d have to defeat President Trump actually to make it to the presidency. That wouldn\u2019t be easy. An incumbent president running for reelection hasn\u2019t been defeated since Bill Clinton beat George H.W. Bush in 1992. Trump will seize the opportunity to define his opponents: \u201ccrazy Bernie,\u201d \u201cPocahontas.\u201d\n\nAnd even if Sanders or Warren somehow did manage to defeat Trump and win election as president of the United States, the former Burlington, Vermont, mayor or the former Harvard law professor would have a hard time fully implementing a socialist or \u201cbig structural change\u201d program in a system that requires 60 Senate votes for a lot of legislation.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ira Stoll", "Reason.Com Could-A-Warren-Sander-Team-Up-Topple-Biden"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
