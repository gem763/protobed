This is such an unprecedented situation that there just aren\u2019t rules for how Congress can deal with this. Withhold funding from the intelligence community? Maybe, but that\u2019s politically and arguably practically risky. Subpoena documents and hold hearings with officials withholding the information? That hasn\u2019t made the Trump administration more forthcoming in half a dozen other investigations.\n\nAfter weeks of investigating the whistleblower complaint at the heart of this and not getting more information, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) is seriously considering supporting the impeachment inquiry of Trump already going on in the House. He\u2019s just out of options, he seemed to say. \u201cThat may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,\u201d Schiff told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sounds more open to it.\n\nHere\u2019s what she wrote members of Congress in a letter this weekend, my emphasis added: \u201cIf the administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the president, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\u201d\n\nThe House\u2019s Judiciary committee is already conducting an impeachment inquiry (the first step to drawing up articles of impeachment). But Pelosi has refused to publicly acknowledge how official that investigation has become and has refused to publicly describe it for what it is, an \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s willing to go there soon if the Trump administration doesn\u2019t let the intelligence community inspector general share what he knows with the House and Senate intelligence communities. Having Pelosi\u2019s support for the ongoing impeachment inquiry, rather than arguing about whether it exists, could help focus the sometimes messy process.\n\nThe pro-impeachment camp is ramped up even more.\n\nAs impeachment skeptics within the House Democratic caucus are starting to reconsider their stance, the Democrats who support an impeachment inquiry (or even outright impeachment of Trump) are getting louder.\n\nThis group has been putting pressure on Pelosi since Democrats won back the House majority last year. Judging by their comments over the weekend, expect this caucus to get even more urgent. Here\u2019s a sampling.\n\nAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 22, 2019\n\n\u201cWe have said the president must be held accountable, and \u2018no one is above the law,\u2019 including the president of the United States,\u201d Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.) told The Post\u2019s Rachael Bade and Josh Dawsey. \u201cWe have to not only say that; our actions have to reflect that.\u201d\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\nEven though a majority of House Democrats support an impeachment inquiry, it\u2019s not clear they have the votes among themselves to actually impeach Trump. The stronger the pro-impeachment-inquiry crowd is, the more sway they will have over the whole caucus.\n\nThe Republicans who aren\u2019t spinning for Trump are \u201ctroubled\u201d\n\nPer usual during a Trump-centered scandal, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) is one of the only Republican lawmakers offering a modicum of criticism.\n\nRomney tweeted Sunday: \u201cIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out.\u201d\n\nAnd Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) declined to directly criticize Trump, but he did talk about it in the abstract this way: \u201cIt is not appropriate for any candidate for federal office, certainly, including a sitting president, to ask for assistance from a foreign country. That\u2019s not appropriate. But I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s what happened here.\u201d\n\nWhat Republicans aren\u2019t publicly acknowledging is that an inspector general, who is an independent watchdog for a government agency and has no known reason to be partisan, found the allegation about a sitting president both credible and \u201curgent\u201d and told Congress his conclusion did not come from just one conversation.\n\nWe are not saying we expect the Republican-controlled Senate to hold a trial and kick Trump out of office. But one missing piece of impeachment is that a majority of Americans, including a majority of independents, don\u2019t support it. If more Republicans were open about their concerns about what Trump is alleged to have done, the House will feel it has a much stronger case for impeachment.", "description": "It has the potential to push House Democratic skeptics over the line.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/31lI0nXr7G3Ms4A1r7rMyTcvjRc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5JM3VJW5UUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
