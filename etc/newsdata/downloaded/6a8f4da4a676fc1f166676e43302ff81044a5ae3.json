(AP) \u2014 The first all-female spacewalk is back on, six months after a suit-sizing flap led to an embarrassing cancellation.\n\nNASA announced Friday that the International Space Station\u2019s two women will pair up for a spacewalk later this month. Astronauts Christina Koch and the newly arrived Jessica Meir will venture out Oct. 21 to plug in new, upgraded batteries for the solar power system.\n\nIt will be the fourth of five spacewalks for battery work. The first is Sunday; Koch will go out with Andrew Morgan.\n\nKoch was supposed to do a spacewalk with another female crewmate in March. But NASA had to scrap the plan just a few days in advance because there wasn\u2019t enough time to get a second medium-size spacesuit ready. The second medium was put together on board in June.\n\nNASA\u2019s deputy chief astronaut Megan McArthur told reporters the all-female spacewalk will be a milestone. But she noted that women are so integrated at all levels at NASA now that they don\u2019t tend to dwell on gender.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll sit back and reflect on it, as we all will. We will all celebrate that,\u201d McArthur said.\n\nKoch and Meir, a marine biologist who arrived at the orbiting lab last week, are both members of NASA\u2019s Astronaut Class of 2013, the first and only one with an even split between men and women. They\u2019re also both making their first spaceflights.\n\nKoch, an electrical engineer, is more than 200 days into an approximately 300-day mission, which will set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman.\n\n\u201cIn the past, women haven\u2019t always been at the table,\u201d Koch said during a televised interview earlier this week. \u201cAnd it\u2019s wonderful to be contributing to the human spaceflight program at a time when all contributions are being accepted, when everyone has a role, and that can lead, in turn, to increased chance for success.\u201d\n\nSince the world\u2019s first spacewalk in 1965, only 14 women have done them, versus 213 men, according to NASA.\n\nExpect more women spacewalking together on the horizon.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that over the next couple years, we\u2019re having a lot of medium suit people fly,\u201d said NASA\u2019s space station program manager, Kirk Shireman.\n\nKoch will serve as the lead spacewalker for Sunday\u2019s excursion with Morgan, her U.S. male crewmate. There are 11 spacewalks coming up in the next few months - 10 U.S. and one Russian. Only one is two women.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
