We will look at the challenge that Wales pose in the pack,\" Proudfoot told media on Tuesday.\n\n\"There have been various reasons for choosing the 6/2 split in previous matches \u2013 different reasons for different opposition.\n\n\"But we will have a look at that before we pick our side. We will look at what injuries we have\u2026 how the guys are holding up physically. Then we will make the call accordingly.\"\n\nProudfoot added that the Boks were mindful of how strong this Welsh side is, especially up front.\n\n\"We handle every pack with the utmost respect. They are ranked third in the world, and Six Nations champions. They\u2019re a fantastic defensive outfit, so they are a very formidable pack,\" he said.\n\n\"They have one of the most experienced Test captains around \u2013 he\u2019s been there a long time.\n\n\"That pack has been the heartbeat of the British and Irish Lions pack that\u2019s been to New Zealand.\n\n\"So, to go there and win a test match, you\u2019ve got to be a formidable side. We look at what the opposition has and we work from there.\n\n\"We had a good session this morning with the pack of forwards and are looking forward to the challenge.\"\n\nKick-off on Sunday is at 11:00 (SA time).\n\n- Compiled by Lloyd Burnard", "description": "Springbok assistant coach Matthew Proudfoot says that a 6/2 bench split is possible for Sunday's Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Wales in Yokohama.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9376/8da66f11f8894faf99194a16c4a40772.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
