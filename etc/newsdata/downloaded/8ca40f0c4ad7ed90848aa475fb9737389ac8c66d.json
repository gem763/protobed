She and my father owned a small business, which she decided to sell upon his death, as she is in her early 70s and no longer wants to deal with the business.\n\nMy mom and dad were quite successful and put a lot of money away over the years, totaling approximately $3 million. My mom\u2019s estate will be divided among her three children equally upon her passing.\n\nMy sister has taken over the majority of my mom\u2019s financial matters as well, and she is paying my sister to do so.\n\nI have a sister who worked for my parents for a long time in the family business, which overlapped into their personal finances. My sister has taken over the majority of our mom\u2019s financial matters as well, and our mom is paying my sister to do so.\n\nIt makes me very uncomfortable that just one sibling has access to all of our mom\u2019s finances. We have no idea what she is being paid or if she and our mom are making the best financial decisions.\n\nSince we are all equal beneficiaries of her estate, I feel we should all know what is going on. If my mom doesn\u2019t want to do that, then the next best thing would be to choose a neutral person outside the family and pay that person instead.\n\nMy mom is happy with how things are, and doesn\u2019t feel the need to involve anyone else in the matter. What would you suggest is the best way to deal with this situation?\n\nJustin\n\nDear Justin,\n\nYour letter comes at a good time. Not for me, but for you. It\u2019s better to preempt any financial malfeasance or even unintentional poor decisions. I receive far too many letters about misdeeds and skullduggery after they\u2019ve occurred, and it\u2019s always more difficult to fix the problem after the fact. Transparency and accountability should be the cornerstones of all such dealings, especially those related to family finances. The question is: Who is your mother accountable to?\n\nYour situation reminds me of this previous letter I received from a sister who was iced out of her mother\u2019s financial affairs. They lived in different states, for a start, so she was attempting to manage a situation from afar. Also, her mother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, so she was vulnerable and needed help. This woman had not seen her mother in over a decade, so she needed to take responsibility for that. All of that is to say: For you, things could be a lot worse.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: My sister-in-law is a greedy, gold-digging woman \u2014 it floored me that men could be so stupid\n\nBut back to you: You are walking a fine line here. You want to protect your mother from any bad decisions, intentional or otherwise, and you want to protect your own inheritance. However, I urge you to check your motivations before having this conversation, and to ask yourself whether you are acting in your mother\u2019s best interest, your own best interest, or both. Rather than airing your concerns and alarming your mother, ask her if you may make suggestions.\n\nIf you have reason to believe that something is amiss, that\u2019s another story. The National Center on Elder Abuse, a government agency affiliated with the U.S. Administration on Aging, reports that financial exploitation is a \u201cfast-growing problem. It commonly involves a trusted person. They include caretakers, family members, neighbors, friends, attorneys, bank employees and, yes, even leaders of religious organizations, and doctors and nurses.\n\nIf that were the case, your mother would be better off hiring a financial adviser who has a fiduciary duty to act in her best interests. Do not walk into this situation from a position of fear or mistrust. Keep an open mind. Has your mother written a will? How is the business going? What oversights are in place to monitor all the transactions? Does your mother have a lawyer or accountant involved? Are there enough checks and balances? Your first question should not be, \u201cWhat about our inheritance?\u201d\n\nYour first question should be, \u201cHow can I help?\u201d\n\nAlso see: My fianc\u00e9\u2019s father is custodian of his IRA \u2014 how can I get him to relinquish control?\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?
