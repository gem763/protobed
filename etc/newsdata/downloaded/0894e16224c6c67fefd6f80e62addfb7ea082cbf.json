Boris Johnson will be hoping nobody looks too closely at his sleight of hand yesterday.\n\nThe Prime Minister received lots of plaudits for getting the EU to reopen the withdrawal agreement and sign a new deal. Those who just want Brexit done will be grateful he\u2019s got any form of agreement.\n\nJohnson is counting on them not reading the small print.\n\nThe way he presented the deal was a masterly piece of showmanship. It disguised the fact he had replaced the Irish backstop with a mechanism that could leave Northern Ireland locked into EU rules for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt is far more economically damaging than Theresa May \u2019s deal (or no Brexit at all) and could see GDP shrink by up to 7% over a decade.\n\nSafeguards on workers\u2019 rights and the environment have been shifted from the withdrawal agreement to the political declaration.\n\nThis means they are no longer locked down by treaty and can be swept away by a Tory government. All these factors will matter when MPs vote in the Commons tomorrow.\n\nThe DUP are furious at the way Northern Ireland has been annexed and Labour will not vote for anything that hands bosses the whip hand over workers and opens the door to US health firms raiding the NHS.\n\nJohnson\u2019s path to victory relies on the Tory Eurosceptics who sabotaged May\u2019s deal accepting a repackaged version by a fellow Brexiteer.\n\nEven if they fall into line it still leaves him needing the 21 Tory MPs he stripped from the whip and a dozen or so Labour or independents.\n\nMany MPs understand the public\u2019s fatigue with Brexit and could vote for the deal to make the issue go away.\n\nThe PM is gambling by assuming that the majority share this view.", "description": "The Prime Minister has brought a deal back from Brussels that could see GDP shrink by up to 7% over a decade.", "authors": ["Jason Beattie"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20644114.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS196174595.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
