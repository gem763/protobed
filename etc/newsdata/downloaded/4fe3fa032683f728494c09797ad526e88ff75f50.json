I don\u2019t know, what is considered time? Who says it\u2019s time? I mean look, it\u2019s a young man\u2019s sport. Make that money. Make that money. If there\u2019s $20 million for everyone to make, go make that money.\u201d\n\nPyle, a 19-fight UFC veteran, currently is assisting with coaching at Syndicate MMA in Las Vegas and is enjoying the role of passing down his knowledge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of stuff stored in my noodle,\u201d Pyle said. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve learned a lot, and learned a lot from my teammates, and I like to pass it on to our stewards of the sport \u2013 and it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s fun to help them (and) see them develop. I\u2019m just helping a bit here and there you know.\u201d", "description": "UFC veteran Mike Pyle would like to see Jon Jones vs. Israel Adesanya and thinks fighters should go out and make money while they can.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "George Garcia", "Mma Junkie Staff", "The Blue Corner", "John Morgan", "Nolan King", "Dan Tom"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/off-guard-mike-pyle.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
