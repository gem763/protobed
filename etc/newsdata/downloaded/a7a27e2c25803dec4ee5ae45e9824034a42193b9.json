(Al Bello/Getty Images)\n\nThe Redskins lost the game and lost their franchise quarterback as Griffin, who is still in the NFL as a backup to Lamar Jackson in Baltimore, was never able to regain the form that made him a Pro Bowler and the NFL offensive rookie of the year in 2012.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, who have a dynamic young quarterback of their own in reigning NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes, would be wise to use Griffin as a cautionary tale.\n\nLess than 10 days ago during a Thursday Night Football game against the Denver Broncos, Mahomes, who was already dealing with an ankle injury, dislocated his right kneecap while executing a quarterback sneak.\n\nRelated: What\u2019s the Deal With Patrick Mahomes\u2019s Ketchup Obsession?\n\nWhile it was debatably foolish enough to run that sort of play with a hobbled Mahomes in the first place, the Kansas City Chiefs are on the verge of compounding that mistake tenfold.\n\nMahomes, who was initially given a minimum of a three-week timetable to return to the field after an MRI revealed no structural damage, is already back taking reps at practice. Though he\u2019s been ruled out of Sunday\u2019s game against the Packers, Mahomes could play in Week 9 against the Vikings.\n\nIf the Chiefs allow him to, they are playing with fire.\n\nToday\u2019s Pat Mahomes practice video pic.twitter.com/jd4sFkGvmn \u2014 Adam Teicher (@adamteicher) October 25, 2019\n\nMahomes, 24, is arguably the most valuable asset in the NFL and needs to be treated as such. By playing him so soon after an injury, the Chiefs would be valuing short-term success over long-term viability, a very Redskin-ian way of running a football team.\n\n\u201cAnytime you dislocate something, you\u2019re at increased risk for doing it again,\u201d Dr. Steven Struhl, an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in shoulder and knee-related injuries and conditions, tells InsideHook. \u201cIt\u2019s such a violent injury, that when you have a dislocation, something\u2019s got to give. Something\u2019s got to rip. When it rips, now you have less soft tissue constraints and the chances you could do it again go up, especially when you don\u2019t have surgery to correct the damage. Even though there was no structural damage picked up by the MRI, he probably did stretch the ligaments to a degree, so they\u2019re probably not perfectly normal and there is an increased risk.\u201d\n\nDr. Struhl points out that Mahomes was very fortunate to dislocate his kneecap and get away with no structural damage. That won\u2019t happen twice.\n\n\u201cIf he does it again, he won\u2019t be so lucky. The chances that he rips something are much higher. He could also shear off a piece of a bone when it goes from being dislocated to not dislocated. That creates a number of problems. Redislocating it would almost surely create a surgical problem. \u201c\n\nThey can\u2019t keep him in bubble wrap forever, but a surgical problem is exactly the type of problem the Chiefs will want to avoid with a game-breaking quarterback like Mahomes. Give him the time he needs to heal completely \u2014 and then give him a little more. Don\u2019t even think about putting him back on the field before he\u2019s ready. It isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nJust ask Griffin.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.", "description": "The Kansas City Chiefs, who have a dynamic young quarterback in reigning NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes, would be wise to use Robert Griffin as a cautionary tale.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1181735379-e1571950323660.jpg?fit=944%2C629", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
