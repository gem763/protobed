It felt like it was only a matter of time before they made one count.\n\nPep Guardiola will have been alarmed by Manchester City's passing against Wolves\n\nThe opening goal saw Nicolas Otamendi dive in as Raul Jimenez ghosted by the centre back before squaring the ball to Adama Traore to score. That was poor by Otamendi. It was a panicked action, like a boxer throwing a wild punch.\n\nBut that counter-attack ultimately came as a result of Joao Cancelo giving the ball away cheaply. City's carelessness in possession will have alarmed Guardiola as much as the defending.\n\nAt the back, Fernandinho has been forced into central defence due to John Stones and Aymeric Laporte's injuries, and I'm not sure Rodri is an upgrade on him in midfield.\n\nThe visitors' opening goal ultimately came as a result of Joao Cancelo (L) giving the ball away\n\nWolves used two up front and had forwards who wanted to run at City's defence. They made Otamendi look like a rash weak link, and City's upcoming opponents will have noticed that.\n\nI was shocked when Vincent Kompany left in the summer, given his immense contribution last season. I'm still shocked that was allowed to happen now. He was the buffer between the players and the manager. You could trust him to come in and do a job. Now, City don't have that.\n\nFor Liverpool, their next Premier League fixtures read: Manchester United away, Tottenham at home, Aston Villa away, then City at Anfield on November 10. They have an eight-point lead now. They should be believing that they can maintain that advantage ahead of the visit of Guardiola's men, which would then give them a great chance of making it 11. That's the only way Liverpool can think.", "description": "MARTIN KEOWN: The statistics show City committed a total of 81 failed passes on Sunday, and they haven't given the ball away more in a Premier League game this season.", "authors": ["Martin Keown For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/22/19414426-0-image-a-6_1570482925834.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
