(Eric Gay)\n\nThe ninth-ranked Texas Longhorns host No. 6 LSU on Saturday night in Austin. Follow along here for live updates and analysis.\n\nLSU at Texas\n\nWhen: Saturday, 7:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Memorial Stadium, Austin.\n\nLine: LSU by 6.5.\n\nTV: ABC.\n\nStreaming: Watch ESPN.\n\n[Today's college football viewing guide]\n\nPregame reading\n\nThe showdown between the Tigers and Longhorns features two high-profile quarterbacks in the Longhorns\u2019 Sam Ehlinger and the Tigers\u2019 Joe Burrow.\n\nBoth are coming off impressive performances in season-opening wins last weekend.\n\nBurrow matched a school record with five touchdown passes, all in the first half, before exiting after the first series of the third quarter with a 55-3 victory over visiting Georgia Southern well in hand. The redshirt senior did not throw an interception or get sacked.\n\n[For LSU\u2019s long-outdated offense, it\u2019s finally geaux time]\n\nEhlinger completed 28 of 38 passes for 276 yards and four touchdowns without an interception in a 45-14 win against Louisiana Tech, although LSU linebacker K\u2019Lavon Chaisson added some spice to the Saturday\u2019s game, telling reporters:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really find [Ehlinger] too much of a threat. Not taking a shot at him, but he uses his legs more than his arm. Just like high school.\"\n\nTigers Coach Ed Orgeron, however, spoke glowingly about Ehlinger this week, comparing him to a Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback against whom he coached when he was an assistant at Mississippi.\n\n\u201cHe reminds me a little of Tebow,\u201d Orgeron said, referring to Tim Tebow, the former star at Florida. \u201cI was at another school when we had to play Tebow. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s as good as Tebow. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s not. Reminds me of that type of player, but he\u2019s a better thrower.\u201d\n\nLonghorns Coach Tom Herman, meanwhile, is plenty familiar with Burrow, whom he recruited when he served as offensive coordinator at Ohio State. Burrow, a native of Athens, Ohio, served as J.T. Barrett\u2019s backup for two seasons before transferring to LSU.\n\nBurrow also directed the Tigers to 21 points in the first quarter, a feat LSU did not accomplish in any game last season.\n\n\u201cI love Joe,\u201d Herman said during his weekly news conference. \u201cI recruited him. I got to know his family. He\u2019s a coach\u2019s kid. His dad is the [former] defensive coordinator at Ohio University. He reminds me a lot of our guy [Ehlinger]. He\u2019s physically, mentally tough. He\u2019s uber competitive.\u201d\n\nMore college football coverage:\n\nJohn Feinstein: Michigan vs. Army is a guarantee game \u2014 it guarantees worry for both coaches\n\nLiberty Coach Hugh Freeze won\u2019t be lying down on the job anymore\n\nOhio State vs. Cincinnati marks a crossroads, with a connection in New Hampshire\n\nYour college football team rolled in its opener.
