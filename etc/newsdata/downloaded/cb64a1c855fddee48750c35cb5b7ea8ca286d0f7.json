She was immediately pronounced dead on Sunday by emergency responders who found her wrapped in the arms of her injured mother, according to Captain Jason Smith of Homicide Division.\n\nPolice said an unidentified gunman opened fire and shot into the front window and door of the family\u2019s Kensington home in north Philadelphia, seriously injuring the girl\u2019s 24-year-old mother with a gunshot wound to the head and arm and a 33-year-old male contractor who was working in the home, with a gunshot wound to the stomach. Smith said other children and Nicolette\u2018s grandmother were also in the home at the time of the shooting.\n\nSmith told reporters that it is safe to assume that the house was specifically targeted and that the shooter presumed an intended target was inside the house, but that they were not.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He added that preliminary ballistic testing determined the casings in both the shootings came from the same type of assault rifle, which police believe was either an AK-47 or SKS.\n\nLess than 24 hours earlier, an 11-month-old boy was shot four times while he was in a car with his stepmother in the north Philadelphia neighborhood of Hunting Park, only three miles away from Kensington.\n\nCaptain Nicholas Brown of the East Detectives Division told reporters on Monday that police believe the intended target was a third person in the car who remains unidentified at this time. Brown said a 9mm gun was used in the shooting and that the boy was shot once in the back of the head, once in the neck and twice in the buttocks. The boy remains in \u201cvery, very critical condition\u201d with almost no chance of full recovery and will most likely be paralyzed, Brown said, citing doctors.\n\nPolice have still not made an arrest in either shooting and are urging anyone with information about the shootings to come forward. City Managing Director Brian Abernathy said Monday that a $30,000 reward is being offered for information leading to arrest in both of the shootings. The Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 5, a Philadelphia-based police labor union, said they were offering a $5,000 reward for any information leading to an arrest in the shooting of the 11-month old.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, Philadelphia mayor Jim Kenney said he was \u201coutraged, disgusted and heartbroken,\u201d by the shootings.\n\n\u201cPhiladelphians should not live in fear of violence that could take away a child\u2019s life,\u201d Kenney tweeted. \u201cBut for too many, this is a sad reality. With the unabated flow of illegal guns and drugs, we must do whatever we can locally to address violence and help residents.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey said he was praying for the families of the victims and issued support for action on gun reform.\n\nAccording to Philadelphia Police crime statistics, there have been 280 victims of homicide in so far in 2019\u2014 up 4% from the same time last year. In 2018, the city tracked 353 total homicide victims.\n\nWrite to Gina Martinez at gina.martinez@time.com.", "description": "Police said the 2-year-old was shot in her home and the 11-month-old was shot while in a car with his stepmother.", "authors": ["Gina Martinez"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/florida-man-parking-space-shooting.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
