Often these interviews feature trash talk and bold predictions as the tension is ratcheted up ahead of big-time bouts. But MacDonald and Lima looked equally uncomfortable as they nervously chuckled their way through the chat.\n\nThe bad blood might not be present, but both men know how to handle their business inside the cage. And, after their punishing first encounter went all five rounds at Bellator 192 in January 2018, a similarly hard-fought clash is expected this time around.\n\nYou can watch the interview in the video above.", "description": "Rory MacDonald and Douglas Lima went face to face for a rather uncomfortable-looking pre-fight interview.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Dan Tom", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/rory-macdonald-douglas-lima-tbc.jpg?w=640&h=420&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
