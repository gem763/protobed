The club captain trudged off the pitch, before cupping his ear, throwing the armband to the floor and storming down the tunnel having brushed aside the hand of his manager Unai Emery.\n\nXhaka was not the only Arsenal player to be targeted for abuse, however, with last season\u2019s Premier League Golden Boot winner and September\u2019s Player of the Month the target of vitriol as he attempted to make a speedy getaway.\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang won last season\u2019s Premier League Golden Boot and is Arsenal\u2019s top scorer this term (Picture: Twitter)\n\nAubameyang who, like Xhaha, has been left out of the squad for tonight\u2019s Carabao Cup fourth round tie against Liverpool, reacted on Twitter by liking a message of support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Gabon international has scored eight goals in 11 starts this season but has failed to find the back of the next in his last three Premier League appearances.\n\nIn his and Xhaka\u2019s absence at Anfield tonight, meanwhile, Mesut Ozil could wear the captain\u2019s armband with Emery set to hand the 31-year-old a chance to salvage his Arsenal career having been left out of the last six matches altogether.\n\n\u2018We need his quality, his skill and his consistency,\u2019 admitted Emery at his pre-match press conference.\n\n\u2018We need his positive mentality and then he will help us on the pitch. That\u2019s the next step.\n\n\u2018I think he\u2019s done the steps before, and now I want the steps like in pre-season and one month ago to help us on the pitch.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nMORE: Arsenal should consider Patrick Vieira as manager after Unai Emery, believes Nigel Winterburn\n\nMORE: Liverpool vs Arsenal TV channel, live stream, time, odds, team news and head-to-head", "description": "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has responded to the abuse he suffered following Arsenal's draw with Crystal Palace on Sunday by liking a tweet slamming the fan who screamed '\u00a32,000 a year to...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/car-f214_1572444129.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
