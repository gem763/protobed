No matter if you look at WeWork's revenue and expenses, its assets, or just its cash flow, it looks far more like a real-estate company than a typical tech firm.\n\nThe distinction is more than just semantics. The company's valuation in the public markets will be in large part determined by how investors classify it. They tend to be willing to pay a much steeper premium for tech companies than for real-estate firms.\n\nWeWork, or rather The We Company, its corporate parent, certainly pitched itself as a tech firm in the initial-public-offering paperwork it released on Wednesday.

With a $47 billion valuation in the private markets, it's worth more than 15 times its annualized sales for this year, a relatively steep valuation considering it has consistently posted losses.\n\nBut public investors may have a different take. That's because, as its IPO paperwork makes clear, it's not really in the technology business, no matter how many times it tries to wrap itself in that mantle.\n\nHere's what its financial numbers show:", "description": "In its IPO paperwork, WeWork mentioned the word \"technology\" 93 times.
