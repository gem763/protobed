Prices had settled at a two-week high on Friday, with the front-month contract ending 3.6% higher for the week.\n\nThe global benchmark, December Brent crude BRNZ19, -0.32% lost $1.16, or 1.9%, to settle at $59.35 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe after last week\u2019s gain of 3.7%.\n\n\u201cOn the geopolitical front, Saudi Arabia has denied any involvement on last week\u2019s apparent attack on an Iranian oil tanker near the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah,\u201d said Fraser, in a daily note. \u201cIran\u2019s own media reports have offered conflicting accounts, first blaming Saudi Arabia before later withdrawing the claim.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani said the tanker was hit by at least two rockets and there was video footage of the incident, Reuters reported Monday.\n\nBack in Saudi Arabia, \u201cproduction is expected to return near normal levels in the coming weeks as the country looks to restore output lost to attacks on their own oil infrastructure in mid-September,\u201d Fraser said. \u201cWith any disruption to flows and exports confined to the near-term, the market remains hesitant to place any meaningful risk premium on current price benchmarks.\n\nStill, tensions in the Middle East remained high, with Trump vowing Monday that sanctions on Turkey are forthcoming following his recent withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria.\n\nBack on Nymex, November gasoline RBX19, -0.14% fell 1.6% to $1.6132 a gallon after a weekly gain of around 4.2%, while November heating oil HOX19, -0.20% shed 2.2% to $1.9151 a gallon following a rise of 3.3% last week.\n\nNovember natural gas NGX19, +0.44% settled at $2.28 per million British thermal units, up 3%. It lost 5.9% last week.", "description": "Oil futures lose around 2% on Monday, giving back much of their gains from last week, as China has reportedly asked for more talks with the U.S. before...", "authors": ["Myra P.
