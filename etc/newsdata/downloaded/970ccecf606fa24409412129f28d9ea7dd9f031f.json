The blast is thought to have also killed two of his wives.\n\nExplosions and gunfire were reported from the small town of Barisha at about 1.30am Syrian time on Sunday. It is understood that the Isis leader had been tracked to the home of one his bodyguards who attempted to defend him. The raid is thought to have left at least nine people dead.\n\nIraqi state television aired footage on Sunday that it said showed the raid.\n\nPlay Video 0:27 Footage appears to show aftermath of raid targeting Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi \u2013 video\n\nIf confirmed, the death would be a devastating blow to a terror group that had run rampant across the region for five years from mid-2014, spawning gruesome terror attacks across the world, amplifying a mass refugee exodus and sparking a war to contain them that killed thousands of people and displaced millions more.\n\nThroughout that time, Baghdadi remained the face of Isis: a fearsome implacable ideologue who eluded the world\u2019s intelligence agencies while continuing to incite a war of civilisations.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, reported that a squadron of eight helicopters accompanied by a warplane belonging to the international coalition attacked positions of the Hurras al-Deen (an al-Qaida affiliated group) where Isis operatives were believed to be hiding in the Barisha area north of Idlib city.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Syrian man clears debris at the site of helicopter gunfire, which is thought to have killed nine people near Barisha.

An Iraqi intelligence official said the wives of Baghdadi\u2019s two brothers, Jumah and Ahmad, along with other family members, were monitored as they moved to the region. The information was passed to the CIA earlier this month, the officials say.\n\nTelegram accounts linked to Isis were on Sunday offering prayers for Baghdadi, but not confirming his death. The terror group no longer controls territory in Syria or Iraq after a five-year war across much of both countries.\n\nSeveral Syrian rebel groups active in Idlib province say they had been asked by US officials over the past fortnight to establish whether senior Isis members were hiding in Idlib.\n\nIran said it had been informed by Syrian sources that Baghdadi had been killed, two Iranian officials told Reuters on Sunday. \u201cIran was informed about Baghdadi\u2019s death by Syrian officials who got it from the field,\u201d one of the officials said.\n\n\u201cOur sources from inside Syria have confirmed to the Iraqi intelligence team tasked with pursuing Baghdadi that he has been killed alongside his personal bodyguard in Idlib, after his hiding place was discovered when he tried to get his family out of Idlib towards the Turkish border,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nOn Saturday the White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, said Trump planned to make a \u201cmajor statement\u201d on Sunday morning, but gave no further details. It was unclear what the topic of the president\u2019s statement might be.\n\nThe region is mostly held by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group that opposes Isis and routinely executes people thought to be affiliated with the group. Though long speculated to be a possible hideout, Idlib had been thought by many regional officials to be too risky a proposition for Baghdadi who was more accustomed to the deserts of Iraq, where his organisation had risen.\n\nThe death of Baghdadi would be a significant fillip for Trump, who has faced withering criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike for his troop withdrawal from north-eastern Syria, which permitted Turkey to attack the US\u2019s Kurdish allies. He has also repeatedly insisted the US had defeated Isis \u2013 a claim denied by US generals and intelligence leaders.\n\nIsis leader Baghdadi appears in video for first time in five years Read more\n\nMany critics of Trump\u2019s Syria pullout have expressed worries that it would allow Isis to regain strength and pose a threat to US interests. An announcement about Baghdadi\u2019s death could help blunt those concerns.\n\nTrump was expected to make the statement in the White House diplomatic reception room, which he has used to make a number of major announcements. Last week he used the same room to announce that a ceasefire between Turkey and the Kurds had taken hold.\n\nFor days, US officials had feared that Isis would seek to capitalise on the upheaval in Syria. But they also saw a potential opportunity, in which Isis leaders might break from more secretive routines to communicate with operatives, potentially creating a chance for the US and its allies to detect them.\n\nBaghdadi, who has $25m bounty on his head, was long thought to hiding somewhere along the Iraq-Syria border. He has led the group since 2010, when it was still an underground al-Qaida offshoot in Iraq.\n\nOn 16 September, Isis\u2019s media network issued a 30-minute audio message purporting to come from Baghdadi, in which he said operations were taking place daily and called on supporters to free women jailed in camps in Iraq and Syria over their alleged links to his group.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Syrians ride a motorcycle past a burnt vehicle near the northwestern Syrian village of Barisha.
