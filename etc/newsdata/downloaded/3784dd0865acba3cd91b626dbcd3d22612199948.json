The Southern pig-tailed macaque \u2014 or Macaca nemestrina \u2014 is a medium-sized macaque native to Indonesia, Malaysia and southern Thailand. Locally, it is known as the 'beruk'. Males of the species can reach up to 11\u201333 pounds (5\u201315 kg) in weight. They live in groups and predominantly eat fruits, seeds, berries, etc. However, a new study has shown that they enjoy consuming rats. This habit is beneficial in oil palm plantations, where rats are considered to be a significant pest.\n\nZoologist Nadine Ruppert of the Universiti Sains Malaysia and colleagues have been studying the ecology and behaviour of Southern pig-tailed macaques in and around the Segari Melintang Forest Reserve in Peninsular Malaysia since 2016.\n\nThey found that the monkeys seemed to like spending time in the nearby oil palm plantations, which are found across much of the macaques' home range.\n\nThe team learnt that macaques living on the plantations ate a diet mainly composed of oil palm fruit \u2014 with one group eating more than 12 tons of the produce in year.\n\nThis equates to around 0.56 per cent of the total oil palm production across the monkey's entire home range.\n\nHowever, the damage done by the macaques is balanced out by their other choice of delicacy \u2014 rats that would otherwise eat much more of the fruit.\n\n'I was stunned when I first observed that macaques feed on rats in plantations,' said Dr Ruppert.\n\n'I did not expect them to hunt these relatively large rodents or that they would even eat so much meat.'\n\n'They are widely known to be [fruit-eating] primates who only occasionally feast on small birds or lizards.'\n\nThe monkeys are mainly fruit-eaters, but appear to like hanging out on the plantations and supplementing their diets with tasty rodents\n\nPalm oil \u2014 made from the fruit of the oil palm, pictured here in a stock image \u2014 is the most widely used vegetable oil and is found in many processed and packaged foods\n\nUnchecked, the rats are thought to be responsible for losses of up to 10 per cent of oil palm fruit production \u2014 so the macaques' grisly eating habits are good for the local farmers.\n\n'By uncovering cavities in oil palm trunks where rats seek shelter during the day, one group of pig-tailed macaques can catch more than 3,000 rats per year,' said paper author and primatologist Anna Holzner, of the University of Leipzig, Germany.\n\nThe researchers believe that macaques visiting that plantations have the potential to reduce rat numbers by more than 75 per cent.\n\nThis could even allow them to be used to replace the chemicals typically relied on for rodent pest management.\n\nIn fact, the team estimate that the monkey's elimination of the rat pests could reduce crop damage by seven per cent of overall production.\n\nTo put this in perspective, this would save around $650,000 (\u00a3502,000) per year.\n\nThe surprising findings may redeem the macaques' image \u2014 with the monkeys having previously held a reputation instead of being crop-raiding pests themselves\n\n'Our results will encourage both private and public plantation owners to consider the protection of these primates and their natural forest habitat in and around existing and newly established oil palm plantations,' added paper co-author Anja Widdig.\n\n'In collaboration with local palm oil companies and NGOs, we will work towards the realisation of a plantation design that maintains viable macaque populations and higher levels of biodiversity via wildlife corridors,' she added.\n\nThis will be done 'while increasing the plantations' productivity and sustainability by effective and environmentally friendly pest control.'\n\n'This ultimately can lead to a win-win situation for both biodiversity and the oil palm industry.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal Current Biology.", "description": "Zoologists led fromthe Universiti Sains Malaysia have been studying the ecology and behaviour of Southern pig-tailed macaques in the\u00a0Segari Melintang Forest\u00a0Reserve in Malaysia\u00a0since 2016.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20028584-0-image-a-42_1571736852742.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
