That would be Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who joined the supreme court nearly a year ago after a contentious confirmation process in which Dr Christine Blasey Ford told her story of sexual assault by Kavanaugh in high school.\n\nKavanaugh denied her account, and was narrowly confirmed. \u201cSpecifically, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be talking about his penis again,\u201d said Colbert. But a new book published this week by the New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly unearthed new allegations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh: one of his former Yale classmates, Max Stier, told the FBI he recalled seeing Kavanaugh forcing his penis, with the help of his friends, into another female student\u2019s hand during a dorm party in college.\n\n\u201cWith the help of his friends?\u201d Colbert said incredulously. \u201cI can\u2019t even get mine to help me move. I offer penis \u2013\u201d Colbert cut off, doubling over in laughter.\n\nSeveral seconds, a musical interlude and one glasses removal later, Colbert attempted to finish the joke: \u201cI offer pizza with no penis, I promise you.\u201d\n\nJohn Oliver on immigration: for many there is no way to come in the \u2018right way\u2019 Read more\n\nThe woman involved in this latest revelation has remained private, saying she has no recollection of the incident and does not want to be interviewed.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump has predictably defended Kavanaugh online, tweeting over the weekend that Kavanaugh should sue for libel and the justice department \u201cshould come to his rescue\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow does the justice department come to his rescue?\u201d Colbert wondered. \u201cIs William Barr supposed to write a misleading four-page summary of his junk?\u201d\n\nTrevor Noah\n\nOn The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also reacted to new details of alleged misconduct by Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cEvery high school story, or every college story we hear about Brett Kavanaugh, just makes him seem worse and worse,\u201d Noah said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s always something about him exposing himself.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) Brett Kavanaugh, the only Supreme Court justice sponsored by Bud Light, faces another wave of sexual misconduct allegations. pic.twitter.com/4KzupBGYig\n\nFor example, last year, Kavanaugh\u2019s former Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez publicly recalled how, she said, Kavanaugh once thrust his penis in her face at a party. According to Pogrebin and Kelly\u2019s book, Ramirez\u2019s legal team gave the FBI a list of at least 25 people who may have had corroborating evidence, but the FBI did not interview any of them.\n\n\u201cThe FBI ignored 25 former Yale students who could\u2019ve given evidence? That\u2019s insane, because I didn\u2019t know the police also ignored white people,\u201d Noah panned. \u201cThat\u2019s some crazy shit.\u201d\n\nColbert on the Democratic debate: let the 'humble background games' begin Read more\n\nWhich brought Noah to an important question: \u201cWhy the hell was Kavanaugh constantly whipping his dick out at parties?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to wonder if Kavanaugh even understands what parties are,\u201d Noah joked.\n\nAs is custom now, the news triggered typically partisan responses: some Democratic candidates called for his impeachment, while the president tweeted in defense of Kavanaugh.\n\nTrump\u2019s justice department line amused Noah. \u201cI feel like Trump doesn\u2019t really understand how the government works,\u201d he said. \u201cHe acts like the justice department is his own personal emergency line.\u201d\n\nSeth Meyers\n\nOn Late Night, Seth Meyers recapped the latest entries into what he called the administration\u2019s \u201cwar on truth\u201d, starting with a seemingly innocuous story about the vice-president, Mike Pence, getting bitten by a horse.\n\nAt a recent speaking event, Pence said that American Pharoah, the Triple Crown-winning thoroughbred, once nipped his arm during a campaign stop.\n\n\u201cThis story got laughs \u2013 that should\u2019ve been the end of it,\u201d Meyers said. However, this administration has taught us that \u201cnothing \u2013 not even the smallest, most inconsequential equine details can be trusted, because now even the story about being bitten by the horse is being questioned by the horse\u2019s manager\u201d.\n\nAmerican Pharoah\u2019s manager disputed the story \u2013 he had never heard of the incident, he said, calling the bite out of character for such a \u201csweet\u201d horse.\n\n\u201cSo, who are you going to believe? The vice-president or a horse manager?\u201d Meyers asked. \u201cSeriously, I am asking.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in global news, Trump confused world leaders over the weekend by disputing previous, on-the-record statements that he would meet leaders of Iran with \u201cno preconditions\u201d.\n\nThe reversal in openness to Iran, probably has something to do with Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s rival. The country\u2019s leader, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, is a Trump ally, \u201cso last night, Trump threatened an illegal and unconstitutional war with Iran on \u2013 where else? \u2013 Twitter,\u201d Meyers said.\n\nThe whole episode was insane, a chagrined Meyers said. \u201cThe president of the United States \u2013 the guy who spent the entire campaign falsely claiming he wanted to stay out of the United States and would put \u2018America first\u2019 \u2013 just threatened a war with Iran on Twitter and said he was waiting for Saudi Arabia to tell him what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d say this,\u201d he concluded, \u201cbut somebody needs to let American Pharoah loose in the Oval Office.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts address the sexual misconduct allegations against the supreme court justice and Pence\u2019s horse story", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f44da948b57e904cb23843d55e44f6e76b9be1e/102_0_1520_912/master/1520.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6db4a2a2a4dff86d46d364ab9c522e60", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
