The case, brought forth by Nicholas Murray, is one of 13,400 lawsuits related to Risperdal, according to the company's latest SEC filings.\n\nMurray's lawyers claimed the drug, which is prescribed to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other mental health disorders, can create a hormonal imbalance and elevate production of prolactin. The hormone can prompt the formation of female breast tissue in men.\n\nMurray, 26, was awarded compensatory damages of $680,000 in 2015. The $8 billion sum is likely to be reduced on grounds that it violates due process.\n\nRead more: An expert who studies venture capital says the WeWork 'smackdown' won't change the way the industry works \u2014 but he's telling investors how they can avoid the same mistake\n\n\"This award is grossly disproportionate with the initial compensatory award in this case, and the Company is confident it will be overturned,\" J&J said in a statement.\n\nThe firm referenced a 2003 Supreme Court ruling which states punitive damages awards \"that are a double-digit multiplier\" of the compensatory award should be discarded.\n\n\"We will be immediately moving to set aside this excessive and unfounded verdict,\" the company added.\n\nJ&J opened at $130.56 per share Wednesday, up roughly 2% year-to-date.\n\nThe firm has 12 \"buy\" ratings, 11 \"hold\" ratings, and one \"sell\" rating, with a consensus price target of $148.53, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nThird-quarter earnings season is on the horizon.
