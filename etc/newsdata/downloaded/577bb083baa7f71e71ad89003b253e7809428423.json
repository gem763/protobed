I just know that he loves himself more. Again and again, he has harmed the nation\u2019s interests to further his own.\n\nGeopolitical archrival China, fighting us in a trade war, now knows that to secure good relations with the U.S. administration, it should produce dirt on Trump\u2019s prospective Democratic opponent. That\u2019s not in the national interest (it\u2019s flatly against the law). It\u2019s in Trump\u2019s personal interest.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nLikewise, Trump temporarily left Ukraine without U.S. military assistance against Russian aggression while requesting a \u201cfavor\u201d \u2014 furnish dirt on that same political opponent, Joe Biden. That compromised national security for Trump\u2019s electoral purposes.\n\n\n\nTrump and his underlings also sought help from allies Britain, Italy and Australia in debunking special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s findings on Russian election interference.\n\nThe use of government powers for Trump\u2019s interests happens everywhere. Attorney General William Barr, after misleading the public about the Mueller report\u2019s conclusions on Trump\u2019s culpability, launched, at Trump\u2019s request, a major effort to discredit officials who investigated 2016 election interference.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, at Trump\u2019s behest, revived an investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s long-ago emails.\n\nTrump lawyer Rudy Giuliani spearheaded the effort to solicit political dirt from Ukraine .\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ignored the law in refusing access to Trump\u2019s tax returns \u2014 blocking Congress from knowing about Trump\u2019s foreign entanglements.\n\nTrump has encouraged everybody from Vice President Pence on down to patronize his resorts and is now seeking to host the Group of Seven at his Florida golf resort. The General Services Administration ignored constitutional concerns to allow Trump to benefit personally from a government lease.\n\nTrump even pressured federal meteorological officials to rescind weather advice that contradicted his \u2014 much as he pressured the National Park Service to falsify inauguration attendance.\n\nTrump has many undesirable attributes: He lies, he chases conspiracy theories, he\u2019s racist, he abuses power, he\u2019s cruel. The common thread \u2014 a unified theory of Trump, if you will \u2014 is that the man who promised an \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda is instead pursuing a \u201cTrump First\u201d agenda. This is the Me Presidency.\n\nWhy pursue a debunked conspiracy theory absolving Russia of helping him in the 2016 election? Same reason he formed a commission to find popular-vote fraud: He wants to erase the perception that his presidency is illegitimate.\n\nWhy does he give succor to white nationalists? Same reason he befriends strongmen: These people love him, so they must be \u201cvery fine people,\u201d as Trump said after Charlottesville.\n\nWhy does he constantly lie to boost himself and use his public office to boost his private fortune? As was once said of General Motors: What\u2019s good for Trump is good for the country.\n\nHe softened on North Korea after its dictator flattered him in \u201clove letters.\u201d He let nationalist Benjamin Netanyahu have free rein in exchange for such things as naming a fictitious Israeli village after Trump. He blew up an international communique and canceled a trip to Denmark because of perceived personal slights. He shoved a prime minister blocking him from the front row of a photo.\n\nQuestioning another American\u2019s patriotism (Trump routinely accuses critics of \u201ctreason\u201d) can be an ugly business. I\u2019ve reserved this for two: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) (who happily has since retreated from his refusal to protect U.S. elections from foreign tampering) and Trump.\n\nCalling a genuine war hero, John McCain, a \u201closer,\u201d resisting honors for him at death and continuing to attack him posthumously is not patriotic.\n\nUsing the gravestones of fallen U.S. troops as a backdrop when you attack your political opponents on foreign soil is not patriotic.\n\nAttacking Gold Star parents is not patriotic.\n\nAvoiding the wartime draft by claiming bone spurs and then boasting that eluding STDs was your \u201cpersonal Vietnam\u201d is not patriotic.\n\nTaking over the nation\u2019s Independence Day celebration (after a similar attempt at Veterans Day) to honor yourself is not patriotic.\n\nSkipping a military memorial in Europe because it\u2019s raining and a Veterans Day memorial at Arlington National Cemetery because you\u2019re busy is not patriotic.\n\nDefending Vladimir Putin\u2019s murder of journalists by saying, \u201c You think our country is so innocent?\u201d is not patriotic.\n\nTelling the Russian government you don\u2019t care that it interfered in U.S. elections, and siding with Russia\u2019s denials over the conclusions of U.S. intelligence is not patriotic.\n\nSharing intelligence secrets with a foe and inviting election help from foreign governments is not patriotic.\n\nMcCain, a great patriot, spoke often of serving a cause greater than self. Trump has no such cause.\n\nTwitter: @Milbank\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nRead more:\n\nDana Milbank: Trump\u2019s impeachment defense is all alligators and snakes\n\nGreg Sargent: Three awful revelations about Trump in those explosive texts\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump is publicly abusing his oath of office on live television\n\nEugene Robinson: Trump apparently thinks he\u2019s a master at gaslighting\n\nMichael Gerson: Trump\u2019s anti-impeachment rhetoric has already gone too far", "description": "He has a long record of going against his country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAIiISR.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=3188&y=1264", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
