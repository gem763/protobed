Some officials have pushed for tough restrictions as a result of concerns over foreign involvement in critical national infrastructure, while others said this would saddle the telecoms industry with extra costs and delay technological upgrades.\n\nHuawei has become a lightning rod for tensions between the U.S. and Europe over trade and security policy as Washington threatens reprisals against any governments that allow Chinese equipment to form part of the crucial ultrafast networks.\n\nAs the U.K. looks toward trading relationships after Brexit, ministers have been forced to balance the competing demands and opportunities from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration on the one hand, and the lure of possible eastern trade deals on the other.\n\nU.K. intelligence agencies have repeatedly argued that Huawei is a manageable risk --pointing to its embedded oversight board in Oxfordshire, which reports directly to the National Cyber Security Center. But intelligence officials say it\u2019s for politicians to decide whether the company\u2019s oversight is at the correct level.\n\nA meeting of the National Security Council last week discussed the possibility of allowing Huawei access to the \u201cnon-contentious\u201d parts of the network, according to a person familiar with its deliberations. A similar conclusion was reached by Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May.\n\nThe U.K. is seeking a balance between increasing oversight to satisfy the U.S. while allowing Huawei\u2019s continued presence in the British market, according to the official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nBefore being ousted, May had been close to adopting measures which would have allowed carriers to use Huawei in fifth-generation 5G wireless systems while restricting it from some sensitive parts of the network, the person said.\n\nA full ban forcing carriers to \u201crip-and-replace\u201d their existing Huawei technology from the entire network is seen as unlikely. Companies say such a drastic change would take years and cost them hundreds of millions of pounds, with that figure increasing every day they upgrade more masts to 5G.\n\nJohnson pledged to roll out gigabit-per-second broadband speeds to the whole country by 2025 and 5G to a majority by 2027. Huawei is a crucial supplier in both segments, and a market leader in certain product segments, leading some industry executives to question whether his target is feasible if they were removed.\n\nIn July the U.K.\u2019s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport released its long-awaited telecom supply chain review, but left out any firm verdict on Huawei\u2019s role.\n\nParliament is set to be dissolved for an election on Tuesday, triggering rules that restrict government communications and decision-making.\n\n(Updates with detail of NSC meeting in 7th paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Patrick Donahue and Jessica Shankleman.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Kitty Donaldson in London at kdonaldson1@bloomberg.net;Thomas Seal in London at tseal@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Thomas Penny, Stuart Biggs\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. is set to delay a decision on the the role of Huawei Technologies Co. in its fifth-generation mobile network until after the general election, according to two people familiar with the plans.With a national vote due on Dec. 12, and the possibility of coalition negotiations before", "authors": ["Kitty Donaldson", "Thomas Seal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
