A wasp bumping into his head? Not such a big deal for Lakusta.\n\n\"But as a kid, that would scare me,\" he said. \"I thought, 'A kid doesn't need to be scared of stuff like this.'\"\n\nLakusta let the idea simmer in his head for a few months, thinking about the larger lesson in his observation. He realized the story isn't the wasp \u2014 it's the fear.\n\n\"I think what a kid can get out of it is to build some personal resilience and some control of themselves,\" he said.\n\n\"You can't control what's around you in your environment, but you can control if you are afraid of it.\"\n\nTom Lakusta and Corrine Smith are both proud of the book's message. (Emily Blake/CBC)\n\nSo Lakusta started storyboarding a children's book. It would be called A Bee Bumped into my Head. His next challenge would be finding somebody to bring his words to life.\n\n\"I'm not an artist, so I looked for an illustrator,\" he said.\n\nTwo illustrators he knew of weren't available, so he canvassed his son's girlfriend \u2014 who happens to be a kindergarten teacher \u2014 for ideas. She gave him some sage advice: \"Kids like what kids draw.\"\n\nSo Lakusta changed course. \"I auditioned a couple illustrators after making a storyboard of the book,\" he said. \"And Corinne became the illustrator.\"\n\nCorrine Smith is a Grade 7 student at Princess Alexandra school in Hay River. She said getting this opportunity is \"pretty cool\" because she never thought she'd be an illustrator. And, she admires the book's message.\n\n\"I think it has a good lesson that you don't have to be scared of everything, because everything is just living its own life,\" she said.\n\nSmith said she isn't sure if she'll illustrate more children's books in the future. She says maybe if she dabbles in publishing again, it'll be as an author.\n\n\"Maybe I'll do that one day, and illustrate my book too,\" she said.\n\nA Bee Bumped into my Head is available at libraries across the N.W.T., as well as the Hay River visitors centre, among a handful of other retailers. Lakusta said he's also sent the book to school boards across the territory.", "description": "Tom Lakusta, who works as a forester, says his book has a message: 'You can\u2019t control what\u2019s around you in your environment, but you can control if you are afraid of it.'", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5288818.1568838501!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/a-bee-bumped-into-my-head.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
