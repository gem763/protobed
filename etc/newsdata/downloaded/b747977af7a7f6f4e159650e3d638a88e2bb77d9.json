What was the first?\u201d\n\nTold soon thereafter it had been a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 win over Australian Nicole Pratt, Williams said: \u201cWhat? Wow, I do not remember that at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo?\u201d went a question.\n\n\u201cNo, not ring a bell at all.\u201d\n\nTold that it had been three sets, she said, \u201cIt was three sets here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing?\u201d went an ensuing question.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d went the answer.\n\nSlight pause: \u201cYou know, Venus will remember, though. She \u00adremembers everything.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 31, 1998, a 16-year-old Serena Williams improved her U.S. Open match record to 1-0, came into the interview room, mentioned having finished final exams in physics and Algebra II and said: \u201cOn the physics I got 82. I was very proud of that. I have no comment on the Algebra II.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental science, apparently, was up next.\n\nTwenty-one long and booming years later, that same person, a mother of one at 37, improved her U.S. Open match record to 100-12 with a romp past a perfectly capable opponent in Qiang Wang, blasted to within two wins of her record-tying 24th Grand Slam title and left a first-time opponent with a familiar first-time-against-Williams expression.\n\n\u201cPower,\u201d Wang said, and she seemed to gaze into some sort of eternity as she said it. Asked whether that meant Williams\u2019s power off the baseline or off the serve, Wang said, \u201cEverything.\u201d\n\nThe stat sheet of Williams\u2019s 6-1, 6-0 quarterfinal win looked like a case of power vs. power outage. It actually looked grim. Winners: 25-0. (Gasp.) Points: 50-15. (Mercy.) Points allowed in Williams\u2019s seven service games: 7. (Help.) Points in rallies of four shots or fewer: 36-10. (Sigh.) Unforced errors: 10 by Williams, which meant she allowed Wang to create only five points.\n\n\u201cThe power, I cannot handle it. Just too much for me,\u201d Wang said, self-assessing that she needed to \u201cbuild my muscle.\u201d\n\nShe sprinkled her remarks with slight laughs.\n\nIt was quite some confession for the top-ranked player in China and the No. 18 player in the world, one who spent the fourth round smashing No. 2 seed Ashleigh Barty, 6-2, 6-4, even if this did mark Wang\u2019s first Grand Slam quarterfinal and first appearance in Arthur Ashe Stadium, set against Williams\u2019s 52nd Grand Slam quarterfinal and the fact she could treat Ashe almost as an address.\n\nShe\u2019ll play its noisy theater again Thursday for her 38th Grand Slam semifinal, with only five other women left in the tournament. One is Ukraine\u2019s Elina Svitolina, No. 5 in the world to Williams\u2019s No. 8, and Williams\u2019s opponent for the semifinals. Head-to-head, those two started out with Williams winning four times, including at the 2015 Australian Open (4-6, 6-2, 6-0) and the 2016 French Open (6-1, 6-1), but then Svitolina beat Williams at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics (6-4, 6-3).\n\n\u201cWell, I think I have to run a lot, like all other matches,\u201d Svitolina said. \u201cThat\u2019s normal. And try to react. I played some big hitters in this tournament, a lot, and I have to just react quickly with my feet and with my shots, as well.\u201d\n\nIt will mark Svitolina\u2019s second Grand Slam final, following her breakthrough at Wimbledon, and it will bring another occasion centering on Williams, as on Tuesday night, when a new opponent lost herself in all the noise and lights and power.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t try to up any intimidation factor,\u201d the six-time U.S. Open champion said. \u201cI am who I am. I\u2019ve always been the person that goes out there and roars and screams and complains and cries and fights. I\u2019m extremely passionate about what I do. Most people that love their jobs are passionate about what they do. That\u2019s just me.\u201d\n\nShe said that 21 years after getting win No. 1 against Pratt and saying: \u201cI kept saying to myself, \u2018Serena, you can\u2019t be a first-round casualty.\u2019 It just would have been horrible.\u201d And: \u201cI like playing in big stadiums.\u201d And: \u201cLike I always saw on TV, the crowd goes wild, so it was pretty exciting to have it happen to me for the first time,\u201d she said before adding three words that made for one wildly accurate prediction: \u201cfirst of many.\u201d", "description": "Williams blasts Qiang Wang, 6-0, 6-1, in a one-sided quarterfinal.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports.", "September At Pm", "Chuck Culpepper Covers National College Sports", "As Well As Some Tennis", "Some Golf"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hvJPWNQsd_3QjdP0cCv6CKWtIQ4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5KN7C5GOXUI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg"}
