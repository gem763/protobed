O\u2019Brien started off by telling the host how he thought there could be something to President Trump\u2019s interest in purchasing Greenland.\n\n\u201cA lot of people like yourself were making jokes and I thought, why make jokes? Someone should go there. Someone responsible, someone revered, someone trusted should go to Greenland\u2026and see if we could make this [deal] happen,\u201d he said in jest.\n\nCooper interjected to recall an experience of his own in Greenland years ago where he had to use a \u201cshigloo\u201d bathroom.\n\n\u201cAre you OK, Anderson? Is it the beard? What\u2019s going on with you? Are you having a breakdown of some kind?\u201d Cooper joked. \u201cYou look like a very tidy wizard,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cit looks like you briefly dipped your chin into a sugar bowl.\u201d\n\nCooper told O'Brien it was the result of being on vacation for nine days and said he calls it the \"Blitzer beard challenge,\" referencing fellow CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer.\n\n\"Well he won,\" O'Brien shot back.\n\nVIDEO - @ConanOBrien Mocks Anderson Cooper\u2019s Facial Hair: What\u2019s Wrong with You?
