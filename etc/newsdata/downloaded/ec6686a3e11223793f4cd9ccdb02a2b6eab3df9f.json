Cummings\u2019 involvement, taking to the streets with a bullhorn, helped quiet the disturbances.\n\nBy day, Cummings was at the Capitol in the halls of power, McConnell said, but at night he returned Baltimore to encourage unity.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go home. Let\u2019s all go home,\u201d McConnell recalled Cummings saying at the time. \u201cNow our distinguished colleague truly has gone home.\u201d\n\nThe public was to have the chance to pay respects to Cummings later Thursday in Statuary Hall.\n\nCummings, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, died Oct. 17 after complications from long-standing health problems. A wake and funeral are planned Friday in Baltimore.\n\nA sharecropper\u2019s son, Cummings rose to become a civil rights champion and a leader of an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.\n\nAs a tribute to Cummings, no votes were scheduled Thursday in the House\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
