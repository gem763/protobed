Soon he\u2019ll tell us the best way to honour Martin Luther King is to get Brexit done, and the best way to honour anyone murdered by General Franco is to leave the EU without a deal as they were all big fans of Brexit.\n\nWhen Paula Sheriff MP said she had received \u201cdeath threats from people who quote Johnson\u2019s words\u201d, he replied he\u2019d \u201cnever heard so much humbug.\u201d He said it with such convincing authority, it seemed possible the reason he was so sure was that he had sent the threats, and he\u2019d only threatened to knock her about but never mentioned murder.\n\nI hope Paula Sheriff realises how much humbug she must have said, for it to have been more humbug than Johnson had ever heard. Because Johnson heard himself say he had allowed a grant of 100,000 pounds of public money to a friend\u2019s technology company that seemed barely to exist or meet the criteria for the grant.\n\nHe also insisted, when accused of staging a \u201cpress opportunity\u201d, \u201cThere\u2019s no press here\u201d in front of a crowd of press.\n\nAnd he said the reason for suspending parliament was nothing to do with Brexit, which 11 judges dismissed as obvious nonsense. And that\u2019s all in the last week. So you might think that even if Paula Sheriff said \u201cI hold the world record for playing a tuba underwater and I can talk to zebras\u201d, it wouldn\u2019t come near Johnson\u2019s own levels of humbug, but apparently she beat him, and should be very proud.\n\nHe\u2019s making this sort of thing normal now, and each week he tries to be even more dramatic. Already his response to the unanimous verdict outlawing his suspension of parliament, was to reveal he\u2019d do it again, like a young offender in a gritty film like Scum, telling his mates in borstal \u201cThe judge said I weren\u2019t allowed to prorogue, ha ha I don\u2019t give a s***, next time I\u2019ll do it for a year\u201d.\n\nSo while it\u2019s difficult to predict exactly what he\u2019ll do next, most likely he\u2019ll burst into the House of Commons with an AK47 and assassinate around 200 MPs. Then, after he\u2019s found guilty of murder, he\u2019ll announce he respects the court\u2019s decision but profoundly disagrees with it, and having restored his majority he\u2019ll sell the NHS to Trump, maybe in return for a pole dance.\n\nHe\u2019s so nakedly copying Trump, he\u2019ll tell his conference \u201cwe\u2019re going to put a wall of sharks in the English Channel, and who\u2019s going to pay for the sharks? FRANCE is going to pay for the sharks\u201d.\n\nAnd his supporters are now in such a fevered state, by the weekend, when Iain Duncan-Smith is asked about Johnson\u2019s dismissal of the death threats, he\u2019ll just emit a deep purring noise, then sing \"respect the will of the people\" and sit on Emily Maitlis with dribble running down his chin until he\u2019s shot with a tranquiliser dart and sent to bed for three days.\n\nBernard Jenkin on Newsnight explained his leader\u2019s words by saying \u201cThink of the strain the prime minister is under\u201d, and we should remember that. He\u2019s had this job thrust upon him even though he never showed any ambition that he wanted to do it. And we should all remember that any of us, when we\u2019re under pressure, react by insulting the memory of a woman who was murdered.\n\nSo often, when we\u2019re frustrated because we get a parking ticket or the trains are cancelled, we snap and shout \u201cDon\u2019t whine to me about Joan of Arc\u201d, it\u2019s a natural reaction.\n\nEven so, some people suggest the language in parliament should be toned down, for example we shouldn\u2019t use the word \u201cbetrayal\u201d about the 17.4 million people who voted to Leave the EU.\n\nBut maybe it is an appropriate word. Because they voted Leave having been told a deal would be the easiest one ever to arrange, and bring \u00a3350m a week to the NHS, with no mention of medicine running out or historic levels of joyful boundless chaos. So for politicians to assume all this, including dismissing death threats, and insulting the names of the murdered, is being done in their name, could be said to be a complete betrayal of those 17.4 million.", "description": "At last we have a prime minister prepared to say what all reasonable people think, that the best way to honour Jo Cox is to get Brexit done, rather than get bogged down in liberal concerns that her campaigning against it is what led to her murder.", "authors": ["Mark Steel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/19/08/boris-johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
