He effusively pointed to the progress of their performance and how it offered encouragement for the future.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t entirely wilful optimism either, for which the manager has been previously criticised. It was a display where you can at least understand why many at United do genuinely believe that this situation \u2013 and this managerial reign \u2013 will work out once a few different elements come together. And once Solskjaer gets some of the players he want.\n\nFirst of all, from the very start, the Norwegian got his tactics right. It was probably his most impressive piece of managerial impact since the Champions League victory over Paris Saint-Germain in March. Some coaches in the game subscribe to a theory that there is always a formation that perfectly fits and maximises any squad. The challenge is finding it, figuring out the measurements, which takes a lot of insight and intuition. Antonio Conte used to describe it as \u201ctailoring a suit to fit them\u201d and perhaps the most famous recent example is his innovation with Chelsea in 2016-17.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Conte won a league with that approach. Solskjaer is still trying to get his team to win games, something they failed to do against Liverpool, as they similarly failed to score more than one goal in a match for the 21st time out of 24 this season.\n\nIt means United have now had their worst start to a season since 1986-87, when Ron Atkinson was sacked.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It also fitted playing Liverpool, given that United dealt better with Jurgen Klopp\u2019s full-backs than pretty much any other side since they were brought into the team.\n\nIn that regard, Solskjaer got it spot on.\n\nHe also acknowledged that it can be much more than a bespoke approach for the European champions.\n\n\u201cIt can develop into something, because we\u2019ve got players to play three at the back, and allows more width in the team. Of course it\u2019s a risk against their front three, but it\u2019s a risk you have to take. We did it to create chances ourselves.\u201d\n\nSome might scoff at that given United really only created two big chances at home, but that \u2013 and the performance \u2013 have to be put into the context of this match. Liverpool went into the game with everything going right. United went into the game with everything going wrong. Despite that, Solskjaer\u2019s side controlled the shape and pattern of the game for just about the majority of it, before tailing off.\n\nSome of their attacking moves in this time, not least for the goal through the incisive Dan James, were also promising.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re better when we attack quickly,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cNo dilly-dallying. It doesn\u2019t have to be a counter-attack. I spoke about it before the game, to take more risks, be braver\u2026 it\u2019s the right type of football.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s pretty much Solskjaer\u2019s idealised football, albeit without an ideal team \u2013 which is what\u2019s really relevant.\n\nUnited\u2019s first XI is currently stretched to the limit, with that especially clear in midfield, so it left almost nothing on their bench. It meant Solskjaer didn\u2019t really have the ability to freshen things up, or change things, in the way Klopp did to rescue the point.\n\nIt\u2019s similarly little wonder that \u2013 to go with the wider issues regarding injury absences and adjustment to pre-season \u2013 the team ran out of energy again. That has been something of a theme, especially as Adam Lallana\u2019s goal meant they have now dropped eight points from winning positions this season.\n\nThis is why the players were particularly disappointed. They felt they should have held out. They physically couldn\u2019t, as an element of connected mental fatigue saw the defence momentarily lose concentration for that fatal error.\n\nBut this is also why there are reasons for some encouragement. Solskjaer feels the team will be able to properly play this approach once he has everyone properly back, and another player or two in.\n\nHe similarly feels he has a foundation. That\u2019s hard to dispute given he also has a defence that \u2013 by Opta\u2019s xG measures \u2013 has the best defence in the Premier League as regards preventing the opposition creating quality chances.\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka personified much of this. He is crucial to the new sturdiness in defence, key to Solskjaer\u2019s tactics in how he also pinned back Andy Robertson, and put in some fine crosses in the attacking third.\n\nThis was what Solskjaer was emphasising in that dressing room. It is why many at United believe things will soon tangibly improve on the scoreboard.", "description": "In the dressing room after their 1-1 draw with Liverpool, the Manchester United players were down, so Ole Gunnar Solskjaer felt he had to rev them up.
