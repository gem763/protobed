They've been filled in.\"\n\n\"I don't agree,\" Isobel says.\n\n(Image: MTV)\n\nJordan argues: \"It's not gonna be Megan, you underrate yourself.\"\n\nThe audience votes that Megan was better looking out of the two girls.\n\nThe former couple got together after meeting on MTV show Ex On The Beach, and returned to a later series, where he popped the question.\n\nShe later said she was angry that Jordan had proposed on camera, telling the Daily Mail : \"I wish he didn't do it, I think it's embarrassing. He embarrassed me.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"He lied to me about the ring price for a start... He makes me out to be bad all the time but he needs to realise he's a liar.\n\n\"I actually blocked Jordan on everything when we broke up because he wasn't a very good boy.\n\n\"I think he's been a little s**tbag really and he tries to get back to me with other people and it doesn't work. Let him get on with it because I'm happy.\"\n\nYour Face Or Mine continues tonight at 8pm on Comedy Central UK", "description": "Jordan Davies said his new girlfriend Isobel Mills is better looking than Megan because she doesn't have fake lips", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Comedy Central", "Instagram Megan_Mckenna", "Mtv", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article7150541.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Megan-McKenna-and-Jordan-Davies.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
