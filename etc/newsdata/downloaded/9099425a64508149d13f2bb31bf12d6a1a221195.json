But today, any hopes that Netflix would show up on the Mac as a native app were crushed, with Bloomberg reporting that the streaming service won\u2019t be launching a Catalyst app for macOS.\n\nNetflix is one of the most popular free iPad apps on the entire platform. And while it\u2019s true that it\u2019s already available on Mac computers through any web browser, there are advantages to a native app that a ported iPad version could bring, including downloadable movies and TV shows to enjoy offline or full integration for Apple\u2019s picture-in-picture mode.\n\nThere\u2019s a precedent, too: Netflix makes a native Windows 10 app for its streaming service on PCs that, while likely intended for tablets, works great on desktop and laptop devices.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest blow for Apple\u2019s Catalyst app initiative, which appears to be off to a slow start, despite the fact that Catalina is now publicly available. As Bloomberg points out, at Catalina\u2019s launch on October 7th, there were roughly 20 ported iPad apps available on the Mac App Store. That\u2019s not exactly the revolution Apple likely hoped for. DC Universe and Asphalt 9, two of the biggest Catalyst apps that Apple showcased, missed the launch and have been removed from Apple\u2019s Catalina website.", "description": "Netflix has confirmed that the streaming service won\u2019t be launching a Catalyst iPad app port for macOS, crushing the hopes of a more full-featured version of the service making its way to computers.", "authors": ["Chaim Gartenberg", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-WQARWmr8RjWlhToKczjJJG009o=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3446756/netflix-stock-1110.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
