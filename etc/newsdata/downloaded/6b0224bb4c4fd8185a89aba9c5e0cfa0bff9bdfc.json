Penn State (2-0) won last year\u2019s game at Heinz Field 51-6 in the rain and has outscored the Panthers 84-20 the last two years. Sean Clifford leads a Penn State offense averaging 515 yards per game. Pitt\u2019s defense should provide Clifford his toughest test before Big Ten play begins. Pitt QB Kenny Pickett was ineffective in last year\u2019s game, but he\u2019s coming off a career game against Ohio. The Panthers (1-1) are looking for their first win in Happy Valley since 1988.\n\nBEST MATCHUP\n\nNo. 19 Iowa at Iowa State\n\nIowa (2-0) has won four straight in the Cy-Hawk Series and outscored its first two opponents by a combined 68-14. Hawkeyes QB Nate Stanley has been sharp so far, having thrown six touchdown passes and no interceptions. In his only previous game in Ames, he threw for a career-high 333 yards and five TDs. The Cyclones (1-0) are coming off an open date following their triple-overtime win over FCS Northern Iowa. The atmosphere will be charged with ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d making its first visit to Ames.\n\nFACTS AND FIGURES\n\nNo. 21 Maryland (at Temple) has scored 142 points, tied with 1996 Ohio State for most by a Big Ten team through two games and tied for third-most by an FBS team since 1936, trailing only Mississippi\u2019s 149 in 2015 and Florida\u2019s 143 in 1994. \u2026 Minnesota (vs. Georgia Southern) is 10-0 against teams from the Sun Belt Conference. \u2026 Northwestern QB Hunter Johnson, who struggled against Stanford, has a chance to build some confidence against a UNLV pass defense ranked 109th nationally. \u2026 Mark Dantonio (109-51) will overtake Duffy Daughtery (109-65-5 from 1954-72) as No. 18 Michigan State\u2019s all-time wins leader if the Spartans beat Arizona State at home. \u2026 Illinois (vs. Eastern Michigan) allowed just 10 rushing yards at UConn, the fourth-fewest against the Illini since 2000. \u2026 Indiana (vs. No. 6 Ohio State) is coming off a 52-0 win over Eastern Illinois, the Hoosiers\u2019 largest margin of victory at home since 1944. \u2026 Ohio State has won 23 in a row against Indiana since a 27-27 tie in 1990 and hasn\u2019t lost to the Hoosiers since 1988.\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nNorthern Illinois, 14-point underdog at Nebraska\n\nThe Huskies went into Lincoln and beat the Mike Riley-coached Cornhuskers two years ago, and second-year coach Scott Frost\u2019s team looks vulnerable after winning a closer-than-expected opener against South Alabama and losing in overtime at Colorado after blowing a 17-point lead. Northern Illinois has beaten eight opponents from a Power Five conference or major independent since 2009. The Huskies played No. 11 Utah tough into the second half last week.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH\n\nWhoever plays quarterback for Purdue\n\nNational passing leader Elijah Sindelar started the week in the concussion protocol but hasn\u2019t been ruled out of Purdue\u2019s much anticipated home game against TCU. If Sindelar can\u2019t play, redshirt freshman Jack Plummer would make his first start. TCU\u2019s secondary, which led the Big 12 the last two years, lost starting CB Julius Lewis to a knee injury a few days before the Horned Frogs\u2019 opener. Sindelar has thrown for 932 yards and nine touchdowns in two games. Plummer has never taken a snap as a collegian.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/APTop25CollegeFootballPoll and https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Here's what to watch in the Big Ten this week:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eric Olson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/buffalo_penn_st_football_58562_c0-155-3720-2323_s1770x1032.jpg?cd84b3585fc3f559314377da26fdbbe8d5f89338", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
