The count accuses the parents of attempting to bribe officials at an organization that receives at least $10,000 in federal funding.\n\nThey are accused of paying to get their children admitted to the University of Southern California. All 11 defendants have previously pleaded not guilty to other charges in the scheme.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time prosecutors have added new charges for parents pleading not guilty in the case. In April, they added money laundering to the initial charges of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nU.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling in Boston said the latest charges stem from an ongoing investigation. The charges will further his goal of holding the defendants \u201cfully accountable for corrupting the college admissions process through cheating, bribery and fraud,\u201d he said in a written statement.\n\nLawyers for Loughlin and Giannulli did not immediately respond to the charges. The couple are accused of paying $500,000 to get their two daughters admitted to USC as recruits on the crew team, even though neither participated in the sport. Loughlin and Giannulli have pleaded not guilty.\n\nOthers indicted on the new charge include William McGlashan, who co-founded an investment fund with U2\u2019s Bono in 2017, and Robert Zangrillo, a prominent Miami real estate developer.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Full House\" actress Lori Loughlin, her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, and nine other parents were indicted Tuesday on new federal charges as prosecutors pressure them to admit guilt in a college admissions bribery scheme.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Collin Binkley"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/college_admissions_bribery_44440_c0-0-4880-2846_s1200x700.jpg?03d99fc6c032e90c6c812beab8baab481a957ade", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
