I\u2019m just worried about one day at a time, and whatever happens down the road, it\u2019s not on my mind.\u201d\n\nIt may not have crossed his mind, or that of many of the 43,910 in attendance for Game 5. But the fact is, Rendon\u2019s ninth-inning line-out to right, in the final game at Nationals Park in 2019, could have been \u2014 maybe \u2014 the last time the home fans would see Rendon in a Nationals uniform. Free agency awaits him at the conclusion of this World Series, and both its timetable and trajectory, and the question of whether it ends with him back in Washington in 2020, are unknown.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis, in fact, is the week of awkward maybe-goodbyes \u2014 maybe it\u2019s goodbye, maybe it\u2019s not \u2014 in the World Series, given its unusual confluence of top-shelf, high-profile free agents and the dwindling number of games remaining.\n\nSunday night also marked a possible end for Gerrit Cole\u2019s tenure in Houston. If it was goodbye \u2014 maybe \u2014 the ace right-hander turned his final start for the Astros into a gem, delivering seven dominant innings to send the series back to Houston with the Astros holding a 3-2 lead. In the road venue, Cole\u2019s farewell \u2014 maybe \u2014 was even less ceremonious than Rendon\u2019s. He simply walked off the mound after one last strikeout to end the seventh, and into a line of handshakes in his dugout.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his last start for sure \u2014 for this season,\u201d Houston Manager A.J. Hinch told Astros beat writers when asked whether he had considered the possibility it might be Cole\u2019s final start for the franchise. \u201cThe reflection on stuff like that has to come at a later date, when and if things change. We haven\u2019t had an emotional conversation about the possibility.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis World Series is different in that it features the three most highly regarded free agents of the coming market, in Rendon, Cole and Nationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg \u2014 who is widely expected to exercise an opt-out clause in his contract after the World Series that would make him a free agent.\n\nIt is a good time to be the three of them \u2014 with a combined payday of half a billion dollars or more coming their way in a matter of months \u2014 and it is also good to be agent Scott Boras, who represents all three.\n\nStrasburg\u2019s start in Game 6 on Tuesday night in Houston could be \u2014 maybe \u2014 his own goodbye to the Nationals. He has 72 hours from the final pitch of the 2019 World Series to decide whether he is going to opt out of the final four years and $100 million of the $175 million contract he signed in 2016.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBased on agent Boras\u2019s M.O., he is likely to do so \u2014 although Strasburg has already bucked Boras\u2019s tendencies once by signing his 2016 deal without testing free agency \u2014 and even if he does opt out, the Nationals could still work out a new deal with him, perhaps by tacking extra years onto the end of the current deal. A similar situation a year ago with Los Angeles Dodgers lefty Clayton Kershaw resulted in him signing a three-year, $93 million extension with the team.\n\nStrasburg\u2019s comfort level with the Nationals, and the fact he recently moved his family to the area from southern California, has the team feeling confident about its chances of keeping him in the fold.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Boras might have attended one or more World Series games and held court with the media to tout his pending free agents on the competing rosters. But with such high-profile clients on both rosters \u2014 competing with each other on the field and, in the case of Cole and Strasburg, potentially on the marketplace as well \u2014 he has stayed away from the series and kept a low media profile.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoras, who typically represents a handful of the top players in any free agent market, this year has the market for high-end talent more or less cornered. In addition to Cole, Rendon and Strasburg, he also represents lefties Hyun-Jin Ryu and Dallas Keuchel and hired bats Nick Castellanos and Mike Moustakas, as well as designated hitter J.D. Martinez, who is likely to opt out of his deal and go to free agency.\n\nWith Boras known to wait as long as he needs to get his clients their money, Major League Baseball officials are already anticipating another long, slow-moving free agent market that, like last winter\u2019s, could drag well into the spring.\n\nOnce all the pieces fall into place, Cole, 29, is the favorite to wind up with the largest deal of the three, one that is expected to shatter David Price\u2019s seven-year, $217 million deal with Boston as the largest ever given to a pitcher.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf Cole winds up leading the Astros to a World Series title \u2014 and he is 4-1 with a 1.72 ERA and 47 strikeouts in 36 \u2154 innings this postseason \u2014 could they really allow him to walk away? Billionaire owner Jim Crane has the wherewithal to keep him, despite owing $68 million to Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke the next two seasons, particularly given the lucrative revenue streams from this month\u2019s championship push. But the question is whether Crane would be willing to blow past the 2020 luxury-tax threshold of $208 million to make a big play to keep him.\n\nThe competition for Cole would be considerable, beginning with the New York Yankees \u2014 a team Cole vanquished in the ALCS, and one that is already 0 for 2 in trying to acquire him. Cole famously spurned the Yankees as a high schooler after the 2008 draft, choosing to go to UCLA instead; and in January 2018, the Pittsburgh Pirates, who were shopping Cole, chose the Astros\u2019 package over the Yankees\u2019, sending their ace to Houston in exchange for four prospects.\n\nBut many of Cole\u2019s teammates expect he will wind up somewhere closer to his southern California roots, with the Los Angeles Angels seemingly making the most sense.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRendon, too, is likely to be pursued by a sizable pack of some of the most deep-pocketed and motivated teams in the game, with the Dodgers heading the first category and the Texas Rangers, who are moving into a new stadium in 2020, the second. The Nationals have already offered Rendon a seven-year deal in the range of $210 million to $215 million, but Boras is thought to be targeting Nolan Arenado\u2019s eight-year, $260 million deal as a comparable.\n\nIf Sunday night was goodbye for Rendon \u2014 maybe \u2014 the moment deserved better for both player and fans. Those who were left in the stands offered little evidence they recognized its import.\n\nRendon\u2019s liner off Astros reliever Ryan Pressley traveled so quickly, and Rendon himself reacted so slowly out of the box, that he was barely halfway down the first base line when it was caught, ending an 0-for-3 night. He peeled off toward the Nationals dugout, and a handful of fans there stood and clapped. Rendon appeared to look in that direction, but quickly removed his helmet and disappeared into the dugout.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThere might\u2019ve been [some applause], but I kind of block it out.\u201d\n\nWhen Rendon returns to Nationals Park at some point in the future, he will be a couple hundred-million dollars richer. And he very well could be in another team\u2019s uniform.\n\nSunday night was Rendon\u2019s maybe-goodbye to Washington. But who knows? With a pair of wins in Houston this week, there might still be a chance for a more proper farewell, at a World Series parade down Constitution Avenue.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "This World Series is different in that it features the three most highly regarded free agents of the coming market, in Anthony Rendon, Gerrit Cole and Stephen Strasburg.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6i2UaIuMPQEhYIM99TTbyDRrxbw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NNWPVJHZGUI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
