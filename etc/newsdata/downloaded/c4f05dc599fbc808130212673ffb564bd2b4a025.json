The ban begins immediately, even with several members of the Oregon Project still competing in the 2019 IAAF World Championships in Doha, Qatar. After the announcement, Salazar\u2019s accreditation for the meet was revoked.\n\n\n\nTwo independent three-member arbitration panels found that Salazar and Brown \u201ctrafficked testosterone, a banned performance-enhancing substance, administered a prohibited IV infusion, and engaged in tampering to attempt to prevent relevant information about their conduct from being learned by USADA.\u201d\n\nThe investigation into the Nike Oregon Project, Salazar, and Brown began in 2015. The USADA announcement noted that the investigation included 30 witnesses, 5,780 pages of transcripts, and 2,000 exhibits of evidence. The BBC reported that USADA brought doping charges against Salazar and Brown in March 2017, and the two contested the charges, which then went to arbitration.\n\nSalazar adamantly denied all accusations throughout the process. In a statement on the Oregon Project website posted on Monday evening, he wrote, in part: \u201cI am shocked by the outcome today. Throughout this six-year investigation my athletes and I have endured unjust, unethical and highly damaging treatment from USADA...I have always ensured the WADA code is strictly followed. The Oregon Project has never and will never permit doping.\u201d He wrote that he will appeal the decision.\n\n\u201cThe athletes in these cases found the courage to speak out and ultimately exposed the truth,\u201d said USADA Chief Executive Officer Travis Tygart in a release. \u201cWhile acting in connection with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr. Salazar and Dr. Brown demonstrated that winning was more important than the health and wellbeing of the athletes they were sworn to protect.\u201d\n\n\n\nSalazar\u2019s athletes have won dozens of Olympic and world championships medals over the years, as well as international marathons. Notable names in running have left Salazar and the Oregon Project in the past few years, including Mo Farah, who won four Olympic golds and six world titles, Matthew Centrowitz, who won the 2016 Olympic gold medal in the 1500 meters, Mary Cain, who at age 17 was a 2013 world championships finalist, and Dathan Ritzenhein, a three-time Olympian who left the team in 2014.\n\nWatch: Elite runners react to the news of Salazar's ban.\n\n\n\nNot every member of the Nike Oregon Project is directly coached by Salazar, but several members of the team are still competing at this week\u2019s world championships. Sifan Hassan, a Dutch distance runner and member of the Oregon Project, won the world outdoor title in the women\u2019s 10,000 meters on Saturday.\n\nTwo of his current athletes\u2014Galen Rupp and Jordan Hasay\u2014are scheduled to run the Chicago Marathon on October 13. No Nike Oregon Project athletes have tested positive for a banned substance.\n\nRunner\u2019s World attempted to contact Hasay and the Chicago Marathon, but requests for comment were not immediately returned.\n\nOn Monday evening, Nike released the following statement:\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision had nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete. As the panel noted, they were struck by the amount of care Alberto took to ensure he was complying with the World Anti-Doping Code.\n\n\u201cWe support Alberto in his decision to appeal and wish him the full measure of due process that the rules require. Nike does not condone the use of banned substances in any manner.\u201d\n\n\u2014This story will be updated.", "description": "After a four-year investigation, the coach was found to be \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping.\u201d", "authors": ["The Runner'S World Editors"], "top_image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/nike-oregon-project-coach-alberto-salazar-watches-the-mens-news-photo-1569892145.jpg?crop=1xw:0.75011xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
