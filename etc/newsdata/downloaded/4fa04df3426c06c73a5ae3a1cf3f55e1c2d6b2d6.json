You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNow, the prime minister must navigate a parliamentary minefield as he seeks to win approval for the withdrawal agreement bill, which enshrines his deal in law.\n\nThe passage of the bill, which is required to deliver Brexit, provides MPs with the opportunity to try to bind the government to a range of outcomes.\n\nAmendments will be tabled to the draft law to try to trigger a second referendum or cancel Brexit entirely.\n\nThese are unlikely to pass. The motion with the best prospects of being approved is one that would force the government to try to negotiate a customs union with the EU after Brexit.\n\nThis would not seek to change the terms of the deal by which the UK will leave the EU \u2013 the issue of the future relationship is a matter for talks in the coming months and years, not for the withdrawal agreement.\n\nNor would it need to alter the accompanying political declaration that lays out a draft framework for the future EU-UK relationship, because the document is not legally binding and would not prevent a customs union being agreed at a later date.\n\nInstead, the amendment would bind the government\u2019s hands during talks with the EU about a future trade agreement.\n\nJohnson will fight that tooth and nail. His government, like that of Theresa May\u2019s before it, has repeatedly insisted that staying in a customs union with the EU would not truly deliver Brexit, and the prime minister knows that his Eurosceptic MPs would never allow it.\n\nBut if the amendment is passed, he will be stuck. The prime minister would then either have to accept the demand or scrap the entire bill in order to negate the amendment. That makes it impossible for him to implement his Brexit deal, because the bill is needed to enshrine the withdrawal agreement in law.\n\nIf the bill is withdrawn, Johnson would be expected to try to trigger an immediate general election to seek to secure a Commons majority that would allow him to get MPs\u2019 approval for his plan.\n\nWill a motion for a customs union pass the Commons? That is the question on everyone\u2019s lips in Westminster. On Monday morning it looked highly possible, after DUP sources hinted that they could team up with Labour and others to force it through. The Northern Irish party is staunchly opposed to Johnson\u2019s deal because it would create a new customs and regulatory border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

MPs later played down suggestions that they could vote for such an amendment, which is likely to be put to a vote on Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nThat means the vote is on a knife-edge. Almost all Labour MPs are likely to back it, along with those from the other opposition parties. The key factor will be whether the Tory MPs who voted for a customs union during a series of \u201cindicative votes\u201d earlier in the year can be persuaded to do so again.\n\nThe early indications are that some will not. Two of this group \u2013 Damian Green and Paul Masterton \u2013 have already said as much. They argued that this is not a debate that needs to be had now, and claimed that it risked having the consequences of simply delaying Brexit. A further two \u2013 Robert Buckland and Nicky Morgan \u2013 are now in the cabinet and will be bound by collective responsibility.\n\nThe best chance of a customs union amendment succeeding may be if it is introduced in the House of Lords, but it would then face being dismissed in the Commons.\n\nWith his majority on the issue unclear, this is the next big obstacle facing the prime minister. Most commentators think he will overcome it and get the withdrawal agreement bill through parliament with only minor amendments. However, no one would be foolish enough to say so with any great certainty. Recent months have shown the folly of making any such predictions.", "description": "It was a case of so near and yet so far for Boris Johnson, who on Saturday came within 16\u00a0votes of defeating an attempt to delay a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on his Brexit\u00a0deal.
