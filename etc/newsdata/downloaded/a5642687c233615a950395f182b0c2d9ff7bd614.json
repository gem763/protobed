I asked it when Beto O\u2019Rourke began to tease the idea of running for president as a former backbench congressman whose main selling point was that he almost didn\u2019t lose his bid for a Senate seat in Texas. I asked it when he chose to publish meandering journal entries about his feelings and the weather as he road-tripped across America, attempting to give literary weight to his eventual decision to enter the race. I asked it when he live-streamed a dentist cleaning his teeth. And I asked it as he revealed early on that he lacked a coherent policy vision or unique proposition\u2014other than his recent social media stardom\u2014that would justify entering a race teeming with talented candidates.\n\nBut lately I\u2019ve tweaked the formulation of my question\u2014now it goes: \u201cWhat the hell is Beto doing?\u201d O'Rourke has veered from mere self-indulgence to recklessness. In his desperation to repeat the viral glory that followed his spontaneous soliloquy defending NFL players kneeling during the national anthem in his Senate race, he\u2019s become increasingly inclined to shoot from the hip. In the past month, he\u2019s made shocking pledges to enthusiastically seize people\u2019s assault-style rifles and strip churches of tax-exempt status for opposing same-sex marriage. These provocative remarks haven\u2019t helped him in the polls or improved his standing on the left, but they have made him a conservative boogeyman and provided nightmare fodder for right-wing ad campaigns designed to fuel turnout.\n\nIn light of this, there is a case to be made that O'Rourke is running the worst 2020 campaign of any candidate in the race. Lacking a clear sense of purpose, he\u2019s scrambling to find a way to stand out from the pack by creating new wars, which members of the Democratic Party\u2014moderates and left-wingers alike\u2014are not trying to wage in this political moment. Just as importantly, these inflammatory moves are obliterating his chances at a real shot at pivoting to a 2020 Senate race against John Cornyn, a powerful but vulnerable Republican, in Texas. Given how hard it will be for the Democrats to retake a majority in the Senate in the next election\u2014an essential condition for passing any Democratic president\u2019s legislative agenda\u2014that\u2019s no small sin.\n\nHad O'Rourke mounted a thoughtful campaign to shift the Overton window (the spectrum of acceptable ideas in public discourse) on issues like gun control from day one, and presented his ideas with care, his recent antics could\u2019ve made some sense. But that\u2019s not the case. As with virtually everything else in his campaign, the engine is what his gut feels is right on any given day, and the fuel is a thirst for social media approbation.\n\nMany of the themes of O'Rourke\u2019s political style can be traced back to his life before politics. After completing prep school and earning an undergraduate degree at Columbia University, he spent his twenties traveling, partying, and drifting. He tried his hand at many kinds of work: musician, nanny, magazine founder, web designer, art mover, an employee at his mother\u2019s furniture store. He also got in a bit of trouble: he was arrested twice, once for \u201cattempted forcible entry\u201d at the University of Texas in El Paso, and once for drunk driving (he hit a truck, and a witness told the police that he attempted to flee the scene). The picture that emerges from O'Rourke\u2019s twenties is one of a Kerouacian desire for self-discovery and a yearning for reinvention. It also illustrates a privileged existence free of consequences for indecision or bad decisions, buoyed by his parents\u2019 wealth and his elite education.\n\nO'Rourke did not achieve a clear sense of self as he entered politics. As a member of the El Paso City Council, he crusaded for a downtown development plan that was conceived of by his father-in-law Bill Sanders\u2014a real estate mogul worth half a billion dollars. Among other things, critics accused O'Rourke of siding with the city\u2019s business class and his family members over the immigrants he allies himself with so often in rhetoric. Later he won a seat in Congress by painting his incumbent opponent Silvestre Reyes as a corrupt Washington insider, but with the crucial aid of a super PAC underwritten by his father-in-law.\n\nO'Rourke\u2019s ideological profile didn\u2019t really come into focus on the Hill either. As a member of the House, he voted very conservatively for a Democrat. He voted against his own party 167 times on legislation and sided with the GOP on bills that undermined Obamacare, Wall Street regulations, and consumer protections. That\u2019s noteworthy for two reasons: First, he represented a deeply blue district, meaning that he was voting to the right of his constituents on many issues. Second, when he made a bid for Ted Cruz\u2019s seat in the Senate he actually pivoted to the left with his rhetoric on issues like climate and immigration.\n\nThe presidential campaign has given O'Rourke yet another opportunity to forge a new identity. When asked by a reporter if he was a progressive Democrat, he had a remarkable reply. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he told Politico in March. \u201cI\u2019m just, as you may have seen and heard over the course of the campaign, I\u2019m not big on labels. I don\u2019t get all fired up about party or classifying or defining people based on a label or a group. I\u2019m for everyone.\u201d\n\nHow can a politician be for everyone? Well, they can\u2019t; millions of Americans have unbridgeable, different views on everything from abortion rights to fair taxation, and the poor and the rich have different interests. But it was simultaneously a sincere admission that he doesn\u2019t have a clear worldview, and a clumsy attempt to depict himself as a Democrat capable of winning votes from people outside the Democratic base.\n\nO'Rourke\u2019s argument for why he\u2019d be a unity candidate has come in the form of a super-charged authenticity politics designed to capitalize on his charisma: pensive diary entries and intimate videos on social media; speaking to crowds while standing on diner counters with his sleeves rolled up; a lot of talk about honesty and setting aside differences.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work. O\u2019Rourke wasn\u2019t able to recapture the astonishing momentum of his Senate race, even with early praise from Barack Obama and his aides, and a strong initial round of fundraising. But after a gunman killed 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso in August, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s commitment to speaking his mind only deepened. He started to use the word \u201cfuck\u201d a lot and turned further inward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been focused on saying what\u2019s on my mind, being myself,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told the New York Times in the wake of the El Paso shooting. \u201cAnd not really in the slightest being interested in polls, or how things poll, or what you\u2019re supposed to say.\u201d\n\nThat mindset manifested itself at a debate in September, when O\u2019Rourke argued for a mandatory buyback of assault-style rifles by crying out, \"Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d It was a breakout moment, but not in a productive way. The NRA called O\u2019Rourke the \u201cAR-15 salesman of the month,\u201d gun stores used the comment as a marketing tool, both Democratic and Republican lawmakers sponsoring bipartisan gun control legislation worried it jeopardized their agenda, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was compelled to say, \"I don't know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O'Rourke.\u201d\n\nIn reality, other 2020 Democrats have supported the idea of a mandatory buyback to varying degrees, including Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, but they\u2019ve taken pains to avoid stoking conservative paranoia about the government coming door-to-door to seize people\u2019s guns. There is also the question of whether O\u2019Rourke is tapping into an issue that\u2019s appropriate for an \u201cI\u2019m for everyone\u201d politician. The polling on support for a mandatory buyback in America is decidedly mixed. While some polls show a narrow majority favor the idea, many others find support well below 50 percent. Data for Progress shared polling data from mid-September with VICE which found a mandatory buyback \u201cvery unpopular.\u201d Support for such a program stood at around 37 percent, while 54 percent of respondents opposed it. Crucially, those who opposed it felt much more strongly than those who supported it.\n\nDuring an LGBTQ town hall in October, O\u2019Rourke whipped up more controversy when he argued that religious institutions that oppose same-sex marriage ought to lose their tax-exempt status. \u201cThere can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone \u2026 that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us,\u201d he said. This is an idea that no other 2020 Democrats support since it would violate the First Amendment by allowing the state to create an ideological litmus test for tax breaks. It earned condemnation on the left as \u201cperhaps the worst idea of the Democratic primary,\u201d and conservatives homed in on it as a rallying cry to warn against the imminent tyranny of a Democratic presidency. O\u2019Rourke partially walked it back later, but the right-wing talking points were already out. Had he prioritized serious ideas on advancing LGBTQ rights over a cheap trick for trending on Twitter, the whole mess would never have occurred.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s quest for his next favorite \u201ctranscendent moment,\u201d like someone looking for a fix, has gone from solipsistic to actively harmful. His recent gadfly behavior isn\u2019t expanding into the social democratic space that lawmakers like Sen. Bernie Sanders have found that there\u2019s a real appetite for\u2014it\u2019s just causing problems. And another run for Senate in religious, gun-loving Texas is likely a lost cause at this point. There never was an obvious reason for O\u2019Rourke to enter the race. Now it seems like there\u2019s no obvious reason to stay in.\n\nZeeshan Aleem is a columnist for VICE.
