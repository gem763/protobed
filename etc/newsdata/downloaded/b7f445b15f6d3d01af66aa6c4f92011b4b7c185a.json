We're observing how these animals are manipulating their prey and preparing the prey for capture,' said Professor Bejder.\n\n'So it is allowing us to gain new insights that [we] really haven't been able to do before.'\n\nThe footage was captured as part of a project that is investigating why humpback whale numbers seem to be on the decline.\n\nResearchers are particularly focused on the impacts of both shifts in habitat use and changes in food availability linked to climate change and diminished prey numbers.\n\nAround 3,000 humpback whales visit Alaska every summer during their feeding period, while up to 10,000 migrate to Hawaii in the winters to breed.\n\nThe whales captured in this footage are preparing themselves for the 3,000 mile (around 4,800 kilometre) -long haul down towards the warmer winter waters around Hawaii by feasting on fish.\n\nThey will not eat until they return to Alaska's waters several months later.\n\nThe findings of the researchers' study will help to shine light not only on how the whales feed, but also how often, what they feed on and the impact such feeding frenzies have on the development of their bodies.\n\nResearchers captured the unprecedentedly detailed footage of the unusual surface feeding practice \u2014 dubbed bubble-net fishing \u2014 in waters off of Southeast Alaska\n\nMarine biologist Lars Bejder of the University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa and colleagues used drones to capture a bird's-eye view of the whales feeding, along with data collected from the whale's point-of-view, pictured, by cameras stuck to the mammals' bodies with suction cups\n\n'We have two angles, and the drone\u2019s perspective is showing us these bubble nets and how the bubbles are starting to come to the surface and how the animals come up through the bubble net as they surface,' said Professor Bejder.\n\n'The cameras on the whales are telling us this from the animal\u2019s perspective, so overlaying these two data sets is quite exciting.'\n\n'In Hawai'i it's a breeding and resting ground. When they get to Alaska it\u2019s a foraging ground.'\n\n'We\u2019re trying to understand what that whole migration costs these animals and also how much prey these animals have to consume to maintain this whole migration.'\n\n'The footage is rather groundbreaking.
