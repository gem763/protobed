To join a mob is simultaneously an act of self-abasement and self-aggrandizement.\u201d\n\nAnd of course the culture and technology of contemporary interaction act as powerful accelerants to the already-raging fire of mob rule. Williamson cites studies of online behavior showing decisively that \u201cboth interactions with like-minded people and interactions with people holding other viewpoints tend to reinforce the preexisting views of those in the conversation and to exaggerate them. For that reason, the structure of social media makes outraged polarization practically inevitable.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Michael Rosen", "Thebulwark.Com How-The-Right-Learned-To-Stop-Worrying-And-Love-Deplatforming"], "top_image": ""}
