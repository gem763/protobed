(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)\n\nThe Houston Astros are back.\n\nAfter a two-game hiccup to begin the World Series, the Astros made it two straight wins after crushing the Washington Nationals 8-1 in Game 4. The series is now tied 2-2 heading into a pivotal Game 5 on Sunday night at Nationals Park.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThere were heroes all over the diamond for Houston. Some that we expected to be carrying the team four games deep into the World Series. Others that unexpectedly stepped up under the October spotlight.\n\nThe latter describes rookie starting pitcher Jose Urquidy. The 24-year-old right-hander was called upon to make his first postseason start in Game 4. He was expected to be no more than a one or two-inning opener, but instead posted Houston\u2019s best outing in this World Series by pitching five scoreless innings. In doing so, he joined elite company.\n\nAccording to @EliasSports Only one pitcher in the LCS era (since 1969) has had his first career postseason start be a scoreless one in the World Series. Jon Lester did it at Coors Field in Game 4 of the 2007 World Series - a series-clinching game for the Red Sox. \u2014 Marly Rivera (@MarlyRiveraESPN) October 27, 2019\n\nIt was Urquidy who set the tone, but it was AL MVP candidate Alex Bregman who closed the door on Game 4.\n\nHouston\u2019s third baseman slugged the second postseason grand slam in Astros history, joining Lance Berkman from 2005. The slam extended Houston\u2019s lead to 8-1 and put them in position to turn the series completely around with another win on Sunday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Astros had three multi-run innings in Game 4 after having just two through the first three games. They got off to a fast start, scoring two first-inning runs on run-scoring singles from Bregman and Yuli Gurriel. In the fourth, Robinson Chirinos made up for an inning-ending double play by launching a two-run homer \u2014 his second homer of the series.\n\nIt\u2019s taken help from role players, but this is the Astros team we expected to see in the World Series. That\u2019s bad news for Washington.\n\nWHO MADE THE DIFFERENCE\n\n\u2022 Jose Urquidy: Only the Astros know what they truly hoped to get from Urquidy. But it\u2019s safe to assume he surpassed even their highest expectations. Urquidy was flat filthy, limiting the Nationals to two hits while striking out four and walking none. Just as important, Urquidy limited the number of outs A.J. Hinch needed from his bullpen.\n\n\u2022 Michael Brantley and Alex Bregman: In Game 3, Brantley fueled the Astros offense with a pair of run-scoring hits. In Game 4, he helped set the table by racking up three more hits. He was along for the ride on Bregman\u2019s slam and is now hitting .500 (8 for 16) in the series. As for Bregman, he\u2019s up to seven RBIs in the World Series.\n\n\u2022 Robinson Chirinos: With all the talent playing in this World Series, who would have guessed Chirinos would be the first to hit two home runs? In fact, the 35-year-old catcher made it back-to-back games with a dinger. That doesn\u2019t happen often in the World Series.\n\nRobinson Chirinos is the 6th player to homer in back-to-back World Series games as catcher.\n\n\n\nThe others:\n\n1982 Ted Simmons\n\n1972 Gene Tenace\n\n1955 Roy Campanella\n\n1939 Bill Dickey\n\n1930 Mickey Cochrane\n\n\n\nNone did so in MORE THAN 2 straight. \u2014 Sarah Langs (@SlangsOnSports) October 27, 2019\n\nMUST-SEE MOMENT\n\nThe Astros provided plenty of must-see moments. We could show nearly every slider thrown by Jose Urquidy. We could show you Alex Bregman\u2019s grand slam. We could even show you Will Harris\u2019 huge strikeout of Howie Kendrick to end Washington\u2019s biggest threat in the sixth inning. But we won\u2019t, because this moment belongs to Yuli Gurriel.\n\nYuli Gurriel!! What an effort!\n\n\n\nNot often you see two dives on one play. pic.twitter.com/qrNVGLmPmO \u2014 FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 27, 2019\n\nWHAT THEY'LL BE TALKING ABOUT\n\nCan the Nationals rebound?: After having their eight-game postseason winning streak snapped in Game 3, we wondered how the Nationals would respond. Now that we\u2019ve seen the response, it might be fair to wonder if they\u2019ve let the series slip away completely. Yeah, they\u2019re still even. And yes, they\u2019ve already defeated Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander once. But the Astros as a whole looked off their game in Houston. It\u2019s a different story now.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nThe World Series continues Sunday night. First pitch for Game 5 is scheduled for 8:07 p.m. ET and the game will be broadcast on FOX.\n\nAll eyes will be on the pitching matchup as Washington's Max Scherzer takes on Houston's Gerrit Cole in a rematch from Game 1. Scherzer got the edge that time, tossing five innings of two-run ball in the Nationals\u2019 5-4 win. Cole went deeper in the game by throwing seven innings, but allowed five runs to suffer his first loss in 25 starts.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Houston Astros slugged their way to an 8-1 victory against the Washington Nationals in Game 4 of the World Series.
