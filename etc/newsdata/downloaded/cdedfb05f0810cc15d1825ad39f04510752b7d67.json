Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was able to pull off an upset over former Vice President Joe Biden in the Iowa caucuses, or if she was to make it close in the New Hampshire primary, African-American voters would switch their allegiance from Biden to Warren given she would appear to give Democrats the best shot at defeating President Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nSharpton said Biden gets much of his support from African-Americans because he was former President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president.\n\n\u201cA lot of Biden support in South Carolina is African-American voters,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cA lot of that is based on he was Barack Obama\u2019s vice president. If there is an upset in Iowa, even a close vote and New Hampshire, and it appears that Elizabeth Warren is the one that can beat Donald Trump, a lot of that vote will switch because a lot of the end of the pro-Biden vote or the pro-any-of-the-Democrats votes are based on anti-Trump, particular when a lot them would vote for anyone against Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is can we come up with somebody that can be Trump rather than just anybody,\u201d he continued. \u201cAn anti-Trump vote is one thing. An anti-vote because I like this person is another thing. But let\u2019s not forget Elizabeth Warren wasn\u2019t even in the discussion a few months ago. So she has come from someone everyone was laughing at and the Pocahontas thing to where everybody is discussion, \u2018Can she beat Trump?\u2019 That\u2019s a long way from where she started. I would not count her out.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "Friday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" network host and regular Al Sharpton predicted if Sen.
