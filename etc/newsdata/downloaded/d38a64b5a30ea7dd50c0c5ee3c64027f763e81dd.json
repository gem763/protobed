Donald Trump or California?\n\nThere\u2019s never been any love lost between the president and the Golden State, but now what had been a smoldering feud has become an all-out war. The implications are huge not just for California, but for other states, and in fact, for the very state of our union.\n\nI\u2019ll explain about the big picture, but first, about California.\n\nAs you may have heard, Trump and California have punched and counter-punched each other this week over California\u2019s auto emission standards, which are tougher than federal ones, even though automakers\u2014Ford (F), BMW (BMW.DE), Volkswagen (VOW.DE) and Honda (HMC)\u2014have sided with the Californians.\n\nThe Trump Administration is revoking California\u2019s Federal Waiver on emissions in order to produce far less expensive cars for the consumer, while at the same time making the cars substantially SAFER. This will lead to more production because of this pricing and safety...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom and his administration aren\u2019t shying away from the battle. \u201cThis is the fight of a lifetime for us,\u201d said Mary Nichols, the chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board. \u201cI believe we will win.\u201d Twenty-two other states have joined California (an important point here.) And the legal wrangling is expected to last months if not years and could reach the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Breaking: Just filed our 60th lawsuit against the Trump Administration over its attempt to trample our authority on clean car standards. Our coalition today is 24 AGs strong with LA and NYC joining us. #SaveCleanCars #ClimateAction https://t.co/fVGZzqx12S \u2014 Xavier Becerra (@AGBecerra) September 20, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s just the latest battle. The president and California are engaging on dozens of other legal fronts, including over laws governing the census, immigration and health care.\n\nBut even more than that, the California v. Trump tussle is emblematic of a bigger conflict playing out across the country right now, a growing power struggle between the states and the federal government. At issue is which entity has legal authority over everything from gun owner rights to marijuana.\n\nThe implications for business and investors are massive. Imagine a country with 50 sets of regulations and standards across every industry. We\u2019re not close to that yet, but the trend in our union at this point is moving clearly towards disunion.\n\nUS President Donald Trump speaks with members of the US Customs and Border Patrol as he tours the border wall between the United States and Mexico in Calexico, California.

Defining the power of the states versus the federal government has vexed our country since its inception. Who holds sway over taxation and education for instance has divided our nation, and of course the Civil War was fought over southern states wanting to maintain slavery.\n\nThis question, however, really began with a Revolutionary War soldier\u2019s unhappy homecoming.\n\nA veteran of Bunker Hill and other battles, Daniel Shays returned to western Massachusetts wounded, unpaid and in debt\u2014along with thousands of others. Feeling grossly maligned, Shays organized an armed revolt. The army had been disbanded and our nascent federal government had no funds, so merchants in eastern Massachusetts raised a militia on their own to fight Shays and his rebels. In January 1787, Shays attacked a federal armory in Springfield, where he was repulsed, with four of his men killed and 20 wounded. The rebellion was quelled the next month in a bitter snowstorm and Shays died in 1825, his lot little improved by what is called Shays\u2019 Rebellion.\n\nBut Shays\u2019 Rebellion had huge consequences for America. It highlighted the weakness of the federal government under the Articles of Confederation and inspired the creation of the U.S. Constitution in 1789 under a Federalist system with its signature division of power between the states and the federal government. Exactly how much power each side should have, however, wasn\u2019t explicitly spelled out and has been a source of friction ever since.", "description": "There\u2019s never been any love lost between Trump and the Golden State, but now what had been a smoldering feud has become an all-out war.", "authors": ["Andy Serwer", "Editor In Chief"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/udbu5kGtBAtD6IZ_5zyeXw--~B/aD0zMzc3O3c9NTA1ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-05/0d617ef0-83ea-11e9-bbdd-7ef374b1a08b", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
