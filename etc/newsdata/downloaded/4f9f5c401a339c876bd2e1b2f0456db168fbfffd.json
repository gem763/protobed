Natalie Boog\n\nCorley interviewed 233 people with at least $US160,000 ($236,700) in annual gross income and $US3.2 million in net assets, 177 of whom were self-made. Through these interviews and analysis, Corley uncovered dozens of facts about rich people and their daily habits to piece together exactly how they got to where they are today.\n\nIn his book, Corley writes that 80 per cent of the self-made millionaires he studied didn\u2019t get wealthy until after age 50, but almost all of them started the same way.\n\n\u201cThe self-made millionaires in my study all set a goal of saving 10 to 20 per cent of their income during their pre-millionaire years,\u201d Corley wrote.
