REUTERS/Amanda Perobelli\n\nFarmers and analysts shared pictures and videos of their crops, with trees full of flowers or flower buds. Agronomists say a good flowering, ample and uniform, followed by adequate moisture and mild temperatures, could lead to good production.\n\n\u201cIn general, flowering was good, but we are anxious about the next rains and praying for temperatures to stay bland,\u201d said Mariana Caetano, chief operating officer at Guima Caf\u00e9s, a coffee producer controlled by Brazilian bank BMG, with 900 hectares in the Cerrado region in Minas Gerais.\n\nShe said rains had been scarce all around, below historical levels, and that the company had kept trees healthy using dripping irrigation. Reservoirs were running low, however, and Caetano was unsure whether irrigation levels could be maintained if rains faltered.\n\nPaulo Piancastelli, who manages 210 hectares of coffee fields in the Triangulo Mineiro region, said the flowering was positive.\n\n\u201cWe farmers end up sharing the best pictures we take, in places where there are more flowers, which are pretty. That way, we put some more pressure on prices,\u201d he joked.\n\nIn fact, arabica coffee prices fell this week in New York, with traders commenting about the flowering, which could lead to a large crop next year in the world\u2019s largest producer if weather conditions were adequate.\n\nHaroldo Bonf\u00e1, a coffee expert at Pharos Consultancy in Sao Paulo, said the pretty photos and videos shared on social media could be misleading.\n\n\u201cNot all fields are the same. It was not a uniform occurrence,\u201d he said, indicating many areas were not in good shape due to dryer-than-normal weather and lower crop care.\n\nHe said it was hard to assess how much of the flowering would turn into fruit to boost the 2020 crop. \u201cWe will probably have to wait until the end of October, early November to estimate numbers.\u201d\n\nRains are expected in coming days, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon\u2019s Agriculture Weather Dashboard, with up to 90 millimeters (3.54 inches) in the southern part of Minas Gerais.", "description": "Coffee trees all over Brazil's top producing state Minas Gerais have bloomed this week, marking the first major flowering for the new Brazilian coffee crop that could indicate the size of next year's production.", "authors": ["Marcelo Teixeira", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439290815&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991C6", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
