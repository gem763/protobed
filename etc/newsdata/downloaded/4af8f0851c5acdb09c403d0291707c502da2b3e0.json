A blue Scania truck that he was driving has been impounded by the police.\n\nJoanna Maher, 38, and her haulage boss husband Thomas, also 38, from Warrington, - the last known owners of the lorry carrying 39 migrants - were also arrested yesterday in a dawn raid.\n\nThey have been held on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter.\n\nHoang Thi Thuong, wife of Nguyen Dinh Tu, a Vietnamese suspected victim in a truck container in UK, holds her son Nguyen Dinh Dan at their home in Nghe An province, Vietnam\n\nAnna Bui Thi Nhung (right) and Nguyen Dinh Tu (left), both from Vietnam, have both now been named as suspected victims.\n\nEssex Police are investigating lines of inquiry to 'establish whether there is a wider conspiracy involved' in the deaths of 39 people found in a lorry in Grays on Wednesday, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore said\n\nThe family Pham Thi Tra My, 26, say she paid people smugglers \u00a330,000 to travel to the UK via China 'in search of a better life.'

Essex Police initially believed the victims were Chinese nationals.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore told reporters today that the nationality of the victims is not yet known, but the focus is now on the Vietnamese community - although 'there may be other nationalities involved'.\n\nWho has been arrested so far? As police in the UK continue their investigations into the 39 migrants who lost their lives trying to enter the country, we keep track of who has been arrested so far. Lorry driver Maurice Mo Robinson: Arrested on suspicion of murder, police also given extra time to quiz the 25-year-old. Mo Robinson is the truck driver arrested after 39 people were found dead in the back of a lorry he was driving Joanna Maher, 38, and her husband Thomas, also 38: The Warrington couple who previously told MailOnline they had sold the container are understood to have been held on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter. Mrs Maher, a mother-of-three, pictured with her trucker boss husband Thomas, told MailOnline that she sold the lorry involved in the deaths of 39 migrants to an Irish haulage firm 13 months ago 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland: The latest arrest took place at Stansted Airport. The identity of the man has not yet been revealed, but police said he has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and suspicion of manslaughter. 20-year-old man from Northern Ireland: The man was arrested after getting off a ferry on Saturday afternoon.A blue Scania truck that he was driving has been impounded by the police.\n\nHe said he had met with Vietnamese ambassador Tran Ngoc An, who had visited the civic centre in Grays to pay tribute to the victims.\n\nDCI Pasmore said there were 'very, very few' identity documents recovered and that police will share fingerprints with Vietnamese authorities in a bid to identify the bodies.\n\nAll of the bodies have now been moved from the truck in Tilbury Docks to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, for post-mortem examinations to be carried out.\n\nCommenting on reports the lorry could have been part of a convoy of three carrying around 100 people, Mr Pasmore said investigators remain 'open-minded'.\n\n'There are lines of inquiry that are set of course to establish whether or not there are wider conspiracies involved in this and the lines of inquiry are set to identify the wider conspiracy, but I can say no more than that,' he said.\n\nHe added that the force was focusing its attention on the Vietnamese community and appealed for those within it with any information to come forward, regardless of their immigration status.\n\nHe said: \u2018What I can say is that Essex police will not take any action against any individual that comes forward. If you feel that a family member is a victim, then please get in touch.\u2019\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, DCI Passmore added: \u2018There are people who might be in the UK illegally and are frightened to come forward. We are aware that people are communicating on websites, particularly within the Vietnamese community.\n\n\u2018Please take that leap of faith, communicate with us. We all want one common thing; that\u2019s to identify the victims and reunite them with their loved ones.\u2019\n\nDCI Passmore said that \u2018very few\u2019 of the victims had any kind of identity documents on them and that the identification process would take a considerable amount of time.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a long, painstaking process that will involve examining the post mortem reports, DNA, any distinguishing marks, information coming from abroad and from the Vietnamese community,\u2019 he added.\n\nThe BBC said it has been in contact with six Vietnamese families who fear their relatives are among the dead, with some having the smuggling fees repaid.\n\nAnna Bui Thi Nhung, 19, and Nguyen Dinh Tu, both from Vietnam, were named as suspected victims today.\n\nPham Thi Tra My, 26, and Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, are also suspected among the dead, with the former sending her mother a series of harrowing messages telling her she 'loved her' and was 'dying because she couldn't breathe'.\n\nIn a photo released by the family of Nguyen Dinh Luong shows Nguyen, 20, posing for a selfie in this undated photo.

Sources have now claimed that bloodied hand marks were found inside\n\nOne of the newly named suspected victims, Nguyen Dinh Tu, had a few months ago asked his wife Hoang Thi Thuong to help him raise \u00a311,000 ($14,000) to cover the cost of an illicit trip from Germany to the United Kingdom.\n\n'I lost contact with him on October 21,' Thuong said with tears in her eyes. 'I have a big debt to pay, no hope, and no energy to do anything'.\n\nTu's father said relatives in the United Kingdom had told him that Tu was inside the truck, and had been planning to pick him up.\n\n'They were supposed to pick him up at the drop-off point but they called and said Tu was in that truck,' Tu's father, Nguyen Dinh Sat, said.\n\n'I haven't heard anything from my son'.\n\nThe mother and a sister of Anna Bui Thi Nhung cried as they set up an altar with incense and a photo of the missing 19-year-old where family and friends can pray at their home in Do Thanh village.\n\nThe family heard from a friend living in the UK that 'Nhung is one of the victims,' said one of Nhung's relatives, who was visiting the missing teen's despaired mother.\n\nNhung paid an agent over $10,000 with the hope of entering the U.K. to work as a nail technician, the relative said.\n\nNhung and many others from Yen Thanh district, where the village is located, some 200 kilometers (120 miles) south of Hanoi, travel abroad looking to make the type of money they cannot earn back home. One of their main goals is to send back enough to allow their families to build large homes that they would otherwise be unable to afford.\n\n'Many families in Yen Thanh have gotten rich from money sent back by their children working abroad,' said Le Dinh Tuan, one of Nhung's neighbors, who was at the house.\n\nA representative for VietHome, a U.K.-based organization that assists the local Vietnamese community, said the group sent photos of nearly 20 people reported missing to British police.\n\nAnother suspected victim, Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her mother a series of harrowing messages telling her she 'loved her' and was 'dying because she couldn't breathe' in the moments before her death, her family have claimed.\n\nThey claim to have paid people smugglers \u00a330,000 for their daughter to travel to the UK via China 'in search of a better life'.\n\nPham Thi Tra My (left) had texted her mother whilst taking the journey to the UK. The family of Nguyen Dinh Luong (right) are also concerned for his safety\n\nThe Vietnamese migrants are all thought to have travelled from the same district, the Can Loc district, which is pictured right. In text messages sent at 10.28pm GMT on Tuesday, Pham Thi Tra told her mother, 'I love you so much...I'm sorry.' Pictured left, the screenshot of Tra My's last text\n\nThe home of 26-year-old Pham Thi Tra My in Vietnam's Ha Tinh province. She is feared to be among the 39 people found dead in a lorry\n\nHer parents, Nguyen Thi Phong and Pham Van Thin (right), have said it was 'very painful' to receive the text - saying she must have known she was going to die when she sent it\n\nNguyen Thi Phong and Pham Van Thin, told CNN it was 'very painful' to receive the text - saying she must have known she was going to die when she sent it.\n\n'I've lost both my loved one and my money,' her father Pham said, claiming he and his partner scraped together the money to pay for their daughter to travel to the UK.\n\nThe pair, who make around $400 a month between them, said the smugglers did not tell them how their daughter would be transported to the UK.\n\n'The smugglers said that this was a ... safe route, that people would go by airplane, car ... if I had known she would go by this route, I would not have let her go,' Pham added.\n\nIt comes as it was revealed the migrants, six of whom were thought to have been Vietnamese, were naked or had minimal clothing when they were found in the container on Wednesday in Purfleet, Essex.\n\nIt is also believed that the Vietnamese migrants are all from the Can Loc district in northern Vietnam and had been 'banging on the doors' for help and had 'foam coming from their mouths' when found.\n\nA human rights worker in Vietnam, who was spoken with Tra My's family, today revealed she made the perilous journey because her family was in debt and she was desperately trying to help them.\n\n'She had just returned from Japan where she was working to try and pay off the debt. And that was not enough and so she looked for a better future,' she told the BBC.\n\nAsking to remain anonymous, the human rights worker continued: 'For this girl it is very sad that she took the risk because she was dealing with debt that was created by another man in the family.\n\n'And I also learnt that the service that she was using was called 'very important service' and so it is like a business class ticket on the lorry and with that she had to pay double or three times the price of the cheap ticket.'\n\nAnother of the suspected victims was revealed to be Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20 (pictured)\n\nEssex Police are investigating lines of inquiry to 'establish whether there is a wider conspiracy involved' in the deaths of 39 people found in a lorry in Grays on Wednesday, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore said\n\nThe human rights worker added that migrants are told they can vast amounts of money by moving to the UK, and the 26-year-old may have been convinced to purchase a 'VIP ticket' to get there.\n\nHe family mortgaged the house to get that money for her, the human rights worked added.\n\nPham Thi Tra's last text messages were sent at 10.28pm BST on Tuesday - two hours before the truck reached the UK, as it was en route from Belgium.\n\nShe told her mother: 'I'm sorry Mum. My journey abroad hasn't succeeded. Mum, I love you so much. I'm dying because I can't breathe.'\n\nTra My's brother told the BBC on Friday that his sister had told them not to contact her because 'the organisers' did not allow her to receive calls.\n\nHe said she flew to China from her home in Can L\u1ed9c, a rural district of H\u00e0 T\u0129nh Province in Vietnam, then left for France and initially attempted to cross the border into the UK on October 19, but 'got caught' and turned back.\n\nHunt for second lorry driver who was caught on CCTV dropping off container in Belgium with 39 doomed migrants Police in Belgium have obtained CCTV footage of the haulier who transported the 39 migrants in a freezing container to the UK, after he was filmed ten times at the Zeebrugge site. Cameras at the port terminal in Belgium snapped the vehicle as it went through the security port terminal, carrying 31 men and eight women. The terminal is managed by Luxembourg-based company C.RO which is believed to have handed footage to police - a development which could reveal who transported the migrants on the continental part of their ill-fated journey. According to The Times, police are now focusing their attentions on the driver who delivered the container to the Belgium port and the CCTV footage may be able to identify them. Dutch language newspaper Het Nieuwsblad quoted one source, thought to have been a Belgium official as saying: 'We hope to catch him soon. His truck was filmed ten times at the port site'. The driver who delivered the unit is thought to have dismissed normal protocol and failed to identify himself, or provide a waybill upon arrival at the port. It raises questions about the security of ports across Europe, as the UK are believed to have sent equipment to terminals such as Zeebrugge in order to thwart people smuggling.\n\nTra My is thought be among the eight women and 31 men who were discovered inside the 'metal coffin' lorry container on Wednesday morning. The Vietnamese families of a 26-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman have also contacted the BBC raising fears they could be among those dead.\n\nAnother of the suspected victims was revealed to be Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20.\n\nHis father Nguyen Dinh Gia said his son told him two weeks ago he planned to travel to Britain from France, where he had been living illegally since 2018.\n\nHe said he would pay 11,000 pounds ($14,000) for the journey and planned to work in a nail salon when he got to Britain.\n\nBut Gia got a call several days ago from a Vietnamese man saying 'Please have some sympathy, something unexpected happened,' he told AFP.\n\n'I fell to the ground when I heard that,' Gia told AFP.\n\n'It seemed that he was in the truck with the accident, all of them dead,' he added.\n\nHis father told The Associated Press he had not been able to reach him since last week. He had said he would join a group in Paris that was trying to reach England.\n\n'He often called home but I haven't been able to reach him since the last time we talked last week,' Nguyen Dinh Gia said. 'I told him that he could go to anywhere he wants as long as it's safe. He shouldn't be worry about money, I'll take care of it.'\n\nHe said his son left home in central Ha Tinh province to work in Russia in 2017, then on to Ukraine. In April 2018, he arrived in Germany then traveled to France. He told his family that he wanted to go to the U.K.\n\nLuong's older brother, Pham Dinh Hai, said that Luong had a tattoo of praying hands on a cross on his right shoulder. The family said they shared the information with local authorities.\n\nBoth suspected victims are from Ha Tinh, an impoverished province in a part of Vietnam where many of the country's illegal migrants come from.\n\nMany have their sights set on Britain, where they end up working in nail salons or on cannabis farms, hoping for quick riches.\n\nThey can pay smugglers up to $40,000 for the dangerous journey across eastern Europe - often via China or Russia - an enormous sum in Vietnam where the annual per capital income is around $2,400, according to the World Bank.\n\nThose who cannot pay upfront often have to work off their debt to traffickers, which may include a fee for falsified documents.\n\nThis is while a third Vietnamese family said a 19-year-old woman was missing after calling relatives at 6.20am on Tuesday to say she was getting into a container and was turning her phone off.\n\nBernie Gravett, a former Metropolitan police officer who now advises the EU on human trafficking, said families trying to help their loved ones travel abroad would pay large sums of money to smugglers.\n\nHe told BBC Breakfast: 'In Vietnam it is assessed at 20 to 30,000 US dollars, from China it's 40 to 50,000 US dollars.'\n\nMr Gravett said identifying the victims found in Essex would be a hard and long process due to the possible use of false identification documents and the numbers of people travelling to Europe.\n\nHe said: 'It's a cruel stage for the families, because hundreds if not thousands are currently on those routes, so I appreciate we are getting calls from Vietnam saying my loved one is missing and my loved one may be on that lorry but they could be on another lorry.\n\n'These lorries are coming through on a weekly basis, we have just found one, others get through undetected and the victims then go on to be exploited in the UK.'\n\nMr Gravett added: 'Victims will be given fake documents, so with Chinese generally they are given Korean documents or other documents depending on the country of destination.\n\n'Most often they are stripped of all documentation so that when they get to the UK then documents are provided relating to this country.'\n\nIt comes as detectives are continuing to question four people over the migrant deaths.\n\nA 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland was detained at Stansted Airport on Friday on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and manslaughter, Essex Police said.\n\nForensic officers are pictured above doing a full sweep of the lorry which had been carrying the migrants across the world\n\nSince Wednesday four people have been arrested in connection with the death of the 39 migrants. Police had initially believed they had come from China\n\nThis harrowing image shows a fleet of private ambulances arriving at Tilbury Docks to take away the victims on Friday\n\nFinal journey: How the 39 tragic migrants ended up in Purfleet, Essex, dead in the back of a refrigerated biscuit lorry\n\nOfficers had earlier arrested a couple, haulage boss Thomas Maher and his wife Joanna, both 38, of Warrington, on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter and people trafficking.\n\nIt followed the arrest of the driver of the Scania truck on suspicion of murder on Wednesday, who remains in custody.\n\nOn Thursday, detectives were granted more time to question Mo Robinson, 25, from Northern Ireland, after the bodies of eight women and 31 men were found in the refrigerated trailer in an industrial park in Grays in the early hours of Wednesday.\n\nIn Belgium, police are hunting the driver who delivered the trailer to Zeebrugge, the port it left before arriving in the UK.\n\nA spokesman from the Belgian prosecutor's office said: 'We're trying to identify the driver.'\n\nHe said Belgian authorities were also working to 'track the route of the container' and find anyone responsible for 'collaborating with the transport'.\n\n'We would like people to be arrested as soon as possible,' he added.\n\nThe Maher's told MailOnline that they sold the lorry cab a year ago to a company in Ireland - but police officers investigating the tragedy raided their property yesterday. The refrigerated trailer carrying the 39 frozen trafficking victims is believed to be owned by a rental firm in Dublin.\n\nA Cheshire Police patrol car arrived at the Irish couple's house at 7am on Thursday before up to a dozen police officers went inside at around Midday - just before the arrests were announced. The pair have not been seen.\n\nEarlier this week Mrs Maher told MailOnline: 'It's the cab - my name was down as owning it.\n\n'We did own it but sold it 13 months ago', adding they sold it to a company in County Monaghan, close to where truck driver Maurice 'Mo' Robinson, 25, lives.\n\nPolice are also questioning the Northern Irish trucker for the third day with a decision on whether to charge him with murder or release him.\n\nAn Essex Police spokesman said: 'We have carried out warrants in Cheshire as part of the investigation into 39 bodies being discovered in a lorry trailer in Grays.\n\n'As a result, a 38-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman from Warrington have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter. A 25-year-old man, the driver of the lorry, remains in custody on suspicion of murder'.\n\nThe industrial estate where the 39 migrants were found frozen to death in the back of a lorry remains sealed off on Friday as police questioned the driver for a third day\n\nPolice at the Warrington home of Joanna Maher, 38, and her husband Thomas, also 38, yesterday where the couple are understood to have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter\n\nRobinson arrived in the UK at the weekend after a ferry from Dublin to Holyhead. He picked up the trailer, which had been shipped from Zeebrugge to Purfleet. Minutes later, he pulled into the Essex industrial estate and the alarm was raised\n\nTwo houses have been raided by police in Northern Ireland - one belonging to the lorry driver in Markethill and the other belonging to his parents in Laurelvale, both Co Armagh. A third house in Armagh City has also been raided\n\nThe container carrying migrants had previously criss-crossed the Channel via refugee hotspots in the week before it arrived in Britain with 39 frozen bodies inside, perhaps for several days, it was revealed yesterday.\n\nYesterday their bodies were moved by private ambulance from Tilbury docks to Chelmsford mortuary for post-examinations that will run into next week.\n\nEssex Police initially believed all of the dead were Chinese nationals, but the force said at a press conference 'this is now a developing picture' amid reports several may be Vietnamese.\n\nDeputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills said she would give no more details about the nationalities of the victims until formal identification had taken place.\n\nThe BBC said it has been in contact with six Vietnamese families who fear their relatives are among the dead, with some having the smuggling fees repaid.\n\nRelatives of 26-year-old Pham Tra My told the broadcaster they have not been able to contact her since she sent a text on Tuesday night saying she was suffocating.\n\n'I am really, really sorry, Mum and Dad, my trip to a foreign land has failed,' she wrote.\n\n'I am dying, I can't breathe. I love you very much Mum and Dad. I am sorry, Mother.'\n\nHer family said they had paid \u00a330,000 for her to be smuggled into Britain, which has now been repaid.\n\nIf the fridge on the hermetically sealed trailer was not running there would be no air coming in, suffocating people inside, according to Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association.\n\nIt is not yet known when the victims entered the trailer, where temperatures can be as low as minus 25C if the fridge is activated, or the exact route it travelled.\n\nBelgian officials said the trailer arrived at Zeebrugge at 2.49pm on Tuesday and left the port the same day en route to Purfleet.\n\nThe trailer arrived at Purfleet at around 12.30am on Wednesday, and was picked up by the cab, known as the tractor, which arrived from Northern Ireland via Holyhead in North Wales on Sunday.\n\nThe lorry left the port at Purfleet shortly after 1.05am before police were called to the Waterglade Industrial Park on Eastern Avenue in Grays at 1.40am.\n\nChina has called for joint efforts to counter human smuggling, while vigils have been held in London and Belfast to pay tribute to the victims.\n\nThe Vietnamese embassy in London has said some families have contacted them asking about relatives but it is yet to receive any information from police.\n\nMastermind in misery: Brutal rise and fall of 'Snakehead' gang leader 'Sister Ping' - as it emerges Triad-linked mob use Chinese version of TINDER to lure desperate families to UK with offers of '100% safe travel' for '\u00a320,000 fee' Snakeshead kingpin, Cheng Chui Ping, also known as 'Sister Ping', who ran the world's largest people smuggling network for 20 years until her death in a US jail By Tracy You and Martin Robinson The trafficking gang believed to have smuggled the tragic 39 Asian migrants into Britain was built by a ruthless Chinese matriarch known as the 'Mother of all Snakeheads' who made millions from trafficking during a 20-year reign of terror. Gangland boss Sister Ping died in a Texas prison in 2014 where she was serving 35 years for building the world's most sophisticated network of people smugglers who brought up to 200,000 illegal immigrants into America alone. At her New York trial in 2005 she was described as 'evil incarnate' who had made a fortune moving generations of Chinese people around the world for \u00a320,000 since the early 1980s. This debt would either be paid back in wages from menial work in the West - or relatives back in the Chinese province of Fujian, known as the country's 'cradle of human smuggling', would be forced at gunpoint to take out a loan from Sister Ping's own sharks. Police eventually traced Sister Ping to China Town in New York and put her in the dock for people smuggling. But despite her incarceration and death her snakehead gang is still going strong - although its new leader is not yet known. Without her the gang is moving with the times and using social media apps including China's equivalent to Tinder, MoMo, as well as popular messaging app WeChat, promising '100 per cent safe travel'. The south-eastern province of Fujian in China has a long histories of sending migrants abroad for cash Traffickers are using social media apps including China's equivalent to Tinder, MoMo (pictured), as well as popular messaging app WeChat Adverts with attractive slogans such as 'speedy passage of border checks! Pay upon arrival!' are circulating on apps. People dreaming of a new life away from China pay an online deposit as low as 5,000 yuan (\u00a3550) before being crammed into boats or containers for a long, dark and risky journey, local media reported. Chinese, particularly those with lower education levels, continue to be drawn to Europe and North America by the promise of much higher wages than they can earn at home, despite the considerable risks involved. The victims would flee home hoping for a better life in the UK - but their journey to Britain would be miserable and dangerous, spending up to a month in the back of lorries in dangerous and squalid conditions. Most would be flown from China to Serbia and then transported by road through Hungary, Austria, France before a boat to Britain from Belgium or Holland. Mike Gradwell, a former Lancashire Police detective superintendent who worked on the probe into the Morecambe Bay cockling tragedy in which 23 Chinese illegal immigrants drowned, told BBC Breakfast that those in the trailer were most likely trafficked by Snakehead gangs. He said: 'These are criminal travel agents really - you go to a Snakehead to say you want to be trafficked to an economic opportunity and usually you'll borrow quite a significant amount of money.' He said relatives were likely to have been in contact with those being trafficked, who may have been carrying phones which could be used by police to help identify them. Lisa Yam, a lawyer specialising in Chinese immigration, told the programme: 'We find it is quite difficult to believe why we still have so many Chinese that choose to come into the country (like this).'\n\n'The migrant minibuses wait there all night': How quiet Essex port at centre of death truck tragedy 'comes alive at night' as ruthless traffickers exchange human cargo under cover of darkness\n\nPeople-smuggling operations are so rife at the port where 39 migrants were found dead this week that there is said to be a 'migrant minibus service'.\n\nFormer port security guard Gary Lilley, 61, has described how Purfleet on the River Thames in Essex 'comes alive at night' with the arrival of trafficked migrants.\n\nMr Lilley, who lives opposite the port where he worked for six weeks in 2012, also claimed minibuses meet lorries to take away the migrants following their arrival.\n\nLorries are pictured outside the Purfleet Thames Terminal in Essex on Wednesday\n\nAn aerial view of Purfleet Port (file image) where 39 migrants were found dead this week. Police have now gone back on original claims that the migrants were Chinese\n\nHe told The Times that there is a 'notorious' lay-by near the port where migrants ditch their documents so UK authorities don't know where to repatriate them to.\n\nHe added: 'Minibuses wait there at night for them to arrive. Last summer during the heatwave I gave water bottles to two five-year-old girls as they looked desperate.\n\n'They were standing by the side of the road in a group of about 15. At the lay-by you see the lorries pull up and the migrants pop their heads out to see if it's safe.\n\n'On many occasions I've seen minibuses pull up and they jump in and are driven off. It's so organised.'\n\nPurfleet in Essex is said to 'come alive at night' with the arrival of trafficked migrants\n\nMinibuses are said to meet lorries to take away the migrants following their arrival at Purfleet\n\nPolice drive the lorry along a road from the scene at Waterglade Industrial Park on Wednesday\n\nSmugglers put on 'mini bus service' to deal with demand in Purfleet Last night it was revealed that the Thames port where the migrants were found 'comes alive at night' with new arrivals. A former security guard told The Times that smuggling is so well organised in the area that mini buses meet the migrants and take them away. Gary Lilley worked at the port for around six weeks as a security guard seven years ago. He said: 'The port comes alive at around 2am. I've seen groups of migrants walking out the front door of the port with carrier bags. 'When there's a group of them a few security guards on minimum wage aren't going to stop them.
