The party said on Tuesday that its chairperson Ivan Lam was \"taken away by officers\" upon arrival at Hong Kong airport.\n\n\"He will be arrested with inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly,\" Demosisto said on its Twitter account.\n\nDemonstrations over the weekend saw some of the worst violence in weeks between protesters and police.\n\nProtesters threw petrol bombs, lit fires and attacked the city's parliament building, while police used tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon, and fired live warning shots.\n\nIn another development, the Spanish fashion chain Zara strongly denied supporting the protests after being criticised in Chinese state media for closing some of its Hong Kong stores during Monday's demonstrations.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Zara expressed support for China's sovereignty over Hong Kong and said it had \"always supported the one country, two systems\" policy.\n\nChina's Global Times newspaper had demanded \"a solemn explanation\" from the retailer. Some reports said stores delayed opening after staff struggled to get in because of the protests.\n\nA guide to the Hong Kong protests", "description": "The Hong Kong leader denies she sought to step down after leaked audio suggested she wanted to.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07m9h1t.jpg"}
