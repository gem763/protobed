Apple was already known to manufacture its older smartphone models in India like the 6's 7's and the iPhone SE.

By shifting the manufacturing of Apple's cheapest Face ID smartphone in India, Apple saves from shelling out a hefty 20-percent import duty that was levied on phones manufactured outside of India.\n\nIndian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has also gone ahead and slashed corporate tax rates to as low as 15% for companies looking to invest in India.\n\nHowever, these financial easements won't translate in the pricing of the smartphone going any lower than it already has.
