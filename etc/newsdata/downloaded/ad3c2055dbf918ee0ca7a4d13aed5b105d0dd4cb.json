He died in 2010.\n\nWHAT IS AUTISM AND WHAT IS THE CAUSE? Autism is a lifelong developmental disability that affects how people perceive the world and interact with others. Autism is a spectrum condition meaning people are affected in different ways, although share some difficulties. The causes of autism are still being investigated. Many experts believe that the pattern of behaviour from which autism is diagnosed may not result from a single cause. There is strong evidence to suggest that autism can be caused by a variety of physical factors, all of which affect brain development. There is evidence to suggest that genetic factors are responsible for some forms of autism. Scientists have been attempting to identify which genes might be implicated in autism for some years. Autism is likely to have multiple genes responsible rather than a single gene. The difficulty of establishing gene involvement is compounded by the interaction of genes and by their interaction with environmental factors. For these reasons genetic testing to diagnose a pre-disposition to an autistic spectrum disorder is not, at present, possible. In the past, a number of things were linked to the cause of autism, but extensive research has found no evidence to support them. These include the measles (MMR) vaccine, thiomersal \u2013 a mercury compound used as a preservative in some vaccines, the way a person has been brought up, diet, pollution, emotional deprivation or maternal infections in pregnancy.
