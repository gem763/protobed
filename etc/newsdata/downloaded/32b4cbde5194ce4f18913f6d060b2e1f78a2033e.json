The actor\u2019s ability to convey paternal irritation with comedic flair became a hallmark of nearly all his performances. Whether playing the kitchen-supervising father of Ice Cube\u2019s shiftless protagonist, Craig, in the cult hit Friday, or the working-class dad of David Alan Grier\u2019s white-collar nerd, Gerard, in Boomerang, Witherspoon channeled the weariness and candor of community elders. Now, as family, former co-stars, and fans react to the news of his death, it\u2019s that same combination of hilarity and wisdom that many are citing as they reflect on Witherspoon\u2019s life and career. To them, he wasn\u2019t just a comic; he was \u201cPops,\u201d the nickname that stuck long after he stopped playing that character on the sitcom The Wayans Bros.\n\nWitherspoon died just one day after posting a new video to his YouTube series, \u201cCooking for Poor People.\u201d \u201cIt is with deepest sorrow that we can confirm our beloved husband and father, John Witherspoon, one of the hardest working men in show business, died today at his home in Sherman Oaks at the age of 77,\u201d his family said yesterday in a statement to Deadline. In a tweet posted to Witherspoon\u2019s account, the family also said, \u201cHe was a Legend in the entertainment industry, and a father figure to all who watched him over the years. We love you \u2018POPS\u2019 always & forever.\u201d\n\nMany of the actors who worked with Witherspoon also included nods to his fatherly wisdom in their tributes. \u201cMy dad, my grandpa, my comedic inspiration! I love you Spoons! Rest In Paradise, King,\u201d the actor Regina King, who starred alongside him in Friday and The Boondocks, tweeted. Marlon Wayans, who played Witherspoon\u2019s son on The Wayans Bros., wrote on Instagram that he is \u201cextremely grateful to God that i got to spend 5 years of my life working with one of the funniest sweetest wisest humblest loving [men] ... my tv dad and my mentor and my friend.\u201d\n\nThe Roots drummer and DJ Questlove summarized the familiarity of Witherspoon\u2019s comedic repertoire in heartfelt prose: \u201cJohn Witherspoon resonated with every last one of us because he represented someone in our family: embarrassing us at gatherings (Boomerang), misrepresenting our generation\u2019s heroes (\u201cPublic Enema\u201d?!), making a jingle about pretty much everything (Grandpa on Boondocks), the neighborhood wino (Black Jesus\u2014or better yet Hollywood Shuffle)\u2014the list is endless.\u201d\n\nHouse Party gave audiences \u201cPublic Enema,\u201d but Witherspoon\u2019s breakout role came a few years later, in Friday. The F. Gary Gray\u2013directed film went on to inspire two sequels, Next Friday and Friday After Next. (In May, Ice Cube said the final installment of the series, Last Friday, would be released next year.) As Mr. Jones, Witherspoon often conveyed his frustration with his son\u2019s antics via physical humor. After catching Craig snacking in the kitchen despite not contributing anything to the household, Mr. Jones delivered a fervent lecture while chewing grapes loudly. When he ushered Craig into the bathroom to offer some advice, he created a dramatic production of spraying air freshener to cover the scent while ignoring his son\u2019s visible discomfort.", "description": "The late actor, who died at the age of 77, was best known for his singular ability to convey fatherly frustration with comedic flair.", "authors": ["Hannah Giorgis"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_81784197/facebook.jpg?1572456296", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
