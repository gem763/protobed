But this time he had a solution. As White House advisers listened astonished, he ordered them to shut down the entire 2,000-mile border with Mexico \u2014 by noon the next day.\n\nThe advisers feared the president\u2019s edict would trap American tourists in Mexico, strand children at schools on both sides of the border and create an economic meltdown in two countries. Yet they also knew how much the president\u2019s zeal to stop immigration had sent him lurching for solutions, one more extreme than the next.\n\nPrivately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That\u2019s not allowed either, they told him.\n\n\u201cThe president was frustrated and I think he took that moment to hit the reset button,\u201d said Thomas D. Homan, who had served as Mr. Trump\u2019s acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, recalling that week in March. \u201cThe president wanted it to be fixed quickly.\u201d", "description": "Over a frenzied few days in the spring, an internal White House debate led to turnover in staff and a turning point for the president\u2019s immigration agenda.", "authors": ["Michael D.
