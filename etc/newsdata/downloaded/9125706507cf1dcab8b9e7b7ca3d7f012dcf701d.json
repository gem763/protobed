This is designed to allow registered businesses to delay submitting customs declarations and paying of customs duties on imports from the EU to the UK.", "description": "The flow of goods across the UK-EU border could be cut by more than half in the event of a no-deal Brexit on October 31, according to the most up-to-date assessment by Whitehall\u2019s efficiency watchdog.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/39016c12d988112f783cdb45c926522be05d699a", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
