In fact, some might say that Italy should have had two players sent off. Aided by Nicola Quaglio, Vermeulen was picked up by his feet and speared head-first into the turf.\n\nAzzurri coach Conor O\u2019Shea didn\u2019t hold back.\n\nOf the incident, he said: \u201cAt 17-3, we had to hang in and do something and we get to the start of the second half, we\u2019re close to the line and then just crass stupidity, crass stupidity\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m destroyed really for everybody because we worked so hard,\u201d added the coach, whose team must now beat defending champions New Zealand to have any hope of reaching the quarter-finals.\n\n\u201cI thought the boys fought valiantly but when you\u2019re down in numbers against a great side, it\u2019s just impossible,\u201d he said.\n\nIt also means that the 2019 Rugby World Cup is likely to break the record for the most red cards at a tournament, even if red cards are a rare occurrence.\n\nAccording to the Extra Time Media website, with four red cards dished out so far, the tournament is already tied with 1995 and 1999 for that dishonour.\n\nAnd 2019 is some way ahead of 2015 when just one red card was issued. The year 2003 stands out as the only unblemished tournament.\n\nAs for the teams behaving badly, Canada, Samoa and Tonga top that group with three cards apiece. The Canadians particularly 'excelled' themselves back in 1995 with two red cards in one game. Anoraks might recall that game as the \u201cBattle of Boet Erasmus\u201d - the same game in which James Dalton was also sent off.\n\nSpeaking of the Springboks, they are level on two red cards across all tournaments with Uruguay and Wales. Argentina, Australia, Fiji, Italy, Namibia and the USA all have one.\n\nThe second Springbok to have received his marching order (after Dalton)?\n\nCentre Brendan Venter in the 1999 World Cup match against Uruguay.", "description": "After a moment of utter madness, Italy\u2019s Andrea Lovotti was given his marching orders against the Springboks.", "authors": ["Antoinette Muller"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7884/fffd82637dd54421a98bef9c8d8f0d50.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
