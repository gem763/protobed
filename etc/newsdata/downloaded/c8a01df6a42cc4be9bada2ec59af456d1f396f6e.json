Here is a new version of its lauded and successful console that strips out many of its key features. It's a Switch that can't Switch; so no being able to play it on the go and use it as a home console on the big TV.\n\nNo detachable Joy-Con controllers to snap off and hand to a pal. Some of its more idiosyncratic features like the infrared sensor? Gone.\n\nAnd yet a few days with this portable only version of the Switch and it all begins to make sense. Nintendo is firmly aware that, despite all its impressive mod-cons, the Switch has found its place in people\u2019s lives as a handheld device.\n\nIts game library is increasingly impressive \u2013 complete with brilliant first-party titles and a swathe of indie gems \u2013 while its full suite of controls has made it the most accomplished handheld games console yet. Even if that wasn\u2019t the original intention.\n\nNintendo no doubt have the empirical evidence to tell how much time has been spent with Switches connected to the TV and how long in handheld, but anecdotally it seems it would be considerably skewed to the latter.", "description": "Rarely a company to do the expected, the very concept of Nintendo\u2019s pared-down Switch Lite console may seem odd.", "authors": ["Tom Hoggins"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gaming/2019/09/25/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqbyhWdZ7MNLq5ObH4AkM2PhV6EZtZsi3pVrvadfLeoq0.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
