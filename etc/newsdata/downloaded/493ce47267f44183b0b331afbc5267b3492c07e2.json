By one account, Pentagon officials were \u201c in shock \u201d over Trump\u2019s willingness to share such information.\n\n\u201cWe never talk about subs!\u201d three officials told BuzzFeed News, referring to the military\u2019s belief that keeping submarines\u2019 movements secret is key to their mission.\n\nOf course, there are other security details \u201cwe never talk about,\u201d which the American president has a curious habit of just blurting out without any real caution or care. As the Washington Post explained:\n\nTrump was asked about the security of [American nuclear weapons in Turkey], now that Turkey has gone against U.S. wishes by invading northern Syria after Trump ordered a withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region. He didn\u2019t explicitly confirm the weapons were there, but he went along with the premise, saying \u201cwe\u2019re confident\u201d they\u2019ll be safe \u201cand we have a great air base there \u2013 a very powerful air base.\u201d U.S. government officials have long avoided disclosing or even confirming widely believed locations of U.S. nuclear weapons.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as Rachel noted on the show last night, Trump, during public White House comments yesterday, also appeared to give out the exact number of U.S. special forces currently stationed in the northern Syria border region, which has become a new conflict zone thanks to the president\u2019s disastrous new policy decision.\n\nTo be sure, there have been some news accounts with similar estimates on the number of American troops in the area, but there\u2019s a qualitative difference when the Commander in Chief publicly confirms those reports in specific detail for no reason.\n\nAll of which brings us back to a familiar concern: does Donald Trump know how to handle sensitive information responsibly?\n\nAs regular readers know, a discouraging answer is tough to avoid. Indeed, yesterday\u2019s developments come just six weeks after the president published a tweet about a failed Iranian launch, which included a detailed photo. As MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell reported, it wasn\u2019t long before observers started wondering whether Trump had publicly released classified material.\n\nThis comes up far more often than it should. It was, after all, just four months into Trump\u2019s presidency that he welcomed Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergei Kislyak into the Oval Office \u2013 at the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 for a visit that was never fully explained.\n\nIt was in this meeting that Trump revealed highly classified information to his Russian guests for no apparent reason. The Washington Post reported at the time, \u201cThe information the president relayed had been provided by a U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government, officials said.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal added, \u201cAccording to one U.S. official, the information shared was highly sensitive and difficult to acquire and was considered extraordinarily valuable.\u201d\n\nIn a normal White House, this story would\u2019ve been an enormous scandal that haunted the president for the rest of his term, but in the Trump era, it was soon eclipsed by a dozen other evolving controversies. Nevertheless, the leak happened, and the public has never received an explanation for why the president did what he did.\n\nThe incident came on the heels of a gathering in which Trump discussed sensitive details about North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile tests with the prime minister of Japan at a Mar-a-Lago dining area, in view of wealthy civilians/customers.\n\nLess than a year later, Trump ignored the pleas of many U.S. officials and recklessly declassified information in the hopes of advancing a partisan scheme. All the while, the president refused to give up his unsecured smart phones, which create additional security risks.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, let\u2019s not forget that this problem would likely be even worse were it not for some intervention from officials who know better. During a photo-op at an event along the U.S./Mexico border last month, the president seemed eager to boast to reporters about technological advancements in border security. It fell to Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, the acting head of the Army Corps, to interject, \u201cSir, there could be some merit in not discussing that.\u201d\n\nSoon after, we learned that during calls with world leaders, then-White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, on multiple occasions, found it necessary to mute the line so that he could caution Trump \u201cagainst continuing to talk about sensitive subjects.\u201d\n\nDidn\u2019t Trump spend a year and a half on the campaign trail in 2016 complaining about Hillary Clinton being careless with sensitive intelligence?\n\nAbout a month after Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. intelligence officials were worried about the new president\u2019s \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d and \u201cdiscretion.\u201d\n\nThose officials were right to be concerned.", "description": "Donald Trump is amazingly incapable of being cautious and discrete when discussing sensitive security information in public.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_msnbc_trump_newser_turkey_191016_1920x1080.jpg?itok=VqEpMQqB", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
