It seeks to force Mr Trump's accountants with Mazars USA to hand over those documents.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

He is also seeking to block the release of his financial documents in the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, in Manhattan, where a state grand jury in New York City had issued a separate subpoena.\n\nIt may be difficult for Mr Trump to convince the Supreme Court to take up his case, according to former US solicitor general Neal Katyal, who in that capacity previously represented the federal government before that panel. Mr Katyal reasoned that it would be difficult since the appeals court and a respected federal judge had already ruled against the president.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
