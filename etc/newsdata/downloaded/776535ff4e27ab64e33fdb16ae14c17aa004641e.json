The parcels for lease are about five to 20 miles (eight to 32 kilometers) north of the monument.\n\nThe sale comes amid an ongoing debate over drilling in states like Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico, where a coalition of tribes are calling for a halt on energy development near land that Native Americans consider sacred.\n\nThe Trump administration has pushed to open vast expanses of public lands to oil and gas drilling, speed up the construction of petroleum pipelines and ease federal environmental regulations, dismissing calls from scientists in and out of government that immediate cuts in oil, gas and coal emissions are required to stave off the worst of climate change.\n\nThe plan was met with criticism from environmentalists and tribal organizations, who argued drilling on the high desert would damage the prehistoric structures and pollute the air.\n\n\u201cWhen this oil and gas leasing happens on or near sacred lands, it risks de-stabilizing the bedrock (of the structures),\u201d said Ahjani Yepa, a member of Utah Din\u00e9 Bik\u00e9yah, a Navajo grass-roots organization. \u201cHovenweep is in all of our stories, and to threaten the integrity of these structures jeopardizes everything we\u2019ve carried forward as resilient people.\u201d\n\nAdventure_Photo via Getty Images Ruins at Hovenweep National Monument are seen at sunset in this undated Getty file photo.\n\nEnvironmentalists and local business owners have also expressed concern over the impacts on water resources in rural communities and tourism from outdoor recreation that helps local economies.\n\nHovenweep was designated as an International Dark Sky Park in 2014 by the International Dark-Sky Association, recognized for its striking night skies and star-gazing opportunities. Southeast Utah is known for its sweeping desert landscapes and expansive night skies. The state has 11 internationally recognized \u201cDark Sky Parks,\u201d the most of any state.\n\nBusiness owners in Bluff said the dark skies drive tourism to Hovenweep, and feared industrial light pollution, as well as the sounds and smells of energy development, could drive visitors away.\n\nKathleen Sgamma of the oil industry trade group Western Energy Alliance countered that the plans are far from the boundaries of the monument.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re making sure companies are operating in a responsible way while meeting the call from Congress to expand oil and gas development,\u201d she said.\n\nKimberly Finch, a Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman, said every lease includes a cultural resource protection requirement that allows the agency to modify plans if impacts to cultural resources can\u2019t be avoided or minimized.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, Finch said there were no results to share and the sale would continue until at least Tuesday.\n\nHovenweep is in all of our stories, and to threaten the integrity of these structures jeopardizes everything we\u2019ve carried forward as resilient people.\n\nThe agency says in planning documents that companies should take steps to protect the environmental and cultural landscape of the area, including limiting the use of artificial light at drilling sites and protecting useable groundwater aquifers from drilling.\n\nCompanies must obtain permits and go through environmental reviews before they begin construction or drilling. Some leases go years before drilling or expire before any activity occurs.\n\nStill, environmentalists and Native Americans invested in the land said such documents fail to address a larger trend of leasing increasingly more land on or near sensitive tribal landscapes. Parcels near Hovenweep were offered, then deferred, in a March BLM lease sale, and new documents for an upcoming December lease sale show more land will be up for grabs.\n\nJuana Charlie, a member of the Pueblo of Acoma, said it\u2019s been difficult to negotiate with the BLM on cultural protections.\n\n\u201cAt least we have our little foot in the door, but that\u2019s as far as we\u2019ve gotten,\u201d she said. \u201cThey argue these lands are abandoned, but they\u2019re not, we use them in our prayers, we visit them. You wouldn\u2019t like it if I went into your home, your land, and started digging.\u201d\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management would benefit from more community outreach and long-term planning to lease parcels on sensitive landscapes, said Erika Pollard, an associate director with the National Parks Conservation Association. But the new \u201cenergy-dominated era\u201d she said we\u2019re in has made public input on these processes harder.\n\n\u201cWhen you drive by Hovenweep, it feels like you\u2019re travelling back in time. Having that landscape dotted with oil rigs and factories changes everything,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to think, \u2018what legacy do we want to leave in Utah?\u2019\u201d", "description": "Numerous indigenous groups consider Hovenweep National Monument and its prehistoric structures to be sacred.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d77deed2300001005512b23.jpeg?cache=p7vz17zebj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
