It kept the interest rate steady. The move took traders by surprise as the authorities usually inject liquidity when previously offered loans come due, and the next batch won\u2019t mature until Nov. 5.\n\nThe Chinese economy has been under pressure amid a prolonged trade dispute with the U.S. and a slowing domestic economy, prompting the central bank to ease monetary policy by lowering corporate borrowing costs and cutting banks\u2019 reserve ratios this year. Data released this week showed that China\u2019s factory deflation deepened and imports and exports fell last month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not expected by the market,\u201d said Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered (LON: ) Plc., referring to the cash injection. \u201cThey probably want to inject more long-term liquidity\u201d to ensure ample supply during the tax payment season in mid-October and to support the economy, which is still facing growth pressure, she said.\n\n\u201cMarket reaction is muted, however, probably as the rate is kept unchanged\u201d while other central banks are cutting interest rates, according to Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac Banking Corp.\n\nThe yield on China\u2019s 10-year government bonds fell 1 basis point to 3.16% as of 10:34 a.m. in Shanghai.", "description": "China Unexpectedly Injects $28 Billion of Cash as Growth Slows", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picee9164e799f4c105cb87986e353ad14e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
