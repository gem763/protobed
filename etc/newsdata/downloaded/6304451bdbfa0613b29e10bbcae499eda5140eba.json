It is a horrific weapon, and has been used repeatedly during the Syrian civil war; unfortunately its use has become increasingly normalised.\u201d\n\nWhite phosphorus is routinely held by militaries around the world and is used legally in combat as a smoke screen in daytime and as an incendiary to light up an area at night. But it is illegal to use it against civilians, because it causes serious and exceptionally painful burns on contact with skin.\n\nKurdish officials accused Turkey of using \u201cunconventional weapons\u201d in the conflict on Thursday \u2013 a few hours before the US-brokered ceasefire was announced \u2013 and called international inspectors to examine the injured.\n\nA member of the Rojava diplomacy office on Friday said it had documented a number of suspicious cases restated calls for international organisations to investigate.\n\nTurkey said the accusations were false. Hulusi Akar, the defence minister, said: \u201cIt is a fact known by everyone that there are no chemical weapons in the inventory of the Turkish armed forces\u201d.\n\nThe incident is alleged to have taken place in or around the border town of Ras al-Ayn but are few confrmed details as to what had happened and whether civilians were deliberately targeted. White phosphorus is most commonly used to tip artillery shells, whose fire can often be inaccurate.\n\nThe OPCW said it had \u201cnot yet determined the credibility of these allegations\u201d and that the chemicals weapons inspectorate would continue to monitor the situation.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Turkey and the US announced a 120-hour ceasefire to allow Kurdish forces to withdraw 20 miles from the 300-miles border with Turkey, although some fighting on the border is continuing.", "description": "Kurdish medics says at least six people in hospital with burns from \u2018unknown weapons\u2019", "authors": ["Dan Sabbagh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5db80d32074a72d78579a2bdd6009b79e803459/0_299_3518_2110/master/3518.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ed8d62fc8fc050e859b9bb9972a89af8", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
