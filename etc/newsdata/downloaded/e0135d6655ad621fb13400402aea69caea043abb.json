But well-intentioned as they may be, it\u2019s not clear that the proposals are targeting the source of the problem, or what kind of public health benefits they\u2019ll have in the future.\n\n\u201cI think the best regulations are those that are informed by science. That isn\u2019t the case here,\u201d says Thomas Eissenberg, co-director of the Center for the Study of Tobacco Products at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\n\u201cthe best regulations are those that are informed by science. That isn\u2019t the case here.\u201d\n\nBans on flavored e-cigarettes were the first to take hold: Michigan announced a ban in early September, though it hasn\u2019t gone into effect, and New York state passed an immediate ban on all flavors but tobacco and menthol this week. Lawmakers in Washington, DC also proposed a flavored e-cigarette ban this week, while internationally, India announced a complete ban on all e-cigarettes. Those bans didn\u2019t come out of nowhere \u2014 organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics have long called for bans on flavored products. Items featuring sweet flavors are particularly attractive to adolescents and teenagers, and are thought to have contributed to the dramatic increase in e-cigarette and nicotine use in that age group. However, the flavors aren\u2019t thought to be the cause of respiratory problems.\n\n\u201cHopefully, this will decrease the number of adolescents and young adults vaping,\u201d says Laura Crotty Alexander, an associate professor of medicine studying e-cigarettes at the University of California at San Diego. \u201cBut does it have anything to do with vaping illnesses sweeping the nation? Nope.\u201d\n\n\u201cdoes it have anything to do with vaping illnesses sweeping the nation? Nope.\u201d\n\nMany of the reported illnesses \u2014 but not all \u2014 have appeared in people using bootleg and illicit vaporizer pods containing THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana. However, the illnesses and flavors are being conflated in conversations around legislation, says Michael Siegel, professor of community health sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health. \u201cEither they\u2019re conflating them unknowingly, or they\u2019re taking advantage of this outbreak to get policies passed that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to,\u201d he says.\n\nSiegel thinks California\u2019s proposed e-cigarette policies, which direct regulators to crack down on counterfeit and illicit products, is more likely to prevent illnesses. \u201cIf you want to get to the bottom of the outbreak, you have to figure out how to stem the tide of illicit products on the market,\u201d he says.\n\nBut because it\u2019s still not clear what, exactly, is causing the illnesses, blocking black market or counterfeit products specifically still isn\u2019t guaranteed to have an impact, Crotty Alexander says. Investigators are struggling to pin down a main culprit \u2014 a specific chemical or additive related to the illness. It\u2019s very possible that more than one product is contributing to the outbreak, Crotty Alexander notes \u2014 people using e-cigarettes or vapes came down with respiratory illnesses before this current outbreak, so different cases could have been caused by different ingredients. That said, researchers are still on the lookout for what\u2019s caused this particular rise in cases.\n\n\u201cthey can see the difference between a background slow burn and a spike.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of the surge right now, it seems likely that a fair number of these cases are due to one thing in particular. The CDC has a lot of experience in these outbreak type situations \u2014they can see the difference between a background slow burn and a spike. This is a spike,\u201d Crotty Alexander says. \u201cIt suggests a different chemical has entered the market, or that a certain brand or e-liquid is more popular right now compared with a year ago.\u201d But that brand isn\u2019t necessarily a counterfeit product: vaping liquids, even those sold by major companies, contain thousands of chemicals, most of which haven\u2019t been tested for safety. For that reason, she says, you could argue that there isn\u2019t much difference between products considered counterfeit and those sold by companies.\n\nIf the illnesses are stemming from additives or chemicals also found in regular vaping products, cracking down on counterfeit or unregulated products would only help in the short term, Eissenberg says. \u201cIf, in the long term, the normal nicotine liquids also cause these illnesses, then we still have a problem.\u201d\n\nWhile public health investigators continue to search for the source \u2014 or sources \u2014 of the illness that has sickened 530 people, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people \u201cconsider refraining from using e-cigarette or vaping products.\u201d\n\nRegulators making decisions around vaping now are doing so with only limited information about the products and their health effects, because the research is still in early stages, Eissenberg says. \u201cWe need to jump-start the research necessary to guide regulation in the future,\u201d he says. \u201cI think a valuable side effect of a very unfortunate cluster of disease is that more attention and resources will be put behind the work.\u201d", "description": "As the number of respiratory illnesses linked to e-cigarettes continues to rise, lawmakers and governors in states across the country are pushing for regulations on the products \u2014 including bans on flavors and increased oversight of counterfeit cartridges.
