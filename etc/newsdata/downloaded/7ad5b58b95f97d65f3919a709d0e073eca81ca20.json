After a fairytale wedding in an Edinburgh castle, they moved into married quarters where PTSD slowly infiltrated daily life. \u201cIf tea towels weren\u2019t in rows, or the coffee and sugar weren\u2019t lined up he\u2019d get really, really angry.\u201d Trips out were ruined by what she now knows to be the symptom of hyper-vigilance. \u201cEvery time we even went to the park with the kids he would be constantly risk assessing, registering every person and whether they\u2019ve got a rucksack, then changing our route if he saw the same person twice.\u2019\u2019\n\nThat night he had the worst night terror. He was screaming, he was sweating. I tried to wake him and got punched in the face.\n\nThe crisis point came years later after his closest military friend tried to take his own life. \u201cThat night he had the worst night terror,\u201d 'Becky' remembers, \u201che was screaming, he was sweating. I tried to wake him and got punched in the face. Even though this experience was frightening, it gave me confidence to stand up to him and say no you can\u2019t argue with this symptom.\u201d\n\nBut confronting her husband about the severity of his PTSD backfired. \u201cHow dare I suggest he was so weak he would suffer from mental illness? Have I got no respect for him at all? To him that was like saying he\u2019s not a soldier. That\u2019s his identity, and how dare I try and take that away?\" Becky says he was so disgusted with her suggestion he needed help, \u201che left the house and went on a two to three week binge-drinking downward spiral, and broke every marriage vow we ever took together.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely time. None of her friends understood the effect PTSD was having on her husband\u2019s behaviour. \u201cA lifelong friend called me up and said, \u2018I never had you down as one of those pathetic women that supports their husbands doing all sorts\u2019.\u201d\n\nPressure from family and military friends eventually brought him home to admit he needed help. But by this point, Becky was suffering too. In a survey of UK partners living with treatment-seeking veterans, 17% presented with symptoms of secondary PTSD themselves and over a third reported problems with anxiety and depression. (Source: Journal of Epidemiology and Public Health Reviews 2016)\n\n\u201cI was sick with stress, angry and isolated. I couldn\u2019t even have a cry as it made his PTSD worse. Living with someone who is suicidal isn\u2019t easy, especially when you have children. I was hyper-vigilant myself at home, making sure no medicines were left around, always risk-assessing.\u201d\n\nWhen 'Becky' went on the Combat Stress programme for partners, not only did she find people who understood, but she was given help that she says has changed her life. She was advised to go home and talk to her husband about his suicide plan, and make sure a phone call to her became part of his preparations. \u201cOnce he agreed to this, the stress just left. I can go out and have a cup of tea with my mum or watch my daughter\u2019s assembly and not be terrified I\u2019m going to come back and find him dead on the floor.\u201d\n\nEvidence suggests that only a minority of partners seek support for themselves as there are still many barriers, including carer responsibilities and judgement from others.\n\n'Elaine', 59, hoped that retirement would bring travel and new adventures. But this all changed in 2015 when her breast cancer diagnosis triggered her husband\u2019s PTSD, 28 years after he\u2019d left military service.\n\n\u201cHe was so determined to look after me and he did an amazing job getting me to all my appointments, but I could see his mental health suffering. It was the hardest time in our lives.\u201d Later when her husband started expressing thoughts about wanting to hurt her, he was hospitalised for four weeks. 'Elaine' struggled with depression, anxiety and isolation. She still remembers the reaction from her closest friend. \u201cShe asked me if I\u2019d have known back then what I know now, would I still have married him? In a heart-beat I said 'yes'. PTSD is an illness. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d have asked my husband \u2013 if he\u2019d known I\u2019d get cancer, would he still have married me?\u201d\n\nAll three interviews feature in our new three part series about the partners of veterans suffering with PTSD.
