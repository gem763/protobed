The hero, Killian Scott as detective Rob Reilly, dreams of wolves, wakes at night with agonising cramps and suffers flashbacks to soft-focus summer days spent riding his bike with friends.\n\nIt\u2019s so Stephen King, you almost expect a clown to emerge from the nearest drain with a knife.\n\nDublin Murders: Cassie Maddox played by Sarah Greene and detective Rob Reilly played by Killian Scott\n\nOne hour in, the show\u2019s biggest strength is the intriguing relationship between Reilly and his murder squad partner, Cassie Maddox (Sarah Greene). They are tender but never physical, not lovers but evidently old friends who trust each other implicitly. It\u2019s almost as if they are brother and sister.\n\nThey share sandwiches and ciggies at the sea\u2019s edge to celebrate solving another case, thanks to their telepathic understanding in the interview room.\n\nAt one moment, Maddox counts down in her head to the moment Reilly\u2019s gentle questions will make the suspect break and confess. Reilly\u2019s real identity, and his connection to the murder in the woods, may become clearer in the second episode tonight.\n\nDisruption of the night Twice in four days, ITV\u2019s schedules were tossed aside, with Corrie and Emmerdale moved to give way to England football matches \u2014 even for Scottish viewers. Why are soap fans treated so cavalierly?\n\nThe drama is based on two novels by American-Irish writer Tara French, In The Woods and The Likeness, adapted by Sarah Phelps \u2014 the screenwriter behind several top-notch Christmas Agatha Christies, including And Then There Were None.\n\nPhelps has a literary turn of phrase, to which Reilly gives full rein in his philosophical musings about death. It\u2019s strange, then, that the series has been saddled with such a mundane title.\n\nDublin Murders is accurate but so unimaginative, it might as well be called the Ronseal Police Investigation Show, because it does exactly what it says on the tin.\n\nWhere\u2019s the poetry, where\u2019s the mystery? It\u2019s as though Silence Of The Lambs was released as The Very Hungry Cannibal.\n\nThe story is set in 2006, when department chiefs could still get away, just about, with boorish comments about a female colleague\u2019s breasts and pass it off as humour. It\u2019s surprising how dated the attitudes of the Noughties already look.\n\nEd Balls\u2019s dockside economic predictions are going to look very dated next month, if Britain does leave the EU and the sky doesn\u2019t fall in. The final part of What Britain Buys And Sells In A Day (BBC2) was packed with shots of the former Shadow Chancellor looking gloomy as he contemplated the disruption to our imports and exports.\n\nCo-presenter Cherry Healey on a crab fishing boat in BBC2's What Britain Buys and Sells\n\nDear oh dear, his expression said in every shot. Woe is me. Lackaday, and don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. Eeyore Ed couldn\u2019t dampen the spirits of co-presenter Cherry Healey, who visited the Norton motorcycle works in Leicestershire to discover how a British buy-out rescued the brand 11 years ago and now exports these classic bikes all over the world.\n\nThat\u2019s the spirit. Ade Adepitan was having fun, too, riding in Ferraris and top-of-the-range Teslas as he learned how batteries are replacing petrol tanks.\n\nMeanwhile, Ed was learning to steer a supertanker, using a model the size of a canoe on a duckpond. Oh no, he reversed it into the quayside. What a calamity. And then he scraped it down the other side. Everything was going to be ruined.\n\nEd hung his head. It was all a disaster, just like he said it would be.
