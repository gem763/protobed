Asked whether he really was someone who regularly interrupted interviewees, he replied: \"Of course I am. Well, I'm an arguer. I love arguing.\"\n\nHis colleagues recalled an occasion when he destroyed the last typewriter in the office. \"There is a bit of a myth about me throwing it out of the window. There may have been a little small incident involving it, but I did not throw it out of the window.\"\n\nThe 76-year-old will continue to present Mastermind on BBC Two.\n\nHe is Today's longest-serving presenter and has been one of the corporation's highest earners.

An early morning three-minute interview with correspondent Andrew Gilligan in 2003 led to a confrontation between the BBC and the government. Gilligan said he had been told by a reliable source that a government dossier about the threat from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction had been deliberately \"sexed up\". This ultimately led to the suicide of the source, Dr David Kelly, and the resignations of Gilligan, the BBC director general and the BBC chairman.\n\nin 2003 led to a confrontation between the BBC and the government.

It followed the resignation of Carrie Gracie as BBC China editor over pay inequality. In what Humphrys described as a \"jokey\" exchange, he asked Sopel about \"how much of your salary you are prepared to hand over to Carrie Gracie to keep her\".\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
