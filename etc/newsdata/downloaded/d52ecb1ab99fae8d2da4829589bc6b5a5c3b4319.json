The network is calling on politicians to bring in a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d to cut Birtain\u2019s emissions to zero and improve lives, changes to education to equip children to deal with the climate crisis and votes at 16 to give them a voice.\n\nAmong the many trade unions throwing their weight behind the strikes are the TUC Congress, the University and College Union and Unite.\n\nGlobal warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels has already led to droughts and heatwaves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods, scientists say.\n\nCarbon emissions climbed a record high last year, despite a warning from the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October that output of the gases must be slashed over the next 12 years to stabilise the climate.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Millions of people around the world are taking to the streets\u00a0in what could be the largest climate change protest in history.
