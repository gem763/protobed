Surely, this must be the thing. And it wasn\u2019t the thing,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing: there\u2019s a new thing, and it might be the thing.\u201d\n\nThat thing \u2013 the one pre-empting the formal impeachment inquiry \u2013 is a snowballing scandal involving phone calls Trump made to the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Last week, it was reported that worrying \u201cpromises\u201d Trump made in one phone call prompted an intelligence official to file a whistleblower complaint. Since then, numerous outlets have revealed that Trump allegedly pressured the Zelenskiy to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden \u2013 the frontrunner to take on Trump in the 2020 election \u2013 and used American military aid to the country as leverage.\n\nSeth Meyers on Trump: 'If this isn\u2019t impeachable behavior, I don\u2019t know what is' Read more\n\n\u201cNo wonder Pelosi is launching an impeachment investigation \u2013 this makes Watergate look like Nixon tried to pass an expired coupon at the Kroger,\u201d Colbert said.\n\nA fun fact about this scandal, \u201cif the end of democracy sounds like fun to you\u201d, said Colbert, is that the phone call in question occurred on 25 July \u2013 one day after the special counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress about his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cSo the idea that a foreign power like Russia shouldn\u2019t interfere in our elections is the only thing everyone agreed on,\u201d Colbert explained. \u201cEveryone but Trump, because he just moved one country over.\u201d\n\n\u201cHello, Ukraine?\u201d Colbert said, mimicking Trump\u2019s voice. \u201cYou up? For interfering in our elections?\u201d\n\nTrevor Noah\n\n\u201cIf you thought Trump was unhinged before, I can\u2019t even imagine what he\u2019s going to be like now,\u201d said The Daily Show\u2019s Trevor Noah on the impeachment inquiry. \u201cYou better keep your kids away from Twitter people, because this thing is gonna be a category 5 tweetstorm \u2013 and this one will hit Alabama.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) Trump may have invited a foreign government to meddle in a U.S. election. No, not that one, the next one. pic.twitter.com/mrEpF0Mz5F\n\nNoah recapped the bizarre story of the Ukrainian phone call, the whistleblower and perhaps most damningly, the $250m of military aid to Ukraine that Trump inexplicably delayed.\n\nIf true, the withheld aid \u201cwould be devastating\u201d, said Noah. \u201cIt\u2019s an abuse of power, it\u2019s extortion and, maybe worst of all, it\u2019s asking a foreign country to meddle in America\u2019s election. Which is the one thing that if you\u2019re Donald Trump, you should stay away from.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration, Noah remembered, had just gotten over the Mueller investigation into Russia election interference. Immediately seeking help from Ukraine \u201cwould be like if the day after Michael Jackson got acquitted for touching kids, he was like: \u2018Let\u2019s celebrate! Slumber party at my house!\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump, of course, has either denied or deflected the accusations with a line of defense Noah characterized as \u201che ain\u2019t done shit\u201d, along with unsubstantiated allegations against Biden and corrupt ties to Ukraine.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to support Trump\u2019s accusation against Biden, Noah said, \u201cbut even if it did, Trump abused the power of his office to try to dig up dirt on a political opponent\u201d.\n\nJimmy Kimmel\n\nTuesday was \u201ca major news day in the history of the United States\u201d, said Jimmy Kimmel from Los Angeles on Tuesday night. Pelosi\u2019s announcement on the impeachment inquiry was especially notable because she had been resisting the calls to impeach for so long, but \u201conce again, Donald Trump is doing what he does best: forcing a woman to do something she didn\u2019t want to do\u201d, said Kimmel.\n\n\u201cI guess he feels like nothing can stop him now,\u201d Kimmel said after recapping the week of revelations that rolled into impending impeachment. \u201cHe got away with Russia and the election, and it makes perfect sense he would ask Ukraine to help him with the next one.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of drama, Kimmel said, all because Trump is \u201cdumb \u2026 he gets on the phone and he can\u2019t resist saying stupid stuff\u201d.\n\nKimmel then reminisced on when Trump once tweeted, in 2014: \u201cAre you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re about to find out,\u201d Kimmel replied.", "description": "Late-night hosts break down a remarkable day in Washington: Pelosi\u2019s announcement of impeachment inquiry into Trump", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5afd966de09a4795e3c6f9eefb8316af43d9f003/39_0_1567_940/master/1567.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e0dd2c005530b9d02b622d40ceda6de9", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
