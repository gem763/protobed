One was by beauty salon Queen of Aesthetics advertising the \u2018Kylie Jenner Package\u2019 consisting of lip, cheek and jawline fillers. The other for fillers was Faces by AKJ Aesthetics, which included an image of Jenner.\n\nBeauty Boutique Aesthetics did not respond to the ASA\u2019s enquiries. Queen of Aesthetics told the ASA \u201cit had not posted any ad that told their customers they could make them resemble Kylie Jenner, adding that it would be \u2018almost impossible\u2019 for a customer to look like anyone other than themselves after a non-surgical cosmetic procedure.\u201d\n\nFaces by AKJ Aesthetics said to the ASA \u201cit used Ms Jenner's picture because she was recognisable to their target audience and showed the areas that could be treated, rather than to imply that their treatment could make consumers look like her.\u201d", "description": "Three ads were banned for misleading customers that they could look like Kim Kardashian or her sister Kylie Jenner.", "authors": ["Lianna Brinded", "Head Of Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KTyfxFJ1pf6B8cB5og9CqQ--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/2e421280-df5f-11e9-9b7f-2ba44aa16921", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
