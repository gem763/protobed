(See the video above.)\n\nOn \u201cLate Night\u201d Monday, the host corrected a tweet in which the president tried to diss former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, who announced he would run against Trump for the Republican nomination.\n\nReferring to an affair that Sanford had with a woman in Argentina while he was in office, Trump wrote that he was \u201cfound in Argentina with his Flaming Dancer friend.\u201d\n\nWrong on so many fronts. Perhaps Trump meant to spell \u201cflamingo,\u201d which would be incorrect because he was probably referring to the flamenco dance style. But that would also be inaccurate because Sanford\u2019s former mistress was apparently not a flamenco dancer, Meyers noted. Additionally, as HuffPost has pointed out previously, \u201cArgentina is known for tango dancing \u2015 not flamenco.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a seven-layer dip of presidential insanity,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cStupid stacked on top of stupid stacked on top of stupid and then, I guess, guacamole?\u201d\n\nWatch the full segment above or fast forward to :55 for the Twitter takedown.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nSeth Meyers Shreds The Donald Trump Word Error You Might Have Missed\n\nLate Night TV Hosts Shred Donald Trump\u2019s Bizarre Hurricane Dorian Claims\n\nSeth Meyers Pinpoints 'Damning' Moment Donald Trump Gave Himself Away On \u2018Sharpiegate\u2019\n\nLove HuffPost?
