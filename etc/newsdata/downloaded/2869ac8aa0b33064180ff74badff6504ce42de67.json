And, you know, the White House said in 2014 that there was no issue with Hunter having that job,\" Bedingfield said.\n\n\"But, you know, and I think that asking this question is exactly, Alisyn, what Donald Trump wants, right? There\u2019s no evidence, as you stipulated at the top, which is important, there\u2019s no evidence that he did anything wrong, and yet he still hopes that you guys will ask questions like that, that you will try to insinuate that there was an optical issue, that there was some kind of, you know, that there\u2019s some kind of issue there that wasn\u2019t there.\" she continued. \"This is exactly the playbook that he ran in 2016. We\u2019re not going to let him do it this time.\"\n\nWhen Biden had stern words for a Fox News reporter when he asked him about the issue, Bedingfield encouraged reporters to instead, \"ASK. THE. RIGHT. QUESTION.\"\n\nTrump and his allies maintain there was conflict of interest since Hunter joined the board of Burisma Holdings in 2014, while his father was vice president, and was paid $50,000 per month to attend board meetings and energy forums. They also accuse Biden of trying to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired when he had an open case against Burisma Holdings. Many news outlets had reported there is no proof of that charge.\n\nTrump's July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about the Biden family while also discussing military aid has supercharged Democrats call for impeachment, with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi endorsing opening an inquiry into impeachment last week.\n\n", "description": ".09/30/2019 20:05:51PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/273/7ac6a696-3110-42be-8bc9-5d673ed5e9d5.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
