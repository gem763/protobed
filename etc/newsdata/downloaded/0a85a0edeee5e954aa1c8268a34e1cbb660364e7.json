When these dust particles are breathed in, they can cause respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.\n\nDuring a speech at a conference earlier this year, Thailand's prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, floated the idea of completely moving the capital as a way to dramatically reduce traffic and overcrowding.\n\nEarlier this year, Indonesian officials announced they were preparing to move the nation's capital from Jakarta to Borneo in large part because of rising sea levels.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nDense clouds of dangerous toxic smog suffocated Bangkok's air on Monday, forcing residents to seek shelter inside and wear special masks.\n\nThe thick smog \u2014 which is caused by a mix of ultra fine dust particles emitted from vehicles and construction sites and high humidity levels \u2014 has grown so bad in recent years that some of the nation's highest officials are considering moving the capital entirely.\n\nThe dust particles, which are known by the identifier PM2.5, are thin enough to enter a person's bloodstream if they breathe them in. Once inside the body, the pollutants can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.\n\nThe Thailand government has set the bar for \"safe\" levels of PM2.5 at 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air. On Monday, PM2.5 levels soared to 79 micrograms, The Seattle Times reported.\n\nThailand's government is considering moving the capital\n\nA worker rides an elevator in smog a smog filled Bangkok on Monday.

Chan-o-cha ordered government agencies to ramp up their anti-pollution efforts and simultaneously instructed private manufacturing and construction companies to reduce their output in a desperate attempt to quickly bring pollution levels down.\n\nEven with these concentrated efforts, dangerous levels of smog are expected to continue hovering around the Thai capital for the next few days.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, one Bangkok resident described a harrowing scene of residents walking into work coughing violently, with blood running from their nostrils.\n\n\"A lot of my friends are saying they come to the office, their noses are running,\" Bangkok officer worker Piyavathara Natthadana told ABC. \"All of them are really coughing today. It's not normal anymore.\"\n\nMassive overcrowding, traffic congestion, and lackluster regulations have all played a major role in Bangkok's pollution woes, leading some major officials, including prime minister Chan-o-cha, to float the idea of moving the capital entirely. Chan-o-cha hinted at the possible relocation effort during an address to the World Conference earlier this month.\n\n\"The first is to find a city that's neither too far nor too expensive to move to,\" Chan-o-cha said. \"The second is to move to outer Bangkok to reduce crowding.\"\n\nThe prime minister stressed that more research is needed before the government officially decides to move to the outskirts of Bangkok but said it's possible such a move could happen under his administration.\n\nIndonesia moved its capital because it's sinking into the sea\n\nIf Bangkok were to move the capital, it would do so one the heels of similar initiatives being implemented by Indonesia. In that case, Indonesia has planned to move its capital from Jakarta to Borneo due in large part to the fact that the former capital city, which is home to 10 million people, is sinking.\n\nBangkok residents were told to remain inside and wear special smog masks on Monday.
