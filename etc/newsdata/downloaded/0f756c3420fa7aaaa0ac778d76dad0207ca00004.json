It plays a role in deciding what news is, and is not, covered, and also in deciding how that news is covered. In this instance, the Post's \u2018reporters\u2019 are guilty of both,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIn a statement to The Hill, The Washington Post defended its reporting.\n\n\"Our story prominently noted the White House\u2019s list of accomplishments and quoted a White House spokesman at length. It also reported the views of Republicans, both on the record and on background, some of whom are part of the administration and some who watch its performance from a distance,\" said Shani George, the Post's director of communications.\n\n\"Readers can judge for themselves whether our account fairly represented a variety of perspectives on the President\u2019s summer,\" she added.\n\nTrump often attacks the Post for what he views as unfair coverage, frequently calling it the \u201cAmazon Washington Post\u201d in reference to the paper\u2019s owner, Jeff Bezos Jeffrey (Jeff) Preston BezosWhite House officials attack Washington Post over 'media bias' White House swipes at Washington Post in official video celebrating Trump's 'winning' Trump lashes out at the media, Democrats in Labor Day tweets MORE, who is the founder and CEO of Amazon.\n\nThe White House opinion piece also attacked the Post over its own \u201cembarrassing moments,\u201d pointing for instance to a freelance article that had to be corrected for 15 errors.\n\nThe White House op-ed \u2014 titled \u201cThe Washington Post\u2019s lost summer,\u201d to mimic the publication\u2019s original article describing Trump\u2019s summer \u2014 was published Thursday and promoted by the White House Friday morning.\n\nGrisham and Gidley also called out The New York Times and cable news networks in the op-ed for what the administration officials described as biased news coverage. Trump regularly refers to reports by the Times, CNN and other outlets as \"fake news.\"\n\nThe White House earlier this week mocked the Post\u2019s \u201clost summer\u201d article on Twitter, sharing a video that branded the piece \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n--Updated at 12:27 p.m.", "description": "The White House is ramping up its attacks on The Washington Post for what it\u00a0calls unfair coverage of President Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/grishamgidley.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
