And, to you, as the descendants of those killed, I offer my every sympathy, for I understand the pain does not diminish with time.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Captain Cook's legacy is disputed in modern times\n\nCampaigners say the damage inflicted by the British colonisation continues even now, with Maori communities suffering higher levels of deprivation.\n\nIn a statement on its Facebook page, the Rongowhakaata Iwi Trust welcomed the British expression of regret.\n\nBut it recalled that the crew had opened fire almost as soon as they landed, killing the local chief and others.\n\n\"After only being here for two hours, Cook and his crew had trespassed, terrorised, killed and stolen from us.\"\n\nOther Maori rights advocates have been critical of the low-key ceremony, which stopped short of an apology.\n\nMany have described as insensitive this weekend's anniversary events marking Captain Cook's arrival, which are expected to attract protests.\n\nThey see him as an invader whose explorations, which helped chart the Pacific Ocean, also led to colonialism and traditional communities being destroyed.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In 2016 a UK museum handed back a Maori skull\n\nThe UK has offered expressions of regret for actions that happened during colonial times in only a few instances.\n\nIn May then Prime Minister Theresa May described the 1919 Amritsar massacre as a \"shameful scar\" on Britain's history in India. Hundreds of people were shot dead by troops.\n\nMany in India and elsewhere had pressed for a full apology, which was not forthcoming.", "description": "The statement comes ahead of the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook's landing in New Zealand.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E60E/production/_108849885_gettyimages-145208691-594x594.jpg"}
