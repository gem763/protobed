In November, when she was a ninth grader, Thunberg staged a strike for two weeks outside the Swedish parliament, demanding that the government cut emissions by 15% a year.\n\nNow Thunberg spends every Friday on strike.\n\nIn December, Thunberg made headlines by accusing a group of assembled leaders from nearly 200 countries of \"behaving like children.\"\n\nThunberg will make her voice heard again on Saturday at the United Nations Youth Climate Summit in New York City, then speak at the UN Climate Action Summit on Monday. To get to these events, she chose to sail across the Atlantic on a zero-emissions boat, rather than rely on emissions-heavy aviation.\n\nRead More: Here's what 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg's zero-emissions journey from Europe to New York looked like.\n\nHere's how Thunberg rose to prominence as the face of a new movement in a single year.", "description": "Greta Thunberg has met with world leaders, led climate strikes, sailed across the Atlantic, and been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.", "authors": ["Aylin Woodward", "Ivan De Luce"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d839bd52e22af27545dc919-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
