The offensive has displaced at least 130,000 people.\n\nTurkey\u2019s president signaled that it was ready to launch an assault on the city of Manbij, where Kurdish-led groups invited Syrian government forces to re-enter and defend the town.\n\n\u201cWe are about to implement our decision on Manbij,\u201d President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters on Monday.\n\nHe added that Turkey\u2019s aim would be to return the city to Arab populations whom he said where its rightful owners.\n\nTurkish forces were already positioned at the city\u2019s edge, according to CNN-Turk.\n\nErdogan has already said Turkey will not negotiate with the Syrian Kurdish fighters, which it considers \u201cterrorists\u201d for links to a long-running Kurdish insurgency within its own borders.\n\nSyrian state media reported late Sunday that government troops were marching toward Manbij \u2014 as well as the border town of Kobani that in 2015 witnessed the Islamic State group\u2019s first defeat in a battle by U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters.\n\nIn another direction, Syrian troops moved east from Aleppo province to Raqqa where state media said they had reached Ein Issa. Heavy fighting the previous day there reached a Kurdish-run displaced-person camp that is home to some 12,000 people, including around 1,000 wives and widows of IS fighters and their children. Hundreds are believed to escaped amid the chaos.\n\nThe Syrian army also moved into the town of Tal Tamr, which is about 12 miles from the Turkish border, and Tabqa, known for its dam on the Euphrates River and its nearby air base that carries the same name.\n\nSANA said government forces planned to \u201cconfront the Turkish aggression,\u201d without giving further details. Photos posted by SANA showed several vehicles and a small number of troops in Tal Tamr.\n\nTal Tamr is a predominantly Assyrian Christian town that was once held by IS before it was retaken by Kurdish-led forces. Many Syrian Christians, who make up about 10 percent of Syria\u2019s pre-war population of 23 million, left for Europe over the past 20 years, with the flight gathering speed since the country\u2019s conflict began in March 2011.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c8/fb/d2d08a1747f6bea5666b7fc0f5cb/20191013-turkey-building-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
