(Picture: Eric Smith/ File photo)\n\nA pet owner has was left heartbroken after an alligator mauled his much-loved dog to death.\n\nEric Smith, 55, told Metro US that his 15-year-old Italian greyhound Abby was killed by the cold-blooded reptile last week in Big Pine Key, Florida.\n\nSmith, who lives with husband Aaron Stultz, 44, said he was home from work and let his dogs out in his backyard, but Abby disappeared through a hole she found in the couple\u2019s fence.\n\nHe searched for Abby for three hours \u2013 only to find her body in floating a canal two lots away from his house with the alligator believed to have killed her lurking nearby.\n\nSmith said: \u2018It looked like (the alligator) broke her neck, broke her jaw and like really gouged her neck. You know, her jugular vein was bleeding when I found her.\u2019\n\nSmith said the fatal alligator attack on Abby (left) has left him terrified to let his other dogs out in his backyard. (Picture: Eric Smith)\n\n\u2018I think, initially, she was done in two seconds,\u2019 he continued, adding that the alligator swam off when he arrived, but stayed in the area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith called the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), and he removed Abby\u2019s corpse from the canal before the alligator returned to the body to do any further damage. Animal officials later arrived to trap and remove the alligator.\n\nMuslim woman denied entry to nightclub after refusing to remove hijab\n\n\u2018Immediately I knew\u2026 there was no chance I\u2019m taking her to the vet, to help her and revive her. But at the same moment, the (alligator) was there and he dipped under the water and swam off. I don\u2019t know, it was an indescribable feeling,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018It was a little bit of shock, disbelief, and also relief.\u2019 Smith explained that it would have been worse if the gator had taken Abby to eat her and left him wondering if she was still alive but lost and hungry.\n\nHe continued: \u2018All I wanted to do was find her and understand what happened\u2026It\u2019s always not knowing that\u2019s the worst.\u2019\n\nSmith said he hopes to raise awareness about alligators in the canal near his home. (Picture: Google Maps)\n\n\u2018I found my dog at a place where the alligator took her to stash her for a while\u2026I truly believe I found my dog before (the alligator) had a chance to find her, before he came back to eat her,\u2019 Smith continued.\n\nSmith shared news of Abby\u2019s death this week in the hope of warning others of the potential threat posed by alligators in Big Pine Key.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have family come down here on vacation\u2026and their kids are jumping into the canal and swimming an this and that. You know, an awareness would be prudent,\u2019 he said.\n\nDriver let children as young as 11 drive school bus\n\n\u2018And if there are problem gators, then a community effort would help to identify where they are so (animal control) can come down and grab them.\u2019\n\nSmith said he has other dogs and Abby\u2019s death has left him afraid to let them out into his backyard.\n\n\u2018Right now, we\u2019re in fear everyday\u2026our next stop is to put a fencing along the sea wall so our dogs can\u2019t get close to the canal system.\u2019\n\nAlligators are currently categorized as threatened species in the Florida Keys.
