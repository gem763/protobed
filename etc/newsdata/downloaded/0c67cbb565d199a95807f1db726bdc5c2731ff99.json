How could anyone be such a brilliant pop songwriter, singer, screamer, and such a total punk-rock badass, and be so insanely cute at the same time? No one funnier or cooler.\u201d Brody Dalle-Homme wrote that she \u201cwas hugely underrated. Badass guitar player and great voice, really cool songs\u201d, while Damian Abraham of Fucked Up called her \u201cone of the all time great voices\u201d.", "description": "As well as her own band the Muffs, Shattuck also played with Pixies, Nofx and Bowling for Soup", "authors": ["Ben Beaumont-Thomas"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bda34a33978aeebae7c245c02545e272b9a0c592/131_445_2017_1209/master/2017.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9e9acfbd560cf43ae942d20e5d3c4254"}
