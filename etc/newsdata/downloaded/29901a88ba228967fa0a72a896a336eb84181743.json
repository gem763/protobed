(NTNX) , a cloud infrastructure company that has seen its shares fall from $53 to as low as $17 over the last 52 weeks as the company transitions to a subscription-business model.\n\nPandey said Nutanix is celebrating its 10th anniversary and is executing on its second major transition as a company. The first transition was from on-premise servers to servers in the cloud; the second transition is moving its business model to subscriptions. Subscriptions are important, Pandey said, because they allow customers to buy the infrastructure they need in a small, bite-size portions they can easily afford and scale.\n\nWhen asked about that transition, Pandey admitted the move is messy from an accounting perspective and makes comparisons difficult in the short term. But, he added, 71% of the company's business is now subscriptions and visibility will be improving.\n\nLet's see if anything is visible in the charts that can help us as investors.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of NTNX, below, we can that prices have slumped pretty hard since February. Two gaps to the downside get our attention in March and May. An upside gap in late August is showing us some promise of a turnaround. Prices are above the flat 50-day moving average line but still well below the declining 200-day line. The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a bearish trend from February to August and then some recent strength this month. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is above the zero line but poised to cross to the downside.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of NTNX, below, we can see that prices made a round trip from the 2017 lows. Prices are below the declining 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has been bearish since early 2018 and the MACD oscillator only recently gave a cover shorts buy signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of NTNX, below, we can see the price action without any gaps. A small downside price target is indicated.\n\nBottom line strategy: The charts of NTNX need to create a new base pattern if we are going to see a new rally develop. I would wait for a base to form before getting involved.", "description": "Nutanix Inc.
