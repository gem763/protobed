Another: a powerful and perennially criticized first daughter of the United States. The third: a woman both dubbed the \u201cnext Mrs. Astor,\u201d since then, and, commensurately, society\u2019s biggest \u201cresister.\u201d\n\nBut this was then.\n\nAs Tinsley Mortimer, Ivanka Trump, and Lauren Davis (now Lauren Santo Domingo) made their way, in turns, into the American Museum of Natural History\u2014all three co-chairs of its annual Winter Dance\u2014the night unfolded as so many junior charity-circuit events did in the marrow of the mid-aughts in the center of the world, while at the same time, now, providing a key-hole into the transmogrifications of socialite life since.\n\n\u201cThis is like the singles scene from hell! Everyone is just scoping each other out!\u201d Amy Poehler, not a regular on the circuit, was heard exclaiming then, according to Page Six later, as the then-SNL comic took in the rush of Pretty Young Things.\n\nWith a dress code calling for \u201ccelestial black tie,\u201d and a guest list reflective of the era\u2014OMG, there\u2019s an Olsen Twin! Oh, and that\u2019s Moby!\u2014it was also, like so many of history\u2019s social meridian points, only fully understood with the gift of hindsight.\n\nIt was a time post-Hilton, but pre-Kardashian. It was before hashtags, before Instagram, before \u201cinfluencers\u201d; before the society set\u2014like every set\u2014had fully turned into a public-private House of Mirrors.\n\nIvanka, then a Jared-less heiress\u2014though already trying to distinguish herself as a media-ready one\u2014was heard speaking in a way that, no doubt, already contrasted to the breathy voice that she uses in TV interviews (her offstage voice is an \u201coctave deeper,\u201d reports The Washington Post).\n\nBeing at the gala that night, I also distinctly remember seeing Tinsley and Lauren hitting the dance floor together, and going wild.\n\nFor the kissy-kissy crowd, at large, the night would culminate in the Hall of the Universe, where, as it happens, there\u2019s a \u201cStars Zone\u201d tracing the life and death of stars, in addition to a \u201cBlack Hole exhibit,\u201d the latter exploring a phenomenon so vast and so dense that nothing can escape its gravity.\n\nAhoy, metaphors.\n\n\u201cThey were changing into $6,000 frocks in the backs of cabs,\u201d recalls Ben Widdecombe, a gossip columnist for the New York Daily News at the time, summoning up the amped-up, post-Sex-and-the-City, pre-economic crash society tableau, to Town & Country.\n\nOf all of them, Tinsley was arguably the most promising. A Southern Belle-turned-Upper East Sider, she\u2019d managed the hat-trick of turning her marriage to an heir to the Standard Oil fortune and then being endlessly photographed at parties into her own bull-market\u2014a stock so high, she was called, varyingly, both \u201cthe next Paris Hilton\u201d and \u201cthe next Martha Stewart.\u201d\n\nFrom the prospective of 2018, in which Tinsley now occupies the same cultural terrain as NeNe Leakes and Erika Jayne\u2014Mortimer begins her sophomore season next week on the New York tent-pole in the Bravo Housewives-sphere\u2014it can be all too easy to forget precisely the sandbox in which she sat.\n\nShe\u2019d been honored with her own shade of Dior lipstick back then. She was a mainstay at the Met Gala. She hobnobbed with arbiters like Oscar de la Renta. She was \u201cbig\u201d in Japan, reported New York magazine.\n\nNotably, unlike many of today\u2019s \u201cHousewives\u201d who became tabloid fixtures, plus party invitees, only once they begin the process of appearing on TV, Tinsley is the only one of the 100 or so such ladies from all the franchises, past and present, who emphatically earned her way back into the limelight since doing the show. (She\u2019s a pioneer!)\n\nThe intertwining years? They have been much chronicled: There was the divorce from Topper Mortimer, which led to a winnowing of her society wattage in the manner of a classic Edith Wharton character, followed, most dramatically, by an acquisition of her own police mug shot, the consequence of being arrested for drunkenly trespassing on the property of her on/off sugar-heir boyfriend, Nico Fanjul, in Palm Beach.\n\nRHONY, as it\u2019s known\u2014oft considered the gold-standard of Housewives franchises\u2014brought her back to life!\n\nThe \u201cmug shot\u201d would gets its share of mileage on her first season on the show\u2014Tinsley smartly opting to bring it up herself before any of the other ladies could\u2014as would her bittersweet attempts to re-establish herself in the city in which she ruled as Queen Bee (a narrative expected to continue in the current season).\n\nIn some ways, it remains forever 2005, though exemplified by the aging debutante\u2019s refusal to change her hairstyle, despite the urging of many of her cast-mates. The Goldilocks ringlets are nonnegotiable, Tinsley essentially told them.\n\nIn some ways, however\u2014because this is the Trump Era, after all\u2014the tableau was very different, Tinsley\u2019s debut on the show coming just months after the father of her old pal, Ivanka, had been made president.\n\nIn an unorthodox move, RHONY actually veered into a plot-line encompassing the national election just held\u2014one focused mainly on cast regular and Hillary-die-hard Carole Radziwill\u2014but one from which Mortimer recused herself.\n\nIn fact, when pressed about her own political views in a follow-up with Jezebel, she dodged the question with all the footwork of a triple axel jump, putting it this way in an email: \u201cPolitics are fueled by a lot of passion, and for good reason. If someone is passionate about something, that is their choice.\u201d\n\nDuring the reunion that capped the season\u2014that rite of \u201cclosure\u201d that sees out every franchise\u2014the conversation came up, once again, when the always-incorrigible Andy Cohen specially grilled the ladies on their votes, and at least half of them wound up pleading the fifth.\n\nWhen it came to Mortimer, specifically, she played two different cards, saying she wasn\u2019t \u201cable to vote\u201d because she is still a Florida resident, and also adding that voting is \u201cnot my thing.\u201d\n\nThe interesting thing, though? Tinsley\u2019s M.O.\u2014a classical one in the long history of socialites who have traditionally been loath to wear their politics on their couture sleeves\u2014couldn\u2019t be more different from that of her old dance partner, Lauren Santo Domingo.\n\nShe\u2019s the one who, more than anyone, has bloomed into the number one anti-Trumpist in the creamy circles that once included Ivanka as a ranking member.\n\nAn agitator in Proenza Schouler, the Twitter feed of LSD (as she is frequently known) takes her war on Trump\u2019s Washington to her 100K followers.\n\nExhibit A: \u201cIn the end, it will be @realDonaldTrump and @IvankaTrump alone in the bunker.\u201d\n\nAnd then: \u201cLike his trophy wives he has trophy hires, @Omarosa, @KellyannePolls, @IvankaTrump,\u201d she also boomed, back in November. \u201cSmart honourable women need not apply.\u201d (Note the actual Twitter handles spelled out in the tweets! She wants her old friend to see them!)\n\nOn another occasion, when a story broke about the first daughter sitting in Putin\u2019s chair during a visit to the Kremlin, LSD quipped (about her erstwhile gala co-chair, ironically!): \u201cShe LOOOOOOVES to sit in important chairs. It\u2019s kinda her thing.\u201d\n\nIn her own intertwining years, the \u201cPoland Springs heiress,\u201d as she was once primarily known, had fully rocketed, it\u2019s safe to say, owing first to her much-ado wedding held in Cartagena, Colombia, to the extraordinarily-wealthy-in-his-own-right Andr\u00e9s Santo Domingo, dubbed \u201cthe first real society wedding of the century\u201d (and during which Tinsley served as one of nine bridesmaids!).\n\nThere was also the span of her social reach (\u201cPick a high-profile charity event, and Santo Domingo has likely hosted, chaired, or sponsored it,\u201d New York magazine once exclaimed).\n\nA contributing editor at Vogue; the co-founder of the quite successful online-retailer Moda Operandi; the favorite of the \u201cTruman Capote of Instagram,\u201d as her BFF, Derek Blasberg has been crowned; inducted into Vanity Fair\u2019s International Best Dressed List... the dynamo has been everywhere, including on Gossip Girl, where she played herself.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s something all three women\u2014Tinsley, Ivanka, and Lauren\u2014share, all of them having appeared, at one point or another, on the ultimate, one-time rich-kid serial.\n\nThat might be the only thing they have in common these days.\n\nLauren also goes after Ivanka\u2019s husband for his adventures in nepotism, for example: \u201cHey Jared, how\u2019s that peace in the Middle East thing going?\u201d\n\nAt times, Lauren\u2019s tone has shifted into one that is pitiful, if not plainly melancholic. When Ivanka, during one interview, mused that her father\u2019s idea of arming teachers, in the wake of the Parkland massacre, might not be a bad idea, Santo Domingo struck this way: \u201cArming teacher is a terrible, no good, very bad idea. @Ivankatrump, what they done to you?\u201d\n\nIt was a question that managed to strike deep at the heart of the deep fissures in New York society since the election of an emphatically New York character to the presidency\u2014one that most New Yorkers did not vote for.\n\nWhat, indeed... Ivanka? It\u2019s hard to say where it goes from here for her. Raised as the girl who literally had a window-spanning view of Central Park from a 68th-floor bedroom\u2014the princess in the black and gold tower!\u2014and one who famously had Michael Jackson come to watch her perform in The Nutcracker one year, as revealed in the book Raising Trump, her personality, as I\u2019ve long seen it, was once a palatable composite of her dad\u2019s warrior ferocity, but also the savoir faire and Euro-ease of her mother, Ivana.\n\nBut while, before, the Wharton School graduate was able to lean mainly into her corporate-warrior, power-mommy, shoe-peddling-scion image\u2014when I interviewed her, in 2014, she ably talked about real estate, but also about how much, as a fledging cook, Jared likes her \u201cstews and steaks\u201d\u2014after the presidency run and win it\u2019s been a whole other trampoline act.\n\nWhile more world-famous than ever, she and her husband finds themselves on an \u201cisland\u201d, as various articles have described, a former pal in New York going as far as to tell Vanity Fair recently,\u201cNow their names are kind of their downfall.\u201d\n\nCan she come back? Who knows? But even just optically, it\u2019s hard to see.\n\nWhile Tinsley makes the most of it on TV these days, and Lauren continues to rule the roost, Ivanka\u2019s own \u201cbrand\u201d continues to be a question mark, at least within the genteel tribe with which she mixed.\n\nOh, the socialites: They zig, and they zag\u2014in our present media-saturated culture, more than ever, perhaps. But who would have predicted exactly how much since one particular dance, held under the stars, a mere 13 years ago?", "description": "In 2005, they were co-chairs of the American Museum of Natural History\u2019s Winter Dance.
