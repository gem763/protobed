As the capital city of the world\u2019s most-visited country, the choice of where to stay in Paris is mind-boggling, with thousands of accommodation options, from budget hostels to luxury hotels, and B&Bs to self-catering apartments.\n\nAs a France specialist, I\u2019ve stayed in hundreds of hotels across l\u2019Hexagone, but nothing quite compares to the je ne sais quoi of the kind of Parisian abodes which can, in themselves, become a highlight of any stay in the French capital.\n\nBut style doesn\u2019t have to mean breaking the bank; there are plenty of superb hotels offering great service, exquisite decor and a peaceful night\u2019s sleep without getting into debt. It\u2019s what we at The Independent call \u201creal-world luxury\u201d. So take a peek at these before your next trip to Paris.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Wonderfully discreet, it\u2019s reached via a secret corridor and has its own quiet courtyard and terraces.\n\nThe 50 rooms have been created by Parisian designer Doroth\u00e9e Meilichzon, and have handmade beds from Brittany with satiny, 300-threadcount sheets, while some rooms offer bathtubs big enough for two. There\u2019s also an Italian restaurant and a terrace cocktail bar with views of Paris. The best bit? Despite its buzzing central location, the bedrooms promise complete silence.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac200, room only\n\ngrandsboulevardshotel.com\u200b\n\nBest for cocktails: The Hoxton Paris\n\nThe newest addition to Paris\u2019 design hotel scene is a British export. The Hoxton Paris, which opened in summer 2017, brings with it superb Moroccan-inspired cocktails in Jacques\u2019 Bar. Decorated in florals and velvets, with full-height windows, it makes all-day cocktails a perfectly acceptable prospect.\n\nThe hotel itself is located in an 18th-century mansion, and is the biggest of the Hoxton hotel collection (currently in London, Amsterdam and Brooklyn). Spread over three buildings, it offers 172 bedrooms in four very British-named categories \u2013 Shoebox, Cosy, Roomy and Biggy \u2013 with decor featuring parquet floors, elegant cornicing, bold feature walls and geometric-tiled bathrooms. The standout design feature is its 15 elegant staircases, two of which are more than 300 years old. Elsewhere, the decor incorporates other features of the original building, such as tiles and mosaics, and exposed timber roof beams.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac99, B&B (there\u2019s a free light breakfast bag delivered to your room; for anything else, you have to pay)\n\nthehoxton.com\u200b\n\nBest for classic style: Pavillon des Lettres\n\nThis soothing hotel is a must-stay for book lovers: its elegant decor is dedicated to great works of literature. Each of its 26 rooms and suites is dedicated to a different letter in the alphabet and in turn a great scribe, from Hans Christian Andersen to Emile Zola.\n\nSome rooms offer views of the Eiffel Tower, but all feature calming neutral tones and hand-stencilled texts from the writers\u2019 great works. It\u2019s located in the 8th arrondissement, so is a short stroll from the Champs Elys\u00e9es.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac198, B&B\n\npavillondeslettres.com\u200b\n\nBest for history: L'Hotel\n\nLiterature lovers will delight in this bijou hotel, tucked away on the Left Bank. Once upon a time, it was a flea-bitten doss house where Oscar Wilde breathed his last breath, shortly after uttering the words \u201cThis wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death.\u201d\n\nNow, though, on the walls of that very same room (number 16), interiors guru Jacques Garcia has created a magnificent fresco of a gold and green peacock, while the rest of the room features historic prints and photos of Wilde, as well as the famous scribe\u2019s desk. Elsewhere, the tiny bar makes for a wonderfully cosy spot to be served a cocktail by the velvet-waistcoated bar staff. Dita Von Teese is a fan, and so \u2013 apparently \u2013 is Johnny Depp.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac298, B&B\n\nl-hotel.com\u200b\n\nBest for fun: Hotel 123 Sebastopol\n\nThe French love a theme and this fantastic movie-obsessed hotel is just a few metres from the famous cinema Le Grand Rex. Every detail is cleverly thought out, from its reception desk beneath an illuminated billboard to the cinema posters in the lobby.\n\nThe 63 bedrooms vary in style and have been designed by such cinematic glitterati as film-score composer Ennio Morricone and C\u00e9sar-award-winning actress Elsa Zylberstein. The minibars are stocked with complimentary soft drinks.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac114, B&B\n\nle123sebastopol.com\u200b\n\nBest for budget: Mama Shelter\n\nThe Mama Shelter brand launched in 2009 with this, their original hotel; since then the budget-style group has gone global, with branches in Hollywood and Rio de Janeiro as well as in key French cities. Prague and Belgrade are up next.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say it lacks that French vibe; as the original, this was designed by Philippe Starck, who gave his quirky Midas touch to the whole place. Meanwhile, many of the dishes on the menu in the laidback restaurant were created by another French legend, Michelin-star chef Guy Savoy.\n\nThe 172 bedrooms aren\u2019t enormous, especially the entry level ones, and they\u2019re deliberately designed to be cocoon-like with black and grey decor. But with mod cons such as a 27-inch iMac doubling as a TV, it\u2019s the perfect place to crash when the City of Lights has worn you out.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac79, room only\n\nmamashelter.com\n\nBest for luxury: The Saint James\n\nIf you\u2019re going to push the boat out with something a little different, then this slightly bonkers 49-room hotel, part of the Relaix & Ch\u00e2teaux group, is the place. Set in the elegant 16th arrondissement on a former airfield that was used to launch hot air balloons, this theme is carried through into the hotel\u2019s Wonderland-esque decor with rooms sporting bold toile wallpapers and lavish fabrics.\n\nElsewhere, it features a glamorous red-carpeted staircase and copious animal print. Meanwhile, two-Michelin-star chef Jean-Luc Rochas works magic in the chandelier-lit restaurant.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac380, room only\n\nsaint-james-paris.com\u200b\n\nFans of Christian Lacroix will love this four-star boutique hotel in the Marais; the fashion designer has brought his flamboyant style to the 17 rooms. All are decorated in a unique style, including polka-dot carpets and zebra-print fabrics, giving a nod to the history, culture and art of the area. On the doorstep there are a host of hip boutiques, as well as restaurants and bars (though the hotel\u2019s own bar is the ideal place to kick off your evening with an aperitif). Lacroix isn\u2019t the only celebrity to be linked to the property \u2013 the building was Paris\u2019 first bakery, and Victor Hugo used to buy his baguettes here.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac225, B&B\n\nhotelpetitmoulinparis.com\u200b\n\nBest for romance: Le Bourg Tibourg\n\nThis bijou four-star hotel in the hip Marais District is another of Jacques Garcia\u2019s works. This time, he\u2019s made what is a tiny space into something of an Aladdin\u2019s cave of decor. The place abounds with whimsical opulence: chandeliers, antique furniture, lavish fabrics and wallpapers all in deep reds, with accents of purple, green and grey.\n\nRooms are cosy, but it\u2019s a delight to snuggle into the comfortable beds and watch a classic French film (available from reception), complete with popcorn. Staff are welcoming without being overbearing, and the hotel is a hop, skip and jump from some of the Marais\u2019 best restaurants and bars.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac290, room only\n\nbourgtibourg.com\u200b\n\nNot many hotels can lay claim to their own ice bar but this is the main attraction at Kube, where you can sip vodka cocktails in glasses made of ice, in -10C temperatures. The theme doesn\u2019t end there; on arrival at the hotel you\u2019re welcomed into the reception, set in a large glass cube in the courtyard.\n\nFrom there, everything\u2019s designed to be modernist and fun. Its 40 open-plan, minimalist rooms offer all mod cons, including plasma TVs, CD and DVD players. The hotel is a short walk from Gare du Nord, so it\u2019s a great location if travelling with Eurostar.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac139, room only\n\nkubehotel-paris.com\u200b\n\nBest for nightlife: Grand Pigalle\n\nSet in the hip Pigalle district under the gaze of the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur basilica, Grand Pigalle was the first Paris hotel from the Experimental Cocktail Group (which have also just opened sister Hotel des Grands Boulevards, above) and makes the perfect base for those in search of Paris\u2019 coolest bars and restaurants. Rooms are cosy but offer swish decor from top designer Doroth\u00e9e Meilichzon in muted greys and teal tones, with geometric patterns in tiles and wallpapers. I particularly love the cocktail-glass carpet on the hallways and stairs and pineapple door knockers. Breakfast is served in the bar area and offers their delicious homemade granola.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac170, room only\n\ngrandpigalle.com\u200b\n\nBest for a local hangout: Le Pigalle\n\nOnce upon a time, the Pigalle district was a bit seedy \u2013 it\u2019s the home of the Moulin Rouge after all \u2013 but these days it\u2019s one of Paris\u2019 hippest quartiers that harks back to its heyday as a boho hangout for artists and musicians. The hotel itself celebrates all that is local: breakfast features croissants from the best local bakery, the cool bar has a soundtrack curated by a local DJ, and should you find yourself alone, there are plenty of books supplied by a local bookshop to peruse. Its 40 rooms are decked out with vintage furniture with a mid-century vibe and feature edgy photography and art works.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac101, room only\n\nlepigalle.paris\n\nBest for a sweet tooth: Hotel Fauchon\n\nParis\u2019 Fauchon boutiques are likely to inspire Willy Wonka-esque levels of mouth-watering awe, with their exquisite pastries, decadent chocolates and aromatic teas and coffees. Gourmets will be spoiled with a night or two at the new hotel, the first from the much-loved French patisserie brand, which was established in 1886. With the brand\u2019s accent colours of fuchsia pink, black and gold tastefully carried through the d\u00e9cor, the comfortable rooms all have mod cons, from tablet-controlled music and movies, to Bluetooth-linked speakers in the bathroom. The pi\u00e8ce de la resistance is the \"gourmet bar\": a souped-up mini-bar rammed with free champers, chocolates and other goodies. There\u2019s also a small spa and an excellent restaurant.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac650\n\nhotel-fauchon-paris.fr\n\nBest for interior d\u00e9cor: Brach Paris\n\nPhilippe Starck does a good hotel; the acclaimed French designer is responsible for the budget chic Mama Shelter, the palatial Le Meurice and dozens of other hotels worldwide \u2013 and his latest, Brach Paris, is a real treat. The moment you enter the glass fa\u00e7ade, dripping with jungle-like foliage, you\u2019re enveloped into a sumptuous space that blends Bauhaus, modernism and surrealism; warm wood panelling and plush carpets, gentle lighting and books everywhere lend an atmosphere that is hard to resist.\n\nBrach is set in the residential 16th arrondissement, and the hotel has spaces designed to welcome the well-heeled set: a sports club, swimming pool, and an enticing bar and restaurant. Ask to see the roof-top potager garden for its sensational views of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac410, room only\n\nbrachparis.com\n\nBest for classic luxury: Hotel Lutetia\n\nIn the early 20th century, the grand Hotel Lutetia on the Left Bank was the place to see and be seen, with stars such as Josephine Baker and Ernest Hemingway being frequent visitors. After a four-year renovation, during which architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte has sliced into the building to bring light into the once-dark areas, it has been given a new lease of life and an almost other-worldly feel. Polished walnut, white marble and a midnight blue and \u2018greige\u2019 (grey-meets-beige) colour scheme combine for an elegant yet modern effect, with occasional nods to the original art nouveau and art deco style. There is a spa, with a huge swimming pool, and the new Brasserie Lutetia \u2013 headed up by three-star Michelin chef Gerald Passedat \u2013 opens at the end of 2018.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac850, room only\n\nhotellutetia.com\n\nThis article has been updated.
