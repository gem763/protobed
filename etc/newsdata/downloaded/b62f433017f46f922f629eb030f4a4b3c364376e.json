Sportsmail had exclusively revealed the news on Wednesday morning.\n\n'We found out officially this morning but there were rumours flying around last night so we were glued to our phone last night,' Jones said.\n\nEddie Jones has spoken out after England's World Cup Pool C clash with France was called off\n\nTyphoon Hagibis is being put on par with a category 5 hurricane with 160mph winds expected\n\n'We didn't really care (when hearing the news). We were preparing for the game in game mode and now the game is off, we're in preparation mode. We can't control it.\n\n'We're told what to do. There's no use speculating on the alternatives. We're excited about having great preparation for the quarter-finals.\n\n'We'll have a short pre-season camp in Miyazaki and then we're off to Oita. We have an exceptional record in two-week preparations.'\n\nThe fixture would have taken place at Yokohama Stadium on Saturday evening, at around the time Hagibis is expected to hit the area, wreaking havoc.\n\nThe tropical storm is classified as 'violent' by Japanese meteorologists, with wind speeds likely to exceed 160mph.\n\nThe initial plan was to take the England v France fixture to Oita, in the southern island of Kyushu, where both teams will play their quarter-finals next week. However, logistical problems forced officials to abandon that option.\n\nEngland had been put through their paces on Wednesday morning with a training session\n\nOrganisers were considering moving the game from Yokohama due to Super Typhoon Hagibis\n\nJones had no objection to World Rugby's decision to cancel the match.\n\n'Of course everyone is disappointed. We wanted to play France and we put a lot of work into that. We have no issues, so we're getting on with it,' he said.\n\n'I've been walking around the streets and there are a lot of people with disappointed faces. It's difficult for the supporters and we're lucky to have great fans.'\n\nThe England coach now plans to use the two-week break between games to England's advantage.\n\n'We have the opportunity to build the tank up and empty it next week. A two-week preparation is the only chance we've got,' Jones said.\n\n'It's a wonderful World Cup but you can't help typhoons. We all like to think we have power but these things happen and we rise above it.\n\n'We'll do some light training Friday, have a hit out Saturday and then have a few beers.\n\nEngland currently top Pool C, and will stay there after they and France are awarded two points\n\nEngland will now qualify in top spot in their pool, and will likely face Australia in the last eight\n\n'We're not concerned, we're excited. Someone is smiling at us, the typhoon gods maybe.'\n\nEngland will now finish top of their pool but this is not an ideal scenario. They face going into a likely quarter-final against Australia in Oita a week on Saturday undercooked.\n\nEngland's last match became a procession against 14-man Argentina. It followed routine victories over Tonga and the USA, meaning the national team will not have been significantly tested before they take on the Wallabies.\n\nWorld Cup tournament director Alan Gilpin confirmed at World Rugby's press conference that the clash with France has been cancelled, along with New Zealand's match against Italy.\n\nGilpin said: 'After extensive evaluation of the weather information, we are confirming adjustments to the match schedule.\n\nWorld Cup tournament director Alan Gilpin confirmed the news at a press conference\n\nTV screens showed the path of the Super Typhoon as the tournament officials addressed issue\n\n'This includes the decision to cancel matches on safety grounds. Hagibis is predicted to be the biggest typhoon of 2019.'\n\nHe stated that each team involved in a cancelled gamed will receive two points.\n\nGilpin said World Rugby had no regrets staging the tournament in Japan during typhoon season.\n\n'We always knew there would be risks but it's rare for there to be a typhoon of this size at this stage of the year. We have no regrets,' he said.\n\nThe tournament director also went on to say that the integrity of the World Cup had not been compromised.\n\n'We don't believe so. There tournament rules are not new. We've never had to implement them before,' he said.\n\nSunday's games - including Scotland v Japan - remain under review.", "description": "England coach Eddie Jones has revealed that England will escape the dangers of Super Typhoon Hagibis by leaving Tokyo to return to their pre-World Cup training camp location in Miyazaki.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For Mailonline", "Press Association Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/06/19489670-0-image-a-5_1570685860398.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
