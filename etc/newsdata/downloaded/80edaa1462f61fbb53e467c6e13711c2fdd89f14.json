She started in the 1990s, when she was studying chemistry at Rice University. By 1997, she had moved home to Chicago to work at Charlie Trotter\u2019s. By 2011, she had won the James Beard award for outstanding wine service for her work at The Modern in New York.\n\nI met her back in early 2000s, when she was the dynamic new face of women in wine at the Fifth Floor in San Francisco and I was reporting about food for The San Francisco Chronicle. She\u2019s back in Chicago now, running a hospitality marketing business.\n\nWe both agree there have been significant changes since towering culinary figures like John Besh, Mario Batali and Ken Friedman fell after women told their stories about sexual harassment, abuse and assault.", "description": "The road to harassment-free restaurants may be long and bumpy, but customers can speed things along.", "authors": ["Kim Severson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/us/09-27-19-IHW-Restaurants/09-27-19-IHW-Restaurants-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
