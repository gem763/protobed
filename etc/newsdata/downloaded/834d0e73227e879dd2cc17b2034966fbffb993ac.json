'But a lot of people should be asking, perhaps. I have not asked it.'\n\n'I can't imagine that somebody isn't asking,' he said moments later.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he hasn't asked the U.S. Department of Justice to open a probe into Joe and Hunter Biden, who he has publicly accused of graft and corruption\n\nTrump has encouraged Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens' financial dealings in their countries dating back to the Obama administration, but he appears unenthusiastic about a domestic probe\n\nTrump and other Republicans have saddled Hunter Biden with allegations of graft and corruption stemming from a $1.5 billion Chinese investment deal and a lucrative seat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company called Burisma Holdings, which may have paid him as much as $2 million per year.\n\nThose perks, they say, came about because Joe Biden used the vice presidency as a recruiting tool for his son's business, and as a cudgel to stop criminal probes in their tracks.\n\nThe former vice president boasted last year that while he was in office he threatened to withhold $1 billion in American loan guarantees if Ukraine didn't fire its chief prosecutor \u2013 a reputedly corrupt official who was leading a criminal probe into Burisma.\n\nTrump on Friday heaped on the scorn, framing the Bidens as a corrupt father-son duo.\n\n'Hunter Biden walked away with a billion and a half dollars from China, $168,000 a month from Ukraine, supposedly a $3 million payment from Ukraine,' the president boomed over helicopter noise on the South Lawn of the White House.\n\nAnd continuing a theme he began during a Thursday night rally in Minnesota, the Trump marveled at Hunter Biden's ability to fly under the press corps' radar while controversy swirls around him.\n\n'I think Hunter Biden is a disgrace. You know, the number one t-shirt selling right now is \"Where's Hunter?\" I came up with that one last night,' Trump said.\n\nTrump said he wouldn't be surprised if someone were to press the DOJ for a Biden probe, but he hasn't done so\n\nDonald Trump raged against Joe and Hunter Biden during his campaign rally Thursday night in Minneapolis, calling Hunter a 'loser' and saying the former VP's main skill was understanding 'how to kiss Barack Obama's a**'\n\nThe Trump re-election campaign promptly started selling 'Where's Hunter?' t-shirts minutes after the president joked about it onstage in Minnesota.\n\nThe former vice president has said Hunter will eventually join him on the campaign trail.\n\nOn Thursday the president unleashed fury on both Bidens, saying Hunter is a 'loser' and Joe 'was only a good Vice President because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's a**.'\n\nDuring a freewheeling 102-minute speech, Trump mocked Hunter Biden for washing out of the armed services and having no practical experience in the energy industry.\n\n'Joe's son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and became a genius on Wall Street in two days,' he sniped. 'Whatever happened to Hunter, where the hell is he? Where is Hunter?'\n\nA black t-shirt with a white 'where's Hunter' logo is for sale for $25 on the Trump / Pence campaign website after the president mocked Hunter Biden for disappearing from public view while he is the subject of intensifying scandal\n\n'Hunter, you are a loser!' he yelled. 'What \u2013 you have $1.5 billion?'\n\nThe $1.5 billion appears to refer to investment capital that BHR, a Chinese equity firm where Hunter also sat on the board, secured following a father-son trip to China aboard Air Force Two in 2013.\n\nThe younger Biden held a 10 per cent stake in the fund.\n\nTrump also said Thursday that Joe Biden 'was never considered smart. He was never considered a good senator.'", "description": "Trump has encouraged two foreign countries to investigate the Bidens, citing his responsibility to encourage thorough  probes into official corruption no matter where hte bread crumbs lead.", "authors": ["David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/00/19611182-0-image-a-62_1570835031429.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
