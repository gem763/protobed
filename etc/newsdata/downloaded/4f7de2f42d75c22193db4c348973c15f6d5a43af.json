Once only available to a high-paying clientele, it has taken it's eight most popular, Instagram-worthy sets and opened them to the public for a limited time.\n\nTickets cost $29 per person, and kids under two years old are free.\n\nEach set displays different themes ranging from a vibrant upside-down yellow living room to a grayscale getaway motorcycle. Plus, each set is photo-ready, complete with themed props and professional LED lighting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 12 years and I always post them on Facebook and people are like, 'Oh my God, that\u2019s amazing. I want to be on that set,\u201d Ganun said.\n\nHe pulls design inspiration from artists and client requests.\n\n\"My inspiration usually comes from the client first. If they're having a Western-themed party or they want something space-aged, then that gives me a ballpark to play in. Then I start ripping off of that,\" Ganun said.\n\nDan Weber, CEO of The Scenario Studio and a co-founder, said that many popular Instagram influencers have frequented the pop-up since they first opened in early September. Since opening, the two most popular sets have been the upside-down set and the casino set, made famous at John Legend\u2019s Casino Royale themed birthday party.\n\n\"Sales have ramped up nicely as the word has spread,\" he said.\n\nThere's even a set ready for #SpookySeason!\n\nThey have everything you'll need to take the perfect picture, except the photographer, so make sure to bring a friend.\n\nYou will also want to consider Ganun's tips before visiting The Scenario Studio.\n\n\u201cLook good. How does your hair look? How does your clothing look?\" said Ganun. \"'Come a little dressed up,' I tell people. If you just show up in somewhat dark clothing that\u2019s flattering you\u2019re going to look good wherever you go in a picture. That\u2019s my advice.\"\n\nThe Scenario Studio will be at Grand Central Market in Downtown Los Angeles until Nov. 4 before moving to their new location on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. Their location in Beverly Hills is set to open mid-November and will showcase a combination of newly imagined sets and crowd favorites.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
