It's a blend of journalism and stand-up comedy that, in Minhaj's words, uses cutting-edge graphics that look \"like Michael Bay directed a PowerPoint presentation.\"\n\nMinhaj joined q guest host Ali Hassan to talk about how growing up brown and Muslim in America made him feel like both an insider and an outsider, and why he now sees that as his superpower.\n\nPatriot Act is currently in the midst of Volume 4. You can catch new episodes every Sunday on Netflix.\n\nDownload our podcast or click 'Listen' near the top of this page to hear the full conversation with Hasan Minhaj.\n\n\u2014 Produced by Ben Edwards", "description": "Hasan Minhaj has a secret weapon when it comes to comedy.
