But her claim to have been 74 has not been proven.\n\nMangayamma gave birth to two healthy baby girls on Thursday morning with her husband of 57 years, Raja Rao, 82, by her side.\n\nOldest mother in the world: Spanish woman who gave birth at 66 died in 2009 leaving orphaned twins Maria del Carmen Bousada de Lara gained worldwide notoriety when she gave birth to twins aged 66 in December 2006. The former shop worker, who was single, was branded 'selfish and irresponsible' by her own family over her decision to conceive so late in life. She admitted lying about her age in order to receive fertility treatment at a private clinic in Los Angeles, for which she paid a reported \u00a330,000 Maria returned to Barcelona where she delivered her sons by caesarean section. She claimed to be feeling healthier than ever and predicted that she would see her children live into adulthood and eventually become a grandmother herself. She told reporters at the time she believed she would live past 100 as she had 'longevity in her family'. But she died in July 2009 from cancer, having been diagnosed a year after giving birth.\n\nIt is believed the Ahalya IVF clinic in Guntur city paid for most of the procedure as medics knew it would be an historic achievement.\n\nMangayamma has no other children and went through the menopause 30 years ago.\n\nShe said at the time: 'I cannot express my feeling in words. These babies complete me. My six decade-long wait has finally come to an end. Now, no one call me infertile anymore.\n\n'I thought about taking help of IVF procedure after a neighbour conceived at the age of 55.'\n\nBritain's oldest mother is Elizabeth Adeney, from Lindgate in Suffolk, who gave birth to a son in May 2009 at the age of 66.\n\nThe NHS normally only offers the procedure to women under 43. But some private clinics will offer IVF to women over that age.\n\nWhen a woman goes through the menopause she is no longer able to get pregnant naturally.\n\nBut IVF is still possible through the use of eggs frozen earlier in the mother's life, or eggs from a donor.\n\nThe new mother will not be able to breastfeed the babies as her body has stopped producing milk.\n\nThe current record holder of the world's oldest mother, Bousada de Lara, was 66 years and 358 days old when she gave birth to twin baby boys, Christian and Pau, in December 2006.\n\nShe admitted lying about her age in order to receive fertility treatment at a private clinic in Los Angeles, for which she paid a reported \u00a330,000\n\nThe babies were delivered prematurely by Caesarean section and weighed 3.5 lbs (1.6kg) each.\n\nPREGNANCY AFTER 35: WHAT ARE THE RISKS? An increasing number of women are choosing to have babies later in life. While most go on to have healthy babies, there are a number of risks involved in getting pregnant above the age of 35. It might take longer to get pregnant - You're born with a limited number of eggs. As you reach your mid- to late 30s, your eggs decrease in quantity and quality. Also, older women's eggs aren't fertilized as easily as younger women's eggs. If you are older than age 35 and haven't been able to conceive for six months, consider asking your health care provider for advice. You're more likely to have a multiple pregnancy - The chance of having twins increases with age due to hormonal changes that could cause the release of multiple eggs at the same time. The use of IVF also can play a role. You're more likely to develop gestational diabetes - This type of diabetes, which occurs only during pregnancy, is more common as women get older. Tight control of blood sugar through diet and physical activity is essential. Sometimes medication is needed, too. Left untreated, gestational diabetes can cause a baby to grow significantly larger than average \u2014 which increases the risk of injuries during delivery. Gestational diabetes can also increase the risk of premature birth, high blood pressure during pregnancy, and complications to your infant after delivery. You're more likely to develop high blood pressure during pregnancy - Research suggests high blood pressure that develops during pregnancy is more common in older women. Your health care provider will carefully monitor your blood pressure and your baby's growth and development. You will need more frequent obstetric appointments and you might need to deliver before your due date to avoid complications. You're more likely to have a low birth weight baby and a premature birth. Premature babies, especially those born earliest, often have complicated medical problems. You might need a C-section - Older mothers have a higher risk of pregnancy-related complications that might lead to a C-section delivery. An example of a complication is a condition in which the placenta blocks the cervix (placenta previa). The risk of chromosome abnormalities is higher - Babies born to older mothers have a higher risk of certain chromosome problems, such as Down syndrome. The risk of pregnancy loss is higher - The risk of pregnancy loss \u2014 by miscarriage and stillbirth \u2014 increases as you get older, perhaps due to pre-existing medical conditions or fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Research suggests that the decrease in the quality of your eggs, combined with an increased risk of chronic medical conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes, could increase your risk of miscarriage. Ask your health care provider about monitoring your baby's well-being during the last weeks of pregnancy.
