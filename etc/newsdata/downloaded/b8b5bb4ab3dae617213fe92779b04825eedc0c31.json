(That\u2019s why two dozen GOP congressmen stormed into yesterday\u2019s secure hearing after denouncing it as a \u201cSoviet-style process.\u201d)\n\nThey can argue, as the president did, that this is a political \u201clynching\u201d (and amid the uproar, Joe Biden said he was sorry for using the same word about the 1998 Clinton impeachment).\n\nMEDIA, DEMOCRATS WORRIED ABOUT BEATING TRUMP, PINING FOR A SAVIOR\n\nThey can argue, as former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker did with Laura Ingraham, that \u201cabuse of power is not a crime.\u201d\n\nThey can argue, as Mick Mulvaney did with Chris Wallace, that politics has always influenced foreign policy.\n\nWhat they can\u2019t say, at this point, is that nothing happened.\n\nThe account by William Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, made that impossible.\n\nBefore we dive into the details, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, in her \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d statement, called the effort \u201ca coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution.\u201d\n\nBut this particular bureaucrat was retired and reluctant to take the job that Mike Pompeo offered a few months ago. Taylor fought with the 101st Airborne in Vietnam and did stints in Iraq and Afghanistan overseeing reconstruction aid. He has worked for presidents of both parties since Ronald Reagan. George W. Bush made him ambassador to Ukraine 13 years ago. At 72, he had capped a classic career as a foreign service officer.\n\nAnd we don\u2019t have to rely on Democrats describing what Taylor said, as we have his 14-page opening statement.\n\nWhat made it so effective is that he recalled standing on one side of a damaged bridge in Ukraine last July, looking at \u201carmed and hostile\u201d Russian-backed separatists and concluding, as Washington held up the military aid, that \u201cmore Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without U.S. assistance.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWith those words, as the New York Times put it, Taylor made clear that \u201cthe Ukraine scandal also extends to matters of life and death, as well as geopolitics on a grand scale.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaylor was most worried about the betrayal of a desperate ally at the hands of an American president,\u201d said the Washington Post.\n\nTaylor told the House he encountered an \u201cirregular\u201d channel on Ukraine, guided by Rudy Giuliani, that produced \u201ca weird combination of encouraging, confusing, and ultimately alarming circumstances.\u201d Taylor is the guy in those text messages who described the administration\u2019s handling of Ukraine\u2019s request for a presidential-level meeting with Trump as \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nHe testified that an OMB official said on a White House conference call, a week before the famous Trump-Zelensky phone conversation, that she could not release the aid to Kiev based on orders that went \u201cfrom the president to the chief of staff to OMB.\u201d\n\n\u201cI and others sat in astonishment,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThe Ukrainians were fighting the Russians and counted on not only the training and weapons, but also the assurance of U.S. support\u2026In an instant, I realized that one of the key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s true, as White House defenders note, that Taylor didn\u2019t describe a first-hand encounter with Trump, but it\u2019s clear from his testimony who was driving this train.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nThe president, on Twitter, quoted a Fox interview in which Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe said, \u201cNeither he (Taylor) or any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. You can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo.\u201d\n\nOn that point, the AP reported yesterday that Ukrainian president Zelensky spent a three-hour meeting with advisers back in May talking about how to navigate Giuliani\u2019s insistence on an investigation of American political matters and how to avoid becoming entangled in the 2020 elections.\n\nThere is, to be sure, plenty to argue about here, from the details of all the closed-door testimony to whether any of this has the gravity for a third presidential impeachment process in the last four and a half decades. But trashing Bill Taylor, who administration officials recruited to replace the ambassador they fired, makes no sense at all.", "description": "There are numerous arguments that President Trump and his allies can make against impeachment.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/23/694940094001_6097164816001_6097153234001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
