Harold \"Pie\" Keller was one of the men in the photograph, a development that comes 74 years after the Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph was taken on Mount Suribachi by Joe Rosenthal, an Associated Press photographer.\n\nOriginally, the man identified on the far side of the flag pole was Pfc. Rene A. Gagnon \u2013 a miscalculation caused, in part, by his helmet only being visible in the shot.\n\nAfter private historians identified by NBC News as Stephen Foley, Dustin Spence and Brent Westemeyer \"asserted that there was an error in identifying the Marines depicted,\" per a statement from the Marine Corps, the Marine Corps formed a board with assistance from the FBI to investigate the identity of the man photographed.\n\n\"Without the initiative and contributions of both private historians devoted to preservation of our history and the FBI\u2019s support, the Marine Corps would not have this opportunity to expand on the historical record of the second flag raising on Mount Suribachi,\" wrote the Marine Corps in a statement. \"We are extremely grateful for their dedication to helping us preserve our legacy.\"\n\nThe correction comes more than three years after the Marine Corps announced that they had misidentified Pfc. Harold Schultz, a Purple Heart recipient who went on to work for the U.S. Postal Service after being injured on Iwo Jima.\n\nLike Schultz, Keller was private about his time in World War II.\n\n\u201cWe knew he fought in the war, we knew he was wounded in the shoulder at one point,\" Keller's daughter, Kay Maurer, told NBC News. \"But he didn\u2019t tell us he helped raise the flag on Mount Suribachi.\u201d\n\nRegardless of who was memorialized in Rosenthal's photograph, the Marine Corps said in a statement that \"each and every Marine who set foot on Iwo Jima, or supported the effort from the sea and air around the island is, and always will be, a part of our Corps\u2019 cherished history.\"\n\nKeller, a Purple Heart awardee, died in 1979 at 57. According to his obituary, he was a former fire chief and for three decades was a member of the fire department in his hometown of Brooklyn, Iowa.\n\nHe is buried in Brooklyn Memorial Cemetery.\n\nFollow Joshua Bote and Adrianna Rodriguezon Twitter: @joshua_bote and @AdriannaUSAT\n\nIn this Feb 23, 1945 file photo, U.S. Marines of the 28th Regiment, 5th Division, raise the American flag atop Mount Suribachi, Iwo Jima, Japan.
