And the work\u2026 feels at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful location,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said 80 percent of revenues from the copyright of the work will go to the victims\u2019 families and the remaining 20 percent will go to the city for maintenance of the sculpture.\n\nKoons, seen as the king of kitsch contemporary art, told Le Figaro earlier this week he was \u201csaddened\u201d by the row, which he claimed was triggered by \u201ca lot of misunderstandings and misinformation\u201d.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 A controversial work by American pop artist Jeff Koons, aiming to symbolise US solidarity with France in the wake of the 2015 jihadist", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/83f9af_jeff-koons-created-monumental-work-asked-up-symbolise-us-solidarity-france-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
