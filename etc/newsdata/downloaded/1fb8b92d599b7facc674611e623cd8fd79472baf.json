However, President Trump\u2019s strong desire to address prescription drug costs before the 2020 election is a potential wild card that could affect its fate.\n\nIn a tweet Thursday evening, Trump indicated he supported Pelosi\u2019s bill. \u201cThe American people need Congress to help. I like Sen. Grassley\u2019s drug pricing bill very much, and it\u2019s great to see Speaker Pelosi\u2019s bill today. Let\u2019s get it done in a bipartisan way!\u201d\n\nEven if there is no deal with the White House, the Democrats\u2019 bill is a baseline for future efforts to address prescription drug costs under a Democratic president and Senate.\n\nThe measure would require the Health and Human Services secretary to negotiate the prices of up to 250 drugs in Medicare that do not have competitors and would impose severe financial penalties on drug companies that failed to come to an agreement. The negotiated prices would be available to all purchasers, not just Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nIt would also cap seniors\u2019 out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year. And it would require drug companies that have raised their prices above the inflation rate since 2016 to either lower their prices or rebate the portion back to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nBut there were already signs of division among Democrats as the party\u2019s progressive flank expressed concern the legislation did not negotiate prices on enough drugs.\n\n\u201cWe still are watching a few things. You can have everything great in the world, but if you have a few handfuls of drugs negotiated then it\u2019s not going to look the same to the public as something more substantive,\u201d Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), co-chair of the congressional Progressive Caucus, said Wednesday.\n\nCongressional Republicans expressed unanimity in their opposition to the measure. All 24 of the House Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s Republicans issued a joint statement criticizing the measure.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi is back at it \u2014 pushing a socialist proposal to appease her most extreme members,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the Senate\u2019s no. 2 Republican, called the bill \u201creally bad policy\u201d and said it was \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in the Senate.\n\nNonetheless, Pelosi said Thursday she believed her proposal could gain White House support. Her office has been in conversations with White House advisers for several months about drug pricing legislation.\n\n\u201cMy conversations with the president have been about making this a priority,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cI think we can have their cooperation.\u201d\n\nTrump has backed a more moderate drug pricing bill that was rolled out by the Senate Finance Committee in July, which also faces opposition from many Republicans.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and White House domestic policy director Joe Grogan met with a group of moderate House Democrats last week to discuss drug pricing measures, according to a lobbyist briefed on the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to share details. They told the group the White House is open to Medicare drug price negotiations but supported measures that could pass the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThe House Democrats\u2019 legislation proposes establishing a maximum price on negotiated drugs, based on an average of the typically lower prices paid by six other countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom. Those countries directly negotiate prices with manufacturers, which are almost always lower than the prices paid by Americans.\n\nThe Trump administration has its own proposal that would base the price of some Medicare drugs on an average of the lower prices paid by other countries.\n\nSome of the House proposal\u2019s provisions are similar to elements of a bipartisan Senate Finance Committee drug pricing package, which is backed by the White House but opposed by a significant number of Senate Republicans.\n\nThe Senate bill would cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors using Medicare\u2019s prescription drug benefit, called Part D, at $3,100 a year starting in 2022, while limiting drug price increases to the rate of inflation. Drugmakers that raise their prices faster than the rate of inflation would have to pay a rebate to the federal government.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates the Senate bill would save the federal government $100 billion over 10 years. Yet that bill faces steep hurdles: A majority of the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s Republicans opposed it in a committee vote, although it still passed. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not said whether he will bring it to the floor for a vote.\n\nRead more\n\nSenate releases bipartisan proposal to lower seniors\u2019 drug prices\n\nTrump kills key drug price proposal he once embraced", "description": "Congressional Republicans pan the measure, but Trump tweets \u2018it\u2019s great to see Speaker Pelosi\u2019s bill\u2019", "authors": ["Yasmeen Abutaleb", "National Reporter Focusing On Health Policy", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "September At Pm", "Yasmeen Abutaleb Joined The Washington Post In As A National Reporter Covering Health Policy", "With A Focus On The Department Of Health", "Human Services", "Health Policy On Capitol Hill", "Health Care In Politics.
