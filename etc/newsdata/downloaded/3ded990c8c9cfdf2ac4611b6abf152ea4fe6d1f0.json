On Oct. 5, he tweeted:\n\n\u201cRipple\u2019s relationship to XRP is akin [to] Chevron\u2019s relationship to oil. We have a lot of it, we believe it\u2019s a superior technology and we support its many uses \u2014 for billions of reasons. But we don\u2019t have all of it, we don\u2019t control it and we aren\u2019t it.\u201d\n\nBeyond the sarcasm of Carter\u2019s response \u2014 \u201cI miss those good ol XRP wildcatting days!\u201d \u2014 he also posted a link to a fall 2018 article by attorney Preston Byrne, which he deems to be the definitive take on the matter.\n\nA battle over history\n\nByrne\u2019s article traces the history of the Ripple network, Ripple Labs and XRP\u2019s creation by examining documents such as the founders\u2019 agreement and incorporation records. Analyzing the papers, Byrne argued:\n\n\u201cNo \u2018Official Ledger\u2019 containing XRP or any transactions on the ledger which is today used as \u2018XRP\u2019 existed before Ripple Labs, Inc. (initially named Newcoin Inc.) was incorporated on 19 September 2012.\u201d\n\nThis argument directly contradicts an interview with Brad Garlinghouse highlighted by Carter, in which the CEO is cited as saying:\n\n\u201cOne really important distinction is, the XRP ledger existed before Ripple the company. Certainly we are an interested party in the success of the XRP ledger, for sure \u2014 we own a lot of XRP. But it\u2019s a little bit like saying, Exxon owns a lot of oil. That doesn\u2019t make oil a security.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph has previously reported, this week\u2019s Twitter altercation continues various long-standing controversies \u2014 some evolving into several different legal actions.\n\nThese pertain to Ripple\u2019s degree of alleged centralization, token handling, ownership (the firm is estimated to own 60% of XRP tokens), alleged price manipulation as well as whether or not a security classification applies to XRP.", "description": "Ripple Labs comes under renewed criticism for its allegedly misleading representations that it \u201cdiscovered\u201d \u2014 rather than created \u2014 the XRP token", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9kYjNlYTNiNDVlODVkNWMyNDU4MWY1ZmEzOWJhMGU0Yi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
