Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Tuesday explained why spending hours posing for selfies with supporters after rallies is one of the perks of her 2020 campaign.\n\nSome 20,000 people packed New York\u2019s Washington Square Park for Warren\u2019s rally on Monday. Afterward, she attended to a four-hour selfie line.\n\n\u201cYou know, the selfies are the most fun about this,\u201d Warren told \u201cThe Late Show\u201d host Stephen Colbert. \u201cAnd it truly is the case, because it means you get the person to person about this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means for every single person who stays in that line, and look, somebody waited four hours, the guy at the end,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut it\u2019s about power and saying, \u2018I get it, we got a Washington that\u2019s working great for the rich and the powerful, not working for much of anyone else, you came in here, you talked about how it\u2019s broken, you talked about how to fix it, and people who say I can do a piece of that, I\u2019m in this fight all the way and I got a selfie to prove it.\u2019 So that\u2019s where we are. And it\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nCheck out the interview here:\n\nColbert later asked Warren if her assertion at the rally \u2014 that \u201cwe can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in just because we\u2019re too scared to do anything else\u201d \u2014 was a \u201cveiled shot\u201d at her 2020 rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cNo, the way I see this, these really are scary times,\u201d Warren responded. \u201cIt\u2019s scary times because Donald Trump is truly a terrible president. Not just bad, terrible.\u201d\n\nRelated...\n\nDonald Trump Ripped As \u2018Crass\u2019 For Comments About Cokie Roberts\n\nDon Lemon: \u2018Democrats Got Played\u2019 By Corey Lewandowski\n\nJimmy Kimmel Suggests New Slogans For Cory Booker, Some Go Better Than Others\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
