She has had the G-tube for more than a decade.\n\nAlicia Jordan\n\nThe teen's entire life changed nearly five years ago when she picked up an old bicycle and taught herself to ride. She discovered that she could not only ride the bike but thrived riding it, finding it fueled her energy.\n\n\"I lived my life in a hospital bed,\" she said of her pre-cycling days. \"I\u2019m living my childhood now and I live every day like it\u2019s a gift.\"\n\nWhen Jordan's mom, Alicia Jordan, saw her daughter \"come out swinging\" on the bike, she sought out USA Cycling, the national governing body for bicycle racing, and got her daughter in a training program and under the care of expert dietitians.\n\n\"She morphed into this incredible athlete,\" said Alicia Jordan. \"[My husband and I] transferred our energy from keeping her alive to letting her live the best life possible.\"\n\nJordan has gone on to compete in more than two dozen cycling races, winning gold and silver medals and setting personal records along the way.\n\nThe same condition that for so long kept her bedridden is now an asset to Jordan as a competitive cyclist in a way that has astounded medical experts, according to Harbison.\n\n\"For her, there is some difference in the way her muscle metabolizes energy that allows her to do this, especially since one of her specialties is hill climbing,\" she said of Jordan. \"Exercise is her fuel, essentially, that allows her to be closer to normal.\"\n\n\"What it is about exercise that has woken her brain up, and how she thrives in it, is what\u2019s so curious to me,\" Harbison added. \"She\u2019s the only child I've seen who\u2019s had this extreme lethargy that was improved by exercise.\"\n\nAlicia Jordan\n\nJordan's life has changed off the bike, too. With her improved energy she has been able to attend school and is doing an internship at Kate Farms, the maker of the plant-based formula she now uses in her G-tube.\n\n\"I call cycling my mental sanity,\" she said. \"It\u2019s definitely helped me just be able to live my life and feel like a normal human being and has been a doorway to many paths.\"\n\nThe U.S. Anti-Doping Agency officially cleared Jordan to compete last spring at any level after ruling that her G-tube does not give her an advantage over athletes.\n\nThe Hillclimb Worlds will be Jordan's first world championship race -- her first of many, she hopes.\n\n\"I knew ever since I was 8 years old that I couldn\u2019t just have a 9-to-5 life and I wanted to change the world, even though I was sick,\" she said. \"I knew I wanted to do something great, but didn\u2019t know what it looked like until I found cycling.\"\n\n\"What I love about cycling is that it doesn\u2019t stick anyone in the box,\" Jordan added. \"You can do whatever you want and decide how fast you want to go and how far you want to go.\"", "description": "Hannah Jordan, 18, just started biking about five years ago.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/gma-hannahjordan-ht-kk-191017_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
