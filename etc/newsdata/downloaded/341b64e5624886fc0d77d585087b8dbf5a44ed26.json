It also manages to be both fun and trenchant, telling a caustic and modern story of haves and have-nots in the style of a Poirot novel. That same, sometimes weary touch of modernity reverberated through many of the films I\u2019ve seen thus far (the festival, which essentially kicks off the industry\u2019s awards season, started on September 5 and runs through September 15).\n\nA Hidden Life, Terrence Malick\u2019s World War II drama, is being billed by its studio, Fox Searchlight, as a return to form for a director who has been making abstract, nonnarrative work for years. Like his beloved 1998 film, The Thin Red Line, A Hidden Life is a war movie that\u2019s thoroughly anti-war, an exploration of how conflict disrupted the harmony of the natural world in the 1940s. The film follows its real-life subject, Franz J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter (played by August Diehl), a famous Austrian conscientious objector who refused to swear allegiance to Hitler, and it bears so many of Malick\u2019s hallmarks\u2014dreamy montages, spectacular pastoral photography, and voice-over narration. Yet it also opens with archival footage of Nazi torch rallies, and dramatizes the xenophobia and populism of the time in ways that play like a pointed comparison to contemporary politics\u2014an unusual departure for this director.\n\nMarriage Story, Noah Baumbach\u2019s tremendous and intimate story of love and divorce starring Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, recalls colossal domestic dramas of yesteryear such as Kramer vs. Kramer and Ordinary People. A slow-motion tragedy that traces the ghastly details of courtroom battles and gutting arguments between its central couple, the film is equal parts uproarious and upsetting, and an acting showcase for its stars. But whereas the female lead of Kramer vs. Kramer was a mostly absent, villainous figure, Marriage Story begins by laying out the emotional truths Johansson\u2019s character has realized about herself and her partnership, and then depicts how Driver\u2019s character fumbles toward those insights more slowly. The film\u2019s perspective shifts from the wife to the husband as it goes on, and while there\u2019s an autobiographical streak to Baumbach\u2019s script, the movie succeeds by avoiding simple caricatures.\n\nSeveral films at TIFF thus far have focused on the creative process with winsome melancholy. Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s Pain and Glory is a nakedly introspective tale about a director (Antonio Banderas) who\u2019s struggling to tap into his artistry as his body begins to break down. This quietly funny piece of career reflection from Almod\u00f3var succeeds because of its star, one of the director\u2019s longtime collaborators. The Japanese master Hirokazu Kore-eda made a surprising French- and English-language film (and his first shot outside of his home nation) called The Truth, a gentle comedy that follows a retiring grande dame of film (Catherine Deneuve) as she spars with her daughter (Juliette Binoche) and son-in-law (Ethan Hawke) on the set of a movie\u2014which itself has a fondness for the old days of true artistry. Then there\u2019s Eddie Murphy, who has largely avoided the limelight in recent years, producing and starring in a biopic of the blaxploitation legend Rudy Ray Moore called Dolemite Is My Name, a lively, joke-packed look at the making of the cult classic Dolemite in shambolic 1970s Los Angeles.\n\nDolemite Is My Name is one of many smart spins on the biopic, an eternal favorite for Oscar season and fall festivals alike. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, advertised on the slam-dunk casting of Tom Hanks as the children\u2019s entertainer Fred Rogers, is refreshing for how little it foregrounds its subject. Instead, Marielle Heller\u2019s film follows a mordant magazine writer (Matthew Rhys) assigned to write about Rogers and trying to crack his saintly mythos; the film works because Heller knows when to lean into the saccharine and when to tilt away, acknowledging the magic of Rogers as well as the reality of his limits. A similarly bittersweet true-story film is Fernando Meirelles\u2019s The Two Popes, a dramatization of the power handoff between Popes Benedict XVI (Anthony Hopkins) and Francis (Jonathan Pryce). The cleverly scripted two-hander tries to wrestle with the myriad crises within the Catholic Church but does so best when boiling the popes\u2019 debates down to a clash of personalities; it\u2019s a witty buddy movie that struggles to dig much deeper.", "description": "First impressions of some of the festival\u2019s buzziest films so far, including Knives Out, A Hidden Life, and Marriage Story", "authors": ["David Sims"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/knives/facebook.jpg?1568129331", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
