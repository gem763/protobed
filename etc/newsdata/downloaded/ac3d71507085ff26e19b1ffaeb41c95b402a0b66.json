REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nAlready higher on the day, the pound jumped above its 200-day moving average, a closely watched technical level, after the report as investors watched for any signs of a breakthrough in the Brexit talks.\n\nThe British currency climbed 1.5% on the day to $1.28 GBP=D3, a five-month high and also the first time it has gone above the 200-day moving average of $1.2713 since May.\n\nIt also rose by the same margin against the euro and was last trading 1.4% higher at 86.29 pence EURGBP=D3.\n\nSterling has risen nearly 5% higher over the past week as investors rushed to reprice the prospect of a last-minute Brexit deal by the end of Oct. 31 deadline.\n\n\u201cThe reaction from the markets shows they want to get this deal over and they are ready to push the button at the slightest sign of a deal,\u201d said Morten Lund, a senior FX strategist at Nordea.\n\nBut he said he was \u201ca bit more sceptical about the outcome\u201d given how little time remained to negotiate and the difficulties of getting a deal through the British Parliament.\n\nTalks aimed at reaching a Brexit deal with Brussels are continuing but there is still work to do, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said.\n\nKenneth Broux, a corporate FX strategist at Societe Generale, said he expected the pound to rally to $1.30 and even $1.35 if a deal gets through parliament, where Johnson lost his majority just weeks into his term.\n\nThe FTSE250 of UK mid-cap stocks .FTSC rose and European equity benchmarks extended their gains on the news.\n\nBritish government bond yields shot higher. The two-year gilt yield GB2YT=RR rose to its highest level since Sept. 16 at 0.575%, up 7.5 basis points on the day.\n\nThe move rippled into the broader European bond market with 10-year German government bond yields up 4 basis points to -0.41%, their highest in two and a half months. DE10YT=RR\n\n\u201cThe more uncertainty you remove the better for investors. If the prime minister and the EU were now to agree a deal, then the market would take that positively,\u201d said Edmund Shing, global head of equity derivatives strategy at BNP Paribas.\n\nBritain must reach a Brexit deal with the bloc by the end of Tuesday for it to be approved at a leaders\u2019 summit this week, the bloc\u2019s officials and diplomats said. Otherwise, Britain\u2019s scheduled departure date of Oct. 31 could be delayed.\n\nOfficials said it was still possible to reach a deal over customs arrangements on the island of Ireland by the Tuesday deadline, and if not, an extra summit could be called before the end of the month.\n\n(GRAPHIC - Pound and bonds: here)", "description": "Sterling surged on Tuesday to its highest level against the dollar and the euro since May while British stocks and government bond yields also rose after Bloomberg said British and EU negotiators were closing in on a draft Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Saikat Chatterjee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441151474&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1CI", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
