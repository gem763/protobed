(Work is another area of current focus for Uber: Earlier this month it launched a shift-finder app in Chicago, partnering with local staffing agencies but saying it would expand the offering to more areas \u201csoon\u201d.)\n\nSo, ultimately, Uber Moments looks intended to sit alongside a range of Uber-powered services, from ride-hailing to micromobility, employment and on-demand delivery.\n\nAs well as \u2014 most likely \u2014 new services Uber hasn\u2019t launched yet but needs to given its ongoing quest to hail a profitable business model.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to envisage Uber Moments rubbing shoulders with other branded tabs in Uber\u2019s \u2018uber app\u2019 \u2014 say Uber Stays, Uber Trips and Uber Cover, for example, if the company were to pivot towards travel; or Uber Clean, Uber Care and Uber Fix, if it decided to get in on on-demand home services.\n\nLast month it launched an incubator to develop new services to plug into its planned \u2018everything app\u2019. Khosrowshahi added the app would be \u201ca one-click gateway to everything that Uber can offer you\u201d \u2014 though what else it can offer which people will want to buy remains to be seen.\n\nThe company\u2019s reputation has taken a battering in recent years. And whether Uber has traveled far enough down the road of reforming its culture and detoxifying its brand for consumers to want to lean in and deepen their relationship, after earlier years of scandals plus ongoing question marks over issues like passenger safety, is not yet clear.\n\nIf Uber\u2019s ride-hailing business still can\u2019t weed out problematic drivers then consumers will have little reason to trust it to delivery a wider range of everyday services.", "description": "Uber is selling foodie experiences such as cooking classes and multi-course fine dining in its on-demand food delivery app, Uber Eats, under a new Moments tab, per Forbes, which reports on a small-scale test currently running in San Francisco.
