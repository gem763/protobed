(AP) - Nick Foles\u2018 debut with the Jacksonville Jaguars lasted 10 plays and ended with the high-priced quarterback sitting on the bench with a somber look on his face and a black sling around his left arm and shoulder.\n\nIt was the most memorable scene from what could go down as the biggest season-opening debacle in franchise history.\n\nFoles broke his left clavicle in a 40-26 loss to Kansas City and will have surgery Monday. He\u2019s expected to be placed on injured reserve, meaning he will miss a significant chunk of the season. He would be eligible to play again in Week 11, specifically Nov. 17 at Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the way you want to start your time here,\u201d Foles said. \u201cSometimes things don\u2019t happen like we expect them to, but we just have to have faith that it\u2019s for a reason.\u201d\n\nIt was far from the only issue for Jacksonville in the opener.\n\nThe defense missed tackles everywhere and was gashed for 491 yards as the Chiefs scored on their first seven possessions.\n\nLinebacker Myles Jack, a team captain who recently signed a four-year, $57 million extension, was ejected for throwing a punch, and burned in pass coverage twice.\n\nThe revamped offensive line, forced to play guard Will Richardson at left tackle because of injuries, was flagged for five holding penalties.\n\nRunning back Leonard Fournette fumbled near the red zone in a 10-point game in the third quarter, the first turnover of his three-year career.\n\nAnd rookie linebacker Quincy Williams reinjured his right knee and said after the game it already was swelling.\n\nAs for Foles, it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s injured his collarbone. He sustained a hairline fracture at Houston in 2014, didn\u2019t need surgery and missed the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a time span,\u201d Foles said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take it one day at a time. \u2026 I\u2019m going to do everything I can to get back as quickly as I can to where I\u2019m ready to roll.\u201d\n\nFoles knew something was wrong when a former Kansas City teammate, defensive tackle Chris Jones, landed on him after he threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to DJ Chark in the back corner of the end zone. Jones wasn\u2019t flagged for landing on top of the quarterback.\n\n\u201cEverything happened so fast,\u201d Foles said. \u201cI know he\u2019d never want to do that. It was probably just one of those things. It was just unfortunate it happened. I landed on it wrong and it happens in this sport. We\u2019ll keep moving forward. Chris is a tremendous player, and I gave him a hug after the game because I was excited to see him. He\u2019s a bright, young player.\u201d\n\nThe Jaguars signed Foles to a four-year, $88 million contract in March believing he would be the answer to the franchise\u2019s two-decade-long search for a quarterback.\n\nNow, he\u2019s sidelined indefinitely.\n\nThe injury leaves Gardner Minshew in line to start as a rookie. Minshew was one of the team\u2019s few bright spots against the Chiefs. He completed 22 of 25 passes for 275 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception.\n\nA sixth-round draft pick from Washington State, Minshew completed 88% of his passes and became the most accurate single-game passer in Jaguars history (minimum 25 attempts). His completion percentage also was the highest for any player with at least 15 pass attempts making their NFL debut.\n\nHis 275 yards passing were the most by a Jaguars quarterback in his NFL debut and the fifth most by a Jaguars rookie in a single game. Minshew completed his first 13 passes, the third-longest streak in franchise history.\n\n\u201cMy plan is to prove that I am the best I can be for this team every day at practice and every snap I get in a game,\u201d Minshew said. \u201cThat\u2019s my job. It\u2019s not to figure out if we need to sign a new quarterback. My job is to go out there and be the best I can be for our team.\u201d\n\nJacksonville will have to sign another quarterback. The team has Chase Litton on the practice squad, and he signed earlier this week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fired up for the challenge,\u201d coach Doug Marrone said. \u201cObviously it\u2019s unfortunate. \u2026 I really feel like we\u2019ve got to step up and go. It\u2019s a great challenge. \u2026 Players are going to look at it. Players are going to read it. Fans are going to read it.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m fired up for this team. I\u2019m going to get this team ready to go, and we\u2019re going to win football games.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nick Foles' debut with the Jacksonville Jaguars lasted 10 plays and ended with the high-priced quarterback sitting on the bench with a somber look on his face and a black sling around his left arm and shoulder.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Long"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/chiefs_jaguars_football_26491_c0-182-4345-2715_s1770x1032.jpg?c92002c8bde0c7f7c7a558e37b5b80f844680bfa", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
