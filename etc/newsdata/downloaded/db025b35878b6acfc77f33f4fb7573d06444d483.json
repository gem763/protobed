That information has been added to the article.\u201d The book, due for release this week, is authored by two Times reporters.\n\nThe correction was prompted not by the Times\u2019 own fact-checking but after Mollie Hemingway, a senior editor at The Federalist and co-author of a book detailing the Kavanaugh debacle, identified the blatant error on Twitter early Sunday morning. (The Times has refused to review Hemingway\u2019s book, which was released in July.)\n\nBut by the time \u201cAmerica\u2019s newspaper of record\u201d sheepishly admitted its (intentional) error, the damage had been done. Democratic lawmakers and presidential candidates called for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment while celebrities and columnists wailed about the patriarchy, white privilege and, of course, the Bad Orange Man. Willfully ignorant zombies on the Left continue to regurgitate the falsehood.\n\nRewriting History\n\nThe timing of the Times\u2019 latest fraud is notable for its coincidence: Three years ago and one year ago this month, Democrats, with full complicity from the media, unleashed two of the most divisive and fabricated campaigns against Trump World: The Trump-Russia collusion hoax and the Kavanaugh rape charges.\n\nIn September 2016, Yahoo News posted its infamous article authored by Michael Isikoff that suggested Trump campaign aide Carter Page was a Kremlin tool\u2014the piece was sourced by dossier author Christopher Steele and cited as evidence in the FISA warrant against Page\u2014publicly fueling the nascent Russian collusion storyline. And in September 2018, the Washington Post identified Christine Blasey Ford as the woman accusing Kavanaugh of decades-old sexual assault.\n\nBut despite the widespread misconduct, malfeasance, and irreversible political, professional, and personal damage connected to both travesties, not one person\u2014lawmaker, staffer, reporter, or witness\u2014has been held accountable for their actions. The perpetrators, thus far, have suffered no consequences.\n\nTo the contrary, mouthpieces for both scandals are cashing in by selling books that rewrite history, or worse, fabricate more charges intended to inflict additional harm. (A former Comey aide and current CNN contributor also will release a book this week that whitewashes his former boss\u2019s leading role in the Russian collusion hoax.)\n\nNo Evidence? No Problem\n\nHere are just a few offenses that remain unpunished: High-level public officials leaked classified information to the media\u2014a felony\u2014in 2017 in an attempt to destroy Page and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Top Justice Department officials, including former FBI Director James Comey, submitted fabricated evidence to a secret court while refusing to disclose the financial motivations of the key source. Several people, including Fusion GPS chief Glenn Simpson, misled Congress.\n\nFBI agents accepted gifts and other perks from friendly news reporters in exchange for unauthorized leaks of nonpublic information. Several officials and sources, including Steele, lied to federal investigators, committing both perjury and obstruction of justice. Lawmakers such as Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) misled Congress and the American public about evidence of Russian collusion for years.\n\nNumerous witnesses, including Blasey Ford, made false statements to Congress and attempted to obstruct justice in a concerted ploy to delay a public hearing and permit time for more unfounded allegations to surface. (Recall how Blasey Ford\u2019s celebrity legal team claimed she was afraid to fly despite social media posts boasting about her international travel.)\n\nAfter the Kavanaugh confirmation vote, the Senate Judiciary Committee, then led by Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), issued a lengthy report detailing the fiasco. The report concluded that \u201cinvestigators found no verifiable evidence that supported Dr. Ford\u2019s allegations against Justice Kavanaugh. The witnesses that Dr. Ford identified as individuals who could corroborate her allegations failed to do so, and in fact, contradicted her.\u201d\n\nDeborah Ramirez, a subject of the Times\u2019 reporters\u2019 new book and another alleged Kavanaugh victim, repeatedly refused to cooperate with the committee\u2019s probe after she was featured in a lengthy New Yorker expose making more unfounded claims against Kavanaugh. \u201cCommittee investigators found no verifiable evidence to support Ramirez\u2019s allegations,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIn other words, these women made up false accusations against an innocent man and presented those phony claims to the United State Senate and to the FBI, which is a federal crime.\n\nGrassley did refer two perpetrators in the Kavanaugh travesty, attorney Michael Avenatti and accuser Julie Swetnick, to the Justice Department: \u201cI ask that the FBI investigate whether Mr. Avenatti criminally conspired with Ms. Swetnick to make materially false statements to the Committee and obstruct the Committee\u2019s investigation,\u201d Grassley wrote in October 2018.\n\nNeither of them has been charged. Christine Blasey Ford now is heralded as a feminist hero and raked in GoFundMe contributions while Ramirez is enjoying yet another turn in the public spotlight.\n\nFurther, the journalists, columnists, cable news hosts and editors who perpetuated both scams at great cost to the country as a whole remain employed and unchastened. (Keep in mind that Fusion GPS paid \u201cmedia companies [and] journalists\u201d to report their political propaganda. A list of names remains under seal.) It\u2019s hard to argue that conduct doesn\u2019t meet the legal threshold of conspiring to defraud the United States.\n\nEmpty Threats, Unkept Promises\n\nThreats made by the president, Grassley, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and other Republican leaders to hold the perpetrators accountable are unfulfilled. As I wrote last November, Republicans, with few exceptions, are as responsible as Democrats for mismanaging the Russian collusion matter from the beginning.\n\nWhere is the declassification of key documents, including texts and emails between key collaborators, we\u2019ve been promised? Where are the Senate hearings to compel public testimony from the wrongdoers in these scandals?\n\nWhere is an indictment or investigation into the people who have been referred to the Justice Department, including Steele, Avenatti, and Swetnick, by Senate Republicans? Where are the charges against former Obama officials who illegally leaked classified information to reporters more than two years ago? Where is the public hearing about the Justice Department inspector general\u2019s reports on both the Clinton email investigation and Comey\u2019s mishandling of his own memos? Where are the ethics charges against Schiff, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D.-Calif.), and Senator Cory Booker (D.-N.J.)?\n\nWe are reassured constantly that Inspector General Michael Horowitz, Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham have all of this under control. But much like the costly delay in the Kavanaugh-Ford hearing, further delays foster more bad behavior, encourage more phony claims of wrongdoing against innocent people, and postpones the comeuppance that the American public is impatiently waiting to see.\n\nThe old adage that justice delayed is justice denied painfully applies here. Brett Kavanaugh and his family found this out\u2014again\u2014the very hard way. It\u2019s time for Republicans, including and especially the president, to stop this injustice today. Trump tweeted several times over the weekend and on Monday about the latest smear on Kavanaugh, suggesting that \u201cthe Justice Department should come to [Kavanaugh\u2019s] rescue.\u201d\n\nLast I checked, Trump is in charge of the Justice Department. Bill Barr, a lifelong Republican, runs the department. Republican Senator Mitch McConnell controls the Senate and Graham chairs the judiciary committee. What\u2019s the point of having political power if you can\u2019t protect your own people from egregious attacks or punish those who break the law to do so?\n\nThis isn\u2019t a harmless game or an opportunity for pointless Twitter banter from the president. It\u2019s time to follow through on empty threats and promises and stop this dangerous cycle. At this point, Republicans have no one to blame but themselves.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1042080282.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
