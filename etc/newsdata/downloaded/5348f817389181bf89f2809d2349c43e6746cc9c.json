The media was also alerted in advance about summons of lawmakers, heads of local autonomous governments, politicians and celebrities.In those cases, the media were also allowed to take photos of witnesses or suspects when they entered buildings for questioning or arrest.\u201cQuestions have been continuously raised inside and outside the prosecution about the need to improve the public summoning of suspects and witnesses to protect their rights,\u201d the SPO said. It said the prosecution is trying to guarantee human rights while also guaranteeing the people\u2019s right to know and the media\u2019s responsibilities.The decision was announced shortly after the prosecution faced criticism for summoning Chung Kyung-sim, wife of Justice Minister Cho Kuk, without informing the media. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office on Thursday summoned Chung and questioned her mainly about an alleged forgery of an award for her daughter\u2019s medical school application.Chung arrived for questioning around 9 a.m. and left around 5 p.m. Sources in the prosecution said the questioning actually ended around 4 p.m., because Chung asked it to stop, citing poor health.\u201cAt her request, the questioning was stopped, and she was sent home,\u201d a prosecution official told the JoongAng Ilbo. \u201cWe informed her that she will be called for questioning again at a later date.\u201d Sources said Chung left without signing a statement.The prosecution informed reporters about Chung\u2019s departure only after she left, using a passageway not open to the media.The opposition Liberty Korea Party (LKP) complained that the prosecution caved in to administration pressure and gave Chung \u201cimperial\u201d treatment by keeping her away from the media. Ruling party politicians, however, said it was desirable to protect the human rights of the suspect.Under the changed public affairs rules, the prosecution will not inform the media in advance even if it summons Cho, which would be the first questioning of an incumbent justice minister.\u201cThe change means we won\u2019t make distinctions between public figures and ordinary people,\u201d said an SPO official. \u201cIt means we will not inform the media about any questioning schedule.\u201dHe dismissed concerns that the change will infringe upon the public\u2019s right to information. \u201cWe don\u2019t intend to keep all investigations secret,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to prevent any possible human rights violations when questioning of suspects is revealed by the media in advance.\u201dThe decision to stop informing the media about questioning schedules is the second reform measure taken by the prosecution this week. On Tuesday, Yoon announced that he will shut down all special investigation departments nationwide, except for three key units.The series of measures follow President Moon Jae-in\u2019s order that the prosecution must reform its ways of exercising prosecutorial rights and conducting investigations to respect human rights.Yoon apparently made the decision to announce reform measures day after day to show that the expanding probes into the Cho family are continuing - and can coexist with changes to the ways things are done. Cho, who served as senior presidential secretary for civil affairs in the Moon Blue House and was appointed to head the Justice Ministry last month, is a strong advocate of prosecutorial reform.Although Moon said the prosecution should carry out reform measures after the investigation into the scandals surrounding Cho and his family, Yoon is defying that message and preemptively implementing the changes.The prosecution continued its investigation into various allegations surrounding Cho\u2019s family. It asked the Seoul Central District Court to issue a warrant on Friday to detain Cho\u2019s younger brother to investigate suspicions that he filed false lawsuits against the Ungdong School Foundation, which is operated by the Cho family.The prosecution questioned Cho on Sept. 26, Sept. 27 and on Tuesday about allegations that he and his ex-wife had filed a phony lawsuit to obtain bonds worth 10 billion won ($8.35 million) from the private school foundation. They filed the suit in 2006, but the school did not defend itself, allowing their legal victory. After their divorce, Cho\u2019s ex-wife filed a similar suit again in 2017, and the school again forfeited its defense.The prosecution believes the school intentionally gave up its rights. It is also looking into the possibility that Cho and his wife were involved in the suspected crimes, as they served as directors of the school foundation at the time of the lawsuits.Cho\u2019s younger brother is also suspected of receiving bribes in return for offering jobs to teachers. The prosecution also suspects that he tried to tamper with witnesses to get rid of evidence.If the court issues a warrant, he will become the second member of the Cho family to be taken into state custody. The prosecution had already detained Cho\u2019s cousin\u2019s son and indicted him over alleged financial crimes related to a private equity fund invested in by the Cho family.Meanwhile, Cho Min, Cho\u2019s 28-year-daughter, broke her silence Friday and denied allegations about her admissions to college and medical school. \u201cThe entire family has become a prey of the media,\u201d she said in an interview with TBS radio. \u201cPersonally, I think it is cruel.\u201dCho Min gave an interview to \u201cKim Eo-jun\u2019s News Factory,\u201d a program seen as being pro-Moon. In the interview, she said she actually participated in internships and volunteer work to win certificates, dismissing media speculation that they were fake.She denied the suspicion that her mother forged an award to help her get into medical school. She said she is worried that her mother could falsely admit to the charge to protect her.\u201cIf you read media reports, my mother is already convicted,\u201d she said. \u201cI think she will lay bare her truth through a trial. I will also lay bare the truth in a courtroom, and I will also newly explore my life.\u201dCho Min said she did not get her father\u2019s permission for the radio interview. \u201cWhen I told my father about giving an interview, he fiercely opposed, so I just came here without telling him,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents worry about me so much because I am their young daughter, but I am an adult and this is about me. So I want to make public my position without going through my parents.\u201dBY SER MYO-JA [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
