( ROKU ) has had an incredible rally this calendar year. Just $30 a share in early January and trading above $150 now. Wow.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of ROKU, below, we can see this journey higher. Prices are more than $30 above the rising 50-day moving average line and about $80 above the rising 200-day line. Sounds extended to me.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a strong rise from January telling us that buyers of ROKU have been more aggressive.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is above the zero line in a bullish configuration but the two averages that make up the indicator have been narrowing.\n\nIn this weekly Japanese candlestick chart of ROKU, below, we see no reversal patterns.\n\nIn this first Point and Figure chart of ROKU, below, we can see the straight up rally and that prices have exceeded a price target.\n\nIn this second Point and Figure chart of ROKU, we used weekly data and here too prices have exceeded a price target.\n\nBottom line strategy: ROKU has rallied a long way in a short period of time. Prices are extended but the uptrend is still intact. It wouldn't hurt to take some profits and raise your sell stop to $130 on the balance.", "description": "Let's review the charts and indicators to see if there is more to come....ROKU", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Shares Of Roku Look Extended Here", "Book Some Profits", "Raise Stops", "Let'S Review The Charts", "Indicators To See If There Is More To Come.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Collins"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/f9467d6d-ba05-11e9-805f-e9a0aa35bed3.png"}
