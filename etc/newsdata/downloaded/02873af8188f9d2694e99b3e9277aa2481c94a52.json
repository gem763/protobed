They ended up at the National Museum of Finland in Helsinki.\n\nThe museum took an inventory of the collection and determined it contains 600 items, including the remains of 20 individuals and 28 funerary objects.\n\nMr. Pence, who is no relation to Vice President Mike Pence, said the situation was outlined in a stack of papers he found on his desk when he took over the job. He thanked the State Department and Finnish government for striking an agreement to return the remains and objects.\n\nMr. Trump, who delights in taking care of problems that festered under previous administrations, said the situation languished for \u201cmany, many years.\u201d\n\nThe president announced the agreement during a raucous press conference that focused on a House impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nWhile Mr. Niinisto stood quietly, Mr. Trump accused Democrats of pushing a \u201cscam\u201d and \u201cfraudulent crime on the American people.\u201d\n\nThe leaders did manage to squeeze in some details from their bilateral talks.\n\nThey discussed ways to repel Russia\u2019s military buildup in the Arctic and China\u2019s own forays into the region.\n\nThe Chinese have claimed \u201cnear-Arctic\u201d status, a designation the Trump administration finds ludicrous.\n\n\u201cSimply put, we believe that the affairs of the Arctic should be governed by the actual nations of the Arctic,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAs you know, there are other people coming into the Arctic and we don\u2019t like it. And we can\u2019t let it happen, and we won\u2019t let it happen.\u201d\n\nA joint statement released by the U.S. and Finnish presidents said the Arctic does offer economic opportunities for their own nations, \u201cbut environmental changes such as the diminishing of sea ice raise environmental concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States and Finland share a commitment to clean air and water and environmental protection, including the reduction of particulate matter, and with it, black carbon,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMr. Trump also said Finland is a vital partner in ensuring the security of 5G cellular networks, citing the partnership between Nokia, a Finnish telecom giant, and Bell Labs in New Jersey.\n\nThe U.S. is encouraging European nations to use alternatives to Huawei, a Chinese company the administration blacklisted over fears its 5G equipment could be used for espionage or to disrupt American networks \u2014 a charge the company denies.\n\nMr. Niinisto said the European Union is conducting a risk assessment of Huawei that will be completed within a few weeks.\n\n\u201cAfter that, we have to decide together, in the European Union, which kind of tools we need to protect ourselves,\u201d Mr. Niinisto said.\n\nThe Finnish leader acknowledged that Nokia is also a major player in the 5G arena, but said the company can speak for itself as the security debate unfolds.\n\nMr. Trump also offered his condolences after a sword-wielding attacker killed one woman and injured 10 others at a vocational school in the Finnish city of Kuopio this week.\n\nMr. Niinisto, meanwhile, complimented the U.S. history on display at a number of Smithsonian museums he visited in Washington.\n\n\u201cMr. President, you have here a great democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep it going on.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
