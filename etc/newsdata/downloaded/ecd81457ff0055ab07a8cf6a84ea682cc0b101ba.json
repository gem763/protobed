Xi doesn't look just like Winnie the Pooh at all,\" the statement added, a reference to banned memes comparing Chinese President Xi Jinping with AA Milne's portly bear.\n\n\"Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?\" the statement read.\n\nOn Tuesday, searches for \"South Park\" on China's Twitter-like social media platform Weibo and popular film review site Douban did not return any results.\n\nAnd while information on South Park was still available on a few video streaming sites, episodes could not be played.\n\nParker and Stone's response to China stands in stark contrast to that of major Western brands who have quickly beaten a retreat when faced with potential losses in China's huge -- and fiercely nationalistic -- consumer market.\n\nCompanies ranging from airlines to fashion houses have issued fulsome apologies, often after being charged with \"hurting the feelings of the Chinese people\".\n\nAs well as any indication of support for protests in Hong Kong, common crimes include labelling Taiwan as a separate country -- China believes it is a renegade province -- or discussing Xinjiang, where rights groups say a million mostly-Muslim minorities are being held in prison camps", "description": "The creators of \"South Park\" have issued a mock apology to China after censors scrubbed their popular animation from the Chinese web.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6032/35152837b0e643898260350543caf719.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
