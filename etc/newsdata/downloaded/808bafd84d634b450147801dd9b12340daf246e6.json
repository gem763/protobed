But this was American Airlines Flight 2201, bound for New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy, and inside the plane\u2019s slender form, it had all the trappings of an international flight: enclosed suites in first class, a business class with sleeper seats, Champagne and fresh-brewed espresso on demand.\n\nWhich airlines do you think provide the best business and first-class services? Join the conversation below.\n\nThese unexpected perks have been increasingly showing up in the front of the plane on some domestic flights, with even a low-cost airline like JetBlue getting into the act. It conjures a long-ago time when airlines offered transcontinental passengers niceties like sleeper berths, piano bars and genuinely restaurant-style meals. \u201cThey\u2019re going for less mass and more class,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Research, noting that many of these flights are via single-aisle jets.\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub: Only certain planes and a handful of routes offer the souped-up cabins, mainly flying out of major international hubs like New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and San Francisco. That\u2019s partly because U.S. airlines have been prodded by their foreign-flag competition to up their game on domestic flights that might connect with overseas jaunts. \u201cIt\u2019s to give the business traveler a more consistent experience,\u201d said Mr. Harteveldt, pointing out that it can be something of a shock to go from a true business class to a ho-hum domestic equivalent. Here, a few of the planes and routes that adhere to the trend\u2014the cream of the domestic crop:\n\nThe Aircraft: American Airlines Airbus A321\n\nThe Cabins: Flagship First and Business Class\n\nRoutes: New York to Los Angeles and San Francisco, Miami to L.A. over Christmas holiday weeks\n\nPoints of Distinction: The entire plane only has 102 seats versus 180-plus on a normal A321 layout, with a genuine First Class where you can stretch out in one of 10 sleeper pods. There\u2019s an espresso machine to help jolt you awake, post-nap. The Business Class cabin accommodates 20 lie-flat beds, and 36 economy \u201cextra\u201d seats with extra legroom and complimentary cocktails. And premium passengers can feast on curated chow from Hawaiian chef Sam Choy.\n\nThe Aircraft: Delta Boeing 757/767, Airbus A330\n\nThe Cabins: Delta One\n\nRoutes: New York, Boston and Washington to the West Coast, Atlanta to Honolulu\n\nPoints of Distinction: A hybrid of first class and business, Delta One cabins can be found on some single-aisle 757s and several wide-body models on flights from key business markets on the East Coast to the West Coast. They have many of the same perks you\u2019d find on a long-haul flight across the ocean, with cocoon-like seating, designer sheets and Tumi amenity kits, plus it still has widescreen seat-back entertainment for those who prefer not to fiddle with their devices.\n\nThe Aircraft: JetBlue Airbus A321\n\nThe Cabins: Mint\n\nRoutes: Transcontinental routes and select Caribbean routes\n\nPoints of Distinction: The introduction of the Mint cabin in 2014 gave business travelers a reason to defect from the major airlines to this lower-cost alternative. It comes with 16 6\u20198\u201d lie-flat seats, including several rows with enclosed \u201cMint Suites.\u201d Trendiness abounds, with eats from hot spot Saxon & Parole in Manhattan\u2019s East Village, wines from Napa and fresh espresso via Brooklyn\u2019s Roasting Company. It\u2019s offered on cross-country routes\u2014including one of the newest destinations, Seattle. JetBlue doesn\u2019t have airport lounges, but Mint customers get expedited airport security and checked-bag handling.\n\nThe Aircraft: United Boeing 757/777\n\nThe Cabins: Business Class\n\nRoutes: Newark to Los Angeles and San Francisco, Boston to San Francisco\n\nPoints of Distinction: United, like Delta, has a mix of narrow- and wide-body jets on its marquee domestic routes. If you\u2019re sitting upfront on a 757-200 from Newark or Boston to L.A. or San Francisco you\u2019ll be on its latest iteration of what used to be called \u201cp.s.\u201d service, with a capacious business class sporting 28 lie-flat seats. The 6 feet of sleeping space comes with Saks Fifth Avenue bedding and Cowshed toiletries, the same amenities you\u2019d find on the airline\u2019s longest international flights.", "description": "But only on some planes and some routes.
