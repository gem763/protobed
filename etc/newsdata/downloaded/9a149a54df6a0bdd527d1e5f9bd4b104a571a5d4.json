There was a time I let you know what high fashion had done for me, I was letting you know what the Hennessy had done for me... now I'm letting you know what Jesus has done for me.\"\n\nHe also talked about being a \"Christian innovator\" and his Sunday services, which blend music and spirituality in a nontraditional way.\n\n\"God doesn't exist only in four walls,\" West said. \"God is everything and everywhere.\"\n\nBut one of his biggest revelations, which he knew would cause a stir, is what he sometimes asked of his collaborators.\n\n\"There's times where I was asking people to not have premarital sex while they were working on the album,\" West said. \"There were times when I went to people who were working on other projects and said 'Could you please just work and focus on this.' \"\n\nWest said he wanted everyone to be in one accord.\n\n\"It's known when people pray together, families that pray together stay together,\" he said. \"When people pray together and fast together the power is increased.\"\n\nWest said his conversion happened in April after Coachella. He said God helped him beat his addictions to pornography and sex.\n\n\"Playboy was my gateway into full-on pornography addiction,\" he said. \"My dad had a Playboy left out at age 5, and it's affected almost every choice I made for the rest of my life from age 5 to now, having to kick the habit.\"\n\nIt's not the first time West has discussed his transformation.\n\nOn \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" he and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, clashed over her formfitting outfit for the Met Ball.\n\nHe said the outfit was too sexy and it affected his soul and spirit when she dressed provocatively.\n\nKardashian West told her husband he encouraged her to dress that way in the past and, \"Just because you're on a journey and you're in a transformation doesn't mean I'm in the same spot with you.\"", "description": "Kanye West is a changed man.", "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160504182605-kanye-west-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
