He slashed his price target on the Canada-listed stock to C$5 \u2014 31% below current levels \u2014 from C$7.\n\nThe Canada-listed shares ACB, -7.75% shed 7.8%, while the U.S.-listed shares ACB, -8.40% slumped 8.4% in active trading. Volume in the U.S.-listed stock topped 33.8 million shares, compared with the full-day average of about 13.3 million shares over the last month, according to FactSet data.\n\nAurora reported last week a wider-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter loss and revenue that missed lowered expectations, sending the stock tumbling over 9% last Thursday.

CGC, +1.09% WEED, +1.40% , which led to the ousting of high-profile co-Chief Executive Bruce Linton, and after cigarette seller Altria Group Inc. MO, -1.43% said it would pay the equivalent of $1.8 billion for a 45% stake in Cronos Corp. CRON, -0.69% CRON, -0.98%\n\nSee related: Canopy Growth\u2019s remaining CEO talks about pot company\u2019s shake-up, and the search for his replacement.\n\nCarter said Aurora will likely have trouble competing with rivals Canopy Growth and Cronos in the global cannabis market until it can tout a partnership with a well-established and vested consumer partner. While those partnerships helped provide significant capital \u201cde-risking\u201d for Canopy Growth and Cronos, the risk has increased for Aurora given the recent volatility in the equity markets and uncertainty over Aurora\u2019s willingness and ability to attract a partner.\n\n\u201cAurora has given mixed commentary on pursuing partnerships, but we believe the company will be required to continue pursuing an independent path with global consumer companies likely taking a wait-and-see approach to the sector with less incentive to partner with a Canadian L.P.,\u201d Carter wrote.\n\nAurora\u2019s stock has tumbled 27.9% over the past three months, while the ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchange-traded fund MJ, -2.50% has slumped 21% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.31% has gained 3.9%.", "description": "Aurora stock falls after Stifel Nicolaus analyst Andrew Carter turns bearish, slashes price target in wake of \u201cbad\u201d quarterly results.", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR369_Aurora_ZG_20190916112054.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
