She made one of her first appearances in the F4 British Championships at Brands Hatch last October. This weekend Juffali is back at the historic 2.4-mile circuit in Kent, driving for Double R Racing, the Woking-based team formed in 2004 by 2007 Formula One champion Kimi Raikkonen and his race manager, Steve Robertson.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m nervous,\u201d Juffali, who now lives between London and Jeddah, says about the the season closer. \u201cI\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\nJuffali is already starting to create somewhat of a buzz when she turns up to compete, mainly because it\u2019s still so rare to see a woman in the cockpit. In early August, while preparing to race at Snetterton in Norfolk, a steady stream of spectators \u2013 many of them young families \u2013 were stopping by Double R\u2019s paddock to snap pictures of her.\n\nJuffali\u2019s passion for fast cars dates back to her teenage years.
