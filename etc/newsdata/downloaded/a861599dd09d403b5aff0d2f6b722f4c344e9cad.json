It will be the first time Parliament has convened on a Saturday since 1982, amid the Falklands War.\n\nNonetheless, that all depends on the last-ditch talks to get over the largest stumbling block to a Brexit deal \u2014 namely the Irish \"backstop\" issue \u2014 an insurance policy to ensure there is no hard border on the island of Ireland in the event of no post-Brexit trade deal.\ufeff", "description": "The U.K. and EU are gearing up for what could be the busiest week in British politics since June 2016.", "authors": ["Holly Ellyatt"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106179591-1571037049871gettyimages-1168653719.jpeg?v=1571037129", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
