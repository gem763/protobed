But the Turkish leader has said he would only agree to a cease-fire if Kurdish forces abandon key positions in Syria.\n\nU.S. officials acknowledge the odds are slim for an immediate halt to the weeklong conflict. The visit comes as Trump faces bipartisan condemnation in Washington for withdrawing American troops from northern Syria, which paved the way for the Turkish incursion.\n\n___\n\n8:55 a.m.\n\nA senior U.S. delegation on its way to Turkey is facing a herculean task \u2014 to pressure Turkish officials to accept a cease-fire in Northern Syria just hours after President Donald Trump declared the U.S. has no stake in defending its Kurdish allies.\n\nVice President Mike Pence is heading a U.S. delegation that includes Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien. They are set to arrive in Turkey Thursday afternoon, a day after Trump dismissed the very crisis he sent his aides on an emergency mission to douse.\n\nTrump suggested Wednesday that a Kurdish group was a greater terror threat than Islamic State militants. He also welcomed the efforts of Russia and the Assad government to fill the void left by the U.S. withdrawal.", "description": "Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (pahm-PAY'-oh) have arrived in Turkey to mount an improbable push for a cease-fire in Syria.
