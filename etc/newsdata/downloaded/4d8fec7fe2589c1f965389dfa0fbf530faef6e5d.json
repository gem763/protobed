All of this can be delightful to see, but it can also make for tricky gift buying.\n\nHere we have gathered a selection of presents at a range of price points, in a bid to provide options for big Christmas and birthday presents but also for the endless parade of classmate\u2019s birthday parties that can dominate the life of a five-year-old\u2019s parents.\n\nWe have sought to offer ideas that will appeal to a range of tastes, but that always constitute value for money.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice.

The oversized, hardback original volume was the standout gift at one of our tester\u2019s fifth birthday parties, and this sequel, in which the young detective again must do sleuthing battle against the mysterious Mr X, this time against the elaborate and elegant backdrop of a 1920s \u201cnew maze city\u201d, is a triumphant follow up. A very classy party gift.\n\nBuy now\n\nOrchard Toys magic spelling: \u00a310.40, Amazon\n\nOrchard Toys are the masters of educational games for young children and this recently released literacy version of its excellent magic maths game is a great way to get reception age children engaged with spelling. As with the maths version, sturdy magical playing cards reveal the correct answers when rubbed, as players race to collect comedy ingredients (such as unicorn poo and goblin socks) for their spells. Wholesome fun and a good choice for a classmate\u2019s birthday \u2013 particularly if you\u2019re looking to get brownie points with the parents.\n\nBuy now\n\nJo Jo Maman Bebe fox fisherman\u2019s jacket: \u00a339, Jo Jo Maman Bebe\n\nMany of us know five-year-olds who have more toys than they could ever play with, and parents who are meanwhile frazzled by the expensive desire to keep their ever-growing children well attired. In such cases, deeper-pocketed grandparents could do far worse than to weigh in with a gift of high quality clothing that will get plenty of use. This charming waterproof jacket ticks this box perfectly and, with its fox ear and tail decorations, is fun enough to be well received by its young recipient too. It\u2019s machine washable and cotton lined, and the size 5-6 would be pretty roomy on most five-year-olds, leaving space for a thick jumper underneath. Perfect for autumn/ winter park trips \u2013 though probably not thick enough for the coldest days.\n\nBuy now\n\nHot Wheels ultimate garage: \u00a373.99, Amazon\n\nNot recommended for anyone who is short on space, this is a hefty new Hot Wheels set that is likely to induce whoops of joy from any fan of toy cars. There really is no rhyme or reason behind the chomping shark jaws at the centre of this multi-storey edifice, which includes parking (and thus storage) for 90 vehicles and a double lane loop for racing (or being chomped), but your average five-year-old does not need logic when they have small, air-jumping cars.\n\nBuy now\n\nJoules rocket backpack: \u00a324.45, Joules\n\nIt\u2019s pricey no doubt, but this rocket shaped backpack, complete with roaring flames at its base, is also about the most fun a five-year-old could possibly have with a backpack. This is one of those fun gifts that any kid would love \u2013 think charging along the pavement while pretending to be blasting through space \u2013 but is also useful, which parents will appreciate. Fifth birthdays, lest we forget, happen during reception and this distinctive and hard wearing bag is the perfect size for sports kits or school trips.\n\nBuy now\n\n\u2018DC Brave and Bold!: Female DC Super Heroes Take on the Universe\u2019 by Sam Maggs, published by Dorling Kindersley Ltd: \u00a312.99, Waterstones\n\nThis new hardback is a sort of Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls\u2019 equivalent for superhero fans, with double page spreads each telling the story of a different female character from the DC universe. It\u2019s fair to say that some are a little more obscure than others, but with Wonder Woman and Supergirl in the mix you\u2019re unlikely to go far wrong. The illustrations are great and, while girl power books have become a bit overdone in recent years, this one is considerably more inspiring than others. Definitely not just for girls.\n\nBuy now\n\nLego Mars space shuttle: \u00a318, Amazon\n\nThis space shuttle is part of Lego\u2019s ever-expanding city range and is the right kind of complexity for the average five-year-old. It also offers more play potential, with its accompanying Mars rover and mini-astronauts, than many sets in this kind of price range. Lego really kicks in when kids hit five as a fantastic tool for engineering practice and imaginative construction, and this 273-piece set, recently updated and branded as \u201cinspired by NASA\u2019s Mars exploration programme\u201d, would be a good way in for newbies or a welcome addition to most collections.\n\nBuy now\n\nPlanet Junko zoomer kit: \u00a339.99, Planet Junko\n\nPlanet Junko has created an award-winning range of kits designed to revive the old-fashioned and eco-friendly notion that household bits and bobs can be transformed into satisfying toys. This zoomer kit provides the base for any four-wheeled vehicle you can conjure up from old cereal packets, juice cartons and yoghurt pots, and includes \u201cJ-fix\u201d clips, some of which contain magnets that can be used to stick components together without the aid of glue and tape. Made from recycled plastic, and can be used over and over again. Parental involvement is vital, but that\u2019s part of the fun, right? A great antidote to the prevailing culture of disposable plastic toys.\n\nBuy now\n\nVTech kidigear walkie talkies: \u00a330, Argos\n\nIf your five-year-old is a fan of pretending to be a spy, superhero, ninja, or indeed all three as our testers are, then these new walkie talkies are likely to go down well. They have a range of up to 200M, and a digital connection to prevent the unlikely eventuality that anyone else would want to listen in to their ramblings, as well as some comedy voice changing effects and the usual expendable VTech games. This could also be deployed to keep a couple of siblings entertained on a family walk (think sending messages to each other while hiding in bushes en route), as long as you don\u2019t mind being the least popular ramblers on the path.\n\nBuy now\n\nHasbro cluedo junior: \u00a315, Argos\n\nAll the five-year-olds we know love this junior version of the classic detective game, with the usual race to find out whodunnit getting just the right amount of tetchy towards the end. Clobbering victims with candlesticks is perhaps a bit much at that age, however, and so Hasbro has chosen fiendish cake-snaffling as the crime to be solved. Great value, making is a solid option as a party gift, but also perhaps one that you\u2019ll want to keep for yourself.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Gifts for five-year-olds\n\nOur testers can\u2019t get enough of Pierre the Maze Detective, and so that gets best buy status. If you\u2019re looking for educational as well as fun, you won\u2019t go far wrong with Orchard Toy\u2019s magic spelling.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
