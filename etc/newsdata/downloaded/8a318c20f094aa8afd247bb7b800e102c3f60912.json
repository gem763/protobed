Speakers also included Donald Trump Jr., Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Dinesh D'Souza. The event was organized professionally. The speakers were inspiring. The crowd was enthusiastic. And the energy was sky high.\n\nBut it turned out the liberal media sent spies into the audience to try to ruin, denigrate and demonize the event, and kill all the joy. Guess who they went after.\n\nYours truly.\n\nTheir agenda was to paint conservatives as \"violent.\" First, they went after a fake Trump video supposedly played in a back room of the event that no one ever saw. When that didn't work, they went after me.\n\nNothing violent about me, right? Wrong. When liberals want to slander you, they can take any sentence out of context to hang you -- as long as they leave out the actual details and context. They do this to President Trump every day.\n\nI gave a speech about how to beat Democrats in 2020. It centered on the fact that liberals and the liberal media are bullies -- out to intimidate, ban, censor, persecute, beat us into submission.\n\nI told an inspiring, heartwarming story of my high school past, a story of how I became the real-life \"Karate Kid,\" how I morphed from a nerd, persecuted and brutalized by bullies, to a champion fighter who turned the tables on the bullies.\n\nI started out as a skinny Jewish kid with acne, braces and thick glasses attending one of America's roughest and most violent urban high schools. I was tortured, intimidated, persecuted and beaten -- in the bathrooms and lunchrooms, on the playground and after school.\n\nBut one summer, I changed my life. I learned how to fight, lifted weights like a maniac, got contact lenses and took off my braces. I came back to school, and when the first three tough guys attacked me, I responded in self-defense and beat them each badly. My classmates cheered. The nerd became the hero. I made the bullies cry.\n\nNo one ever bullied me again. From that day forward, I was the protector of the nerds.\n\nThe moral of the story is to never let a bully intimidate you. Always fight back and defend yourself. Never allow the media, antifa thugs or punks on social media to intimidate you. Be a pit bull, not a Chihuahua.\n\nI've walked tall, with confidence, ever since. And I haven't been in a fight. Peace through strength. And one more lesson: Bullies are cowards. If you fight back, they will crumble.\n\nGreat story, right? I brought the house down.\n\nBut a Soros-funded liberal media group wrote a story in which it accused me of \"promoting violence.\" It turned a great All-American story of the nerd defeating bullies into a story of \"violence by conservatives.\" That's disgusting. That's fraud.\n\nBut it's instructive. This is what the liberal media and liberal politicians do to Trump every day. They are liars and bullies. They slander, intimidate, misrepresent and persecute. Their chief tool is propaganda.\n\nFrom this day forward, every time you see a negative story about Trump, remember my story.\n\nWayne Allyn Root is a CEO, entrepreneur, best-selling author, nationally syndicated talk show host on USA Radio Network and the host of \"The Wayne Allyn Root Show\" on Newsmax TV nightly at 8 p.m. ET.", "description": "I have to tell you a remarkable personal story, a .10/19/2019 6:37:01AM EST.", "authors": ["Wayne Allyn Root", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/1ae8ba40-ff26-4ff3-8f42-ceea942d7999.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
