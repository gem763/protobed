The vehicle had moved around stopped cars and had proceeded to go.\n\nA 2-year-old boy, named only as Ka\u2019Si, was shot in the stomach in a 'cowardly, violent, act' of apparent road rage in Baltimore early on Saturday morning\n\nPolice said Javon Johnson, 33, (pictured), was charged with attempted murder on Monday afternoon in connection with the shooting of the 2-year-old boy\n\nBut the driver who was in the first car stopped at the traffic lights then followed the child's grandmother and fired a bullet into the vehicle.\n\nThe incident happened in the 600 block of West Franklin Street around 12:30 Saturday morning.\n\nThe boy's mother, who said his name was Ka\u2019Si, shared a number of images of him with ABC7, including one showing the child in intensive care following the shooting.\n\nAccording to the outlet, Ka\u2019Si\u2019s mother posted on social media: 'I love you my boy. They shot my baby in the stomach because my mom blew the horn because they almost caused an accident. People really sick.'\n\nIn an update on the case on Monday afternoon, Baltimore Police said: 'Javon Johnson has been charged with attempted murder, assault, and various handgun related charges. He is currently being held at the Central Booking and Intake Facility.'\n\nIt is understood that Johnson lives in the Baltimore area and is believed to work as a male exotic dancer, according to social media.\n\nBaltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison had earlier called on the suspect to voluntarily surrender to authorities.\n\nThe boy's mother, who said his name was Ka\u2019Si, shared a number of images with ABC7 , including one showing the child in intensive care following the shooting\n\nThe boy remained in hospital on Monday afternoon and police said he is expected to survive. His grandmother was driving at the time of the apparent road-rage incident\n\nAt a press conference on Saturday, Harrison claimed: 'The driver of the vehicle where the victim was located blew the horn several times but none of the cars moved through the green light.\n\n'After blowing the horn several times during the green light cycle, the driver drove around the cars at the light and turned the corner.\n\n'What we believe is the driver of the first car at the light followed and caught up to the victim's vehicle and then fired from his car into the victim's vehicle striking the child.'\n\nHe added he knew that many in the community share his 'outrage' and described the suspect as a heavy set black man with dreadlocks.\n\nHarrison said a gray or silver minivan had caught up to the vehicle with the child and the driver fired his weapon.\n\nBaltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said the child was shot in the stomach and was immediately taken to hospital on Baltimore following the incident\n\nThe shooting incident happened in the 600 block of West Franklin Street, (pictured),around 12:30 Saturday morning\n\nHarrison had claimed: 'Whoever you are, please turn yourself in. You shot a child. Whoever you thought you were shooting at, you didn't shoot. You shot a child,' Harrison said.\n\n'Please turn yourself in. This is an act of road rage, this is a coward who fired out of his car into another car, indiscriminately. Not knowing who he would hit and there were other people in that car.'\n\n'But the two-year-old was shot and right now we need the help of anyone who knows anything or thinks they know something.'\n\nOfficers had responded to the area where the shooting happened around 12:30 am on Saturday after receiving an alert from the city's automatic gunshot detection system, but they did not locate a victim or suspect.\n\nPolice Commissioner Harrison says the boy is in a 'somewhat stable condition' and expected to survive. He remained in hospital on Monday afternoon\n\nA $15,000 reward was offered for information that led to an arrest over the child shooting\n\nHarrison said the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is offering a $15,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and that authorities are using \"every tool in the toolbox\" to identify the suspect.\n\nBaltimore, a once-thriving American seaport, has undeniable drug and violent crime challenges.\n\nIt saw some modest success in reducing its violent crime scourge in 2018, but still exceeded 300 annual homicides for the fourth year in a row.\n\nIn 2017, the 342 homicides in the city of roughly 612,000 inhabitants yielded a punishing homicide rate of 56 per 100,000 people, a rate the FBI called well above that of any other large U.S. city.\n\nHarrison said the boy's shooting is an example of the city's 'culture of violence' in which people want to settle their own disputes.\n\n'The decision to use the gun is not made when you use it; it is made when you walk away from home with it.\n\n'You've decided that if I need it, I'll use it. This is another example of that. We have to overcome people deciding to carry guns because when you carry guns, you'll use it when the time presents itself.'", "description": "A man, 33, was charged with attempted murder in Baltimore after a 2-year-old-boy was shot in the stomach in the early hours of Saturday morning during an apparent road rage incident.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Leah Mcdonald For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/22/19711386-0-image-a-99_1571088006182.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
