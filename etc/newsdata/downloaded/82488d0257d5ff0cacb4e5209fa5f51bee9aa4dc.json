To carry on a journey in which they\u2019ve risen from a three-time 100-loss club to a three-years-straight 100-win club with not just one, but two World Series titles in the space of those three seasons.\n\nFor the Nationals, the World Series presents an opportunity to complete a pretty compelling narrative in which they\u2019ve grown stronger as the year has gone on: from a near disastrous 19-31 start, to a late, come-from-behind victory in the Wild Card Game, to beating the favored Dodgers in the NLDS to simply dominating the Cardinals in the NLCS. The Nats are nobody\u2019s Cinderella, but a win over the Astros would certainly make them one of the more notable giant-killers in recent memory. And, of course, would give them their first World Series title in franchise history and the city of Washington its first World Series winner since the Senators won it in 1924.\n\nWe\u2019ll break down this Series in greater detail over the next couple of days, but for now it\u2019s worth noting that this matchup presents us with, arguably, the best possible group of starting pitchers in the game. Justin Verlander, Gerrit Cole, Zack Greinke, Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin are six of the top \u2014 what? \u2014 15 starting pitchers going right now? And An\u00edbal Sanchez has been pitching pretty dang good for Washington of late as well. Bullpenning is all the rage these days \u2014 and Houston\u2019s Game 6 win was a bullpen affair \u2014 but there is something classic and compelling about a handful of aces facing off in October.\n\nThe difference-maker could very well be an Astros offense that \u2014 last night\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Altuve walkoff blast notwithstanding \u2014 has, somehow, gone relatively quiet this postseason. Postseason pitching is always tough \u2014 and in beating the Rays and Yankees they faced two of the best bullpens going \u2014 but their collective 3.7 runs per game and .645 team OPS is very un-Astro-like. To beat the Nats, they\u2019ll definitely want to see those numbers go higher.\n\nFor Washington, it\u2019ll be about figuring out how to beat Gerrit Cole, Game 1\u2019s starter, and Justin Verlander, who will likely go in Game 2. They\u2019ll have to face each of those 20-game winners/Cy Young contenders twice if this series goes long. That seems daunting, but so too did climbing out of the hole they found themselves in in late May and beating the Dodgers in a five-game series. The Nats have dealt pretty well with \u201cdaunting\u201d thus year and, at the moment, they\u2019re playing their best baseball of the season.\n\nSo the stage is set. Washington vs. Houston in the 115th edition of the Fall Classic. Things get underway just after 8PM Eastern on Tuesday evening when Gerrit Cole fires in a near-100 m.p.h. fastball to Trea Turner. Stay with us over the next three days for our breakdown of what looks to be an epic matchup.\n\nFollow @craigcalcaterra", "description": "Which team will be hoisting the World Series trophy this season?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://nbchardballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1055765632-e1571571377508.jpg?w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
