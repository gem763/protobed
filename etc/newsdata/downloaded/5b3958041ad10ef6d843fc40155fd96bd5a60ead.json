He was tagged off the coast of Nova Scotia last year. (Ocearch/Twitter)\n\nThe non-profit research organization applied to tag 20 great white sharks off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in September and October 2018.\n\nThe process also involved a Seattle lobbying firm and the U.S. State Department.\n\nThe organization eventually got permission for its 2018 cruise where it captured and released seven great white sharks, all in Mahone Bay, N.S.\n\nIt has received permission to return to Canada this fall, including a permit to tag great white sharks inside St. Anns Bank, a marine protected area off Cape Breton.\n\nThis year, the evaluation was free of the drama and uncertainty that accompanied the inaugural expedition.\n\nHow Ocearch tags great whites\n\nOcearch uses chum and a trailing seal decoy to attract sharks and a hook and line to catch them. It removes the shark from the water for up to 20 minutes to bolt a satellite positioning tag onto its dorsal fin.\n\nOcearch says its approach, which covers the shark's eyes and hoses water through the gills, is actually safer than attaching tags with a harpoon.\n\nIt says blood samples taken immediately after capture and just prior to release show the sharks are not stressed.\n\nIn addition to taking multiple samples during the procedure, Ocearch also attaches acoustic tags.\n\nHowever, the smart position and temperature tracking tags are the star of the show, allowing the public to follow the sharks on Ocearch's shark tracker website and Twitter.\n\nIt also names the sharks it tags and gives them Twitter accounts.\n\nIn order to get into Canada, Ocearch needed two types of permits.\n\nBy May 1, 2018, it obtained Species at Risk Act licences allowing it to capture the endangered species off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.\n\nThe project ran into headwinds over the foreign fishing vessel research licence required to operate in Canadian waters.\n\n'This cruise will not be approved'\n\nThat is when V\u00e9zina stepped in.\n\nHe questioned whether Ocearch was duplicating a great white shark tagging program run by DFO scientists.\n\nDFO does not use chum, capture or remove the shark from the water, but uses a harpoon to attach an acoustic tag.\n\nWhile V\u00e9zina said the main tag type Ocearch uses is great for tracking, it provides \"no information on habitat use \u2014 as needed for [Species at Risk Act] research questions. Canadian scientists will not have access to the research data.\"\n\nAlain V\u00e9zina of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. (CBC)\n\nThroughout the vetting process, Ocearch defended the validity of its science and data sharing.\n\nStill, V\u00e9zina's misgivings rippled through the department, especially the licensing division, with one official asking: \"V\u00e9zina DOES NOT APPROVE. What do we do with this?\"\n\nThe day after V\u00e9zina's May 23 email, which concluded, \"I cannot recommend approval at this time,\" Charlene Cleveland, DFO's licence services officer, nixed the tagging operation.\n\n\"This cruise will not be approved, due to concerns from Science and Resource Management.\"\n\nIt was a temporary decision.\n\nCanada eventually issued the foreign fishing vessel permit in June with conditions, written by DFO, requiring Ocearch to copy and turn over all data collected during tagging and provide the department a final report.\n\nThose conditions were met, according to DFO.\n\nU.S. government, lobbyist pushed for expedition\n\nOcearch science director Robert Hueter was in constant contact with Canadian officials in 2018, urging approval and defending the credibility of Ocearch and its methods.\n\nThe American researchers enlisted a Seattle-based lobbying firm, Galvanize Partners, which in turn pushed the U.S. State Department to secure Canadian permission for the expedition.\n\nAs required by Canadian rules, the U.S. State Department submitted the application for Ocearch's foreign fishing vessel research licence.\n\nDr. Bob Hueter, chief scientific advisor for the Ocearch expedition, poses for a portrait aboard a ship off the coast of Lunenburg, N.S., in September 2018. (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Alison Auld)\n\nState Department official Allison Reed expressed frustration at the length of time Canada was taking, telling lobbyist Celes Eckerman: \"We've not encountered this situation in the time I've been covering these applications.\"\n\nReed later wrote to a Canadian counterpart at Global Affairs Canada.\n\n\"I believe we have submitted all required information you need for this [marine science research] cruise.\"\n\nMore issues arose once the Ocearch team and its specially outfitted ship arrived in Lunenburg, N.S., in September.\n\nDFO was concerned about chumming off Hirtles Beach, outside Lunenburg, and moved the fishing further from shore.\n\nOcearch successfully lobbied to amend its permit to allow it to tag sharks along the entire Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia to include Cape Breton.\n\nExpedition never left Mahone Bay\n\nIn the end, the expedition never left Mahone Bay.\n\nA second amendment it wanted generated far more discussion within DFO and open conflict with Ocearch.\n\nDFO initially refused an Ocearch request to allow it to put satellite tags on sharks that were smaller than the 3.5-metre minimum.\n\nDepartment biologists pointed to research showing great white shark dorsal fins are vulnerable to permanent damage if those tags are attached to sharks that have not matured.\n\nThe size requirement forced Ocearch to release a just under-the-line great white shark captured off Lunenburg in October without a satellite tracking tag.\n\n\"I know the fin on that animal was plenty large enough and nearing the end of its growth not to worry about the effects of a SPOT tag,\" Hueter wrote to species-at-risk biologist Jennifer MacDonald.\n\n\"I question the DFO scientists who called for the 3.5 minimum and challenge them to provide concrete evidence this restriction is anything but arbitrary.\"\n\nHueter said the restriction \"greatly hampers our knowledge and severely curtails our engagement with the public who follow this work on Shark Tracker. We'll be forced to explain to the public why we're not SPOT tagging the other large sharks,\" he said in an email to MacDonald.\n\nIn response, MacDonald notified her boss: \"There is some uncertainty with the supporting data and there are a number of broader considerations related to support from DFO science and risk of Ocearch publicly objecting to the results.\"\n\nIn the end, the permit was amended to allow Ocearch to attach satellite tags on three smaller sharks. The others had to be greater than 3.5 metres or have calcified claspers \u2014 an indicator of maturity in males.\n\nSmoother sailing in 2019\n\nThis year, DFO has issued the necessary permits to Ocearch for a Canadian cruise from Sept. 13 to Oct. 4, which will begin in Sydney and work south to Lunenburg.\n\nV\u00e9zina said the process has been much smoother this year with expectations laid out ahead of time in discussions.\n\nHe said what happened in 2018 was \"a vigorous internal debate in a department that deals with difficult issues.\"\n\nDFO said Ocearch declined to give it permission to release the 2019 permits, meaning they will be released only after an application under access to information laws.\n\nOcearch sent CBC News a statement saying, \"We found DFO's handling of our permits completely professional, extremely thorough, and conducted with the best interests of Canadian science and marine conservation in mind.\"\n\nIt said Ocearch found collaborators in Canada and the United States for its 2018 Nova Scotia expedition.\n\n\"While these applications were under review, Ocearch reached out repeatedly to the Canadian scientific community to invite participation and collaboration in this study. In the end we had several Canadian scientists participate in the 2018 expedition, including from DFO, from Environment and Climate Change Canada, and from the University of Windsor.\"\n\nIt said the trip provided data for 16 distinct research projects involving 25 principal investigators at 18 research institutions in North America.\n\nMORE TOP STORIES", "description": "Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans was initially prepared to veto a\u00a0great white shark tagging expedition off Nova Scotia last year because of concerns over the scientific value of the mission, CBC News has learned.", "authors": ["Paul Withers Is An Award-Winning Journalist Whose Career Started In The As A Cartoonist.
