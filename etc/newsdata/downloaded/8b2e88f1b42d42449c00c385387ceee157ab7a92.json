Two men hid behind seats. Some stayed for hours as gunmen fired round after round from high-caliber assault rifles.\n\n\"Where are you? I'm in Tres Rios, I'm hiding,\" a man said into his phone, checking frantically for news of his family.\n\nChildren huddled with mothers and families. Some had been forced by two armed men off a large white bus that was set on fire to block a road, sending black smoke spewing skywards.\n\nA police officer called his superiors to report that gunmen had removed him from his patrol car and torched it. Take off your uniform and blend in with civilians, his bosses told him.\n\nPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador defended his decision to free the younger Guzman, saying it saved lives. Still, authorities had reports of at least eight people killed.\n\nPARALYSIS\n\nNestled between fertile coastal strips that grow tomatoes for U.S. supermarkets, and mountain ranges home to marijuana and opium-growing outlaws, Culiacan lives a double life in the Sinaloa Cartel's heartland.\n\nBest known as home to legendary cartel bosses, the city also thrives as a regional economic hub where drug lords and their families live side by side with executives from agriculture businesses and other firms such as national retailer Coppel.\n\nOne of Mexico's most powerful gangs, the Sinaloa Cartel has kept a firm grip on the local drug trade despite the extradition of \"El Chapo\" to the United States in 2017, and cartel business has proceeded unabated under the leadership of his sons and their associates, security experts say.\n\nThough Culiacan has been roiled by spectacular raids such as the 2008 capture of a cousin of El Chapo and five other cartel members, Thursday's events went further.\n\n\"I've never seen a shootout paralyze all of Culiacan,\" said a 59-year-old businessman who has always lived in the city, raising his voice over the drone of helicopters circling above. He asked that his name not be used due to safety concerns.\n\n\"It's more or less normal to hear gunfire at night and early morning,\" he added. \"But like yesterday, never.\"\n\nJan-Albert Hootsen, the Mexico Representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists, was having lunch in Culiacan when the shooting erupted. Running to a nearby office for safety, he watched from the third floor as traffic melted away and was replaced by menacing convoys of cartel trucks.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, even as businesses began to reopen, a sense of unease still hung over Culiacan, Hootsen said.\n\n\"Some people in Mexico are wondering if the government has any kind of control over the situation,\" he said. \"I'm not sure they do.\"\n\n(Reporting by David Alire Garcia in Culiacan, Lizbeth Diaz and Miguel Angel Gutierrez in Mexico City; Additional reporting and writing by Daina Beth Solomon in Mexico City; Editing by Dave Graham and Daniel Wallis)", "description": "CULIACAN, Mexico/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Stunned residents of the Mexican city of Culiacan gingerly ventured back into the streets on Friday as police cleared away shell casings and scorched cars from an eruption of gangland violence on the home turf of the notorious Sinaloa Cartel.", "authors": ["David Alire Garcia"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
