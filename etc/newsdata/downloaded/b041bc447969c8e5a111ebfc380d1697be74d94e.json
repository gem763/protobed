Incidentally, U.S-China trade hopes have added 2,000 points to the Dow in just a few weeks, notes Slope of Hope blogger Tim Knight.\n\n\u201cI just want to quietly point out that the last time we went through this charade, it was all about the magical date December 3rd.

This as well as still depressed investor sentiment suggest that this rally still has legs,\u201d added Strobaek.\n\nAs for specifics, he likes global financials names partly due to the switching out lately from more defensive names to potentially better-returning cyclical ones such as banks that are tied to the economic cycle.\n\n\u201cWe think this rotation can continue, providing additional fuel to financial equities,\u201d Strobaek said.\n\nThe market\n\nU.S. stocks opened higher, with both the Dow DJIA, +0.24% and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.01% near record highs.\n\nGold GCZ19, -0.56% is up, while the dollar DXY, -0.11% and oil CLV19, -0.16% are down.\n\nEurope stocks SXXP, +0.34% continue to benefit from Thursday\u2019s ECB action, while Asia markets ADOW, +0.66% not closed for holidays affecting several other countries mostly advanced.\n\nThe tweet\n\nCount \u201cDraghilas\u201d we presume?
