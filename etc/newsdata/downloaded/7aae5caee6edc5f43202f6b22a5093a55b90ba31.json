A hot wind whistled through stands of decapitated pine trees and homes that collapsed during the most powerful hurricane in the northwestern Bahamas\u2019 recorded history.\n\nLoren Elliott / Reuters A member of the Bahamian military assesses damage in a destroyed neighborhood in the wake of Hurricane Dorian in Marsh Harbour, Great Abaco, Bahamas, September 7, 2019. (REUTERS/Loren Elliott)\n\nRescue teams were still trying to reach some Bahamian communities isolated by floodwaters and debris after the disaster that killed at least 43 people. Prime Minister Hubert Minnis says 35 people died on Abaco and eight on Grand Bahama island.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard said it has rescued a total of 290 people in the northern Bahamas following the hurricane. Six MH-60 Jayhawk helicopters and nine cutters are helping in the aid effort, the Coast Guard said.\n\nThe United Nations said eight tons of food supplies were on the way by ship. Some 14,700 ready-to-eat meals as well as logistical and telecommunications equipment are being delivered, said Herve Verhoosel, spokesman for the U.N. World Food Program.\n\n\u201cThe needs remain enormous,\u201d Verhoosel said.\n\nLoren Elliott / Reuters Residents wait at the airport in hopes of evacuating the island in the wake of Hurricane Dorian in Marsh Harbour, Great Abaco, Bahamas, September 7, 2019. (REUTERS/Loren Elliott)\n\nNo official figures were available, but much of the population of Marsh Harbour, home to most of the roughly 20,000 residents of Abaco, seemed to have already left. Many were staying with relatives in the capital, Nassau, others with family in Florida and other parts of the United States.\n\nIn Marsh Harbour\u2019s Murphy Town neighborhood, on a hill overlooking the azure sea, Jackson Blatch and his son-in-law were already rebuilding. In a blazing midday sun they stripped damaged shingles from Blatch\u2019s roofs and tossed them into his truck, parked below the eaves of a home he built by hand.\n\nLike a few other Abaco residents, Blatch is staying on an island pulverized by nature.\n\n\u201cEverybody says, \u2018Leave.\u2019 Leave and go where?\u201d Blatch asked. \u201cMy plan is to rebuild this island. I have a lot to offer.\u201d\n\nUnlike almost every other home on Abaco, Blatch\u2019s house had little damage. He is a builder who prides himself on quality work. When mixing concrete, he never skimps, always precisely blending the recommended amounts of cement, sand and gravel for floors, columns and ceilings.\n\nWhen he poured his walls and floors, he laced them thick with rebar, constructing a powerful skeleton that resisted the storm.\n\nInstead of using the manufacturer-provided clips on his hurricane shutters, he used long screws on as many as possible to fix the shutters tight to the window frame.\n\nWhen Dorian hit, it only managed to rip away the shutters with store-bought clips, and a few sections of shingles, leaving some of the Blatch family\u2019s possessions wet but the structure and furnishings intact.\n\nSo Blatch has power from a generator, drinking water, food and the help of his son-in-law, 25-year-old Moses Monestine.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a mortgage. I don\u2019t want to go to Nassau,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to the United States. I don\u2019t want to depend on anyone.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Hundreds of people who were displaced by Hurricane Dorian gather at a port that was turned into a distribution and evacuation center in Marsh Harbour, Bahamas on September 7, 2019.

Blocks and even entire neighborhoods are taken up by extended families \u2014 a cousin next door to a brother next door to a sister-in-law, forming instant support networks that went into action ahead of the storm.\n\nMany Abacoans work on ships or docks, others at the second homes that wealthy Americans have built throughout the long, curving island.\n\nBrian Russell, 55, is a marine engineer who has lived through three hurricanes on sea and many others on land.\n\nIn his home in the Dundas Town neighborhood, he has six months of drinking water and four months of water for bathing. He has a generator, and months of food.\n\nThe destruction doesn\u2019t deter him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me. Anywhere you go, life is what you make of it.\u201d\n\nOnce the water contaminated by the storm is clean, Russell said, he can live on fishing and gardening. His little garden of onion, tomato and banana plants was destroyed, but he plans to replant, and even add soursop, mango and sugar apple.\n\nOthers were more stuck than determined.\n\nSterling McKenzie, a 67-year-old retired equipment operator, is living in his sister\u2019s house with other relatives whose homes were destroyed. They are surviving on water and food donated by Bahamian officials and aid workers who pass by daily.\n\n\u201cWe might as well stay here and battle it out,\u201d he said. \u201cI ain\u2019t got no choice.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor more of AP\u2019s coverage of Hurricane Dorian, go to: https://apnews.com/Hurricanes", "description": "Rescue teams were still trying to reach some Bahamian communities isolated by floodwaters and debris after the disaster that killed at least 43 people.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d74faeb3b00004883d0c202.jpeg?cache=ok0uc8fy3y&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
