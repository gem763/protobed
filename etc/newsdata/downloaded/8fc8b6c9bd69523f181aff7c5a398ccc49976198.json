In that fight, Nick submitted Neer with a third-round kimura.\n\n\u201cJosh Neer \u2013 he\u2019s not in the UFC anymore \u2013 I fought him. He was the hardest fight I had,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cHe fought my brother two, three rounds, and they were just (expletive) squabbing. That\u2019s another guy in the category, too, and I knew fighting him that he was the man. He fought my bro, he was mad that Nick beat him, so he probably wanted to beat my (expletive) all over the place.\u201d\n\nDiaz and Neer engaged in an all-out battle and exchanged slams, dirty boxing in the clinch, and submission attempts. But Diaz was able to narrowly edge Neer.\n\n\u201cThat was the hardest fight because I\u2019m like, \u2018This fool\u2019s crazy, and he\u2019s not going to try and hold me,'\u201d Diaz said. \u201cI just tapped out four black belts or something, and in the UFC \u2013 like, good black belts. I was a purple belt. I was like, \u2018These fools are getting easier and easier.\u2019 I was like, \u2018This guy is probably a white belt. He\u2019s not even ranked in jiu-jitsu.\u2019 And back then, I was trying to get a black belt, so I knew. I was like, \u2018Man, this guy isn\u2019t even ranked \u2013 he\u2019s going to be hard and crazy, but at least he\u2019s probably just a white belt.\u2019 And I fought him and he was the hardest fight I had. Those black belts were easy compared to him.\n\n\u201cAnd it was a real good fight if you ever look back at that fight. It was a serious fight. We were fighting. I was going for the kill, he was going for the finish.\u201d", "description": "Nate Diaz reveals his hardest fight to date ahead of his UFC 244 headliner vs. Jorge Masvidal.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "John Morgan", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "George Garcia", "Dan Tom", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/usatsi_9494346.jpg?w=887&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
