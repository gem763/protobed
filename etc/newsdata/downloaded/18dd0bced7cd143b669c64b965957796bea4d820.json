The company said this was done \u201con a worst-case basis, assuming that the brand will not recover from the negative impact of the recall\u201d. Aspen is planning to relaunch the brand with a new formula in Australia.\n\nThe total revenue for Zantac in Australasia for the past year was R119 million \u2013 which represented 0.3% of Aspen\u2019s total revenue. It said the impact of the loss of Zantac on future earnings is not considered material.\n\nAspen has been battling a massive debt burden, with net borrowings reaching more than R53bn a couple of months ago.\n\nBut a deal that allowed it to sell its infant milk business helped to reduce its debt to around R40 billion by the end of June.", "description": "Aspen has the rights to Zantac in Australia, which is mostly sold as an over-the-counter medicine to treat heartburn, gastric reflux and ulcers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7598/a7779024ef0b4967a14e38ffa2d8edd8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
