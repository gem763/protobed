Some fans wear full-body shark costumes. There\u2019s even a little blue stuffed-animal shark that Parra placed in the netting in front of the home dugout at Nationals Park.\n\nAll of the zaniness could be on display for a global TV audience as the Fall Classic shifts to the nation\u2019s capital Friday night for Game 3, with Washington leading the best-of-seven series 2-0.\n\n\u201cIt kind of caught steam. \u2026 We all thought it was just going to be a game or two. Or a week. But it turned into something cool. Something to the get the fans involved,\u201d second baseman Brian Dozier said. \u201cIt was pretty cool to see in the playoffs. Everybody on their feet. He could have struck out or hit a homer and everyone would have been still clapping their hands.\u201d\n\nThe song reflects a loose and lively attitude many Nationals credit Parra with introducing when he was signed in May after the San Francisco Giants cut him. Plenty of players say that atmosphere has been key to Washington\u2019s turnaround from 19-31 that month to the sport\u2019s biggest stage now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still here in the World Series,\u201d Parra said, \u201cbecause we play together. We do anything together.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the dancing in the dugout after homers and behind closed doors after victories. The full-body embraces, including of Stephen Strasburg, who acknowledged, \u201cI\u2019m not much of a hugger, but they kind of just surround me. So I just have to take it.\u201d The sunglasses sported by Parra - with a rose-colored tint - and pitcher An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez - with yellow lenses - even during night games, a tradition that began in June.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have guys like Parra, An\u00edbal, Fernando (Rodney), these guys that have come here and changed the culture in the clubhouse,\u201d said reliever Sean Doolittle, naming three players new to the team in 2019, including two picked up during the season, \u201cand got a lot of guys in here to kind of loosen up and play the game with a little bit more fun, to be honest.\u201d\n\nSure, don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that important players were hurt early in the season and the Nationals are healthy as can be now.\n\nAnd, yes, having stud starters like Strasburg, Max Scherzer and Patrick Corbin, along with sluggers such as Juan Soto and Anthony Rendon, helped matters, of course.\n\nBut with the day-after-day schedule and the no-chance-to-get-away close quarters of a baseball clubhouse, it probably can\u2019t hurt for the 25 players on the active roster to enjoy each other\u2019s company and figure out ways to let certain losses dissipate amid some laughter.\n\n\u201cWe were going through a time where we were so tight, and we had all of these expectations, and in a way we weren\u2019t meeting them, and everybody was putting pressure on themselves and listening to all of the outside distractions going on,\u201d catcher Yan Gomes said, thinking back to being 12 games under .500. \u201cThen a couple of guys came in, and we decided to just kind of like drop this weight off our shoulders and just, in a way, dance like nobody\u2019s watching.\u201d\n\nNothing symbolizes that more than the silliness of \u201cBaby Shark,\u201d a children\u2019s song with billions of YouTube views that was created by a South Korean company - which is different from the wrong version Fox played during its broadcast of Washington\u2019s 12-3 win in Game 2.\n\nParra was trying to pick out a new walk-up song in June, when he was mired in an 0-for-22 slump, when he settled on this repetitive tune because he heard it \u201ca lot,\u201d thanks to his daughter.\n\nWho knew it would become the phenomenon it has, played recently at Redskins and Capitals games, too.\n\n\u201cPeople enjoy it. All their kids enjoy it,\u201d Parra said. \u201cSo I\u2019m happy for that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Stephen Hawkins in Houston contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The \"Baby Shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo\" earworm might just be coming to a World Series near you, if Washington Nationals backup outfielder Gerardo Parra heads to the plate during one of his team's home games against the Houston Astros.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/nlcs_cardinals_nationals_baseball_14114_c0-88-2084-1303_s1200x700.jpg?01aa8562ec0167f656bd0070925800e9a662b14f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
