The Gallup survey also showed more people believed Obama shared their values (53 percent) than Romney (45 percent).\n\nObama\u2019s biggest personal strength has been likability. Obama led Romney 81 percent to 64 percent in the Gallup survey.\n\nThe Hill poll\u2019s questions and methodology were different than Gallup\u2019s and can\u2019t be compared directly. But Obama can ill afford to lose any lead he\u2019s had over Romney on personal qualities and perceived leadership skills, Jillson said.\n\n\u201cI think of this as a race where Obama has very small advantages that he will have to struggle to maintain,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf [Romney] were able to tighten up that personal connection [with voters] it would certainly do him good. I think a challenger for president needs to be seen as competent, as right on some policies, and a guy I want in my living room for the next four years.\u201d\n\nWhile The Hill Poll found Romney matches Obama overall, it showed centrist voters \u2014 who may well decide the election \u2014 still favor the Democratic incumbent.\n\nForty-eight percent of centrist voters believe Obama is more honest and trustworthy, compared to 42 percent who cited Romney.\n\nFifty percent of centrists said Obama most shares their values while 36 percent said Romney. The poll also found 48 percent of centrists consider Obama the stronger leader, compared to 43 percent for Romney.\n\nThe Hill poll was conducted July 26 among 1,000 likely voters and has a 3 percentage point margin of error.\n\nClick here to view data from The Hill Poll.", "description": "Romney holds thin advantages over Obama on leadership, personal values and honesty, according to a new poll for The Hill.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "published_at": "2012-07-30"}
