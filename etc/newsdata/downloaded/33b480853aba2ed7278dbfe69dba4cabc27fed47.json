The plot is simple: in the 1960s an eccentric scientist builds an underground bunker, which he and his family retreat to during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Believing a nuclear apocalypse has happened, Fraser grows up underground and emerges 30 years later \u2013 with hilarious consequences.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t the plot that mesmerised me. It was the bunker. A Mid-Century underground palace, it featured a garden with a pool, a multi-roomed house, simulated sunlight and even a fake supermarket to pick up groceries. In short, it was a dream home for any nervous child who\u2019s watched Deep Impact too many times.\n\nNearly 60 years on from the Cuban Missile Crisis, fears about the end of the world are no less widespread. Rising sea levels, asteroids, nuclear war, a viral outbreak, rogue AI \u2013 you name it, it\u2019s coming to get us.\n\nThe huge number of zombie films and TV series confirms our obsession with the apocalypse \u2013 and what we\u2019d do if it happened. But preparing for the worst is no new thing. Bunkers have featured in the homes of ultra cautious folk for decades. However, 21st-century versions have taken things to the new levels.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Emma Cooke", "Content Editor", "Justin Francis", "Hattie Garlick"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/GettyImages-1052332886-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
