The company is offering the new rental plan in six states \u2014 Arizona, California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New Mexico \u2014 and it will cost as low as $50 per month (plus tax) with no upfront installation costs or long-term contract. The monthly payment also includes support, maintenance, and any \u201cother necessary hardware,\u201d though renters must pas any tax incentives or rebates to Tesla.\n\nThe new rental option launches just a few months after Tesla cut prices across the board on its solar panels. Taken together, the two decisions show how Tesla is trying to rejuvenate its home solar panel business, which has declined in the three years since the company acquired then-market-leader SolarCity. In July, Tesla announced that it deployed fewer solar panels in the second quarter of 2019 than in any other quarter since the SolarCity acquisition. The sales slump has now put Tesla behind two other residential solar companies.\n\nTesla\u2019s sales pitch for choosing the rental option is that it will be cheaper, quicker, and less burdensome for homeowners to get solar panels on their roof at the outset. The company promises a \u201cone click\u201d experience that\u2019s far simpler than the normal process, which Tesla says typically involves \u201clengthy consultations and piles of paperwork.\u201d\n\nTesla Solar just relaunched. Lmk what you think \u2026 https://t.co/mDoPO17YB9 \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 18, 2019\n\nIn every eligible state except for California, Tesla will charge $50 per month for a \u201csmall\u201d 3.8kW solar panel system that generates an average of 10 to 14kWh of energy per day, $100 per month for a \u201cmedium\u201d 7.6kW system that generates 19 to 28kWh, or $150 per month for a \u201clarge\u201d 11.4kW system that puts out 29 to 41kWh per day. (Whether solar panels are worth the cost for you is fairly subjective; the average US household used about 28kWh of electricity per day in 2017, according to the Energy Information Administration.)\n\nMonthly rates are higher in California; rentals will cost $65, $130, and $195 per month for small, medium, and large systems, respectively. It costs about $10,000, $20,000, and $30,000 to buy the small, medium, and large systems, respectively, from Tesla outright (installation included), depending on the state. (Tesla\u2019s Powerwall home battery still has to be bought separately and can\u2019t be added to the solar panel rental, the company says.)\n\nWhile the contract isn\u2019t long-term, there are some restrictions. Customers must own their home to have the panels installed. They can cancel the rental at any time, though they\u2019ll be charged a $1,500 removal fee, the entirety of which Tesla says will go toward the cost of uninstalling the panels. (\u201cTesla does not make a profit on this,\u201d the company writes.) Additionally, Tesla will impose the $1,500 fee if a homeowner decides to downgrade from one of the bigger systems to a smaller one. Owners can purchase the system outright five years after it\u2019s up and running, too, according to the agreement.\n\nRenting the panels will cost less upfront, but it\u2019s cheaper to own them long-term\n\nThe monthly rental rates can also be increased at any time, according to the language of the subscription agreement. Renters will have up to 30 days to accept the change or cancel their subscription.\n\nAs is the case with solar panel leasing plans (or more complicated \u201cpower purchase agreements\u201d), renters of Tesla\u2019s solar panels must pass \u201call tax credits, incentives, rebates, and certificates\u201d to the company. In Arizona, for example, this means Tesla stands to make between $4,021 and $10,063 per installation in combined federal and state tax incentives.\n\nThe federal tax credit for solar panels currently covers 30 percent of the total cost, though that incentive begins a multiyear phaseout starting on January 1st, 2020. But even without the federal tax credit, customers who have the money to buy Tesla\u2019s solar panel systems outright will ultimately spend less over the life of the panels. Depending on where they live and which system they buy, renters of Tesla\u2019s solar panels will wind up spending more than the outright purchase price after about 12 to 18 years of paying the monthly subscription fee (if it doesn\u2019t change).\n\nSolarCity used to offer a leasing plan for solar panels, which made it cheaper for homeowners to get rolling with home solar. But that was one of the features Tesla phased out after it acquired the company, and overall, solar panel sales have steadily declined in the years since. The company also closed installation centers and ended a deal with Home Depot in 2018, which helped market and sell its solar panels.\n\nTesla has spent the last few years touting a more futuristic (and more expensive) \u201cSolar Roof\u201d design, which involves replacing a whole roof with light-sensitive shingles. But the company is still stuck in the design and testing phase and has deployed a minimal amount of Solar Roofs. In the meantime, Tesla has built out a sizable commercial energy generation and storage business, which has helped balance out the revenue it lost as residential solar panel sales declined.\n\nUpdate August 19th, 5:45PM ET: Added information about the average US household\u2019s electricity use.", "description": "The new rental option is available in six states, and the subscription fee starts at $50 per month for a small system (including installation).
