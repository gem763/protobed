Time and again, people have used these images - sometimes to commemorate the occasion of Diwali and sometimes to establish Modi's 100% electrification of India.\n\nBut here we are, standing at a pedestal actually wondering if observing our country from the sky during the night could really tell us anything.\n\nEconomists Praveen Chakravarty and Vivek Dehejia have come out with a new theory based on an image grab that they took using satellites from the US Air Force Defence Meteorological Satellite Programme. These images show a clear-cut image of India, which was recorded by the satellite that circled the earth 14 times a day.\n\nFor those interested in the research that @pravchak & I are doing on spatial inequality in India, our headline finding is \"3-3-3\" -- the three richest large states have three times the per capita GDP of the three poorest large states -- an outlier amongst large federal zones. pic.twitter.com/hXl9y8BpC8 \u2014 Vivek Dehejia (@vdehejia) May 28, 2018\n\nThrough this unique data, they studied the income divergence of 387 of 640 districts in 12 states - districts that account for 85% of India's population and 80% of its GDP.\n\nDon't Miss\n\nThe data paints a gloomy picture of our country and states that India is growing more unequal day after day. Even though there is no economic activity during the night, the delicate tracery can be observed.\n\nIt is now, that the inequality in India is at its highest level in 92 years.\n\nFascinating: what looking at India from space, at night, teaches us! Most of India is dark at night because there is little economic activity going on. But lights seen from space also show that States are becoming more unequal between&within them: https://t.co/iMwrfkbzNv \u2014 Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) May 27, 2018\n\nOver 380 districts in 12 states were only a fifth as bright as the big cities of Mumbai and Bangalore. As many as 90% of all the districts are just a third as bright in the night as the top 10% of all districts, reports The Star.\n\nThe study states that these differences between people's income have only widened post-1991.\n\n\"By 2014, the economists found, the average person in the three richest states (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra) was three times as rich as the average person in the three poorest states (Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh),\" reports The Star.\n\nInequality in India can be seen from outer space https://t.co/JKlfHKwVBj pic.twitter.com/whedaIlPGw \u2014 The Star, Kenya (@TheStarKenya) May 27, 2018\n\n#Inequality in #India documented from outer space: From 1991 to 2014, the average person in 3 richest states (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra) became 3 times as rich as average person in 3 poorest states (Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh)https://t.co/2ysNLxg4sI pic.twitter.com/ZaeNQLtTnF \u2014 Assaad Razzouk (@AssaadRazzouk) May 27, 2018\n\n\"What we find is that both across states and across districts with each state, this is a wide, and widening disparity in economic activity. No, it is not that the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, but that the poor are not getting richer fast enough to close the gap with the already rich,\" says Dr Dehejia, a senior fellow at the Mumbai-based think tank IDFC Institute.\n\nThe blame has fallen on poor governance and the lack of adequate skills of jobs.", "description": "Economists Praveen Chakravarty and Vivek Dehejia have come out with a new theory based on image grab that they took by satellites from the US Air Force Defence Meteorological Satellite Programme.
