On Tuesday, the Asia-Pacific unit of brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (AB InBev) raised about $5 billion in a Hong Kong IPO, after being priced at the bottom of a marketed range. In July, the company cancelled plans for an IPO aiming to raise $9.8 billion.\n\nThe wider economy has also been hit. The Hong Kong Trade Development Council said on Monday that it expects Hong Kong\u2019s exports to shrink by 4% this year, in what would mark its worst export performance in a decade.\n\nLAWMAKER ATTACKED\n\nA democratic lawmaker, Roy Kwong, was taken to hospital on Tuesday after being punched and kicked by three men in the Tin Shui Wai district close to the border with mainland China.\n\nFellow Democratic Party lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting said the assailants had suspected triad, or organised criminal backgrounds, and intended \u201cto send a message to threaten all\u201d pro-democracy lawmakers.\n\nOver more than three months, many peaceful protests have degenerated into running battles between black-clad protesters and police, who have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets, bean bag rounds and several live rounds fired into the air.\n\nPolice, who have also been seen beating protesters on the ground with batons, say they have shown restraint in the face of increased violence, including protesters hurling petrol bombs.\n\nLam said she hoped a dialogue session on Thursday evening with 150 members of the public would help bridge the divide, but conceded \u201cit will be a long journey to achieve reconciliation in society.\u201d\n\nIn a direct challenge to Communist Party rulers in mainland China, some protesters have targeted Beijing\u2019s representative office in Hong Kong, thrown bricks outside the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army base and set fire to the Chinese flag.\n\nHong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam attends a news conference in Hong Kong, China September 24, 2019.
