He seems to be like a good wine and getting better with age. He's in his early 30's.\n\n'He's great around the group and we know how skilful he is as a player. He's not just good at 15's, he's played sevens in his time as well.\n\n'We're very lucky to have him in the form he's in. He was disappointed not to play against Fiji and we spoke about that.\n\n'We wanted to make a couple of changes and we're lucky to have the strength in depth we do in the loose forwards.\n\n'Part of the reason for that is we wanted some experience and quality in the loose forwards and that's why Justin is doing the job he is for us on Sunday.'", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN KUMAMOTO: Hallam Amos, Aled Davies, Ryan Elias Bradley Davies and Adam Beard all make first appearances in Japan - the latter having recovered from appendicitis.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/06/19573182-0-image-a-8_1570771779544.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
