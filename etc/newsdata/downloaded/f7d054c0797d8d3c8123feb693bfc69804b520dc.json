Keen to make a name in Britain, her UK publicist had all but begged me \u2013 then a showbusiness journalist for a red-top newspaper \u2013 to meet the actress for a drink.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019d never heard of Meghan or Suits, but reluctantly agreed \u2013 even though I\u2019d been rather looking forward to putting my feet up in front of the TV.\n\nBut here I was on a windswept November night in 2013 sharing a bottle of prosecco with Prince Harry\u2019s future wife, both of us shivering beneath an outdoor heater. It soon became clear that Meghan was determined to raise her profile \u2013 even if it was with an inconsequential 80-word piece tagged on to the end of my weekly column.\n\nWe got on well, so much so that she canvassed my opinion on whether she should go on a date with the footballer Ashley Cole who was then, as now, not exactly a man blessed with \u2018woke\u2019 sensibilities. All in all, she seemed grateful that I was helping. We even hugged.\n\nIt was with this in mind that I watched her interview with ITV\u2019s Tom Bradby last weekend. It might sound difficult to understand, she explained, but the forensic, unrelenting UK media attention came as a surprise. \u2018I had no idea,\u2019 she insisted.\n\nShe went on to tell Bradby that as an American she \u2018very naively\u2019 didn\u2019t know about tabloids and \u2018didn\u2019t get it\u2019.\n\nBack in 2013 we met at the Sanctum Soho, a five-star hotel popular with celebrities. I was greeted at 8pm by a woman with long, dark brown, wavy hair, wrapped up in a smart, but not particularly expensive-looking black winter coat, dark jeans and a pair of stiletto boots. She introduced herself as Meghan. Recalling how I had ruined a pair of cherished gold shoes at my 30th birthday party at the same venue two years earlier, I warned Meghan about getting her heels caught between the decking.\n\nWe sat at a corner table \u2013 thankfully beside a heater \u2013 and opposite a jacuzzi that we joked would receive little attention on such a chilly night. She struck me as pretty, but unremarkably so, until she flashed her transformative Hollywood smile. She was softly spoken, kind and eager to chat. Pouring me some of the venue\u2019s house prosecco into a plastic champagne flute, I sensed an eagerness to make me her friend.\n\nMeghan Markle as Rachel Zane in American TV drama Suits season four\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be unkind to say that my previous work with her UK publicist, Neil Ransome, had involved some less than stellar celebrities \u2013 far more likely to have appeared on Reality TV than Hollywood red carpets.\n\nDuring my years as a showbiz journalist, I\u2019ve been inundated with requests from agents and publicists to meet their \u2018new client\u2019 \u2013 all too often a desperado determined to have their 15 minutes of fame. Such meetings are often tiresome.\n\nPatrick J. Adams as Michael Ross, Meghan Markle as Rachel Zane in American TV drama Suits\n\nBut this client, Meghan, was not for giving up. In order to make that rooftop meeting happen, the persistent Mr Ransome contacted me several times, and, I later learned, had similarly pestered every other Fleet Street showbiz reporter. When I was obviously proving reluctant, he eventually resorted to getting a mutual friend, a former journalist turned publicist, to give me a nudge. She said we could go together, make a night of it and promised the prosecco would flow. Their determination \u2013 with or without Meghan\u2019s encouragement \u2013 to get me to a meeting was obvious.\n\nAt the time, I was the Showbusiness Editor and columnist for the Sunday People, a newspaper whose circulation and status put me a fair way down the pecking order of British tabloid journalists with whom an American star might wish to ingratiate themselves. But Meghan betrayed no hint of feeling short-changed that night.\n\nClearly, networking was something at which she excelled.\n\nEither she didn\u2019t realise she was doing it or \u2013 more likely in my view \u2013 she had it down to a fine art.\n\nAt the time, she just seemed like a normal woman. She wasn\u2019t starry, but polite and as interested in me as I was in her.\n\nWe spoke about her childhood in Los Angeles and she confided that she had recently been through a divorce from Hollywood movie producer Trevor Engelson.\n\nI recall her looking down as she spoke about how hard it was, but that it was for the best.\n\nHer mood brightened as we enjoyed another glass of fizz. After establishing we were the same age, we began to bond over how hard it is to find a boyfriend.\n\nWe moaned and swapped some war stories \u2013 hers mostly about her divorce \u2013 before she retrieved her iPhone 5 from her designer handbag. She looked somewhat pleased with herself, gleeful, hopeful. \u2018Do you know this guy, Ashley Cole?\u2019 she asked. \u2018He follows me on Twitter and keeps trying to talk to me. He\u2019s trying really hard.\u2019\n\nI knew Ashley only too well \u2013 both from meeting him in person a few times and from covering the twists and turns of his romance, marriage and divorce from the singer Cheryl Tweedy.\n\nThat night, as Meghan worked to secure coverage in a national newspaper, I saved her from the fate of becoming Mr Cole\u2019s girlfriend. Having spent much of my career reporting on the ups and mostly downs of his marriage to Cheryl, I felt it was the sisterly thing to do to pass on my plentiful knowledge of how he had repeatedly cheated on his wife. Following their split, several women came forward to tell their stories.\n\nMeghan speaking to Tom Bradby in the ITV documentary Harry & Meghan: An African Journey\n\nMeghan looked disappointed, giving me an inkling that she liked him, or at least the idea of him. At the time, the Chelsea and England star was hailed as the best left-back in the world and regular fodder for the tabloids. I can recall looking at her downcast face and feeling bad that I had crushed her dream of becoming a WAG.\n\nWe spent much of the remainder of the night talking about English men, how much she liked them and how much she loved London.\n\n'To be honest, I\u2019d never heard of Meghan or Suits, but reluctantly agreed \u2013 even though I\u2019d been rather looking forward to putting my feet up in front of the TV'\n\nShe was staying in Soho House, the members\u2019 club where her Canadian friend Markus Anderson works as a consultant. It is said that Anderson introduced Meghan to friends including Amal and George Clooney and Jessica Mulroney, who reportedly became her stylist.\n\nThe prosecco flowed until 11pm when Meghan called it a night. We said our goodbyes, exchanging more hugs as we wished one another luck with our respective hunts for The One.\n\nMy friend and I finished the third bottle of prosecco we\u2019d all started, and Meghan\u2019s grateful PR team picked up the tab. It was worth it for them and for her. Meghan got all of six inches in my gossip column (the story being Ashley\u2019s pursuit of her).\n\nBut her profile-raising efforts didn\u2019t end there.\n\nThe following week she was at it again, riding the publicity carousel in London for all she was worth. First she was pictured at a red-carpet event on the arm of an eligible male model \u2013 an old PR ruse designed to set tongues wagging.\n\nLater there was a charity gala dinner at which she helped hand out prizes. It was on this occasion that she reportedly asked TV personality and former WAG Lizzie Cundy: \u2018Do you know any famous guys? I\u2019m single and I really love English men.\u2019\n\nThe whistlestop London tour also involved attending the premiere of a film she had no part in.\n\nIt isn\u2019t easy to reconcile the Meghan who appeared so at ease talking candidly with a tabloid journalist she had never previously met with the Duchess on our screens last weekend who spoke of her hatred for the British tabloids. Had contempt hidden behind the hugs on that rooftop bar six years ago? Did her smiles really mask a snarl of disgust?\n\nOr is it that, as the Duchess of Sussex, she no longer needs the gossip column coverage that plain Meghan Markle once craved?", "description": "KATIE HIND: The Duchess of Sussex cut such a wounded figure as she spoke on TV last weekend, with her eyes wide and brimming with tears, it made me recall an evening spent with her.", "authors": ["Katie Hind Showbusiness Editor For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/22/20226520-0-image-a-14_1572124160152.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
