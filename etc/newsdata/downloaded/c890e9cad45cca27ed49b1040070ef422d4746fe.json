He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, after aides told him that his public suggestion of soldiers shooting migrants if they threw rocks was illegal, he backed down. But, he later suggested that they \u201cshoot migrants in the legs to slow them down.\u201d\n\n\"That\u2019s not allowed either, (staff) told him,\" according to the excerpt.\n\nThe article published Tuesday was adapted from \u201cBorder Wars: Inside Trump\u2019s Assault on Immigration,\u201d a book to be published on Oct. 8 by Times reporters Michael Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis.\n\nThe article is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House administration officials who were granted anonymity, describing a \"frenzied week of presidential rages\" that included \"around-the-clock staff panic and far more White House turmoil than was known at the time,\" according to the Times.\n\nAdding profanity, Trump shouted, \"You are making me look like an idiot! I ran on this. It's my issue,\u201d during a meeting that included White House Aide Stephen Miller, former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, then-Customs and Border Protection chief Kevin McAleenan, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, as well as presidential adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to the book excerpt.\n\nThe comments came around the same time the President publicly threatened to close the border, saying he would if \u201cMexico doesn\u2019t get with it.\" Trump later backed off from that threat.\n\n\u201cThe president was frustrated and I think he took that moment to hit the reset button,\u201d Thomas D. Homan, who served as Trump\u2019s acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the Times. \u201cThe president wanted it to be fixed quickly.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe book excerpt includes details that Trump \u201croutinely berated\u201d Nielsen as \u201cineffective and, worse \u2014 at least in his mind \u2014 not tough-looking enough.\"\n\nDuring a briefing over the necessity for new legal authority to bring down drones, Trump reportedly told Nielsen that she \u201cdidn\u2019t hear me the first time, honey. Shoot \u2019em down. Sweetheart, just shoot \u2019em out of the sky, OK?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe happiest [Trump] had been with [DHS Secretary] Nielsen was a few months earlier, when American border agents had fired tear gas into Mexico to try to stop migrants from crossing into the United States,\" the Times reported.\n\nThe cruelty has always been the point. https://t.co/DUSNwFR6W4 \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 1, 2019\n\nDemocrats were quick to express their outrage after the excerpt published.\n\nRep. Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez said that \u201ccruelty has always been the point,\u201d with the president. Rep. Eric Swalwell tweeted that Trump\u2019s actions usually fall \u201cinto one of three buckets: cruel, childish, or corrupt.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Border wall book details turbulent week of Donald Trump's directives", "description": "According to a book excerpt, President Trump shouted at staff during a March meeting, \u201cYou are making me look like an idiot!\"", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nSPsipZTpVZF7jBoJnBBGw--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTQ1MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/29e825a5e13c3bf0c642fc86e8992c36"}
