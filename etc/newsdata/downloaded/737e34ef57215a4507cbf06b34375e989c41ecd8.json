Versailles attracts millions of visitors each year who come to witness what is considered by many to be one of France's crowning achievements of art, design, and architecture. The massive and immaculate palace gardens are as much a draw as Versailles's ornate interiors.\n\nThe 680,000-square-foot palace consists of 2,300 rooms and houses many important collections of paintings and sculptures. Its most famous room is the Hall of Mirrors, a gilded gallery that documents France's 17th-century political victories through 30 paintings on the vaulted ceiling.\n\nAlas, the forthcoming Airelles Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles, Le Grand Contr\u00f4le hotel, the only hotel that will actually be inside the palace, will be a slightly pared down version. Airelles, part of the French firm LOV Group, has partnered with French chef Alain Ducasse to create a 14-room luxury hotel and gourmet restaurant in converted 17th- and 18th-century buildings on the palace grounds. Airelles has said that guests will be offered exclusive access and experiences at the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles, but did not provide specifics.\n\nThe design of the hotel, which is being led by architect and interior designer Christophe Tollemer, will pay homage to 18th-century style, and the property will benefit from views of the Orangery (an area of the gardens that houses several varieties of trees, including fruit trees) and the Pi\u00e8ce d'Eau des Suisses, the lake in the palace gardens.\n\nKirill Neiezhmakov/Shutterstock\n\n\"A stunning new house is soon to be unveiled in a setting steeped in history and situated just a stone's throw from Versailles' famous Hall of Mirrors and quintessentially French gardens,\" Airelles wrote on its site.\n\nLe Grand Contr\u00f4le will feature 14 rooms and suites, a wellness center, and an indoor swimming pool, according to Airelles.\n\nThe luxury hotel project is a long time coming, with reports of a planned hotel at Versailles dating as far back as 2011. In 2015, the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles put out a call for bids to take on the renovation of three 17th- and 18th-century buildings adjacent to the palace, as well as several other structures on the grounds, and convert them into a luxury hotel. Airelles ultimately won that bid.\n\nBookings for the Versailles hotel will open in December, but Airelles has not divulged what the rates will be. The company's hotel collection includes three other properties: Les Airelles, a renovation of the historic Austro-Hungarian Courchevel palace in France's Les Trois Vall\u00e9es ski region; La Bastide de Gordes, an 18th-century castle in Provence; and Mademoiselle Val d'Isere, a ski chalet in the French Alps.", "description": "French luxury hotel company Airelles has plans to open a collection of luxury rooms and suites in spring 2020 at the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles.", "authors": ["Michelle Baran"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4d33fcc4a0a332574f794?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
