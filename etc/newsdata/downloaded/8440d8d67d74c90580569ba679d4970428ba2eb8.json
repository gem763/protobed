The company\u2019s business centered on drumming up interest for clients by \u201cissuing its own cryptocurrency tokens as loyalty rewards\u201d for its products.\n\nHis partner at one company was Michael Hlady, a 47-year-old attorney who allegedly posed in his business dealings as \u201cMichael Peters.\u201d According to the complaint, Hlady claimed to have deposed a head of state and killed others in the course of his work for the U.S. military, Irish Republican Army, FBI, CIA, and NSA.\n\nNerayoff made a demand of his client in March 2018, nine months after their first meeting\u2014a loan of 10,000 Ethereum tokens, worth $4.45 million, that he would never pay back, according to the complaint. He allegedly introduced Hlady to the two owners of Company 1 as the president of Alchemist, describing him as a high-powered former government agent licensed to carry firearms through airports.\n\nOn March 20, 2018, the startup owners visited Nerayoff\u2019s home in Great Neck, New York, the complaint reads, and Hlady was there as well. Because a snowstorm delayed her flight out, one company owner stayed overnight, according to the complaint.\n\nIn the middle of the night, the complaint alleges, Hlady walked into her room, pulled a chair up to the side of her bed, threatened to destroy her company, and demanded $10 million. Nerayoff later joined them and reiterated the threat, according to the complaint, again demanding the $4.45 million in Ether. The company transferred the money shortly after, the suit reads, and Nerayoff never paid it back.\n\nBoth Nerayoff and Hlady are charged with extortion, and both have been arrested. Nerayoff has been released on a $750,000 bond, and Hlady, who was first taken into custody in Rhode Island, was ordered to appear in Providence federal court Wednesday afternoon, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. If convicted, they face 20 years in prison apiece.\n\n\u201cAs alleged, Nerayoff and Hlady carried out an old-fashioned shakedown, to be paid off with 21st century cryptocurrency,\u201d U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue said in a press release.\n\nNerayoff\u2019s lawyer Avi Moskowitz denied the allegations to The Daily Beast, saying: \u201cThe alleged victims owed my clients a lot of money, and they used the criminal process to get out of paying it. We are confident that Mr. Nerayoff will be vindicated at trial.\u201d Hlady could not be reached for comment.\n\nNerayoff first took on the startup as a client in July 2017 to assist with its fundraising and initial coin offering (ICO), a sale of digital tokens on the blockchain that represent a stake in a company. New and unregulated, ICOs have in the past attracted digital con artists and those in search of get-rich-quick schemes. The terms of their original agreement stated that Nerayoff would keep 22.5 percent of the money raised through the ICO, which people bought into using the cryptocurrency Ethereum. One Ether (ETH) was worth between $185 and $255 at the time.\n\nNerayoff wasn\u2019t satisfied with the terms, though, so he allegedly held his client\u2019s money hostage. He raised $16.24 million worth of Ether tokens before the ICO began on Nov. 7, 2017, entitling him to $3.78 million in Ether, according the original agreement described in the complaint, which the company paid. However, in the week before the sale started, Nerayoff and an unnamed co-conspirator began threatening to sabotage the offering and \u201cdestroy\u201d the company unless it paid him $8.75 million in Ether, the complaint alleges.\n\nNerayoff allegedly gave the company an ultimatum: sign two clandestine agreements or he would keep all the presale money. The two owners of Company 1, identified in the complaint only as John and Jane Doe, signed the night before the ICO started.\n\nUnder the terms of one agreement, the company would pay Nerayoff more money if he raised more for its ICO, some in Ether and some in the company\u2019s own tokens. The second agreement descended even further into extortion, the complaint alleges. The contract allegedly demanded that Nerayoff\u2019s clients transfer another $8.75 million in Ether to SDN, a company Nerayoff owned, regardless of his fundraising efforts. The complaint doesn\u2019t specify if the company complied.\n\nBoth contracts stipulated the clients could not disclose the existence or the terms of the contracts to any third parties, the complaint alleges.\n\nNerayoff and Hlady allegedly continued to threaten the owners of the company for months. Nerayoff informed Jane Doe he knew where her child lived, according to the complaint. Hlady\u2019s threats once even tracked to his flight times, according to the suit. He was boarding a flight at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy Airport in late March 2018 when he demanded the owners send the loan by the time he landed or \u201cI promise I will destroy your company,\u201d he texted, according to the complaint.", "description": "Steven Nerayoff and Michael Hlady allegedly shook down a startup with midnight threats to destroy the company if it did not pay them more, according to a newly unsealed complaint.", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568866249/190917-montgomery-currency-tease_g50qpv", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
