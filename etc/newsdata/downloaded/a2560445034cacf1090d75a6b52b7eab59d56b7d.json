Some were simply accessories, but mostly, they sent a message. She had a pair of doves for peaceful days and a green snake for others.\n\nThe day she confronted Vladimir Putin over Russia\u2019s involvement in MH17 \u2013 a \u201cdiplomatic buttonholing\u201d (in her words) as opposed to Tony Abbott\u2019s threatened \u201cshirtfronting\u201d \u2013 she wore a brooch that showed the planets aligning. Or maybe colliding; she can\u2019t quite remember. \u201cIf there\u2019s an opportunity to pay a compliment through your clothes, you should,\u201d says Bishop, over lunch in the hotel room at the COMO.\n\n\u201cDorothy-red stilettos against a sea of men\u2019s dark shoes\u201d: Bishop\u2019s shoes made a statement when she announced her resignation as foreign affairs minister in August, 2018. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nCompliments, sure. But what of that white dress she wore on the day in February when she announced she would not re-contest her seat in Federal Parliament? Just two weeks earlier, Democratic congresswomen in the US colour-blocked themselves in white, to represent women\u2019s suffrage, for Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address. Was her white dress, by American designer Ted Baker, with a feminine flower sash across the front, a nod to suffrage, too? \u201cThat\u2019s looking too much into it,\u201d she says swiftly.\n\nBut there was, she concedes, a statement in the shoes she wore when, in August last year, she stepped down as foreign minister: \u201cI\u2019m outta here.\u201d Those red pumps were brand new when Alex Ellinghausen, chief photographer in Parliament for The Australian Financial Review, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, took the now-famous image of them: Dorothy-red stilettos, embellished with red crystals, against a sea of men\u2019s dark shoes.\n\n\u201cI had no idea how the photo would take off,\u201d Bishop says. At one point, the shoes had their own Instagram page: proof, she says, of the power of fashion.\n\nThey now sit in the Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House in Canberra, alongside the Akubra worn by the late Tim Fischer and John Howard\u2019s tracksuit. \u201cI\u2019m told they\u2019ve been so popular they\u2019ll be keeping them.\u201d Which is a shame, Bishop adds, because she only got to wear them once.\n\nBishop's blue sequinned Rachel Gilbert gown created a stir in the House of Representatives during the budget speech in April, 2019. Dominic Lorrimer\n\nPerhaps her most memorable moment of fashion colliding with politics came in April, when she sat as a backbencher for the first time in 16 years, having announced she was quitting politics, to hear newly minted Treasurer Josh Frydenberg give his inaugural budget speech. Bishop roundly stole the show wearing a form-fitting royal blue gown, entirely covered in sequins, designed by Rachel Gilbert.\n\nThe Liberal Party had endured months of talk of having a \u201cwoman problem\u201d. Bishop had picked an outfit \u2013 in Liberal blue, of course \u2013 that meant no one could overlook the woman sitting in the back row who might have been prime minister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat same night, over in Sydney, designer Rachel Gilbert\u2019s phone was \u201cblowing up\u201d. Gilbert had no idea what was happening. She checked her messages. \u201cThey all said something like, \u2018Julie\u2019s wearing your dress!\u2019 I thought, Julie? What dress?\u201d She turned on the TV. There was Julie Bishop, on her last budget night as a federal politician, wearing a vivid blue cocktail frock that put all eyes firmly on her. \u201cIt was pretty incredible to see,\u201d says Gilbert. \u201cThe dress sold out after that.\u201d\n\nBishop is one of Gilbert\u2019s most loyal customers, coming in to Gilbert\u2019s head office as often as every fortnight to loan and purchase clothes. \u201cOften I won\u2019t even know that she\u2019s come in,\u201d says Gilbert, \u201cuntil I see a photo of her sitting next to Amal Clooney at a dinner in New York or something, and there she is, in one of my dresses.\n\nShe was the first politician here to take fashion seriously, as a billion-dollar industry. \u2014 Edwina McCann, 'Vogue' editor-in-chief\n\n\u201cYou can put a model in something but when a person of Julie\u2019s renown chooses it themselves, and wears it on the world stage \u2026 there is just no competing with that.\u201d\n\nAnd here is a key reason why the fashion pack loves Julie just as much as she loves fashion: to use an industry expression, Bishop moves merch.\n\nToni Maticevski gown, $2550; Kailis 40th Anniversary Blue Collection earrings, $26,000, ring, $28,995, and cuff $19,200; watch, Bishop\u2019s own. Stef King\n\nWhen she was named by Tony Abbott as foreign affairs minister in 2013, Bishop appointed herself something of an unofficial clotheshorse for Australian designers, wearing their creations often when overseas. (\u201cPeople are surprised to hear we have such a robust fashion industry,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich is exactly why I do it.\u201d) Some saw a federal politician posing with fashion designers and celebrities at glittering events, earning her the nickname Minister for Fashion. And yes, that label is one she\u2019s fine with.\n\n\u201cShe was the first politician here to take fashion seriously, as a billion-dollar industry,\u201d says Bishop\u2019s friend, Vogue editor-in-chief Edwina McCann, referring to fashion\u2019s share of the retail sector, as well as the manufacturing of textiles, clothing and footwear, worth $25 billion annually. \u201cFor so long fashion was relegated to the women\u2019s pages \u2013 I mean, it still is \u2013 but, in fact, it is this huge industry which has a real impact on our economy.\u201d\n\nBishop said so in a speech to formalise the relationship between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the Australian Fashion Council, a moment McCann describes as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d. It had echoes of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s comment to the BBC World Service in 1984 that fashion \u201cneeds to be seen to have government support \u2013 it is big business \u2026 It has repercussions for many, many other industries.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBishop and McCann met when McCann was attempting to merge two separate industry bodies into one overarching advisory council, something akin to the British Fashion Council, which promotes British designers and retail. Eventually this became the Australian Fashion Council.\n\n\u201cOur designers needed to be better represented, so I reached out to Julie,\u201d says McCann. \u201cWe have real problems: not just things like the retail market being challenged, but issues like sustainability and labour. I didn\u2019t expect to hear back, but I did, right away.\u201d\n\nCarla Zampatti top, $549, and pants, $549; Kailis Royal Meridian ring, $8900, necklace, $88,000 and drop earrings, $33,000; Badgley Mischka heels and watch, Bishop\u2019s own. Stef King\n\nMcCann invited Bishop to a meeting to discuss government support of the fashion industry. \u201cShe came in knowing all the facts and had this very clear vision around fashion diplomacy. Everyone was blown away.\u201d\n\n\u201cFashion diplomacy\u201d was a hashtag Bishop often deployed in her social media posts about the fashion industry. Fashion diplomacy can take different forms, but for Bishop it meant wearing Australian designers to promote the industry, using her clothing to make a point, and inviting designers and industry insiders to participate in cultural exchanges.\n\nI speak to young designers who are so grateful when she speaks about them or wears one of their pieces. \u2014 David Giles-Kaye, Australian Fashion Council\n\nGenerally, these posts were met with ire, particularly on Twitter. Replies ranged from insinuating that Bishop received free samples from designers to suggestions she get back to work. But for Bishop, this was work.\n\nDavid Giles-Kaye, who currently leads the Australian Fashion Council, says Bishop\u2019s support has been crucial. As retail struggles and young designers are challenged, having a force like Bishop promote homegrown fashion is \u201cindescribably powerful\u201d.\n\n\u201cI speak to young designers who are so grateful when she speaks about them or wears one of their pieces,\u201d says Giles-Kaye. \u201cIt can take 10 years for a designer to break through. That support helps like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\nMcCann puts it another way. \u201cThere are influencers, and there are people with real influence. And Julie has real influence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first piece of clothing Bishop ever fell in love with was a pink lace-and-tulle ballgown worn by her mother. \u201cShe and my godmother made it together,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember watching them make the whole thing, every stitch. When it was finished and my mother tried it on, I cried. It was the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d Bishop was three.\n\nHer mother Isabel, who Bishop has often described as her best friend, made most of the clothing she and her siblings wore. They would travel from their home in the Adelaide Hills to the city, where her mother would buy patterns and Bishop and her siblings would find the fabric. As the youngest of three girls, Bishop soon grew tired of wearing hand-me-downs.\n\nMeraki cutaway gown, $855; earrings, cuff and Versace heels, Bishop\u2019s own. Stef King\n\n\u201cI told my parents I\u2019d go work in the orchard,\u201d she says, referring to her parents\u2019 cherry farm, \u201cand I had this idea that I\u2019d save up all my money to buy something from David Jones.\u201d She was about 10 when she made her first purchase \u2013 \u201ccanary yellow bathers and a brown and white skivvy. Horrendous.\u201d\n\nAs a lawyer \u2013 through most of the 1990s she was managing partner at Clayton Utz in Perth \u2013 she wore loads of Hugo Boss and Armani. For her maiden speech to Parliament in 1998 she wore a pale blue cashmere jacket by Escada \u2013 the colour, of course, being a nod to her party. But after being appointed by John Howard as minister for aged care in 2003, she swapped the power suits for cardigans and knee-length skirts.\n\n\u201cOne of the prime minister\u2019s senior advisers rang me and said, \u2018Julie, take this the right way, but forget the Armani suits and forget the corporate look,\u2019\u201d she told Mia Freedman on her Mamamia podcast in April. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re the minister for ageing, you\u2019re going into aged-care homes; you\u2019ve got to dress appropriately.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe later learnt to dress exactly as she wanted. \u201cYou can\u2019t please everyone,\u201d she says now, matter-of-factly, \u201cnor should you try to.\u201d Back came the tailored corporate suits, in standard navy and black, but also red gingham, mauve satin and pink jacquard. Her collars started to fold upwards. It was when the Coalition was returned to office in 2013, and when she was appointed as foreign minister, that she really stepped things up.\n\n\u201cWhen I became foreign minister, I felt there was more we could do to boost Australia\u2019s exports,\u201d she says. \u201cThe focus, to me, was very much on energy resources, agriculture and increasingly, financial services. But I felt that an element of economic diplomacy that was missing was our creative industries, and in particular, fashion.\u201d\n\nThe enthusiasm she felt as a young girl had never waned; working with the fashion industry, with whom she already had many contacts, especially with West Australian pearl jewellers, was a natural fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs she grew into the role of foreign minister, her wardrobe seemed to become ever bolder. Bishop increasingly dressed as if she was about to be photographed next to Hugh Jackman (which, to be fair, was sometimes the case).\n\nBishop with her partner David Panton at the 2017 Midwinter Ball in Canberra. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nShe wore Rachel Gilbert, Meraki, Bec + Bridge, Kym Ellery, Dion Lee and Bianca Spender \u2013 though not, it should be noted, Spender\u2019s mother and Bishop\u2019s friend Carla Zampatti. The only \u201cdecent\u201d clothing store in Canberra, Bishop says, is Zampatti\u2019s \u2013 \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to turn up to Parliament in the same outfit as Michaelia Cash,\u201d she says, dry as sandpaper.\n\nHer outfits, her love of a red carpet, her regular appearances at events such as Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, the Sydney Children\u2019s Hospitals Foundation Gold Dinner and the Australian Open (this year, next to another fashion maven, Anna Wintour) earned her another nickname: \u201cHollywood.\u201d\n\nShe laughs it off and the idea that she advocated for the fashion industry to curry favour with designers. \u201cAustralia punches far above its weight when it comes to fashion,\u201d she says, \u201cand I felt it was high time to celebrate that. You look at someone like Collette Dinnigan, the first Australian to be invited to show at Paris Couture Week. If that was a sportsperson, achieving something like that in an athletic pursuit, you would never stop hearing about it in Australia.\u201d She pauses. \u201cFashion diplomacy was about recognising the extraordinary talent we have here, but also the vast economic potential that it has.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a sampling of what Bishop did behind the scenes to boost Australia\u2019s fashion industry: she arranged for Australian resort wear designers to show at Sao Paulo Fashion Week, the largest in South America and the world\u2019s fifth-largest after New York, London, Paris and Milan. She got Australian designers such as Romance Was Born to show at India Fashion Week.\n\nShe created cultural diplomacy grants, allowing designers to travel, study and undertake traineeships. She worked with the Indonesian embassy to host Australian designers there, allowing them to break into that lucrative market. In 2015 she signed a memorandum of understanding between DFAT and the Australian Fashion Council to identify areas where they could work together to promote Australian fashion globally.\n\nShe worked with The Woolmark Company to promote Australian wool as an activewear fabric, now a huge growth area here and overseas. Oh, and when she wears something, it frequently sells out, as Gilbert can attest.\n\nOf course, fashion diplomacy was much more than promoting Australian designers (and Bishop didn\u2019t always wear homegrown design; Hugo Boss and Armani are still on high rotation) \u2013 it was making a point about what Bishop wanted to say. And in that regard, she\u2019s far from being the first.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1953, Jackie Kennedy Onassis wore a wedding dress by little-known designer Anne Lowe \u2013 who was African-American \u2013 in an early nod to the civil rights movement her husband would later champion.\n\nBishop on her morning run into Parliament House: she has promoted Australian wool as an activewear fabric. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nPrincess Diana, on the night of a documentary being broadcast on TV in which Prince Charles admitted to having an affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles, wore a sexed-up off-the-shoulder number that quickly became known as the \u201crevenge dress\u201d.\n\nToday, the Duchesses of Cambridge and Sussex frequently pay homage to Diana\u2019s style \u2013 the former, for instance, wearing a blue Jenny Packham dress when introducing baby George to the world in 2013, echoing Diana\u2019s outfit after Prince William\u2019s birth in 1982.\n\nBut it\u2019s one thing for a woman with symbolic power to use their style as iconography. It\u2019s quite another for a woman with real power to do it. Madeleine Albright, as US Secretary of State, carefully selected pins to convey messages to opponents, allies and the media, but otherwise she wore somewhat fusty suits. We might be getting used to women in power, but are we ready for a woman in blue sequins?\n\nIt was very powerful for Australian women to see a woman like Julie loving fashion as much as she does. \u2014 Edwina McCann, 'Vogue' editor-in-chief\n\nFew women on the political stage \u2013 not Hillary Rodham Clinton and her pant suits, nor Angela Merkel and her boxy jackets \u2013 have embraced fashion as fully and comfortably as Bishop has. Which is curious, really: Bishop, who tired quickly of repeatedly being asked if she was a feminist (to which her answer was always no), made an extremely pointed feminist case with her clothing \u2013 that a woman does not need to dress like a man to exist in a man\u2019s world, and that a woman can wield an enormous amount of political and economic power and also look exactly the way she wants to.\n\nEdwina McCann says the reaction to Bishop\u2019s love of fashion and her support of the industry is \u201chard to see as anything but misogynist\u201d. Paul Keating loved his Zegna suits, and while it may have invited criticism, it was generally along class lines, not gender.\n\nDavid Giles-Kaye agrees. \u201cThe industry is seen as female-dominated and I think it is often dismissed or undervalued because of that. And that is a real shame.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, of course, there must have been people who appreciated Bishop\u2019s fashion diplomacy model. Who else was buying all those Rachel Gilbert dresses?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was very powerful for Australian women to see a woman like Julie loving fashion as much as she does,\u201d says McCann. \u201cIt sent a message that you can be a serious person doing serious things and also have pride in your appearance and a love of beautiful things. And by person, I mean \u2018woman\u2019.\u201d\n\nBishop herself won\u2019t be drawn \u2013 much \u2013 on questions of sexism in our interview, saying only that male politicians are not generally taken to task for their appearance because they wear the same thing every day. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to go wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cAlthough some do, desperately,\u201d she adds after a beat.\n\nThis is an industry that contributes billions to our economy each year. And we all participate in it. We all wear clothes. \u2014 Julie Bishop\n\nEver the diplomat, she won\u2019t choose a best-dressed Australian politician, though she does think Melania Trump \u201crepresents the United States beautifully\u201d. What did she make of the coat she wore to visit immigrant children, with \u201cI don\u2019t really care, do you?\u201d emblazoned on the back? \u201cIt was bizarre,\u201d Bishop concedes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she was trying to say.\u201d\n\nWould another foreign minister have made fashion a policy choice? \u201cIt has been put to me that a male foreign minister wouldn\u2019t have pursued it,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether that is right, but until my assumption of the role, it hadn\u2019t been a focus.\u201d Will Marise Payne take up the mantle? She pauses ever so slightly before pursing her lips and giving a pointed look: no. Does the criticism ever get her down? The idea that a woman can be serious and love not-so-serious things?\n\n\u201cThe criticism is borne of ignorance,\u201d she says. \u201cFashion is actually very serious, whether you want to believe that or not. There were some who sought to trivialise it and criticise me, but in doing that they overlooked the fact that this is an industry that contributes billions to our economy each year. And we all participate in it. We all wear clothes.\u201d\n\nThese days, Bishop literally wears a different hat: next year she will become the first female chancellor of the Australian National University. In the meantime, she\u2019s wearing more yoga pants and jeans than ever before. She still loves dressing up, though, and believes strongly in the transformative power of fashion.\n\n\u201cYou put on an outfit that\u2019s right for the moment,\u201d she says, \u201cand you feel you can take on the world.\u201d Or at least Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe heritage issue of LUXURY is out on Friday, September 6 inside The Australian Financial Review.
