Pat Toomey, left, is lobbying Republicans to support a new version of a background check bill he wrote with Sen. Joe Manchin, right, in 2013. | Allison Shelley/Getty Images Congress Senators make last-ditch plea to Trump on guns Trump could message what kind of gun control package he\u2019d support by as early as Thursday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump spoke for 40 minutes with three leading senators Wednesday about expanding background checks during gun sales, keeping alive the Senate\u2019s long-running gun negotiations with the White House for at least one more day.\n\nTrump is expected to be briefed on Thursday by White House officials on his options, according to two GOP officials familiar with the matter. And Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said Trump could signal to the Hill what package he could support as soon as Thursday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe senators described Trump as engaged and inquisitive on the speakerphone with them as they made a last-ditch bid to get the president to support expanding background checks to cover private sellers on the internet, advertisements and gun shows. Trump has been reluctant to commit to any specific piece of legislation, but the senators said he\u2019s doing enough to keep their hopes alive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know hopefully by tomorrow if there\u2019s something, we can agree on, and once we agree on something we\u2019re going to hold to it and fight for it,\u201d Manchin said. Trump \u201ccan support something we all can agree on is what I took out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the witching hour and we\u2019ll know soon within the next day or two about whether the White House is willing to put a substantive background checks bill on the table,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nBut Toomey, who is lobbying reluctant members of his own party to support a new version of legislation he wrote with Manchin in 2013, was more cautious on both the timeline and the president\u2019s stance. Trump said they are \u201cgoing to take a look at a lot of different things.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did not make a commitment to support any particular bill or any particular thing, but he did strongly convey an interest in doing something meaningful,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cThere was a discussion about having a step forward one way or another tomorrow but that\u2019s not carved in stone.\u201d\n\nMike Braun (R-Ind.), one of the new senators whom Toomey is courting, said Wednesday he\u2019s willing to lobby Trump for tighter background checks and red flags and \u201canything that\u2019s not going to impact a law-abiding citizen.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

John Cornyn (R-Texas) said he expects something this week, but a White House official insisted no date had been selected for the rollout of gun legislation and no decision had been made on when the proposal would come out.\n\nThe confusion over the timeline only further muddled what\u2019s been a wide-ranging debate that has yet to make any concrete progress. Trump met with the top GOP congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday afternoon, but although firearm legislation was discussed, neither firm policy nor rollout dates were decided upon.\n\n\u201cWhen that happens, I\u2019m not sure. They were driving toward the end of the week,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Thune , who attended the meeting. \u201cThere is an amount of inertia toward trying to get to a plan, but I don\u2019t want to make any guarantees about when it comes.\u201d\n\nWhile other senators like Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) are working on providing grants for states to expand \"red flag\" laws and Susan Collins (R-Maine) has legislation to crackdown on straw purchasers, the group of three senators made clear to the president that any package should center around background checks.\n\n\u201cWe all agree people in those categories should not have firearms. This is a commonsense way to make it much more difficult for those folks to get it. That\u2019s the case that I made to the president,\u201d Toomey said of the conversation. Officials from the Justice Department were also on the call, senators said.\n\nRepublicans have been loath to expand background checks in previous attempts, and just Toomey and Collins remain as GOP supporters of the background checks bill from 2013. But members of both parties see an opportunity for Trump to take the lead and push a bill past the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold -- and potentially reinvigorate a debate that\u2019s fallen along partisan lines for years.\n\n\u201cIf this is a compromise, it\u2019s going to be a compromise. It\u2019s going to have some Republican \u2018no\u2019 votes and some Democratic \u2018no\u2019 votes,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIf I end up agreeing to something that\u2019s not \u2026 universal background checks, that\u2019s going to be a heavy lift on the Democratic side.\u201d\n\nThe House has passed a universal background checks bill but the proposal being discussed is narrower, offering more exemptions for friends and family to do gun sales with no background check.\n\nAnita Kumar contributed to this report.", "description": "Trump could message what kind of gun control package he\u2019d support by as early as Thursday. <br />", "authors": ["Burgess Everett", "Marianne Levine"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/52/77/26058c154e4fba696da3eb483399/190911-toomey-manchin-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
