Trump says \"some\" congressional leaders were notified of raid.\n\n\n\n\"We were going to notify them last night, but we decided not to do that, because Washington leaks like I've never seen before...Washington is a leaking machine.\" https://t.co/Kz60vph0Kk pic.twitter.com/uT1VpsRF7f \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) October 27, 2019\n\nPelosi, in a statement Sunday, confirmed \u201ctop Congressional leadership\u201d was not notified in advance and demanded the House be briefed on the raid.\n\nWallace told Pence, during an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d that Trump\u2019s decision not to notify the Democratic leader implied that the president was \u201cworried that Pelosi or members of Congress would leak this.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes the president not trust the speaker of the House with sensitive national security information?\u201d Wallace asked.\n\nPence denied that was Trump\u2019s \u201cimplication at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think from the time that we got actionable intelligence, the president\u2019s total focus here was on a successful mission and the safety of American troops \u2015\u201d\n\nWallace interrupted, \u201cI understand that, but why didn\u2019t he tell Nancy Pelosi?\u201d\n\nBut Pence, failing to directly answer the Fox News host\u2019s question, responded that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more proud\u201d of U.S. forces. He reiterated that no Americans were killed in the operation and that Baghdadi was dead.\n\n\u201cWe all applaud that,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cI do want to ask you, though \u2015 I mean, it\u2019s my job as a newsman, sir, respectfully \u2015 why didn\u2019t the president notify the speaker of the House?\u201d\n\nPence danced around the question again, responding that Trump had been focused on bringing Baghdadi \u201cto justice.\u201d\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), during an appearance Sunday on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week,\u201d praised Baghdadi\u2019s demise but said Trump made a \u201cmistake\u201d by not alerting him or the rest of the Gang of Eight beforehand.\n\n\u201cLook, the reason to notify the Gang of Eight is frankly more important when things go wrong,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cHad something gone wrong, had we gotten into a firefight with the Russians, it\u2019s to the administration\u2019s advantage to say we informed Congress.\u201d\n\nHe said then-President Barack Obama had notified the Gang of Eight ahead of the U.S. operation that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011.\n\nNEW: House Intel Chair Adam Schiff to @ThisWeekABC on death of ISIS leader: \"Good riddance. This was a bloodthirsty killer.\" https://t.co/GRPIcauFpK pic.twitter.com/HZV0yyA4Mu \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) October 27, 2019\n\nHuffPost reached out to the Republican members of the Gang of Eight \u2015 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina \u2015 for comment about whether they were notified of the raid on Saturday.\n\nSpokespeople for McConnell and Burr declined to comment apart from their individual statements, which did not state whether they received advance notice. The other Republicans did not immediately respond.\n\nTrump said Sunday that he spoke to Burr and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) earlier in the day about the raid. Asked during a separate press conference later in the day whether it was a mistake for Trump not to notify the Gang of Eight, Graham hesitated.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s calling family members right now. I was in town so I was right down the street,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess what I would say today is what I see happening in Syria makes sense to me.\u201d\n\nAnother reporter pressed Graham about the Gang of Eight minutes later, but the senator shrugged it off.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not my concern today. My concern today is that we did a good thing.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: Due to an editorial error, a previous version of this article referred to the Fox News host as Mike Wallace instead of Chris Wallace.", "description": "President Trump said he didn't alert \"some\" congressional leaders ahead of the U.S. operation that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db5d10e210000872ead4063.png?cache=eaj8wsbuiu&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
