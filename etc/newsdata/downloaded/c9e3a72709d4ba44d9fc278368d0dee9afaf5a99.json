MPs voted 328 to 301 to take control of the parliamentary agenda, meaning they can bring forward a bill seeking to delay the UK's exit date.\n\nImage caption The i's front page headline also takes a view on who now has control in Parliament - claiming Mr Johnson has lost it.\n\n'Boris loses control' and points the finger\n\nImage caption The Daily Mirror has the same idea as the i, opting for the headline: \"Boris loses control\". A picture of the prime minister clutching his head fills its front page and is captioned \"Political headache\".\n\nImage caption The Guardian describes the result of the Commons vote as a \"humiliating defeat\" for the prime minister. It reports: \"Several MPs appear to have been emboldened, rather than deterred, by the threat of losing the party whip - and by Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament\".\n\nImage caption The Financial Times says the 21 Tory MPs who defied the government have \"in effect sacrificed their political careers\" by trying to block a no-deal exit from the EU. Now, Mr Johnson's Brexit policy is \"facing ruin\", it reports.\n\nImage caption A different view of the night's events is offered on the front page of the Brexit-supporting Daily Express. \"Parliament surrenders to the EU\" is its main headline and an accompanying headline lambasts \"another shameful day in our so-called democracy\" and calls the Commons poll a \"vote to betray Brexit\".\n\nImage caption The Daily Telegraph focuses its front page on Mr Johnson being \"forced\" into seeking a snap general election. It describes Tuesday as a \"day of extraordinary bloodletting\" after the government said the whip would be withdrawn from the Tories who rebelled against the government.\n\nImage caption \"Now you decide, Britain\" is the headline on the front of the Daily Mail, below a photo of Mr Johnson pointing towards the camera. The UK is \"hurtling towards a general election\", the paper reports.\n\nImage caption A similar theme is followed by the Sun, with the headline \"Over to you, Britain\", again with Boris Johnson's pointed finger. Its story focuses on the prime minister's pledge to call for a general election if MPs vote in favour of no-deal legislation on Wednesday. \"Livid Boris Johnson demanded the British people decide Brexit's fate,\" the tabloid reports.\n\nImage caption But the Times reports the prime minister may face opposition to his call for a general election. Nick Brown, Labour's chief whip, has said his party would not \"fall into an elephant trap\" of agreeing to a snap poll if it could make crashing out of the EU without a deal more likely.\n\nImage caption The Daily Star leads with a story about a row between former England strikers Alan Shearer and Michael Owen. They have \"given each other a kicking\" in a Twitter row over Owen's new book, the tabloid reports. As the row is largely about the time they both spent at Newcastle United, the headline \"Wor!\" is wordplay with a localised slant.\n\nA picture of the prime minister - tousling his hair with an anguished expression - fills the front of the Daily Mirror, along with the headline \"Boris Loses Control\".\n\nThe tabloid says Mr Johnson's Brexit plans \"blew up in his face\" as rebel Conservatives sided with the opposition to defeat the government in Tuesday's Commons vote - marking the end of the \"shortest Downing Street honeymoon ever\".\n\nThe Guardian calls the vote a \"humiliation\" for Mr Johnson - suggesting several Tories were emboldened, rather than deterred, by the threat of having the whip removed.\n\nJohn Crace writes: \"Much more of this and letters will be piling up in the 1922 Committee demanding the return of Theresa May\".\n\nFor the i newspaper, the result of the vote was \"another chaotic instalment in the march towards Brexit\" - leaving the UK \"more starved of certainty than it has ever been\".\n\nThe Daily Express is appalled by the rebellion, accusing the former chancellor, Philip Hammond, and other senior Tories of surrendering to the EU.\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\n\"They've turned their back on the historic referendum result and should bear the shame of what they have done for the rest of their lives,\" it argues in its editorial.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph acknowledges that many readers will find their purge from the parliamentary Tory party \"unpalatable\" - but believes Downing Street had no choice.\n\n\"With an election around the corner, Number 10 doesn't want to run the risk of winning a majority that includes enough Remainers to make it no majority at all,\" it says.\n\nThe Financial Times says last night's events have left the Conservatives in a \"state of disintegration\", with \"poison coursing through the bloodstream\" of the party.\n\nAway from Brexit, several papers - including the Daily Mail - report on a major study linking diet drinks with an increased risk of dying early.\n\nThe research, which looked at more than 450,000 people across Europe, found that death rates from any cause were 26% higher among people who consumed two or more diet drinks a day, compared with those who had less than one a month.\n\nThe reasons are unclear, but previous studies have suggested that artificial sweeteners can trigger glucose intolerance and higher insulin levels in the blood.\n\nThe Times has the story of a lawyer who won the jackpot on the German version of \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\" - after spending 16 years re-enacting the television quiz in his basement.\n\nJan Stroh built a replica of the set and studied nearly 35-thousand past questions to prepare for his appearance on the programme, applying dozens of times before he was finally selected to take part.\n\nHe plans to use some of his winnings to renovate his mock-up studio - and has treated himself to a tailored suit.", "description": "Wednesday's newspapers respond to Boris Johnson losing his first Commons vote as prime minister.", "authors": ["Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1162/production/_108605440_metro2.jpg"}
