But though the canon has perpetually erased the contribution of women and their work has been systematically discredited, devalued and derided, their light has doggedly broken through the cracks.\n\nThe second Tuesday of every October marks Ada Lovelace Day, a day founded in 2009 by technologist Suw Charman-Anderson, to celebrate the achievements of women in Stem careers (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), and was created in memory of one in particular: Ada Lovelace, the first computer programmer.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Just last week, a leading scientist presented a talk claiming that \u201cphysics was invented and built by men\u201d. He obviously chose to ignore contributions from Marie Curie, Lise Meitner and Chien-Shiung Wu.\n\nLovelace\u2019s social standing and liberal parents enabled her to be educated in subjects usually reserved for men of her era. They enabled her to achieve things most women could not. She used her privilege to contribute work that was so ahead of its time, it took another hundred years to be fully understood. That\u2019s quite something. For these reasons, she was a clear inclusion for this book about #RenegadeWomen.\n\nAada Lovelace (10 December 1815 \u2013 27 November 1852, UK) Mathematician and computer scientist\n\nAlthough never fully recognised during her lifetime, Ada Lovelace\u2019s work prefigured modern computing and earned her the nickname the \u201cenchantress of numbers\u201d.\n\nDaughter of romantic poet Lord Byron, Lovelace was tutored in mathematics and science \u2013 subjects often forbidden for girls at the time \u2013 at the insistence of her mother. At seventeen, she met the mathematician Charles Babbage, inventor of the mechanical calculator, who was to become her mentor.\n\nLovelace was soon commissioned to translate a French article about Babbage\u2019s latest machine. While doing so, she went one step further, supplying her own commentary on it. She theorised that Babbage\u2019s machine had the potential to translate music, pictures and text into digital form. Her notes were respected and published in 1843, but the theory within was so revolutionary that it took over a century for it to be recognised as the first computer algorithm and Lovelace as the first computer programmer.\n\nLovelace died, aged 36, in 1852 and has since received a multitude of posthumous accolades. In 1980, the US Department of Defence named a computer language after her, and Ada Lovelace Day is celebrated every October in recognition of her groundbreaking contribution to computer technology.\n\nExtracted from \u2018She: A Celebration of 100 Renegade Women\u2019 by Harriet Hall, published by Headline Home is out now, \u00a312.99.
