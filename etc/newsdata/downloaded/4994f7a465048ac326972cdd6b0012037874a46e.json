Perhaps Canadians are temperamentally less inclined to shout \u201cBravissimo!\u201d for operatic celebrations of psychosis. More likely, they chose to restore some balance by recognizing an accomplished movie with a tour-de-force leading performance, but also one that\u2019s monotonous, unpleasant, and morally blech. Its director, Todd Phillips, playfully referred to it as \u201cbonkers\u201d in his Toronto introduction, but he\u2019s giving himself too much credit. The thinking behind the film is very conventional. As Hannah Arendt saw banality in the supposed evil of the Nazi Adolf Eichmann, I see in Joker an attempt to elevate nerdy revenge to the plane of myth. That\u2019s scary on a lot of different levels.\n\nAlthough this is an \u201corigin\u201d story, Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Arthur Fleck is a volatile party clown well before he adopts that fabled moniker. But there\u2019s a key difference: He\u2019s a victim, more sinned against than sinning. Oh, what a litany of injuries: In the first scene, a group of teens steal the sign he carries for a Going Out of Business sale and bash it over his head when he gives chase, after which \u2014 insult to injury \u2014 his boss accuses him of stealing the sign and deducts the cost from Arthur\u2019s wages. A colleague gives him a gun and then \u2014 when the weapon clatters to the floor during a party for sick kids \u2014 denies it. An attractive single mother (Zazie Beetz) in his rundown apartment building can barely keep from grimacing in the face of his greasy leering. Social services are being cut to put money in the pockets of Gotham City\u2019s wealthy \u2014 among them Thomas Wayne, soon-to-be-murdered father of Bruce, who\u2019ll go bats \u2014 which means Arthur no longer has easy access to his meds, which means he could provoke still more scummy thugs with his Tourette\u2019s-like tendency to break into laughter in moments of stress. Sure enough, he\u2019s attacked on the subway, this time by drunken yuppies who happen to work for Wayne. A popular talk show host, Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro), cruelly ridicules his attempt to be a stand-up comic at an open-mic event. Add to this an overbearing, sickly mother (Frances Conroy) and a history of childhood abuse \u2014 is it any wonder the outcast/victim sees only two possibilities: suicide or assuming the guise of a supervillain? You have to admire Arthur for his self-actualization. It sure beats impotence \u2014 or nonexistence, which is the ultimate impotence.\n\nWe want Joker. We need Joker, if only to end the slow, masochistic trajectory. Kill someone, anyone! Rescue our eyes from those underlit interiors with their pools of red and green and yellow light \u2014 harlequin colors with a brackish tinge \u2014 and rusted-out, graffiti-ridden \u201970s New York fire escapes and back alleys. We get the allusions \u2014 that Arthur is a melding of two Martin Scorsese protagonists, Rupert Pupkin and Travis Bickle (hence the gimmick casting of DeNiro, who doesn\u2019t seem like a natural talk show host). If Arthur could be Pupkin\u2019s sibling, he\u2019s cousin at least to Charles Bronson\u2019s urban vigilante in Death Wish. At no point are we troubled by the people he kills \u2014 they\u2019re \u201cfree-range rude\u201d in the words of Hannibal Lecter, another psycho transformed into an Existential hero after an origin story in which some mean Russians forced him to eat his little sister. Watching Arthur trudge up and down a long outdoor staircase evokes The Exorcist and its demon, Pazuzu, sometimes referred to as a clown called Captain Howdy. But here there\u2019s no exorcist in sight. We think, \u201cCome into Arthur, Captain Howdy!\u201d\n\nJoker is the ultimate Joaquin Phoenix role, which is not necessarily a compliment, though not a disparagement either. He\u2019s the best unhinged movie actor in the world. Phoenix never seems happier \u2014 or at least more at home \u2014 than when miserably lost in a character\u2019s mind, his features translating every short-circuiting synapse. There\u2019s music in his head, now flowing, now spasmodic, and when Arthur throws up his arms and twirls or does a little soft shoe, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s freeing himself from the oppression of acting sane. Take that, normalcy! When he finally makes an appearance on Franklin\u2019s talk show with his clown face and rust-colored suit, he refuses to connect with the host\u2019s rhythms, and you flash on Phoenix\u2019s nutso act with David Letterman, when he stopped the world and made it squirm. The downside to the performance is the downside to the whole movie: It\u2019s essentially repetitive. It goes nowhere you can\u2019t predict. And the other actors offer no relief. DeNiro is ill-suited to a part that calls for showbiz savvy, Beetz functions as a male projection, and Brett Cullen\u2019s Thomas Wayne would lose a charisma contest to Mike Bloomberg. Frances Conroy has a lyrical moment or two as Arthur\u2019s mom, but she\u2019s so obviously off her rocker that she functions as yet another antagonist to Arthur. The movie comes to life visually \u2014 this time imitating The French Connection \u2014 when the greasepainted Arthur flees detectives by losing himself on a subway packed with protesters dressed as clowns, but I began to dread the inevitable outcome: that Arthur will be recognized as a Clown God in the circus of horror we call urban life.\n\nJoker has been called an anthem for incels, which isn\u2019t wrong. I agree with Time\u2019s Stephanie Zacharek that\u2019s it\u2019s less an exploration of a modern pathology than a symptom of it. The movie brings to mind Stephen Metcalfe\u2019s incisive 2012 essay in Slate, after a disturbed man opened fire in a theater showing The Dark Knight Rises. Metcalfe didn\u2019t blame the movie, exactly, but he did trace a connection between civil massacres and portraits of supervillains. The young men who committed these acts believed \u201cthey had been grossly undervalued by the world \u2014 so much so, their lives had become one long psychic injury.\u201d In response, they cultivated a \u201ccharismatic malevolence\u201d and put modern technology to \u201ccreatively annihilative\u201d uses. They aggrandized themselves as Mephistophelean. Building on Arendt\u2019s work, Metcalfe said the best way to discourage incidents like the one in that theater (way more frequent since he wrote that piece) is to \u201cdivest evil of its grandiosity or mythic resonance by completely banalizing it.\u201d In other words, make them look like the loser schmucks they are.\n\nAlthough Phillips and the screenwriters sought to make Joker more realistic than its DC Comics predecessors, it exalts its protagonist and gives him the origin story of his dreams, in which killing is a just \u2014 and artful \u2014 response to a malevolently indifferent society. Arthur/Joker might be repulsive, but in a topsy-turvy universe, repulsive is attractive. I\u2019m not arguing that Joker will inspire killings (it might, but so might a lot of other things) \u2014 only that it panders to selfish, small-minded feelings of resentment and as such is profoundly boring. It\u2019s a one-joke movie.", "description": "I\u2019m not arguing that Todd Phillips\u2019s Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) will inspire killings, only that it panders to selfish, small-minded feelings of resentment.", "authors": ["David Edelstein"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/04/tiff/joker.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
