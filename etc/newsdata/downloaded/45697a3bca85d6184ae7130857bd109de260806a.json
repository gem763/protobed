It is unclear how many of those deaths were suicides.\n\nHart said the community lacks the necessary supports to deal with the grief, leading to greater risk among youth.\n\nSince becoming aware of the number of attempts, Hart said the First Nation has requested more resources from agencies including the office of Premier Dwight Ball, the RCMP and Health Canada.\n\nIn the short term, he added, it is trying to establish programming through local clinics and a youth centre.\n\n\"We are hopeful that we will be able to come together as a community during this time and help everyone who may be in trouble to get them the help and care they need,\" Hart said.\n\n\"We feel the pain that is being felt in our community and hoped to find a way forward to heal together.\"\n\nThe chief spoke publicly last year about his own family's experience with suicide, telling CBC News at the time he noticed risk factors among others in Sheshatshiu\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, especially children returning from care outside the community.\n\nWhere to get help:\n\nCanada Suicide Prevention Service: 1-833-456-4566 (phone) | 45645 (text) | crisisservicescanada.ca (chat)\n\nIn Quebec (French): Association qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de pr\u00e9vention du suicide: 1-866-APPELLE (1-866-277-3553)\n\nKids Help Phone: 1-800-668-6868 (phone), Live Chat counselling at www.kidshelpphone.ca\n\nCanadian Association for Suicide Prevention: Find a 24-hour crisis centre", "description": "A First Nations community in Newfoundland and Labrador declared a crisis on Tuesday after seeing 10 suicide attempts in a matter of days.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5285518.1568657168!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/eugene-hart.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
