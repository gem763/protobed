In police HQ bathroom still gotta get that birthday selfie'\n\nMLB wasted no time sending letters to the two women, telling them they have been banned\n\nIt's not clear if Cole was bothered by two models exposing themselves in his field of vision.\n\nHe did not seem to notice them in the moment, and since Zimmerman called time before he could throw the pitch, it's impossible to say if Cole was distracted.\n\nZimmerman ultimately drew a walk on six pitches.\n\nFollowing the game, MLB sent a letter to the brazen pair on Monday morning saying they had violated the fan code of conduct with the stunt and had been banned.\n\nThey shared the letter on Twitter from David L. Thomas, the MLB's Vice President of Security and Ballpark Operations, which read: 'During the game, you violated the fan code of conduct by exposing yourself during the 7th inning, in order to promote a business.\n\nNationals Park isn't the only Washington-area tourist attract frequented by Julia Rose\n\n'You are hereby banned from all Major League Baseball stadiums and facilities, indefinitely.'\n\nKayla Lauren, who attended the game with the models, shared on her Instagram story: 'Just got kicked out of the World Series. In police HQ bathroom still gotta get that birthday selfie.'\n\nSummer went on to explain on Twitter that she does not regret flashing the cameras because she was promoting Shagmag, which she says donates proceeds to breast cancer charities.\n\n'To clarify, yes we knew we would get banned, yes the [banishment] letters are real, and yes, I would do it again lol,' she wrote on Twitter. 'More importantly, subscribe to @SHAGMAG_ because the proceeds go directly to women with breast cancer to pay for their medical bills.'\n\nIn response to one skeptical Twitter follower, Summer explained: 'Our proceeds from @SHAGMAG_ will be going to women with breast cancer and paying off their medical bills. Meeting with them in person and doing whatever we can to help with the platform we have.'\n\nJulia Rose is the founder of online magazine Shagmag, while Summer is a brand executive.\n\nThey are known for posting a slew of topless photos to their platform.\n\nCole and the Astros did not seem to be distracted by the duo's antics, as they went on to win the game 7-1.\n\nThey lead the series 3-2, and are just one game away from winning their second World Series in three years.\n\nShagmag is a digital magazine that primarily features pictures of Rose and her model friends.\n\n'What is SHAGMAG?' reads a description of the magazine on its website.
