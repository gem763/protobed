By contrast, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who is her closest ideological ally in the crowded Democratic presidential field, has made the policy a central theme of his campaign.\n\nBarkan, a 35-year-old attorney living with ALS who now speaks with the help of a computer that reads his eye movements, specifically asked Warren why she supports a single-payer system that gets rid of private health insurance to attain universal coverage, rather than other policies aimed at achieving the same goal.\n\n\u201cI think of this as about our values. Health care is a basic human right,\u201d Warren replied. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is make sure everyone is covered at the lowest possible cost. And that\u2019s Medicare for All.\u201d\n\nWarren went on to reiterate an argument she has made when pressed on the matter in two Democratic debates \u2015 that for-profit health insurance companies whose business depends on charging as much as possible, and paying out as little as they can, are inherently inhumane.\n\nWatch Ady Barkan\u2019s interview with Sen. Elizabeth Warren:\n\nBut beyond affirming her support for Medicare for All, Warren addressed criticism from left-wing activists who question her commitment to the policy. Although Warren co-sponsored Sanders\u2019 single-payer bill beginning in 2017, she has not made it a major theme on the campaign trail, or produced her own Medicare for All plan with a white paper like she has published on everything from student debt to criminal justice.\n\nBarkan asked whether her apparent trepidation about single-payer health care\u2019s most controversial provision \u2015 the elimination of private coverage for any procedure covered by the government \u2015 reflected her affinity for regulation by market forces over \u201cdramatically expand[ing] the size of the public sector.\u201d (Warren has distinguished herself from Sanders, a self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d in part by touting her belief in markets and her identity as a \u201ccapitalist.\u201d)\n\n\u201cNo, I think it was more ... focused on transition than on endpoint,\u201d Warren responded. \u201cBut there are areas where markets just don\u2019t work and a big part of health care is one of those. So the idea that we could get a couple of regulations in place and it will sort itself out is just not true with health care.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI get financial decisions over whether you\u2019re going to be able to get a new car or what it looks like, but not financial decisions at the heart of basic health care. Medicare for All is about a relationship that all of us have to each other.\u201d\n\nGretchen Ertl / Reuters Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has endured some criticism from progressive activists skeptical of her commitment to Medicare for All.\n\nWarren has worked with Barkan since he helped launch a movement to make the Federal Reserve more accountable to ordinary workers and communities of color. In the video, she insisted that he call her \u201cElizabeth,\u201d rather than senator.\n\nWarren invoked Barkan\u2019s predicament during her discussion of Medicare for All in the second Democratic presidential debate on July 30. She noted that though Barkan has excellent private insurance, he and his wife Rachael spend $9,000 a month out of their own pocket for services not covered by their insurance. (Barkan even had to fight his insurer to get it to pay for a breathing assistance machine.)\n\nThe video with Warren is part of a series of interviews about health care with Democratic presidential candidates that Barkan is conducting in conjunction with NowThis News and Crooked Media. Barkan, an ardent proponent of single-payer health care, earlier released footage of his conversations with Sens. Sanders, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and technology entrepreneur Andrew Yang are all in the process of scheduling interviews with Barkan. Former Vice President Joe Biden has not yet responded to an invitation to sit down with Barkan.\n\nBarkan, an innovative organizer at the liberal Center for Popular Democracy, was diagnosed in 2016 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) \u2015 or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease \u2015 a terminal illness with no known cure that slowly paralyzes its victims. He has devoted the remaining years of his life to fighting for social and economic justice with a particular focus on health care.\n\nToward the end of 2017, Barkan threw himself into protests against the Republican tax cuts on the grounds that they would jeopardize key social programs. His tactic of earnestly confronting GOP senators about how their priorities would directly affect him and people with from similar maladies made him an especially effective spokesman for the movement against President Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies. He returned to Congress in April to testify before the House Rules Committee as it held the first-ever congressional hearings on Medicare for All.\n\nIn addition to his political duties, Barkan is savoring the remaining days with his wife Rachael and their toddler son Carl. He and Rachael, who is visibly pregnant in the video with Warren, are expecting a daughter.\n\nBarkan is releasing a book on Tuesday that chronicles his journey, \u201cEyes to the Wind: A Memoir of Love and Death, Hope and Resistance.\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat and friend of Barkan\u2019s, wrote the foreword.", "description": "\u201cMedicare for All is about a relationship that all of us have to each other,\u201d Warren told Ady Barkan.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d77395b240000d32677c938.jpeg?cache=2wn1wi5yp6&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
