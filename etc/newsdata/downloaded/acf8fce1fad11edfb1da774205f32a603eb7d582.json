I get why people are upset & I don't think it was @dev_101's time to go.\n\n\"But sending vile abusive tweets & death threats to @ShirleyBallas is totally out of order. Imagine if it was a member of your family on the receiving end.\"\n\nDianne replied: \"Guys this is terrible you can not be bullying like this.\n\n\"'It\u2019s awful and really upsets me to hear this. It's simply not ok and should never happen!\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nEarlier in the week, Shirley appeared on Loose Women where she claimed Strictly viewers were to blame for not saving Dev and Dianne.\n\nShirley said: \"People have got to get out there and vote. We do our job. As you can see there were many people saved with lot lower scores.\n\n\"It's just so important. I respect everybody at home who\u2019s been watching fifteen series. Everyone has a favourite. We do our job to the best we can.\n\n\"We have to do it right there in that split second on the one minute 20 seconds. We have to make a decision.\n\n\"The three judges were unanimous. It wasn\u2019t down to me. It was unanimous and I agreed.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
