We live high carbon lives and the industries that we are part of have huge carbon footprints.\"\n\n\"Like you \u2014 and everyone else \u2014 we are stuck in this fossil-fuel economy and without systemic change, our lifestyles will keep on causing climate and ecological harm.\"\n\nIt went on to say that articles labelling them \"climate hypocrites\" would \"not silence us\", and encouraged more people to join the movement.\n\nIn a separate note, actor Steve Coogan said he believed Extinction Rebellion \"should be applauded for putting [climate] at the top of the agenda where it belongs.\"\n\nHe added: \"I stand in full support of these brave, determined activists who are making a statement on behalf of us all.\"\n\nMeanwhile, actor Jamie Winstone said: \"I will continue to change my life for the greater good for the planet.\n\n\"I will continue to push for climate justice\u2026we all need to change the way we live our lives for a healthier living planet and stop living in denial that climate crisis isn\u2019t real.\n\n\"It\u2019s happening. We all need to make changes if we want to survive and our children to thrive.\u201d\n\nLondon ban\n\nThe letter was released after the UK's Metropolitan Police earlier this week banned Extinction Rebellion from protesting in London as part of their Autumn Uprising.\n\nIn a statement, the Met said a total of 1,642 arrests had been made in connection with the protests, which have, at times, brought parts of the UK capital to a standstill.\n\nBut Extinction Rebellion has said it will defy the ban, even if it means further arrests and prosecutions are made.\n\nIt said on Tuesday: \"The climate and ecological emergency isn't going away and we remain resolute in facing it.\n\n\"We urge the government and the authorities to join us in doing the same. We cannot do it alone. This is bigger than all of us.\"", "description": "A hundred high-profile people have signed a letter admitting that they are \"hypocrites\" for joining the Extinction Rebellion movement, but continue to lead high-carbon lifestyles.", "authors": ["Rachael Kennedy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/76/06/1000x563_cmsv2_6ad0cc02-5236-5229-a4e6-4c4aff19ed63-4237606.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
