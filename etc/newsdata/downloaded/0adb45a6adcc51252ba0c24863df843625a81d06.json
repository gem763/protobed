New Zealand's head coach Steve Hansen looks on. REUTERS/Annegret Hilse\n\nJapan caused an upset of the same proportion as their win over the Springboks four years ago when they defeated Ireland 19-12 in Shizuoka on Saturday.\n\nThe match could have repercussions for the All Blacks, who could potentially face the hosts in the quarter-finals and while Hansen said he was only focussing on their Pool B game against Canada on Wednesday, he was still impressed by Japan\u2019s win.\n\n\u201cThey did give us plenty to think about,\u201d Hansen told reporters at the team hotel in Beppu. \u201cTheir speed of ball was great, their line speed was awesome, they just kept coming, time after time after time.\n\n\u201cWe like to play fast, I don\u2019t know if we want to play that fast or if we can play that fast in the humidity we\u2019re playing in.\n\n\u201cIt certainly affected the Irish, that speed of the game.\u201d\n\nHansen added the hosts\u2019 win was good for the tournament and while they could still win Pool A and avoid the All Blacks in the knockout phase there was also a chance they could finish runners-up and meet his side in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important at the Rugby World Cup that you don\u2019t think too far ahead as plans change all the time,\u201d Hansen said.\n\n\u201cIf we have to play Japan then we will prepare accordingly and we\u2019ll expect what we saw the other day, them coming at us 100 miles an hour and wanting to turn opportunities into fast ball.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have make plans to make sure they can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nHansen, who is stepping down after the tournament after 16 years with the team as an assistant and head coach, added that Japan coach Jamie Joseph could potentially take control of the All Blacks one day.\n\n\u201cJamie Joseph\u2019s a very good coach, but he didn\u2019t become one overnight just because he coached Japan to beat Ireland,\u201d Hansen said of his fellow New Zealander.\n\n\u201cI always find it amusing, you beat someone and all of a sudden you\u2019re a super coach. I hold the world record for the most losses in a row and the world record for the most wins in a row, so what sort of coach am I?\n\n\u201cCoaching\u2019s a lot more than just the results. Is he good enough to be an All Black coach? I think he is one day.\n\n\u201cAm I picking the next coach? No. So there\u2019s not much point even asking what my opinion is because those people who are appointing him won\u2019t take any notice of it anyway.\u201d", "description": "The speed at which Japan attacked Ireland would be hard to live with for any team and the All Blacks will need to learn how to combat their style of play if they meet in the quarter-finals, New Zealand coach Steve Hansen said on Monday.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435471734&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T0I5", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
