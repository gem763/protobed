They're very technically brilliant,' Trump said in reference to those working for the so-called Islamic caliphate.\n\n'You know, they use the internet better than almost anybody in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump,' he continued. 'But they use the internet incredibly well and what they've done with the internet through recruiting and everything.'\n\nDonald Trump said ISIS uses the Internet 'better than almost anyone in the world, perhaps other than' himself. He is often referred to as the tweeter-in-chief\n\nISIS often uses social media and the Internet to recruit people and would post violent videos of them beheading or torturing U.S. citizens\n\nTrump made the remarks while talking about the U.S. Special Operations take down of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi overnight. He detonated his suicide vest killing himself and three of his children when he was cornered by U.S. forces in his northwest Syrian lair\n\nTrump said he wanted to make sure that ISIS militants and followers of al-Baghdadi are aware that he 'died like a dog' and 'coward,' who was 'whimpering, screaming and crying.'\n\n'Frankly, I think it's something that should be brought out so that his followers and all of these young kids that want to leave various countries \u2013 including the United States \u2013 they should see how he died,' Trump said. 'He didn't die a hero, he died a coward \u2013 crying, whimpering, and screaming and bringing three kids with him to die. Certain death.'\n\nThe president monitored the operation and al-Baghdadi's death from the Situation Room with Vice President Mike Pence, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley and Brig. General Marcus Evans.\n\nPence confirmed they had 'eyes on' the situation the whole time, as well as were updated in real time of the developments.\n\nIt isn't clear in Trump's remarks Sunday morning if there was actual video footage of the raid and if the president was alluding to wanting to somehow make that public or available to view.\n\nTrump, dubbed by some critics as the tweeter-in-chief, is very active on social media and often communicates official presidential matters directly to the world through tweets, a very untraditional way to portray such important topics.", "description": "Donald Trump suggested that he is the most tech savvy person ever, second only to ISIS.
