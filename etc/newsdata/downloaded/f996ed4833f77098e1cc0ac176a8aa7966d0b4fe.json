It\u2019s a pretty horrible place, yet us hookers and props live for it.\n\nIt\u2019s a huge physical battle, but it\u2019s also psychological warfare.\n\nScrums are a huge psychological battle of wits as well as physically demanding\n\nToday\u2019s Test against Argentina will be no exception. Scrums are one of the old bastions of our sport and something we need to appreciate.\n\nWhen the two packs set up for the first scrum, there is always a very calm moment before the hit when you go through the processes that you\u2019ve spent hours perfecting. You want to show the referee that you\u2019re technically very good \u2014 not over-leaning, controlling your weight with good body positions.\n\nYou want to paint a picture so the referee says: \u2018All right, these guys mean business.\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s sometimes a bit of bickering, asking the referee to look at an angle or foot position \u2014 or calling out someone about their weight. It\u2019s not quite wicket-keeper standard and you can\u2019t say too much with ref links and TV microphones, but that doesn\u2019t always stop Joe Marler!\n\nScrums are one of the old bastions of our sport and something we need to appreciate\n\nAs a hooker, you have to deliver a lot of key messages. Once you set and engage, then \u2018bang\u2019, all of your practice comes to the fore.\n\nMost teams have a collective call \u2014 \u2018Hit, two, three\u2019 or something similar \u2014 to make sure your timing is right and all 16 feet are pushing into the ground at the same time. So many parts of rugby are individual \u2014 carrying, tackling, breakdown \u2014 but the scrum is a collective effort. If one man doesn\u2019t turn up, the other seven are vulnerable.\n\nThe front-row has to carry the weight of their team-mates through their lower back, spine and neck. You hold your breath to expand your chest to stay rigid and strong. You\u2019re hit by a smell of Deep Heat, grass, dribble and sweat. At hooker, the arteries in your neck can be pinned and that cuts off the oxygen to your head.\n\nI\u2019ve fainted twice in this situation. You can burst blood vessels in your face from holding your breath and pushing too hard \u2014 that\u2019s why you see guys with blotchy faces after the game. You have to get the balance right. If the scrum goes down, your face is in the dirt, tasting grass.\n\nWhen two packs set up for the first scrum, there is always a very calm moment before the hit\n\nThere used to be the so-called dark arts of the scrum. My first taste of this was in my second Premiership game, when Danny Grewcock slipped his bind and punched me in the face three times. You would go over the top of another scrum and look for someone\u2019s hand to stand on.\n\nYou can\u2019t do that now. There are cameras everywhere and it\u2019s picked up. Dark arts have shifted to being technically sound.\n\nUltimately you want to provide a strong platform to deliver the ball to Billy Vunipola\u2019s feet.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve achieved that, you can go for the double-shove penalty advantage if you\u2019re in the ascendency. There\u2019s no better ball for George Ford and Owen Farrell than free-ball, penalty advantage, if they want to speculate and try out something in attack.\n\nWhat you don\u2019t want is for the ball to be stuck at the lock\u2019s feet.\n\nAs a hooker, you have to deliver a lot of key messages - all of your practice comes to the fore\n\nIf that happens, the No 8 has to dig it out, so you lose one man\u2019s footing. When one foot is off of the ground it\u2019s 15 feet against 16 feet!\n\nYou can have all the technique and all the processes in the world but sometimes it comes down to sheer bloody-mindedness.\n\nArgentina are an emotional pack with plenty of kilos so that makes them a challenge for anyone. For me, however, England and South Africa have the best scrums in the world. The scrum is part of England\u2019s DNA. They do not fear anyone. They will be looking to assert their dominance, physically and psychologically, and keep Argentina guessing \u2014 when are they going to scrum and when are they going to play away?\n\nNo better ball for George Ford and Owen Farrell (above) than free-ball, penalty advantage\n\nThey\u2019ll put the squeeze on sometimes and they\u2019ll launch Billy off the back other times.\n\nWhat makes England\u2019s pack even more impressive is their collective ability around the park.\n\nGuys like Luke Cowan-Dickie, Jamie George, Mako Vunipola and Marler have deft handling skills, strong carrying, massive defence and breakdown presence.\n\nRewind 10 years and that stuff was a bonus \u2014 now it\u2019s the norm.\n\nBut all those guys love nothing more than a scrum and they\u2019ll be licking their lips at the prospect of facing the Pumas today.\n\nWe won with a school team last time!\n\nThe last time I played Argentina was on the summer tour of 2017, when a lot of our guys were away in New Zealand with the Lions. We had so many young guys that it felt like a school trip at times. I was rooming with Tom Curry, 18 years old, still in his pyjamas. We went out there and beat a team that had been together all year. That was the emergence of guys like Curry, Joe Cokanasiga, Piers Francis and Jack Singleton. It was a really good tour to launch some big careers.\n\nI said to the team: 'The next time we play these guys will be at the World Cup.' Going into Saturday's game knowing they have won five times on the bounce means there will be no fear.\n\nEngland's clash against Argentina back in 2017 featured young guns like Joe Cokanasiga\n\nI'm looking forward to...\n\nJapan v Samoa\n\nI could predict the result of most games this weekend, but Samoa are due a performance. I've really enjoyed the Japan story so far. Everyone wants to see them do well. They are earning more and more respect as their rugby story goes on, but Samoa will be out to spoil the party.\n\nKick-off: 11.30am, LIVE on ITV", "description": "DYLAN HARTLEY: When the two packs set up for the first scrum, there is always a very calm moment before the hit when you go through the processes that you've spent hours perfecting.", "authors": ["Dylan Hartley For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/20/19310616-0-image-a-27_1570217809189.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
