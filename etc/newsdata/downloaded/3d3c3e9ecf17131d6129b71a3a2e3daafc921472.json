Chants of \u201cSiu-lun! Siu-lun! Siu-lun!\u201d grew louder as the swimmer sped closer to the finish line.\n\nWhen Frank took his last stroke and placed his hands on the touch pad, shouts filled Kowloon Park Swimming Pool. The 15-year-old had set a new record in the Boys\u2019 Grade B 50 metre Butterfly event at the annual Interschool Swimming Competition on October 18, pushing it from 25.85 seconds to 25.45 seconds.\n\nIt was a jaw-dropping performance, made more incredible by the fact that Frank isn\u2019t even usually a butterfly swimmer. No one was expecting a backstroke swimmer to perform so well in another style.\n\nHong Kong teen swimmer Natalie Kan has the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in her sights\n\nEven then, Frank, who has previously won two Interschool backstroke events, had a few more tricks up his sleeve; he went on to smash the 100 metre Freestyle record twice \u2013 first during the heats, and then again in the October 25 finals.\n\nSpeaking to Young Post at the competition, the Ying Wa College student said that skipping the backstroke events in favour of other races was an attempt to step out of his comfort zone, as well as a strategic move to boost his school\u2019s ranking.\n\n\u201cI entered the butterfly and freestyle events this year because I wanted to try something new,\u201d said Frank. \u201cIt was also a tactic to help my school, because we don\u2019t have enough swimmers to win medals in those events.\u201d\n\nAt the age of 15, Frank is considered one of the pillars of Ying Wa College's swimming team.

He admitted it was \u201cquite impossible\u201d for his school to push the indomitable Diocesan Boys\u2019 School from the top spot.\n\nBut in the eyes of Ying Wa\u2019s student body, Frank, who has been dubbed the new \u201cking of backstroke\u201d by local media, is the star they\u2019ve been waiting for to lead the school to success. It isn\u2019t a role he is entirely comfortable with.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think people should call me that,\u201d he said, referring to the media\u2019s nickname. \u201cIt puts me under a lot of pressure, because I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t live up to people\u2019s high expectations.\u201d\n\nHong Kong Inter-School Swimming Competition 2019: all the final results after an action-packed day\n\nBefore racing, Frank does his best to push these worries out of his mind. He has a specific pre-race ritual, which involves patting his chest (hence the patches of red on his skin), splashing water on his face, letting out a good shout, and giving himself a pep talk.\n\n\u201cI tell myself that I can do it. And if I don\u2019t perform well, I just tell myself to come back stronger next time.\u201d\n\nFrank\u2019s remarkable performance this month is in part thanks to the professional training he has been receiving at the Hong Kong Sports Institute.\n\nFrank set two new records at this year's Interschool Swimming Competition. Photo: Kelly Ho/SCMP\n\nThe teen officially joined the Hong Kong team this June, and now trains for at least 20 hours a week. It\u2019s an exhausting regimen, but more than 10 years of swimming experience has taught Frank that diligence and persistence are key to finding success in the sport.\n\n\u201cSwimming is all about perseverance. If you can\u2019t push through the tough times, you\u2019re not suitable for the sport,\u201d he said.\n\nFrank is set to compete to in another local competition this weekend, performing his trifecta \u2013 backstroke, freestyle and butterfly \u2013 at the Hong Kong Age Group Long Course Swimming Championships. His goal is to achieve a new personal best time in all three events, which will help him secure a spot on the representative team for Asian and international tournaments next year.\n\nThe rising star\u2019s advice to others in his sport is heart-warming: just keep swimming.\n\n\u201cYou may think you\u2019ll never swim well \u2013 I have been there, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re willing to persist, nothing is impossible. So don\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nEdited by Charlotte Ames-Ettridge", "description": "An official member of the Hong Kong team, his advice to others after breaking interschool records is to \"just keep swimming\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/26631db0-f919-11e9-acf9-cafedce87d15imagehires130213.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
