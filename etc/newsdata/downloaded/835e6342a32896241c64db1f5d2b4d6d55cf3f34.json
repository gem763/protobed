(Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nReporter\n\nWall Street moguls and the giant corporations that have profited during the decade-long bull market have been getting much of our attention the past few years.\n\nBut what about Main Street and the many independent, family-run businesses that provide a sense of community, instill self-esteem in their entrepreneurs and create jobs for people who channel Norman Rockwell over big-city life?\n\nThe Wine Attic, a cozy, second-floor boutique in a leafy corner of Fairfax County, Va., is all about Main Street.\n\nJuan and Ren\u00e9e Navarro run the sole proprietorship in the town of Clifton, a quaint spot known as the hideaway where first lady Nancy Reagan lunched with journalist George Will back in the 1980s. Fellow restaurant guests serenaded the pair \u2014 along with Reagan\u2019s Secret Service contingent \u2014 with a chorus of \u201cWe Wish You a Merry Christmas\u201d during one holiday season visit in 1988.\n\nIn an era of big-box competitors like Total Wine, Costco and Walmart, the Wine Attic provides a window into how a little company can stay alive paying super-close attention to the customer base.\n\n\u201cWe sell ourselves,\u201d said Juan, a 43-year-old former restaurant manager. \u201cIt\u2019s the Juan and Ren\u00e9e experience. Every second with the customer counts. Once I meet them, I know what every customer wants when they come in. You can\u2019t do that in a high-volume business.\u201d\n\n[Arthur Cashin, wise to the ways of Wall Street]\n\nThe Wine Attic doesn\u2019t make a ton. It grosses about $250,000 in revenue a year, which pays the bills and delivers modest salaries to the husband-and-wife owners. This year has been good. Revenue already hit $200,000 \u2014 and the October-through-December busy season lies ahead. Gross revenue could approach $300,000.\n\nThe Navarros live a short drive away in Centreville with their two children. They love being their own boss and enjoy a sense of accomplishment in building a (barely) profitable business while embedding themselves in the daily life of Clifton.\n\nHow embedded? They once babysat a customer\u2019s dog.\n\nThe Navarros have owned the shop since 2017 and stick close to business basics: one owner always on premises, providing personal service, knowing your customers and enough of a connection to draw customers back.\n\n\u201cI am here every single day,\u201d Juan said. \u201cFace time is the key. You have to establish trust with people, and let them know who we are and what we are all about. We build a repeat business that way.\u201d\n\n[2019 shaping up as the year of the fad IPO]\n\nClifton is a wealthy enclave in one of the wealthiest counties in the U.S. You have to believe there is ample discretionary income to support a niche business like the Navarros\u2019.\n\nThe Wine Attic is a bit top-heavy with 10 loyal customers who spend $95 per transaction, more than twice the average of $42 per customer. The Big Ten account for a significant chunk of sales.\n\n\u201cWe do probably eight to 10 times more business on a Saturday than on a Tuesday,\u201d Juan said.\n\nBut the Navarros are working toward broadening their customer base \u2014 and their income.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Wine Attic\u2019s wine club comes in.\n\nThe club\u2019s 80 members spend $55.67 per month on average, including their monthly charge for two bottles of wine selected by Juan and Ren\u00e9e. That comes to about $4,400 per month from the group.\n\nThe wine club creates the recurring revenue stream that makes income less \u201clumpy\u201d and less reliant on the whims of tourists who swamp Clifton every weekend. Members, ranging in age from 24 to 70, gather quarterly in the shop to socialize and chat about the wines they are sampling.\n\n[This water bottle knows how much you\u2019ve had to drink \u2014 and it tells your phone]\n\n\u201cThey get access to wines that they wouldn\u2019t have thought of themselves,\u201d Juan said. \u201cThey get 10 percent discounts on everything in the shop. They get special events such as meeting people in the wine industry.\u201d\n\nOctober\u2019s wine club theme is Austrian wines, and November\u2019s will be French. In March, the Navarros featured wines from India.\n\n\u201cThe wine club turns a one-visit guest into a repeat guest,\u201d Juan said. \u201cGrowing it is our priority.\u201d\n\nThe resourceful couple employ other strategies for recruiting customers. They do things like sponsoring a \u201chaunted trail\u201d and a holiday homes tour full of Christmas decorations.\n\nEvery October (next weekend, in fact) the town celebrates Clifton Day. Its streets close to traffic, and booths and vendors appear as if rising like a Virginian \u201cBrigadoon.\u201d\n\nThe Virginia Railway Express train makes a special stop in the middle of the town, with hundreds of tourists spilling out onto the streets.\n\nThe Wine Attic pitches a tent a few yards from the train platform, offering a wine tasting that helps make Clifton Day one of its most lucrative days of the year.\n\n[Corwin Heatwole believes the home team can produce a better bird]\n\n\u201cSeveral hundred people will come to the shop that day and go home with brochures, calendars and any promotional items we have,\u201d Juan said.\n\nJuan said his most popular wine sells for $12. The average price for a bottle is about $24 \u2014 \u201cour sweet spot,\u201d as he calls it.\n\nMy wife, Polly, and I visited Clifton last weekend and made the climb to the Attic\u2019s second-floor showroom.\n\nLocals and tourists were milling about, checking out the goods and sampling some Italian wines. Portraits for sale by a local artist hung on the walls. The store has a \u201ckids corner\u201d full of coloring books and story books for parents who want to check out the wine and stay a few hours.\n\nWe bought three bottles of red for a little over $100 total. We bought the store\u2019s biggest seller, a Portuguese red blend called Quinta de Cabriz D\u00e3o Colheita Seleccionada that cost $12 including tax. We also bought a cabernet sauvignon from Chile for $70, which Juan said to serve \u201cif you want to show off to your friends.\u201d Lastly, we bought another Chilean wine, a 2014 pinot noir for $38 called Calyptra Gran Reserva.\n\n[Woodworkers transform salvaged logs into high-end furniture]\n\nRen\u00e9e, 37, and Juan are both from Northern Virginia and came up through the restaurant business.\n\nJuan began as a server and later managed locations for Great American Restaurants, the holding company for local brands such as Carlyle, Best Buns Bread Company and Artie\u2019s.\n\nHis parents were self-employed interior decorators who rode the Washington market\u2019s 1980s housing boom, so the self-starter knew that being an entrepreneur was risky but would give him more control over his life.\n\nAnd \u201cI got sick of working for other people,\u201d Juan said, simply.\n\nJuan had been a patron of what was then called the Clifton Wine Shop. It had been owned by a local woman who left town, leaving the business empty and the space open.\n\nAfter town approval, a $30,000 investment and an alcohol license, \u201cwe were able to move in and open up a shop with our identity and run it our way,\u201d Juan said.\n\nLike I said, they aren\u2019t making a ton, but they turn a profit and are building something.\n\n\u201cOur plan from day one was to pay ourselves and put us in a situation where we are going to do this and support our family,\u201d said the businessman. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much it. We try to keep it as simple as possible.\u201d", "description": "Total Wine, Costco and Walmart have volume.
