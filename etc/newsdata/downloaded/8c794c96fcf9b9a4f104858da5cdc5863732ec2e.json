You can form your own view.

Here\u2019s everything you need to know.\n\nWhen will the rematch happen?\n\nIt was widely believed that the first fight would happen at some point early in 2019, likely February, but soon after facing Paul, KSI admitted that he wanted an extended break away from the ring to recover and that it would be sometime \u201cin the summer\u201d \u2013 having fought twice in 2018, it\u2019s understandable.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We're not too far off then.\n\nWhere will the rematch take place?\n\nThe fight between the two YouTube sensations will take place at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles, California. The first went down at the MEN Arena in Manchester, so this time it's on Logan's turf.\n\nHow can I get tickets?\n\nDemand for the first fight was somewhat unprecedented and sold out the Manchester Arena, so if you like the idea of being around 18,000 screaming kids for hours then you\u2019ll have to act fast. They\u2019ll be sold in the same places as the first fight, their joint website and the website of the venue it will be held at, so keep your eyes peeled.\n\nWhere will I be able to watch the fight?\n\nThe distribution for this one may not be as straightforward as the first fight and that\u2019s simply because of the demand. The two YouTube stars created a joint channel where they charged \u00a37.50 per viewer to watch, later releasing it for free and it has now been viewed in total over 20 million times \u2013 staggering numbers considering it was an amateur bout. It will almost certainly be streamed on YouTube via the same channel but with it now promoted by Eddie Hearn and Matchroom Boxing, expect it to land on DAZN in America and your screens elsewhere in the UK.\n\nWhat have they said since the first fight?\n\nKSI: \u201cLogan is saying I\u2019m trying to dodge the rematch, that I don\u2019t want to fight. I have ignored everything. November is the ideal date for both of us to train and concentrate on our careers, I want to release more music.\u201d\n\nLogan Paul: \u201cHe\u2019s not gonna make it past two rounds, absolutely gonna knock him out. If he doesn\u2019t bitch out.\u201d", "description": "KSI and Logan Paul are set to do battle again in 2019, after the pair first met in what was described as the \u201cbiggest internet event in history\u201d\u00a0last year.", "authors": ["Adam Hamdani"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/28/18/ksilogan.jpg"}
