(Kevin Terrell via AP)\n\nDemario Davis had already parlayed his violation of an NFL rule on game-day attire into a charity fundraising drive when the story took an even happier turn for the New Orleans Saints linebacker.\n\nAccording to Davis, he won an appeal of the $7,017 fine handed to him by the league \u2014 and he said that money will instead go toward the cause he has been promoting.\n\nAlong the way, Davis picked up support from a New Orleans-area Catholic school, where youngsters showed off their own versions Tuesday of the \u201cMan of God\u201d headband that garnered the NFL\u2019s scrutiny.\n\nNew Orleans students wear 'Children of God' headbands to support Demario Davis https://t.co/B7dkQTFBYM pic.twitter.com/Wk2QytROEz \u2014 wdsu (@wdsu) October 8, 2019\n\nThese little Who Dats at SLKF show their support for \u2066@Saints\u2069 linebacker Damario Davis with their \u201cChild of God\u201d headbands.

He noted that children from St. Louis King of France Catholic School, in Metairie, La., \u201ccame together today to support the movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at all these beautiful children of God!\u201d Davis added.\n\nThe eighth-year NFL player, in his second season with the Saints, went on to assert that he would be \u201ctaking every penny of that original $7,017 fine\u201d and donating it to St. Dominic Hospital in Jackson, Miss., where he grew up. According to the hospital, Davis\u2019s mother worked there while he starred in high school, before he went on to become a third-round pick by the New York Jets in 2012.\n\nSales of headbands emblazoned with \u201cMan of God\u201d and \u201cWoman of God\u201d to raise funds for St. Dominic picked up after the NFL informed Davis he would be fined for wearing one during a September game between his Saints and the Seattle Seahawks. He quickly posted an image of one of the headbands and asked his social-media followers, \u201cShould I continue to wear it, or nah?\u201d\n\nDavis decided to stop wearing the garment on game days, thus sparing himself the prospect of greater fines, but his post, which included a link to a website where the headbands were available for purchase, went viral.\n\n\u201cSo far, we\u2019ve raised over $30,000 for [the hospital] from the headbands!!\u201d Davis wrote Tuesday. \u201cThat means yall helped me turn a $7,000 negative into an almost $40,000 positive benefiting people who truly need it!!!\"\n\nLeague rules state that while players are \u201cvisible to the stadium and television audience\u201d on game days, they are \u201cprohibited from wearing, displaying, or otherwise conveying personal messages either in writing or illustration, unless such message has been approved in advance by the League office.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the NFL was not immediately available for comment on Davis\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of people were aware of the policy that was in place \u2014 I wasn\u2019t even fully aware of it,\u201d Davis told the New Orleans Times-Picayune last week. \u201cI just wanted to put it out and just kind of help fans who care about the game understand a more intricate part of the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you don\u2019t want to be fined,\u201d Davis said to the newspaper. \u201cNobody wants to lose money, but I think any time that the conversation about God is brought up, especially in these times, I think it\u2019s always a positive or silver lining. If He can get glory from it, I think He can get glory from it whether I personally wear the headband or don\u2019t wear the headband. He\u2019s always gonna be in control of the whole situation. We\u2019re still all good.\u201d\n\nNews of the fine from the NFL made ripples nationally, with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee tweeting last week, \u201cWhy so many empty seats at NFL games? Players who show disrespect for flag & Anthem are defended by NFL & get Nike contracts, but players who express their faith get fined big $$ for \u2018personal messages.\u2019\"\n\nSuggestions online that Davis was being punished by the NFL for expressing a religious viewpoint got the attention of fact-checking website Snopes.com, which clarified that the offense was related to the \u201c 'personal message\u2019 provision of the league\u2019s dress code policy.\u201d The website pointed out that the NFL has previously fined players for, among other things, wearing unauthorized items that supported causes such as breast cancer awareness, as well as for donning wrong-colored socks.\n\nAfter expressing delight over the money raised by the headband sales, Davis wrote Tuesday that his experience showed how \u201cobstacles are meant to be conquered.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m truly blessed as anybody,\u201d he added.\n\nRead more:\n\nWho will be the next Redskins\u2019 coach?
