Moyo has filed a legal action to have the board declared in contempt of court for not allowing him back at work. He also wants the board to be declared delinquent.\n\nMoholi\u2019s resignation may be interpreted as a sign of dissent within the board.\n\nMoyo and Old Mutual have filed various legal actions against each other, in a dispute about whether the CEO's services have been legally terminated. Old Mutual has fired Moyo twice in recent months.\n\n\u201cMs Moholi wished the Board all the best during this difficult time, and stated that she was honoured to have had the privilege to serve as a director of the company over the last 7 years,\u201d Old Mutual said in a statement.", "description": "In an apparent blow to chairman Trevor Manuel, Old Mutual director Nombulelo Pinky Moholi has resigned with immediate effect.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5566/b8862008caea4694a7e1ad36d18fe436.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
