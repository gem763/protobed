But plenty of adults have left behind sedentary lifestyles \u2013 you just have to find the right approach\n\nWhen Sarah Overall was a child, a PE teacher held the entire class back because Overall would not do the high jump. She was tiny \u2013 as an adult, she is under 5ft (1.5m) tall \u2013 and was scared of hurting herself on the metal bar. \u201cI was too short to get over it,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember the whole class watching.\u201d Netball was \u201cpure hell\u201d. She enjoyed hockey, which suited her body better, but she felt written off by her PE teacher. \u201cI was like: \u2018Do you not get that I actually work really hard at the things I can do?\u2019\u201d\n\nNow, years later, Overall is a personal trainer and sees the damage that bad PE lessons have had on her clients. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much everybody who comes to me,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got anybody, especially a woman, who has said: \u2018I was good at sport at school.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt is something other trainers see, too. \u201cKids at school are not like babies and toddlers who try to crawl, fail, try to crawl, fail,\u201d says Joslyn Thompson Rule, a personal trainer. \u201cThey sense embarrassment and shame, and it\u2019s easier not to try than to try but fail. Unfortunately, it becomes a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy and leads to them not being able to do it.\u201d Teenage experience, she says, \u201ccan affect your perception of your ability\u201d.\n\nThe things we are told as children and teenagers stay with us. I was not particularly sporty at school, although I clearly remember being praised by my PE teacher one day after a volleyball class. The idea that I am good at that one particular sport has, weirdly, become a small part of my identity \u2013 even though I have never played a game of volleyball since. Likewise, I hated cross-country running with a passion and, for years, told myself it wasn\u2019t for me, only to discover a love of running \u2013 especially over fields and hills \u2013 more than two decades later.\n\n\u201cKids pick up all kinds of stuff, whether or not anybody actually labels them \u2013 they make comparisons with their peers and draw conclusions,\u201d says Wendy Johnson, a professor of psychology at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing intrinsic to say these kinds of labels have to get wired into our identities, but sometimes they do \u2013 when kids are often last to be picked for teams or laughed at for being slow or clumsy. Things can happen along the way to reverse impressions like this, but for some kids, these identities can last a lifetime.\u201d\n\nAll of this is not to bash PE teachers, although many adults who still hate exercise blame the teaching methods of decades ago. There is a lot of good practice out there, says Stuart Kay, schools director of the Youth Sport Trust. Schools are under immense pressure, and PE is suffering (according to research last year by the trust, 38% of secondary schools in England have cut the time dedicated to PE for 14- to 16-year-olds since 2012).\n\nThe stereotype of the sadistic games teacher is probably largely unfair, but, says Kay, there is \u201croom for improvement in some areas\u201d. Historically, PE lessons were \u201clargely about physical ability\u201d, he argues, but for older children it is equally important for the lessons to cover social and emotional wellbeing.\n\n\u201cIf you think about some of the things that turn people off sport, they\u2019re probably the same things that turn people off competition,\u201d he says. Competition can be made more inclusive beyond physical ability. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to get rid of competition; instead, we\u2019re saying what can you do about the rules, the environment, and how are you going to decide on a winner? By reframing competition, you can make it more inclusive, and make sure that things other than sporting prowess are celebrated.\u201d\n\nThese could include allowing everyone to play, rather than only a select few making a team, or changing the scoring so it is not only about goals or runs \u2013 the outcome of a game \u2013 but also giving scores for behaviour or skill.\n\nJohnson says she always told her children: \u201cExercise is good for our bodies, and everyone can find some exercise they can enjoy; it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re particularly good at it.\u201d As an adult, you can shift your identity around whether or not you are \u201csporty\u201d by simply doing it, she says. \u201cPick up any issue of Runner\u2019s World \u2013 it\u2019s full of people who have come to running in their 40s or 50s and ended up getting into it and running marathons. I don\u2019t mean winning, but they see the benefits not just of the exercise, but joining a club, where the focus is on the community rather than being the best.\u201d\n\nLabels such as \u201csporty\u201d have particular connotations, she says, and it is not necessarily useful to think of yourself in those terms. \u201cNot just about exercise and health, but about fashion, values, lifestyles, athleticism and sexual identity. Physical exercise that boosts physical health and psychological wellbeing comes in many forms that aren\u2019t sporty \u2013 dancing is exercise, as is gardening, carpentry and housework. If the goal is physical exercise for health, one doesn\u2019t have to have a sporty identity. Think broadly about anything that involves getting yourself moving.\u201d\n\nOverall rediscovered sport after enjoying aerobics classes. Hannah Lewin, a personal trainer, says many of her clients suffer from a lack of confidence around sport and exercise, usually instilled in them as teenagers. Instead of something to be enjoyed, sport became \u201ca stressful experience. An early negative experience around being shamed, or being forced to do something you weren\u2019t naturally very good at \u2013 and then belittled for not being very good at it \u2013 is something I see every day. It really does carry through into adulthood.\u201d\n\nAdults tend to find their way to her \u2013 and exercise \u2013 once their confidence has improved. \u201cThey may have had other successes in work or relationships,\u201d says Lewin. Overall adds: \u201cYou\u2019re now doing this for yourself. You don\u2019t have the pressure of teammates, and nobody is judging you. Don\u2019t compare yourself with anybody else. Once you find the activity that is right for you, and a situation you are comfortable in, you can be surprised at what you can do.\u201d She has had clients who have gone from sedentary lifestyles to running marathons.\n\nAll the personal trainers I speak to say you should choose something you enjoy \u2013 this isn\u2019t about compulsory rounders any more. \u201cGyms can be daunting places and you can feel the same as an adult as you did as a child \u2013 not being good enough, fit enough, strong enough,\u201d says Thompson Rule. If being shouted at in a HIIT class isn\u2019t working for you \u2013 or brings back bad memories \u2013 do something else.\n\n\u201cIf you keep forcing yourself to do something you\u2019re really not enjoying, it\u2019s going to become another source of stress,\u201d says Lewin. \u201cYou\u2019ll give up and come back to that old idea of: \u2018I\u2019m not sporty.\u2019 That\u2019s not the case. You just haven\u2019t found what\u2019s right for you.\u201d", "description": "Bad memories of PE can give people the lifelong impression they\u2019re not cut out for sport.
