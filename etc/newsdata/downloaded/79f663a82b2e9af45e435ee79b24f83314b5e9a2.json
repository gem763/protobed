If a teammate is in a better position than me to score, I will pass the ball to him,\u201d he stressed.\n\n\u201cI dedicate this victory to the wonderful Chiefs supporters, who travelled to Pretoria in tens of thousands to cheer us on.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Spectators arrive late \u2013\n\nThe late arrival of many spectators at Loftus Versfeld \u2014 a ground Sundowns share with Super Rugby club Northern Bulls \u2014 meant the kick-off was put back 15 minutes.\n\nUnlike most African countries, where supporters fill stadiums hours before the kick-off, South African football fans are notorious for arriving late and forcing matches to be delayed.\n\nChiefs\u2019 German coach Ernst Middendorp urged caution as the club hunt a first trophy since winning the 2014/2015 Premiership under English handler Stuart Baxter.\n\n\u201cWe are getting used to winning league matches this season,\u201d he said, referring to seven victories in nine outings since the championship kicked off two months ago.\n\n\u201cBut we have 21 more fixtures to play so it is crucial that all of us \u2014 players, coaches, technical staff, management and supporters \u2014 keep our feet firmly on the ground.\u201d\n\nAsked what had changed a team that finished a humiliating ninth last season into league pacesetters, Middendorp said greater squad depth was a major factor.\n\n\u201cWe have competition for places throughout the squad and that is vital. It is one of the reasons why Sundowns have been so successful at home and in Africa in recent years.\n\n\u201cOur first choice goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune, one of the best in Africa if not the best in my opinion, is injured and Nigerian Daniel Akpeyi is proving a great replacement.\u201d", "description": "Johannesburg (AFP) \u2013 Serb Samir Nurkovic returned from injury to score the goals that gave leaders Kaizer Chiefs a 2-0 South African Premiership", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/3b1d38_kaizer-chiefs-two-goal-star-samir-nurkovic-is-pursued-by-tebogo-langerman-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
