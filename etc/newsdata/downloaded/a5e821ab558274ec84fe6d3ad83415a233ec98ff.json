DSEI is a moral disgrace and should be firmly opposed, whether it is taking place in London or anywhere else.\n\n\u201cIt will bring a roll call of the world\u2019s most repressive regimes together with all of the biggest arms companies. They will be there for one reason: to sell as many weapons as possible, regardless of the consequences.\u201d\n\nThe event is supported by the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Trade, which has a wing dedicated to arms exports.\n\nBritish defence giant BAE Systems is listed as a \u201cplatinum partner\u201d alongside American firm General Dynamics, while the United Arab Emirates will have its own pavilion.\n\nThe country is part of a Saudi-led coalition bombing Yemen in a campaign that has killed an estimated 8,000 civilians and driven a deadly cholera outbreak and famine.\n\nGovernment figures show that export licences worth \u00a36.2bn have been granted to members of the Saudi-led alliance in the four years since the conflict began in March 2015.\n\nIn a letter to the Royal Docks Management Authority, which runs the ExCeL, Mr Khan said he was \u201copposed to London being used as a marketplace for the trade of weapons\u201d.\n\nThe local authority, Newham Council, also opposes DSEI being held at the conference centre and is holding an \u201calternative peace exhibition\u201d hosting campaigners and politicians on Tuesday.\n\nRokhsana Fiaz, the mayor of Newham, called the arms fair \u201cabhorrent\u201d after the council passed a motion \u201crejecting the economic arguments cynically deployed in defence of this trade\u201d.\n\n\u201cNewham is a very diverse borough and many of our communities have links across the globe to those areas that have been affected by conflict, displacement and the horror of war,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis council is doing everything we can to prevent the DSEI coming to Newham ever again.\u201d\n\nIn a response to Mr Khan\u2019s letter, DSEI event director Grant Burgham said it \u201cplays an important role in supporting the Ministry of Defence\u2019s procurement needs, helping deliver British jobs and economic growth, and deepening the UK\u2019s partnerships on a global stage\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe event serves only the interests of the legitimate defence and security industry, which is the most highly and tightly regulated in the world,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cGovernment agencies responsible for enforcing the law at DSEI are on site during setup and throughout the exhibition.\u201d\n\nMr Burgham said all security costs incurred as a direct result of the event would be met by DSEI, and that organisers \u201cfully respect the right to lawful protest\u201d.\n\nThe government is fighting a Court of Appeal ruling that found its continued licensing of weapons to Saudi Arabia \u201cirrational and therefore unlawful\u201d in June.\n\n\u201cThe UK operates one of the most robust export control regimes in the world,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe government undertakes a stringent process of scrutiny and approval before issuing any formal invitations to foreign governments to attend a major UK defence exhibition like DSEI.\u201d", "description": "Sadiq Khan has told organisers of the world\u2019s largest arms fair to move it out of London as protests mount over the \u201cabhorrent\u201d event.
