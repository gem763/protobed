The Cairns couple had already grown concerned that Mitch and Mark\u2019s so-called party room could put off potential buyers.\n\n\u201cHaving the spa on the rooftop, basically that\u2019s us putting the last nail in the coffin,\u201d Tess said, mournfully.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s us just going: \u2018OK we are probably not even going to finish but you guys put a spa up there and make that whole level a party level.\n\n\u201cAnd we will just lay here and give up.\u2019\u201d\n\nMitch and Mark took Tess and Luke\u2019s decision as a declaration of war. And, even though they couldn\u2019t possibly get their spa across the line without a majority yes vote, they then pressured Matt and El\u2019ise to declare just where they stood.\n\nWhy? Because they wanted to know exactly who was for them and against them when they began taking revenge.\n\nThey need not have bothered asking. We all knew where El\u2019ise stood from the second she burst into tears just hearing the boys were getting a pool and she wasn\u2019t.\n\nIt was a flat no. And that\u2019s when the boys really went off the deep end.\n\n\u201cAt this point I couldn\u2019t care less about a spa,\u201d Mitch spat, with cold disgust.\n\n\u201cHaving a spa, not having a spa is irrelevant. At this point things on The Block changed. It\u2019s about the changes that are going to flow on from this decision.\n\n\u201cIf you f*** with us, I will f*** with you. End of story!\u201d\n\nExcept it wasn\u2019t the end of the story, not by a long shot. The boys then called all their tradespeople and told them they were no longer to help anyone else on The Block.\n\nWithin minutes the plasterers, who were due to start work on Tess and Luke\u2019s studio the next day, called Luke to tell him that Mitch and Mark had banned them from doing the job.\n\n\u201cThey have gone after us,\u201d Tess moaned.\n\n\u201cThey basically pulled our plasterers to prevent us from finishing. They kicked us when we were down.\u201d\n\nLater in the evening, Tess and Luke attempted to make peace with their neighbours but were coldly rebuffed with Mark telling them in no uncertain terms: \u201cGrow up and stop playing the victims!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not even going to finish this f\u2026ing thing,\u201d Mark hissed as he downed another spoonful of his sponsored microwave dinner.\n\n\u201cThree of your houses aren\u2019t going to be in the auction so what difference does it make what we do up there?\u201d\n\nMitch added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to help you. I have got no tears. Quite frankly, you broke me.\u201d\n\nThe showdown led to Tess and Luke inviting all the other teams around to their place for a drink (aka a gossip session about Mitch and Mark).\n\nJesse was incredulous at the boys\u2019 retaliatory measures.\n\nEl\u2019ise was furious that the boys had basically written them off as contenders.\n\nDeb and Andy said nothing mean about anyone, as usual. But it\u2019s clear that The Block is divided into two camps.\n\nAnd while Mitch and Mark (or B**** and Bark, as Luke has dubbed them) may well win The Block they won\u2019t be winning any friends out of the experience.\n\nMISSED AN EPISODE?\n\nEP 37 recap: Will Tess and Luke walk out?\n\n\n\nEP 35 and 36 recap: Reason for Tess and Luke\u2019s devastation\n\nEP 34 recap: Mitch puts his foot through the ceiling\n\nEP 32 recap: producer dragged into cheating scandal\n\n\n\nEP 30 recap: \u2018Dog\u2019s breakfast\u2019: kitchen savagely mocked\n\nEP 29 recap: Scott Cam gives contestants a serve\n\nEP 27/28 recap: Gloves are off as teams threaten to quit\n\nEP 26 recap: Tess and Luke flush another tradie\n\nEP 25 recap: Is this the best bathroom on the Block ever?\n\nEP 24 recap: Is this the best Block bathroom ever?\n\nEP 23 recap: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u201d \u2014 Mark and Mitch patch things up with Scott\n\n\n\nEP 22 recap: What made Scott Cam storm off?\n\nEP 21 recap: Homophobia row rocks The Block\n\n\n\nEP 19/ 20 recap: \u2018you just told me my baby is ugly\u2019\n\nEP 18 recap: Tess\u2019 expletive-filled tirade after tradie sacking\n\nEP 17 recap: Loo controversy sinks two teams\n\nEP 15/16 recap: What made Mitch snap?\n\nEP 14 recap: Jesse and Keith\u2019s blow up\n\nEP 13 recap: Judges slam Mark and Mitch\n\nEP 11/12: Big move may blow up friendship\n\nEP 10 recap: Why Scott Cam locked a contestant in car\n\nEP 9 recap: How Jesse insulted Shaynna\n\nEP 7/8: \u2018Don\u2019t be nice to them\u2019.
