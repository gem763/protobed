He formed Lupa after leaving 21st Century Fox, the media giant founded by his father, Rupert Murdoch. Last year, the family sold off the majority of Fox's assets to the Walt Disney Company for more than $US70 billion ($103 billion) .\n\nJames Murdoch has taken a stake in Vice Media.

He is also less interested in traditional news ventures, the person who is familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn August, Murdoch led a consortium of investors to buy a controlling stake in Tribeca Enterprises, which owns the Tribeca Film Festival as well as a production studio. He said he would work with Tribeca founders Jane Rosenthal and Robert DeNiro to expand the business.", "description": "Flush with cash from the sale of 21st Century Fox, the youngest of Rupert's sons has invested in a diverse group of media businesses that looks very different from the one his father founded.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_4.5152%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_63/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1e9167ceff927316c336878bf4540fcd64432690", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
