These Fleabag fans were living the fucking dream.\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge is one of those anomalies that is not only an incredible actress, but is also a super talented writer and just an all-round creative queen.\n\nThe play tells the story of a woman (Waller-Bridge) who is struggling to cope with her best friend\u2019s suicide while dealing with the general struggles of being a middle-class woman.\n\nBut the real zestiness came in season 2 earlier this year when Fleabag (Waller-Bridge) falls for a priest, played by Andrew Scott (Sherlock). In the show, Fleabag and \u201cHot Priest\u201d share a sneaky can of gin and tonic, because obviously he\u2019s not very good at the whole \u201cpriest\u201d thing.\n\nThe gin and tonic is a symbolic part of the relationship between Fleabag and \u201cHot Priest.\u201d So obviously, they had to get fans in on the action while they waited in line for tickets to the show.\n\n\u201cJust before the box office opened, Andrew Scott came out followed by Phoebe Waller-Bridge carrying boxes of M&S G&T, giving them away to everyone in the queue,\u201d a witnessed named Alexei told press. \u201cNo one could believe it was actually happening! Phoebe Waller-Bridge thanked everyone for waiting for hours and said that she hoped people would get tickets and would enjoy the show.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for some fans, the show sold out pretty quickly, but although they might\u2019ve missed out on a ticket, they at least have a great story to tell of their own.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/pjimage-20.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
