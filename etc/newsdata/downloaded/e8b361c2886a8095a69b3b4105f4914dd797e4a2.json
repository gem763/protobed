Roughly 28% of youth surveyed said they had recently used e-cigarettes, according to preliminary data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey.\n\n8th vaping-related death reported as illnesses soar past 500\n\n\"Walmart has taken a responsible step given the worsening youth e-cigarette epidemic and the growing number of severe lung disease cases associated with e-cigarette use,\" Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement. \"We urge them to make this policy permanent and to go further by ending sales of all tobacco products, including cigarettes.\"\n\nSellers of e-cigarettes market them as safer than traditional cigarettes, and some vaping advocates say concerns about the risks are overblown. The American Vaping Association on Friday slammed Walmart for halting sales of e-cigs while continuing to stock combustible tobacco products.\n\n\"You know you are in the middle of a moral panic when big corporations like Walmart find it easier to sell deadly combustible tobacco products than to sell harm-reduction alternatives,\" the group's president, Gregory Conley, said in a statement.", "description": "America's largest retailer cites mounting regulatory concerns in decision to stop carrying vaping product", "authors": ["Megan Cerullo"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/20/ad6aecb7-16bd-43dd-a21d-ae259dbbf22b/thumbnail/1200x630g2/fb52105b05c9c2cd7f8d485f7cded4af/gettyimages-1172039467.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
