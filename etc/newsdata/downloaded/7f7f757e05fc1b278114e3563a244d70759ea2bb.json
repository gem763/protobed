They ground things out rather than lighting up the Sapporo Dome.\n\nThe display will be of no importance if England go on and reclaim the Webb Ellis Cup in six weeks\u2019 time, but it has to be said the chariot spluttered into life on Sunday. And with Argentina and France looming on the horizon to decide who ultimately emerges from Pool C, England will need to show a big improvement in this tournament.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

But it did not take long for England to wrestle control of the match.\n\nIt has been a long time since Tuilagi scored in a World Cup: just two days short of eight injury-ravaged years since he crossed the line against Romania in Dunedin. But his return to international rugby has given England something special that they have lacked for far too long.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

This time, though, the hard work was done for him as Elliot Daly\u2019s perfect pass to Jonny May allowed the wing to gallop all of 30 metres, before committing full-back David Halaifonua and popping the ball to Tuilagi on his right shoulder for the centre to jog over.\n\nThough Farrell added a second penalty effort, the half-time lead could easily have been more than the 18-3 that it was, with Sam Underhill and Ben Youngs held up over the line \u2013 both requiring lengthy TMO reviews that sapped the energy out of the game.\n\nThe first half finished with something of a controversial moment, with Kalamafoni\u2019s thumping tackle on Anthony Watson causing referee Paul Williams to take a long look at the replay. It was a borderline tackle, with Kalamafoni\u2019s shoulder just missing the jaw of Watson. Between them, Williams and TMO Ben Skeen were happy to end the half without dishing out any punishment.\n\nAny hopes that the match would kick into life after the break failed to materialise, as England continued to just do enough to maintain their grip on the game. Farrell kicked another penalty early on to extend the lead to 21-3, but the tries that were expected to rain down from all areas did not come.\n\nEventually, the pressure told, and just like Australia the day before, the success came from going back to basics and trucking it up. Farrell sent a penalty to touch on the five-metre line, and the English pack demolished the Tongans as they steamrolled over the line to allow Jamie George to score with ease.\n\nEngland did manage to find something close to their stride late on, with replacement Jonathan Joseph breaking through the line after lazy tackling from a tiring defence, before releasing Luke Cowan-Dickie to go over for the fourth and final score. They should have bagged another, but Henry Slade\u2019s flashy no-show pass saw the ball flung into touch instead of Daly\u2019s waiting arms with the try line at his mercy.\n\nIt summed up the match perfectly.", "description": "Eddie Jones insisted before the Rugby World Cup that England do not need to be at their best until 2 November, which should come as a relief to his players after their run-of-the-mill 35-3 victory over Tonga.
