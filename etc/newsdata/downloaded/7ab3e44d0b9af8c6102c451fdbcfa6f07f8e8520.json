If we want to be at the top end of this league there needs to be greater efficiency,\u201d he said.", "description": "Leicester are third in the Premier League, and have secured more points at this stage than the season they won the title, but there was a stark message here from Brendan Rodgers.", "authors": ["John Percy", "Keith Hackett", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000213502117-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqTCCX6TN09Wsw953wy5SsXnWIiVIAFmcFRpLMwGzite4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
