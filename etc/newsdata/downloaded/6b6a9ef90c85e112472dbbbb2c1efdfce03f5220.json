But \u201cwhen Austin became a mini Silicon Valley, we were priced out,\u201d Kevin, a now-retired history teacher and principal, tells MarketWatch.\n\nHistory buff Kevin says he\u2019d always wanted to live in Europe \u2014 \u201cin a castle, specifically, but I let that part go,\u201d he jokes \u2014 and began hunting for where the couple might retire on his educator\u2019s pension. They considered more than a dozen countries, finally settling on Spain for a variety of reasons, including its relative affordability, good health care, and that his teacher\u2019s pension could qualify as income to help him get residency there.\n\nTo find the right spot, they toured Spain, rejecting Barcelona because it was too big; Tarragona because it was too far north (they wanted somewhere a little warmer); and Pe\u00f1iscola, because, though they liked it, Susan jokes, \u201cI could never tell my mother I lived in a town with that name.\u201d\n\niStock Denia, Spain\n\nThey found Denia, a coastal town where they now live, by accident: \u201cLooking at the map one morning, I noticed that a ferry from Ibiza docks at a place called Denia. I immediately thought that very interesting people go to Ibiza, and many must go by that route, so we should check out this place,\u201d Kevin, who has one grown child, explains.\n\nThey loved Denia for a number of reasons, including its historic architecture (there\u2019s even an ancient Moorish castle for Kevin to visit), great food (Unesco named it a Creative City of Gastronomy), four-season climate and coastal location. Plus, Susan adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a very family-oriented city with lots of celebrations.\u201d\n\nThey moved to Denia in 2016. Here\u2019s what their lives are like now, from costs, to health care to residency and downsides.\n\nThe cost: The Bryants say they live on Kevin\u2019s pension from being a teacher, and say they \u201clive very well on $2,000 per month.\u201d They spend about $665 on rent (they live in a two-bedroom apartment near the beach with a shared pool), $82 on electricity, $33 on water, $33 on internet, $44 on phone, $90 on gym, $130 on health insurance, $490 on food each month, they tell MarketWatch.\n\nKevin and Susan Bryant\n\nThe Bryants save money by not owning a car. They live on the bus line and say they spend about $30 a month taking the bus to and from town. (They note that a taxi home from a dinner out might cost them $12.)\n\n\u2018 Health care is the thing that will keep us from going back to the U.S. We can afford to grow old gracefully and see doctors here. It will not break us.\u2019 Kevin Bryant\n\nThey spend most of their extra money on travel, having recently hit up the Greek Isles and enjoyed many short trips through Spain. They point out that travel within Europe often isn\u2019t that pricey because flights are short and low-cost via regional carriers. And mostly they take bus trips to nearby towns like Valencia (about a $13 ride) and Benidorm ($5).\n\nHealth care: The Bryants say they spend roughly $130 for both of them for private health insurance each month \u2014 and they\u2019ve been very pleased with the quality of their care. \u201cI go to the freaking doctor here. I grew up male in Texas \u2014 we don\u2019t go to the doctor unless something is dangling off or broken,\u201d he jokes. \u201cAny time we need something now we go to see the doctor, we get in in a day or two,\u201d he adds, noting that \u201cour doctor is Dutch and speaks five languages \u2014 cool guy, too.\u201d Some expats may be able to qualify for the free state health-care system in Spain (here are the guidelines); expats who don\u2019t qualify for that \u2014 or who want to forgo the sometimes long waits that come with the public system \u2014 can buy private insurance to cover themselves. (You can read about the different health-care systems here).\n\nHe credits his great relationship with the doctor, and excellent experience with the Spanish health system, with catching the cancer spots on his face and head early and offering a treatment that was less than $100. \u201cIf I was still in the U.S., the cancer spots would still be growing because I wouldn\u2019t know it was there,\u201d he says.\n\nKevin and Susan Bryant.\n\nSpain is known for having quality health care: A study published in The Lancet on quality and access to health care puts Spain in the top 20 countries, above the United States, which was ranked 29th.\n\nThe Bryants are so pleased with the low cost and quality of health care in Spain that they say it\u2019s a major reason they\u2019ll never leave. \u201cHealth care is the thing that will keep us from going back to the U.S. We can afford to grow old gracefully and see doctors here. It will not break us.\u201d He adds: \u201cAs things stand, and as I see them standing into the future, health care costs in the U.S. completely preclude our ever returning to live there. It would be wonderful to have the option, but we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nResidency: The process of getting visas to move to \u2014 and now stay in \u2014 the country hasn\u2019t been smooth at all. When they initially went into the consulate in Houston in the hopes of moving, they came armed with all the paperwork they were told on the website that they needed \u2014 only to be informed that those papers weren\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cPeople from Spain were in there and heard the whole thing. I asked them, \u2018Is this the way it always is?\u2019 And they all started laughing and saying yes,\u201d Kevin says. It took them three trips to the Houston consulate to get their visas.\n\nNow they must get their visas renewed to stay in Spain, and Kevin says it has been \u201ca real hassle,\u201d adding that: \u201cWe eventually had to hire a lawyer and our case is in progress. Given another chance, I\u2019d hire the lawyer straight off and let them do all the work.\u201d Here is an overview of getting visas to stay in Spain.\n\niStock People eating and drinking at Els Magazinos market in Denia.\n\nThe cons: The hardest thing for both Kevin and Susan has been missing their family stateside.\n\n\u201cAfter that, lack of instant taste gratification. In a major U.S. city, almost any food craving can be satisfied at any time of day or night,\u201d Kevin says, adding that there is an upside to the lack of options in Denia though: That has \u201cmade me a much better cook as I attempt to replicate some tastes.\u201d But he jokes: \u201cI have failed to replicate one of my favorite dishes, cheese enchiladas in chile gravy.\u201d\n\nPlus, the language has been \u201can amusing challenge\u201d for the Bryants. Kevin studied Spanish in school and \u201ceven remembered some of it,\u201d he says. \u201cI expected to be fluent fairly quickly, but we moved to a place where many speak Valencian rather than Castilian, so my progress is slower than expected.\u201d Susan didn\u2019t have any Spanish language background, but she\u2019s taking classes and now says that while she can\u2019t converse that well, she can understand and read things better.\n\nBottom line: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more laid back here, people look out for one another,\u201d Susan says. But she adds: \u201cI love America and always will.\u201d", "description": "Though they \u2018love America,\u2019 this couple has chosen to put their roots down in the coastal town of Denia in Spain.", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT341_kevin__MG_20191015124417.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
