The Gazprom-led Nord Stream 2 company is headquartered in Switzerland. Both Switzerland and the EU are signatories of the treaty.\n\n\"Nord Stream 2 AG has now decided to ask the arbitral tribunal to determine that the European Union is in breach of its international law commitments under the [treaty] and to make orders requiring the EU to discontinue its breach,\" Sebastian Sass, Nord Stream 2's EU representative, said Thursday.\n\nThe notice of arbitration was served Thursday.\n\nThe EU's Gas Directive was revamped earlier this year and extends the bloc's gas liberalization rules to cover new offshore gas pipelines from non-EU countries. It's an effort to bring the contentious Russia-backed project \u2014 opposed by the Commission and many Central European countries but supported by Germany \u2014 under the EU's regulatory umbrella.\n\nNord Stream 2 argues the new rules discriminate against the project. The Commission says they do not.\n\nThe pipeline is to run 1,200 kilometers from Russia to Germany, but the new rules would only apply to the section of Nord Stream 2 in German territorial waters, a stretch of 54 kilometers.\n\nThe company also separately challenged the new rules before the EU Court of Justice.", "description": "Decision comes after the two sides failed to reach agreement.", "authors": ["Anca Gurzu", "Thibault Larger"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1148084856-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
