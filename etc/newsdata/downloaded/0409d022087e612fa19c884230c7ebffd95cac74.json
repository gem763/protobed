(Mark Brown/Getty Images)\n\nAnother week, another clipboard full of injuries. Let\u2019s get to it.\n\n\u2022 Rex Burkhead (foot) will not play at Washington. James White and Sony Michel theoretically pick up some extra work, and perhaps the Patriots will make room for rookie Damien Harris. Josh Gordon (knee) was not listed on the final injury report.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u2022 Tevin Coleman (ankle) had a limited practice week and is questionable for Monday's game with Cleveland. Just what we need, more viable options in the San Francisco backfield.\n\n\u2022 Saquon Barkley (ankle) remains week-to-week, and won\u2019t play against Minnesota. Wayne Gallman gets a tougher matchup than last week, but he still has a very high floor for touches.\n\n\u2022 Damien Williams (knee) is questionable for Sunday night's game against Indianapolis. It's a messy situation, with the late start and other quality players here. LeSean McCoy (ankle) is not on the injury report. Sammy Watkins (hamstring/shoulder) logged a partial practice Friday and is now listed as questionable. Be sure to double back for confirmation Sunday.\n\n\u2022 Terry McLaurin (hamstring) is a game-time decision, while Colt McCoy will be Washington\u2019s starting quarterback. The home team is a two-touchdown underdog against New England.\n\n\u2022 Sam Darnold (mono) isn\u2019t ready to return. Luke Falk gets thrown to the wolves at Philadelphia; perhaps the Eagles DST will be a good play here. The Jets get TE Chris Herndon back off suspension next week.\n\n\u2022 James Conner (ankle) isn\u2019t 100 percent, but he wasn\u2019t on the final injury report. He\u2019ll be the lead guy at home against Baltimore. Double-check Sunday on JuJu Smith-Schuster (toe), who is listed as questionable.\n\n\u2022 Michael Gallup (knee) will return against Green Bay, a boost to the entire offense and Dak Prescott in particular.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u2022 Marlon Mack (ankle) had a full practice Friday, suggesting he'll go Sunday at Indianapolis. T.Y. Hilton (quad) had partial work the last two days and is also trending in the right direction. Parris Campbell (abdominal) will not play.\n\n\u2022 The Bills consider Devin Singletary (hamstring) a game-time call at Tennessee. Figure on him needing some amp-up time either way; as much as I love Singletary long term, I'll keep rolling with Frank Gore for now. Buffalo does expect Josh Allen (post-concussion) to play.\n\n\u2022 Tyreek Williams (foot) missed the full week of practice, putting his status in doubt for the London game against Chicago.\n\n\u2022 Brandin Cooks is in the concussion protocol after taking a shot Thursday at Seattle. If he can't go Week 6, even with the extra time, Josh Reynolds is the next man up.\n\n\u2022 DeSean Jackson (abdomen) remains week-to-week. He won\u2019t play against the Jets.\n\n\u2022 Jamaal Williams (concussion) is out for the game at Dallas, clearing Aaron Jones to get bell cow work. Davante Adams (toe) is ruled out; Jake Kumerow is set as the third receiver.\n\n\u2022 Jarvis Landry is out of the concussion protocol, pointing to him playing Monday at San Francisco.\n\n\u2022 Christian Kirk (ankle) will not play against Cincinnati, which pushes KeeSean Johnson to possible deep-league value.\n\n\u2022 Mike Williams (back) is expected to play against Denver, and Melvin Gordon is expected to make his first appearance of the year, roughly in an even time-share with Austin Ekeler.\n\n\u2022 Tampa Bay took Chris Godwin (hip) off the final injury report, so lock and load at New Orleans.", "description": "The Rex Burkhead injury might clear things up in the New England backfield.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sphKalNbh8l7dvr2HSOKKw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MDAuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/msSpEOvGxrUn5FXPTLUafA--~B/aD0yNDY1O3c9MzUwNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/84b6e4b0-e7bb-11e9-af3b-03524f5a3843", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
