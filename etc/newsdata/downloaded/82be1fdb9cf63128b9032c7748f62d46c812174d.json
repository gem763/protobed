Also, earnings decreased 29% sequentially and 22.5% year over year.\n\nThe earnings decline was a result of heavy investment in the cloud-computing business, artificial intelligence and consumer hardware.\n\nNet revenues, excluding total traffic acquisition cost or TAC (TAC is the portion of revenues shared with Google\u2019s partners, and amounts paid to distribution partners and others who direct traffic to the Google website), came in at $33.01 billion. The figure was up 4.1% sequentially and 21.5% year over year.\n\nNet revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.52%.\n\nFollowing the weaker-than-expected third-quarter results, Alphabet\u2019s share price was down 1.63% in the after-hour trading session.\n\nNotably, primary drivers of the Google business haven\u2019t changed. Yet, pricing remains under pressure, both on account of nagging FX concerns, and continued strength in mobile and TrueView.\n\nNonetheless, Google continues to enjoy strength in the mobile platform. Management is focused on driving mobile experiences and the company is well positioned to pick up strong intent-to-buy signals by studying mobile searches from the huge database. As a result, direct response marketers continue to show interest in it.\n\nThe company stated that Google Cloud is recording substantial revenue growth, and it will continue to invest in this space.\n\nYouTube, which remains a strong contributor to the company\u2019s growth, is benefiting from improvement in online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged in the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers every day. However, time and again it faces continuous pressure from advertisers to tighten controls on the fast-growing YouTube video service, in a bid to avoid adult or offensive content.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\n\n\n\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise More\n\nNumbers in Detail\n\nRevenues\n\nGross total revenues of $40.5 billion increased 4% sequentially and 20% year over year (up 22% in constant currency). The increase was primarily driven by strength in ad revenues, reflecting strong demand for the company\u2019s search, video and web display ads.\n\nGoogle Segment\n\nThe segment includes search, advertising, Play, hardware, and Cloud & Apps.\n\nComing to the search business, revenues from Google-owned sites were up 4.8% on a sequential basis and that of partner sites increased 0.1%, resulting in a 4% increase in total advertising revenues.\n\nGoogle-owned and partner sites grew 19.1% and 7.5% year over year, accounting for 70.7% and 13% of quarterly revenues, respectively. This resulted in a year-over-year increase of 17.1% in total advertising revenues.\n\nIn addition, Other revenues increased 4% sequentially and 38.5% year over year, accounting for 15.9% of third-quarter revenues.\n\nOther Bets Segment\n\nOther Bets revenues were $155 million, down 4.3% sequentially but up 6.2% year over year, accounting for 0.4% of total third-quarter revenues.\n\nTotal traffic acquisition cost or TAC was up 3.5% sequentially and 13.8% year over year.\n\nTAC paid out to network partners increased 0.4% sequentially and 6% year over year. Given the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC, the increase in mobile search revenues is driving related TAC, according to management.", "description": "Alphabet (GOOGL) reports weak third-quarter earnings due to heavy investment in the cloud-computing business.", "authors": ["Zacks Equity Research"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/liqBBfqMfIvrV3pAZp8Img--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/2d25d59cd286a207091f502c8551921a", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
