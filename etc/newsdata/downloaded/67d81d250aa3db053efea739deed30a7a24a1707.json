Bowen was said to have learning difficulties and a suspended prison term was imposed for the incitement offences.\n\nAt the time of sentencing in November 2017, Judge Rhys Rowland described Bowen as 'small in stature and emotionally inadequate' and said he would have a 'very hard time' in prison.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to two counts of inciting a child to carry out a sex act, and was given a 48-week prison sentence, suspended for two years and given a sexual harm prevention order, and placed on the Sex Offenders Register.\n\nToday at Mold Crown Court, a three months suspended jail term was imposed with a rehabilitation activity for the breaches of the order imposed in November 2017.\n\nJudge Niclas Parry told Bowen at Mold Crown Court : 'These orders aren't made for the sake of them. They are made to protect the public and, in particular in this case, young females.'\n\nToday, at Mold Crown Court three months suspended jail term was imposed with a rehabilitation activity for the breaches of the order\n\nHe said : 'On this occasion, quite deliberately for your own reasons, you breached the order and went a step further and were hiding the use you were making of a device.'\n\nHowever, the previous court orders seemed to be having a good effect.\n\nJudge Parry added to the defendant : 'I think you have learned your lesson and you also have the tools to understand the importance of these orders. Don't do it again.'\n\nForfeiture of the phone was ordered. The judge said Bowen could get on with his life if he used a mobile phone lawfully.\n\nPaulinus Barnes, prosecuting, said police received information twelve months ago that Bowen was using a mobile phone. He had denied having it but was caught out when he answered a call from a policewoman.\n\nBowen, of Welshpool, mid Wales, said he'd 'panicked' and had deleted the internet history. The judge said the defendant had been viewing porn.\n\nDefence barrister John Hedgecoe declared : 'There's no harm in this case.'", "description": "Bryan Bowen, 28, of Welshpool, mid Wales,\u00a0said he'd 'panicked' and had deleted the internet history.
