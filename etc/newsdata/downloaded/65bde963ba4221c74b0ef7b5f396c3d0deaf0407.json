Who wants to come for a ride with me?\u201d - a stark contrast to his apparent commitments to protect the planet.\n\n(Image: XPB Images/Press Association Images)\n\nIn 2013 he purchased a candy red jet, believed to have cost \u00a325m, which he frequently posted pictures of himself and his bulldog Coco flying between London and L.A. He sold the aircraft, which was named in the notorious paradise papers, earlier this year.\n\nHamilton switched to a plant-based diet in 2017 and in September he helped launch a vegan burger restaurant in London.\n\nIn an earlier post he said: \u201cPollution coming from the amount of cows are being produced is incredible. The cruelty is horrible and I want an healthier life.\n\n\u201cThey say it is more than what we produce with our flights and cars, which is kind of crazy I think.\u201d\n\nHamilton wrote: \u201cHey world, I hope everyone\u2019s enjoying their day. I\u2019m sad right now with the thought of where this world is going.\n\n\u201cExtinction of our race becoming more and more likely as we over use our resources. The world is a messed up place. World leaders either uneducated or don\u2019t care about the environment at all.\n\n\u201cAgriculture farming is the largest pollutant (sic) we currently have by over 50 percent, far more than our travel industry combined. I\u2019m sad to see so many people, even close friends ignore what is happening daily.\n\n\u201cEducation is key and we were taught that eating animal products was good for us but we\u2019ve been lied to for 100s of years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken me 32 years to understand the impact I am having on the world and I\u2019m figuring out daily what I can do to play a better part. I want my life to mean something and honestly up until now my life\u2019s had no meaning.\n\n\u201cBeing a part of the issue is not meaningful. Being part of the solution is and I\u2019m striving to do better.\n\n\u201cI urge you to do some research, find the compassion I know you have within you to recognise what you are contributing to in terms of what you eat which keeps the meat and dairy industry flourishing and therefore deforestation, animal cruelty, our seas and climate decaying on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cGo vegan, it is the only way to truly save our planet today. It can be done so quickly, all you have to do is put your mind to it.\n\n\u201cHonestly I feel like giving up on everything. Shut down completely. Why bother when the world is such a mess and people don\u2019t seem to care. I\u2019m going to take a moment away to gather my thoughts. Thank you to those of you who do give a damn about the world.\u201d", "description": "The racing driver switched to a plant-based diet in 2017 \nand in September he helped launch a vegan burger restaurant in London", "authors": ["Nada Farhoud", "Image", "Xpb Images Press Association Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586582.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Lewis-Hamilton-File-Photo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
