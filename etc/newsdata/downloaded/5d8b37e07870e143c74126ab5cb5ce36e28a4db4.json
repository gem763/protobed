It also sets a global precedent and there is nothing more pressing, globally than the climate emergency.\u201d\n\nWilby clarifies that Extinction Rebellion does not want to put an end to the fashion altogether, but is \u201csimply calling for a response that is appropriate to the climate crisis we are in\u201d.\n\nIn order to get their message across, the activists will be taking part in several protests \u2013 which they call \u201cswarms\u201d \u2013 during the five-day event. These will take place outside key shows and close to the BFC\u2019s main show space at 180 Strand.\n\nThe protests will culminate in an \u201cRIP London Fashion Week Funeral March\u201d on Tuesday 17 September, which will begin in Trafalgar Square at 6pm.\n\n\u201cWe call on all citizens, including the industry itself, to demand an end to London Fashion Week,\u201d the event\u2019s description reads on Facebook. \u201cJoin us for a funeral for LFW on the 17th of September, which will pay respect to its legacy and put it to rest forevermore. This will be a time to pause and reflect on the lives already being lost and that will be lost as a result of climate and ecological breakdown.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion claims that the BFC is fully aware of its plans to disrupt the week and that it has already had a \u201cwarm and positive\u201d meeting with them.\n\n\u201cThey made it clear that they see London Fashion Week as a platform for cultural expression \u2013 and if culture was expressing itself through concern for environmental breakdown, then that was a valid part of the narrative,\u201d Jacobs says.\n\n\u201cBut, obviously, we\u2019d like to see so much more from them. As a race, we are \u2013 quite literally \u2013 facing the End of Days. In that context, no amount of conversation can be enough.\u201d\n\nThe Independent has contacted the BFC for comment.", "description": "As the fashion industry gears up for London Fashion Week and designers prepare to show their new collections to the world, one group is calling for the event to be cancelled.", "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/14/gettyimages-1137873250.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
