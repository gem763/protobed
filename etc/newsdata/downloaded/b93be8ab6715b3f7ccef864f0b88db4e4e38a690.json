For the fourth consecutive time under Chairman Jerome Powell's tenure, the vote was not unanimous, with Esther George and Eric Rosengren voting for no change to the benchmark rate. George and Rosengren have now dissented in three straight meetings, preferring to hold rates steady each time. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who dissented last time in favor of a 50-basis-point cut, voted for the single cut this time. As a reminder, there was no new projections or dot plot released for this meeting.\n\nThe current rate cut was arguably not controversial, with markets largely pricing in a cut. Instead, the big question heading into the meeting centered around how many cuts the Fed views as necessary to \u201csustain the expansion.\u201d In other words, would the Fed provide any clues about this likely being the last cut for now, or, if it believed that more cuts are necessary. To this end, the Fed removed the \u201cact as appropriate to sustain the expansion\u201d language in its latest release, and simply stated, \u201cThe Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal-funds rate.\u201d This was the key wording change in the statement and will likely be interpreted as a signal that the Fed believes rates are around where they should be given the current economic backdrop. In the press conference, Powell stated that the FOMC now views the current policy stance as likely to remain appropriate, which further bolsters this interpretation. He did admit that this was open to re-evaluation in the face of changes in the data, but he emphasized that they think the risks to the downside have moved in a positive direction. As such, we think a base case of \u201cno more cuts for now\u201d seems very reasonable.", "description": "We think a base case of \u201cno more cuts for now\u201d seems very reasonable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/bltf5c9f6de4daaa773/5cb4f480fe8386be234ac8fb/QuarterEndReview_Sectors_Bars_1x1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
