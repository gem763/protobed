Chinese officials in Kabul also did not immediately respond to a messaged request for comment.\n\nAfghanistan will this coming week hold its fourth presidential elections since U.S.-led forces toppled the Taliban from power in 2001.\n\nThose elections have gained importance since the collapse of the peace talks, as the negotiations could have led to the creation of an interim government, now a more distant prospect.\n\nIn June, before the peace talks fell apart, another Taliban team went to China to meet with the government.\n\nAt the time, a foreign ministry spokesman said China supports Afghans resolving their problems themselves through talks, and the visit was an important part of China promoting such peace talks.\n\nChina\u2019s far western Chinese region of Xinjiang shares a short border with Afghanistan.\n\nChina has long worried about links between militant groups and what it says are Islamist extremists operating in Xinjiang, home to the mostly Muslim Uighur people, who speak a Turkic language.\n\nChina, a close ally of Pakistan, has been deepening its economic and political ties with Kabul and is also using its influence to try to bring the two uneasy neighbors closer.", "description": "A Taliban delegation met China's special representative for Afghanistan in Beijing on Sunday to discuss the group's peace talks with the United States, a spokesman for the Islamist insurgency said.", "authors": ["Abdul Qadir Sediqi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
