Martin Sandoval\u2019s Capitol office in Springfield, his district office in the Chicago suburb of Cicero and his Chicago home. The Chicago Tribune reported that a man who answered the door at Sandoval\u2019s home said he was not home.\n\nThe suite door to Sandoval\u2019s office would not open when an Associated Press reporter tried to enter at around the time the raid was taking place. Attempts to reach Sandoval by phone were unsuccessful.\n\nSeveral men in dark suits and ties could be seen walking from the Senate Democrats\u2019 side of the Capitol, carrying the bags and boxes of materials. The word \u201cevidence\u201d could be seen written across at least one of the bags. Photos from some media outlets also showed people carrying boxes from his home.\n\nSandoval, 55, has served in the Senate since 2003, representing a district on Chicago\u2019s southwest side. He is chairman of the powerful Transportation Committee and was a driving force behind a 19-cents-a-gallon increase in the gas tax to help fund Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s $45 billion capital construction plan to rebuild roads, bridges and schools.\n\nRepublicans criticized him in August when a photo from a fundraiser appeared on social media showing what appeared to be a mock assassination of President Donald Trump. Sandoval later said neither he nor his staff was aware that an entertainment vendor had a beverage dispenser shaped like a rifle and pointed it at someone wearing a Trump mask. He expressed \u201cmy deepest regret that this unfortunate incident took place at (an) event in my name.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear whether Sandoval\u2019s work on the gas tax plan or his fundraiser had anything to do with the raids.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Illinois have brought several high-profile corruption cases this year.\n\nIn August, state Sen. Thomas E. Cullerton pleaded not guilty in Chicago federal court to charges that he took more than $250,000 in salary and benefits over a three-year period from the Teamsters while allegedly doing little or no work.\n\n\u2022 Tarm reported from Chicago.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "FBI agents carried materials in bankers' boxes and grocery bags out of the Illinois Capitol building on Tuesday, and multiple media outlets reported that and other raids were linked to a Democratic state senator.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John O'Connor", "Michael Tarm"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/04/12/trump_border_illinois_95049_c0-103-3000-1852_s1770x1032.jpg?7e74eb39ca338b05ab343462bd4fd41b6dcffb62", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
