Irregular expenditure incurred by National Treasury amounted to R466m and R454m was incurred by SARS,\" Kestlmeier said.\n\nKestlmeier said the majority of the irregular expenditure was caused by a lack of proper adherence to procurement processes. Kestlmeier said uncompetitive and unfair procurement processes were found at 47% of the auditees.\n\n\"When it comes to supply chain management, we found that contracts awarded differed from original invitations for bidding and contracts extended or modified without approval of a delegated official,\" Kestlmeier.\n\nKestlmeier said instability and prolonged vacancies in key positions had the potential to cause competency gaps and that this had a negative effect on audit outcomes.\n\nOver the past five years, the audit outcomes in the National Treasury portfolio regressed from 44% unqualified audits with no findings in the 2014/15 financial year to just 25% in 2018/19.", "description": "The state entities which fall under National Treasury incurred a combined R1bn in irregular expenditure in the 2018-19 financial year - with the biggest contributors being SARS and Treasury itself.", "authors": ["Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5164/0a495a648b0848d7aa3a21987b8e5d0c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
