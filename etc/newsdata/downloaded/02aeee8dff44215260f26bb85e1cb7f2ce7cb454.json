Ovechkin, who also had two primary assists Tuesday, has 11 goals in 14 games.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAmazing,\u201d Coach Todd Reirden said of Ovechkin\u2019s career total. \u201cIt\u2019s not any secret of how he scores his goals, and it just \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to stop. He\u2019s one of a kind for sure.\u201d\n\nLast week, Ovechkin talked about how hard it is to score in hockey\u2019s modern era, given the players\u2019 skill and speed. He\u2019s still more than 200 goals behind Wayne Gretzky\u2019s NHL record of 894, but he hasn\u2019t slowed at all so far this season.\n\n\u201cHe continues to amaze not only hockey fans throughout the world but players in our room, and that is when you know you really have respect and you are doing something special \u2014 when guys on the bench shake their head,\u201d Reirden said.\n\nAD\n\nNext up for Ovechkin on the all-time list: Teemu Selanne with 684 goals.\n\nIn a penalty-ridden game \u2014 there were 17 minors between the teams \u2014 Ovechkin cashed in during a rare five-on-four in overtime after the Maple Leafs committed a pair of infractions. Ovechkin missed on a few tries from his office seconds earlier, but his teammates kept feeding him, and he broke through to cap a back-and-forth game.\n\nAD\n\nAuston Matthews gave the Maple Leafs a 3-2 lead with his second goal of the night early in the third period, but Ovechkin came right back less than three minute later to tie it.\n\n\u201cI think you can see, all the guys played hard,\u201d Ovechkin said.\n\nWhile Ovechkin keeps moving closer to milestone after milestone, defenseman John Carlson is setting records of his own. He continued to make an early-season case for the Norris Trophy, given to the NHL\u2019s top defenseman, with a pair of goals.\n\nAD\n\nWith 23 points in 14 games, Carlson set the franchise record for points in a month by a defenseman. He posted the second-most October points by a defenseman in NHL history; only Al MacInnis (25) with Calgary in 1990 had more. Carlson (426) also tied Kevin Hatcher for the third-most points by a defenseman in Capitals history.\n\nAD\n\nThe Capitals\u2019 first goal came after an indirect pass from Ovechkin went off the sideboards and onto Carlson\u2019s waiting stick in the faceoff circle. His wrister at 10:47 went top shelf past goaltender Frederik Andersen to tie the score at 1; the Capitals had allowed Toronto\u2019s Andreas Johnsson to score 40 seconds into the game.\n\nCarlson\u2019s second goal came at 7:59 of the second period, six seconds into a five-on-three power play. Ovechkin and Nicklas Backstrom had the assists; Backstrom finished with three. Matthews tied the score on a deflection \u2014 his 11th goal in 14 games, just like Ovechkin \u2014 in the final minute of the period and put Toronto ahead early in the third, but the Capitals\u2019 captain made sure his team closed its long road trip with another win.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe persevered as a group. We came together a lot on this trip, and I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s designed,\u201d forward Tom Wilson said. \u201cThat is why it is there. We had fun, and it\u2019s definitely good to get the last one.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNote: Capitals center Nic Dowd suffered a lower-body injury in the first period and was set to be reevaluated Wednesday. After trying to avoid a hit in the first period, he crumpled while holding his right knee. He was helped to the dressing room but could not put pressure on the leg as he left the ice. He came back onto the ice during the first intermission but then skated right back down the tunnel. Dowd has been fighting to solidify his spot as the fourth-line center after starting the season splitting time in the role with Chandler Stephenson.\n\nMore on the Capitals:\n\nAD", "description": "Ovechkin tied the score in the third period and had the winner in overtime of a 4-3 victory that gave Washington a 4-0-1 record on its 10-day road trip.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iWmB_NzfVTos-Isf32027aubcCI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A2IM4ZX2XQI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
