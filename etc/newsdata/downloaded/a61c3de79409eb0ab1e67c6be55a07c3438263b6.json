Solidarity with Stella Creasy, the way you are being targeted is disgusting.\u201d\n\nCaitlin Moran, a feminist author, said: \u201cThis is just shocking harassment of a pregnant MP \u2013 Stella Creasy \u2013 who has always defended womens\u2019 rights to choose whether they wish to be pregnant or not #defendstella. Graphic anti-abortion billboards in 21st century Britain.\u201d\n\nClare Coghill, the leader of Waltham Forest Council, said: \u201cI stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with fellow female politician Stella Creasy being targeted in this most appalling way.\n\n\u201cI defend anyone\u2019s right to lawfully protest but when it changes into the targeting of individuals in such a personal way, we must come together to say this isn\u2019t acceptable. This group was not started in this borough and it does not speak for the people of this area.\u201d\n\nGrainne Teggart, Northern Ireland Campaigns Manager for Amnesty UK, applauded Ms Creasy for campaigning \u201ctirelessly\u201d for women.\n\n\u201cEspecially those in Northern Ireland suffering under the near-total abortion ban, to have access to this healthcare service,\u201d she added. \u201cNo one should have to face abuse for doing their work, in this case for progressing such a pressing human rights issue.\u201d\n\nOfficial statistics show 12 abortions were carried out in Northern Ireland last year \u2013 with Amnesty International saying more than 900 women travelled from Northern Ireland to England or Wales to have their pregnancy terminated during the same period.\n\nThe vote to extend abortion to Northern Ireland was passed by 332 to 99 in July.\n\n\u201cHow much longer are the women of Northern Ireland expected to wait?\u201d Ms Creasy asked MPs at the time. \u201cHow much more are they expected to suffer before we speak up \u2013 the best of what this place does \u2013 as human rights defenders, not human rights deniers?\u201d", "description": "An advertising company has been forced to remove a \u201cdisgusting\u201d anti-abortion billboard campaign levelled at pregnant Labour MP Stella Creasy.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/28/20/stella-creasy-anti-abortion-protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
