(Ben Margot/AP)\n\nGolden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr still isn\u2019t ready to talk about the NBA\u2019s ongoing China issue, which probably suits league officials just fine. Ahead of Thursday night\u2019s preseason game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Kerr reiterated his stance that he\u2019s not educated enough on the issue to offer an opinion.\n\n\u201cGenerally, my feeling is the things that I\u2019m going to comment on are the things that I feel comfortable speaking about, things I feel well versed about. \u2026 There are places where I don\u2019t feel as comfortable. This would be one of them,\u201d he said.\n\nKerr said pretty much the same thing Monday night, when the controversy that has roiled the NBA all week was still in its relative infancy. This drew the derision of President Trump, who on Wednesday mocked Kerr for not having a take. Kerr, Trump said, was acting \u201clike a little boy\u201d and \u201cwas so scared to even be answering\u201d a question about the issue.\n\nThe Warriors coach, who has spoken out about a number of social issues during his tenure, didn\u2019t seem scared to answer a question about Trump\u2019s comments on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cI realize the horse was out of the barn a long time on this,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for me personally, this was my experience with, wow, has the office sunken low. My hope is that we can find a mature unifier from either party to sit in that chair and try to restore some dignity to the Oval Office again, and I think it will happen.\u201d\n\nSteve Kerr\u2019s full response to Donald Trump pic.twitter.com/UWkzuJKYpM \u2014 Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) October 11, 2019\n\nKerr\u2019s father, the president of the American University of Beirut, was assassinated by gunmen in Lebanon in 1984, when Kerr was a freshman at Arizona. On Thursday, Kerr pointed to the welcome he and his mother received at the White House from President Ronald Reagan following that tragedy to illustrate the gulf between then and now.\n\n\u201cI was thinking about my various visits to the White House,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI\u2019ve lived a privileged life and met, I think, the past five previous presidents prior to President Trump. The first one was in 1984, and Ronald Reagan was president. He invited my mom and me, six months after my dad was killed in a terrorist attack. President Reagan and Vice President [George H.W.] Bush invited us into the Oval Office, spent about half an hour with us thanking us for my dad\u2019s service \u2014 he was in education. Thanking us for my dad\u2019s commitment to American values in the Middle East. Trying to promote peace in the Middle East. And all I could think of last night was the contrast of what has happened in 35 years. There was no regard for whose side you were on politically. Political party, anything like that. It was just, you were an American. The office held such dignity and respect \u2014 both from the people who were visiting and especially the people who sat inside it. It\u2019s just sad it\u2019s come crashing down. That we are now living this.\u201d\n\nKerr also deflected criticism he\u2019s received from some corners about having opinions on social issues facing the United States as a whole but not the one involving the NBA\u2019s financially beneficial relationship with a nation that has a spotty human rights record.\n\n\u201cThe same people who are asking me to stick to sports are also asking me to expand my horizons,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing. Again, I will speak on the things I\u2019m comfortable with. I will do things I believe are helpful for my country. I love my country, despite what President Trump said yesterday. I work really, really hard on a lot of things off the floor. One of those things is I don\u2019t want people to feel what my family felt when my father was killed. I know what it feels like to have a family member ended by a bullet. So that\u2019s a passionate, passionate subject for me. So I research it, I\u2019m involved with various organizations, I\u2019m constantly meeting with people, fundraising. It\u2019s part of my life.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nGregg Popovich praises Adam Silver for \u2018courage\u2019 in China, takes a dig at Trump\n\nBrewer: It took an uncomfortably long time, but Adam Silver got it right on NBA and China\n\nBlackistone: While Adam Silver tries to straddle a line on China, the NBA misses an opportunity\n\nJenkins: Don\u2019t be mad at the NBA.
