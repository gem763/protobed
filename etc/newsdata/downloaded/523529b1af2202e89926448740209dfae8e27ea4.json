The party\u2019s support for agriculture supply management is an untenable sop to rural constituencies. His innumerable tax expenditure gimmicks and other vote-buying schemes are as deplorable as those of Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals and Jagmeet Singh\u2019s New Democrats.\n\nAll parties are guilty of vote-buying, and Scheer\u2019s Conservatives are no exception. Through the debate, however, only Scheer rose above the crowd on the three important issues of debt, climate and class warfare. While Trudeau, Singh and Green party leader Elizabeth May ripped into the \u201cpowerful corporations\u201d and the wealthy, raised extreme alarms about climate change, and ignored the risks of rising debt, Scheer held stable ground. At one point he even used the word \u201cfreedom\u201d to describe the essence of Canadian citizenship.\n\nOn the three main economic topics up for debate, Scheer offered the soundest policy options and ignored the extremist options offered by his opponents.\n\nClimate change\n\nScheer did not get sucked into the Trudeau/Singh/May climate alarmism rhetoric. Against claims from May on the alleged infallibility of climate science, and the alleged existential risk posed by global warming, Scheer stuck to his rational and responsible approach. His climate proposals stand in clear opposition to Trudeau\u2019s insistence that the Liberal carbon plan to meeting extreme global emissions targets are essential and will be successful.\n\nSetting carbon policy is an international problem that must be resolved internationally. Scheer\u2019s anti-carbon tax stance smacks of populism, but there are also good reasons to hold off on major and costly national carbon policies until the international conflicts and disagreements are settled and formal regimes are established \u2014 if they are ever established.\n\nEven if Canada were facing a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d with increasing floods, wildfires and storms \u2014 as claimed by May, Trudeau and Singh \u2014 no Canadian \u201cemergency\u201d carbon policy, carbon tax, pipeline shutdowns can change the world climate trajectory. It would all be symbolism with no real impact. Sheer is right in noting that if China, India and other nations are increasing their use of fossil fuels, increasing their carbon emissions and raising global climate risks, it makes no sense to charge ahead as though the future of the world depended on Canada\u2019s climate actions. The opposite is true: Canada\u2019s climate future depends on how the rest of the world acts.\n\nDebts and deficits\n\nScheer\u2019s full platform will reveal his fiscal plan, but so far he has indicated a commitment to a balanced budget over time and claims the Conservative platform will outline a sensible path forward toward balance. All such platform fiscal plans are suspect, but at least Scheer has indicated he intends to run a prudent fiscal plan.\n\nClass warfare\n\nThrough the debate, and in policy statements so far, Scheer has systematically avoided joining the creeping leftist push for the confiscation of the incomes and assets of the wealthy.\n\nTrudeau talks of a need to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes (whatever that means), although at least he has in the past resisted the idea of imposing a wealth tax on Canadian billionaires and multimillionaires. Jagmeet Singh plans to raise $5 billion a year via a one per cent wealth tax. During the debate, Singh repeatedly referred to \u201crich and powerful corporations\u201d and the wealthy who are \u201cnot paying their fair share.\u201d\n\nLooking forward, only Scheer offers the possibility that Canada\u2019s fiscal and economic future will be free of the wealth-confiscation and other extreme policies that are gaining support in Canada and the United States. Maxime Bernier\u2019s People\u2019s Party of Canada also suggests it might be a safe haven for fiscal and climate conservatives, but his immigration stance and vague policy outlines are too marginal for most Canadian voters.\n\nDuring the debate, Trudeau repeatedly denounced \u201cfear-based politics\u201d and the \u201cpolitics of fear and division.\u201d It was not clear who he was accusing of fearmongering, but it would be hard to pin that label on Scheer. On the contrary, as the debate ended, the Conservative was the only leader who did not engage in fear-based politics \u2014 over immigration, climate, wealth or any other issue.\n\nThere will be holes in the Conservative platform that will be released Friday. One of the biggest will be details regarding the plan to legislate a National Energy Corridor through which Ottawa will somehow impose national projects on provinces and regions. Should Quebec be allowed to continue to import oil, or should the province be forced to take in possibly more expensive oil from Alberta?\n\nOn the main issues of this election, however, the options are clear. Only Scheer stood out during the debate as the candidate whose platform rises above the radical and the extreme that Canada does not need.", "description": "In Monday's debate, the Conservatives offered the soundest policy options and ignored the extremist positions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/apjt-andrew_scheer-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
