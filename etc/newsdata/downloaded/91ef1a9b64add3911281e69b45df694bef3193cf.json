But it's more important that Johnson has added his voice to a virtual chorus of leaders who appear to have had enough of Thunberg since her angry speech at the United Nations last month, with \"how dare you\" as a refrain.\n\nAt the milder end of the reaction spectrum, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has disagreed with Thunberg about the urgency of radical climate action, saying technological advances would give humanity some extra time. French President Emmanuel Macron criticised Thunberg for \"radical positions\" that, he said, would only \"antagonise\" our societies, and said the environmentally aware governments of France and Germany aren't the ones she should be attacking.\n\nGreta Thunberg has taken her message of the need for climate change action to many world leaders; not all were as sympathetic as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Canadian Press\n\nAt the harsher end, US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, have been mocking and condescending. In contemptuous acknowledgment, Thunberg changed her Twitter profile. \"A very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,\" it read, repeating the language of Trump's sarcastic tweet. And after Putin described her as a clueless victim of adult manipulation, the bio temporarily changed to \"a kind but poorly informed teenager.\"\n\nThunberg clearly is capable of giving as good as she gets. The question is, however, whether her combativeness helps or hurts her cause. At some point in recent weeks, she appears to have crossed the line between eliciting sympathy and emanating menace. Many national leaders see it as their job to do as much for the environment as is politically feasible and economically reasonable; they don't take kindly to anyone who won't give them high marks for effort.\n\nThere's a clear line, too, between the Fridays for Future school strikes Thunberg started and Extinction Rebellion. Cutting school for the climate may have struck some parents as wrong, but it was easy to sympathise with children speaking up for their future. Street blockages by adult activists are a public nuisance that leave most people cold. That's why police, who didn't disrupt the Fridays for Future demonstrations, are breaking up these protests.\n\nThunberg may be personally fine with her growing status as a polarising figure. But polarisation tends to turn nasty very fast. In Rome, someone hanged Thunberg's effigy off a bridge, horrifying the mayor and other Italian officials. That goes far beyond disagreeing with the concept of climate change as an emergency.\n\nYouthful idealism is often inflexible, and it's not really about getting results. Thunberg has, at times, seemed different from the typical youthful rebel: She has carefully kept to the scientific consensus in her public utterances, and she's emphasised working toward goals set out in a political document, the Paris agreement on climate. That discipline has helped her get her message out as effectively as few activists have ever done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA little more acknowledgment that sympathetic politicians are at least trying to do something right, and a little less support for radicals, would perhaps disappoint some of Thunberg's more hotheaded supporters.\n\nThat, however, is likely the way to keep her message politically relevant - and to get moderate votes for Green parties, which are most likely to advance the climate agenda. Otherwise, activism in support of Thunberg's message could degenerate into the incoherence of antiglobalist protests, which have been loud and disruptive, but haven't led to any meaningful change.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "The Swedish teen's climate message could end up as incoherent as the anti-globalist movement.
