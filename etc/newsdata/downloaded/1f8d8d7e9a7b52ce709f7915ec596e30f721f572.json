In light of what the FDA has deemed a \u201cyouth epidemic\u201d of e-cigarette use, the administration has decided to move forward with a ban on flavored vaping products. This ban, they argue, will help curb youth use and protect America\u2019s teenagers.\n\nClearly, there is some sort of crisis with youth tobacco use in the country - no one is denying that. However, the FDA is withholding pertinent data that will provide the American people with the exact root cause of this crisis, which may end up being very different than what the current assumptions are.\n\nThe National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) is produced annually by the FDA and has served as the most comprehensive and timely compilation of data relating to youth use of tobacco. However, the most recent survey reflects findings from 2018, which was released many months before the flavor ban announcement.\n\nIt is not reasonable or in the best interest of the American people for the federal government to impose such an aggressive and blatantly anti-free market ban before the publication of the most up-to-date survey results. For that reason, 15 other consumer and tax policy groups to send a letter to the FDA urging them to publicly release the findings of the NYTS before taking any more steps with the proposed ban.\n\nThough the FDA has alluded to more recent and relevant data, the American people have yet to see the results of the 2019 studies. This begs a question -- why would the government move forward with a strong regulatory measure before releasing the materials to back it up?\n\nThe FDA claims to be a factually honest and completely statistic-driven organization, and while I don\u2019t doubt their good intentions, it is import to ensure that the presented facts remain applicable to the conversation, and that these facts are not outdated and irrelevant. Given that the data is fluid and vaping products are relatively new on the market, the timely release of the NYTS results is crucial to making informed decisions on the matter.\n\nGiven that the main point of contention around the e-cigarette conversation has specifically involved flavors, the most recent survey needs to show what brands and flavors kids in particular are choosing. Rather than making a blanket, overarching flavor ban, without knowing exactly what it is kids are using, the FDA should pinpoint exactly what are the preferred choices among young and inexperienced users, and then go from there. They should also show that the incidence of vaping has increasing, as claimed.\n\nUnderstanding the potential consequences of the flavor ban that are bound to unfold - such as a dark market of deadly counterfeit products and former smokers reverting back to old habits - it is imperative that the FDA use the most recent NYTS data in order to make sound regulatory conclusions. It is also equally as important that public health and policy experts be given access to that information as soon as it is available.\n\nIf President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump campaign slams Minneapolis mayor, Target Center for 'attempting to extort' them with rally security fees Susan Rice calls Trump decision to pull troops from Syria 'batshit crazy' Ex-Trump officials met with Zelensky campaign aides at Trump hotel earlier this year: report MORE chooses to move forward with this proposed regulation, I hope he does so with all possible data and statistics in his arsenal, in order to ensure that any enacted policy has a positive impact on our nation\u2019s youth. Unfortunately, that outcome will not be possible until the FDA comes forward with the 2019 NYTS results and shares their findings with the American public.\n\nProviding a comprehensive compilation of the facts to the public will provide transparency and assure that FDA regulators\u2019 and the administration\u2019s policies on vaping are well-informed and impactful for the whole country. American consumers deserve to know the facts.\n\nSteve Pociask is president and CEO of the American Consumer Institute, a nonprofit educational and research organization.
