In 1999, a year before the internet bubble burst, 28% of IPOs reported positive net income in the first year as a public company. That fell to 21% for companies going public in 2000.\n\nProfitability has been a key topic this year as a group of high-profile, money-losing private companies enter the public market. Investors are increasingly questioning the business model of growth at any cost, and taking weak demand, for WeWork especially, as a cautionary tale.\n\nUber went public in May, and reported a $1.8 billion loss ahead of its public debut. It revealed a $5.2 billion in the second quarter. Uber's ride-hailing rival Lyft, posted a 2018 loss of $900 million ahead of its March IPO. Both stocks are down more than 25% since their IPO date. WeWork would be the second-biggest money-loser in history if and when it goes public.\n\n\"In terms of a path to profitability, IPOs since 2010 look more like tech boom IPOs than offerings completed during the 2001-2009 period,\" Kostin said.", "description": "This year's initial public offerings are performing like it's 1999 \u2014 and not in a good way.", "authors": ["Kate Rooney"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105826661-1554151821246lyft.jpg?v=1567682611", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
