(Photo: ASIA WIRE/MAGAZINEFEATURES.CO.ZA)\n\nHeart-stopping CCTV footage has gone viral, showing a child falling from a high apartment building in China.\n\nThe boy was home alone when he climbed on a toybox and unlocked the burglar bars to the window.\n\nMoments later the 5-year-old, who'd managed to climb out of the window, could be seen clinging to a metal clothing rack - just a couple of seconds before he lost his grip and went plummeting to the ground.\n\nFortunately, Wang Hailin a security guard who works nearby, saw the boy hanging from the clothing rack and rushed to the bottom of the building with a blanket to break his fall.\n\n\"I looked up and saw the child hanging on the 4th-floor drying rack, so I threw down my mop, ran to the building, and borrowed a blanket from ground-floor residents,\" he recalled.\n\n\"Another passer-by helped me open the blanket, and the boy fell on it shortly after.\"\n\nThe incident which could've been fatal left the youngster, who is not in a life-threatening condition, with a minor head injury.\n\n(Photo: Asia Wire/magazinefeatures.co.za)\n\nSource: Magazine Features", "description": "Heart-stopping CCTV footage has gone viral, showing a child falling from a high apartment building in China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9299/5f64b40019d24c3bb412617bce49380e.png", "published_at": "2019-08-30"}
