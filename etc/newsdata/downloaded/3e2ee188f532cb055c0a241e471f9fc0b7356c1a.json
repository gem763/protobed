Calling it a \"pivotal moment,\" Trudeau said the choice Canadians make on Monday could have consequences for generations to come.\n\n\"We could wake up next Tuesday with a government led by a new leader. And the only way to prevent that from happening is to vote for the Liberal Party, to elect our great Quebec team, from all regions of the province, who share your values and your priorities and who understand your issues,\" he said.\n\nPressed by reporters on whether he considers defeat a distinct possibility, Trudeau said he was making it clear that this is an election that matters deeply to Canada and beyond, and that he is not taking any votes for granted.\n\nHe also was asked to defend his own party's campaign tactics.\n\nA recent tweet from senior campaign adviser Gerry Butts used a photo of Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer shaking hands with a construction worker to try to tie Scheer to the \"yellow vest\" movement, which began in France and has spread to other parts of the world, including Canada. Movement participants in this country have protested against immigration policies, the carbon tax and the United Nations Migration Pact.\n\nTrudeau dodged the question about the Butts tweet and accused the Conservatives of deploying the politics of fear and division.\n\n\"I think Conservatives need to continue to be called out for the nasty negative campaign that they are running, because Canadians deserve better,\" he said.\n\nTrudeau asked Quebecers to back the Liberal plan to fight climate change, and said Conservatives would rip up the only national climate plan Canada has ever had.\n\n\"Canadians get that, but Quebecers get that particularly well,\" he said. \"For the past 10 years, Quebec and B.C. have had a price on pollution. They've done more than their share.\"\n\nScheer has said his first act, if elected, would be to table legislation to scrap the Liberal carbon tax.", "description": "Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau today acknowledged the Conservatives could win Monday's election \u2014 and accused the party of winning support by running one of the \"dirtiest, nastiest\" election campaigns in Canadian history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5322520.1571235061!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/trudeau-montreal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
