It is \"a time of urgency,\" Pelosi said, because the president is threatening the Constitution.\n\nChairman Adam Schiff added that they are \"deeply concerned\" by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's apparent attempt to interfere in witness testimony during their impeachment inquiry. Any attempt to interfere in the process will be considered \"an obstruction,\" Schiff said.\n\nSchiff said they are cooperating very closely with House Oversight Committee Chairman Eli Cummings about Wednesday's subpoena for the White House.\n\nDespite the Democrats' impeachment proceedings, Pelosi said she hopes the president will still work with them on lowering the cost of prescription drugs and trade.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to find common ground with the president,\u201d she said.\n\n\"The ball is in his court,\" she insisted.\n\nORIGINAL POST\n\nHouse Democrats have threatened to subpoena the White House for documents related to the Ukraine controversy. They want the materials by Friday.\n\n\u201cOver the past several weeks, the Committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage with \u2014 or even respond to \u2014 the Committees,\" House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) said in a letter to his committee members.\n\nDemocrats launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump last month following the release of a whistleblower complaint accusing him of asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to interfere in U.S. elections. According to the whistleblower, Trump wanted Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his ties to Ukraine. The phone transcript showed that Trump did ask about Biden, but there was no evidence of quid pro quo as initially reported. In a press conference, Zelensky said \"nobody pushed\" him to do anything.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff will hold a presser Wednesday morning following the subpoena threat.\n\nGOP Leader Kevin McCarthy offered the Republican retort, accusing Schiff of launching a false and \"desperate\" campaign. McCarthy reminded us that in last week's intelligence hearing, Schiff parodied parts of Trump's phone call with Zelensky to try and incriminate him.\n\nChairman Adam Schiff has been lying to the American people for years. Now he is so desperate to damage the president that he literally made up a false version of a phone call.\n\n\n\nEnough is enough. I have signed a resolution to censure Schiff in the House of Representatives. \u2014 Kevin McCarthy (@GOPLeader) October 2, 2019\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Biggs (R-AZ) introduced the censure resolution against Schiff.", "description": ".10/02/2019 11:25:28AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/268/12744a3a-50de-4600-984a-540e4f20ad29.png"}
