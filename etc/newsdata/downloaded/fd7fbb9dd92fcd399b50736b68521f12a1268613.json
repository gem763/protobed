During the game with Vitoria, some fans were chanting Ozil\u2019s name.\n\nEmery appreciates their frustration but added: \u201cI know all the supporters want to know something more but now is not the moment. We\u2019ll decide when to say more.\u201d", "description": "Ozil is not featuring in Arsenal squads and Emery claims that permission was granted for him to wield the axe", "authors": ["Aaron Flanagan", "Image", "Nurphoto Pa Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20733038.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-v-Nottingham-Forest-Carabao-Cup-Third-Round.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
