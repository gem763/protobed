The film remains on track for the same release date in April 2020'.\n\nNumber three: His third Bond film, Skyfall, premiered in 2012 and is currently the highest-grossing film in the series\n\nNumber four: He reprised his role as James Bond in Spectre, which was released in 2015\n\nShaken, not stirred! Daniel let loose at the wrap party for his filming in Matera, southern Italy last weekend - where he was seen making an emotional speech while under the influence\n\nDaniel, who has been seen filming intense, action packed scenes in Italy for the eagerly-anticipated film, broke his steely demeanour as he let loose at the wrap party for his filming in Matera, southern Italy last weekend.\n\nThe 007 actor was seen making an emotional speech while standing around a delicious looking Bond-themed cake.\n\nDaniel admitted to his cast and crew that he was 'really quite drunk' before thanking them for 'all their hard work.'\n\nWith the party proving to be in full swing, Daniel garnered that attention of his company to commence his speech.\n\nSpeech: Standing around a Bond-themed cake, the 007 actor admitted to his cast and crew that he was 'really quite drunk' before thanking them for 'all their hard work'\n\nNever foregoing a smile on his face, the hunk confessed: 'I just want to say, and I am really quite drunk now so I won\u2019t go on for long, this has been the best, most wonderful experience I have ever had!\n\nCheered on by his guests, Daniel gushingly continued: 'You have all done the most amazing job. I could not be more proud to work with every single one of you.\n\n'I would like to thank you for this evening, for Barbara (Broccoli), for putting it on. Thank goodness, we did this tonight,' said the star as the camera panned to a yummy looking three-tier casino style Bond cake.\n\nMovie star: He had been seen filming intense, action packed scenes in Italy for the eagerly-anticipated 25th instalment of James Bond's 25th film No Time To Die\n\nDaniel Craig achieved international fame when chosen as the sixth actor to play Ian Fleming's British secret agent James Bond in the eponymous film series, taking over from Piece Brosnan in 2005.\n\nIt is unclear whether filming for No Time To Die has wrapped for the other actors involved. MailOnline has contacted representatives for James Bond for further comment.\n\nJust weeks ago, Daniel was seen gripping his co-star L\u00e9a Seydoux's hand as they leaped across a railway track\n\nSince Daniel announced he was standing down as James Bond, debate has raged whether the next 007 should be a woman, or black.\n\nAnd in July, The Mail on Sunday revealed that she will be both \u2013 thanks to the intervention of feminist TV writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge.\n\n'Popcorn dropping moment': Since Daniel announced he was stepping down in the next movie, British star Lashana, 31, will be given Bond's licence to kill in the 25th movie in the franchise\n\nIn what's been called a 'popcorn-dropping moment', British star Lashana, 31, will be given Bond's licence to kill in the 25th movie in the franchise.\n\nHowever, traditionalists can relax: she's not the new Bond, but a new character who takes over his secret agent number after he leaves MI6.\n\nThe story begins with Bond retired in Jamaica. But spymaster M \u2013 played by Ralph Fiennes \u2013 calls him back in desperation to tackle a new global crisis.\n\nA movie insider said: 'There is a pivotal scene at the start of the film where M says 'Come in 007', and in walks Lashana who is black, beautiful and a woman.\n\n'It's a popcorn-dropping moment. Bond is still Bond but he's been replaced as 007 by this stunning woman.\n\n'Bond, of course, is sexually attracted to the new female 007 and tries his usual seduction tricks, but is baffled when they don't work on a brilliant, young black woman who basically rolls her eyes at him and has no interest in jumping into his bed. Well, certainly not at the beginning.'\n\nThe source added that the phrase 'Bond girls' is now forbidden, saying: 'We were all told that from now on they are to be addressed as 'Bond women'.'\n\nDr Swann and Bond's romance, sparked in Spectre, appears to still be going strong in No Time To Die, with the pair sharing a passionate kiss during filming last week.\n\nNo Time To Die has a UK release date of April 3, 2020, and opens in the US on April 8, 2020.", "description": "Bond is back.
