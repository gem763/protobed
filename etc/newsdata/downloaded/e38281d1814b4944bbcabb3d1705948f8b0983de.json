This is the last time you're going to speak to them,' Headland said.\n\nMs Cheeseman said she considered Headland might kidnap the children but deep down thought he was going to harm them.\n\n'I just knew we needed help,' she testified.\n\nMs Cheeseman feared for her safety and decided against going to Headland's home with her friend, so they went to the police and spoke to a recruit, who then informed her superiors.\n\n'I thought they needed to go and make sure the kids were OK,' Ms Cheeseman said.\n\n'I thought that they would do it straight away.\n\n'I expected them to do what they're meant to do in those situations.'\n\nCounsel assisting the coroner Toby Bishop said the children's mother, Anatoria Takiwa, had gone to Joondalup police station to request a welfare check after she received a disturbing phone call from her estranged partner (pictured)\n\nAfter they had been at the station for about half-an-hour, the recruit spoke to Headland on the phone and he said he would bring the children there, so the women left.\n\nWhen Headland failed to arrive, the recruit unsuccessfully tried to call him, then called Ms Takiwa and was told Headland might be at the marital home in Yanchep, Mr Bishop said.\n\nThe recruit created a job in the police system and gave it a priority three, which meant police were required to respond within one hour.\n\nMs Takiwa's (pictured with her children) friend Katie Cheeseman was with her when she received that fateful call from Headland\n\nOfficers visited the home about 10.17pm, which was just under one hour, but three and a half hours since Ms Takiwa went to police with her concerns, Mr Bishop said.\n\nIn that fateful three and a half hours, the siblings' father drugged, strangled and killed them - and attempted to take his own life.\n\nCoroner Sarah Linton will consider the reasonableness of relying on Headland saying he would bring the children to the station.\n\nPolice communication methods will also come under the microscope, with the coroner set to examine the appropriate time officers should have been dispatched to check on the children.\n\nThe inquest continues.", "description": "Western Australia Police officers found the bodies of five-year-old Zaraiyah-Lily Headland and three-year-old Andreas Headland on a bed inside a Yanchep home on October 20, 2016.", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/09/20317148-0-image-a-5_1572340615462.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
