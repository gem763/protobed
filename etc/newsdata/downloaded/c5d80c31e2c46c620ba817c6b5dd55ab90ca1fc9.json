Late last week, he hoped to end the gatherings with a 60-day national emergency decree, temporarily rescinding press freedoms and the right to public assembly, but the marches have not abated.\n\n6:42 pm.

The fuel prices more than doubled, taking a disproportionate toll on poor and indigenous communities.\n\nThe new economic measures come in preparation for a $4.2 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved in March. IMF loan agreements often require recipient nations to reform internal economic policies before they are approved.\n\n\n\nAs\u00ed est\u00e1 #Ecuador el pueblo en la calle siga los detalles por @teleSURtvpic.twitter.com/vYfK3d7HUb \u2014 Madelein Garcia (@madeleintlSUR) October 8, 2019\n\nOn Monday, as protesters made their way toward Quito\u2019s presidential palace, where Moreno was expected to give an address, officials and journalists were suddenly ejected from the building by the military, reportedly as a security measure. Some were caught up in the massive police parameter around the palace, which included barbed wire and fences, and left stranded for some time with no way to leave.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udce2 #ATENCI\u00d3N\n\n\n\nMilitares evacuaron esta tarde a los funcionarios y periodistas del Palacio de Carondelet por seguridad. \u25ba https://t.co/xutHTEhIm3pic.twitter.com/Cz1OklB7U2 \u2014 El Universo (@eluniversocom) October 7, 2019\n\n#EnEsteMomento#URGENTE periodistas estamos en la calle, en las inmediaciones del Palacio de Gobierno.

Indigenous groups say they expect around 20,000 more demonstrators to arrive in Quito by Tuesday, many of them voyaging from southern parts of the country to partake in the protests. Videos have appeared on social media showing throngs of protesters as they marched toward the city.\n\n\n\nLike this story?
