The fetish is known as 'sounding'.\n\nA 22-year-old man had tweezers measuring 3.1inches (8cm) removed from his urethra four years after they got stuck inside. The x-ray of the pelvis shows the open ends of the tweezers 2.7inches (7cm) up from the end of his penis (the shadow)\n\nDoctors found the tweezers' closed end embedded in the bulbous urethra, near the top. The open ends were towards the external urethral meatus. To wiggle the tweezers out, a surgeon needed to apply pressure either side of the penis to 'close' the tweezers\n\nDoctors, led by Dr Mohamed Abouelazayem at Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, reported the tale in Urology Case Reports.\n\nThey said the man visited a clinic in Saudi Arabia 'with history of inserting a metal foreign body into his urethra four years ago'.\n\nIt is not clear why the object was inserted, but is usually due to a psychiatric issue, being drunk or sexually curious, the doctors said.\n\nThey added patients with this problem normally delay seeking medical help due to embarrassment or guilt.\n\nHe had never suffered any problems with urinating, had a fever or chills or any other symptoms, and tests revealed he was physically fine.\n\nAfter an X-ray, the man was taken into surgery where, under general anaesthetic, doctors were able to dig deeper to investigate the tweezers' position.\n\nThe found the closed end of the tweezers was embedded in the bulbous urethra, near the top.\n\nTo wiggle the tweezers out, a surgeon needed to apply pressure either side of the penis to 'close' the tweezers.\n\nThen the surgeons' own forceps were used to pull the tweezers out through the urethra.\n\nThe doctors wrote: 'At the end of the procedure, no urethral catheter was inserted, the patient voided well and went home post procedure.\n\n'The patient was recommended to undergo a psychiatric evaluation but he refused. The patient did not follow up with the outpatient department.'\n\nInserting an object into the urethra is rare, Dr Abouelazayem and colleagues wrote.\n\nHowever, Richard Viney, a urological surgeon at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, said he has seen plenty of foreign bodies stuck in the urethra during his career.\n\nHe told MailOnline: 'Almost all of them have been inserted for sexual gratification. Instrumentation of the urethra is called sounding.\n\n'I understand that it can be quite a pleasant experience once you get used to it but it is not something I would recommend due to the risk of injury, infection and subsequent stricturing (narrowing) of the urethra.\n\n'Among the things I\u2019ve seen was some telephone cable that knotted on itself in the bladder and couldn\u2019t be pulled out. Bic pens are a regular favourite.'\n\nOther objects reported in literature include fish hooks, metal roads, hairpins, screws, pellets, wires and wooden sticks.\n\nSome of the even more bizarre choices include straws, toothbrushes, household batteries, marbles, vegetables, squirrel tail and a piece of fish.\n\nMr Viney said: 'To use tweezers is clearly madness. He obviously lost control of them and once they were completely in the urethra and opened, the tips would act as barbs and make removal very challenging.\n\n'As they are stainless steel the patient has seen remarkably little reaction to them. Once removed I suspect there\u2019s a strong chance he will develop stricturing in time.'\n\nThe doctors concluded: 'Psychiatric consultation is recommended to prevent further attempts at insertion of other foreign bodies in the urinary tract.'", "description": "The man had not suffered any problems since he inserted the forceps himself.
