The Minneapolis Star Tribute reported that demonstrators were stopping cars leaving the venue and confiscating pro-Trump memorabilia, including flags and hats.\n\nAnti Trump protestors in Minnesota stole about 40 hats off the heads of Trump supporters & then lit them on fire \ud83d\udd25 at the Trump Rally\n\n\n\nThey then left the ashes as a vigil against fascism, leaving a f*ck Trump sign on the top of the pile\n\n\n\nThis is tolerance.

In several videos, protesters can be heard shouting \u201cf**k Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cf**k you guys\u201d when officers showed up to put out the blaze.
