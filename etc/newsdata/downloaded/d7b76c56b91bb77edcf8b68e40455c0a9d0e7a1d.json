Under higher emissions scenarios, the runoff zone nearly triples in size,\u201d said lead researcher Mike MacFerrin from the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nThis could contribute to between an extra half inch to three inches of sea-level rise, the study found. This is in addition to other sources of sea-level rise in Greenland such as calving icebergs.\n\n\u201cAs the climate continues to warm, these ice slabs will continue to grow and enhance other meltwater feedbacks,\u201d said co-author Mahsa Moussavi, a researcher from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). \u201cIt\u2019s a snowball effect: more melting creates more ice slabs, which create more melting, which, creates again more ice slabs.\u201d\n\nNormally meltwater percolates downwards, freezing before it runs off into the sea. However, as Arctic melting becomes more extreme these ice layers expand and solidify into mammoth slabs up to 16 metres thick which creates an impermeable layer just beneath the surface.\n\nMeltwater cannot pass through these shelves so it flows downhill along them until it reaches the ocean.\n\nIn July 2012 snow and ice melted from 97 per cent of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet surface, an event not been seen before during the 33-year satellite record, according to data from the NSIDC. This spring, a record-breaking 80 billion tons of Greenland ice melted.\n\nIce slabs were first discovered in 2012. Scientists have monitored them by driving snowmobiles across southwest Greenland with radars to measure their size.\n\nUnderstanding Arctic feedbacks like this is crucial to understanding how a warming climate will change vulnerable cities.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, decades ago scientists hypothesised what meltwater in a warming climate could do to Greenland\u2019s snow layers, based on measurements and theory,\u201d said Horst Machguth, a researcher at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, and second author on the paper. \u201cOur results show that their hypotheses were close to what is playing out in Greenland today.\u201d\n\nThe amount of emissions released from human activity will determine how much these slabs contribute to sea level rise \u2013 it could be anything from a couple of millimetres to a few inches.\n\n\u201cHumans have a choice about which way this goes,\u201d Dr MacFerrin said.", "description": "Thick, impenetrable \u201cice slabs\u201d are expanding on the inside of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet and\u00a0causing vast amounts of meltwater to spill into the ocean, scientists have discovered.\u00a0 Normally the ice is porous which means it is able to reabsorb meltwater.\u00a0But new research has revealed that the ice slabs are expanding as the climate warms.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/20/greenland-ice-glacier.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
