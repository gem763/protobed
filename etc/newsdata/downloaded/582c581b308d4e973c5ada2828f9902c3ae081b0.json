But the jogger thought, \"they were a couple 'making out' and jogged on,\" according to documents.\n\nJust after 9 a.m., two 12-year-old boys saw a man emerge from the bushy hillside near the school; after the man walked away, the boys looked by the hillside and saw the teen's body, dressed in a drill team uniform, documents said.\n\nWhile semen was discovered on the teen's clothes at the crime scene, and the DNA profile was searched regularly in state and national DNA databases, no match was made for decades, according to documents.\n\nPHOTO: A memorial plaque is shown Jan. 12, 2012, in front of Federal Way High School in Federal Way, Wash., to honor the memory of Sarah Yarborough, who was a student at the school when she was killed in 1991 at the age of 16.

He had served time in prison for an attempted rape from 1983, but his DNA was never entered into CODIS, according to the court documents.\n\nPHOTO: Patrick Leon Nicholas, seen in a 1993 booking photo, has been identified as a suspect in the 1991 cold-case murder of Sarah Yarborough, a Federal Way, Washington high school student.

The teen was excited for college, with big hopes and dreams for her future, her mother said.", "description": "Patrick Nicholas, now 55, is accused of killing Sarah Yarborough on Dec. 14, 1991, when she arrived at her high school in Federal Way, just outside of Tacoma, on an early Saturday morning to meet her drill team, King County Sheriff Mitzi Johanknecht said.
