The price ceilings range from $700.000 in major New South Wales cities to just $250,000 in regional South Australia.\n\nEligible buyers must also make below $125,000 if buying as an individual, or $200,000 as a couple.\n\nThe government has revealed new limits on its first home loan deposit scheme, announcing it will exclude properties that exceed certain price thresholds and be subject to income testing.\n\nUnder the scheme which will begin on 1 January, 10,000 first home buyers will be able to buy a home with a 5% deposit, with the government lending them the remaining 15%.\n\n\u201cApplicants will be subject to eligibility criteria, including having taxable incomes up to $125,000 per annum for singles and up to $200,000 per annum for couples. The Scheme will apply to owner-occupied loans on a principal and interest basis,\u201d Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Housing Minister Michael Sukkar said in a joint release on Monday.\n\nUnder the new draft rules, the scheme will also be constrained by property prices, with capital cities and regional centres \u2013 determined to have populations over 250,000 \u2013 incurring a high threshold.\n\nIn New South Wales, homes over $700,000 in Sydney, Wollongong and the Illawarra area, Newcastle and Lake Macquarie will be excluded. The rest of the state will be subject to a $450,000 limit.\n\nIn Victoria, buyers in Melbourne and Geelong will need to buy properties under $600,000 to be eligible for the scheme. Elsewhere in the state, homes must be under $375,000.\n\nHomebuyers in Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast will need to find a place under $475,000, and Queenslanders outside of those cities will be restricted to $400,000.\n\nPerth and Adelaide and Hobart homes will need to go for under $400,000, while buyers in the ACT and the Northern Territory will be limited to purchases under $500,000 and $375,000 respectively.\n\nPrice restrictions on the first home buyer scheme (Source: Treasury)\n\nThe new thresholds come as prices in major markets rebound. In Sydney and Melbourne, 70% or more of homes at auction have been selling since mid-July with few exceptions, according to Domain.\n\nAs demand has returned to the market, prices have begun to take off once again. In the September quarter alone, Sydney and Melbourne prices lifted around 3.5% apiece, while nationally prices moved 1.7% north, according to property researcher CoreLogic. The ACT jumped 1.4% over the same period, and Brisbane managed 0.5% price growth.\n\nCompare those to the median prices in each capital city as reported by Domain.\n\nMedian home prices in Australia, according to Domain.\n\nLooking at houses first, there\u2019s not a capital city that falls below the government\u2019s threshold. Of those, Brisbane\u2019s median price is the closest at around 16% higher. Units are obviously closer to the money, with every median price falling below the first home buyer scheme\u2019s ceiling. Hobart only just scrapes in, however, by less than $5,000 or around 1%.\n\nFrydenberg and Sukkar claim the scheme will \u201creduce pressure on housing affordability\u201d, and will work in conjunction with another restricted initiative, the Super Scheme which allows Australians build their home deposit within their super fund.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear however whether the government will adjust those thresholds if market prices continue to move. If prices continue to grow at the current click in Sydney and Melbourne for example, the restrictions risk quickly becoming irrelevant altogether.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
