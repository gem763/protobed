Some of those inside weren't aware of the fire, according to the MCTS.\n\nBrown heard the voices of other children who were still inside and attempted to charge into the burning building, even taking a resident's fire extinguisher to help quell the blaze.\n\nFirefighters arrived moments later and doused the fire before anyone was hurt, the MCTS said.\n\nBrown's heroism was honored Thursday when she was named \"Honorary Chief\" as part of Milwaukee's Fire Prevention Week.\n\nShe also received a Community Hero Award during the Milwaukee Fire Department's annual Meritorious Service Awards ceremony.\n\nWOMAN DISGUISES HERSELF AS BUSH TO PHOTOGRAPH SISTER'S ENGAGEMENT\n\n\u201cThe Milwaukee Fire Department is proud of the actions and quick thinking of Chanaye Brown, resulting in a minimal fire instead of what most likely would have been a full-fledged structure fire,\u201d said Lt. Michael Ball, the department's community relations director.\n\n\u201cBecause of her actions in calling the fire department first, alerting residents, and attempting to help extinguish the fire, not only was no one hurt, minimal damage occurred to the building \u2014 allowing the rest of the residents to return to their apartments rather than be displaced,\" Ball said. \"We commend Chanaye for her quick and decisive action in stepping up and helping when the situation arose.\u201d\n\nThe local hero was reportedly seen going door-to-door after the incident to make sure those inside had working smoke detectors in their homes, according to FOX6 News.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"I guess I just felt like it was something that I needed to do, because I have kids of my own and if it was mine, I would want somebody to do it for them, too,\" Brown told the TV station.", "description": "A Milwaukee County Transit System bus driver is being honored for her selfless actions after she helped to save local residents from a burning apartment earlier this year.", "authors": ["David Aaro", "David Aaro Is A Freelance Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Chanaye-Brown-3-FOX6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
