In 2017, Law and Justice government revamped rules for disciplining judges | Janek Skarzynski/AFP via Getty Images EU court top lawyer sides with Poland on judicial independence Non-binding opinion on questions from judges finds the danger of undermining their independence \u2018remains hypothetical.\u2019\n\nQuestions from two Polish courts to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) over whether a new system of disciplining judges in the country violates EU law shouldn\u2019t be admitted, the court's advocate general said Tuesday in a non-binding opinion.\n\nPolish judges had expressed concern that if they rule against Polish government institutions in criminal or administrative proceedings, they might face disciplinary action.\n\nIn 2017, the right-wing Law and Justice government revamped rules for disciplining judges, bringing the system under tight political control. The judges asked the EU's highest court if those new disciplinary rules are in line with EU law.\n\nIf the CJEU finds that the new disciplinary system breaches EU rules, the Polish government would have to drop it.\n\nBut in today\u2019s opinion, the court\u2019s advocate general, Evgeni Tanchev, said that due to procedural reasons, these questions shouldn\u2019t be addressed by the court. He said there hasn\u2019t been \u201csufficient explanation of the relationship between the relevant provisions of EU law and the Polish measures in question,\u201d and \u201cthe question whether there is a structural breach of judicial independence \u2026 remains hypothetical in the circumstances of the main proceedings.\u201d\n\nThat reasoning followed the line of argument taken by the Polish government during a hearing in June.\n\nThe opinion is non-binding but usually constitutes the base for the final judgement, which is expected by the end of this year.\n\nThe Luxembourg court will have another chance to decide whether Poland\u2019s new disciplinary model is in line with EU law. In April, the European Commission started another infringement procedure against Warsaw, saying the new system \u201cundermines the judicial independence of Polish judges and does not ensure the necessary guarantees to protect judges from political control.\u201d", "description": "Non-binding opinion on questions from judges finds the danger of undermining their independence \u2018remains hypothetical.\u2019", "authors": ["Zosia Wanat", "Lili Bayer", "Isabella Borshoff"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-990779564-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
