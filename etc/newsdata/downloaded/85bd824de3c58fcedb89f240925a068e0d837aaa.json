Its so-called Autumn Uprising has led to more than 1,600 arrests, and provoked some very angry commuters. People from Greta Thunberg to Stanley Johnson, the British prime minister\u2019s dad, have lent their support.\n\nOf course there\u2019s official criticism too. Andrea Leadsom, the Brexiter business minister in Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet, says Extinction Rebellion is on the wrong streets in the wrong country. Writing in London\u2019s Evening Standard newspaper, she claimed the U.K. has a long and proud record of global leadership on the climate, \u201cas anyone who has looked up the facts will know.\u201d\n\nWhile Leadsom may be right that there are worse offenders out there, and that Britain has taken meaningful steps to clean up its climate act, there\u2019s a worrying whiff of complacency here. As for those facts of which Leadsom is so fond, they don\u2019t all cast the U.K. in a glowing light.\n\nThis year the U.K. become the first major economy to legislate a commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It has also made great strides in the past few decades in slashing carbon emissions \u2014 by 42% since 1990.\n\nThese are welcome developments, but the future is starting to look a little dim. The government\u2019s own projections have the U.K. missing its 2023 and 2028 carbon budgets (the name for its emissions targets) by quite a margin, as the chart below shows. These targets weren\u2019t even aimed at getting to net-zero emissions by 2050 (the U.K. only had an 80% reduction in mind when they were set), so that hardly bodes well.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Committee on Climate Change, set up to monitor the country\u2019s progress on emissions, also provides a riposte to Leadsom. Since June 2018 her government has delivered only one of the 25 critical policies needed to get emissions reductions back on track, and 10 of those haven\u2019t even been started. Hardly a government responding to a climate emergency.\n\nIn fairness, impressive progress has been made in one critical area: energy (essentially electricity generation) and heating. After a speedy phasing out of coal and take-up of renewables, the sector\u2019s emissions drop will slow to a taper. If the U.K. is going to reach net-zero, action is needed elsewhere, and soon.\n\nTransport, for example, is now the biggest emissions sinner in the U.K. Yet four out of five targets used by the CCC to track the sector\u2019s progress weren\u2019t met, including new car CO2 emissions, electric car registrations and biofuel uptake.\n\nWhile this stalling on climate action is no doubt a symptom of a government distracted by Brexit, that\u2019s no excuse. The U.K. is hosting the UN climate summit next year and if it\u2019s serious about being a leader on the environment, it needs to make a success of it. Overshooting legally-binding carbon budgets doesn\u2019t set a great example.\n\nYou may not agree with their tactics, but it\u2019s hard to argue that Extinction Rebellion should be rabble-rousing somewhere else.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Lara Williams at lwilliams218@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- London\u2019s Extinction Rebellion, the undeniably effective local offshoot of the global environmental protest group,\u00a0has been out in force again this week, shutting down streets in the financial district and disrupting flights from City Airport.\u00a0Its so-called Autumn Uprising has led", "authors": ["Lara Williams"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e5DLGuCSZ701..RTcVabew--~B/aD04NTg7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/0f8c2a9b01ed3ad3a929b9bf6cd5c98f", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
