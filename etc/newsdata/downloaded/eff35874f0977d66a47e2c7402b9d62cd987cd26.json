(Julien Warnand/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nEuropean leaders on Monday said they were facing a direct security peril from Turkey\u2019s assault on Kurdish positions in Syria, as France scrambled to protect its troops inside the country, Belgium warned that it could face terrorist attacks and E.U. foreign ministers voiced frustrations with Washington.\n\nThe situation in Syria was turning into a security vortex for European countries that have long played a supporting role for U.S. troops in combat with the Islamic State. President Trump decided late Saturday to pull all U.S. troops from the country within weeks, leaving allies struggling to respond. Many E.U. citizens who joined the Islamic State have also been sitting in Kurdish-controlled prison camps in northeast Syria, raising questions about whether they could return covertly to Europe to carry out strikes after several years of relative quiet.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have magic powers\u201d to stop the Turkish assault, said Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell, who is designated to become the E.U. foreign policy chief later this year. \u201cIf the American troops wouldn\u2019t have withdrawn this attack would have been impossible. The American troop withdrawal was a condition in order to make the attack possible.\u201d\n\n[European leaders criticize Turkish offensive in Syria as U.S. accelerates pullout]\n\nEuropean foreign ministers were meeting Monday in Luxembourg to discuss a possible E.U.-wide arms embargo against Turkey in response to the incursion. Already, several of the main European arms producers, including France and Germany, have blocked sales to Ankara.\n\nBut some countries were facing a more direct military peril. British and French special forces have supported U.S. troops in Syria for years. French President Emmanuel Macron early Monday ordered that measures be taken \u201cin the coming hours to ensure the security of French military and civilian personnel present in the zone.\u201d\n\nAlthough Macron\u2019s office did not specify whether French troops would pull out entirely, French officials said over the summer that a full U.S. withdrawal would likely require France to depart as well.\n\nMacron also said security was also being tightened on French soil because of the escape of some Islamic State prisoners from the Syrian prison camps.\n\n\n\nSmoke rises from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, in a picture taken from the Turkish side of the border in Ceylanpinar on Oct. 11, 2019, on the third day of Turkey's military operation against Kurdish forces.

But the frustrations were clear on Monday, with Europeans facing security risks from a situation they felt unable to put an end to on the ground.\n\n\u201cAs Europeans, it must be said, we are not in a position to stop this,\u201d said Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn, who said he wanted an arms blockade against Turkey instead.\n\nSome leaders said that the situation was an indication that Europe needed to become militarily independent from the United States, since they said they cannot rely on Washington to defend its interests.\n\n\u201cIt is time that the European Union \u2026 becomes as military independent as possible, because one sees clearly in this situation that one cannot count on the wider world,\u201d French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire told the FranceInfo broadcaster on Monday.\n\nAnd in Belgium, the country\u2019s chief prosecutor warned Monday that Belgian citizens who had been in the Kurdish-controlled prison camps for Islamic State sympathizers could return home and carry out attacks. He said that he preferred repatriating Belgian citizens in a controlled manner so that they could face Belgian courts, although it is no longer clear whether that is possible.\n\nThe situation in Syria is \u201cout of control,\u201d Belgian Federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw told Belgium\u2019s RTBF broadcaster on Monday. He said that terrorist attacks on Belgian soil in recent years \u201cwere committed by people who returned clandestinely.\u201d\n\nQuentin Aries contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nAs Trump withdraws U.S. forces from northern Syria, his administration scrambles to respond\n\nU.
