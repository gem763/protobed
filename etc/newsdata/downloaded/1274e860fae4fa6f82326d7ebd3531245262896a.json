We want to be able to bury her and to mourn her.\n\n'She was just looking for a better life and we are still struggling to understand how this has happened.'\n\nAs Bui spoke the teen's mother lay prone on the bed at the family home too grief stricken to speak or move.\n\nRelatives gathered in the courtyard of the house in the village of Yen Thanh in Nghe An Province, abut 170 miles from the country's capital Hanoi.\n\nThey sat smoking and drinking tea as a procession of visitors called to pay their respects at a makeshift shrine bearing a photo of Anna.\n\nAs Bui spoke the teen's mother (pictured) lay prone on the bed at the family home too grief stricken to speak or move\n\nThe victims were thought to have been carrying false Chinese passports having begun their perilous journey to the UK from China\n\nAnna's sister said: 'We are praying for a miracle that Anna is still alive, but we do not have much hope'\n\nLess than half a mile away in the same village another family had erected a shrine to former soldier Nguyen Dinh Tu.\n\nFamily members revealed that they are certain he was among those who died as he was due to meet with to relatives \u2013 both living in the UK illegally \u2013 and failed to show up.\n\nHis brother Nguyen Van Tinh said they had made contact with the relatives but admitted as they were living in the UK illegally they had been too afraid to contact police investigating the deaths.\n\nAnna Bui Thi Nhung's family and relatives, seen at the family house in Yen Thanh district\n\nAnna's elder sister Bui Thi Loan (right) said they wanted her body repatriated so she could be buried in the village that she had left in search of a better life\n\nVan Tinh handed MailOnline a photograph of his brother which he requested be sent to Essex Police to help in any identification.\n\nThe photograph shows Dinh Tu sitting on a park bench with his right arm covered with tattoos.\n\nMailOnline has emailed the photograph to Essex Police as well as supplying contact details for the family.\n\nWhile more than half a dozen names of potential victims have been revealed authorities in Vietnam have not made contact with the families to request with identification.\n\nThe victims were thought to have been carrying false Chinese passports having begun their perilous journey to the UK from China.\n\nVan Tinh handed MailOnline a photograph of his brother which he requested be sent to Essex Police to help in any identification\n\nBrother Nguyen Van Tinh admitted that as they were living in the UK illegally they had been too afraid to contact police investigating the deaths\n\nClose family members said Dinh Tu, who has a young son, was an acquaintance of Anna who had hoped to work as nail technician after arriving in the UK.\n\n'He did know her as this is such a small place, but they were not that close friends. He would have recognised her when they met up' said a family friend.\n\nFamily members named a third victim from the same village as former policeman Le Van Ha.\n\nThis has led to Yen Thanh being called ' The Village of the Dammed' as others among the 39 victims are thought to have originated from the same area where poverty is rife and jobs scarce.\n\nAll three victims had left Yen Thanh some months ago in the hope of finding work in the UK and sending money home to support extended families.\n\nAnna's family sat smoking and drinking tea as a procession of visitors called to pay their respects at a makeshift shrine\n\nAs is the custom a small shrine bearing fruit and flowers surrounding a photograph of Dinh Yu had been set up in a front room of the house\n\nAnna, who left school at 15 with no qualifications, had told family and friends she travelled to China and Germany before reportedly climbing into the ill-fated refrigerated container that ended up in Essex.\n\nHer cousin 30 year old Tran Dinh Luc said she had been a 'happy kind girl' who wanted to make a new life and help support her family after the death of her father two years ago.\n\n'We all miss her terribly but are holding out for a miracle that she did not get in the lorry.\n\n'We want to have her back home.

It is so cruel.'\n\nThe family have been following developments on their smart phones and were aware that the driver of the lorry had been charged with 39 counts on manslaughter.\n\nWho has been arrested so far? As police in the UK continue their investigations into the 39 migrants who lost their lives trying to enter the country, we keep track of who has been arrested so far. Lorry driver Maurice Mo Robinson: Arrested on suspicion of murder, police also given extra time to quiz the 25-year-old. Mo Robinson is the truck driver arrested after 39 people were found dead in the back of a lorry he was driving Joanna Maher, 38, and her husband Thomas, also 38: The Warrington couple who previously told MailOnline they had sold the container are understood to have been held on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter. Mrs Maher, a mother-of-three, pictured with her trucker boss husband Thomas, told MailOnline that she sold the lorry involved in the deaths of 39 migrants to an Irish haulage firm 13 months ago 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland: The latest arrest took place at Stansted Airport.

That is why he tried to get to the UK,' he said.\n\nNguyen Van Tinh said his brother's widow Hoang Thi Thuong was so devastated that she had been admitted to hospital.\n\n'She is not very well,' he said. 'This has hurt the family.'\n\nVan Tinh confirmed that his brother was due to be met on his arrival in the UK by two other relatives who were going to help him find work.\n\nHe said both men were working illegally and had been smuggled into the country.\n\n'They are too afraid to come forward and say anything,' said Van Tinh whose eyes were red rimmed from weeping.\n\nAs is the custom a small shrine bearing fruit and flowers surrounding a photograph of Dinh Yu had been set up in a front room of the house.\n\nVisitors were asked to light an incense stick and place it by the photo, which under a Vietnamese tradition is meant to help guide a soul home.\n\nThe driver of the refrigerated trailer has been charged with 39 counts of manslaughter and people trafficking.\n\nThe 31 men and eight women were initially believed to be Chinese, but several Vietnamese families have now come forward with fears their relatives are among the dead.\n\nMany are believed to have come from impoverished villages in central Vietnam, where some families now fear the worst.\n\nLe Minh Tuan has not heard from his son Le Van Ha since a message over Facebook around a week ago saying 'I'm about to board a car to Britain. I will contact the family when I arrive in England, Dad.'\n\nThat was two days before the refrigerated trailer stuffed with bodies was discovered in Essex, east of London.\n\n'We've heard no news from him since,' Tuan told AFP, his eyes red from crying.\n\nLe Minh Tuan (pictured) has not heard from his son Le Van Ha since a message over Facebook around a week ago\n\n'For sure he was in that lorry.

Many end up working in Britain illegally in nail bars or on cannabis farms, heavily indebted and subject to exploitation.\n\nFive people have so far been arrested in Britain in connection with the tragedy, the country's largest murder probe since the 2005 London suicide bombings.\n\nNearby, the mother of missing 28-year-old man Vo Ngoc Nam (pictured) said she had not yet heard anything on the fate of her son\n\nEssex police say they want to fast-track the process of fingerprint identification and DNA testing, but said it would take time.\n\nVietnam media reported that authorities had been contacted by 12 families fearing their loved ones were among the victims.\n\nThe dozen included families from Yen Thanh and Ha Tinh.\n\nEssex Police expect full identification of all the victims to take several weeks.\n\nThe Vietnamese Embassy in London has started a hotline while the ambassador to the UK, Tran Ngoc An, spoke to Home Secretary Priti Patel on Friday night before meeting investigators from the National Crime Agency and Essex Police.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Martin Pasmore told reporters on Saturday the ambassador had visited the civic centre in Grays to pay tribute to the victims.\n\nHe said there were 'very, very few' identity documents recovered and that police will share fingerprints with Vietnamese authorities in a bid to identify the bodies.\n\nInvestigators will also look at tattoos, scars and belongings, including jewellery and clothing, with each of the victims said to have had some kind of bag.\n\nMore than 500 exhibits have been collected, including mobile phones, which will be downloaded and interrogated for any messages that could give clues to the identity of the victims or how they came to be in the back of the trailer.\n\nThree other people arrested over the deaths remain in custody, while a man wanted in connection with the investigation was arrested at Dublin port on Saturday.\n\nGardai said the man, who is in his early 20s and from Northern Ireland, was held over an unrelated outstanding court order.\n\nPham Tra My, 26, has not been in contact with her family since sending a final text message home on Tuesday saying she could not breathe\n\nHe is understood to be sought by Essex Police as part of their probe, and the force confirmed officers are in touch with Irish police.\n\nA 48-year-old man, from Northern Ireland, was detained at Stansted Airport on Friday on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and manslaughter.\n\nOfficers had earlier arrested a couple named locally as haulage boss Thomas Maher and his wife Joanna, both 38, in Warrington, where they have a four-bedroom home.\n\nThe pair, originally from southern Ireland, were held on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter and people trafficking.\n\nIn Belgium, police are hunting the driver who delivered the trailer to Zeebrugge, the port it left before arriving in the UK.\n\nIt is not yet known when the victims entered the trailer, where temperatures can be as low as minus 25C if the fridge is activated, or the exact route it travelled.\n\nBelgian officials said the trailer arrived at Zeebrugge at 2.49pm on Tuesday and left the port the same day en route to Purfleet.\n\nThe trailer arrived at Purfleet at around 12.30am on Wednesday, and was picked up by the cab, known as the tractor, which arrived from Northern Ireland via Holyhead in North Wales on Sunday.\n\nThe lorry left the port at Purfleet shortly after 1.05am before police were called to the Waterglade Industrial Park on Eastern Avenue in Grays at 1.40am.\n\nThe family of one of the young Vietnamese women thought to be among the 39 dead said she dismissed their pleas not to travel.\n\nPham Tra My, 26, has not been in contact with her family since sending a final text message home on Tuesday saying she could not breathe.\n\nThe lorry driver, 25-year-old Maurice 'Mo' Robinson, from Northern Ireland, is due to appear in court on Monday charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering.\n\nRelatives of Ms Tra My told the BBC they have not been able to contact her since she sent a text on Tuesday night saying she was suffocating.\n\n'I am really, really sorry, Mum and Dad, my trip to a foreign land has failed,' she wrote.\n\n'I am dying, I can't breathe. I love you very much Mum and Dad. I am sorry, Mother.'\n\nMs Tra My is reported to have paid a charge of about \u00a330,000 to people smugglers in order to be brought into the UK illegally.\n\nAnna Tran Thi Giao, grandmother of Vietnamese Joseph Nguyen Dinh Luong who is one of the suspected victims of the 39 people found dead in a refrigerated truck in Britain, reacts at her home in Ha Tinh province\n\nHer father, Pham Van Thin, told Sky News: 'We tried to talk her out of it because it would be a very difficult journey for her as a girl.\n\n'But she said: 'If I don't go, the family would stay in a very difficult situation because of the big debt'.\n\n'So she took a risk and decided to go, and we had to agree.'\n\nHe added: 'We all have been in shock. I cannot explain our pain and devastating feeling. We were all very devastated and sad.'\n\nHe told CNN that smugglers said the crossing was 'a safe route' and that people would go by aeroplane or car.\n\n'If I had known she would go by this route, I would not have let her go,' the father said.\n\nAll of the victims have since been moved from the vehicle in Tilbury Docks to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford for post-mortem examinations to be carried out.\n\nEssex Police are now working on the largest mass fatality victim identification process in its history, having previously said all were from China.\n\nInvestigators will look at tattoos, scars and belongings, including jewellery and clothing, with each of the victims said to have had some kind of bag.\n\nMore than 500 exhibits have been collected, including mobile phones, which will be downloaded and interrogated for any messages that could give clues to the identity of the victims or how they came to be in the back of the trailer.\n\nDetectives are investigating a 'wider conspiracy' after claims surfaced that the lorry could have been part of a convoy of three carrying around 100 people.\n\nThe mother and a sister of 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung set up an altar in the village of Yen Thanh in north-central Vietnam after a family friend in the UK told them she had died after paying thousands of pounds in the hope of finding work in a nail bar.\n\nAnother Vietnamese father, Nguyen Dinh Gia, fears his 20-year-old son, Nguyen Dinh Luong, was among the victims.\n\nThe Vietnamese Embassy in London has started a hotline while the ambassador to the UK, Tran Ngoc An, spoke to Home Secretary Priti Patel on Friday night before meeting investigators from the National Crime Agency and Essex Police.\n\nLorry driver Robinson is expected to appear before magistrates in Chelmsford on Monday.\n\nThree other people arrested over the deaths remain in custody while a man wanted in connection with the investigation was arrested at Dublin port on Saturday. In Belgium, police are hunting the driver who delivered the trailer to Zeebrugge, the port it left before arriving in the UK.\n\nIt is not yet known when the victims entered the trailer, where temperatures can be as low as minus 25C (minus 13F) if the fridge is activated, or the exact route it travelled.\n\nShadow home secretary Diane Abbott said greater international co-operation is needed to prevent similar events happening again.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, she added: 'You cannot stop international people tracking gangs, if people trafficking is what this is, you can't stop them without working internationally.\n\n'Yes, we can try and make our east coast ports more secure, but you have to have more international co-operation.'\n\nDreams of a better life: Faces of the migrants who died in truck tragedy while trying to enter UK - as it emerges 25 of the 39 victims were from the same Vietnamese village\n\nHoping for a better life, here are the faces of the 39 people who are believed to have frozen to death in the back of a truck after a desperate attempt to reach Britain.\n\nThe victims were discovered naked, or with minimal clothing, and had been desperately 'banging on the doors' for help and had 'foam coming from their mouths'.\n\nThe bodies of eight women and 31 men could have been frozen in the truck for several days when they were discovered on Wednesday in Grays, Essex, after the container criss-crossed the Channel via refugee hotspots.\n\nIt is now thought that as many as 25 of the 39 victims are Vietnamese and from the same impoverished coastal region of Yen Than.\n\nRelatives said several were going to work in nail salons.\n\nRelatives of victims are said to have received visits from gangs offering them refunds for the failed journeys, The Sun reports.\n\nVietHome, a British organisation which tries to help UK-based Vietnamese residents, said it had been sent 20 photographs and names of people feared to have been inside the lorry container.\n\nSeven suspected victims have so far come to light, Anna Bui Thi Nhung, Pham Thi Tra My, Nguyen Dinh Luong, Nguyen Dinh Tu, Vo Ngoc Nam and cousins Hung Nguyen and Hoang Van Tiep.\n\nAll 39 people have been moved from Tilbury Docks to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford and are being formally identified.\n\nAnna Bui Thi Nhung, 19, from Vietnam paid an agent over $10,000 with the hope of entering the U.K.\n\nAn aspiring nail technician who paid almost \u00a38,800 in a desperate attempt to make it to Britain\n\nAnna Bui Thi Nhung, 19, from Vietnam paid an agent over $10,000 with the hope of entering the U.K. to work as a nail technician, according to a relative.\n\nHer mother and a sister today cried as they set up an altar with incense and a photo of the suspected victim where family and friends can pray at their home in Do Thanh village.\n\nThe family heard from a friend living in the UK that 'Nhung is one of the victims,' said one of her relatives, who was visiting the missing teen's mother.\n\nNhung and many others from Yen Thanh district, where the village is located, some 200 kilometers (120 miles) south of Hanoi, travel abroad looking to make the type of money they cannot earn back home. One of their main goals is to send back enough to allow their families to build large homes that they would otherwise be unable to afford.\n\nOn October 21, days before her family lost contact with her and the news of the doomed shipping container emerged, Nhung wrote in a Facebook post: 'Being grown up means having to hide your sadness in the dark, and keeping a smile on your face.'\n\nA relative looks at an image of Nhung. The 19-year-old wanted to work as a nail technician, according to a relative\n\nNhung's family said she first left Nhung on her journey overseas in August. She went to China first, before eventually making her way to Germany, then Belgium, where they believe she boarded the fated truck.\n\n'I just want a peaceful life,' Nhung wrote in a caption beneath a photo of her smiling in a green field a few weeks after leaving Vietnam.\n\nLate on Saturday night, Nhung's family, devoid of hope, set up an altar in her memory, with her photo next to her father's.\n\nHer father died of cancer a few years ago. Her mother was unable to work because of health complications and so her loved ones clubbed together to finance a new life overseas, Nhung's family said.\n\nThe missing woman's relatives wait for news about her at her home in Ngh\u1ec7 An Province, Vietnam\n\n'Nhung didn't have the qualifications to get a good job with handsome pay. Nor do her friends and many others here,' said Nhung's uncle, Hoang Binh.\n\n'Going abroad and sending back money was the only choice,' he added.\n\nBy early September, it was not clear where she was, but Nhung was already well into her trip, and reflecting on her next steps.\n\nBeside a stock image of two children flying kites at sunset, she posted: 'As I grow up, I see that life is not as peaceful as I used to think. When I grow up, I want to go back to my childhood, when I lived freely'.\n\nAnna Tran Thi Hien, mother of suspected victim Nhung, sits on a bed at her home\n\nTon Quang Tuan, one of Nhung's friends living in Berlin, said that 'We went out a few times when Nhung was in Berlin' and added that 'she was in a good mood, very happy,' but they lost contact after she said she had to leave for Britain.\n\nIt was not clear how Nhung had travelled from the Vietnamese countryside to China and then Berlin, but the German capital has emerged in recent years as a staging ground for Vietnamese and other migrants looking to start new lives in Britain.\n\n'I feel lonely in the place I used to dream of everyday,' Nhung wrote on September 25.\n\nIt was unclear where she was - Vietnamese smugglers are said to advise their subjects to live discreetly and not to give away too many clues in order to evade detection from the authorities.\n\nThe family heard from a friend living in the UK that 'Nhung is one of the victims,' said one of Nhung's relatives, who was visiting the missing teen's despaired mother. Pictured: The family wait for news about Nhung\n\nA few days later, Nhung was pictured outside Berlin Cathedral with a cup of bubble tea in her hands.\n\nBy late October, Nhung was in Belgium. She posted photos of herself, again with a cup of bubble tea in her hand, excitedly exploring the sights of Brussels, including the old stock exchange and the bustling Rue Auguste Orts thoroughfare.\n\nIt was from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge that the doomed container eventually departed. Her family believe that she was on board.\n\nIn Berlin, Nhung wrote: 'Back in Vietnam, I thought Europe was pink. But it turns out it's black'.\n\n\n\n'Sorry mum, I can't breathe': The harrowing messages sent from inside the lorry by a victim who only wanted 'a better life'\n\nSuspected victim Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her mother a series of harrowing messages telling her she 'loved her' and was 'dying because she couldn't breathe' in the moments before her death, her family have claimed\n\nSuspected victim Pham Thi Tra My, 26, from Vietnam sent her mother a series of harrowing messages telling her she 'loved her' and was 'dying because she couldn't breathe' in the moments before her death, her family have claimed.\n\nThey claim to have paid people smugglers \u00a330,000 for their daughter to travel to the UK via China 'in search of a better life'.\n\nShe is from Ha Tinh, an impoverished province in a part of Vietnam where many of the country's illegal migrants come from.\n\nNguyen Thi Phong and Pham Van Thin, told CNN it was 'very painful' to receive the text - saying she must have known she was going to die when she sent it.\n\n'I've lost both my loved one and my money,' her father Pham said, claiming he and his partner scraped together the money to pay for their daughter to travel to the UK.\n\nThe pair, who make around $400 a month between them, said the smugglers did not tell them how their daughter would be transported to the UK.\n\n'The smugglers said that this was a ... safe route, that people would go by airplane, car ... if I had known she would go by this route, I would not have let her go,' Pham added.\n\nA human rights worker in Vietnam, who has spoken with Tra My's family, revealed she made the perilous journey because her family was in debt and she was desperately trying to help them.\n\nHer family claim to have paid people smugglers \u00a330,000 for their daughter to travel to the UK via China 'in search of a better life'\n\n'She had just returned from Japan where she was working to try and pay off the debt. And that was not enough and so she looked for a better future,' she told the BBC.\n\nAsking to remain anonymous, the human rights worker continued: 'For this girl it is very sad that she took the risk because she was dealing with debt that was created by another man in the family.\n\n'And I also learnt that the service that she was using was called 'very important service' and so it is like a business class ticket on the lorry and with that she had to pay double or three times the price of the cheap ticket.'\n\nIn text messages sent at 10.28pm GMT on Tuesday, Pham Thi Tra told her mother, 'I love you so much...I'm sorry.' Pictured, The screenshot of Tra My's last text\n\nThe human rights worker added that migrants are told they can vast amounts of money by moving to the UK, and the 26-year-old may have been convinced to purchase a 'VIP ticket' to get there.\n\nHe family mortgaged the house to get that money for her, the human rights worked added.\n\nPham Thi Tra's last text messages were sent at 10.28pm BST on Tuesday - two hours before the truck reached the UK, as it was en route from Belgium.\n\nShe told her mother: 'I'm sorry Mum.

I'm dying because I can't breathe.'\n\nTra My's brother told the BBC on Friday that his sister had told them not to contact her because 'the organisers' did not allow her to receive calls.\n\nHe said she flew to China from her home in Can L\u1ed9c, a rural district of H\u00e0 T\u0129nh Province in Vietnam, then left for France and initially attempted to cross the border into the UK on October 19, but 'got caught' and turned back.\n\nPham Van Thin (right) and Nguyen Thi Phong (left), father and mother of Tra My.
