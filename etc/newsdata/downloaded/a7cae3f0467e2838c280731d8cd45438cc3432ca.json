She said she was sorry for paying to get her daughter answers on her standardized tests. Not Lori Loughlin. The \"Fuller House\" star, accused of shelling out hundreds of thousands of dollars to get her daughters enrolled at the University of Southern California, rejected a plea deal and is determined to avoid prison time.\n\nLoughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, arrived in Boston court for the first time in months on Tuesday, following their indictment in the college cheating scandal. They officially waived their rights to separate lawyers from the same law firm.\n\nNEW: Actress Lori Loughlin and husband Mossimo Giannulli avoid crowds and enter Boston's federal courthouse through the back door. The pair are two, of the 27, ensnared in the college admissions scandal, still fighting the charges.\n\nLIVE coverage w/ @Lisa_Gresci on @wbz at 5PM. pic.twitter.com/iFO4GRKswc \u2014 Anaridis Rodriguez (@Anaridis) August 27, 2019\n\n#BREAKING: #LoriLoughlin just entered Federal Court ahead of a conflict-of-interest hearing involving her lawyers.\n\n\n\nThis is all part of the #collegeadmissionsscandal. @NBC10Boston pic.twitter.com/tHBdxpUr2h \u2014 Eli Rosenberg NBC10 Boston (@EliNBCBoston) August 27, 2019\n\nLegal experts like James J.
