So, we will be updating this post as impressions come to us. Here\u2019s what we think so far:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2022 The beginning of the campaign underscores the smaller-scale urban fights that typified the \u201cWarfare\u201d series. We only went through two missions this morning, but other early reviews today also note that there are scenes with violence that might make viewers uncomfortable. Indeed, the introductory cinematic ends with a suicide bomber appearing to detonate a vest of explosives next to a woman who pulls her child close to her. Shades of the London bombing scene from Modern Warfare 3.\n\n\u2022 The \u201cleaning\u201d mechanic makes a welcome appearance in the series. Players can now mount their weapons on an object like a desk or door frame and aim without exposing their bodies to incoming fire. Call of Duty has been the source of many memes, including an 2009 comment from Infinity Ward that Modern Warfare 2 was \u201cnot balanced for lean.\u201d\n\n\u2022 For some, like myself, all this attention to slower, more tactical ground warfare is a welcome addition. The last few CoD games pushed a more frenetic pace as the series leaned heavier into science fiction. It rewarded the sweatier, quick-twitch players who had been grinding for the best gear. Now you can do some serious damage even with basic loadouts so long as you\u2019re playing smart.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the last five years, the game has become more of an arcade shooter, but in so doing, it\u2019s become more popular than ever. This turned off some of Call of Duty\u2019s initial player base, and time will tell whether this slower, more tactical Call of Duty will bring back or keep players. If they do ratchet up the speed again, it\u2019d be nice if they made it a separate game mode.\n\n\u2022 The slow-mo does have its downsides at times. Going into iron sights for better aim can feel sluggish. Different guns yield different results, and fans of the twitchy Call of Duty game play will need to adjust to this flow. Sliding and running are also slower. Every player moves like they have weight to them. Visually, looking at other players running seems very strange, like they\u2019re purposefully running in slow motion.\n\n\u2022 The maps feel like there are more hiding places. It\u2019ll probably take more time to learn them, but I found some campers and also found myself camping and scoring points. You can bet this will be a big discussion point on Reddit and elsewhere. If you run around recklessly, you will die. A lot.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2022 The maps for 10 vs. 10 also feel unusually large, and that\u2019s before the 64-player Ground War went live this afternoon. (We\u2019re playing that now). That mode will feature three large maps.\n\n\u2022 Also new (at least we think) is the ability to mute your whole lobby. If someone\u2019s spewing stupid stuff or playing their music really loud while wearing a mic, you don\u2019t have to search through the lobby, ID the offender, click their profile and mute them individually. Now you can just shut up the whole lobby by pressing the right stick.\n\n\u2022 The \u201cGunfight\u201d mode is where this slower game play really shines. Two teams of two are given random guns in a small map for quick, tactical skirmishes. It\u2019s also a great way to try out and get familiar with a variety of guns in quick succession.\n\nAD\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Post staff will update this post as we play more.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "First impressions as Captain Price returns to the field.", "authors": ["Gene Park"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zfChhELfhBErnBImVaGpVpNqMqI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3LPPMCUROJHGXBYO74GGHNLPGI.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
