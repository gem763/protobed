Schiff (D-Calif.) of conducting an unfair investigation.\n\n\u201cThis is a kangaroo court and Chairman Schiff is acting like a malicious Captain Kangaroo,\u201d said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who joined his colleagues in speaking to reporters after Schiff made a statement on Tuesday morning.\n\nRep.

Schiff (D-Calif.) said the decision to block Sondland\u2019s appearance is \u201cstrong evidence\u201d of obstruction of Congress, potentially another article of impeachment against Trump.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Schiff said that the State Department not only blocked Sondland\u2019s appearance but is preventing him from turning over text messages relevant to the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe failure to produce this witness, the failure to produce these documents we consider yet additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress, a coequal branch of government,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe president and secretary of state are taking actions that prevent us from getting the facts needed to protect the nation\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSchiff did not take questions from reporters.\n\n9:25 a.m.: Trump says Sondland would have faced a \u2018kangaroo court\u2019\n\nTrump said blocking Sondland\u2019s appearance was justified because he was scheduled to be deposed by \u201ca totally compromised kangaroo court.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see,\u201d Trump said in a tweet.\n\nAD\n\n9:10 a.m.: State Dept. order to Sondland draws condemnation from Democrats\n\nThe State Department\u2019s move to block Sondland from appearing before congressional committees on Tuesday drew swift condemnation from Democrats.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the obstructionism of the White House that has been taking place since the beginning of the year,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a Judiciary Committee member, said in an interview. \u201cWe have a lawless, runaway executive branch of government, and the president has ordered wholesale defiance of the lawful demands of Congress.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRaskin said that the administration\u2019s actions \u201ccan be reduced to an article of impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a certain sense they are digging their own impeachment pit if they thumb their nose at the people\u2019s representatives,\u201d Raskin said.\n\nAD\n\nRep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) said blocking Sondland amounted to \u201cobstruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cSondland is a key witness to the President\u2019s attempts to seek campaign interference from Ukraine,\u201d he said in a tweet. \u201cThe President is obviously terrified of what Sondland might tell Congress.\u201d\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) said the Trump administration\u2019s move showed \u201cconsciousness of guilt.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn innocent president allows his team to be interviewed. But a guilty one blocks testimony,\u201d Swalwell tweeted.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) planned to address reporters about the issue at 9:30 a.m.\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Mike DeBonis\n\n8:50 a.m.: White House blocks Sondland deposition\n\nThe Trump administration on Tuesday blocked a planned deposition by Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who has emerged as a central figure in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSondland was scheduled to be deposed by lawmakers about his activities as Trump urged Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nText messages made public last week show that Sondland, whose portfolio does not include U.S.-Ukraine relations, inserted himself into the effort to obtain a commitment from Ukraine to launch the investigations. At the time, the government in Kiev was eagerly awaiting the release of nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid and the arrangement of a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nOfficials\u2019 texts reveal belief that Trump wanted probes as condition of Ukraine meeting\n\nIn one text message, Sondland wrote that Trump \u201creally wants the deliverable,\u201d apparently referring to a clear demonstration from Ukraine that it would undertake the investigations.\n\nAD\n\nSondland worked closely with Kurt Volker, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, to shape U.S. foreign policy around Trump\u2019s desire to investigate Hunter Biden, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, as well as an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 presidential election to undermine Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Shane Harris\n\n7:45 a.m.: Murphy seeks to simplify the case for impeachment\n\nWith Republicans laboring to undermine the impeachment inquiry, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) sought to simplify the story line on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMorning all,\u201d Murphy wrote in a morning tweet. \u201c1. The President tried to conspire with a foreign country to destroy his political opponents. 2. He sent out a transcript verifying this. 3. His aide released text messages detailing the conspiracy. 4. This isn\u2019t allowed in a democracy. Have a great day.\u201d\n\n7:15 a.m.: Leading Republicans resurrect May video of Rep. Al Green\n\nLeading Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), have resurrected a video clip of Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.) expressing concerns that Trump will be reelected if he\u2019s not impeached.\n\nIn a tweet on Monday night, McCarthy shared the video from an appearance by Green on MSNBC, quoting him saying, \u201cI\u2019m concerned that if we don\u2019t impeach this president, he will get reelected.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what it looks like when Democrats are being honest,\u201d McCarthy wrote.\n\nMcCarthy made no mention of the fact that the clip was from May, long before the controversy over Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky ignited.\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway also shared the video clip of Green on Twitter on Tuesday morning.\n\nGreen has been an advocate of Trump\u2019s impeachment since 2017.\n\n6 a.m.: In new poll, majority of Americans say they endorse opening of House impeachment inquiry of Trump\n\nA majority of Americans say they endorse the decision by House Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry of Trump, and nearly half of all adults also say the House should take the additional step and recommend that the president be removed from office, according to a poll.\n\nThe findings in the Washington Post-Schar School poll indicate that public opinion has shifted quickly against the president and in favor of impeachment proceedings in recent weeks as information has been released about Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukrainian government officials to undertake an investigation into Biden, a potential 2020 campaign rival, and Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nPower Up: Trump is on shaky ground when it comes to impeachment, our new poll finds\n\nPrevious Post-Schar School or Post-ABC News polls taken at different points throughout this year found majorities of Americans opposing the start of an impeachment proceeding, with 37 percent to 41 percent saying they favored such a step. The recent revelations appear to have prompted many Americans to rethink their position.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Dan Balz and Scott Clement\n\n5 a.m.: Trump continues push for Schiff to be \u2018Impeached!\u2019\n\nAmid a spate of tweets and retweets that continued past midnight, Trump renewed his call for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to be removed from office.\n\nIn one tweet, Trump shared a video of House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) saying he supports a resolution censuring Schiff for his handling of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have seized on an opening statement by Schiff at a hearing in which he provided an embellished version of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. Schiff later said his statement was partly parody and that Trump should have recognized that.\n\n\u201cAdam should be Impeached!\u201d Trump wrote in his tweet.\n\nWhile House members can be expelled from the chamber, they cannot be impeached.", "description": "U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland was ordered not to testify as a newly released Washington Post-Schar School poll finds public opinion has shifted quickly against the president.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rliDbwWyL-lbr1yU4Y_LpymXVao=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KJWPX6XJZII6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
