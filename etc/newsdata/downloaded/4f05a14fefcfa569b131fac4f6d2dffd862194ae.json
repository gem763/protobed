BOJ Tapers So Much That Bond Buying Could Be Less Than Stocks\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is certainly putting his money where his mouth was, after repeated expressions of concern about excessively low bond yields.\n\nTo be precise, he\u2019s putting up less money -- in the regular BOJ bond-purchase operations that have served as a component of the central bank\u2019s stimulus programs since Kuroda took office in 2013. The current buying pace would see the BOJ take just 5 trillion yen ($46 billion) of Japanese governments bonds (JGBs) in 2020, according to calculations by Yuki Masujima at Bloomberg Economics.\n\nThat\u2019s less than the 6 trillion yen annual target for the BOJ\u2019s purchases of equity exchange-traded funds, which have served as a supplemental component of Japan\u2019s stimulus. And it\u2019s just a fraction of the official target of 80 trillion yen that\u2019s been disregarded for some time now.\n\nThe downshift in bond purchases follows the powerful rally in sovereign bonds over the past year, which sent Japan\u2019s 10-year yields below the BOJ\u2019s loose target range of 0.2% to negative 0.2%. In early September, even 20-year yields approached 0%. Ten-year yields were at -0.153% at 2:35 p.m. in Tokyo.\n\nSuper-low long-term yields threatened to be counterproductive to the BOJ\u2019s policies. Kuroda said after last month\u2019s policy meeting that excessively low yields would damage consumer sentiment as returns on pensions and other long-term investments would drop.\n\nThe market is listening: on Tuesday, demand at a government auction for 10-year notes dropped to the lowest level since August 2016. That last time was days after the BOJ had launched a comprehensive review of its policy framework.\n\nAnd that auction in turn sparked the biggest sell-off in Japanese government bond futures in more than three years.\n\nMeantime, ETF purchases offer a steady source of support for Japan\u2019s stocks, which just capped their best month since October 2017 -- the time of global synchronous growth.", "description": "BOJ Tapers So Much That Bond Buying Could Be Less Than Stocks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB5I0NR_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
