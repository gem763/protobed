The storm was then expected to continue towards South Carolina by early Thursday, where Governor Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency on Saturday.\n\nEvacuations began on Saturday in the Bahamas as most resorts closed down and authorities evacuated the northern shore and low-lying islands.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Some of the most reliable computer models suggest the storm will stall and dump as much as 50in (127cm) of rain. He said expect between 2ft and 4ft (0.6 to 1.2 metres) of rain there.\n\nMillions of people in Florida have been in the changing potential path of the hurricane. Forecasters say Dorian, which had top sustained winds of 145 mph on Saturday morning, will hover along Florida\u2019s east coast Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

If it bumps further east, that obviously is positive. If it bumps just a little west, than you\u2019re looking at really, really significant impacts,\u201d Mr DeSantis said at a briefing.\n\nHe added that even if Dorian did not make landfall in Florida, the state could still be affected by a \u201creally significant storm surge\u201d as the cyclone heads north along the East Coast.\n\nMr Trump has declared a state of emergency in Florida and authorised the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster-relief efforts. He told reporters that \u201cMar-a-Lago can handle itself\u201d and that he was more worried about Florida generally.\n\nAs Dorian closed in, Labour Day weekend plans were upended nationwide. Major airlines began allowing travellers to change their reservations without fees. The big cruise lines began rerouting their ships. Meanwhile, Disney World and Orlando\u2019s other resorts found themselves in the storm\u2019s projected path.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press", "description": "The Bahamas and the southeastern US are bracing for Hurricane Dorian as it barrels towards the region with an unclear trajectory and chance of \u201cstrong winds and life-threatening storm surge\u201d, according to the National Hurricane Centre.", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/31/21/hurricane.dorian.jpg"}
