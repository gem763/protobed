Do we all have the courage to ask them?\n\nHartford Courant\n\nSept. 29\n\nThe revelations of the last week - President Donald Trump\u2019s phone call with a foreign power, allegations that the White House tried to cover it up - are very serious, and every American should agree to that. But the divisions over the president\u2019s behavior seem to be widening, and in many ways, that\u2019s just as serious.\n\nThe rough transcript of the telephone conversation between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president, in which Mr. Trump explicitly requested interference in the electoral process, is the smoking gun that was largely absent in the Mueller report. It constitutes clear and incontrovertible evidence of an impeachable offense.\n\nSo why is the country so divided about it? Why are Republicans from the Naugatuck Valley to Capitol Hill insisting that it\u2019s a witch hunt, that the president did nothing wrong, that former Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. is the person who should be investigated, that the Democrats are still angry that Hillary lost? And why are Democrats so bewildered that anyone could support the president after all he\u2019s done?\n\nIt\u2019s time for Democrats to listen seriously to what Republicans are saying - and for Republicans to reassess their unwavering support of the president.\n\nConsider the case of Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, who was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company. President Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, according to the transcript: \u201cThe other thing, There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nIt may well be worth looking into Hunter Biden\u2019s position more closely. Even if the investigation has already been closed and the Bidens found to have done nothing wrong, Democrats should be willing to acknowledge that Hunter Biden\u2019s mere presence on the board while his father was vice president looks fishy. Is it worth investigating all over again? It\u2019s worth asking the question, at least.\n\nBut at the same time, Republicans and supporters of President Trump have to be able to separate the Hunter Biden question from the issue of Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct. Everyone, Republican and Democrat alike, should be able to agree that American elections should not be open to other countries and that other countries should not be allowed - or invited - to participate, interfere or assist a particular candidate. The integrity of the American political process is sacrosanct.\n\nDemocrats should also be able to acknowledge that the question of whether Mr. Trump actually broke campaign finance law in his telephone call with Mr. Zelenskiy by seeking a \u201cthing of value\u201d is not cut and dried. There are reasonable interpretations on both sides. They should be discussed, rationally, without the interference of political passion.\n\nAnd at the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters should acknowledge that the question of whether he abused the power of the presidency by dangling military aid as a quid pro quo for political assistance is, also, a question that should be asked and answered.\n\nEver since Mr. Trump won the election, Republicans have asserted that Democrats are still bitter, still mad that Hillary Clinton lost, and will do anything to oppose him. But that\u2019s not it. This isn\u2019t about winning or losing or Hillary at all. It\u2019s about a president who has shown a propensity for lying from day one and an apparent disregard for the law - behavior that should concern us all.\n\nThose concerns have only grown more serious. Sadly, because of preconceptions about \u201cthe other side\u201d that have been fanned by hateful rhetoric, where one stands on the question of Mr. Trump is now an issue of personal identity.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be that way. This nation should be able to evaluate potentially impeachable behavior as rationally as possible.\n\nIn this case, President Trump\u2019s behavior appears to have crossed a clear line, and in the end, soliciting political assistance from a foreign power is illegal. Republicans should be able to acknowledge that much without feeling like their own values are at risk - because they aren\u2019t. Being Republican, or being conservative, does not mean one must bow before Mr. Trump.\n\nRepublican or Democrat, every true American believes that no one is above the law. It is a cornerstone of our Democracy. It\u2019s time to stand firm, and united, on that principle.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/31IY8QV\n\n___\n\nMAINE\n\nA remarkable hug reminds us to choose understanding and forgiveness\n\nBangor Daily News\n\nOct. 4\n\nEighteen-year-old Brandt Jean stunned a courtroom, and the world, with a simple request for a Texas judge on Wednesday. \u201cCan I give her a hug, please?\u201d\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been an extraordinary request, except that the woman Jean wanted to hug had the day before been convicted of murdering his brother, Botham Jean.\n\nAmber Guyger, who is white and was a Dallas police officer, entered Botham Jean\u2019s apartment last year. Thinking she was in her own apartment, she shot and killed Jean, a 26-year-old black man, who had been sitting on his couch and eating ice cream. She was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\n\u201cIf you truly are sorry - I know I can speak for myself - I, I forgive you,\u201d Brandt Jean told Guyger during a sentencing hearing. \u201cAnd I know if you go to God and ask Him, He will forgive you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you just like anyone else,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say I hope you rot and die, just like my brother did. . I personally want the best for you.\u201d\n\nJean then turned to Judge Tammy Kemp. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is possible, but can I give her a hug, please,\u201d he asked. \u201cPlease?\u201d\n\nThe judge said yes, and Jean stepped down from the witness stand and wrapped Guyger in his arms. Both sobbed.\n\nWe are not so naive to suggest that we can all be as forgiving and understanding as Jean. We suspect that a significant number of internet denizens who watched the video and gushed about how uplifting it was were, minutes later, back at their keyboards mocking \u201ctheir opponents.\u201d Yet, we should take a lesson from his extraordinary action, which has been shared by media around the world.\n\nThere is much more that unites us in our shared human experience than divides us. We are all human, no matter our race and ethnicity, our religion, our sexual orientation or party affiliation.\n\nWe live in a time when building walls - metaphorical and real - is a too common response to our misperceptions, our misunderstandings and our fears. Denigrating and fighting against those who cast a ballot for a different candidate, who came from a different country, or who worship a different god (or none at all) is wearing us down.\n\nJean reminds us that we have a different choice - we can choose forgiveness and understanding, despite what feels like a chasm between us.\n\nWe are all striving for a better life for ourselves and our family. For some, the path is straight and easy. For many, there are hardships that require assistance and understanding. Some make horrific mistakes. But, as Brandt Jean so eloquently voiced, we should all want what is best for one another - even if we have different ideas of what that means.\n\nWhen we condemn one another for how we look, how much money we make, what we value, where we come from, how we drive, who we love, where we shop and many other small differences, we throw up unnecessary roadblocks to our wellbeing as a nation, and a planet.\n\nThere was another popular video on social media this week. It showed an out-of-control catering cart circling perilously close to an airplane parked at a gate at O\u2019Hare airport in Chicago, spilling its cargo and scattering airport workers. Many joked that the chaos symbolized the current state of American affairs.\n\nBut there is a deeper question raised by the video. Who are we? Are we the circle of people mostly standing by, wondering what to do? Or are we the person who acts, using a ramp truck to stop the runaway cart, ending the chaos and danger?\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/31NHGip\n\n___\n\nMASSACHUSETTS\n\nAt long last, Senate pushes education funding forward\n\nThe Republican of Springfield\n\nOct. 4\n\nNo education funding package was going to satisfy everyone. The Massachusetts Senate version that passed by unanimous vote didn\u2019t do that.\n\nBut at long last, the Senate moved forward with a bill designed to launch the state into a new era of equal education opportunity. Now it goes to the House, where different philosophies on this package have existed, but the Senate\u2019s 39-0 vote makes a powerful case for acceptance.\n\nThe Student Opportunity Act will require an increase of $1.5 billion annually by the time it is fully implemented. That\u2019s a lot of money. But as a rule, most taxpayers accept spending on public education if they have the confidence that increased funding will actually produce better schools.\n\nSenators believe there will not be a need for new taxes or revenue streams, meaning existing resources can absorb it. Frankly, that remains to be seen over the seven-year phase-in period for implementation. But if it happens, the bill could prove to be worth the cost and then some.\n\nDebate over priorities, time frame and cost have been going on since 2015, when Massachusetts was deemed inadequate in serving needs that were not so prominent in 1993, the last time an educational overhaul took place. The fiscal 2018 and 2019 years in particular ended with disappointment and no resolution.\n\nThe Senate version is being supported by teacher unions and education advocates, and hopefully not just out of relief that results are finally being delivered. The culminating debate did leave some ideas on the table.\n\nNo amendments were adopted regarding charter schools and reimbursements. Northampton senator Jo Comerford was disappointed that even greater special education increases were not included.\n\nOne amendment that was adopted will require local school committees to approve plans to address achievement gaps with input from parents, including parents of special education students and English language learners. It would set \u201cmeasurable targets\u201d for reducing achievement gaps.\n\nMassachusetts sits at an education crossroads. There are many admirable qualities in our schools, some as a carryover result of the 1993 legislation and others through the diligence of local administrators, teachers and an increasingly active parent base.\n\nWill 21st Century needs be adequately addressed? Will kids from lower income areas, and not just those in more affluent districts, get a fair chance?\n\nThe Senate version says yes. Now it\u2019s up to the House to see if this long-awaited reform can continue moving forward.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/30Nvih0\n\n___\n\nNEW HAMPSHIRE\n\nTime to add \u2018Lost 74\u2019 to Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall\n\nFoster\u2019s Daily Democrat\n\nOct. 4\n\nIt can happen and it should happen.\n\nLast week, Seacoast Sunday shared the story of the \u201cLost 74,\u201d a group of Navy personnel killed during the Vietnam War when their destroyer was accidentally sliced in half by an Australian aircraft carrier. Seventy-four men were killed in service to their country during a war.\n\nAmong those lost were 21-year-old Gary Joseph Vigue, a 1965 Dover High School graduate who left behind a wife and a 5-month-old son.\n\nHowever, because the accident occurred outside the designated combat zone of the time, the men who make up the \u201cLost 74\u201d don\u2019t qualify for inclusion on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C. That is wrong and must be corrected as soon as possible as the fatal accident occurred June 3, 1969.\n\nExcluding those who made the ultimate sacrifice because of an arbitrary line is out of touch with reality. Thankfully though, U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Angus King of Maine are two co-sponsors of a bill to have the sailors\u2019 names added to the memorial.\n\nThis follows Shaheen\u2019s efforts to help secure a memorial at Arlington National Cemetery for the 129 men lost April 10, 1963, when USS Thresher sank and imploded during sea trials off the coast of Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cIt is long overdue that these men join their fellow fallen brothers and receive the recognition they deserve on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall,\u201d Shaheen said recently. \u201cBoundary lines drawn in the water shouldn\u2019t determine the respect we pay our servicemen and women killed in the line of duty - they gave their lives for this country and their sacrifice deserves equal recognition.\u201d\n\nPerfectly said.\n\nKevin Galeaz of Hooksett and commander of USSVI Thresher Base, led the effort to create the Thresher memorial in Arlington. Its creation, he said, \u201cmeant everything to me because the family members finally had solace. They had been waiting for 56 years for this memorial to be placed in Arlington National Cemetery.\u201d\n\nGaleaz also said the monument helps maintain the legacy of those lost aboard Thresher and perpetuates the story of the Thresher and the submarine safety measures enacted after its loss.\n\nThe Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall not only enshrines the legacy of the men and women who lost their lives during the war, it serves as a continuous source of healing in a nation divided by that conflict. It brings balance to how the soldiers and sailors of the Vietnam War were treated upon their return to the States.\n\nService to our country is one of the most noble things men and women can do. All steps must be taken to enshrine those who die in service of their country.\n\nThe legislation to add the \u201cLost 74\u201d to the wall should be passed swiftly and those in charge of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall should follow suit with the same sense of urgency.\n\nIn the event some want to stand at an imaginary line, they might instead think of stating their case while looking into the eyes of widows, children and other family members left without a husband, father, son or brother. It\u2019s hard to imagine one would be so entrenched as to not feel compassion and compelled to do the right thing.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2MedRAP\n\n___\n\nRHODE ISLAND\n\nA vote for R.I. development\n\nThe Providence Journal\n\nOct. 2\n\nIt is encouraging news for Rhode Island\u2019s economy that the 195 Redevelopment Commission last week approved the final design of a $300-million luxury apartment tower that would be the tallest building in the state.\n\nHope Point Tower would house 800 to 900 residents, attracting people who work in hospitals, universities and other businesses, as well as \u201cempty nesters\u201d who want to live in the city, according to developer Jason Fane. That would breathe life into the downtown, encouraging business activity.\n\nA 2017 Appleseed study estimated that the 46-story Hope Point Tower could generate $273 million in statewide economic impact, and a one-time increase of $146 million in the Rhode Island economy, Mr. Fane said.\n\nAnd even with $25 million in tax credits from the state, the building would generate enormous tax revenues. The building is expected to produce $70 million in property taxes alone over the next 20 years, and some $250 million over the next 40 years, Mr. Fane contends.\n\nBut there are more hurdles to jump.\n\nAs Mark Patinkin wrote in his Sept. 29 column (\u201cTower developer runs into the height of bureaucracy\u201d), Mr. Fane has been trying to get his project underway for three long years in Rhode Island, and he doesn\u2019t have a shovel in the ground yet. He was 73 when he started; he is 76 now. How much longer will he retain the fire in the belly to build in Providence?\n\nMr. Fane confessed to Mr. Patinkin that \u201cif he\u2019d known it would be this hard, he wouldn\u2019t have tried. In his half century as a developer he\u2019s never faced delays like this.\u201d\n\nRhode Island is a state badly in need of economic development. It should be rolling out the carpet for those who want to invest serious money here. Mr. Fane\u2019s $300 million tower could be the biggest private project in Providence in decades.\n\nUnfortunately, it was drawn into the abyss of local politics when opponents, some of them business competitors, protested against its modern architectural design. Mayor Jorge Elorza at one point foolishly vetoed it, despite presiding over a city with a pension debt in the range of $1 billion.\n\nOthers, of course, have argued that modern architecture is part of many historic cities, providing new energy and bringing in more business activity. Friedrich St. Florian, the esteemed architect of the National World War II Memorial in Washington, said such a stylish luxury building would complete the Providence \u201crenaissance\u201d by attracting highly mobile professionals to the city.\n\nThe state eventually had to take control of state land in legislation passed this year, which should streamline this process for future developers while providing checks and balances.\n\nWhile Mr. Fane has been trying to build, the state rejected a plan to construct a state-of-the-art $1-billion energy plant in Burrillville. It also declined to make a $23-million investment in a new public ballpark that would have kept Triple-A baseball in Rhode Island and revitalized downtown Pawtucket. Meanwhile, it spent $22 million on one pedestrian bridge that went wildly over budget.\n\nWe just hope other developers around the country do not read of Mr. Fane\u2019s travails and conclude they would have to be insane to try to invest in Rhode Island. With this approval, and the movement of this project forward, perhaps Rhode Island can take a sad song and make it better.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2oawFsJ\n\n___\n\nVERMONT\n\nDoubts raised\n\nThe Rutland Herald\n\nOct. 2\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders has had a week of ups and downs as a candidate for the White House.\n\nThe Vermont independent raised $25.3 million in the past three months, his campaign said Tuesday, a total that continues to demonstrate his strength with small donors as he fights to maintain support in key early-voting states.\n\nThe financial haul, among the first that a candidate has announced for the third quarter, has again placed Sanders in the top tier of the field for fundraising.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, a different news cycle took hold.\n\nThe 78-year-old Sanders was taken to a Las Vegas hospital after he experienced chest discomfort during a campaign event Tuesday and sought medical evaluation. Two stents were \u201csuccessfully inserted,\u201d and Sanders \u201cis conversing and in good spirits,\u201d according to officials in his campaign.\n\nFurthermore, the campaign proved deftly opportunistic.\n\nIt noted the candidate had a heart procedure to highlight the benefits of his trademark Medicare for All health care plan.\n\nSanders would rest for a few days after the relatively common procedure, his campaign for the November 2020 presidential election said.\n\nSanders\u2019 speechwriter, David Sirota, said in a daily newsletter that the unexpected medical procedure was \u201ca perfect example of why the United States needs to join the rest of the world and pass Bernie\u2019s Medicare for All legislation.\u201d\n\nSirota cited a 2018 paper by researchers at the London School of Economics that found cardiac implant devices cost up to six times more in the United States than in some European countries with government-run health care systems.\n\nSanders advocates an approach that would extend the existing Medicare program for Americans aged over 65 to all Americans and largely eliminate the private insurance industry.\n\nSirota argued the gulf in price was in part due to the U.S. health care system\u2019s \u201ccomplex web of payers - rather than a single-payer Medicare for All system that can negotiate better prices.\u201d\n\nAs many as 1 million Americans a year get stents, a procedure that involves inserting a balloon-tipped catheter to open blockage and deploy tiny wire-mesh tubes to prop open the artery. It is commonplace, and rarely life-threatening.\n\nNews of Sanders\u2019 health scare sparked mean-spirited jokes pointing out the U.S. senator was treated by the health care system he wants to overhaul, according to Reuters.\n\n\u201cAny bets on whether he\u2019ll be going to Cuba for their great communist medical care? Get well soon Bern. #SocialismSucks!\u201d tweeted Ben Bergquam, a right-wing California radio host.\n\nAnd worse, other questions were raised: Does this signal concern for the candidate\u2019s long-term health, especially given the rigors of running for president? And, despite the pointed message about universal health care, should Sanders instead be considering handing the baton to another candidate?\n\nSome would suggest such an idea is ludicrous. The Democratic field\u2019s oldest candidate is raising a hefty war chest, and has remained on point, even when chest pains slowed him down to a dull roar.\n\nBut those are the Bernie supporters. Other critics were blunt in their estimation of the race moving forward. Social media was filled with armchair critics who said this marked the first day of Sanders\u2019 demise. Pundits were also having a field day with the news.\n\nPolitical watchers noted that any persistent questions about health and longevity could have ramifications not just for Sanders\u2019 campaign, but also all the Democratic front-runners and President Trump.\n\nAll of the candidates in their 70s are \u201cgoing to get more scrutiny if there\u2019s any physical or mental issues that arise,\u201d said Peter Hart, a longtime Democratic pollster and strategist who is neutral in the primary.\n\nHowever, given recent history, they won\u2019t necessarily \u201cbe ignored or passed over by voters\u201d merely for undergoing a medical procedure.\n\n\u201cIf you get multiple issues, or a very serious mental or physical problem, that will change the equation for the candidate,\u201d Hart said. \u201cWhat voters are really looking for is how this person performs and are his or her mental faculties all together.\u201d\n\nAnd this is the second time during the 2020 campaign that health problems have forced Sanders to ease up on what has otherwise been a robust schedule. Just last month, he canceled appearances in South Carolina because he lost his voice.\n\nBut in the high-stakes arena of U.S. politics, doubt has now been raised. We agree voters need to take health - physical and mental - into consideration. It remains to be seen how this blip on the Sanders EKG will affect the campaign overall. We still have our doubts.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2Vg3O2q\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Editorials from around New England:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
