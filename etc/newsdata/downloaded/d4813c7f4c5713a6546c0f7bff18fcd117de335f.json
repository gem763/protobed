Yet before he truly took off, Mahomes was caught looking behind him \u2014 where only an official was. There were no Lions or Chiefs players in sight.\n\nPatrick Mahomes looking back at the ref for a flag in the middle of the play \ud83e\udd23#KCvsDET pic.twitter.com/9l7PNGaURC \u2014 FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) September 29, 2019\n\nMahomes, he hilariously revealed this week, was actually looking for a flag on the field.\n\nIf one had been thrown, he said, he didn\u2019t want to waste all his energy sprinting down field for nothing.\n\n\u201cI looked back to see if there was a penalty,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cI saw that I had the room and could probably get the first down. But I didn't want to run like 50 yards if it was gonna get called back and I\u2019d have to run another play.\u201d\n\nThe move isn\u2019t one Mahomes has ever done before. And had he seen a flag been thrown, Mahomes said he still would have ran for the first down \u2014 it just wouldn\u2019t have been at a full sprint.\n\nWhile the move \u2014 in a weird way \u2014 makes sense, the 24-year-old still doesn\u2019t understand it now that he\u2019s a few days removed.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegardless, everything worked out and the Chiefs are still undefeated. No harm done.\n\n\u201cWhen I look back on it, I was like, \u2018Man, I don\u2019t know why I did that,\u2019\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cBut in the moment, I just kind of thought about it, and I looked back and saw there was no flag, so I took off.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "During a 25-yard run on Sunday in Detroit, Patrick Mahomes was caught staring down an official.
