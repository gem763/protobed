All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2013 a lynching. But we will WIN!\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nLEMON: Is there a difference Dr. West between Clarence Thomas making that sort of accusation vs. the president?\n\nWEST: The difference is that Thomas and people who are beautifully black like him have been the victims disproportionately as opposed to a vanilla brother or a vanilla sister. But he\u2019s still wrong. He\u2019s still wrong. Because it allows the use of the term to become so normalized that you act as if it was not tied to crimes against humanity, forms of American terrorism and linked to slavery in that way.\n\nThe stress has to be to the response to it. We black folk have never looked white supremacy in the eye and didn\u2019t come out fighting at our best. The question becomes how do we come out fighting now? We\u2019ve got fascism running afoot. You\u2019ve got disregard of rule of law. You\u2019ve got the balkanization of the populous. You\u2019ve got the devaluing and scapegoating of the weak, especially the Mexicans and Muslims and poor and black and brown. So the democracy is being imploded as it were. And you have to come up with ways of awakening moral, spiritual and political that allow for the democracy to go to move forward.\n\nThis is why if things don\u2019t work the way the system is we got to hit the streets, we\u2019ve got to go to jail. That\u2019s exactly what Out Now is all about. Next Saturday, every Saturday it\u2019s going to be like Puerto Rico. It\u2019s going to like Hong Kong.\n\nThe people have to speak with their feet if the election political system is too weak. The Republicans are too cowardly; the Democrats not moving fast enough. And with Biden using the language he used, he disqualifies himself. Thank God for brother Bernie. You just disqualified yourself in having any moral authority when it comes to this crime against humanity.", "description": "On Tuesday night's broadcast of \"CNN Tonight,\" Harvard professor Cornel West called for protests if President Donald Trump was not held accountable for things like referring to the impeachment inquiry as a \"lynching\" on social media. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/SafariScreenSnapz001-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
