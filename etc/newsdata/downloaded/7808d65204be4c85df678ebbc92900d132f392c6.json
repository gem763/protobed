You've got people and companies not willing to pay for business seats, retirees and high income individuals who want that little bit of extra comfort who are turning to premium economy.\n\n'It will improve our revenue quite significantly.'\n\nAnother spokesman for Qantas said people who generally fly economy with Qantas should be squirreling away their points with the aim to convert them into a premium economy upgrade.\n\nThe restructuring of the points system which took place last month will make it even easier to convert loyalty into upgrades, he said.\n\nEconomy - SYDNEY - LONDON: $2,100\n\nDaily Mail reporter Brittany Chain tries out economy class on the tour of the upgraded Qantas A380\n\nWhile the new leather headrests and fresh upholstery give the ground floor a fresh feel, economy passengers have been largely forgotten in the multi-million dollar upgrades\n\nWhile the new leather headrests and fresh upholstery give the ground floor a fresh feel, economy passengers have been largely forgotten in the multi-million dollar upgrades.\n\nQantas CEO Alan Joyce told Daily Mail Australia the removal of a dozens of economy seats was no more than a sign of the times.\n\n'We've gone back to the future a little bit with that decision,' he said.\n\n'We never had economy seats on the upper level when we first introduced the fleet.'\n\nEconomy ticket holders won't see any new menu items for at least a year, according to Neil Perry's team.\n\nDespite there being no major changes for economy seats - customers can rest assured they'll have access to premium entertainment services\n\nDespite there being no major changes for economy seats - customers can rest assured they'll have access to premium entertainment services\n\nEconomy ticket holders won't see any new menu items for at least a year, according to Neil Perry's team\n\nThey've carefully curated a selection of wholefood products and on-trend health drinks for people willing to spend more money on better tickets, but said they are hoping to release a new range for economy by the end of 2020.\n\n'We are revising economy,' a spokeswoman for the chef told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'We understand that is where a lot of our customers are, and we are focusing on what we can do in that market.\n\n'In 2014 we evolved to a trayless service in economy.
