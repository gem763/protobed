You invest aftertax dollars in a plan, usually age-based, which provides a diversified investment allocation. The investment mix gradually reallocates, too, reducing equities in favor of fixed income as the beneficiary ages. You are not taxed on the money as it grows in the account, and when you withdraw your money, the capital gains are not taxed either, provided you use the money for a qualified educational expense. Some states also offer a tax break on contributions.", "description": "Investment in prepaid 529 plans continues to decline, and in many cases it's not hard to see why.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt6ab02bf9bf739003/5c76ba14670387985f9fdb8f/KarenWallace_1x1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-13"}
