Close to it. It didn't break the skin but I have what's called compound blisters on my skin which are eight or nine inches long \u2026 I had to carry my leg, and legs are very heavy when they're not connected to anything,\" he said.\n\nThe video below shows Parker's rescue:\n\nParker is a member of a local walking group, the Brisbane Bushwalkers, which launched a search party for him on Monday, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe president of the group called Parker a \"very competent and capable bushwalker,\" but Parker said he was left in the \"worst-possible scenario\" as he had not told anyone where he was going.\n\nHe said that what kept him going was his desire to see his family, including his children, his sister, and his ex-wife.\n\nHe became emotional in his interview from the hospital, where he said that his son, who is based in New Zealand, was flying in to see him.\n\n\"I have been disassociated with him for the last two years, so I only just came back together with him four or five weeks ago.\"\n\n\"That was the main reason, I wanted to get home to my kids.\"", "description": "Neil Parker was hiking outside of Brisbane when he fell six meters (20 feet) down a waterfall and had no way of being seen or calling for help.", "authors": ["Sin\u00e9ad Baker"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d820adb21214c450e6b3f97-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
