Many of the the other candidates are relatively unknown outside the Washington DC bubble.\n\nFind out more about the contenders", "description": "Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard accuses Mrs Clinton of a campaign to \"destroy my reputation\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13D4D/production/_109292218_gettyimages-1168831845.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
