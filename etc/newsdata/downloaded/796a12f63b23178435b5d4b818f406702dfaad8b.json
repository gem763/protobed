There is a deep-rooted (and incorrect) belief that the movement was dominated by bawdy, arrogant young men with a penchant for depicting women as victims. What\u2019s more, in recent years, the concept of the muse has been steered towards something more negative; a title reserved for women that can often imply a certain passivity. A new exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in London aims to challenge this view, by celebrating the oft-omitted women of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, whether artists, poets, wives, models or, indeed, muses. Here, the curators view the muse as a catalyst whose personality shines through the art and challenges our interpretation of familiar narratives.\n\nThe Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, formed in 1848, was a trio of rebellious young men \u2013 William Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais \u2013 who had become disillusioned with what they perceived as a lack of natural beauty in art. They wanted to paint from life, and so enlisted a number of women \u2013 dressmakers, servants, sisters, mistresses \u2013 to model for them. They placed them in famous settings from literature or legend, and by so doing found a way to explore the most pressing social anxieties of the time: sex, death and disease. Not only did these women\u2019s influence have an immeasurable influence on the Brotherhood\u2019s output, but they produced their own work too \u2013 poetry, paintings and sketches \u2013 that is just as worthy of study as their male peers.\n\nAs Elizabeth Prettejohn, a lead authority on the movement, states in her book The Art of the Pre-Raphaelites: \u201cIt is not sufficient to merely add some women to the Pre-Raphaelite canon. Instead, it is a matter of writing a wholly new, and different, story about Pre-Raphaelitism \u2013 a story in which the activities of women are no longer incidental, but necessary to the plot.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nDr Jan Marsh and Kirsty Stone Walker have risen to this challenge and curated an exhibition of works and artefacts by 12 Pre-Raphaelite Sisters, including Effie Millais (n\u00e9e Gray, also Mrs John Ruskin), Elizabeth Eleanor Rossetti (n\u00e9e Siddall) and Fanny Eaton (n\u00e9e Antwistle). Marsh has researched these women since the Eighties, and seems to know their lives as intimately as her own; how they were friends, love rivals, sisters-in-law, mentors, mentees and mutual admirers of one another\u2019s work.\n\nGray, who suffered a disastrous marriage to the critic and artist John Ruskin before leaving him for Millais, was known to be lively, flirtatious and clever. She negotiated commissions and fees for Millais, and once borrowed a skirt from a woman in the street because it was the right colour he needed for his painting, The Blind Girl. Joanna Boyce battled to have paintings accepted at the Royal Academy before attending a \u201cladies class\u201d in Paris where she wrote of nude models in a life-drawing glass: \u201cAny girl may draw as I have been drawing yesterday and this morning, as free from harm or any danger of it, as though they studied a bunch of flowers or a landscape.\u201d Boyce died in childbirth, and upon her death her friend Rossetti is said to have described her as \u201ca great artist sacrificed to bringing more kids into the world\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Top artworks to see 1/30 Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa (c.1503) at The Louvre, Paris It's the mysteriously serene smile of this painting's subject \u2013 thought to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine fabric merchant \u2013 that has given it universal fame. The portrait's small size \u2013 it measures 77 x 53 cm \u2013 can still be a surprise to those jostling for a glimpse of it, but it is the earliest Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait. RMN-Grand Palais (Louvre Museum) 2/30 Johannes Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring (c.1665) at the Mauritshuis in The Hague As she looks around with her slightly parted lips, you can\u2019t help but wonder what this painting's sitter is about to say. There is an almost photorealist quality to this painting of an anonymous girl with a pearl earring \u2013 immortalised by Scarlett Johannson in the 2003 film. Vermeer, the Dutch Golden Age painter, died impoverished \u2013 he only painted two or three paintings a year because he worked so slowly, and the world forgot about his work until it was rediscovered in the 19th century. Public domain 3/30 Peter Doig's Blotter (1993) at Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool There is something so tranquil and magical about Doig's paintings. This purple-hued work from a family snapshot is of his brother standing on a frozen pond and looking down into the reflection. Images reflected in water are common in his work \u2013 as seen in White Canoe (1991) and Echo Lake (2000) \u2013 and function as \u201centrances to other worlds\". National Museums Liverpool Collection \u00a9 Peter Doig, DACS 2019. Courtesy Michael Werner Gallery, New York and London 4/30 Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus (1485-1486) at the Uffizi Gallery, Florence The Renaissance painting is the highlight of the Uffizi in Florence for good reason \u2013 it's a triumphant celebration of female beauty. Venus, with her long flowing hair, has been blown by the gentle breeze onto the shore of Cyprus and balances on a giant scallop shell. A young woman, thought to be Hora of spring or one of the graces, holds out a cloak covered in flowers. Public domain 5/30 Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508) in Vatican City This breathtaking sequence of scenes from the Book of Genesis covers the ceiling of one of the chapels in the Vatican, and includes Michelangelo's best known fresco of the Creation of Adam. The Italian Renaissance painter was commissioned to paint it in 1508 by Pope Julius 11 \u2013 he even designed his own scaffold to paint up so high. Public domain 6/30 Gustav Klimt's The Kiss (1907-1908) at the \u00d6sterreichische Galerie Belvedere, Vienna Nothing can be as irresistibly romantic as Klimt\u2019s oil painting, which shimmers with gold leaf and depicts two lovers entwined in a loving embrace. Both wear patterned robes which reference the contemporary style of Art Nouveau and the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. It is a departure from the artist\u2019s usual portrayal of woman as the femme fatale. Belvedere 7/30 Claude Monet's Impression, Sunrise (1872) at The Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet, Paris It is easy to get lost for hours in the calmness of Monet\u2019s hazy scene of the port of Le Havre, with a rising red sun casting shadows onto small boats. When it was first shown in a group show in Paris in 1874, the painting that gave Impressionism its name was criticised for looking unfinished. Public domain 8/30 Hokurai's The Great Wave (1829-1832) at The British Museum, London There is something seductively dangerous about this enormous, claw-like wave, that is about to break and engulf three fishing boats off Kanagawa in Japan. The woodblock print is the first in the Japanese artist\u2019s series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It is one of the most famous Japanese artworks in the world. Public domain 9/30 Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night (1889) at The Museum of Modern Art, New York Van Gogh painted this night sky from a view from his room at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Remy, France, where he was admitted for mental illness after cutting off his own ear. With its intense swirling patterns, van Gogh manages to conjure up a whirling vista above a sleepy village, with the crescent moon, stars, Venus and orbs. The Museum of Modern Art 10/30 Rembrandt van Rijn's The Night Watch (1642) at Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam This militia painting threw formality out of the window with its sense of movement and action. Rembrandt even painted himself hidden in the scene, which depicts Captain Banning Cocq and 17 members of his civic militia guards \u2013 all of whom commissioned the painting. Rembrandt puts a spotlight on the main characters with his trademark use of light and shadow, including a woman carrying a chicken. Public domain 11/30 Theodore Gericault's The Raft of the Medusa (1818-1819) at The Louvre, Paris This lifesize painting, which measures about 16 feet by 23.5 feet, almost takes you with it on its doomed journey. The then-27-year-old Gericault drew inspiration from a real tragedy of men aboard a French naval frigate in 1816. Only 10 of the 150 men who boarded the raft lived. It is regarded as an icon of Romanticism for its emotive composition and interest in the natural world. Public domain 12/30 Tracey Emin's I Could Feel You (2014) at Tate Britain, London The Young British Artist is better known for her installations such as My Bed (1998) but it is no surprise that her paintings also hint at being candidly autobiographical in her examination of the female body. This is one of six related works on paper, each with a sensual title (Just Waiting, Stay Up, All for You), which is painted in black gouache. Tracey Emin 13/30 Mt St Victoire, Cezanne (c.1895) at Princeton University Art Museum, New Jersey Post-Impressionist painter Cezanne, with his bold, flat use of colour, painted the mountains in southern France overlooking his hometown Aix-en-Provence many times. His new ways of depicting perspective by simplifying objects to planes and geometric shapes was a big influence on the later Cubists, especially Picasso, who called him \u201cmy only master\u201d. Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection 14/30 Pablo Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) at the Museum of Modern Art, New York Picasso used geometric forms to portray the female body in this striking painting of five nude sex workers in a brothel in Barcelona. His new style kick-started Cubism, a movement that he and Georges Braque invented and which resulted in abstract and fragmented paintings. AFP/Getty 15/30 Marcel Duchamp's The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (1915-1923) at Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia Duchamp\u2019s bizarre artwork, that he declared as \u201cpermanently unfinished\u201d, is meant to evoke the erotic tension between the bride and the bachelors. Known as The Large Glass, as it is over nine feet, it comrpises two shattered glass panels suspended vertically, which contain a mechanical-like bride, a large shape that references the Milky Way, nine bachelors in geometric shapes and mechanical objects, all painted in oil to give it colour. Gaby Av (CC BY 2.0)[scald=5963576:sdl_editor_representation] 16/30 Andy warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans (1962), Andy Warhol at the Museum of Modern Art, New York This artwork, which consisted of 32 canvases, each painted with a Campbell soup can in different flavour, helped to introduce pop art as a major art movement in the US. It led to many more works depicting Campbell Soup cans over his career \u2013 ones with torn labels or opened lids, many being produced at The Factory, where studio assistants created them for him. Wally Gobetz (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) 17/30 Bosch's The Garden of Earthy Delights (1503-1515) at Museo del Prado, Madrid The central panel of this extraordinary triptych oil painting on oak panel shows a manic utopia of male and female nudes cavorting with wild abandon, often with animals. The left panel shows Christ blessing Eve before she is presented to Adam while the right panel illustrates Hell. It is likely this work, by the Danish artist Bosch, is a warning against lust. Museo del Prado 18/30 Jasper Johns's Flag (1954-1955) at the Museum of Modern Art, New York The American artist dreamt he painted a large American flag and got on with it promptly the next morning. Now it is the painting for which he is best known, painted over strips of newspaper visible beneath the see-through paint, locating the painting in the McCarthy era and at the beginning of the Cold War. EPA 19/30 Damien Hirst's Anthraquinone-1-Diazonium Chloride (1994) at Tate Liverpool This famous example of a Spot Painting \u2013 rows of randomly coloured circles \u2013 was produced by Hirst\u2019s assistants. The artist produced about 60 Spot Paintings a year from 1986 to 2011. For Hirst, who is reportedly now the UK's richest living artist, they were just \u201ca way of pinning down the joy of colour\u201d. 20/30 Salvador Dal's The Persistence of Memory (1931) at the Museum of Modern Art, New York Time and space have a hallucinatory quality in this instantly recognisable surrealist painting of melting watches. The human face, visible on an abstract form, with its long eyelashes, represents Dali. This painting was fuelled by the artist's interest in the dream analysis of Sigmund Freud, and made him a star at the age of 28. Getty 21/30 Lucien Freud's Girl with a White Dog(1951) at Tate, London Freud was known for his psychologically complex figurative portraits, and this painting of his first wife Kitty Garman, who was pregnant at the time of the sitting, is no exception. The artist manages to reveal a multitude of emotions in the composition. He painted her many times during their short marriage, which ended in divorce in 1952, due to his many infidelities. Getty 22/30 Edvard Munch's The Scream (1893) at The National Museum, Oslo from 2020 This painting came about when Munch was overcome by fear and anxiety during a walk with two friends, and \u201cthe sky suddenly turned to red\u201d. The location was in earshot of his sister\u2019s lunatic asylum, but it is said to capture the universal anxiety of modern man. It is currently waiting to be rehoused in the new National Museum in Oslo. Nasjonalmuseet 23/30 John Henry Fuseli's The Nightmare (1781) at Detroit Institute of Art, Michigan This sexually charged painting of a woman lying across a bed, as a demonic creature crouches on her chest, has been an icon of horror, ever since it was first exhibited at the annual RA exhibition in 1782. Is she having a nightmare? Is it referencing Fuseli\u2019s own love life? Or is it about female desire? The artwork created shock and intrigue in its day and made Fuseli famous. Detroit Institute of Arts 24/30 Bridget Riley's Nataraja (1993) at Tate Modern, London When Bridget Riley first created her black and white abstract paintings in the 1960s \u2013 known as op art \u2013 the images seemed to actually move. The brightly coloured diagonal stripes in this later painting, inspired by a trip to India, also creates a sense of movement. She created it on paper in gouache, before handing it over to her studio assistants, to transfer it onto canvas. Tate 25/30 Jackson Pollock's Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) (1950) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Pollock had already created his first \"drip painting\" in 1947, sending shockwaves through the art world. The technique, which involved painting on a canvas laid flat on the floor and pouring, dripping, even splattering paint onto it \u2013 with a degree of control \u2013 is at its peak in Autumn Rhythm, which is evocative of nature. He died in a car crash aged 44 in 1956. Met Museum 26/30 \u00c9douard Manet's Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019herbe (1862) at the Musee d\u2019Orsay, Paris This painting caused a scandal when it was first exhibited in Paris in 1863. The scene of a naked woman having a picnic with two fully clothed men is still jarring. But in Manet\u2019s day, female nudes usually represented figures from mythology, like goddesses. This painting, which places the nude in an everyday setting, was a departure point for Modern Art as Manet refused to toe the line. RMN (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay)/Herv\u00e9 Lewandowski 27/30 Frida Kahlo's Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) at Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, Austin The Mexican surrealist artist found painting self-portraits therapeutic. This one reveals her suffering; her long lasting pain after a bus accident; her infertility; her divorce from artist Diego Rivera and the end of her affair with photographer Nikolas Muray. Bursting with symbolism from Mexican folklore, it is a jigsaw puzzle of meaning. AFP/Getty 28/30 Diego Vel\u00e1zquez's Las Meninas (1656) at Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid, Spain The leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age captures himself working on a large canvas in this realistic portrayal of the Spanish court, where he was court painter. The young princess Infanta Margarita Theresa is surrounded by servants, while her parents King Philip 1V of Spain and Mariana of Austria, watch the scene from a doorway. It holds plenty of mystery as to the relationship between the viewer and the characters depicted. For example, does the mirror reflect the hidden picture on the easel? Public domain 29/30 Henri Matisse's Conversation (1908-1912) at the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg What are they talking about? It looks serious. Matisse\u2019s oil painting depicts the artist and his wife Amelie in conversation against an intense sapphire blue colour. Matisse wears striped pyjamas, which were fashionable as leisurewear in 20th century France. It was painted in his country house, and there is a tension in the way his wife sits \u2013 understandable, given that he reportedly once told her that he loved painting more than her. Gandalf's Gallery (CC BY-SA 2.0) 30/30 Sir John Everett Millais's Ophelia (1851-1852) at Tate Britain, London A drowning Ophelia from Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet is slowly sinking into the stream. The Pre-Raphaelite artist recreated, with breathtaking attention to detail, the consequence of Hamlet\u2019s murder of her father. His 19-year old model, Lizzie Siddal, nearly died of a cold from lying in a bath fully clothed for hours, long after oil lamps used to keep the bath water warm went out. The artist did not notice but ended up paying her doctor\u2019s bills. John Everett Millais 1/30 Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa (c.1503) at The Louvre, Paris It's the mysteriously serene smile of this painting's subject \u2013 thought to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine fabric merchant \u2013 that has given it universal fame.

RMN (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay)/Herv\u00e9 Lewandowski 27/30 Frida Kahlo's Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) at Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, Austin The Mexican surrealist artist found painting self-portraits therapeutic. This one reveals her suffering; her long lasting pain after a bus accident; her infertility; her divorce from artist Diego Rivera and the end of her affair with photographer Nikolas Muray. Bursting with symbolism from Mexican folklore, it is a jigsaw puzzle of meaning. AFP/Getty 28/30 Diego Vel\u00e1zquez's Las Meninas (1656) at Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid, Spain The leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age captures himself working on a large canvas in this realistic portrayal of the Spanish court, where he was court painter. The young princess Infanta Margarita Theresa is surrounded by servants, while her parents King Philip 1V of Spain and Mariana of Austria, watch the scene from a doorway. It holds plenty of mystery as to the relationship between the viewer and the characters depicted. For example, does the mirror reflect the hidden picture on the easel? Public domain 29/30 Henri Matisse's Conversation (1908-1912) at the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg What are they talking about? It looks serious. Matisse\u2019s oil painting depicts the artist and his wife Amelie in conversation against an intense sapphire blue colour. Matisse wears striped pyjamas, which were fashionable as leisurewear in 20th century France. It was painted in his country house, and there is a tension in the way his wife sits \u2013 understandable, given that he reportedly once told her that he loved painting more than her. Gandalf's Gallery (CC BY-SA 2.0) 30/30 Sir John Everett Millais's Ophelia (1851-1852) at Tate Britain, London A drowning Ophelia from Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet is slowly sinking into the stream. The Pre-Raphaelite artist recreated, with breathtaking attention to detail, the consequence of Hamlet\u2019s murder of her father. His 19-year old model, Lizzie Siddal, nearly died of a cold from lying in a bath fully clothed for hours, long after oil lamps used to keep the bath water warm went out. The artist did not notice but ended up paying her doctor\u2019s bills. John Everett Millais\n\nEvelyn de Morgan, who drew comparisons to Edward Burne-Jones (a fact that is said to have rattled his ego), enjoyed major success with exhibitions at the Grosvenor Gallery. The granddaughter of an earl, she had been born into the kind of upper-class society where the idea of a woman working as an artist was a scandal in itself. Yet she achieved a steady income by selling paintings to high-profile patrons, upon whom her husband, the ceramicist William de Morgan, depended to sustain their household. Fanny Eaton, the Jamaica-born daughter of a black slave and, most likely, a white plantation owner, became Britain\u2019s most visible woman of colour by modelling for Rossetti, Millais, Albert Moore, Frederick Sandys and Simeon Solomon.\n\nIt is the fault of art historians, not the artists themselves, that women have been so omitted from the Pre-Raphaelite narrative \u2013 particularly given the impact the movement had on Victorian society at the time. Their paintings caused uproar and scandal; upon displaying his Ophelia, Millais was castigated by a Times of London critic for placing her in a \u201cweedy ditch\u201d. Many of the women in these paintings had red hair and strong jawlines, going against the typical standards of beauty of the day. They were enigmatic, and pensive, with their own agency: think of Rossetti\u2019s Mary (modelled by his sister, Christina) in Ecce Ancilla Domini! (The Annunciation)\u200b. She looks terrified upon receiving the message from the Angel Gabriel that she will give birth to a child by God. It\u2019s a human reaction, something of which women in Victorian society were frequently deprived.\n\nFor too long, the ways in which these artists, men and women, supported one another \u2013 served as mentors, friends, confidantes \u2013 has been neglected. By showing just how essential the Pre-Raphaelite sisters were, including as artists in their own right, this new exhibition paints the movement as a whole in a much better light.\n\nPre-Raphaelite Sisters at the National Portrait Gallery runs until 26 January 2020", "description": "The Pre-Raphaelites get a bad rap. There is a deep-rooted (and incorrect) belief that the movement was dominated by bawdy, arrogant young men with a penchant for depicting women as victims. What\u2019s more, in recent years, the concept of the muse has been steered towards something more negative; a title reserved for women that\u00a0can often imply a certain passivity.", "authors": ["Roisin O'Connor"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/21/15/082-night-and-sleep-by-evelyn-de-morgan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
