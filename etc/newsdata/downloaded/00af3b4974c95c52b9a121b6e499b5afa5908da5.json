She says the girl was actually an adult sociopath.", "language": "en", "text": "She had traveled from Ukraine to the rolling hills and cornfields of Indiana, only to wind up on her own in a strange city. When police checked in with the girl in September 2014, it had been more than a year since she had seen or heard from her adoptive parents, who had changed her age from 11 to 22 on official documents and rented her an apartment before moving to Canada and leaving her behind.\n\nThat was only the start of the bizarre criminal case enveloping Michael and Kristine Barnett, who last week were charged with felony neglect.\n\nAccording to local media outlets, the couple, who have since divorced, haven\u2019t denied abandoning the girl just a little more than two years after they adopted her. But they disagree about whether she actually was a child \u2014 or an adult pretending to be one.\n\nAuthorities have said that the girl suffers from a rare bone growth disorder that results in dwarfism. But Kristine Barnett, 45, told WISH-TV that even using the term \u201cgirl\u201d to describe her was inaccurate. She told the station that the adoption was a \u201cscam\u201d and that the girl was a diagnosed psychopath and sociopath, who had been an adult the entire time they knew her.\n\nHer former husband, 43-year-old Michael Barnett, told a different story when interviewed by police earlier this month. As far as he was concerned, police said, the girl was a minor when they switched her age and left her behind in Lafayette, Ind. He also told detectives that his wife had counseled the girl to tell people that she was 22 if questioned, and to explain that she just looked young.\n\nBefore the criminal charges were filed last week, the pair were best known as the parents of \u201cboy genius\u201d Jake Barnett, who was diagnosed with autism at age 2. Warned that he might never speak or have normal social interactions, Kristine began tutoring him at home. By age 12, when he was profiled in the Indianapolis Star, Jake was taking college math classes and was being courted for research positions. Not long after the article appeared, he had his first paper published in an academic journal. National news outlets soon came calling, drawn to the feel-good tale of a child prodigy who emphasized that an autism diagnosis shouldn\u2019t be considered a bad thing.\n\nUnmentioned in the articles was the fact that the family had also adopted a disabled girl from Ukraine, who in 2010 came to live with them and their three sons in their cozy suburban home north of Indianapolis. The girl would later tell detectives that a different adoptive family had initially brought her to the United States in 2008. Though no details are provided in the police affidavit, there were apparently complications, because the Barnetts adopted her two years later.\n\nCourt records show that the Barnetts repeatedly tried to determine the girl\u2019s exact age. In June 2010, the year that she was adopted, one doctor estimated that she was 8. In 2012, another doctor conducted a skeletal survey and determined that she was likely 11, a year older than previously thought.\n\nThat same year, authorities say, the couple went to an Indiana probate court and legally changed their daughter\u2019s age to 22. Officials haven\u2019t yet explained how they were able to do so, but Kristine Barnett gave WISH-TV a copy of a letter that purportedly came from another doctor who said that the date on the girl\u2019s birth certificate was \u201cclearly inaccurate,\u201d since she had both the teeth and the secondary sex characteristics of a grown adult.\n\nThe station wasn\u2019t able to confirm the authenticity of the letter, which alleges the girl \u201chas made a career of perpetuating her age facade,\u201d since hospital officials declined to comment. The same document also claims the girl had been committed to a psychiatric hospital and diagnosed with sociopathic personality disorder in 2012 and, around that time, started to admit that she was over 18. Determining her true age was difficult, the letter states, because records provided by Ukrainian officials were \u201cgrossly incomplete\u201d and her condition, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, meant that the typical assessments weren\u2019t helpful.\n\nAmid this backdrop of familial drama, the Barnetts became prominent advocates for children with autism. Early in 2012, CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d devoted a segment to 13-year-old Jake Barnett, who they described as a \u201ca math and science prodigy.\u201d A diminutive dark-haired young girl dressed in a white cardigan can be seen in some of the footage, sitting quietly at a family dinner.\n\nIn 2013, Kristine Barnett\u2019s memoir, \u201cThe Spark: A Mother\u2019s Story of Nurturing, Genius, and Autism\u201d was published by Random House. NPR book critic Maureen Corrigan wrote in The Washington Post that the book was \u201ccompulsive reading,\u201d adding, \u201cBarnett not only fights heroically on Jake\u2019s behalf, she also beats down every other obstacle that life hurls at her and her family.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, not long after his 15th birthday, Jacob began taking classes at the prestigious Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario. His parents told the Star that they moved the whole family to Canada in the summer of 2013 so that he could follow his passion, putting their Indiana home on the market.\n\nAround that same time, the Barnett\u2019s adopted daughter told police, her parents rented her an apartment in downtown Lafayette, Ind., the home of Purdue University. She knew no one there. Michael Barnett later told detectives that he and his then-wife paid the rent on the apartment but didn\u2019t provide the girl with any other financial support.\n\nWhat happened next is unclear, though an anonymous law enforcement source told WLFI that the girl\u2019s neighbors \u201ctook her under their wing.\u201d Court documents obtained by WISH-TV show that she was evicted for not paying rent in May 2014, less than a year after her adoptive parents left her alone in the apartment. Since she left no forwarding address, court officers weren\u2019t able to figure out where she had gone, or follow up with her for the money she owed.\n\nThat same year, the Barnetts filed for divorce, according to the station. Though Jake still lives in Canada, where he is pursuing a PhD in quantum gravity at the Perimeter Institute, both Michael and Kristine have moved back to Indianapolis.\n\nIn September 2014, the Tippecanoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office tracked down their adoptive daughter at the behest of a school principal who had raised concerns, WLFI reported. Based on the medical records cited in the affidavit, she would have been 12 or 13 at the time. Legally, however, she was well into her mid-20s. Authorities haven\u2019t said what came of the meeting, and another five years would pass before the Barnetts were charged with neglect.\n\nWhat happened in the intervening years, too, is a mystery. The police affidavit states that the girl left Lafayette and Tippecanoe County in February 2016. Additional court filings unearthed by WISH-TV show that 15 days after that, another couple petitioned to become her guardians. The Barnetts filed an objection. In January 2018, the station reported, the new couple changed their mind about the adoption, for reasons that weren\u2019t specified. The Barnetts\u2019 petition was subsequently dismissed.\n\nThough charges were filed Wednesday, neither of the Barnetts have been booked or arraigned. Court records don\u2019t indicate if either has an attorney. And authorities have hinted that there could be even more strange details to come.\n\n\u201cThis is going to end up on a TV show,\u201d an anonymous law enforcement official told WLFI on Thursday.", "description": "\u201cThis is going to end up on a TV show,\u201d an anonymous law enforcement official told WLFI on Thursday.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix", "September At Am", "Antonia Noori Farzan Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
