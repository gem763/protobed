I am sad for all NBC News employees that the status quo has been blessed,\u201d McHugh told Fox News.\n\nFormer NBC News correspondent Linda Vester agreed.\n\n\u201cComcast/NBC Universal is extending the contract of an individual who lied to staff and shareholders when he said they \u2018have no secrets and nothing to hide.\u2019 Not only does it encourage harassment victims to start telling those secrets, it invites a shareholder lawsuit against Comcast,\u201d Vester told Fox News. \u201cIn my view, shareholders could sue the company for breach of fiduciary duty by using corporate assets to make secret payoffs for personal wrongs. What shareholder would agree to Comcast secretly using their money for coverups?\u201d\n\nVester is a vocal critic of the Peacock Network\u2019s culture since she accused Tom Brokaw of sexual misconduct last year (a claim Brokaw denied). Vester is part of a high-powered group of women who have called for a new investigation into alleged misconduct at the network.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that NBC quietly renewed Oppenheim\u2019s contract, citing \u201cpeople familiar with the matter.\u201d The reported decision raised eyebrows across the media industry, as Oppenheim has been at the center of numerous controversies in recent memory. In addition to the Weinstein scandal, Oppenheim was recently mocked by his own staffers when fielding questions about his knowledge of Matt Lauer\u2019s alleged misconduct, while controversial columns he wrote in college were unearthed earlier this month.\n\nNBC KILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS\n\n\"The contract renewal is a strong endorsement for an executive who has been at the center of such a controversy. These contracts are typically renewed for several years at a time, and Mr. Oppenheim is expected to succeed [NBC News chairman Andy] Lack after the 2020 presidential election,\u201d The Wall Street Journal wrote.\n\nNBC News did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation.\n\nNBCUniversal Chief Executive Steve Burke currently plans for Oppenheim to succeed Lack, according to the Journal. However, an NBCUniversal insider told Fox News that Burke is \u201cextremely fickle\u201d and has given extensions to executives before shortly before firing them in the past.\n\nAn online petition urging NBC News to fire Oppenheim has nearly 10,000 signatures.\n\n\u201cI take it that no Comcast board member has read Ronan\u2019s book or my article. I am sad for all NBC News employees that status quo has been blessed.\" \u2014 Rich McHugh\n\nShaunna Thomas, a co-founder of UltraViolet, a leading national women\u2019s organization, recently blasted Oppenheim by name, saying he \u201cfailed to hold sexual abusers accountable\u201d and \u201cfailed to combat a toxic culture across newsrooms.\u201d\n\n\u2018TODAY\u2019 ADDRESSES \u2018APPALLING\u2019 NEW MATT LAUER REPORT: 'IT\u2019S JUST VERY PAINFUL'\n\nThomas -- who called for Oppenheim to be fired earlier this month -- blasted the decision.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply disturbing that Comcast CEO Brian Roberts would show such poor judgment and renew its contract with Noah Oppenheim knowing full well that he was facing allegations of enabling sexual abusers in the workplace and had a record of silencing survivors and stories of survivors in the newsroom.\" \u2014 UltraViolet co-founder Shaunna Thomas\n\n\u201cIt is deeply disturbing that Comcast CEO Brian Roberts would show such poor judgment and renew its contract with Noah Oppenheim knowing full well that he was facing allegations of enabling sexual abusers in the workplace and had a record of silencing survivors and stories of survivors in the newsroom,\u201d Thomas told Fox News.\n\n\u201cThe rot at Comcast clearly goes to the top -- with the media giant caring more about short-term profits than about protecting its employees and safeguarding long-term shareholder value. This is a mistake that Comcast and NBC Universal will regret,\u201d Thomas added.\n\nMADDOW CELEBRATES NYT REPORTERS WHO EXPOSED WEINSTEIN SCANDAL, IGNORES HOW NBC SPIKED SAME STORY\n\nOppenheim famously told Farrow that his Weinstein reporting wasn\u2019t fit to print, so Farrow took it to The New Yorker where it won the Pulitzer Prize and helped launch the #MeToo movement. Oppenheim, who moonlights as a Hollywood screenwriter, has been under a microscope as Farrow\u2019s book details his version of why NBC refused to expose Weinstein \u2013 which includes allegations that the disgraced movie mogul leveraged the knowledge of former NBC News anchor Matt Lauer\u2019s own misconduct.\n\nThe book also suggests Oppenheim wasn\u2019t truthful regarding knowledge of Lauer\u2019s alleged misconduct. Farrow describes Oppenheim as a \u201cdoe-eyed stoner whose mellow seemed impossible to harsh\u201d and said they \u201claughed about his stories of getting high.\u201d Farrow also says he and Oppenheim \u201cplanned to spend a night in with some edibles\u201d before their eventual fallout over the Weinstein reporting.\n\nAfter the Weinstein and Lauer bombshells were reported in 2017, NBC refused to hire an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer\u2019s sexual misconduct and whether NBC executives looked the other way. NBC relied on in-house general counsel Kim Harris despite widespread calls for an outside law firm to conduct the review.\n\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED\n\nNBC eventually declared that management was completely oblivious to Lauer\u2019s behavior and Harris\u2019 high-powered colleagues were cleared by the network.\n\nOppenheim, who maintains that Farrow simply has \u201can axe to grind\u201d against NBC, was recently mocked by his own staff when he attempted to field questions from concerned employees as excerpts from Farrow\u2019s book began to surface.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes recently admitted his news division was \u201cembroiled in a very public controversy over its conduct\u201d and appeared to side with Farrow\u2019s reporting over the talking points that have been provided by Oppenheim.\n\n\u201cRonan Farrow walked out of NBC News after working on the Weinstein story, and within two months published an incredible article at The New Yorker that not only won a Pulitzer, but helped trigger a massive social and cultural reckoning that continues to this day,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cThe path of least resistance for those with power was not to cross Weinstein or his army of friends and lawyers.\u201d\n\nRONAN FARROW FIRES BACK AT NBC NEWS BOSS WHO HAS \u2018THE MOST TO LOSE FROM THE TRUTH\u2019\n\nOn Monday, author and activist Sil Lai Abrams said her own sexual misconduct bombshell was also shut down by Oppenheim\u2019s news operation.\n\n\u201cNBC put women\u2019s lives at risk,\u201d Abrams wrote in The Daily Beast. \u201cThis is one of the darkest of NBC\u2019s sins.\u201d\n\nAbrams \u2013 who tweeted that Oppenheim needs to be held accountable \u2013 did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nMeanwhile, NBC News has still not explained how the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape of Donald Trump was leaked from within Oppenheim\u2019s new division to the Washington Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold -- an old college buddy of Oppenheim.\n\nFahrenthold, like Farrow, won a Pulitzer Prize for stories that NBC News passed on under Oppenheim. Fahrenthold was later given a paid consultancy with NBC News.\n\nOppenheim and Fahrenthold attended Harvard University together, but NBC has long denied that Oppenheim leaked the scandalous tape to Fahrenthold.", "description": "NBC News Noah Oppenheim\u2019s contract was reportedly renewed by the Peacock Network despite an onslaught of negative attention surrounding Ronan Farrow\u2019s \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d which paints Oppenheim as a key figure in NBC\u2019s decision not to expose Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Rich Mchugh", "Ultraviolet Co-Founder Shaunna Thomas", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
