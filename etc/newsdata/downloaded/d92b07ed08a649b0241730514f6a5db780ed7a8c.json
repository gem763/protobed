Let me tell you \u2014 I practiced playing the clarinet a lot as a kid, and then even more as a teenager, and I never got anywhere near perfect. The sentiment, though, that we only get better at a thing by practicing that thing is still very valid. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s a better way to explain it: Imagine that you\u2019re building a \u201cbrain chain.\u201d\n\nBarbara Oakley, a self-described \u201cformer maths flunky\u201d who later became an engineer, has studied the process of learning in both adults and kids. She likes to visualise that as you practice a new skill or learn a new subject, you are slowly building a new chain in your brain. The Washington Post describes these \u201cbrain chains\u201d this way:\n\nThe more you practice a skill, the thicker the chain gets, until the task (such as solving a certain kind of maths problem) becomes automatic. For example, when you first sit down to learn a song on the piano, it\u2019s slow going. You focus on every note. But after a while, you can sit down and play the piece smoothly and accurately because you have a brain chain for that song. Every new skill is hardest at the beginning \u2014 and that\u2019s when a child will be tempted to give up and say, \u201cI can\u2019t do it!\u201d Encourage them to change that to, \u201cI can\u2019t do it \u2026 yet.\u201d\n\nThere are everyday activities we all do that seem automatic now but took careful step-by-step learning and practice to master, Oakley tells KQED Public Media \u2014 for example, learning how to back up a car.\n\n\u201cAny type of mastery involves the development of chains of procedural fluency,\u201d Oakley tells KQED. \u201cThen you can get into more complex areas of fluency.\u201d\n\nSo the next time your kid gets frustrated because they still can\u2019t ride a bike without tipping over, make it through that song without hitting the wrong note or solve a maths equation without assistance, remind them that they\u2019re still building that brain chain. The chain might never be perfectly constructed, but it will get thicker and stronger over time.", "description": "\u201cPractice makes perfect\u201d was never a very good saying.
