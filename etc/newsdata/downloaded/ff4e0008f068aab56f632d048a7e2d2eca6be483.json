It\u2019s just disrespectful, I think.\u201d\n\nBraves fans performed the tomahawk chop chant Thursday night when Helsley, who is from Tahlequah, Okla., entered Game 1 of the National League Division Series between St. Louis and Atlanta. He told the Post-Dispatch that he didn\u2019t notice the noise as he entered the game, saying he was too focused on the moment. But he did see the foam tomahawks that were placed on SunTrust Park seats before Game 1. And after the game , he said, he took some time to research the background of the tomahawk chop.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that people have suggested that they should change it, and it\u2019s still the same thing,\u201d Helsley told the Post-Dispatch.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the Post-Dispatch, the Braves said in a statement that the franchise takes \u201cseriously\u201d Helsley\u2019s concerns and has \u201cworked to honor and respect the Native American community through the years.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur organization has sought to embrace all people and highlight the many cultures in Braves Country,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cWe will continue to evaluate how we activate elements of our brand, as well as the in-game experience, and look forward to a continued dialogue with those in the Native American community once the season comes to an end.\u201d\n\nHelsley also spoke with the Athletic about the chop, saying it \u201ckind of devalues our Cherokee heritage and the Native American history.\u201d\n\n\u201cUs as Cherokee native people went through a lot in this country, and to have your ancestors used as a mascot, it\u2019s more of a disappointment-type thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me mad or anything, it\u2019s just like a disrespect-type thing. It shows less respect for the people, you know?\u201d\n\nIn February, Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred told The Washington Post that the Braves had \u201ctaken steps to take out the tomahawk chop.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that,\u201d Manfred said.\n\nHelsley faced two batters Thursday, allowing a single to Adam Duvall and forcing a groundout of Francisco Cervelli. The 25-year-old rookie did not play in Game 2 on Friday, which the Braves won.\n\n\u201cI feel like there are a lot of other things they could use as mascots,\u201d Helsley said. \u201cUsing our heritage as a mascot \u2014 it isn\u2019t the best thing. There have been schools who in the past 20, 30 years have changed their mascots. I don\u2019t see why professional teams are so far behind on that.\u201d\n\nHelsley still gives back to his community, working on math, reading comprehension and writing in English with local third- and fourth-grade students at a Cherokee immersion school.\n\nAD\n\nCardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley works full-time at the Cherokee immersion school in his hometown of Tahlequah, OK, in the off-season. Here is why it\u2019s important to him: https://t.co/1SlpVRoBSa \u2014 Mark Saxon (@markasaxon) August 29, 2019\n\n\u201cA lot of Cherokee kids are looking up to me right now. I understand that,\u201d he told the Peoria Journal Star in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m proud of my heritage, happy to be a role model, to let them see that it can be done. It means a lot.\u201d\n\nRead more on baseball:\n\nIn the Year of the Home Run, the Cardinals-Braves NLDS opener is a game of inches\n\nOrioles players thank fans with handwritten notes after another brutal season\n\nDavid Ortiz to rejoin Fox MLB broadcast four months after being shot\n\nAD", "description": "Reliever Ryan Helsley, a member of Cherokee Nation, took notice of the chant and foam tomahawks before pitching in the eighth inning of Game 1 of the National League Division Series between the Cardinals and Braves.", "authors": ["Jake Russell", "Sports News Aide", "Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sz-PB3mTB0BY8y4obcW8cY86sLw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VPKE4NWUHMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
