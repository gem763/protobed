One teenager died on the scene; the other two died later at a local hospital. The teens have not been officially identified.\n\n\u201cIt was five shots and then it sounded like a handgun,\u201d neighbor Carlos Watson told Atlanta\u2019s WSB-TV. \u201cThen I heard somebody have an assault rifle. And it was a slew of shots that came out.\u201d\n\nOther neighbors who overheard the altercation told the station the man who returned fire lives in the home and is protective of his mother, who was at the home at the time.\n\n\u201cIt could be a \u2018stand your ground\u2019 type case, based on the preliminary [information] that we have learned so far,\u201d Sheriff Eric Levett said at a press conference Tuesday. Levett cautioned that it\u2019s still \u201cvery early\u201d in the investigation.\n\nGeorgia enacted a \u201cstand your ground\u201d law in 2006. It permits the use of deadly force in self-defense if someone believes their own life is at risk.\n\nAt least 24 other states have similar versions of the law, 10 of which, including Georgia, explicitly state that an individual may \u201cstand his or her ground.\u201d That\u2019s according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan legislative organization.\n\nThe laws have come under scrutiny after George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, in Florida in 2012. Even though lawyers representing Zimmerman didn\u2019t invoke Florida\u2019s \u201cstand your ground\u201d law in his defense, a juror told CNN at the time it did influence their decision to return a verdict of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d", "description": "The Rockdale County Sheriff's office says it may be a \"stand your ground\" case.", "authors": ["National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8264893b00002efad6b23d.jpeg?cache=n6xzzck4dm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
