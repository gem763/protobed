Per HuffPost, the anonymous woman claims the director assaulted her in a hotel room after a business meeting in New York, where the duo discussed ideas for an in-development television project. At some point during this 2015 meeting, the woman alleges, she lost consciousness after being cajoled into drinking alcohol by Cohen, and woke up naked in his hotel room, where Cohen was sexually assaulting her. When she began to regain consciousness, she jolted out of bed, threw up in the bathroom, and returned to the bed while still \u201cfuzzy\u201d in the head, where Cohen attempted to assault her again. She eventually managed to leave later in the evening.\n\nAbout two years after the incident, the woman, triggered by the numerous Harvey Weinstein accusations, decided to text Cohen and confront him about that evening. \u201cThe night we met, you really hurt me and fucked me up,\u201d she wrote, to which Cohen responded, \u201cSo sorry to hear this.\u201d Cohen called her the next day, and allegedly apologized for \u201ccausing her pain.\u201d\n\nHuffPost confirmed through medical records that the woman immediately sought treatment for sexual assault after her incident with Cohen, and that she confided in two people about the alleged assault. A lawyer for Cohen likened the women\u2019s claims to \u201can outrageous defamatory hit piece,\u201d which is \u201cvehemently disputed and denied by my client.\u201d", "description": "The Fast and the Furious director Rob Cohen has been accused of sexual assault by a young woman who claims to have been unconscious during the ordeal.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/28/28-rob.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
