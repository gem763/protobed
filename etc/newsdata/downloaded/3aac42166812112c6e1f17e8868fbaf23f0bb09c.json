Can it survive today\u2019s politics?", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nCountry radio personality Bobby Bones and his pro dance partner, Sharna Burgess, celebrate with hosts Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews after winning Season 27 of \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d last year. (Eric McCandless/ABC)\n\nThe New York Post could barely contain its glee. \u201c \u2018DANCING\u2019 FOOLS \u2014 LAME HAS-BEENS HAVING A BALLROOM,\u201d the headline chortled atop a June 2005 takedown of a new reality series called \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201d\n\n\u201cABC must have gone to the well, or maybe that\u2019s the cesspool, and dredged up some of the lowest level \u2018celebrities\u2019 available in the country today for this competition show,\u201d critic Linda Stasi snarked of the premiere, starring \u201cBachelorette\u201d Trista Sutter, boxing champion Evander Holyfield and New Kids on the Block veteran Joey McIntyre.\n\nOne day later, the Post had to run another headline: \u201c \u2018DANCING\u2019 IS A SWINGING SUCCESS.\u201d The series premiere had earned a whopping 13.5 million viewers \u2014 the highest-rated summer debut since the groundbreaking \u201cSurvivor\u201d five years earlier.\n\nIt was far from the last time that someone mocked \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d for being exactly what it is \u2014 a hokey ballroom dance contest that its own executive producer describes as \u201cslightly crazy\u201d \u2014 only to later acknowledge its oddly enduring appeal. Launched as a six-episode adaptation of the British hit \u201cStrictly Come Dancing,\u201d the show quickly morphed into one of the biggest cultural forces on television \u2014 a fame-boosting platform for distantly remembered celebrities and a redemption tool for tarnished public figures.\n\nFourteen years later, \u201cDancing\u201d isn\u2019t the ratings giant it once was \u2014 last season averaged 8.6 million viewers, barely squeaking into the Top 35 most-watched TV shows. But it can still hijack the water cooler. An outright furor erupted when Sean Spicer \u2014 formerly President Trump\u2019s falsehood-prone press secretary \u2014 was announced as a cast member for Season 28, which premieres Monday. And here\u2019s the irony that tells you everything about \u201cDancing\u201d: The scandal wasn\u2019t that a former White House official was selling himself out for a cheesy reality show. It was that the show had decided to sprinkle its image-bolstering magic on him.\n\nSome fans of the show \u2014 well aware that its inspirational storylines and gentle edits have helped humanize contentious personalities from Kate Gosselin to Rick Perry \u2014 complained loudly, as did high-profile ABC personnel. \u201cI deeply abhor this decision by the company I work for and truly love,\u201d tweeted \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d showrunner Krista Vernoff. Even the show\u2019s affable host, Tom Bergeron, released a statement suggesting he was disappointed by a choice as political as Spicer, who will compete against \u201cQueer Eye\u201d co-host Karamo Brown, former NFL linebacker Ray Lewis and country singer Lauren Alaina, among others.\n\n\u201cDancing\u201d executive producer Andrew Llinares says he has no fear of politicizing the competition. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about having a show that creates a space where people from different backgrounds and different walks of life can come together in a really fun competition,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the focus.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe cast of \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d Season 28 (including Sean Spicer, Ray Lewis, Lauren Alaina, Christie Brinkley, Kate Flannery and Kel Mitchell) appear on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d (Lou Rocco/Walt Disney Television)\n\nThe successful formula behind \"Dancing With the Stars,\" which has aired in more than 50 countries, is to capture as many audience demographics as possible by mirroring those demographics in the cast. The ideal, producers say, is to craft a season that three generations of a family can watch together, and each member of the family will be excited by at least one competitor \u2014 whether it's Bristol Palin, Rick Fox or Florence Henderson, to name three of Season 11's mixed bag.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201ccreating the best dinner party possible, where you have 12 different people . . . that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily ever think of together,\u201d said longtime casting director Deena Katz. \u201cYou want some of those people who are in the zeitgeist, but you want some of those people that were touchstones that you remember from your favorite sitcom.\u201d\n\nInitially, some celebrities hesitated to be seen dancing the Viennese waltz on live TV in a bedazzled costume and aggressive spray tan. On the series premiere, a seizure-inducing kaleidoscope of sparkly purple, orange and blue graphics welcomed the audience before Bergeron introduced what he called \u201ca competition like you have never seen before: Tonight, we\u2019ve got six stars, six professional dancers and two pivotal words \u2014 ballroom dancing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore that scares you off, let\u2019s meet our competitors!\u201d co-host Lisa Canning chimed in.\n\nIndeed, the ABC executives who were so eager to find their own \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d were nonetheless skittish about how viewers would react to ballroom dancing. It turned out they were captivated \u2014 not just by the spectacle of amateurs competing in dance but also the grueling physicality of the rehearsal scenes, the personal story arcs of battling demons or overcoming challenges, and the unapologetic escapism of a two-hour block of television in which the biggest crisis might involve nailing the footwork for the cha-cha.\n\nAbout 22 million people tuned in to the Season 1 finale. When a debate raged over whether soap star Kelly Monaco really deserved to win over \u201cSeinfeld\u201d supporting player John O\u2019Hurley, producers mounted a rematch two months later, and nearly 11 million viewers watched. The network moved the show to the middle of the regular season.\n\n\u201cIt was scary to suddenly start playing with the big kids,\u201d Katz said. But \u201cDancing\u201d was ready. About 27 million viewers saw pop singer Drew Lachey triumph over retired Super Bowl champion Jerry Rice in the second season finale. \u201cWe were all like, \u2018Holy cow \u2014 this wasn\u2019t a one-hit wonder.\u2019 \u201d\n\nKatz\u2019s phone soon started ringing with stars eager to join. Actress Lisa Rinna, whom Katz said at first \u201cwas a little afraid\u201d when she was asked to do Season 2, ended up so pleased that she enlisted her husband, former \u201cL.A. Law\u201d star Harry Hamlin, for Season 3. Agents told Katz that the show had become a coveted stop for clients during TV pilot season because the relentless tabloid attention \u2014 especially for supposed romances between pro dancers and their partners \u2014 could put a faded star back on Hollywood\u2019s radar.\n\nQuentin Tarantino rediscovered Cloris Leachman during Season 7 and offered her a role in \u201cInglourious Basterds.\u201d Kirstie Alley took second-place honors in Season 12 and shortly after landed a new sitcom. Alfonso Ribeiro, previously best known from the \u201990s sitcom \u201cFresh Prince of Bel-Air,\u201d broke out as the winner of Season 19 to find a lucrative new relationship with ABC hosting \u201cAmerica\u2019s Funniest Home Videos.\u201d\n\nCountry music radio personality Bobby Bones, who won Season 27, calls the show \u201cthe most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life.\u201d He had zero dance experience but thinks that helped viewers connect to his journey.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real boldness to doing something you\u2019re bad at,\u201d said Bones, who gained about 250,000 Instagram followers on his path to victory. \u201cThe exposure was a big deal, but for me, exposure was maybe secondary to the fact that it was something new for me to try.\u201d\n\nRadio host Adam Carolla told Katz that he joined the sixth season because the offer scared him and that\u2019s how he knew he had to do it. And the winning celebrities take tremendous pride in hoisting the garish Mirror Ball Trophy.\n\n\u201cNone of these people need us in their real lives \u2014 they all have careers, they\u2019re not going to be ballroom dancers when this is over,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThere\u2019s something really charming about how much they care really just for this Mirror Ball.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d debuted in June 2005 and shocked some in the industry when it debuted to 13.5 million viewers. (Eric McCandless/ABC)\n\nOf course, for some participants, the stakes are higher: They've come looking for redemption. And it's no secret that, unless you have some truly self-sabotaging tendencies, it's almost impossible to get a bad edit on \"Dancing With the Stars.\"\n\n\u201cThey are able to ensure that you may look slightly silly, but you\u2019ll never really humiliate yourself. It\u2019s a Nerf environment,\u201d Fox News host Tucker Carlson, an early Season 3 evictee, told Slate in 2016. Slate\u2019s Laura Bennett pronounced the show \u201cour culture\u2019s foremost celebrity image rehabilitation machine, the easiest way for stars to rise from the ashes when they have something they want the public to forget.\u201d\n\nThe \u201credemption\u201d slot is a treasured one on \u201cDancing,\u201d for personalities hoping to win America\u2019s forgiveness by showing their more sensitive and relatable sides \u2014 Paula Deen, after she was sued for racial discrimination; Ryan Lochte, after he was accused of fabricating a claim of being robbed at the Rio Olympics; former congressman Tom DeLay, after he was indicted on charges from a campaign finance investigation. Hope Solo, Mischa Barton and Jerry Springer also danced to improve troubled reputations.\n\nEven contestants who aren\u2019t fleeing a scandal have seen their images shined up by the show. MJ Santilli, who runs the reality competition website Mjsbigblog, points to Kelly Osbourne, daughter of Ozzy and Sharon, best known for her stint on MTV\u2019s \u201cThe Osbournes,\u201d who placed third in Season 9 after a foot injury. Once dismissed as a reality-TV has-been, \u201cher stint on the show gave her a sheen of being a survivor, a strong person, someone who persevered,\u201d Santilli said. \u201cThe show can do that, and I think a lot of stars hope for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDancing\u201d rarely fixates on the negative. The celebrity gets to choose exactly how much they want to share in the prerecorded scenes, and the producers are willing to focus on more ingratiating storylines, such as recovering from an injury, in the case of DeLay, or a recent weight loss, in the case of Deen.\n\nAfter all, the producers say, the point is to serve up two hours of pure entertainment \u2014 although it\u2019s hard to imagine viewers feeling like they have escaped from the real world if they see someone like Sean Spicer back on their TV screens. For all the troublesome personalities the show has taken on, Spicer is the most politically polarizing thus far \u2014 a choice that, in our ever more fractious climate, could put \u201cDancing\u2019s\u201d giddy, goofy buoyancy to the test.\n\nBut if executives have any qualms, they\u2019re not letting it show.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the show has been on for 27 seasons, it must be doing something right,\u201d Llinares said. \u201cOur job as TV producers is to make the audience feel something, and I think this is a show that makes people feel joy.\u201d", "description": "Once a punchline, it became a surefire vehicle for fame boosting and image repair.
