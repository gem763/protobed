'Just Not Right'\n\n''This shouldn't be allowed to happen,'' said Mrs. Whitehead, who was paid $10,000 in 1986 by a New Jersey couple, William and Elizabeth Stern, to bear Mr. Stern's child. ''Don't let it happen to anybody else. It's just not right.''\n\nThe coalition opposing surrogacy was organized by Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, a small public policy group in Washington that has influenced the national debate on developments in biotechnology. Mr. Rifkin said today that more surrogate mothers are bringing legal action to gain custody of their children.", "description": "", "authors": ["Keith Schneider", "Special To The New York Times"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "published_at": "1987-09-01"}
