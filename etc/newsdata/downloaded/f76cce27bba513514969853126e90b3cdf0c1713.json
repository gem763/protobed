Photo: Courtesy of Neon/Hulu\n\nRarely have I seen a horror-comedy as joyless as Little Monsters. Which feels like a weird (and sad) thing to say, because rarely have I seen a horror-comedy that is also so insistent in its humor, so determined to try and entertain me, as Little Monsters. It\u2019s fast, loud, and impossibly shrill \u2014 except when it quiets down, which is when it briefly, belatedly comes to life.\n\nThe loudness and shrillness begin early, with the film\u2019s opening montage of a viciously bickering Australian couple, has-been rocker Dave (Alexander England) and real-estate agent Sara (Nadia Townsend), as they scream at each other in a variety of settings \u2014 at the store, at home, in the car, at a restaurant among friends. Soon enough, loser Dave has moved in with his sister Tess (Kat Stewart) and her 5-year-old, Felix (Diesel La Torraca), but he continues to cause havoc at her home \u2014 arguing over the food, wasting time on the couch with his VR video games, and yelling all sorts of absurd profanities in the child\u2019s presence.\n\nThe sustained blast of unpleasantness with which Little Monsters kicks off might have been bracing had there been any wit or humor to Dave\u2019s selfish, simple-minded jagoffery. Or even some humanity. We know of course that Dave will eventually learn his lesson and become a better man \u2014 because this is a movie, and he is its lead \u2014 but England and writer-director Abe Forsythe give him no sense of inner life, no hint of charm or charisma. He\u2019s a profoundly uninteresting character, and by the time he decides to accompany Felix and his school chums on a field trip to a petting zoo in an effort to woo their cute teacher Miss Caroline (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), I had already checked out on whatever else this obnoxious dillweed might do. Then came Teddy McGiggles (Josh Gad), an aggressively annoying, alcoholic children\u2019s-TV personality, because apparently the film wasn\u2019t already irritating enough.\n\nHave I mentioned that this is a zombie movie?\n\nWell, it\u2019s a zombie movie. There\u2019s an American military base nearby, and a test has gone wrong, so soon zombies are invading the petting zoo, and Dave and Miss Caroline and Teddy McGiggles and the kids hole up at a gift shop. The undead slowly roam the grounds, pressing up against windows, munching on arms, and generally looking ridiculous. Forsythe attempts to mine so much familiar humor with these overexposed monsters that I can\u2019t decide if he\u2019s never seen other zombie comedies like Shaun of the Dead, or if he\u2019s only seen other zombie comedies like Shaun of the Dead.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, the movie grows a soul. Or maybe it was already there, but I couldn\u2019t see it through the distracting haze of the characters\u2019 noxious buffoonery. Amid the grotesque gore and profanity, Miss Caroline, armed with a ukulele and her bright demeanor, tries to keep the kids calm and safe and happy, cheerfully singing songs and playing games and speaking to them quietly. Nyong\u2019o brings both grace and effervescence to the part, which makes for a welcome, pointed contrast to the insanity that surrounds her. Her scenes with the children are so effective that they become something more \u2014 a resonant metaphor for our need (be it as parents, teachers, or just plain human beings) to persevere and preserve some semblance of innocence in a world gone haywire.\n\nThat was probably the idea all along, and perhaps speaks to why so much of the rest of the film feels so manic, so unhinged and hostile \u2014 the better to highlight the oasis of kindness and goodness that Miss Caroline represents. Theoretically, it\u2019s the right idea: to create a formal tension to echo the narrative one. But theory only gets you so far if you botch the execution.
