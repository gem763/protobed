In AR the cards spring to life allowing you to hear their isiZulu pronunciation.\n\nLambani spent 10 years in the South African film industry before moving into researching new media technology development for a Masters degree.\n\n\u201cAmbani was sparked by my personal experience and Master's research around South Africa's Model C [schools] and the first black cohort in the country to grow up detached from their ethnic languages and cultures, through being educated in previously white schools and moving into white neighbourhoods,\u201d she said.\n\nLambani wants to make learning African languages fun, especially for families who feel they may have become disconnected from their traditional heritage.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa's Education System has many challenges: African-language speaking children have to drop their mother tongue or home language too soon, and learn in a language they do not understand. It is very difficult to learn a foreign language well enough to learn through it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe company ultimately want to gamify other aspects of learning such as science, math, art and critical thinking subjects. She wants to make education a more whole, independent and accessible experience for young African learners.\n\n\u201cOver 50% of Grade 4 learners in South Africa do not understand what they read. A scarcity of books written in African languages, as well as a shortage of well-resourced school and community libraries.\u201d\n\nThe APP is currently only in isiZulu. But, Lambani plans to introduce Kiswahili, Setswana, Tshivenda, Igbo, Shona over the next few weeks.\n\nThe cards sell for R60, and can be bought online on the Ambani website. The Ambani Africa app is available on both IOS and Android for free.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "Mukundi Lambani wants to make learning African languages fun.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9212/a1edd13d112d4193990c68c360cf719d.png", "published_at": "2019-08-10"}
