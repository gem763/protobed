And they\u2019re still coming out, with a new one provided Wednesday by head coach Doc Rivers.\n\nThe time Sterling tried to screw over JJ Redick\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRivers regaled a remarkable if not-so-shocking tale to the Los Angeles\u2019 Times Arash Markazi about the time he told Sterling he quit after the then-Clippers owner decided to back out on a deal with shooting guard JJ Redick.\n\nThe year was 2013. Rivers was six days on the job. And the Clippers had just completed a sign-and-trade for Redick from the Milwaukee Bucks with a verbal agreement to pay him $27 million over four years.\n\nDoc Rivers says he came close to never coaching a game for the Clippers. (Getty)\n\n\u201cI was on the job for six days and I quit,\u201d Rivers told Markazi. \u201cThe deal went through and everyone said it was a great deal. I flew back home to Orlando for a couple of days and I got a call from [former Clippers president] Andy Roeser saying Donald Sterling decided he didn\u2019t want to do the deal. I said, \u2018What do you mean? The deal is already done. JJ is a free agent. He backed out of a deal to sign with us. If we don\u2019t do this deal we\u2019ll never get another free agent. It\u2019s our word.\u2019\u201d\n\nRedick had turned down other offers that were no longer available, and Rivers was furious with Sterling for the stunning breach of integrity.\n\n\u201cI was in the airport parking lot screaming, \u2018No, no, no, no! You\u2019re not going to do this!\u201d Rivers told Markazi. \u201c\u2018This is my reputation!\u2019 He just went on and on about his reputation and how great it was.\u201d\n\nThings worked out for Doc\n\nStory continues\n\nSterling, of course, eventually relented, according to Rivers, as Redick went on to play four seasons with the Clippers.\n\nThe whole story is worth a read if only for a laugh at Sterling\u2019s notorious incompetence.\n\nNow Sterling is gone and Rivers is still in L.A. coaching a championship-caliber roster.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Donald Sterling was a lot of things as Clippers owner.
