Bullying is a nationwide problem.\"\n\nTwo 13-year-old boys have been arrested and charged with voluntary manslaughter, it is reported.\n\nIn a statement the Moreno Valley Sheriff's Office said: \"The Riverside County Sheriff\u2019s Department is saddened to share the 13-year-old victim from Landmark Middle School was pronounced clinically dead last night as a result of injuries sustained in the attack on Monday, September 16, 2019.\n\n\"Rigorous medical intervention and treatment efforts at an area hospital were unsuccessful.\"", "description": "Diego Stolz had his life support taken off nine days after he was brutally assaulted by two teenage boys at the Landmark Middle School in California", "authors": ["Tiffany Lo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20226345.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Diego3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
