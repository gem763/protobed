Issues mentioned in the letter include Apple's \"restrictions on third-party repairs\" of its devices, the App Store algorithm for search result rankings, and Apple's policies on permitting apps to use payment systems other than Apple Pay.\n\nA New York Times analysis this week found that App Store rankings disproportionately promoted Apple's own apps, shunting competitors' apps further down in search results. Apple denied that this was intentional, arguing that its apps appeared higher in search simply because they were more popular.\n\nThe letter sent by the congressional probe Friday is the latest development in the committee's bipartisan antitrust investigation into tech giants announced in June. As part of the same inquiry, the committee also sent similar letters to Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet on Friday requesting information on how the companies dominate online advertising.\n\nApple has long held tight control over the market for repairs on its own devices, but has recently taken steps to loosen those restrictions. Last month, it began selling iPhone parts to some independent repair companies \u2014 but, importantly, it still does not sell parts directly to customers.\n\nTech giants are facing increasing scrutiny, even as the congressional probe ramps up. Earlier this week, 50 state attorneys general announced a joint investigation into the control Facebook and Google hold over search and digital advertising.\n\n\"Today's document requests are an important milestone in this investigation as we work to obtain the information that our Members need to make this determination,\" House Judiciary Antitrust Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., told Politico on Friday.", "description": "Congress is investigating whether Apple's restrictions on third-party repairs constitutes a violation of antitrust law", "authors": ["Aaron Holmes"], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
