The spokesperson did not elaborate.\n\nCBP also said that \u201cattempts were made to return the individuals to Canada, however, Canada refused to allow their return.\u201d\n\nThis much, at least, is clear: David and Eileen Connors were kept in custody along with their family for more than week after being detained at the Canadian border in early October. It appears they remained in custody as of Wednesday pending their deportation to the U.K.\n\n\u201cWe will never forget, we will be traumatized for the rest of our lives by what the United States government has done to us. We have been treated like criminals here, stripped of our rights, and lied to,\u201d Eileen, 24, wrote in a sworn statement made available to reporters by her legal advocates, according to the Washington Post.\n\n(The family\u2019s account is based on their statement and information from their lawyer as reported by the Post, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and Philadelphia Inquirer.)\n\nAccording to a local immigration law clinic and the family\u2019s lawyer, who reportedly briefed the press on Monday and provided their statement, the family was vacationing in Canada on Oct. 3 \u2014 a day later than the illegal border crossing described by the government \u2014 when they inadvertently drove over the boundary between the U.S. and Canada in order to avoid an animal in the road.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what kind of animal may have spooked them.\n\nArrests at the Canadian border, even if the crossings are incidental to something as benign as a routine jog, are not unheard of, the Post notes. Last year more than 4,000 people were arrested at the northern border, according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cThey had no idea they had crossed any boundary,\u201d attorney Bridget Cambria told reporters on a conference call. \u201cThey had no idea they were even in the United States. They were just trying to get back to their hotel.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou crossed an international border,\u201d Eileen Connors said in her statement that her family was told.\n\n\u201cWe asked if we couldn\u2019t simply turn around and the officer said no,\u201d Eileen said. \u201cWe kept repeating we did not want to be here. We were detained anyway and treated in a way that no human deserves to be treated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware of no rhyme or reason for how this family was treated \u2014 no history of things untoward,\u201d Cambria, their attorney, told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of no negative or derogatory information at all; this was couple that was on a family vacation with their young child.\u201d\n\nEileen said that while they were almost immediately taken into custody, the Connorses were not read their rights or given the opportunity to contact their embassy, while later contact with the embassy was met with interference.\n\nNot exactly, according to U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, who took custody of the family on Oct. 3 after their arrest by CBP: ICE officials said they \u201censured the Connors had access to \u2026 consular officials while in ICE custody.\u201d\n\nAt the time of their arrest, Eileen and 30-year-old her husband, David, were with their 3-month-old, a boy, along with David\u2019s brother Michael Connors and Michael\u2019s 2-year-old twins.\n\nThe Connors family detailed wretched conditions for their detainment, including their longest stay at a Pennsylvania family facility, echoing numerous other stories about the degrading and harsh treatment of people being held in the immigration system.\n\nICE, however, stridently denied the Connors account of their time at the Pennsylvania facility, which has been criticized before. Nonetheless, ICE officials said in a statement: \u201cReports of abuse or inhumane conditions \u2026 are unequivocally false.\u201d", "description": "Government Disputes U.K. Family\u2019s Border Arrest Story", "authors": ["Adam Carlson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/P3tEij2.VbpZcgfnPIl2jw--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/3120caba5ce9bdd57828da586ae19002", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
