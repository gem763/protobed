That's a record", "language": "en", "text": "New York (CNN Business) After one of its cars made a high-speed run on a German test track, Bugatti says it is the first production auto manufacturer to make a car that exceeded 300 miles per hour.\n\nVolkswagen Group VLKPF A specially modified Bugatti Chiron, driven by Bugatti test driver Andy Wallace, went 304.8 miles per hour on a 5.5 mile straightaway on Volkswagen's Ehra-Lessien test track in Germany, the company said. Bugatti is owned by the, which also owns Lamborghini and Bentley.\n\nBugatti worked with the race car manufacturer Dallara to create a special version of the Chiron.\n\nBugatti is a \"production auto manufacturer,\" meaning it makes multiple copies of the same car for use on public roads albeit, in Bugatti's case, in low numbers and at very high prices. But this was not the ordinary sort of Chiron one can buy for $3 million from the Bugatti factory in Molsheim, France . This record was set by a prototype Chiron that Bugatti developed in cooperation with the Italian race car manufacturer Dallara. (Cars built solely to compete for speed records have gone as fast as over 500 miles per hour.)\n\nIn addition to making safety alterations for such high speeds, the companies modified the car's body to improve aerodynamics. The tires were also specially developed by Michelin, which makes the tires for regular Chiron cars as well. The tires are still legal for road use but they were reinforced to withstand these extremely high speeds.\n\nChanges were made to the car's body to improve its aerodynamcs for very high speeds.\n\n\"It's inconceivable that a car would be capable of this. But the Chiron was well prepared and I felt very safe \u2014 even in these high speed ranges,\" Wallace said in a statement.\n\nRead More", "description": "Bugatti became the first production car manufacturer to have a car go over 300 mph with a specially modified Chiron.", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190902112151-01-bugatti-300-mph-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-02"}
