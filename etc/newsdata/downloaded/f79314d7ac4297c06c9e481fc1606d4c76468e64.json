Three days later, women\u2019s site Refinery29 spread the message with its story, \u201cMen On How Abortion Changed Their Lives.\u201d\n\nThe media message seemed simple: men should talk about abortion, and they should talk about it positively.\n\nIn the GQ and Glamour piece, 12 men shared \u201chow the procedure has impacted their lives.\u201d But only one challenged abortion as a pro-life man.\n\n\u201cEven as male lawmakers dominate the debate around women\u2019s reproductive health at the highest levels,\u201d the story\u2019s subtitle read, \u201cpublic conversations about the very real experiences men have had with abortion remain rare.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because, magazine writer Rebecca Nelson argued, \u201cThere is a line of thinking that suggests that since it isn't their body on the line, men should remain quiet.\u201d (It\u2019s a line of thinking spread by her own industry, she might add.)\n\nShe pointed to the pro-life movement in comparison: \u201cMen are an active presence in the anti-abortion-rights camp, leading some major pro-life organizations and marching proudly in demonstrations.\u201d\n\nBut those were not the men she sought out for her story. Instead, she turned to abortion-friendly organizations.\n\n\u201cI found men through local abortion-rights chapters, online message boards, and organizations like We Testify and Shout Your Abortion,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe men varied widely in age, location, socioeconomic class, race, and ethnicity.\u201d\n\nBut they didn\u2019t vary in their ideologies. While some of the men felt torn about abortion and wondered about fatherhood, just one said he didn\u2019t support the abortion of his child.\n\nDiego, a 27-year-old New Yorker, revealed that he found out his girlfriend had an abortion \u2013 after the fact.\n\n\u201c[O]ne night she just came out and said, \u2018Hey, I had an abortion this week,\u2019\u201d he remembered. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Wait, what?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cShe thought that I just wouldn\u2019t want to deal with it, which was not the case at all. I was pretty devastated,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I was just thinking, like, Oh my God. I lost my child.\u201d\n\nAs a Christian, he said the experience strengthened his pro-life stance.\n\n\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve become more knowledgeable and active in why I believe abortion is wrong, as far as what the Bible says, the arguments for pro-life and for pro-choice, and how we talk about the issue,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, that wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hurt that that baby never had a chance. I\u2019m hurt that my girlfriend thought that was the right decision to make, especially without consulting with me,\u201d he urged. \u201cBecause even though America says this is a women\u2019s issue, it\u2019s as much a man\u2019s issue because it takes a man and a woman to make a baby.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cI think about that baby\u2014not, like, every day or every week\u2014but I think about that baby a lot.\u201d\n\nIn Refinery29\u2019s piece, writer Zoe Beaty spoke with four men \u2013 none of whom expressed regret or remorse. Instead, as one man named Jon said, abortion allowed him and his former girlfriend to \u201cmove forward with our lives in a positive way and have children when we were both ready \u2013 financially, emotionally \u2013 and in the right relationship.\u201d\n\nAlso chiming in, Amelia Bonow, an abortion supporter and the head of Shout Your Abortion, tweeted on October 21 that \u201cMen need to start speaking up about how their lives have been positively impacted by abortion.\u201d Positively, and only positively.\n\nShe shared a video that her organization made, in collaboration with The Cut and Weird Dog Production. More than a half dozen men appeared in the video titled \u201cAbortion Is for Everyone.\u201d None of them identified as pro-life or against abortion.\n\nBut those men exist.\n\nPro-life group Silent No More Awareness Campaign compiles thousands of testimonies from women and men expressing remorse and regret from abortion. Those include stories from fathers.\n\nOne of them, named Scott, wrote, \u201cI started drinking deliberately rather than casually at this time, hoping the awareness of the life we had conceived would disappear like the pregnancy had. But it did not. It never went away.\"\n\nAnother man, Paul, wrote a message to his child.\n\n\u201cThis year would have been your 25th birthday. I apologize and ask for your forgiveness for the \u2018would have been\u2019 in that statement,\u201d he urged. \u201cI know you have forgiven me, and I know you are in the presence of Jesus, who has also forgiven me. I ask for strength from Jesus to find a way to forgive myself.\u201d\n\nA man named Chuck wrote, \"I would give up anything to have that choice back; to have had the courage to say, \u2018No.\u2019 Instead, I said nothing.\"\n\nThe media are right: Both men and women should speak up about abortion. But in delivering that message, they have a responsibility to listen to the voices that are different from their own, rather than silencing them.", "description": "Many in the media are pushing men to talk about .10/25/2019 12:02:39PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Yoder", "Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/191/2375cacd-4c1a-49a6-8f5d-81a64a186d1a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
