Signed for \u00a31.5 million as a 19-year-old, in 2016, after just 12 appearances for Sheffield United, he has been a more effective player for England\u2019s Under-20s and 21s than he has for his club.\n\nThere is talent there, but he managed just eight goals for Everton last term and has failed to convince he lead the line for a club that is still searching for an effective replacement for Romelu Lukaku, two years on from his departure to Manchester United.\n\nStill just 22, this was a timely reminder of what Calvert-Lewin, who attended the Forge Valley School five minutes\u2019 drive from Hillsborough, can do\n\n\u201cDominic was the striker who has started more time on the pitch with me this season,\u201d said a relieved Everton manager Marco Silva. \u201cIt was important for him to score twice and in the important part of the game, three goals in his last games is good for his confidence. Let\u2019s hope he can continue this way.\u201d\n\nThe first finish was emphatic, taking down Djibril Sidibe\u2019s cross field pass with a delicate touch, he steadied himself and thumped a ferocious shot past Wednesday goalkeeper Cameron Dawson.\n\nCalvert-Lewin grabbed his second moments later. Bernard and Alex Iwobi combined down the left, with the latter pulling the ball back across goal, where Everton\u2019s number 9 stretched out a leg to convert.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday tried to make a game of it and Sam Winnall, who also failed to beat Jordan Pickford one-on-one in the first half, put a free header over the bar from a free kick, but Everton were comfortable.\n\nMatch details\n\nSheffield Wednesday (4-4-2): Dawson 7; Odubajo 7, Iorfa 6, Thorniley 6, Fox 6; Reach 6, Luongo 5, Pelupessy 6, Murphy 4 (Harris 59), Winnall 4 (Rhodes 64), Nuhiu 5 (Fletcher 70)\n\nSubs not used: Jones, Palmer, Lee, FBannan\n\n\n\nEverton (4-2-3-1): Pickford 6; Holgate 6, Mina 7, Sidibe 7, Digne 6; Delph 7 (Schneiderlin 90+1), Davies 7; Richarlison 5 (Walcott 67), Iwobi 7, Bernard 7 (Sigurdsson 76); Calvert-Lewin 8\n\nSubs not used: Lossl, Keane, Coleman, Kean.\n\nBooked: Delph\n\n\n\n\n\nReferee: Jeremy Simpson\n\nAttendance: 21,485\n\n", "description": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin grew up just over a mile away from Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s home ground but has always been a Blade and sliced the Championship club apart on his return to his home city.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fyYdvMu8fNIGlOXEfEoOsw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDIuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wtnCxMQWdybz5F4YcyieNA--~B/aD0xNTY1O3c9MjQ5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/6a82fbface7e7e82d2066e98a372389c", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
