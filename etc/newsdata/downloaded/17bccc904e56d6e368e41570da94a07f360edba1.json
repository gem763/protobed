The IBM z15 mainframe has \u201cunprecedented encryption, unprecedented security and privacy,\u201d he added.\n\nWithin the IBM z15 processor chip, there are 15.6 miles of wires, 9.2 billion transistors and 26.2 billion wiring connections \u2014 all of which allow a single z15 server to process 1 trillion web transactions per day and have a \u201c25% better performance\u201d than the z14 mainframe.\n\nIn all, IBM Z mainframes support 87% of all credit card transactions and nearly $8 trillion payments a year, in addition to 29 billion ATM transactions each year, worth nearly $5 billion per day. As the number of credit card transactions globally continue to rise, Rosamilia says customers continue to buy capacity \u2013 and in \u201cthe last 10 years, we\u2019ve seen the inventory grow 3.5 times.\u201d\n\nThis also comes as data breaches continue to hit the online world, affecting companies like Equifax (EFX), Capitol One (COF), Sony (SNE) and Target(TGT). But, Rosamilia says, \u201cthe bad guys are going to get in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best thing you can do is encrypt 100% of your data, and if you encrypt 100% then when they get in, they can\u2019t make any sense of it,\u201d he said.\n\nIBM's new z15 mainframe can process 1 trillion web transactions per day. More\n\nData privacy and cloud capabilities\n\nPart of the ability to maintain privacy across the board in this new z15 mainframe is thanks to IBM\u2019s recent acquisition of Red Hat, which closed in July for $34 billion.\n\nRedHat allowed IBM to bring cloud-native app development to IBM Z including OpenShift.\n\n\u201cOpenShift really provides a layer of installation for clients,\u201d Rosamilia says. \u201cIf they choose to run today on premise, tomorrow on the IBM cloud and the next day they want to run on somebody else\u2019s cloud, we\u2019re in a hybrid multi-cloud world, so they\u2019re able to do deployments everywhere and they don\u2019t want to lock themselves into any platform.\u201d\n\nInstant recovery, encryption capabilities and cloud native developments certainly do come with a significant price tag. Each mainframe is custom built and costs anywhere from $250,000 to $4 million. IBM hopes to see a return in revenue in fiscal year 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to come out with it, demand will be what it is. I\u2019m optimistic based on our co-creation, but time will tell,\u201d Rosamilia says.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "IBM is out with its newest mainframe - z15.
