Circuit Court of Appeals mostly affirmed FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's 2017 rollback of the net neutrality rules, which required internet service providers to treat web traffic equally. The court also ordered the FCC to do more to address the rollback's affect on public safety and other issues.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe opinion is the latest development in a long-running battle over internet service regulations, and is unlikely to be the final word on the issue.\n\nThe coalition of tech companies, states and advocacy groups that challenged Pai's repeal could still seek to have the D.C. Circuit's full complement of judges rehear the case, or to bring it to the Supreme Court \u2014 or both. And the court turning back the FCC's attempt to override state net neutrality laws removes a major barrier for states like California and Washington that have already passed such measures. That could amount to a de facto restoration of the Obama-era rules in large swaths of the country.\n\nNevertheless, Pai was cheered by the decision, saying on Twitter, \"Today\u2019s D.C. Circuit decision is a big victory for consumers! The court affirmed the FCC's decision to repeal 1930s utility-style regulation of the Internet. A free and open Internet is what we have today. A free and open Internet is what we\u2019ll continue to have going forward.\"\n\nBacked by the biggest players in the cable and telecom industry, Pai has claimed that firm net-neutrality regulations chill investment and innovation in broadband. The parties challenging his repeal argued the rules are necessary to prevent broadband providers from slowing online traffic, blocking websites or creating paid fast lanes.\n\nPai led the agency\u2019s Republican majority in repealing the regulations in a December 2017 vote, over the objections of Democratic commissioners. Pai argued the rules, which applied regulations originally written for telephone companies to internet service providers, were overly burdensome and could open the door to more and more federal regulation of broadband.\n\nDuring oral arguments that spanned nearly five hours in February, appeals court judges Patricia Millett, Robert Wilkins and Stephen Williams grilled attorneys on both sides on a range of issues, including the legal and technical rationale behind the agency\u2019s decision to reclassify broadband as a lightly regulated information service. The Obama-era FCC had opted to treat it a telecommunications service, which allows for stricter oversight.\n\nIn addition to the reclassification issue, the judges also questioned the authority the FCC asserted to block states from crafting their own net neutrality protections, the repeal\u2019s potential impact on public safety communications and whether transparency requirements from the repeal order would be effective in preventing anticompetitive or consumer-harming behavior by ISPs. Those requirements hold that providers have to disclose if they engage in practices like blocking websites or slowing traffic.\n\nThe judges ultimately found challengers' arguments \"unconvincing for the most part,\" and upheld the vast majority of the order, including the reclassification. But they found the FCC lacked the authority to stop states from issuing their own net neutrality rules.\n\n\"No matter how desirous of protecting their policy judgments, agency officials cannot invest themselves with power that Congress has not conferred,\" the decision said.\n\nThe court also ordered the FCC to produce evidence that it's considered the repeal's impact on public safety, telecom companies' access to utility poles and the Lifeline program, which provides telecom subsidies for low-income people. Any agency proceeding meant to to prove that the repeal won't cause harm around those issues could trigger a further lengthy court battle.\n\nThe court noted the lengthy legal battle in explaining why it sent back several issues to the FCC to address, rather than vacating those portions of the order.\n\n\"Regulation of broadband internet has been the subject of protracted litigation, with broadband providers subjected to and then released from common carrier regulation over the previous decade,\" the opinion said. \"We decline to yet again flick the on-off switch of common-carrier regulation under these circumstances.\"\n\nChallengers to the FCC\u2019s repeal included Mozilla, which pushes for open-internet principles and runs the Firefox internet browser; consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge; tech trade association Incompas; and New York, California, Washington and other state and local governments.\n\nAndrew Schwartzman, who represented the Benton Institute for Broadband and Society in challenging the FCC, said the opinion provides a roadmap to creating rules that will protect consumers.\n\n\"Even on a quick reading, it is clear that the fight over net neutrality is just beginning,\" Schwartzman said in a statement. \"The FCC can try to fix its mistakes, but the court made it clear that the Commission cannot block states from passing their own net neutrality statutes and issuing executive orders. Those will have to be reviewed case by case.\"\n\nThe agency\u2019s repeal was supported by a slew of trade groups representing internet service providers, including USTelecom, NCTA \u2014 The Internet & Television Association, CTIA \u2014 The Wireless Association, American Cable Association, and Wireless Internet Service Providers Association.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit previously upheld the telecommunications classification and the Obama-era rules in 2016. But the FCC has a Supreme Court precedent from 2005 finding it's reasonable to classify internet connections as an information service.\n\nThe three judges wrote in individual opinions that they agreed on the broad strokes of the collective ruling, though Williams, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, broke with the other two on striking down the portion of the order that would preempt state net neutrality laws. He said the FCC was well within its rights to do so because it would be impossible to enforce differing state laws on the inherently interstate internet.", "description": "The judges ultimately found challengers' arguments \"unconvincing for the most part,\" and upheld the vast majority of the order.", "authors": ["Margaret Harding Mcgill"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/74/c1/bfa79e4b4373bcb97d964a379cb6/fcc-building.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
