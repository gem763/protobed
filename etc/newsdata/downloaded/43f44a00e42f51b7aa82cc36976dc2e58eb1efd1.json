And the impeachment showdown raises the stakes for a potential government shutdown in late November, when stopgap funding Trump is expected to sign this week runs out.\n\nThe confrontation between the president and the House majority promises to be consuming, leaving little bandwidth or appetite for cooperation on other matters. \u201cNot that there\u2019s a ton now, but there\u2019s going to be less,\u201d says Andy Laperriere, head of U.S. policy research for Cornerstone Macro. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to walk and chew gum when impeachment is one of those things. I don\u2019t think they can multitask impeachment and a legislative agenda.\u201d\n\nInvestors drew a similar conclusion. The S&P 500 saw its biggest one-day drop in a month, sliding 0.8 percent, as did the Nasdaq. And the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.5 percent after recovering some earlier losses. It was one of the most volatile trading day in weeks, as investors reacted to gyrations on the impeachment front while also absorbing gloomy news about consumer confidence and the U.S.-China trade war.\n\n\u201cInvestors like gridlock, but they don\u2019t like dysfunctional paralysis,\u201d Stephen Myrow of Beacon Policy Advisors tells me. And impeachment \u201cis raising the specter of dysfunctional paralysis,\u201d a dynamic that could doom the USMCA, for example, while presenting new risks, \u201cparticularly in the event of a crisis.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats haven\u2019t foreclosed on continuing their everyday work while the impeachment inquiry gets underway. Via the Financial Times\u2019s James Politi:\n\nA spokesperson for Richard Neal, House Ways and Means committee chair, says he is \"absolutely committed to continuing\" the USMCA talks, \"regardless of any other congressional activity\" \u2014 James Politi (@JamesPoliti) September 24, 2019\n\nBut White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham signaled the administration will no longer work with House Democrats on matters of common interest. \u201cIn a far departure from all of the work and results of this President, House Democrats have destroyed any chances of legislative progress for the people of this country by continuing to focus all their energy on partisan political attacks,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nTrump sent a similar message in a tweet:\n\nThe Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it, including legislation on gun safety, lowering of prescription drug prices, infrastructure, etc. So bad for our Country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nWashington analysts who help decode political developments for Wall Street investors reported a heavy volume of calls as clients attempted to make sense of the latest turmoil. Analysts said even amid rapidly moving and highly uncertain circumstances, the implications for a corporate priority such as the USMCA al are clear enough.\n\n\u201cFrom a purely market perspective, I think the impeachment conversation is being viewed as just another dynamic that will weigh on market sentiment until there is clarity on both the resolution and the longer-term implications,\u201d Compass Point\u2019s Isaac Boltansky said in an email.\n\nNegotiations over the trade deal had showed signs of progress in recent days. Robert Lighthizer, Trump\u2019s trade chief, was in talks with a working group of House Democratic lawmakers appointed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). They were trying to forge a compromise on Democratic demands for stronger labor, environmental and enforcement provisions \u2014 changes Pelosi demanded before agreeing to put the measure to a floor vote. \u201cBefore this weekend, USMCA was looking good,\u201d one top House Democratic aide tells me.\n\nBut revelations about Trump\u2019s call with his Ukrainian counterpart \u2014 and pressure the president applied for him to probe former vice president Joe Biden\u2014 reset the fall agenda. In a sign of how dramatically circumstances have shifted, some freshmen Democrats from swing districts who had been agitating for a USMCA vote in part to have a bipartisan accomplishment to tout at home became the driving force for an impeachment inquiry. Public calls from that cohort to zero in on Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine dissolved Pelosi\u2019s months-long resistance to taking the next step against the president.\n\n\"Perhaps Pelosi will schedule a vote on USMCA this year, but that strikes us as a political bridge too far,\" Cowen Washington Research Group's Chris Krueger wrote in a note. \"Ratify Trump's signature trade achievement while calling for his impeachment?\"\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)\n\n\u2014 Consumer confidence falls amid trade fears: \u201cU.S. consumer confidence ebbed in September as an escalation in trade tensions fanned concerns about business and labor market conditions, a potentially worrying signal for consumer spending, which has been driving the economy,\u201d Reuters\u2019s Lucia Mutikani reports.\n\n\u201cThe relatively downbeat survey from the Conference Board ... mirrors other confidence surveys and could renew financial market fears of a recession that had been assuaged somewhat by strong August retail sales, industrial production and housing data.\u201d\n\n\"The overall measure remains elevated,\" Bloomberg's William Edwards notes. But the drop represented the biggest slip since the beginning of the year. And it was steeper than economists expected.\n\n\u2014 Kashkari: The Fed is partially responsible for the slowdown. The Post's Heather Long: \"Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari says two factors are holding the U.S. economy back right now: President Trump\u2019s trade war and high interest rates. The current U.S. interest rate is a bit below 2 percent after the Fed lowered it slightly last week. Kashkari would like to see the rate cut to under 1.5 percent to stimulate the economy.\n\n\"'I\u2019m concerned that we\u2019ve needlessly raised interest rates over the past three years and put the economy into a more dangerous position that makes it more vulnerable to shocks that could hit us,' Kashkari told The Washington Post in an interview Tuesday. 'Why are we trying to contract the economy?'\"\n\n\u2014 Boris Johnson defiant after court ruling. Bloomberg's Tim Ross and Kitty Donaldson: \"A defiant Boris Johnson hit back at the U.K.\u2019s top judges and vowed to take the country out of the European Union next month, despite suffering an unprecedented legal defeat over his Brexit strategy in the highest court in the land. In a sweeping rebuke to the prime minister, Britain\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Johnson broke the law when he decided to suspend Parliament for five weeks in the run-up to the Oct. 31 deadline for leaving the EU.\"\n\nWhat's next: \"The ruling marks an extraordinary constitutional moment and an unprecedented political crisis for the U.K. It blows a hole in Johnson\u2019s political authority and calls into question his ability to remain in office as the Queen\u2019s principal adviser. Senior politicians, including the former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, demanded that he apologize to Parliament. While the opposition was quick to call for his resignation, Johnson\u2019s aides say he won\u2019t go.\"\n\nTRUMP TRACKER\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\nPresident Donald Trump addresses the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly. (Richard Drew/AP)\n\n\u2014 Trump laces into China in U.N. speech. USA Today's John Fritze: \"Trump accused China of 'gaming' the global trade system as he defended tariffs that his critics say have put the U.S. economy at risk of a recession. He repeated long-held criticism that the World Trade Organization is giving preferential treatment to China.\n\n\"Chinese delegates sat stone-faced as Trump also briefly praised protesters in Hong Kong this year who are opposing Beijing's tightening grip on the semi-autonomous city. 'We want balanced trade that is both fair and reciprocal,' Trump said. Trump said that while he wants a trade deal with China, he would 'not accept a bad deal for the American people.'\"\n\nSidebar: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appeared to find the speech less than riveting, as CNBC notes:\n\nWATCH: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appears to sleep during Trump\u2019s United Nations speech. pic.twitter.com/uOGGF0mamz \u2014 CNBC (@CNBC) September 24, 2019\n\nChinese foreign minister: \"Endless troubles\" if the countries delink. WSJ's Tyler Blint-Welsh: \"Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the so-called decoupling of the world\u2019s two largest economies would have disastrous results and that China and the U.S. need to work cooperatively through their disagreements. Mr. Wang\u2019s comments came as the U.S. and China remain at an impasse in a more than yearlong trade war, one that some analysts say could lead to a widening chasm between the two countries.\n\n\"'Decoupling from China\u2019s economy would be to decouple from opportunities, and the future,' said Mr. Wang, who in the past has called the U.S.\u2019s and China\u2019s interests 'inseparable.'\"\n\n\u2014 Google, Starbucks fight E.U.: \u201cAlphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Starbucks Corp. scored legal victories against European Union regulators,\" the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Valentina Pop and Sam Schechner report, \"in court rulings that restrict the reach of the bloc\u2019s privacy orders and deal a blow to its competition czar as she prepares to expand her regulatory powers.\"\n\n\u201cThe European Court of Justice ruled that Google doesn\u2019t generally have to apply the EU\u2019s \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 to versions of its search engine accessed outside the bloc\u2019s borders, though judges left the door open for European regulators to order it to do so in specific cases.\u201d\n\nPOCKET CHANGE\n\nAn employee works at a McDonald's restaurant in Chicago in 2018. (Nam Y. Huh/AP)\n\n\u2014 More workers to qualify for OT: \u201cWorkers making less than $35,500 are now entitled to mandatory overtime pay from their employers, under new rules announced by the Department of Labor. The new rules will take effect at the beginning of 2020,\u201d my colleague Eli Rosenberg reports.\n\n\u201cThe rules raise the salary threshold for workers for whom overtime pay \u2014 1.5 times a worker\u2019s typical hourly rate \u2014 is required from $23,600, a standard set in 2004 during the George W. Bush presidency. The Department of Labor under President Obama tried to raise the threshold to $47,000, a shift that would have given overtime pay to four million additional workers. But that proposal was met with strong opposition from business groups like the Chamber of Commerce, as well as Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Saudis consider doubling history\u2019s largest IPO: \u201cAfter attacks on its oil infrastructure, Saudi Arabia is moving forward with the much-anticipated initial public offering of its state-owned oil company and considering a proposal to offer investors a much bigger stake in the company than previously planned, people familiar with the matter said,\u201d the WSJ\u2019s Summer Said and Julie Steinberg report.\n\n\u201cThe Saudi Royal Court and its advisers have been debating an eventual float of as much as 10% of the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, doubling the country\u2019s longstanding public intention to list just 5%, according to these people. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \u2019s plan to expand what has already been billed as the world\u2019s largest IPO suggests his often outsize ambitions are undeterred, even as the country\u2019s oil giant attempts a full recovery from recent attacks on its largest facilities and faces risks to its valuation from subdued oil prices.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Pharma companies are ramping up their lobbying efforts: \u201cWorried drugmakers are stepping up efforts to blunt proposals in Washington that they view as some of the most serious threats to their pricing power in recent years,\u201d the WSJ\u2019s Peter Loftus reports.\n\n\u201cPharmaceutical industry trade organizations and outside groups are spending millions of dollars on advertisements attacking the proposals, which would peg drug prices in the U.S. to prices paid overseas and force companies to pay rebates if a drug\u2019s price increases by more than the rate of inflation \u2026 Industry executives and lobbyists are urging friendly lawmakers to pass legislation blocking the plans. They are also pushing administration officials to pursue measures that would pressure industry middlemen such as pharmacy-benefit managers to provide some relief on patients\u2019 costs without directly curbing drugmakers\u2019 pricing power.\u201d\n\nThis quote: \u201cWe\u2019re facing the stiffest political headwinds in the history of the industry,\u201d James Greenwood, president of the trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization, told the WSJ. BIO\u2019s member companies include Amgen Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Inc.\n\n\u2014 WeWork\u2019s CEO is out: WeWork co-founder and Chief Executive Adam Neumann \"was forced to step down and cede control of the shared-office startup after its much-anticipated initial public offering was derailed, capping a swift fall from grace for the leader of one of the country\u2019s most valuable startups,\u201d the WSJ\u2019s Eliot Brown, Dana Cimilluca, David Benoit and Maureen Farrell report.\n\n\u201cMr. Neumann will also cede majority control of the company, with his voting shares reduced to 3-to-1 from 10-to-1, the people said. The company earlier this month had reversed a recent enhancement to Mr. Neumann\u2019s voting power that allotted him 20 votes for each share he held.\u201d\n\nThe situation: \u201cMr. Neumann\u2019s position at the company became tenuous after We postponed an IPO earlier this month amid concerns from prospective investors about its governance and ability to reverse big losses. That skepticism has placed a major dent in the company\u2019s expected valuation, which has plummeted from $47 billion earlier this year to as low as $15 billion.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Hedge fun runs into Trump\u2019s vaping ban: \u201cJason Mudrick has been enjoying a run this year that most other hedge fund managers only dream of,\u201d Bloomberg News\u2019s Sridhar Natarajan and Josh Saul report. \u201cHis flagship fund at Mudrick Capital Management is up 32% on soaring valuations for one of the largest players in the U.S. vaping market.

Mudrick\u2019s controlling stake in the vaping venture has powered pretty much all of the gains in his flagship fund this year at a time when many other managers are posting tepid returns.\u201d\n\nMONEY ON THE HILL\n\nSen.
