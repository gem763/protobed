He\u2019s a captain, he\u2019s a dean\u2019s list honor student, he\u2019s confident, he\u2019s articulate, he\u2019s intelligent, he\u2019s thoughtful, he\u2019s caring and he\u2019s committed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got two of the most supportive parents, and I would be so blessed if my daughters would marry someone with his character and integrity one day.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, written by Johnstown, Pa., resident Dave Petersen, Sutherland\u2019s hair and overall appearance are criticized. Petersen, who described himself as an \u201colder\u201d graduate of the university, said in the letter that he and his wife \u201cmiss the clean cut young men and women from those days.\u201d\n\nPetersen also wrote that while he believes Sutherland will play in the NFL later in his career, he and his wife \u201chave stopped watching the NFL due to the disgusting tattoos, awful hair and immature antics in the end zone.\u201d\n\nIn a statement posted Tuesday on Twitter, Sutherland called Petersen\u2019s opinions \u201cdegrading,\u201d but said he took \u201cno personal offense.\u201d\n\nPetersen told the Tribune-Democrat, a newspaper in Johnstown, that he didn\u2019t intend for his letter to contain a racist message.\n\n\u201cWas not the intent at all,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cI would just like to see the coaches get the guys cleaned up and not looking like Florida State and Miami guys.\u201d\n\nPetersen added that the letter \u201cwasn\u2019t threatening or anything. I was just disgruntled about some of the hairdos that we\u2019re seeing. You think of Penn State as a bunch of clean-cut guys. And you do see so many who are clean cut. But the tattoos and the hair \u2014 there are a lot of guys with hair coming down their backs and it just looks awful. And it\u2019s the same for the NFL and NBA, too.\u201d\n\nPenn State University responded to the letter on social media, saying the school strongly condemns the message or any message of intolerance.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 Penn State Nittany Lions head football coach James Franklin denounced a racially insensitive letter that was sent to a player on the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
