While some states, like Georgia and Alabama, have passed stricter abortion laws, New York passed one that permitted the procedure pretty much up until the moment of birth. That\u2019s infanticide, but Democrats support it because supporting baby-killing is a hallmark characteristic of this party. Yes, it is an unpopular position. The country is roughly split 50-50 pro-life, pro-abortion. And while the vast majority does support the Roe v. Wade ruling, healthy majorities support restrictions on abortion especially after 20 weeks into a pregnancy. If there is one thing to get college-educated women in a frenzy, it\u2019s the pro-abortion propaganda peddled by the Left that Republicans seek to turn this nation into an episode of The Handmaiden\u2019s Tale. If you don\u2019t know what that is, fear not; no one watches it anyway (via The Hill):\n\nPlanned Parenthood's super PAC announced a $45 million electoral campaign on Wednesday to defeat President Trump and Republicans in key Senate races. The investment will fund a \"large-scale\" grassroots organization and canvass, digital, television, radio and mail programs. \"The stakes are higher than ever, and we're coming out more powerfully than ever with the largest investment we've ever made,\" said Kelley Robinson, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes, in an interview with The Hill. The campaign will focus on Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Those states are must-wins for Trump. But Republican senators are also fighting to keep their seats in Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina in races that will determine which party controls the Senate after 2020. The campaign, which could exceed $45 million, will tell voters there is a \"coordinated attack\" among Republicans in state legislatures, Congress and the White House to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that established the right to an abortion.\n\nPlanned Parenthood just announced a $45 million anti-GOP ad campaign in battleground states for 2020, but remember, PP is a women\u2019s health-care organization, not a political-action group. \u2014 Alexandra DeSanctis (@xan_desanctis) October 9, 2019\n\nI mean, this is just one of the many enemies we\u2019ll be facing next year. We all know the Left is coming after Trump and the rest of us\u2014hard. This isn\u2019t time to be compromising, empathetic, or compassionate. We need to kill these people\u2014politically speaking. Chop them down, put them through a meat grinder, douse the remains in gasoline, and set it on fire. We cannot be nice to the Left. We cannot be friends with the Left. We cannot show mercy to the Left. This will be a street fight. It\u2019ll be a year-long campaign, maybe longer, in the gutter. And I can\u2019t wait!\n\nAlso, funny how we all just forgot that the nation's largest abortion provider booted their recent president because she wasn't woke enough or something.", "description": ".10/10/2019 20:13:08PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/151/a7df6ae2-ecd5-4679-95b5-363dbb6b93a6.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
