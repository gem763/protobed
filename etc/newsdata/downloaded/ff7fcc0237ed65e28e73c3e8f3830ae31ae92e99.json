At the same time scientists played a recording of a warning call (threatening) or \u201ccontact calls\u201d (non-threatening).\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe next time jackdaws saw this same person, the birds that had previously heard the warning call were defensive and returned to their nests more than twice as quickly on average. Birds that heard contact calls still returned to their nests but took longer \u2013 they took 63 per cent of the time compared to birds that had not heard the call at all.\n\nThe study, published in Royal Society Open Science, looked at 34 jackdaw nest boxes.\n\n\u201cOne of the big challenges for a lot of animals is how to live alongside humans. People can provide some benefits, such as the food at bird feeders, but in some cases humans are also a threat,\u201d said lead author Victoria Lee, a PhD researcher at the University of Exeter.\n\n\u201cBeing able to discriminate between dangerous and harmless people is likely to be beneficial, and in this case we see jackdaws can learn to identify dangerous people without having had a bad experience themselves,\u201d she said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He chased the mother, then seized the calf in his huge gape, clearly intent on killingit. After trying to drown it, he tried to crush it to death. All the while, the distraught mother looked on. Infanticide among hippos is rare but may result from the stress caused through overcrowding when their day-resting pools dry out. Amale may also increase his reproductive chances by killing young that are not his, triggering females to go into oestrus, ready to mate with him. Male hippos are also aggressively territorial, and brutal fights are not uncommon.
