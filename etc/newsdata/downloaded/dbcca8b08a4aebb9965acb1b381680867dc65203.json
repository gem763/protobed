Jim Sensenbrenner Won\u2019t Seek Re-Election, Joining List of Retiring Republicans", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R., Wis.), the second-longest serving member of the House, on Wednesday said he wouldn\u2019t run for re-election next year, the latest Republican to announce plans to retire.\n\n\u201cWhen I began my public service in 1968, I said I would know when it was time to step back,\u201d Mr. Sensenbrenner, who was elected to the House in 1978, said in a statement. \u201cAfter careful consideration, I have determined at the completion of this term, my 21st term in Congress, it will be that time.\u201d\n\nMr. Sensenbrenner, 76 years old, once headed the House Judiciary Committee, on which he still serves. As chairman, he helped write and pass the Patriot Act, which expanded government surveillance powers, after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nRepublicans are announcing their departures en masse less than one year after Democrats took control of the House, with the departures concentrated in some delegations. Several Texas Republicans since late July have announced they wouldn\u2019t serve another term. In Wisconsin, Mr. Sensenbrenner follows Rep. Sean Duffy (R., Wis.), who announced less than two weeks ago that he wouldn\u2019t stand for re-election.
