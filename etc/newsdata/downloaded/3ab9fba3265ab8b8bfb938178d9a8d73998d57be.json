Rubenstein. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nDavid M. Rubenstein, one of Washington\u2019s richest men, has lately been in the business of protecting and restoring many of the country\u2019s historical treasures.\n\nHe\u2019s pumped millions of his billions into the Lincoln Memorial, the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial and Arlington House, which was the home of Robert E. Lee.\n\nRubenstein even bought \u2014 for $21.3 million \u2014 a copy of the Magna Carta, which is on loan to the National Archives.\n\nBut compared to the plaudits he\u2019s received for those efforts, Rubenstein says nothing comes close to the thanks he\u2019s received for the more than $10 million he has spent helping restore the Washington Monument.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really an iconic building and probably the most recognizable building in the United States,\u201d Rubenstein said Tuesday morning on the monument\u2019s observation deck. \u201cIt\u2019s a statement of American strength.\u201d\n\nThe 555-foot marble and granite landmark reopens to the public Thursday after years of repairs stemming from a 2011 earthquake. First lady Melania Trump is expected to attend a ribbon-cutting ceremony and visit the observation deck.\n\nRubenstein, who made his fortune in private equity at the Carlyle Group, initially donated $7.5 million to repair structural damage to the monument. After it reopened in 2014, the aging elevator repeatedly broke down, often stranding visitors.\n\nFollowing a second closure in 2016, Rubenstein kicked in an additional $3 million to modernize the elevator.\n\n\n\nPhilanthropist David Rubenstein outside the Washington Monument during a preview of the remodeled elevator and security systems on Tuesday.

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nVisiting the monument this week, Rubenstein recalled visiting as a child while growing up in a working-class neighborhood in Baltimore, where his dad was a mailman.\n\n\u201cMy parents brought me over here because the price was right,\u201d Rubenstein said, meaning it was, like nearly all Washington\u2019s other monuments and museums, free.\n\n(Forbes Magazine says he\u2019s now worth $3.2 billion, so presumably cost of admittance to any structure or event on Earth is not an issue.)\n\nIt was damage to the monument that got Rubenstein interested in historical philanthropy.\n\nHe asked officials at the National Park Service who would fix the monument and how much it would cost. Told that Congress would probably need to be involved, Rubenstein decided to put up the money himself so there wouldn\u2019t be too much delay.\n\n\u201cThen I realized there are other buildings that could probably use some money, so I began fixing up other things,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked what the return on investment was for him, Rubenstein said \u201cinfinite.\u201d But that\u2019s obviously not in terms of cold, hard cash.\n\n\u201cThomas Jefferson said part of what we want to do is pursue happiness,\u201d Rubenstein said. \u201cSo what produces the most happiness in the world?\u201d\n\nHaving happy and healthy children, he said.\n\nMaking your parents proud, he said.\n\nAnd this: \u201cWhen you have your fellow citizens think you\u2019re doing something useful, that\u2019s probably pretty good. I get a lot of pleasure out of doing these things, and if I didn\u2019t do them and I died with more money would I be a happier person? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\n\n\nOuterbridge Horsey of the Washington National Monument Society looks out at the Mall from the top of the Washington Monument during a tour Tuesday. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nRubenstein moseyed around the observation deck talking to reporters and looking out the windows, which frame some of the best views of Washington \u2014 the Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial, the White House.\n\nThen, dressed in a suit and tie, the 70-year-old billionaire prepared to climb a ladder up 19 feet to get a peek at the elevator\u2019s new machinery. A National Park Service official offered some advice: Always have three points of contact on the ladder.\n\n\u201cI can do it,\u201d Rubenstein said.\n\nAnd off he went.\n\nDescending the ladder a few minutes later, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think Melania is going to climb up there.\u201d", "description": "The monument, which has been closed for repairs, reopens Thursday because of Rubenstein\u2019s largesse.", "authors": ["Michael S.
