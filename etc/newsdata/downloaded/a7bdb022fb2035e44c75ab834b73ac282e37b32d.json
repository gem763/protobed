It would have to be a state-by-state proposition,\u201d Edmonds said.\n\nTesla last week said it was launching an insurance service designed to give drivers in California, its biggest market, lower rates because of safety features on its electric vehicles.\n\nThe company did not name an insurance partner, but the California Department of Insurance website showed Tesla was licensed as a broker to conduct business on behalf of the State National Insurance Company Inc, a unit of Markel Corp (MKL.N).\n\nChief Executive Elon Musk has been one of the strongest proponents of the idea that car insurance rates should plummet as driver-assist and self-driving technology become standard.\n\nU.S. insurers say they currently do not have sufficient data to validate auto industry promises of safety benefits from automated driving systems, citing automakers\u2019 reluctance to provide detailed information on models sold with those features, a lack of consistent standards, drivers\u2019 unpredictable use of the systems and higher repair costs.\n\nTesla is one of the few manufacturers whose vehicles are largely standard-equipped with advanced driver assistance features, including cameras monitoring lane keeping and recording vehicle surroundings.\n\nCalifornia regulatory insurance filings in May said Tesla\u2019s insurance product might use \u201cdirect data feeds with customer permission.\u201d\n\nBut Tesla\u2019s insurance website states it uses \u201canonymized, aggregate data\u201d to inform insurance rates, adding that it does not currently use data from individual vehicles, such as GPS or video footage.\n\nEdmonds on Wednesday said the company currently was not using much data beyond regular auto insurance pricing components, which include variables such as a driver\u2019s age, years of driving experience, safety record and annual mileage.\n\nHe declined to say when the company would consider using additional data to price insurance rates.\n\nAsked what states Tesla would expand its insurance program to next, Edmonds said: \u201cFind the states where the population is, those will be the states we\u2019ll be going to.\u201d", "description": "Tesla Inc's use of individual customer data, such as vehicle camera footage and GPS, to price its new insurance products will depend on drivers' authorization and individual U.S. state laws, a senior company executive said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Tina Bellon", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426412708&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840B1-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
