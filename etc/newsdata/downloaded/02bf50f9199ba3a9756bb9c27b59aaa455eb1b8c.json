McCloughan, a retired Army medic who is credited with saving the lives of 10 men during the war in Vietnam.\u201d\n\nTwitchy favorite Jeryl Bier asked in good faith earlier how McCloughan felt about being replaced by a hero dog in his photo:\n\nThe good news (for people with a sense of humor) is that according to the New York Times, McCloughan wasn\u2019t offended and laughed when presented with the Photoshop.\n\nThe photo President Trump shared seemed to be an altered version of a 2017 photo of James McCloughan receiving a Medal of Honor. McCloughan told The New York Times that he felt President Trump was recognizing the dog\u2019s heroism: \u201cThey are very courageous.\" https://t.co/XUWwq0b9Ie \u2014 The New York Times (@nytimes) October 30, 2019\n\n\u201cSeems to be an altered version.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on Wednesday, Mr. McCloughan, 73, who had not seen the image before a reporter sent it to him, said that he interpreted it as Mr. Trump recognizing the dog\u2019s heroism. He was not offended and laughed when he compared the two images. https://t.co/z7rp3gz9GZ \u2014 erin mccann | (@mccanner) October 30, 2019\n\nTo paraphrase Bier above, we wonder how the New York Times felt about tracking down McCloughan only to learn he was fine with the picture? Disappointed, probably.\n\nLet me give you a timeline. Trump tweets fun photo of himself giving the \"Medal of Pawnor\" to hero dog. The NYT launched into action and found the guy who got photoshopped over, hoping for a juicy angle to hit Trump with. Got this. This happened in the span of four hours. https://t.co/22wOxdKSuI \u2014 Brandon Morse (@TheBrandonMorse) October 30, 2019\n\nI like how they didn\u2019t tweet \u201cMcCloughan laughed\u201d from the article. That would really hurt the \u201cevil photoshopper President\u201d angle. \u2014 Jonny (@jonthnw) October 30, 2019\n\nThat reaction pretty much spoils your narrative. \u2014 Eric Fettmann (@EFettmann) October 30, 2019\n\nSorry he didn\u2019t get offended for your story!!! \u2014 Pouncing Coder Brad (@bradcundiff) October 30, 2019\n\nSo, he reacted like any reasonable person with a brain, and not someone suffering from extreme TDS\u2026. #RIPMedia \u2014 sarainitaly\ud83c\udf42\ud83c\udf83\ud83c\udf42\ud83c\udf83 (@sarainitaly) October 30, 2019\n\nMedia hardest hit. \u2014 Dale Betterton (@DaleBetterton) October 30, 2019\n\nWhat? But why wasn\u2019t Mr. McCloughan offended? WHY WASN\u2019T HE OFFENDED???!!!!\n\nAnswer: because Mr. McCloughan is a reasonable and sane person. \u2014 ultramarine (@pluripotency) October 30, 2019\n\nHow a normal person reacts. \u2014 NNK (@ancientmomma) October 30, 2019\n\nYes that\u2019s how humans react to obvious light-hearted jokes \u2014 Miami Fans Are Marijuana Addicts (@FanNoles) October 30, 2019\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this is happening to you \u2014 oh boy (@Welcome_2_Moes) October 30, 2019\n\nSo, you went on a fishing expedition looking for anti-Trump outrage and sadly only found a decent man with a sense of humour. Well done. \u2014 George (@memeXchange) October 30, 2019\n\nYou mean he has a sense of humor in 2019? \u2014 Cyn Champlin (@CynChamplin) October 30, 2019\n\nSo he's 73 and gets the meme more than people half his age taking offense to it. Take notes, NYT editorial staff. \u2014 random thoughts (@musings_n) October 30, 2019\n\nDoes this mean\u2026that the NYT\u2026lol\u2026actually used resources to find McCloughan to see if he\u2026lol\u2026was angered with a meme? Y'all\u2026y'all really are pieces of work. \u2014 Pablo Austerdo (@kraxicus) October 30, 2019\n\nWow, normal people find silly things to be silly. \u2014 Sloth Capital (@SlothCapital) October 30, 2019\n\neven the dude in the photo is taking this better then the NYT did. \u2014 HJ757 (@18milesout757) October 30, 2019\n\nYou wrote an article because the President retweeted a photoshopped picture of the dog who chased Baghdadi into a tunnel, and called the MOH recipient to ask his opinion. You guys don't actually wonder why people despise you, do you? \u2014 William (@LastWordWilliam) October 30, 2019\n\nNYT easily tracked down the person in the original image hoping that he will be outraged, yet he is OK with what Trump did with the fake dog photo. It's very possible if 30 reporters will hammer him, he's going to change his mind. \u2014 Yossi Gestetner (@YossiGestetner) October 30, 2019\n\nTo quote @ComfortablySmug \u201cthis is a joke you fucking morons\u201d \u2014 PrettyLieb (@prettylieb) October 30, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "It looks like the New York Times went fishing for a response they didn't get.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/new-york-times-building-2-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
