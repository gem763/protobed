Many online and high street stores are using a buy now, pay later service. Below, This is Money has revealed an example of which retailers use which service. Klarna: H&M, Topshop, Schuh, Michael Kors and Dr Martens Clearpay: Urban Outfitters, Foot Locker, Anthropologie, JD Sports and Boohoo Afterpay: Bare Minerals, Fenty Beauty, Forever21, Sunglass Hut and Skechers Laybuy: Footasylum, AX Paris, Bailey Nelson, Henmores and Timpanys\n\nAlthough M&S' decision to introduce Clearpay will be welcome for those who struggle to afford their shopping in one go, it has been criticised by debt charity, Stepchange.\n\nA spokesperson for Stepchange said: 'Buy-now, pay-later services are increasingly being marketed by online retailers to consumers as a source of convenience \u2013 a way of getting hold of the goods before needing to pay, and a way of spreading the cost over instalments rather than paying one lump sum.\n\n'While there's nothing intrinsically wrong with that, it's important to recognise that the main benefit to retailers of offering these services is to sell more of their goods than they otherwise might have done.\n\n'The convenience to the consumer may be real \u2013 but so is the financial commitment. And that message might not be being given as much prominence.\n\n'The principle that credit should be \"bought, not sold\" needs to apply just as much to these credit services as to any other loans or borrowing.\n\n'If we want to reduce the risk of people inadvertently taking on unaffordable financial commitments, borrowing shouldn't just be a by-product of marketing to support the sale of retail products.'\n\nCustomers looking to use buy now, pay later firms should make sure they will have enough money to be able to pay for the item at a later date.\n\nThis is because a significant amount of interest could potentially be added to your original purchase or, in the case of Klarna, if you can't pay by the third due date which is usually 120 days after the initial payment deadline, you would be passed to a debt collection agency.\n\nIn this situation, you could potentially find yourself stuck in a debt cycle or with a bad credit rating affecting future purchases.\n\nIf anyone is struggling with debt or wants to get advice on how to manage their money, they can speak to Stepchange, the Money Advice Service or even Citizens Advice.", "description": "M&S.com has partnered with Clearpay on the new service with the payment option due to be available to all UK M&S.com customers from mid-November.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
