It\u2019s disgusting. All the Republicans want to do is find out what is happening behind closed doors and they can\u2019t even share their side of the story, because all the whistleblowers and their lawyers have colluded with Schiff.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cDoes anyone even care in the administration? They don\u2019t even have a team that\u2019s fighting this thing. I mean I\u2019ve said more things on the show to push back against what\u2019s going on that I\u2019ve seen out of the White House. Where\u2019s the Senate? Where\u2019s Lindsey Graham? Why isn\u2019t he holding hearings? Why isn\u2019t he interviewing the people that are testifying behind closed doors? It\u2019s time for them to get tougher than they already are.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cYou know, you can say I condemn this. You can send a bunch of guys in to try to find out what\u2019s going on, but they need lawyers, they need killers, they need people with experience, parliamentarians who know who to fight this thing. Because right now, it\u2019s day after day, leak after leak, and they\u2019re losing the message war.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Thursday's broadcast of Fox News Channel's \"The Five,\" co-host Jesse Watters declared the White House and the Republicans were \"losing the message war\" | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/waters-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
