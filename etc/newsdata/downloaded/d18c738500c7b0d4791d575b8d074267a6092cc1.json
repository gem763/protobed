Labor won't declare its position until the committee's report is tabled.\n\nUniversities have been a firm supporter of the IA-CEPA, which could build on the already substantial links between the education sectors in the two countries and open the way for an Australian university to establish a campus to help cater for the educational demands of Indonesia's growing middle class.\n\nUniversity researchers face stiff fines if they travel to Indonesia on a tourist visa.

There is a big push underway to encourage researchers to work on joint projects with Indonesians.\n\n\"The Australian relationship with Indonesia is very deeply embedded but there always seems to be political or geopolitical issues cropping up,\" Associate Professor Oak said.\n\nEmma Connors is The Australian Financial Review's new Indonesia correspondent.
