Donatello\u2019s bronze David, the first free-standing nude male sculpture made since antiquity, was cast around the 1440s, depicting an androgynous boy too small for the great sword he bears. And in the early 1500s came Michelangelo\u2019s great marble David, an Apollonian warrior staring down his foe with calm determination, a colossus of masculine energy.\n\nIn between was Andrea del Verrocchio\u2019s \u201cDavid With the Head of Goliath,\u201d cast in bronze around 1465. It is not nearly so grand as Michelangelo\u2019s nor as voluptuous as Donatello\u2019s, and it is the smallest of the three. But it is a thrilling psychological depiction, and perhaps the only one that leaves the distinct impression that there\u2019s a real person inside the beautiful shell of a biblical hero. Verrocchio\u2019s David, an aristocratic adolescent with ferocious tension running through his graceful limbs, also has an enigmatic smile, which seems to say to doubters across the ages: You think I\u2019m not a killer?\n\nDavid is one of the stars of the National Gallery of Art\u2019s landmark Verrocchio exhibition, the first comprehensive U.S. survey devoted to the artist. Curated by Andrew Butterfield, \u201cVerrocchio: Sculptor and Painter of Renaissance Florence\u201d includes some 50 works, including several of the major masterpieces confidently attributed to the artist (along with David is the magnificent \u201cPutto With a Dolphin\u201d and the marble \u201cLady With Flowers\u201d) and a gallery full of paintings, many made with or by Verrocchio\u2019s principal students, collaborators or followers.\n\nVerrocchio was the teacher of Leonardo da Vinci, so the exhibition is particularly welcome in this 500th anniversary year of Leonardo\u2019s death in 1519. But he also was a teacher or close associate of Domenico Ghirlandaio, Pietro Perugino and Sandro Botticelli, and through those first two artists, effectively the teacher of the teachers of Michelangelo and Raphael, respectively.\n\nIt is too easy to think of Verrocchio, however, as merely an influence on, or progenitor of, greater things to come. His workshop, a cauldron of innovation and collaboration, was a catalyst of some of the greatest works of Renaissance art, and it is often difficult to disentangle the accomplishments of his better-known followers from his own prolific invention and experimentation.\n\n[Robert Frank left us \u2018The Americans,\u2019 and we can\u2019t escape it]\n\nThe exhibition acknowledges and explores the confusion and complexity of defining Verrocchio\u2019s canon, and that is the great strength of a show that is small by the usual blockbuster standards but extraordinarily potent. Visitors encounter David first, a marvel of design and casting skill (Verrocchio did his own casting, which was relatively rare for Florentine sculptors of his era). His technical skill can be seen in the slight fringe at the hem of the boy\u2019s jerkin, which is stretched taut across his frame and held together by small hooks on his left side, and in the clarity of the characters inscribed on the garment\u2019s trim. Even more engaging are the artist\u2019s narrative choices \u2014 the pathos of Goliath\u2019s head, which rests at the boy\u2019s feet, and the curious expression on David\u2019s face, which suggests the enigma of his character and foreshadows the man he will become, the king who rapes Bathsheba and sends her husband to his death.\n\n\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio, painting of the Madonna and Child (circa 1465-1470), tempera, oil and gold on panel.

(Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence)\n\nBut the David isn\u2019t even the best bronze in the exhibition. Even more stunning is the \u201cPutto With a Dolphin,\u201d a lighter-hearted work but even more impressive. The putto, a winged boy, twists on one foot, lightly touching the ground while clutching in his pudgy arms a slick, oversize fish with a curious canine expression on its face (it\u2019s a stretch to call it a dolphin). The miracle is in the flowing drapery that clings to the boy and billows behind him. Its surface is lightly hammered to make it resemble something like a thin animal skin, and its elaborate folds seem almost to defy the possibility of its having been made from poured bronze. And yet, with the exception of the boy\u2019s wings, the piece was apparently fashioned in a single cast.\n\nBoth the David and \u201cPutto With a Dolphin\u201d are securely attributed to Verrocchio, and both are mentioned in Giorgio Vasari\u2019s \u201cLives of the Artists,\u201d a problematic but indispensable source about artists of this period. Vasari, slightly condescending in his chapter on Verrocchio, tells us that the artist was experienced as \u201ca goldsmith, a master of perspective, a sculptor, a woodcarver, a painter, and a musician\u201d \u2014 and that he also studied geometry.\n\nThe exhibition includes fine examples of Verrocchio\u2019s metalwork (an agate vase with silver mountings and a magnificent bronze candelabrum) and a roomful of drawings, which is an impressive assemblage given the paucity of his drawings. Among them is a spectacular \u201cHead of a Woman With Braided Hair,\u201d which is likely one of the \u201ccertain heads of women, beautiful in expression and in the adornment of the hair, which Leonardo da Vinci was ever imitating for their beauty,\u201d as mentioned by Vasari.\n\nIt is a room of paintings, however, that is the most absorbing chapter of this exhibition. The National Gallery has moved, for the first time in about 30 years, its prized Leonardo, the portrait of Ginevra de\u2019 Benci, and placed it in a free-standing case in the middle of the room. This emphasizes not just Leonardo\u2019s relation to his teacher but also Verrocchio\u2019s broader role as an instigator and general prod to the creative energies of late-15th-century Florence. Many of the works in this room repeat a common theme \u2014 the Madonna and Child \u2014 with some painted, others made of plaster or terra cotta and others painted with or by his acolytes or admirers.\n\nThe repetition of the theme helps highlight the particular virtues of Verrocchio\u2019s unique contribution, especially in a work known as the Berlin Madonna and Child. Here one sees the sweetness and mystery for which Leonardo is often granted the historical patent, and the subtle shading and volume that makes Verrocchio\u2019s figures look more fully three-dimensional than those of other painters of his time. And the finicky pursuit of detail \u2014 the attention to such things as lace and texture of cloth, and how light hits gold threads woven into a piece of fabric. It is a stunning and deeply moving painting.\n\nThe inclusion of Leonardo\u2019s Ginevra portrait also lets visitors trace the DNA of an idea, from Verrocchio\u2019s marble carving of a \u201cLady With Flowers\u201d to Leonardo\u2019s painted version of what seems to be the same woman or, at least, the same general idea of a woman. Moving back and forth between sculptures and paintings is infinitely rewarding, and one begins to wonder how much of Verrocchio\u2019s painterly innovation was derived not just from studying life itself but also from studying life frozen in stone or metal. It\u2019s tempting to think that the shadows under the chin, and the highlights on the face and neck of the Berlin Madonna, are visual discoveries made from Verrocchio\u2019s own three-dimensional work.\n\n[Bill Viola at the Barnes makes all the rest of the Barnes look crazy]\n\nAnd so, too, the famous \u201csfumato,\u201d or haziness and shading of forms, celebrated in Leonardo\u2019s painting. It\u2019s not just in the Berlin Madonna but also in drawings such as the \u201cWoman With Braided Hair.\u201d When the geometry and surfaces of three-dimensional objects gets complicated, the mind tends to soften and resolve forms. We can\u2019t see deeply into complex surfaces, such as the billowing folds of the Putto\u2019s garment, so we register them in a kind of visual paraphrase. Perhaps Leonardo\u2019s signature painterly gesture also has its origins, or was furthered by, a response to the complexity of Verrocchio\u2019s sculpture and the curiously opaque expressions of his figures.\n\nThe exhibition also manages to give us a fleeting sense of something that has been mostly absent from Verrocchio\u2019s reputation: a sense of his personality. There isn\u2019t enough extant work to fully flesh out his character beyond the sparse details of his biography. But in certain grotesques (drawings of old men drinking and dancing), in a powerful painting of Saint Jerome\u2019s face, in the Berlin Madonna and in a fanciful rendering of a proposed tomb for a notable Venetian, we see a roundedness and richness that hasn\u2019t made it into the standard art historical accounts of the artist.\n\nIf Verrocchio is destined to be remembered primarily as Leonardo\u2019s teacher, we can at least see that what passed from master to pupil was far more than a set of skills or techniques for rendering facsimiles of the world. There was a world view, as well, a restlessness, a surfeit of curiosity and ambition, and perhaps even a shared sense of philosophical levity that transcends mere humor.\n\nVerrocchio: Sculptor and Painter of Renaissance Florence Through Jan. 12 at the National Gallery of Art. nga.gov.\n\nRead more by Philip Kennicott:\n\nWhat perpetual war looks like in America\n\nObituaries are the only redemptive news anymore\n\nDoes the Kennedy Center have a vision for its elegant but awkward new annex?", "description": "Verrocchio emerges from the shadows in a landmark exhibition at the National Gallery of Art.", "authors": ["Philip Kennicott", "Art", "Architecture Critic", "September At Pm", "Philip Kennicott Is The Pulitzer Prize-Winning Art", "Architecture Critic Of The Washington Post.
