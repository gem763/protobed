Bolton, because he \u201cdisagreed\u201d strongly with his suggestions and so did others.\n\n\u201cI asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter.\n\nAn NSA deputy, Charlie Kupperman, will serve as acting national security adviser, according to the White House.\n\nMr. Bolton was swiftly subtracted from a White House briefing he was slated to attend Tuesday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s entitled to the staff that he wants,\u201d Mr. Pompeo told reporters. \u201cWhen the president makes a decision like this, he\u2019s well within his rights.\u201d\n\nThe secretary said he wouldn\u2019t dish on \u201cpalace intrigue,\u201d though smiled in suggesting it\u2019s tough to catch him off guard in this administration: \u201cI\u2019m never surprised.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s ousting caused shockwaves through Washington, though there had been multiple reports of tensions between Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo on some of Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest foreign policy initiatives, including the now-collapsed peace deal with Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban and the nuclear talks with North Korea.\n\n\u201cI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Bolton tweeted Tuesday. He also signaled to various media outlets that he resigned, resisting the narrative he was fired.\n\nYet White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters that Mr. Trump asked for Mr. Bolton\u2019s resignation late Monday. He said Mr. Bolton\u2019s priorities and policies \u201cjust don\u2019t line up with the president\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no one issue here,\u201d Mr. Gidley said. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t align on many issues.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton, a noted hawk on North Korea as a private analyst, was famously touring in Mongolia when Mr. Trump made a surprise visit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un this summer at the border between North and South Korea.\n\nMr. Bolton reportedly argued against the proposed deal \u201cin principle\u201d that Mr. Trump was weighing with Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban, saying the Pentagon could begin Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal of troops from the country without striking a deal with the radical Islamist militant movement.\n\nMr. Bolton was one of the administration\u2019s most reliably hawkish voices, urging a tough line against the socialist government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the theocratic government in Iran. He also had a reputation as a feared bureaucratic infighter.\n\nSpeculation about whether Mr. Bolton may be fired or on the verge of stepping down has swirled for months among U.S. national security analysts.\n\nSeveral of whom have spoken on condition of anonymity with The Washington Times in recent weeks, saying Mr. Trump was weighing the decision carefully and had even secretly interviewed possible replacements.\n\nHowever, others, including some with close ties to the administration, had claimed as recently as this week hat Mr. Trump was happy with Mr. Bolton.\n\nOne former U.S. official told The Washington Times on Monday that \u201cBolton is going to be there for the long haul. He\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump was seen to have openly criticized Mr. Bolton during a June interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d although the president also said that he appreciated having Mr. Bolton as a conservative foreign policy hardliner on his national security team.\n\n\u201cJohn Bolton is absolutely a hawk,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time. \u201cIf it was up to him, he\u2019d take on the whole world at one time, OK? But that doesn\u2019t matter because I want both sides.\u201d\n\nBy Tuesday, though, Mr. Trump said he\u2019d had enough.\n\n\u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nReaction from Capitol Hill started to pour in.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican and key Trump ally, said he liked Mr. Bolton but that the president deserved to feel comfortable with his team.\n\n\u201cAs national security adviser to President Trump, I found him to be accessible and always pursuing an agenda that not only helps the president but makes America safe,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cPresident Trump, like every other president, has the right to a national security adviser of his own choosing.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, said they were happy to see Mr. Bolton go.\n\n\u201cJohn Bolton is the architect of the Iraq war, the reason for our lack of an Iran strategy, and responsible for the pointless deaths of thousands of Americans. Good riddance. I hope his replacement is less incompetent,\u201d Rep. Ruben Gallego, Arizona Democrat and member of the House Armed Services Committee, said on Twitter.\n\nOther Democrats said while they weren\u2019t fans of Mr. Bolton, either, although they worried the ousting was another sign of chaos in the Trump White House.\n\nMr. Bolton was pushed out the same day Mr. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, received a sentencing date in his long-running legal case stemming from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action by the president is just the latest example of his government-by-chaos approach and his rudderless national security policy,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said. \u201cWhen Ambassador Bolton\u2019s extreme views aren\u2019t enough for you, the United States is headed for even more chaotic times.\u201d\n\nA firing-via-tweet would normally be viewed as unusual, but it\u2019s become commonplace in Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington.\n\nThe president frequently makes major news via his account. He announced the firing of his first secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, on Twitter and the White House recently announced increased tariffs on China by simply copying and pasting Mr. Trump\u2019s latest tweet into an official statement.\n\n\u2022 Lauren Meier contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
