(Picture: NETFLIX)\n\nTurns out there\u2019s a pretty stellar plot twist, because not all is at it seems (der), which has got the masses talking.\n\nFans were loving the twist, as one wrote on Twitter: \u2018Sam Worthington did a great job in his movie \u201cFRACTURED\u201d 2019 movie of netflix.\n\n\u2018After watching it, seems like I\u2019ll end up in a mental hospital with him. This is what you called \u201cREAL TWIST\u201d everything in the scene is unpredictable. Great Job, NETFLIX.\u2019\n\nAnother was just really ruddy confused as they chimed into the feed: \u2018Halfway through Fractured on Netflix, and what the hell is going on?\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s hoping they now have closure.\n\nThey weren\u2019t the only one taking to Twitter halfway through the film, though, as another fan wanted their thoughts known.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m watching #fractured on Netflix and I have absolutely NO IDEA what is happening\u2026 on the edge of my seat atm! If it\u2019s good enough to tweet about it before you even finish it, you KNOW you gotta check it out!\u2019\n\nIn the film Avatar star Worthington\u2019s character is joined by his wife Joanne (Lily Rabe) and daughter Peri (Lucy Capri) as they travel back from a Thanksgiving weekend with his in-laws which was, for lack of a better word, tense.\n\nPeri is then rushed to the hospital after she falls and injures herself, with Ray being left in the waiting room as his wife accompanies the young girl to a scan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe passes out while waiting and when he comes to the hospital has no record of the family\u2019s arrival, or of Peri\u2019s scan.\n\nIs there a sinister plot afoot within the hospital? Did his family exist? Is Ray going around the twist?\n\nSome have branded it similar to Shutter Island, read into that what you will.\n\nJust in time for Halloween and some Netflix and Chills, right?\n\nFractured is on Netflix now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
