Stop. Look. Listen. Always assume a train is coming.'\n\nThe train was part of the Highspeed train service which runs from London St Pancras International or Stratford International to Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International to Kent.\n\nVincent van der Hoeven, route level crossing manager for Network Rail, was taken aback by the incident which could have become 'a considerably more serious accident'.\n\nHe said it is an 'eye-opening reminder to not underestimate' the dangers of being distracted when crossing railways. His team are reviewing safety protection and encourage people to 'remain attentive at all times'.\n\nBritish Transport Police Inspector John Pine added: 'This is absolutely shocking footage and the person involved is incredibly lucky not to have been seriously injured, or even worse, killed.\n\n'It is hard to comprehend how anyone can have such disregard for the dangers of the railway, and I hope this serves as a strong reminder of the need for vigilance and safety when using level crossings.'\n\nThe crossing (pictured) sees more than 120 trains pass through daily and there have been seven near-misses since July last year\n\nThe highspeed train service runs from London St Pancras International or Stratford International to Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International and has many stopping points in Kent\n\nPeople were quick to slam the biker's stupidity on BBC South East's Facebook.\n\nBen Cartwright wrote: 'Obviously lacks basic intelligence to first look in the direction of incoming traffic of which side he\u2019s standing.'\n\nGreg Ward commented on the viral clip: 'Makes my blood boil it's the driver that has to deal with it if was a hit or not.'\n\nAndrew Fishpool added: 'Shallow end of the gene pool clearly.'\n\nAnother added: 'I bet he pooed himself and cried and is now showing his mates the clip giving it large and acting the tough guy.'\n\nA third wrote: 'And no doubt had he been hit by the train, we would see his tearful family on the news, whinging on about how Network Rail are to blame for the loss of their little angel, how it was not their fault he was illegally riding a bike with no helmet, insurance, or licence.'\n\nThe station sees more than 120 trains pass through daily and there have been seven near-misses since July last year.\n\nAnd the number of people risking death on UK railways lines is the highest in seven years, according to Network Rail.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2017, 1,100 level crossings have been closed across the country for improved safety.\n\nAnyone with any information regarding the Shornemead incident should contact the British Transport Police either by texting 61016 or call 0800 40 50 40, quoting reference 278 of 22/10/19.", "description": "A motorcyclist narrowly escaped death after trying to ride across the Shornemead level crossing near Gravesend, Kent, last weekend.
