He said he expected Turkey to protect civilians and religious minorities and prevent a humanitarian crisis - as Turkey has said it would.\n\nTurkey's military action against Kurdish fighters in northeast Syria is aimed at restoring the region's demographic structure and sending Syrians back to their own homes, Erdogan said, adding \"109 terrorists have been killed so far\" in the operation.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council will meet on Thursday to discuss Syria at the request of the five European members, Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Poland.\n\nIn a letter to the 15-member Council, Turkey said its military operation would be \"proportionate, measured and responsible\".\n\nThe 22-member Arab League said it would hold an emergency meeting on Saturday.\n\nDivided opinion\n\nRussia said it planned to push for dialogue between the Syrian and Turkish governments following the incursion.\n\nTurkey has \"legitimate concerns about the safety of its borders\" but had not been able to properly raise them with Damascus as this was \"made difficult by the actions of the Americans and the coalition\" east of the Euphrates river, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.\n\n\"We have warned for many years about the extreme danger of the experiment that the Americans were staging there in an effort to pit the Kurds against Arab tribes,\" Lavrov told journalists in Turkmenistan.\n\n\"We warned against playing the Kurdish card because it can end badly.\"\n\nItaly condemned the Turkish offensive as \"unacceptable\", saying military action in the past always led to \"terrorism\".\n\nThe French foreign ministry, meanwhile, called in Turkey's ambassador for a meeting later on Thursday.\n\n\"He will be summoned this afternoon following the offensive on Syria,\" said a diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity.", "description": "President Erdogan comes out swinging at opponents of Syria military operation, calling Egypt a 'murderer of democracy'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/10/fc39c636ce46406e8e5742a1ed56b279_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
