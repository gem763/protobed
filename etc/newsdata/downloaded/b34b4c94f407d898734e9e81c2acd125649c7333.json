Then he met with Rudy Giuliani.\n\nShortly after being named the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations in mid-2017, Kurt Volker attended an invitation-only strategy session at the Atlantic Council with a small group of foreign-policy hands.\n\nThere, he encouraged the people gathered at the downtown D.C. think tank to publicly praise President Donald Trump for his handling of Russia and Ukraine. It might have been in jest, but Volker\u2019s point was obvious: Flattering Trump might lead him to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and act in the U.S. interest, as one attendee put it.\n\nTwo years later, Volker has resigned the envoy role after becoming ensnared the Ukraine-related scandal that is consuming Trump\u2019s presidency and fueling an impeachment drive by House Democrats. It\u2019s an ominous turn for the widely respected diplomat, who joined the Trump team even as dozens of veterans of past Republican administrations shunned the new president.\n\nThe envoy's resignation came as three House committees slapped Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with a subpoena, demanding information on the controversy and scheduling depositions for five State Department officials, including Volker.\n\nThe news of Volker's departure was first reported by a student news organization at Arizona State University and confirmed to POLITICO by a person familiar with the issue.\n\n\u201cKurt, in particular as a former career ambassador, knows where the lines should be drawn\" \u2014 Former White House official\n\nIt also comes a day after Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, claimed that Volker had asked him to talk to Ukrainian officials \u2014 discussions that may have involved demands that Ukraine dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, the current Democratic 2020 frontrunner.\n\nOn Thursday, Giuliani publicly shared what he said were text messages from Volker. One of the messages, dated July 19, shows Volker telling Giuliani he \u201creally enjoyed breakfast this morning\u201d before adding: \u201cAs discussed, connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky. I suggest we schedule a call together on Monday \u2013 maybe 10am or 11am Washington time?\u201d\n\nGiuliani revealed the text messages, he said in a Fox News appearance on Thursday evening, to bolster his claim that he was fulfilling a State Department request to meet with Ukrainian officials. \u201cHe should step forward and explain what he did,\u201d Giuliani told host Laura Ingraham, referring to Volker.\n\nThe State Department \u201cbasically knew everything I was doing,\u201d Giuliani added.\n\nVolker, who declined to comment, has not stepped forward to explain what he did. But he has not denied sending the messages. Nor have Pompeo and other top State Department officials explained what role senior leaders in Foggy Bottom played in Giuliani\u2019s efforts.\n\nPeople who know Volker say he was probably well aware of the risk he was taking in deciding to work for Trump.\n\n\u201cYou can argue about whether people should take jobs in this administration or not,\u201d said Evelyn Farkas, a Russia specialist and top Pentagon official under former President Barack Obama, \u201cbut there are people who are well-intentioned, who think they can advance the U.S. interest and do damage control, and I think he falls into that category.\u201d\n\nVolker is a former career Foreign Service officer who served as an unpaid U.S. envoy part-time, while holding other, paid positions, including as an adviser to a lobbying firm and as executive director of a Washington think tank named for the late Arizona Sen. John McCain.\n\nHe largely stayed out of the limelight while in the Trump administration. His exact role in the still-unfolding Ukraine scandal remains murky, though the whistleblower whose complaint set off the Democrats\u2019 impeachment push this week said his understanding was that Volker was trying to \u201ccontain the damage\u201d inflicted on U.S. policy by Giuliani, and help Ukrainian officials \u201cnavigate\u201d Trump\u2019s requests.\n\nGiuliani has repeatedly mentioned Volker, as well as U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, as two State Department officials he briefed on his conversations with Ukrainians linked to the country\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nDespite his efforts, the former New York mayor hasn\u2019t put to rest the question of who initiated the idea of him meeting the Ukrainians.\n\nAccording to the State Department, it was Yermak, the Zelensky adviser, who asked Volker to connect him to Giuliani. Yermak may have done so because Giuliani had spent much of the spring publicly talking about Ukraine-related issues, including unproven claims that Biden and his son, Hunter, were involved in corrupt activity. The fledgling new Ukrainian government may have decided it had to establish a link to Giuliani.\n\nThe Biden-related allegations were on Trump\u2019s mind, too. According to a memorandum the White House released this week under pressure from Democrats, in a phone call between Trump and Zelensky on July 25, the U.S. president repeatedly urged his new Ukrainian counterpart to look into the claims against the Bidens. Trump also pressed Zelensky to connect with Giuliani and U.S. Attorney General William Barr.\n\n\u201cRudy very much knows what\u2019s happening and he is a very capable guy,\u201d Trump told the Ukrainian leader. \u201cIf you could speak to him that would be great.\u201d\n\nVolker was not mentioned on the call. But the whistleblower\u2019s complaint mentions his name five times, along with Sondland\u2019s. The whistleblower, whom The New York Times has describedas a CIA officer, cited his conversations with other concerned U.S. officials as evidence that the two diplomats were well aware of Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine-related activities.\n\nSome former officials and analysts said Volker looked foolish in having engaged Giuliani at all, given that the president\u2019s personal lawyer is a private citizen who is not formally authorized to represent the United States to foreign governments.\n\n\u201cHe should have known better,\u201d a former White House official said on condition of anonymity to speak frankly. \u201cKurt, in particular as a former career ambassador, knows where the lines should be drawn.\u201d\n\nOther observers suggested cutting him slack.\n\nThey said Volker \u2014 always ambitious \u2014 was more willing to pursue unorthodox methods than many diplomats if he believed it could help achieve U.S. goals. Knowing how much Trump relies on Giuliani may have factored in Volker\u2019s calculations, too, some said.\n\n\u201cGiuliani is already doing this stuff, and then the Ukrainians are saying, \u2018Look, what do we do?\u2019\u201d said Dan Fried, a retired 40-year State Department veteran with extensive experience on Eastern Europe and Russia. \u201cYou could say, \u2018Don\u2019t talk to Giuliani,\u2019 but would you truly give that advice to the Ukrainians if you knew that refusal to talk to him would piss off Trump?\u201d\n\nVolker, now 54, spent many years in the Foreign Service, working under multiple presidents and focusing largely on U.S.-European policy. He served a short stint as U.S. ambassador to NATO starting under President George W. Bush, earning a reputation as a skilled operator with serious policy chops.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had the utmost respect for Kurt,\u201d said Alina Polyakova, a Russia and Ukraine expert at the Brookings Institution. \u201cHe\u2019s someone genuinely interested in helping resolve the conflict in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nWhile aligned with Republicans, Volker was well-regarded among Democrats. Unlike many prominent GOP national security experts, Volker didn\u2019t sign the \u201cNever Trump\u201d letters circulated during the 2016 campaign \u2014 a testament, perhaps, to his reputedly keen political instincts.\n\nAt the time, Volker explained that he wanted to be free to advise future presidents of all stripes, though he didn\u2019t intend to serve in an administration led by Trump. \u201cHe would actually use it as a bragging right,\u201d he told Reuters in a March 2016 interview.\n\nThat decision made it possible for Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s first secretary of state, to tap Volker for the Ukraine envoy role early on, while those who did sign the letters were blackballed.\n\n\u201cKurt\u2019s wealth of experience makes him uniquely qualified to move this conflict in the direction of peace,\u201d Tillerson said in a statement announcing the move. Russia hawks, alarmed at the new president\u2019s overtures to the Kremlin, praised Volker\u2019s appointment as a welcome sign.\n\n\u201cHe brings the right experience and judgment needed to represent the United States as we continue in our efforts to stop Russia's aggressive actions in Ukraine,\u201d McCain said at the time.\n\nVolker struggled, however, to make much progress in ending the conflict, though not for lack of trying\u2014it may be an impossible task given Moscow\u2019s recalcitrance, observers say.\n\nIn the meantime, Volker's unusual arrangement with the Trump administration drew notice: He essentially was a part-time volunteer envoy who held other positions.\n\nThose include serving as the executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership, a D.C.-based think tank that is part of Arizona State University, and acting as an adviser to the BGR Group, lobbying and public relations firm in Washington that temporarily represented the previous Ukrainian government. (BGR Group says Volker recused himself from all issues related to the government of Ukraine.)\n\nSome former U.S. officials privately expressed discomfort with Volker\u2019s overall setup, saying it was often unclear in what capacity Volker was operating. But all stressed that they\u2019ve seen no clear evidence of improper activity or a conflict of interest, and none has emerged publicly.\n\nVolker\u2019s mission was supposed to focus narrowly on resolving aspects of the Russia-Ukraine military standoff, but at times he seemed to go beyond that remit, the former White House official noted. He spoke out, for example, on a dispute between Hungary and Ukraine over the latter\u2019s adoption of a law giving special status to the Ukrainian language.\n\nThe strangest thing about Volker\u2019s role, a former U.S. diplomat said, may be that it was part time given that \u201cour relationship to Ukraine is a really important one.\"", "description": "Kurt Volker was a well-regarded diplomat trying to solve one of the world\u2019s hottest conflicts.
