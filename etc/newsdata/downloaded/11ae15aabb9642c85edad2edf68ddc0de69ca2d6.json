They love her so much and they run for several blocks behind her car when she\u2019s travelling through the city. This shot was taken at Paris fashion week in 2014. It was the first day she arrived in Paris and so things were especially intense.\n\nWe\u2019d just left the Balmain show and it was really hard to get through this huge crowd of people to the car. When we got inside we were instantly surrounded by people. If you look closely, one of the fans outside has their phone set to record mode \u2013 I don\u2019t think you can actually see anything through the glass but they\u2019re still trying. It was quite eerie, almost a little scary. Rihanna is more used to these kinds of situations than other people, but even for her that moment was kind of crazy.\n\nNothing was planned about the shot. Looking at her expression and the way she looks at the camera, I don\u2019t think she knew I was going to take a picture in that moment. It\u2019s very real, it captures how she felt. Sometimes when you see celebrities in the news they almost don\u2019t seem like human beings with emotions. But here, even though she\u2019s been in the business since she was a teenager, [this situation] triggered something. You can see that emotion in the picture.\n\nEven though she's been in the business since she was a teenager, [this situation] triggered something. You can see that emotion\n\nBefore I met Rihanna I was fascinated by her as a pop star and as a person. She seemed very bold, very authentic and very fun. Before the Diamonds world tour in 2013 she asked me to come along and capture what happens between concerts. We got along well, so we kept working together. She already had a book in mind when we met, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve spent the last six years doing. This shot was one of the key images for it. She didn\u2019t want it to feature anything posed or set up \u2013 she wanted it to capture her life out of her eyes. So even on red carpets with a lot of paparazzi I would have to try to find a fresh angle \u2013 maybe include the photographers in the shot, or show a different perspective.\n\nObviously, as a photographer, Rihanna is the best subject you can ask for. She\u2019s very comfortable in front of the camera. The key thing was building a relationship with her. I can kind of feel her mood to know when it\u2019s the right time to shoot, and what kind of pictures she would like. You don\u2019t want to interrupt her workflow. She\u2019s so dedicated to the cause, whatever she does: make up, music, styling. She will not ever do anything she doesn\u2019t believe in. She works crazy hours. It\u2019s awesome to witness.\n\nWhen you spend 24 hours a day with someone \u2013 on a jet, on a bus \u2013 you become very close. But it was always important that I knew my assignments and remained professional. I would go to an after party with her but maybe go home at 2am and start editing pictures.\n\nRihanna\u2019s very aware of the people around her and she helps them grow with her. Working with her has helped my career in every way. I\u2019ve got to shoot people you would normally never get to shoot. I\u2019ve got pictures of Rihanna and Karl Lagerfeld together \u2013 the access has been incredible. It\u2019s also presented me with lots of challenges. When you\u2019re shooting in a studio you get to dictate everything that\u2019s going to happen on your set. But on tour, when you\u2019re taking a picture at 4am with no light and you can\u2019t use a flash, the situation dictates what sort of photo you can take. It really challenges you to get a good picture.\n\nLuckily, there is a trust between us. I think she felt OK to show a side to her that she might not show to other people or photographers.\n\n\u2022 Rihanna is published by Phaidon, \u00a3120.\n\nDennis Leupold\u2019s CV\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Noam Galai/Getty Images for NYFW\n\nBorn: Duisberg, Germany.\n\nTraining: I learned myself, from working with all kinds of amazing photographers.\n\nInfluences: \u201cPeter Lindbergh is the main one \u2013 he grew up in the same town and was always the person I look up to.\u201d\n\nHigh point: \u201cI hope it\u2019s still coming!\u201d\n\nLow point: \u201cWhen I started in 2007 there was a recession in the US.
