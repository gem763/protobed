If you want to convince your employer to let you work from home, experts say these are some tactics you should use. Buzz60\n\nLast month, Michael Richman, owner of Academy Awning in Montebello, California, waded gingerly into the modern world of flexible work schedules, allowing a 22-year-old designer to come in at odd hours so he could go back to college full time.\n\nIt didn\u2019t go well.\n\nThe designer wasn\u2019t available midday to answer questions from an East Coast customer and was hard-pressed to quickly address concerns raised by welders and other factory employees at the awning maker, which has 35 staffers. Richman also wondered how much the designer was really working when he was alone in the office.\n\nMichael Richman (Photo: Handout)\n\n\u201cIt was a disaster,\u201d Richman says. \u201cWe have to have a somewhat regimented schedule. To have people coming and going at different times creates disruption.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s new flexible workplace is going through some growing pains.. Many businesses are allowing variable hours \u2013 as well as work-from-home options -- to attract employees in a tight labor market. But as adoption grows, a significant share are struggling to make it work. Consultants say that\u2019s because many companies haven\u2019t put technology and other tools in place to ensure seamless communication and collaboration with co-workers and customers.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t integrated it as part of their overall strategy,\u201d says Cali Williams Yost, CEO of Flex + Strategy Group, which helps companies adopt flexible work arrangements. \u201cWe\u2019re asking people to work differently but not telling them how to do it.\u201d\n\nAs a result, some companies are throwing up their hands and going back to traditional work policies while others are ironing out the kinks through trial and error. The gap among firms is underscored by widely varying measures of the portion of businesses with flexible hours. A spring survey by the Society for Human Resource Management found that 57% of organizations offer flexible schedules, up from 52% in 2015.\n\nA separate poll by Flex + Strategy revealed that 98% of companies provide some form of fluctuating hours based on a broad definition that could include letting employees leave occasionally to pick up kids at school or go to the doctor. At the other extreme are businesses that let workers choose their own hours.\n\nMillennial seek a better work-life balance.

In fact, that\u2019s their chief way of coping with unemployment that\u2019s at a 50-year low of 3.5% and spells fewer available workers. Thirty-eight percent of hiring managers are raising pay and twenty-six percent allow remote work.\n\nHarassed on the job?: More than 90% of employees say they've been bullied at work\n\nWhile the 44% share is noteworthy, it\u2019s lower than the other measures because it\u2019s likely capturing only employers that have adopted formal strategies to make flexible schedules work over the long term and are confident enough to tout the policy to job seekers, Yost says.\n\nIn late 2017, the vast majority of workers said they had some degree of work flexibility but just 42% said they\u2019d been trained on how to manage it, down from 47% in 2015, according to a survey by Flex + Strategy.\n\nSome companies don\u2019t formalize flexible work arrangements because they want to offer them quietly to certain employees rather than across the board, says Sara Sutton, CEO of FlexJobs, which posts jobs for remote, part-time and freelance work and provides related consulting services. That, she says, causes jealousy. Others offer flexibility but still try to reach employees during off-hours.\n\nSOURCE USA Today/LinkedIn survey of 502 U.S. hiring managers, 9/23-9/26 (Photo: USA TODAY)\n\nMillennials started it all\n\nThe shift to more flexible work set-ups has been driven by millennials, who could complete and submit their college assignments anytime, anywhere as a result of the prevalence of Wi-Fi, smartphones and email, Sutton says. They also yearn for a healthy work-life balance.\n\n\u201cThey grew up with this,\u201d she says.\n\nSeventy-seven percent of employees consider flexible work a major consideration in their job searches, according to Zenefits, which provides human resource software. And 30% have left a job because it didn\u2019t provide flexible work options, a FlexJobs poll reveals.\n\nBusinesses are responding, largely because they have little choice in the hypercompetitive labor market, Yost says. Technology such as smartphones, cloud computing and work collaboration tools such as Slack also have paved the way. So has a work culture that often requires employees to answer emails late at night or on vacation. Companies can hardly ask workers to make such sacrifices without providing them more leeway to adjust their hours or location during the workday, Yost says.\n\nYet increased flexibility also boosts productivity, Yost says. Sixty percent of employees with workplace flexibility said they feel more productive and engaged and forty-five percent say it increases their ability to work effectively with their team, according to the Flex + Strategy survey.\n\nWhy? The ability to shift hours to avoid rush-hour traffic, for example, increases efficiency. Some people are more productive late at night than mid-morning. And employees granted flexible hours are more loyal and motivated.\n\n\u201cWhen you give people flexibility, they will give you more,\u201d Yost says.\n\nLast year, Sara Martlage, 31, left a sales job at a freight company where she felt chained to a desk for a similar role at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Trainual, which provides employee training software, largely because the firm lets her adjust her schedule. While the official hours are 8 to 5, Martlage can come in later to attend a workout or yoga class, run errands midday and work from home as much as half the time.\n\nSara Martladge (Photo: Handout)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s empowering to have authority over your schedule,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me want to work harder, be available to take calls and answer email some nights and weekends to go above and beyond to keep my work integrity intact with the rest of my teammates.\u201d\n\nThe plight of temp workers: 'I have no spare money': UAW-GM labor fight spotlights the struggles of temp workers\n\nFlex hours as a recruitment tool\n\nChris Ronzio, CEO of Trainual, says he adopted flexible hours about two years ago, chiefly to attract workers. Four recent hires, he says, accepted job offers because of the policy. And it has freed him from keeping a detailed ledger of employees\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting more trust into our team, and measuring them more by the results they produce than by the hours they log,\u201d Ronzio says. The 19-employee firm has begun tracking monthly and quarterly sales figures more closely to ensure workers are meeting targets.\n\nOther companies have hit some bumps along the way. GoBrandgo, a St. Louis marketing company, began letting employees set their own hours and work from anywhere about 10 years ago, says partner Brandon Dempsey. At first, he said, it bred resentment because each division had a different standard for flexible hours and no way to know when co-workers weren\u2019t available.\n\nSeveral years ago, he says, the company started an online calendar that employees fill out at the start of the week, letting colleagues know when they\u2019re working and when they\u2019re out, as well as project management software that tracks the status of every job. Employees must be available for client meetings every two weeks and work more closely in teams so they can answer a client\u2019s question if a co-worker is out.\n\nBrandon Dempsey, an owner of GoBrandGo, with employees at firm's headquarters in St. Louis (Photo: Handout)\n\n\u201cEverybody knows the rules of the game now,\u201d Dempsey says.\n\nStaffers, he says, are more productive, in part because they can clock hours best suited to their circadian rhythms and not think about home while they're at work, and vice versa. \"Be present wherever you are,\" he says.\n\nNicole Turner, 33, the creative director, routinely has put in five or six hours during the day at the office and then toiled at home from 7 PM to as late as 2 a.m.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more creative late at night,\u201d she says.\n\nNow that she has a 2-year-old son, her hours are more normal, though she still sometimes takes off part of the day to care for him and makes up the time at night.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s looking over me and micromanaging me.\u201d\n\nRED Group, a New Orleans-based maker of industrial control systems, began allowing somewhat variable schedules several years ago, and last month shifted to total flexibility, says company President Kyle Remont. Making the change possible were benchmarks for the cost and time of each project and software that shows precisely the percentage completed at any moment, as well as a video chat app.\n\n\u201cThe biggest positive is employee morale,\u201d Remont says.\n\nCLOSE A record number of millennials are quitting their jobs, because they don\u2019t want to be tied down, which essentially clears their schedule for more vacation time.
