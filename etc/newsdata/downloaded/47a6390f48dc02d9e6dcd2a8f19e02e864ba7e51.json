With our law, filed at the end of the last legislature but not yet tabled, we ask that there be regular entry channels, we want to reconcile supply and demand for labor.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is urgent to regularize and integrate foreigners, I am not talking about amnesty, obviously,\u201d Mr. Magi said. \u201cPeople are chasing after the specter of Soros and do not see what the real anti-democratic forces in Italy are.\u201d\n\n\u201cSalvini had said that in 5 years he would have repatriated 500,000 irregular immigrants: in fact, in just one year he repatriated only 5,000,\u201d Magi added. \u201cSo what do we want to do? Why not regularize anybody who has an employer ready to hire him?\u201d\n\nThe MEP said he was proud to receive funding from Soros, insisting that it is much better than being friends with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\n\n\u201cMuch better to receive support from Soros than to be friends with Orb\u00e1n,\u201d Magi said.\n\n\u201cI fully acknowledge the financing received, it is a point of pride,\u201d he said. \u201cOthers, like the League, seem to have benefited from clandestine funds from Russian emissaries. Ours was an operation in the light of the day; it\u2019s all accounted for.\u201d\n\nDespite the enormity of the sums received by the radicals, the financing represents just a fraction of Soros\u2019 investments for immigration in Italy.\n\nIn just one year (2017-2018), the leftist disrupter gave a total of $8.5 million to political parties, associations, and NGO\u2019s operating in Italy to advance his immigration agenda, reports state.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The Italian Radicals have confirmed that their party received $298,000 from George Soros in 2017 to promote international immigration.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
