Laia was then diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a type of tumor that starts in the brain stem and is difficult to treat.\n\nThe most common symptoms of DIPG include problems with balance and walking, issues with the eyes, problems chewing and swallowing, nausea and vomiting, morning headache, facial weakness or drooping. The primary treatment for DIPG, which Laia will begin on Oct. 1, is radiation therapy. Chemotherapy may also be used alongside radiation, but surgery is rarely an option because of the tumor\u2019s sensitive location.\n\nThere is no cure for DIPG, and survival rates remain very low, according to St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital. Jenkins told SWNS that Laia has been given between nine months and year to live with treatment.\n\n10 OVERDOSE DEATHS IN OHIO COUNTY IN 26-HOUR PERIOD, CORONER SAYS\n\n\u201cWe are still trying to come to terms with it, trying to understand it, watching our wee lassie getting worse,\u201d he told the news outlet. \u201cAfter the radiotherapy, she might get better for a while as well. We\u2019ve been told with treatment it will be about 12 months, without treatment it will be between three to six months. We\u2019ve been through panic, anger, and helplessness.\u201d\n\nBut the family has decided to live out Laia\u2019s best days doing things she has dreamed of doing, including riding a pony and taking a trip to Disney in Orlando. More than 400 people have donated to a fundraising page to help her bucket list items, and Jenkins said many others have reached out with offers to help.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, I honestly can\u2019t believe it,\u201d he told SWNS. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to put into words how much I appreciate what people have done for us. They made us hopeful and that has been passed on to Laia \u2013 it\u2019s had such a good impact already. It\u2019s got us in a positive mood and we can see that\u2019s having an impact on Laia.
