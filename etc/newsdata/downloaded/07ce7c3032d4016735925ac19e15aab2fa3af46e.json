When navigating through posts, you are not simply looking at the pictures and videos people shared \u2013 they're also looking at you, looking at their posts.\n\nWhen someone posts an Instagram story, they can see a full list of the accounts that have viewed that story. Since it is not possible to look at stories unless a user is logged in, there is no way to see any post without being logged in.\n\nWhat's more, those stories can be locked down, ensuring that only specific people can see them. If an account is private \u2013 as Rooney says hers was \u2013 then someone has to request to follow it; that means that only approved people can see stories or feed posts on a private account.\n\nOnce someone is following an account \u2013 whether it is private or public \u2013 people can also be blocked from seeing posts on a story. That means that people must be approved and also not blocked to see a post, which can be used to give very precise control over who is looking at Instagram stories.\n\nRooney says she used this feature to find out who had been taking information from her posts. She says that she uploaded stories but restricted them so that they could only be seen by one specific account \u2013 Vardy's, she claims \u2013 allowing her to know where any information had come from.\n\nWhat's more, despite the fact that Instagram is unusually transparent about who has been interacting with stories, it importantly does not tell people who else has been viewing a story. That means there is no way to know if you are the only person who has seen a specific post, and therefore no way to know if only you know certain information.\n\nIn short, there are three particular features of Instagram that make such a claim possible. It allows you to shut down your account so that only approved people can see it; it lets you see who viewed your stories; and you can block specific people from doing so.\n\nWhen combined, those three settings can be used as a powerful trick to allow people to see information without knowing that only they are seeing it.\n\nIt is rare that this will be used to work out who is passing on personal information to newspapers. But it could expose people in a variety of other, more pedestrian ways \u2013 and do so without the person using it even knowing.\n\nSimilar features do exist on other platforms. Snapchat, which had the stories features before Instagram, also allows people to see who has been looking at their stories, and even when someone screengrabs one; LinkedIn informs users when somebody has been looking at their profile.", "description": "Coleen Rooney has claimed that Rebekah Vardy was watching her Instagram stories and secretly passing them on to newspapers.
