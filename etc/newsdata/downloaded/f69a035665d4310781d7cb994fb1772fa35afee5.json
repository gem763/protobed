(AP) - Justin Herbert isn\u2019t satisfied yet but he\u2019s confident that the Ducks are on the right path.\n\nThe senior quarterback threw for 316 yards and five touchdowns in No. 15 Oregon\u2019s 35-3 victory Saturday night over Montana, the Ducks\u2019 final tuneup before opening Pac-12 play at Stanford next week.\n\nJacob Breeland and Johnny Johnson III each caught a pair of touchdowns for the Ducks (2-1), who won their 25th straight nonconference game at Autzen Stadium.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve been doing some good things and definitely some stuff we can learn and fix, but I like the direction we\u2019re going in and I like the guys who\u2019ve stepped up and made plays,\u201d Herbert said.\n\nHerbert has thrown for a touchdown in 31 straight games, the longest current streak in the nation. It was his fifth career five-touchdown game, most by an Oregon quarterback. Marcus Mariota had four.\n\nFifth-year senior Dalton Sneed threw for 184 yards for FCS-level Montana (2-1), which avoided its first shutout since 1988 with Brandon Purdy\u2019s 25-yard field goal late in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cWe need to get better. We lost,\u201d Montana coach Bobby Hauck said when asked what his team can take away from the game. \u201cWe came here to win, and we didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nOregon was coming off a 77-6 rout of Nevada that helped get the team back on track after a disappointing loss to Auburn in the season opener. Herbert also threw five TDs against the Wolf Pack and now has 11 for the season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a real brotherhood this year, and you know it\u2019s a real family on this team and I think he (Herbert) knows that and he\u2019s a big part of this family and we all look up to him,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nMontana opened the season with wins over South Dakota and North Alabama, climbing into the STATS FCS Top 25 at No. 20. The Ducks are the second-highest ranked team the Grizzlies have faced in the modern era after a 63-7 loss to No. 7 Washington two years ago.\n\nMontana senior receiver Jerry Louie-McGee caught six passes for 66 yards. He went into the game needing just three catches to break Raul Pacheco\u2019s career record of 192 set in 1998.\n\nHerbert made his first 10 passes of the game for 113 yards and two scores, both to Breeland.\n\nOregon scored on its first drive when Herbert connected with Breeland on a 5-yard touchdown pass. Ducks linebacker Mase Funa ended Montana\u2019s opening drive when he sacked Sneed. Funa, a true freshman, went into the game with four tackles for loss to lead the Pac-12.\n\nBreeland caught a 17-yard scoring pass before the first quarter was over to make it 14-0.\n\nAs time wound down in the half, Herbert\u2019s pass on a fourth-and-1 attempt was incomplete, giving the ball to the Grizzlies on their own 45. But the drive ended when Brandon Purdy\u2019s 50-yard field goal attempt was short.\n\nWith 10 seconds left, Herbert shook off a defender for an 18-yard pass to a diving Johnson in the end zone, sending the Ducks into the break with a 21-0 lead.\n\n\u201cIt shows how strong he is at 240 pounds, I thought he was wrapped up, the whole stadium thought he was wrapped up,\u201d Oregon coach Mario Cristobal said about Herbert\u2019s evasiveness. \u201cHe found a way to shake out of that and show how strong he really is.\u201d\n\nHerbert found Johnson with a 1-yard TD pass in the third quarter, before a 10-yard scoring pass early in the fourth to Jaylon Redd.\n\nOregon was without graduate transfer Juwan Johnson for the third straight game because of a leg injury. Johnson was expected to be one of Herbert\u2019s top targets this season.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMontana: The Grizzlies will make $650,000 for the visit to Eugene. Hauck was asked about those guarantee games during his Monday news conference. \u2026 Montana had scored 92 points in its first two games. \u2026 Sneed, who started his career at UNLV, was the Big Sky\u2019s newcomer of the year last season, when he led the Grizzlies in both passing and rushing. He threw for 2,723 yards and 22 touchdowns while rushing for 675 yards and two more scores.\n\nOregon: Travis Dye led Oregon\u2019s rushers with 17 carries for 101 yards. \u2026 The Ducks now lead the series 8-0-1 with all the games played in Eugene. The closest the Grizzlies came was a 14-all tie in 1952. \u2026 Oregon senior point guard Peyton Pritchard announced the Ducks\u2019 starters before the game.\n\nSMOOTH OPERATOR: Hauck, who has a connection to the Herbert family, had high praise for the senior quarterback.\n\n\u201cHis dad went to Montana for a couple of years. Mark was at Montana when we were there. I think he was a sophomore when I was a freshman,\u201d Hauck said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good player. You guys know, I talked about him all week. I had high regard for him before the game. I just think he\u2019s a smooth operator.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nMontana: The Grizzlies host Monmouth of the FCS-level Big South Conference on Saturday.\n\nOregon: The Ducks open league play on Saturday at Stanford, which lost 45-27 to No. 17 UCF this weekend.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Justin Herbert isn't satisfied yet but he's confident that the Ducks are on the right path.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
