Vedanta is still trying even to get access to the smelter to check its current state.\n\nCodelco, meanwhile, has been upgrading its smelters to meet new Chilean environmental standards and is considering closing the Ventanas smelter rather than investing in further measures to meet the next round of yet tougher regulations.\n\nThe ICSG's biannual forecasts are always beholden to events, as the Group itself concedes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut rarely has there been such uncertainty in every component of its calculations.\n\nCopper mine supply has a history of unpredictability but refined metal production has tended to be much more stable in the past. The scale of disruption at this stage of the supply chain is near unprecedented, instilling an extra element of volatility into the bigger supply picture.\n\nThe demand outlook, meanwhile, is dependent on the two imponderables of Chinese stimulus, surprisingly metals \"lite\" so far, and the on-off Sino-US trade talks.\n\nGenerating a hard market balance estimate is particularly tricky right now.\n\nAnd it looks as if it's going to remain tricky for the foreseeable future, given the number of unknowns in the mix.\n\nThe copper market has spent the last few months trying to work out whether it should be trading deteriorating demand prospects or bullish supply-side underperformance.\n\nThe ICSG's assessment of the current state of play suggests Doctor Copper's confusion will not lift any time soon.\n\nReuters", "description": "Global consumption is now expected to register anaemic growth of just 0.3 per cent this year.
