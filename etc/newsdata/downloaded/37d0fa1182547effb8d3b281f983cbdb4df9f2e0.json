Donna J. Harrison, executive director of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists; Mike Chupp, CEO of Christian Medical Dental Association; and Michelle Cretella, executive director of American College of Pediatricians said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nThe statement comes a week after officials with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Physicians for Reproductive Health \u2014 both supporters of abortion rights \u2014 declared in a Sept. 25 statement that abortions \u201ccan be medically necessary,\u201d citing complications such as renal and cardiac failure that necessitate terminating a pregnancy.\n\n\u201cAs physicians, we are focused on protecting the health and lives of the patients for whom we provide care. Without question, abortion can be medically necessary,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nThe medical conflict erupted after Facebook this summer removed two videos posted by Live Action, saying the pro-life advocacy group\u2019s claim that abortion is never necessary was misleading.\n\nFacebook also notified Live Action President Lila Rose that her page and any of her links would have \u201creduced distribution and other restrictions because of repeated sharing of false news,\u201d according to a message from Facebook officials to Live Action posted online.\n\nBefore being pulled, the videos made by Ms. Rose \u2014 who is not a medical doctor \u2014 had received 6,000 shares and was trending, according to Facebook\u2019s data.\n\nFacebook\u2019s action evoked public outcry from the pro-life community amid echoed calls that the social media giant is biased against conservatives.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, Missouri Republican, tweeted that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, in a private conversation, admitted there \u201cclearly was bias\u201d in his firm\u2019s editorial decision and promised an internal review.\n\nHowever, on Sept. 27, after an external review of Facebook\u2019s internal fact-checking mechanism, the International Fact-Checking Network \u2014 a Poynter Institute-associated fact-checking organization \u2014 issued a decision that Facebook\u2019s fact-checkers had made the correct decision.\n\n\u201cScience Feedback\u2019s conclusion appears sound and fair, based on the best evidence,\u201d wrote Sarphan Uzunoglu, an assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Lebanese American University.\n\nMr. Uzunoglu \u201chas never taken \u2018pro-choice\u2019 or \u2018pro-life\u2019 advocacy positions,\u201d said the International Fact-Checking Network.\n\nThe initial decision to rule Live Action\u2019s claim on Facebook about the medical necessity of abortions resulted from an audit by two pro-choice obstetricians with Health Feedback, an arm of Science Feedback, the organization Facebook has hired to sort out the truthfulness of claims.\n\nIn their summary, Drs. Daniel Grossman and Robyn Schickler wrote: \u201cPhysicians who evaluated this claim found it to be inaccurate.\u201d\n\nHowever, at that time, Dr. Grossman had served on the board of directors of NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation and Dr. Schickler was affiliated with Physicians for Reproductive Health (PRH).\n\nIn his assessment, Mr. Uzunoglu also wrote that Science Feedback\u2019s decision to use two doctors with pro-choice ties to vet a pro-life group\u2019s messaging \u201cshows no evidence of bias in the selection process.\u201d\n\nInternational Fact-Checking Network officials faulted Science Feedback for not initially identifying the affiliations of Drs. Grossman and Schickler, saying such lack of transparency \u201cfell short of the standards required of IFCN signatories.\u201d But the network said the information used to call Ms. Rose\u2019s claim false was \u201cbased on publicly available scientific evidence.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the pro-life doctors pointed out that 85% of OB/GYNs do not perform abortions and called ACOG\u2019s pro-choice advocacy \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are glad that ACOG and PRH leadership recognize what all pro-life obstetricians know \u2014 that sometimes treatments which result in the separation of the mother and the baby are necessary to save the mother\u2019s life,\u201d said Drs. Harrison, Chupp and Cretella. \u201cHowever, ACOG and PRH leadership disingenuously imply in their statement that these life saving procedures are the same as elective abortions.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
