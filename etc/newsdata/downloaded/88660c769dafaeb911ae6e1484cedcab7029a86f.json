The Mercedes driver insisted Leclerc, who took his second win for Ferrari at Monza, had deserved the success but also said he may speak to the Monegasque driver in private about what had happened on track.\n\nFerrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc delights Italian F1 GP crowd with Monza win Read more\n\nLeclerc took the win after the two drivers had enjoyed a long battle. It had come to a head at the Roggia chicane where Hamilton looked to pass but Leclerc squeezed him wide. Hamilton believed he had not been left a car\u2019s width of space as the regulations require but Leclerc was issued only with a warning. Hamilton said that had he not ceded the position they would have clashed and specifically referenced the car\u2019s width regulation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just constantly asked for consistency,\u201d said Hamilton of the stewards. \u201cThere was a rule put in place, and then it wasn\u2019t abided by today. They used different consequences for the rule today. I don\u2019t know why that was the case. I guess the stewards woke up on a different side of the bed this morning, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Charles Leclerc\u2019s Ferrari leads Lewis Hamilton\u2019s Mercedes during the F1 Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

At Spielberg Verstappen passed him up the inside, making contact, forcing Leclerc wide and he lost the place. After a long inquiry Verstappen\u2019s move and win were allowed to stand.\n\nJackie Stewart\u2019s glorious 1969: \u2018I had a fantastic team around me\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cI think since Austria it is clear you can go a bit further in the way we defend and overtake and the aggressiveness of us drivers,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that Austria helped me to change this approach and today, it\u2019s also thanks to this that I managed to win. It was obviously very on the limit but I\u2019m happy to race like this.\u201d\n\nHamilton in turn noted that he too would adjust his decision-making accordingly now he had been on the receiving end but insisted there was no lack of respect between him and the 21-year-old.\n\n\u201cHe did a fantastic job today. I put on as much pressure as I could,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a couple of close moments, I think we can probably talk about it in private together, but there\u2019s nothing major, and we continue to race. I\u2019m looking forward to more races together.\u201d", "description": "Lewis Hamilton, whose car was squeezed by Charles Leclerc\u2019s Ferrari at Monza, claimed stewards had not followed the rules", "authors": ["Giles Richards"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d707e2a0e292afc8f103d20a8a6cd0494e82b4d9/0_63_2673_1604/master/2673.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e35d5ec098b7560db8485ffe198765eb", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
