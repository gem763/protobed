Sayoc Jr., the fervent supporter of President Trump who rattled the nation last fall when he sent homemade pipe bombs to former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other prominent Democrats, was sentenced on Monday to 20 years in prison .\n\nMr. Sayoc pleaded guilty in March to mailing 16 bombs to people he considered to be Mr. Trump\u2019s enemies. The F.B.I. said the devices were packed with powder from fireworks, fertilizer, a pool chemical and glass fragments that would function as shrapnel, but they would not have worked as designed.\n\nIn the end, the flaws in the bombs\u2019 design were critical to a federal judge\u2019s decision to give Mr. Sayoc 20 years in prison rather than the life sentence prosecutors requested. The judge, Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan, said he had concluded that Mr. Sayoc, though no firearms expert, was capable of concocting a pipe bomb that could explode and had consciously chosen not to.\n\n\u201cHe hated his victims,\u201d the judge said. \u201cHe wished them no good, but he was not so lost as to wish them dead, at least not by his own hand.\u201d", "description": "Mr. Sayoc sent the bombs to prominent Democrats, setting off a frenzied investigation that unnerved the country before last year\u2019s midterm elections.", "authors": ["Benjamin Weiser", "Ali Watkins"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/06/us/06sayoc2-print/00sayoc-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-05"}
