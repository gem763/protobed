Strategists are saying profits for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 SPX, +1.05% stock index will be down about 4% \u2014 not enough to push the U.S. into a recession, but enough to keep questions alive about whether the economy will generate much growth.\n\nSo what\u2019s going to happen, and what should small investors do about it? That\u2019s the question up and down Wall Street this week.\n\nFirst off, a quick note on Wall Street and its ways.\n\nIf history is prologue, earnings will slightly beat current expectations \u2014 the typical pattern is that estimates for a given quarter or year start out too high, get revised lower until they are a little too low right before the news hits, and then the actual news is slightly better.\n\nA grain of salt\n\nThe corollary to this is that investors should also take projections that corporate profits will rise 10% in 2020 with a grain of salt, CFRA Research strategist Sam Stovall says.\n\n\u201cAnalysts are usually too optimistic in year-ahead estimates,\u201d Stovall said in an email. Since 2000, \u201canalysts overestimate [the following year\u2019s profit gains] by an average of 5.2%\u201d\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s JPM, +4.39% results were pretty good \u2014 an 8% profit gain to $9.08 billion, or $2.68 a share, beating forecasts by 23 cents a share, that made the stock climb 2% in early trading. But nearly flat loan growth keeps prospects muted: CEO Jamie Dimon said \u201chealthy\u201d consumer finances are being partly offset by \u201cweakening business sentiment and investment\u201d \u2014 meaning that he sees the same economy everyone else does.\n\nThe outlook is the same as it has been \u2014 growth is slowing, but a recession isn\u2019t in view yet, notwithstanding some outlier pundits who think the recent manufacturing slowdown has too much momentum not to spill over into the broader economy.\n\nMark Hulbert: This transportation indicator is far more upbeat than the Dow Transports\n\nWe\u2019ve all been though the speculation that an \u201cearnings recession\u201d \u2014 two straight quarters of year-over-year earnings declines \u2014 will lead to a real recession, but so far earnings have stayed barely above 2018 and forecasts call for them to move back into positive territory by the fourth quarter.\n\nAlso read: Eroding profit margins will push U.S. into recession in 2020, leading forecaster says\n\nWhat that means is the subject of a disagreement this week between Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, two of Wall Street\u2019s biggest and most respected investment banks.\n\nGoldman pushes growth\n\nGoldman argues that the slow-but-fairly-steady growth of the economy means that investors should be focused on growth stocks, in information technology and elsewhere.\n\nStocks with higher profit growth rates tend to be more expensive \u2014 that is, to trade at higher multiples of their projected (in this case, 2020) profits \u2014 but growth stocks have risen 77 percentage points more than value stocks throughout the long recovery from 2008\u2019s financial crisis.\n\nThe reason is really simple, Goldman strategists led by David Kostin say: In a slow-growth economy, companies that can boost profits rapidly are rare, so people pay up for them.\n\n\u201cDuring the last 35 years, stable growth stocks have outperformed during times of economic policy uncertainty,\u201d Kostin\u2019s team writes. \u201cIf uncertainty remains elevated ahead of next year\u2019s U.S. elections, investors will likely continue to reward the stocks with the most stable historical earnings growth.\u201d .\n\nThe trick of betting on growth is that high valuations can be volatile, Kostin\u2019s team says. As the economy slows, from last year\u2019s 2.9% growth rate to the 2.3% Goldman predicts for this year and 2.1% next year, markets tend to beat up companies whose earnings growth is more volatile.\n\nAn Apple AAPL, +0.02% that has a soft quarter in China, for example, which happened during the manufacturing-led slowdown of 2015-2016, get beaten up at times like that.\n\nThat leads Goldman to push its clients now toward growth companies that have been more stable over time, even though they are 23% more expensive, as a group, than the market, Kostin said. In tech, that points Goldman toward Alphabet GOOG, +1.84% and a raft of payment-processing companies, led by Fiserv FISV, +0.17% and Amdocs DOX, +0.84% .\n\nBig retailers like Walmart WMT, -0.04% and Home Depot HD, +0.57% and brands like McDonalds MCD, -0.88% and Domino\u2019s Pizza DPZ, +0.99% pass Goldman\u2019s earnings-stability screen but are more expensive.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s caution\n\nThat\u2019s not how it looks to Morgan Stanley\u2019s Michael Wilson, though. \u201cOverpaying for growth remains the biggest risk,\u201d he wrote on Monday.\n\nWilson\u2019s take on the economy is that last year\u2019s near-3% growth was a mirage purchased by the 2017 tax cut. The gusher of money caused small excesses, or bubbles, in corporate investment and inventory building that needed to be offset by slower growth this year, he said, a pattern that shows up especially in slow inventory growth the last two quarters.\n\nHe thinks this payback is not near its end.\n\nThis means profit growth is likely to be near zero for the next 12 months, Wilson said. And that means the premium people have been paying for growth is untenable, he argues.\n\nThat leads Wilson to a different list of stock picks than Kostin\u2019s.\n\nHis top pick in tech is Microsoft MSFT, +1.34% , a stock this column called (correctly, for now) the best of the FAANG stocks in July 2018 for much the same reasons \u2014 modest price combined with a secular opportunity in corporate America\u2019s shift to cloud-based computing.\n\nHe also tabs Walt Disney DIS, +0.05% (also on Kostin\u2019s screen), Procter & Gamble PG, -2.50%, and insurance company Progressive PGR, -0.28% .\n\nFor most small investors, the game is more about selecting mutual funds than stocks. And even there, the signals are mixed, since the best performing sector funds this year are in technology, which is a growth-dominated area, and real estate, a value bastion.\n\nAnd for most investors, it means looking past the immediate problems of right now. This week\u2019s trade disputes and earnings reports will be in the rearview mirror soon enough.", "description": "Corporate earnings are expected to drop, so what should small investors do about it?", "authors": ["Tim Mullaney"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT321_corpea_ZG_20191015105333.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
