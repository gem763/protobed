They will be met by thousands of protesters, according to reports from local news organizations \u2014 plus multiple law enforcement agencies determined to keep the peace for one and all.\n\n\u201cMinneapolis is bracing for a chaotic scene, with President Trump set to speak Thursday in the heart of the city that overwhelmingly rejected him in 2016. Two dozen disparate groups plan to protest the visit, from civil rights advocates to labor unions and self-identifying antifa or anti-capitalists. Some estimate more than 10,000 people will flood downtown to oppose the president\u2019s visit,\u201d said the Minneapolis Star Tribune on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThey will be confronted by counterdemonstrators supporting the president, some of whom follow him across the country such as Bikers for Trump, along with the Minnesota-based Three Percenters militia. That\u2019s in addition to the Trump fans who plan to jam the 19,000-seat Target Center,\u201d the Star Tribune reported.\n\nLt. Larry Elder, spokesman for the Minneapolis police, said his force will have the help of the Hennepin County Sheriff\u2019s Office, University of Minnesota police, Metro Transit police and the State Patrol, as well as local and federal law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and Secret Service.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Trump has feuded with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey over the costs of the event; both have traded hostile tweets. Mr. Trump, however, called Minnesota a \u201cgreat state\u201d during an appearance at the White House on Wednesday, and predicted the rally will be \u201ca lot of fun\u201d\n\nBut some things don\u2019t change. The president\u2019s devoted fans have been assembling outside the arena since Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMore than 48 hours before the rally was scheduled to start, President Trump\u2019s supporters began lining up outside the arena,\u201d said Minnesota Public Radio. \u201cAmong the first in line was Dan Nelson, an engineer from Spring Lake Park, Minn. hoping to get a front-row seat. He wants to show the president how much he appreciates Trump\u2019s tax and economic policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy company went from stagnant to growing and from no bonus to bonus. With the tax cuts alone, my check has gone up,\u201d Mr. Nelson told the news organization.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
