Hoover also made it to the World Series in 1929, 1930 and 1931, each time to watch the Athletics in Philadelphia.\n\nAD\n\nAs told by the White House Historical Association, Hoover\u2019s final trip to Shibe Park in 1931 occurred during the worst of the Great Depression, yet Hoover felt the need to make an appearance at the game as \u201ca gesture of reassurance to a country suffering from a severe attack of \u2018jitters,\u2019 \u201d he noted in his memoirs. Those jitters manifested themselves when Hoover got up to leave and was met with \u201ca resounding chorus of boos \u2026 the president of the United States was accorded the bird, or razzberry,\u201d according to an account in the Cleveland Plain-Dealer. Thirsty fans suffering through Prohibition also chanted \u201cWe want beer\u201d at the president.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPerhaps Philadelphia is tired of whiskey and gin,\u201d Westbrook Pegler wrote in the Arkansas Gazette.\n\nNearly 20 years later, in 1951, President Harry S. Truman was jeered on Opening Day at Griffith Stadium in Washington, receiving \u201clight scattered applause mixed with boos\u201d as he entered the stadium ahead of the Senators-Yankees game, the New York Times wrote. Then, in the eighth inning, \u201cthe crowd booed lustily when an announcement came over the public address system requesting all persons to remain in their seats until President Truman and his official party had left the stadium.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounded more like the razzing that usually greets the appearance of Boston\u2019s Ted Williams at the plate, however, than real anger,\u201d The Post\u2019s Murrey Marder observed in the paper\u2019s front-page story.\n\nAD\n\nThe Washington Evening Star called it \u201cthe coldest reception ever given a Chief Executive at an opening ball game,\u201d and one Truman probably saw coming: The game was the president\u2019s first public event after he removed Douglas MacArthur as commander of United Nations forces in Korea and took place one day after MacArthur had given his \u201cold soldiers never die; they just fade away\u201d speech in front of a joint session of Congress. Truman\u2019s removal of MacArthur was massively unpopular, with Sen. Robert A. Taft calling for immediate impeachment hearings and Truman\u2019s approval rating falling to just 23 percent in the middle of the year, lower than Richard Nixon\u2019s approval rating during Watergate.\n\nAD\n\nIndeed, Marder noted that one woman called out \u201cWhere\u2019s MacArthur?\u201d as Truman said goodbye to Senators owner Clark Griffith.\n\n\u201cA member of the President\u2019s party said he was not surprised that part of a baseball crowd, accustomed to expressing vigorous pleasure or displeasure, had booed in such circumstances,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s approval rating has not fluctuated much over his term, averaging out to about 39 percent since April 2017, according to Washington Post-ABC News polling.\n\nLatter-era presidents have not been immune from razzing. President George H.W. Bush was booed when he was introduced at the 1992 All-Star Game in San Diego:\n\nHis son, George W. Bush, got the Bronx cheer when he threw out the first pitch at the first game at Nationals Park in 2008:\n\nAnd there were a few boos when President Barack Obama threw out the first pitch at the 2009 All-Star Game in St. Louis:\n\nAD\n\nRead more on the World Series:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "Trump isn't alone in getting the Bronx cheer.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bYpBDhjZSGdctMGuDzbgb9oEE8E=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HSMK3SHZHEI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
