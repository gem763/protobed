Or, in this case, liberating Britain from the European Union.\n\nOn Monday, British members of Parliament were denied the chance, yet again, to vote on the new exit deal Prime Minister Boris Johnson clinched from Brussels\u2019 jaws.\n\nThe debate on the bill, scheduled to commence Tuesday, is now subject to a more complex, lengthy timetable, further risking Britain\u2019s opportunity to leave the EU by the end of the month. The loser in all this is democracy itself.\n\nPoll after poll shows that Britons are sick of more delays. They are tired of politicians endlessly debating Brexit. Much like the 2016 election in the United States, Brexit has torn family and friends asunder, and there is a strong desire for tensions to ease.\n\nBut Brexit has also become a matter of trust between the public and the Parliament that represents it. If the outcome of the 2016 referendum, in which a clear majority voted for Brexit, isn\u2019t respected, faith in future votes will be jeopardized.\n\nThe failure to deliver Brexit can largely be blamed on the dithering of many British members of Parliament, who are using every underhanded trick to stop the process. In truth, plenty of them don\u2019t want \u00adBrexit to happen at all. They imagined they would never have to cast a vote, assuming a reworked deal would never land on their desks.\n\nDefying great odds, however, Johnson brought home at the 11th hour a deal that grants Britain full trade and regulatory \u00adindependence. The deal also addresses Northern Ireland\u2019s delicate situation with a bespoke arrangement, giving the country the power to determine its own future arrangements with the European Union.\n\nMPs met on Saturday \u2014 the first time parliamentarians had gathered on a weekend since the Falklands War. They had the opportunity to make history, by voting to deliver Brexit for the British people.\n\nYet through a series of complex machinations, the Brexit naysayers forced the prime minister to ask Brussels for yet another extension \u2014 the third since the referendum \u2014 in a clear attempt to thwart Britain\u2019s exit once more.\n\nThese MPs threaten not only the public\u2019s faith in democracy, but also the big opportunities created by Brexit, including Britain\u2019s ability to venture out globally and secure its own free-trade deals with other countries, freed from the Brussels mandarins\u2019 yoke.\n\nThere has already been a great deal of interest from other, non-European countries to trade more freely with Britain. That interest has resulted in more than a dozen \u201ctrade-continuity agreements,\u201d covering more than 45 countries, which can come into effect once Britain exits.\n\nAnd the big prize, a US-UK free-trade deal, presents a huge opportunity on both sides of the Atlantic to boost growth and slash prices for consumers.\n\nAmerica is Britain\u2019s largest export market as a single country, and relationships are only improving. Exports from Britain to the United States already amount to nearly half of those to the European Union, having grown 33% over the last four years, compared with a 22% rise in UK exports to the EU. Then, too, Britain is already the single largest investor in the US economy, and vice versa.\n\nWho stands to win? Consumers in both countries: Britons buying California wine, for example, and Americans buying British fashion. Plus, the growth potential in financial services and technology industries should excite established business and entrepreneurs alike. Right now, the bureaucrats and vested interests are holding all this hostage.\n\nThe Brexit saga has already been subject to many false endings, and this week may prove no different. But if a Brexit deal is voted through, it will be a resounding win for democracy. The British people can\u2019t wait to get Brexit over the line, but there\u2019s plenty of reason for those watching from across the Atlantic to cheer its success, too. Here\u2019s hoping this story finds a happy ending.\n\nKate Andrews is associate director at the Institute of Economic Affairs, a free-market think tank in London.
