It was the first time tech was discussed meaningfully on the Democratic debate stage \u2014 and a sign that the media sees the growing techlash as enough of a concern that candidates should be pressed on it on national television.\n\nThe combat mostly centered on Elizabeth Warren, the new presidential frontrunner who has made her proposal to break up tech companies like Facebook a cornerstone of her presidential run. Many of her competitors said they were not willing to go as far as her, although several decided to take their own whacks at Silicon Valley from other angles.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke offered the most direct criticism to Warren\u2019s plan, even comparing her approach to Trump\u2019s rhetoric about the press.\n\n\u201cWe will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that \u2014 but I don\u2019t think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that Donald Trump has done in part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power. It\u2019s not something that we should do.\u201d\n\nAndrew Yang, the political neophyte running on tech-infused themes such as universal basic income, said Warren was correct in diagnosing the problem but that \u201cusing a 20th century antitrust framework will not work.\u201d\n\nCory Booker would only say that his administration would \u201cput people in place that enforce antitrust laws\u201d but declined to sign on to the proposal to break up the tech giants. He did use some of the harshest language on the stage, saying that tech companies were responsible for a \u201cmassive crisis on our democracy.\u201d\n\nTom Steyer, a San Francisco billionaire in his own right, indicated some openness to the idea that monopolies have to \u201cbe broken up or regulated\u201d \u2014 but didn\u2019t offer specifics about tech companies. The same went for Bernie Sanders, who also declined to address tech altogether, instead lamenting the consolidation of power across sectors from agriculture to media.\n\nAmy Klobuchar pushed her proposals to bolster enforcement agencies to more ably promote competition. And Juli\u00e1n Castro criticized \u201cmonopolistic trade practices\u201d by companies like Amazon.\n\nBut the most fiery back and forth came when Kamala Harris, a senator who represents tech companies from California, tried to outflank Warren on how she would hold Big Tech accountable. She shifted from the antitrust question and instead tried to press Warren on why she would not call for Twitter to ban Trump from the platform.\n\nWarren largely declined to engage on that terrain \u2014 which led to a messy exchange that showcased two candidates largely talking past one another.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House,\u201d Warren said.\n\n\u201cJoin me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down,\u201d Harris interrupted.\n\nWarren didn\u2019t clearly say one way or another what her stance on Trump\u2019s Twitter account was \u2014 mostly ignoring Harris\u2019s attempts to interject. (Warren at one point said that \u201call the rules should apply across the board.\u201d) Warren instead tried to talk primarily about her new promise to not take money from tech executives, an implicit shot at candidates such as Harris, who has enjoyed substantial support from tech companies, which also employ several of her family members.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to talk seriously about breaking up Big Tech, then we should ask if people are taking money from the Big Tech executives.\u201d\n\nDemocrats may have been attacking tech from wildly different angles, but it couldn\u2019t be lost on anyone that during the 15 minutes of debate, not one of them said anything even remotely positive about an industry so closely assigned with the Democratic Party just a few years ago.", "description": "Democrats running for president had their most vigorous debate yet about the power of tech companies.", "authors": ["Theodore Schleifer", "Peter Kafka", "Alex Ward", "German Lopez", "Emily Todd Vanderwerff", "Anna North", "Emily Stewart", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mt8FQS7iLFPNmtEpQWiLpKlLACI=/0x308:4288x2553/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19291442/1181330651.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
