So who's running and what are their strengths and weaknesses?\n\nThis field of candidates promises to be the most diverse yet. It already has the most women running in US history.\n\nThe BBC's Anthony Zurcher casts his eye over all 23 of them.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWho? Former vice-president and veteran senator\n\nKey issues: Rebuilding the middle class; investing in federal infrastructure; tuition-free public universities\n\nOne policy: Similar to the Green New Deal, Biden's Clean Energy Revolution would make the US economy 100% clean energy based with net-zero emissions by 2050, as well as target polluters with fees and quotas\n\nAnthony's take: Joe Biden enters the Democratic presidential contest as a front-runner, if not the front-runner. He has near universal name recognition, high approval ratings within the party and among political independents, a close connection to the halcyon days (at least, for Democrats) of the Obama presidency, and the potential to raise vast amounts of campaign money through traditional Democratic donor networks.\n\nOf course, so did Hillary Clinton in 2015 - and we all know how that turned out.\n\nLike the former secretary of state, Mr Biden in his launch video seems to be defining himself as much by who he isn't - Donald Trump - as what he wants to do. It was a oft-criticised strategy for Mrs Clinton in 2016, but with two years of the Trump presidency in the books, Mr Biden seems to be betting that a majority of Americans who have now seen Trumpism in practice have had enough.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Joe Biden: Will it be third time lucky in 2020?\n\nMr Biden shares some of the political weaknesses demonstrated in Mrs Clinton's presidential race as well. Her lengthy time in the public eye left a long record for her opponents to pick apart, and bound her to a status quo establishment many Americans had come to distrust.\n\nExpect the former vice-president's position against school bussing to end segregation in the 1970s, his chairmanship of the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 1991, and his support for the 2003 Iraq War and stringent anti-crime and bankruptcy bills to be spotlighted by the diverse and talented primary field opposing him.\n\nThen there's his advanced age, propensity for verbal stumbles, allegations of inappropriate physical contact and status as a two-time loser in past White House bids.\n\nThe former vice-president has a lot going for him. He also has a lot going against him. The durability of his campaign is one of the big questions hovering over the early days of the 2020 Democratic race. Those questions will soon be answered.\n\nWhat Trump has said: \"Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe. I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign.\"\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nWho? The 2016 runner-up needs no introduction\n\nKey issues: Medicare-for-All universal healthcare coverage; raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans; upping the minimum wage\n\nOne policy: Completely eliminating $1.6tn in existing student debt - regardless of income, unlike his rival Elizabeth Warren - and making public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free by taxing Wall Street\n\nAnthony's take: After building a grassroots political movement that roiled the Democratic Party in 2016, Bernie Sanders is making another run at the prize.\n\nThis time, he won't be the rumpled underdog. He'll start the race near the front of the pack - with advantages in small-donor fundraising, name recognition and a 50-state organisation of loyalists.\n\nHis front-runner status will come with a price, however. Unlike 2016, when Hillary Clinton largely avoided confronting the Vermont senator for fear of alienating his supporters, his opponents will have no such reluctance this time.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIn 2016, the self-proclaimed \"Democratic socialist\" staked out a progressive agenda in contrast with Ms Clinton's pragmatic centrism. Now, in part because of Mr Sanders' efforts, the party has moved left on issues like healthcare, education and income inequality. His message is no longer unique.\n\nThe 77-year-old senator will keep his devoted base, but will some former supporters opt for a fresh face? That could lead to conflict with those who believe a Bernie \"revolution\" is the only way forward, inflaming Democratic wounds not fully healed from the last campaign.\n\nIn a crowded field, Mr Sanders has a realistic shot - but it could be a bumpy ride.\n\nWhat has Trump said? \"Bernie is crazy, but Bernie has got a lot more energy than Biden, so you never know.\"\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nWho? Another senator, this time from Massachusetts, a thorn in the side of big banks\n\nKey issues: Wealth tax; healthcare and abortion rights; criminalising corporate negligence\n\nOne policy: Erasing college debt based on income level - households earning under $250,000 annually would receive varying levels of debt relief while those earning more would not - and making public college tuition-free, paid for by taxes on wealth\n\nAnthony's take: Elizabeth Warren has been a favourite of the progressive left since she emerged on the political scene to push for tougher regulation of the financial sector after the 2008 economic crash. During her time in the US Senate she became known for her hard-nosed interrogations of Wall Street executives and as an outspoken critic of income inequality.\n\nThat loyal base may be enough to rise to the top of a fractured Democratic presidential field.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe challenge for Warren will be expanding her appeal beyond the already converted. She's an academic by training, having spent much of her adult career as a professor. Her campaign, however, is already emphasising her working-class upbringing over her educational pedigree, as a means of connecting her personal story to the activist government policies she supports.\n\nWarren will face the challenge of having to define her candidacy while taking fire from Donald Trump, who has repeatedly disparaged her past claims of native American heritage. Although she hardly mentions the president in speeches these days, she'll have to convince Democrats she won't be only the latest politician the president has belittled - and then defeated.\n\nWhat has Trump said? \"I think Pocahontas, she's finished. She's out. She's gone. When it was found that I had more Indian blood in me than she did, and then it was determined I had none, but I still had more, that was the end of her 32-year scam.\"\n\nBeto O'Rourke\n\nWho? Former congressman in Texas who skateboards and plays guitar\n\nKey issues: Immigration; gun control; prison reform\n\nOne main policy: To reform the justice system, O'Rourke would legalise marijuana, end the use of private, for-profit prisons in the system and eliminate cash bail, which he has said disproportionately affects the poor\n\nAnthony's take: There's something strange about an electoral defeat launching a presidential campaign. But 2020 is shaping up to be a strange election cycle.\n\nBeto O'Rourke captured the imagination of Democrats across America with his energetic, yet ultimately unsuccessful, 2018 bid to unseat Republican Senator Ted Cruz in Texas. He became a social media star, packed rallies across the state and posted fundraising numbers more akin to a presidential contender than a Senate hopeful.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nNow he is a presidential contender. The former congressman from El Paso enters a crowded presidential field, but few of his competitors have matched Mr O'Rourke's star power. Bernie Sanders has his passionate devotees. Kamala Harris pulled 20,000 to her campaign kickoff in Oakland. But Mr O'Rourke has the potential to match them cheer for cheer.\n\nSensible journalists swoon. \"Beto\" attire has been spotted in Brooklyn coffee shops and on the head of basketball star Lebron James. Despite a paper-thin resume, Mr O'Rourke is a rare political phenomenon. The late Texas writer Molly Ivins once observed that a successful presidential candidate has to have \"a little Elvis in him\". Mr O'Rourke has Elvis in spades. Enough Elvis to open a Las Vegas casino.\n\nNow Elvis is going on tour.\n\nWhat has Trump said? \"I've never seen so much hand movement. I said, 'Is he crazy or is that just the way he acts?'\"\n\nCory Booker\n\nWho? Energetic New Jersey senator and gifted speaker\n\nKey issues: Wealth inequality; job guarantee programme; criminal justice reform\n\nOne policy: Booker has proposed \"baby bonds\", where all children would receive a fund with $1,000 at birth that would be added to each year depending on the family's income level\n\nAnthony's take: We've reached the point in the presidential pool party where candidates are no longer dipping their toes in the water, they're shouting \"cannonball\" and hurling themselves in. Cory Booker has rolled out an inspirational-style video and will be hitting the road in Iowa and South Carolina, starting what he hopes is the long road to the Democratic nomination.\n\nIt will be hard to find a more gifted orator in the 2020 Democratic field than the New Jersey senator. He prowls the stage with a restless energy. His sentences are grandiose; he emotes every word.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIf the presidential race were a declamation contest, Mr Booker would head the pack. And even though it's not, he still has a number of advantages. His proximity to New York has made him a prodigious fund-raiser. His background reflects the diversity of the modern Democratic Party. His time as mayor of blue-collar Newark gives him a grounding to the plight of the underprivileged.\n\nMany on the left don't trust him, however. They view his big-money ties as a liability and haven't forgotten his 2012 defence of Republican Mitt Romney's venture-capital background.\n\nIn a crowded field, Mr Booker will be pressed to convince Democratic voters he's the one to take them to the promised land. His silver tongue will get quite a workout.\n\nWhat has Trump said? \"I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.\"\n\nKamala Harris\n\nWho? Senator for California, 54-year-old attorney, mixed race\n\nKey issues: Increasing teacher's pay; gun control; decriminalising sex work\n\nOne policy: Harris says if elected, she would give Congress 100 days to pass gun control measures before taking executive action to enact universal background checks and banning assault weapons\n\nAnthony's take: Kamala Harris is the kind of Democrat who could stick around and prevail in what is sure to be a gruelling nomination battle. She is from California, which is rich in both primary delegates and fundraising dollars. As a woman, and from an ethnic minority, she is well positioned to capitalise on her party's growing diversity.\n\nShe has one of the most liberal voting records in the US Senate at a time when Democrats are leaning to the left, but she also has a background as a hard-nosed prosecutor.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThat background may end up a vulnerability as well, given that some progressives have criticised her for failing to support California criminal justice reform efforts and pointed to her prosecutorial record as being insufficiently sensitive to the rights of the accused. She will have to walk a fine line to tout her accomplishments while justifying her decisions.\n\nMs Harris has only been on the national stage two years, and not every political neophyte can hold up under fire the way Mr Obama did in 2008. She will be tested in the coming months, but she starts the contest near the head of the pack.\n\nWhat has Trump said? \"Nasty.\"\n\nKirsten Gillibrand\n\nWho? New York senator who likes to emphasise she's a mother of two, the candidate most closely allied to #MeToo\n\nKey issues: Women's health; campaign finance; climate change\n\nOne policy: Gillibrand's Family Bill of Rights would enact a national paid family leave programme, paid for by a payroll tax, expand child care and adoption tax credits and address the shortage of women's health providers in rural areas\n\nAnthony's take: Announcing a presidential campaign on the Stephen Colbert Show may end up a clich\u00e9 by the time the year is over, but credit Kirsten Gillibrand with being one of the first to try it.\n\nThe New York senator's decision to (almost) throw her hat into the ring isn't a huge shock.\n\nShe's long been positioning herself as one of the candidates most likely to capitalise on the #MeToo movement, and her pitch as someone who will \"fight as hard for other people's kids as she would for her own\" just might resonate.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nHer steady march to 2020 hit a few bumps along the way, though. She angered some Democrats by quickly calling for Senator Al Franken's resignation after he faced sexual harassment charges. And she alienated Clinton loyalists by criticising Bill Clinton's handling of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.\n\nThese decisions could hurt her, even if she cites them as evidence that she matches her feminist rhetoric with action.\n\nAs a New Yorker, however, she can tap into a deep vein of campaign cash. She's young and charismatic. If she catches the wave of women voters that powered Democrats to victory last year, it just might carry her to the nomination.\n\nWhat has Trump said? \"Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office \"begging\" for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump.\"\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nWho? Became a city mayor when still in his 20s and served in the Navy, first openly gay candidate\n\nKey issues: Political reform; LGBTQ rights; college loan relief\n\nOne policy: Buttigieg has proposed reshaping the Supreme Court to have five Democratic appointees, five Republican, and five selected by an agreement of the 10 appointed justices\n\nAnthony's take: Most stories published about Pete Buttigieg prominently mention that he is a Millennial - a member of the generation born between 1981 and 1996. That isn't by accident.\n\nThe South Bend, Indiana, mayor isn't the only Millennial in the 2020 race - Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is also 37 - but Mr Buttigieg is positioning himself as a voice for the young. As he notes, his generation came of age in the aftermath of 9/11, were the ones who fought in subsequent US wars and struggled to establish a financial foothold amidst the wreckage of the 2008 economic collapse.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhere their aging parents, the postwar Baby Boomers, may not be as concerned about long-term impact of US policies, Mr Buttigieg says Millennials will have to deal with the fallout from today's crises for decades.\n\nMr Buttigieg enters the race with a unique resume. He's an openly gay veteran of the Afghanistan War and a Rhode Scholar. As mid-western mayor, he's shown he has voter appeal in a region that helped deliver the presidency to Donald Trump.\n\nThe march of time ensures Millennials will run things someday. A Buttigieg presidency is a long shot for 2020, but his candidacy is a sign of things to come.\n\nWhat has Trump said? \"Alfred E Neuman [Mad magazine cartoon] cannot become president of the United States.\"\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nWho? Lawyer and current Minnesota senator\n\nKey issues: Infrastructure investments; mental health programmes; lowering prescription drug prices\n\nOne policy: A $100bn plan to tackle substance abuse and mental health - paid for in part by opioid manufacturers - by expanding state and local funding for mental health programmes\n\nAnthony's take: Amy Klobuchar may not be a household name, but the senator cruised to 2018 re-election in Midwestern-ish Minnesota. Another former prosecutor, she came off as coolly competent in the heated Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhat has Trump said? \"Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!\"\n\nJay Inslee\n\nWho? Governor of Washington state\n\nKey issues: Climate change; gun control; healthcare\n\nOne policy: A 10-year climate plan that would create eight million new energy jobs, with a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and net-zero by 2045\n\nAnthony's take: Jay Inslee is someone who in the past would be a naturally formidable presidential candidate. He's a veteran politician with the kind of executive experience that comes from being a governor of a mid-sized state.\n\nAt a small session at the liberal Netroots Nation conference last August, the 68-year-old Inslee displayed a low-key confidence and command of the issues, with the kind of self-deprecating wit that can be effective disarming critics. He won't light up a stage like Senator Cory Booker or potential candidate Beto O'Rourke, but he's a comfortable public speaker.\n\nThis isn't your father's Democratic Party, of course, and with a diverse range of candidates already in the race, Mr Inslee will be pressed to find breathing room for his campaign.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nHis answer is to fashion himself as the environmental candidate.\n\nWith the Green New Deal getting traction among progressives, Mr Inslee is touting his work addressing climate change in Washington state. He's launching his presidential bid at a solar panel factory whose success he attributes to his policies as governor.\n\nIf Mr Inslee gets the attention of Democratic voters with his environmental pitch, he can then pivot to talking about his efforts to fight the Trump administration's immigration policies, expand healthcare in his state, raise the minimum wage, enact paid family medical leave, end capital punishment and pardon Washington residents previously convicted of now-legalised marijuana drug offences.\n\nIt's a record of progressive accomplishment that the half-dozen senators already in the race, having toiled in the minority since 2014, can't match.\n\nTulsi Gabbard\n\nWho? Born in American Samoa, aged 37, represents Hawaiian district in Congress\n\nKey issues: Ending interventionist foreign policy; climate change; gun control\n\nOne policy: Gabbard's OFF Fuels for a Better Future Act would end subsidies and tax cuts for fossil fuels, ban fracking, require electric companies to use 80% renewable resources by 2027, as well as order zero car emissions by 2050\n\nAnthony's take: Tulsi Gabbard, the first Hindu member of the US Congress, is a difficult candidate to characterise.\n\nMost of the Hawaii congresswoman's views fit firmly in the Democratic Party's progressive camp. She was an early and outspoken supporter of Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign and has been an advocate of universal government-provided healthcare, raising the minimum wage and an anti-interventionist foreign policy.\n\nImage copyright Google\n\nThe Iraq War veteran has drawn criticism, however, for meeting with Bashar al-Assad in January 2017 - after the Syrian president had been accused of repeatedly using poison gas on civilian populations. The daughter of a socially conservative politician and activist, Ms Gabbard may also draw the ire of Democratic voters for her past criticism of \"homosexual extremists\" and opposition to abortion rights and gay marriage.\n\nShe's also opposed the Iran nuclear deal and condemned \"Islamic extremism\" in language more reminiscent of a Republican candidate.\n\nIf Democrats are looking for a young, charismatic iconoclast - even if it means supporting someone whose views don't always match their own - then Ms Gabbard might have a shot. As Republicans will attest, stranger things have happened.\n\nMichael Bennet\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWho? Colorado senator, the former head of Denver's public school system\n\nKey issues: Economic reform; agriculture; criminal justice reform\n\nOne policy: Bennet is a co-sponsor of the American Family Act of 2019, which seeks to expand the child tax credit based on income level and pay it monthly rather than through tax refunds\n\nAnthony's take: Bennet styles himself as a moderate who has shown he can win elections in a battleground state - a pragmatist who can advance progressive priorities like healthcare, education and equitable economic growth through bipartisan consensus.\n\nAs the surge in support for South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has shown, it's not impossible for a little-known politician to break out onto the 2020 national stage. That may give Bennet some hope. He had his own viral moment when he sharply disparaged perennial Democratic villain Ted Cruz from the Senate floor earlier this year. Bennet will have his work cut out for him, however, just to stand out in a rapidly settling field and be one of the 20 Democrats who make the first Democratic primary debate stage in late June.\n\nBill de Blasio\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWho? New York City's mayor\n\nKey issues: Police reform; education reform; immigration\n\nOne policy: De Blasio pushed to make New York a sanctuary city for immigrants and backed the creation of an ID card that would serve as proof of residency and allow immigrants to access municipal facilities\n\nAnthony's take: Bill de Blasio's pitch to Democratic primary voters is simple. He's the guy who has been enacting the progressive policies other candidates only talk about - and in the biggest city in the US.\n\nThe challenge for the mayor is that not all of those policies have worked. Others haven't progressed off the drawing board. The city's skyrocketing income inequality, public-transportation woes and affordable-housing shortage are still pressing problems despite his six years in office.\n\nThen there's the fact that being mayor of New York is a coveted job, but it creates passionate and vocal enemies. Those critics were prominently displayed on the pages of the New York Post and in the background of recent de Blasio public appearances.\n\nThe mayor must hope that, outside of the crucible of the Big Apple, voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and elsewhere will take a fresh look at his record and qualities as a candidate. He's a fighter who won't be afraid to mix it up with Donald Trump or his Democratic opponents. He is underrated on the stump. And he appears to thrive as an underdog.\n\nThat's a good thing for the mayor, since the odds are heavily stacked against him.\n\nWhat has Trump said? \"The Dems are getting another beauty to join their group. Bill de Blasio of NYC, considered the worst mayor in the US, will supposedly be making an announcement for president today. He is a JOKE, but if you like high taxes & crime, he's your man. NYC HATES HIM!\"\n\nJohn Hickenlooper\n\nWho? Former governor of Colorado\n\nKey issues: Workforce training; gun control; legalising marijuana\n\nOne policy: Enacting gun control laws like universal background checks, a ban on high-capacity magazines and raising the minimum age to buy firearms\n\nAnthony's take: John Hickenlooper's presidential pitch to Democrats is simple. He's a practical businessman-turned-politician who has shown he can successfully enact progressive policies in a moderate state.\n\nHe points to his recently concluded two terms as governor of Colorado, where he presided over new environmental regulations (although he maintained his ties to the energy industry), the expansion of health care coverage (although he opposed a universal coverage proposal) and new gun-control laws (although his support was initially tepid).\n\nIn a field where many candidates are offering shoot-for-the-moon agendas, Mr Hickenlooper embraces politics as the art of the possible, noting that his success in Colorado came through good-faith negotiations and bipartisan compromise.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIt's not an unheard-of strategy. George W Bush rode a-uniter-not-a-divider rhetoric to the White House in 2000. Barack Obama first captured the national spotlight in 2004, when he denounced a red state/blue state us-against-them outlook.\n\nThat may be a tougher sell this time around, however. Mr Hickenlooper will start toward the back of the pack, where only the loudest voices break through.\n\nHe's the second governor to enter the race, but Jay Inslee - who announced last week - is counting on his laser-like focus on climate change to distinguish his candidacy. Mr Hickenlooper is taking a broader approach, pitching himself to the majority of Democrats who say their top priority is someone who can beat Donald Trump.\n\nThe low-key, affable former brewpub-owner might be able to do that - but he's got an uphill climb if he wants to get the chance.\n\nSteve Bullock\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWho? The twice-elected governor of Montana, a typically Republican state\n\nKey issues: Net neutrality; campaign finance reform; climate change\n\nOne policy: Ending \"dark money\" political contributions, ordering government contractors to disclose donations\n\nAnthony's take:Steve Bullock took his time getting in the race - a risky move for a little-know governor from a small state that's distant from the major US population centres. He's got a folksy, rural charm that could appeal to Democratic voters looking for a candidate with middle-American appeal, but he will have a lot of catching up to do just to qualify for the upcoming Democratic debates.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro\n\nWho? Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, from 2009 to 2014, aged 44 and served as housing secretary for President Obama\n\nKey issues: Policing reform; renegotiating trade deals; housing\n\nOne policy: Castro's police reform plan would limit deadly force use, end stop-and-frisk policies, and demilitarise police by prohibiting federal funding for purchasing high-calibre rifles, armoured vehicles or other military weapons\n\nAnthony's take: It wasn't long ago that Julian Castro would have been considered a top-tier candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. He was a well-regarded mayor of San Antonio, landed the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention and went on to a Cabinet position in the Obama administration.\n\nNow, however, he may not even end up the most popular Texan in the race, if former congressman (and Democratic heartthrob) Beto O'Rourke decides to run. And there are other politicians - ones currently holding elective office or, like former Vice-President Joe Biden, with instant name recognition - who are generating more presidential buzz.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nEven if Mr Castro isn't quite the rising star he used to be - and, quite honestly, he has never been a particularly compelling public speaker - he still has the potential to build a following in the race to come. He's a third-generation Mexican-American at a time when Democrats are desperate to engage the growing Latino population in the US. He's young at a time when many Democrats are seeking generational change.\n\nAs a moderate in a party moving to the left, however, he's got his work cut out for him.\n\nSeth Moulton\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWho? Congressman who tried to derail Nancy Pelosi's ascent to Speaker\n\nKey issues: National security; election system reform; climate change\n\nOne policy: Moulton would make Election Day a national holiday, restore voting rights to felons, automatically register voters and abolish the Electoral College system\n\nAnthony's take: Moulton has been tabbed as a charismatic Democratic up-and-comer with a compelling resume for several years. By becoming the face of the anti-Pelosi Democrats, however, he's made more than a few powerful enemies. His decision to focus his efforts on making friends in Iowa and New Hampshire, instead of mending fences in Congress, is a risky one. He has political talent, but he's competing in a field where he's not the only young candidate or military veteran, he's low on name recognition and his fundraising abilities are limited compared to many of his opponents.\n\nEric Swalwell\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWho? Congressman who's a familiar face on TV\n\nKey issues: Gun control; healthcare; freedom of the press\n\nOne policy: Swalwell's No Guns for Abusers Act would bar those convicted of domestic violence from owning firearms; he has also called for a ban on assault weapons and a federal buy back programme for guns\n\nAnthony's take: He's the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee and was previously on the Homeland Security Committee, so has travelled to countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan. At 38, he's one of the younger candidates to enter the 2020 Democratic presidential race.\n\nHe's not positioning himself as the voice of his generation, however, and is instead making gun-control a central theme of his campaign. That's an issue that resonates with Democrats and yet has been on the periphery for most of his presidential rivals.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Democrat Congressman Eric Swalwell: \"It's a momentous day\"\n\nSwalwell has also been an outspoken critic of the president's and a fixture on cable news shows. Donald Trump's rise is evidence of the fact that a robust television presence can translate into voter support.\n\nThe California congressman has two children and brought his baby along to Congress for the swearing-in ceremony in January.\n\nTim Ryan\n\nWho? Ohio congressman who touts blue-collar roots\n\nKey issues: The economy; agriculture; renewable energy\n\nOne policy: Ryan wants to transform the US into a \"green economy\" and his WORKER Act would sponsor training and education programmes to bolster investment in American jobs\n\nAnthony's take: He unsuccessfully challenged Nancy Pelosi for the top Democratic leadership spot in the House of Representatives in 2016, urging his colleagues to embrace a new generation that better reflects the party's priorities.\n\nNow he has his eyes on a different prize, counting on Democrats to appreciate his appeal to the disaffected voters in the Midwest who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 but not for Hillary Clinton in 2016. He touts trade and jobs as his big issues, but he's moved to the left on social issues, as well.\n\nPrimary voters in 2020 will have to make a decision about whether to try to win the last war by recapturing Midwest blue-collar voters or fight a new one by assembling a different kind of electoral majority. If they choose the former, Ryan may have an outside chance at taking the prize.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWayne Messam\n\nWho? The mayor of Miramar in Florida\n\nKey issues: Student loan debt; gun control; immigration\n\nOne policy: Messam has proposed erasing all student debt by repealing the 2017 Republican tax cut bill to pay for it\n\nAnthony's take: He will tout his personal story, as the child of Jamaican immigrants, more than his relatively thin political record in hopes that it catches the eye of Democratic voters.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIf there is a path to the nomination for Mr Messam, it runs through South Carolina, which holds its primary shortly after Iowa and New Hampshire. If the mayor can form a bond with the Democratic voters there, a majority of whom are black, he might be able to carve out a bit of the spotlight and use it to boost his prospects in contests throughout the south.\n\nJohn Delaney\n\nWho? Son of an electrician, spent six years as congressman in Maryland.\n\nKey issues: Jobs; education; gerrymandering\n\nOne policy: A $2tn infrastructure plan that would rebuild roads, bridges, water systems and invest in \"communities left behind\", creating jobs and all paid for by raising the corporate tax rate to 27% as well as increasing the federal gas tax to account for inflation\n\nAnthony's take: Delaney was officially the first entrant into the 2020 Democratic presidential field when he announced his candidacy in July 2017. The former tech entrepreneur has a platform that focuses on jobs, education and infrastructure and a return to bipartisan co-operation.\n\nImage copyright John Delaney\n\nMarianne Williamson\n\nWho? Spiritual counsellor and writer, with millions of Twitter followers\n\nKey issues: Economic reform; reparations; immigration\n\nOne policy: Williamson's slavery reparations plan would see $100bn paid to African-Americans in a 10 year time frame\n\nAnthony's take: Ms Williamson is a best-selling author, charity organiser and spiritual adviser who counts Oprah Winfrey as her most famous follower. If the billionaire former talk-show host doesn't run, Ms Williamson may be hoping some of Oprah's star appeal translates into support for her political quest to \"dig deeper into the questions we face as a nation\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAndrew Yang\n\nWho? An entrepreneur, 44, born in New York to Taiwanese parents\n\nKey issues: Universal basic income; social media; trickle-up economic reform\n\nOne policy: Yang has proposed creating a new federal agency to oversee social media and tackle what he described as \"a huge surge in depression, anxiety and emotional issues\"\n\nAnthony's take: A technology entrepreneur who is proposing the US government pay a $1,000-a-month \"freedom dividend\" to all Americans between the ages of 18 and 64 as a form of universal basic income to cushion against fewer jobs due to increased automation.", "description": "What's Donald Trump got to say about the slew of Democrats hoping to prevent his re-election?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E9B9/production/_107533895_issues3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-25"}
