Somewhere in the modern city of Acre lies their command centre, and possibly their treasure.\n\n\"It\u2019s the stuff of childhood dreams. I\u2019m here to find them.\"\n\nThe Knights Templar fought in the crusades that began in the 11th century. They were devout Christians who fought bloody battles in the Holy Land and protected Europeans who travelled to the conquered lands.\n\n(Image: National Geographic)\n\n(Image: National Geographic)\n\nThey became rich from treasure during the Crusades and this loot became legend after the group died out in the 14th century.\n\nAcre in Israel is a setting rich in history and has now been found to hold the tunnels which Dr Lin's team say were used to move tonnes of gold from the port to a fortress - their 'treasure tower'.\n\nAnd Dr Lin believes his team has unearthed the site for the very first time.\n\nDr Lin said: \"The Templar's hidden tunnels snaked beneath the streets.\n\n(Image: National Geographic)\n\n(Image: National Geographic)\n\n\"They secretly transported gold to the Acre fortress' crowning glory, its treasure tower.\n\n\"The full magnificence of Acre's fortress was preserved for those arriving by sea.\n\n\"Its mighty sea defences and lookout towers stood against any invader.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe discovery was unveiled to the world in a new National Geographic Documentary, aired on Sunday, called 'Lost Cities with Albert Lin'.\n\nDr Lin's team used LiDAR laser technology, which allows archaeologists to scan deep into the ground without causing any damage.\n\nThey scanned the location in the ancient port city of Acre - now a modern city - where the Knights Templar had key headquarters in the Third Crusade. The scans also found a guard house.\n\n(Image: National Geographic)\n\nAnd using the latest 3D modelling technology, they have managed to bring the fortress back to life with images showing how it would have looked.\n\nThe tower is buried beneath the rocky ground and there's no firm plans to excavate the site.", "description": "A team of archaeologists in Acre in Israel have revealed the discovery of hidden tunnels used to carry gold and treasure to the Knights Templar fortress during the Crusades", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "National Geographic", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20708664.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_THP_CHP_231019SLUG_6938JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
