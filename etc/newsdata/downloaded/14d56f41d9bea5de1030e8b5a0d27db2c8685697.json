Reuters\n\nPresident Donald Trump is one of the most controversial world leaders in modern times, igniting the ire of America's staunchest allies.\n\nWhether it's the proposed Muslim ban, the US border wall and immigration, or his praise of authoritarian leaders, Trump is deft at inciting deep divisions among the public.\n\nIn 2018, political scientist Daniel Drezner summarized this consensus in The Washington Post: \" The world hates President Trump.\"\n\nThe Conversation\n\nData from the Pew Research Center illustrates Drezner's thinking.
