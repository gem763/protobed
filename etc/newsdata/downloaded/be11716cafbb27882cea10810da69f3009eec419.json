Two announcements within a few hours encapsulated both the style of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency (personalised, ignorant and erratic) and its perils. The first, a White House statement, followed a phone call with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and blindsided everyone, including parts of Mr Trump\u2019s administration. It not only announced the abrupt decision to withdraw troops from the north-eastern area bordering Turkey, abandoning the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces with which the US has partnered, but gave the green light to a Turkish invasion. The second \u2013 a tweet, following a furious backlash even from his own party at the prospect of further chaos in a desperately unstable region \u2013 announced that should Ankara do anything that \u201cI, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey\u201d.\n\nBut Ankara sees the SDF as indistinguishable from Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey and has long sought to eradicate them. Now it is poised to launch an offensive \u2013 likely to boost Mr Erdo\u011fan\u2019s flagging domestic popularity. It then wants to move many of its 3.6 million Syrian refugees \u2013 a source of growing complaints at home \u2013 to the area, reengineering its demography. Turkey never forgave its ally for partnering with the SDF; but Mr Erdo\u011fan may now find that thanks to Mr Trump he has taken on more than he can manage.\n\nDespite their critical role in tackling Islamic State, the Kurds, with whom the US has a transactional relationship, cannot be surprised to be dropped yet again \u2013 especially by a man who sees his re-election prospects as resting in part on bringing US soldiers home. It is only 10 months since James Mattis resigned as defence secretary after the president said he was withdrawing US troops. In the event, the Pentagon halved troop numbers and did its best to keep the mission out of Mr Trump\u2019s eyeline.\n\nOfficials have briefed only that 50-100 troops are being redeployed from the border area to elsewhere in Syria; around 1000 are stationed in the country. Even Mitch McConnell, the Republican senate majority leader, warned that withdrawal \u201cwould only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime\u201d \u2013 with which the Kurds will now need to cut a deal. He also warned that it would increase the risk of Isis regrouping; there are already signs of a resurgence. If the SDF ability to hold 90,000 prisoners with links to Isis is fragile, the idea of handing them over to Turkish forces, as Mr Trump mooted, is far-fetched \u2013 unless the US is inviting Turkey not only into the safe zone on the border, but all Kurdish-controlled territory. The risk that they could simply go free is real.\n\nIf Mr Trump\u2019s overall direction of travel was predictable, its abruptness and the lack of a roadmap are nonetheless shocking. It is possible that the worst-case scenario \u2013 a new humanitarian catastrophe and the revitalisation of Isis \u2013 may be averted, depending on where the US administration\u2019s thinking lands, and how the other parties respond. But the risks posed by Mr Trump\u2019s foreign dealings are only increasing as 2020 approaches and as the impeachment process gathers pace. One does not need to romanticise past US foreign policy to recognise the dangers when there is no strategy at all, but a series of inconsistent, unpredictable pronouncements and actions. The flip-flops may make it appear as if the damage wrought by Mr Trump is containable. But they are part of the problem. The issue is fundamental, and devastating.", "description": "Editorial: The ditching of Kurdish-led forces threatens to destabilise the region further.
