It could literally overnight just go back to normal again and it could be a short trend, or it could be a continued increase,\u201d he said.\n\nGreek islands opposite Turkey now host more than 26,000 asylum seekers in camps built to handle just a fraction of these numbers.\n\nIn addition to poor hygiene and frequent outbreaks of violence, many of the residents sleep in tents and complain of having to queue for hours to obtain food, take a shower or use a toilet.\n\n\u201cKeeping people on the islands in these inadequate and insecure conditions is inhumane and must come to an end,\u201d the UNHCR said Tuesday.\n\nOn Sunday, a fire killed a woman in the Lesbos camp of Moria, sparking brief rioting between asylum-seekers and police.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Greek authorities to fast-track plans to transfer over 5,000 asylum seekers already authorised to continue their asylum procedure on the mainland,\u201d the UNHCR said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn parallel, new accommodation places must be provided to prevent pressure from the islands spilling over into mainland Greece, where most sites are operating at capacity.\u201d\n\nEU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos is set to visit Greece and Turkey this week with the foreign ministers of Germany and France to discuss the situation.\n\nGreece\u2019s minister for migration also travels to Ankara on Wednesday for talks with the Turkish interior minister.\n\nMany in Greece say Turkey is not doing enough to keep its end of the bargain in thwarting attempts to cross the Aegean Sea, which result in hundreds of deaths annually.\n\nBut according to Foley, it appears that fear of arrest in Turkey spurs many migrants \u2014 Afghans in particular \u2014 to head to Greece as fast as possible.\n\n\u201cA lot of people coming from Afghanistan (spend just) a couple of weeks in Turkey and then make the crossing. A lot of people are becoming afraid of deportation from Turkey,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nFoley notes that migrants and refugees are \u201csomewhat\u201d aware of the grim conditions that await them in Greek camps even before attempting the perilous crossing.\n\n\u2013 Tougher stance \u2013\n\n\u201c(But they) believe things can\u2019t get worse than the situation that they\u2019re already in.\u201d\n\nThe new conservative Greek government, elected in July, has vowed to take a tougher stance on migration.\n\nIt plans to return to Turkey 10,000 migrants who fail asylum requirements by the end of 2020.\n\nThere are also promises to relocate hundreds of refugees to camps on the Greek mainland.\n\nBut in four and a half years under the previous left-wing Greek government, Turkey took back fewer than 2,000 people.\n\nAnd at the current rate of arrivals, any de-escalation in camp numbers will be rapidly neutralised by new arrivals.\n\nTwo more boats arrived on Wednesday morning, raising the combined total to around 300, Foley said.", "description": "The hulking Greek coastguard officer gazed intently as another group of migrants boarded a minibus on the island of Lesbos.", "authors": ["Breitbart Jerusalem"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/07/migrant.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
