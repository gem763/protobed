And Hunter Biden also wants everyone to know that, er, he won\u2019t ever do it again. Over the weekend, the younger Biden resigned from a board connected to the Chinese government and pledged to avoid working for foreign-owned businesses in a Joe Biden presidency:\n\nHunter Biden is stepping down from the board of a Chinese-backed private equity company and promising to forgo all foreign work if his father, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, is elected president in 2020. After months of keeping a relatively low-profile as President Donald Trump leveled a barrage of unsubstantiated accusations of corruption at him, the younger Biden is publicly vowing to avoid any conflict of interest. According to a statement released on his behalf by his lawyer George Mesires, Biden said he\u2019ll resign at the end of the month from the management company of a private equity fund that\u2019s backed by Chinese state-owned entities. He also pledged that he wouldn\u2019t work for any foreign-owned companies or serve on their boards during a potential Biden administration. He reiterated that he never discussed his business activities with his father. \u201cHunter always understood that his father would be guided, entirely and unequivocally, by established U.S. policy, regardless of its effects on Hunter\u2019s professional interests,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe never anticipated the barrage of false charges against both him and his father by the President of the United States.\u201d\n\nWhat false charges? The charges are that Hunter Biden traded on his connection to the Vice President of the United States, and that Joe Biden created conflicts of interest by allowing it. Those aren\u2019t false charges \u2014 they are both true and obvious, and should have been when Biden inserted himself into both Ukraine and China policy. As other media outlets (Politico in particular) have pointed out, Hunter and his uncle James have spent many years trading on Joe\u2019s position in Washington; The Intercept ran a helpful round-up last week.\n\nWhether or not Joe set out to specifically benefit Hunter in his December 2015 demand that Petro Poroshenko fire his general prosecutor is still unknown and probably unknowable, thanks to the byzantine nature of Ukrainian corruption. However, Burisma\u2019s part of that corruption was well known when Hunter joined its board, a curious move in itself considering Hunter\u2019s lack of experience in either energy production or Ukraine. Hunter\u2019s hiring by Burisma didn\u2019t necessarily implicate Joe in corruption, but it\u2019s pretty clear why Burisma added him to its board despite his complete lack of relevant experience. When Joe intervened in Ukraine\u2019s corruption investigations by threatening US aid, what did he expect Poroshenko to think Biden intended with a billion dollars in US aid \u2014 \u201cinvestigate my son\u201d? Come on, man.\n\nAnd so now we have the curious repositioning of Hunter\u2019s belated action in establishing an appearance of propriety years too late. Hunter\u2019s declaration that he won\u2019t take any more foreign-owned board assignments if his father is president underscores the fact that he shouldn\u2019t have taken them when his father was vice-president, either. That\u2019s especially true with companies owned or controlled by a hostile state (China) or a massively corrupt oligarch controlling a government (Ukraine).\n\nThis is no virtuous sacrifice; it\u2019s a recognition of having been caught and spinning it for appearance\u2019s sake. If Joe doesn\u2019t win the election, of course, then Hunter can take all of the board appointments his heart desires \u2014 if he gets any invitations at all, which seems very, very doubtful.", "description": "Appearances.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hunter-joe-biden.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
