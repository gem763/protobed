But not next Friday when Artur Beterbiev and Oleksandr Gvozdyk collide in another terrific contest.\n\nOutside the heavyweights, boxing is doing a great job of putting the best in with the best and light-heavy is red hot.\n\nBeterbiev, a career amateur from Russia, is an amazing fighter. With his aggressive style, he was already well suited to the pro game.\n\nBoxing out of the same Montreal gym as Jean Pascal, he made up for missing out on Olympic gold by claiming the IBF title in his 12th pro fight two years ago. Gvozdyk is more orthodox. Upright in the European style, he uses his reach well and likes to let the right hand go.\n\nBut he can be hit. He joined forces with Teddy Atlas at the back end of last year to correct the flaw.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAtlas, who learned his trade with Cus D\u2019Amato, observed that in almost all his fights, Gvozdyk, though undefeated, was caught clean at least once. There was further evidence of this in their first fight together last December against the unfortunate Adonis Stevenson.\n\nHe caught Stevenson at the start of the third and finished it in the 11th to claim the WBC title, but was troubled by the southpaw backhand left and in deep trouble in the seventh.\n\nThis will be his third fight with Atlas. As much as I respect Atlas, I\u2019m not sure the problem is fixable at the age of 32. And you don\u2019t want to give Beterbiev any freebies.\n\nThough England\u2019s Callum Johnson had him over in the second round, Beterbiev finished it in the fourth. In 14 pro contests, no opponent has heard the final bell. Gvozdyk bangs too with all but three of his 17 bouts ending early. He could have Beterbiev over, but I\u2019m not sure that will save him. Beterbiev has too much power and will likely finish it by stoppage in the championship rounds.\n\nA loss is not necessarily the end in this division as Sergey Kovalev showed in defending the WBO crown against Anthony Yarde after defeats by Andre Ward and Eleider Alvarez.\n\nKovalev defends against Saul Alvarez next. At 36 you can see the attraction for Canelo, but moving up to light heavy against \u2018The Krusher\u2019 is no bargain, even for him.", "description": "Beterbiev has 14 wins and 14 knockouts and Mirror columnist BARRY McGUIGAN has backed him to extend that record", "authors": ["Barry Mcguigan", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20562874.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Top-Rank-Boxing-Fall-Schedule-News-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
