For seven athletes, Saturday\u2019s UFC on ESPN 6 event marked that special moment in their career.\n\nCheck out this week\u2019s rookie report to see what kind of first impression those fighters made on the sport\u2019s biggest stage from TD Garden in Boston.\n\n* * * * *\n\nTanner Boser\n\nDivision: Heavyweight\n\nResult: Tanner Boser def. Daniel Spitz via unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27)\n\nRecord: (17-5-1 MMA, 1-0 UFC)\n\nGrade: B+\n\nTanner Boser is just fine with you talking about his mullet rather than his fighting skills. He also doesn\u2019t mind if you say he looks like a fitter version of the man best known as \u201cBig Country,\u201d Roy Nelson. But focusing on only those aspects of his debut would be a great disservice to \u201cThe Bulldozer.\u201d\n\nBoser was incredibly composed in his UFC debut, moving well for a big man, switching stances and peppering Daniel Spitz\u2019s legs before landing big punches up top, as well. Boser wasn\u2019t necessarily always the man moving forward, but it was clear he was sticking to a solid gameplan, utilizing his mobility to neutralize his opponent\u2019s length.\n\nIn terms of evaluating his complete game, we didn\u2019t get to see much in the realm of grappling, but Boser\u2019s ability to manage range and fire in punches and kicks from both sides was impressive, especially in a UFC debut. His performance didn\u2019t necessarily scream \u201cfuture UFC champion,\u201d but he\u2019s not going to be an easy out for anyone looking to stand and trade at heavyweight.", "description": "Fighters from around the globe dream of the day they'll step into the octagon the first time \u2013 so how did the newcomers perform on Saturday?", "authors": ["John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/brendan-allen-kevin-holland-ufc-boston-6.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
