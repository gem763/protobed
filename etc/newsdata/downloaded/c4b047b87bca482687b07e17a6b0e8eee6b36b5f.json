For your weekend reading, we've started in-case-you-missed-it compilations of some of the week's top USA TODAY Opinion pieces. As always, thanks for reading, and for your feedback.\n\n\u2014 USA TODAY Opinion editors\n\nBy Nathan H. Lents\n\n\"To be clear, (this) theory does not prove anything about the Adam and Eve story. It doesn\u2019t even offer positive evidence for it, but that is not the goal. Instead, he provides a bridge for those whose faith insists on the real existence of Adam and Eve. Until now, they have had little choice but to reject evolutionary science, at least partly but often wholly.\"\n\nBy Jennifer Horn\n\n\"Republicans have gotten it wrong on this president in every way. ... But it is on impeachment that congressional Republicans have most dramatically abandoned their oaths of office. Instead of treating the impeachment proceeding like the solemn constitutional procedure that it is, they have responded with cynical, predictable political spin, demeaning the Constitution and the American people in the process.\"\n\nThank you, Kurds. (Photo: Bruce Plante/Tulsa (Oklahoma) World/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nBy Jason Baker\n\n\"America has a long-standing relationship with the Kurdish people, despite a history of overpromising, underdelivering, and often supporting the Kurds when it was helpful and convenient and ignoring them when it was not. ... The moral failure of (Trump's) decision would be bad enough were it not for the strategic implications as well: An invasion by Turkey could roll back allied successes and provide ISIS with space to operate.\"\n\nBy Laurence Tribe\n\n\"The White House\u2019s blanket stonewalling of the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump isn\u2019t just deeply troubling or further indirect evidence of the president\u2019s underlying abuse of public power for private gain. It signals another clear ground for his impeachment: obstruction of Congress.\"\n\nBy Barronelle Stutzman\n\n\"Why would people want to force me to celebrate a wedding that violates my faith? Wouldn\u2019t they want someone able to devote themselves to it? I wouldn\u2019t want to force an atheist to sing at my church on Sunday or a gay graphic designer to create a website promoting my church\u2019s views on marriage. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\"\n\nWaters of impeachment. (Photo: Adam Zyglis/The Buffalo (New York) News/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nBy Jason Sattler\n\n\"The Republicans in Congress who are inviting Trump to continue his torching of the Constitution are the greatest threat to this republic that any of us will ever see. And impeachment will fail unless it exposes this complicit and cowardly GOP. ... (Impeachment) must make the case that our democracy is at stake. To do this, Democrats must show that the GOP made Trump\u2019s corruption inevitable. Thus, the American people must check the Republican Party with furious anger.\"\n\nBy Jenny Beth Martin\n\n\"House Democrats have made clear their move for impeachment has nothing to do with the Framers\u2019 vision of impeachment. For (them), it\u2019s not about defending the Constitution against a usurper; it\u2019s merely a political response to an election they still cannot believe they lost.\"\n\nTrump's unmatched wisdom. (Photo: Dave Granlund/PoliticalCartoons.com)\n\nBy Steven Strauss\n\n\"(Republicans) chose not to make (or even seriously debate) any substantial cuts to government programs that would balance the revenue lost by their series of massive unfunded tax cuts. Unquestioning and unsubstantiated belief in the magical power of tax cuts isn\u2019t a viable economic policy. The GOP is putting America on an unsustainable path that is disastrous both for its fiscal future and for the hopes of people trying to get ahead.\"\n\nBy Tom Nichols and Philippe Reines\n\n\"We believe the House should pursue a limited, but varied, set of articles revolving around abuse of power and obstruction of justice. Impeachment should serve as a reminder that there are many more offenses against the Constitution than outright treason or bribery.\u201d\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
