Her party\u2019s unambiguously pro-EU stance has allowed it to peel off unionist Remainers disaffected by the pro-Leave positions of the main unionist parties.\n\nPolls suggest Alliance could even pose a serious challenge to the dominant Democratic Unionist Party, were the U.K. to hold an election in the coming months.\n\n\u201cI think that because of Brexit, people who previously might not necessarily have wandered around saying \u2018I\u2019m a proud European,\u2019 suddenly feel that something valuable is being stripped away and they don\u2019t like that,\u201d Long said in an interview.\n\nAs leader of the liberal Alliance Party, Long is one of the beneficiaries of the destabilization of Northern Irish politics by the U.K.\u2019s Brexit referendum.\n\nLong, who describes Brexit as \u201cbillions spent on something we don\u2019t need to do\u201d has dedicated her time in the European Parliament to lobbying authorities on both sides of the Channel to do everything they can to prevent a no-deal Brexit \u2014 and ideally reverse the decision to leave altogether.\n\nIn the longer term, Long and her supporters could end up playing a key role in another constitutional debate: the region\u2019s long-standing disagreement over whether to remain part of the U.K. or break away to join Dublin to create a united Ireland.\n\nAlliance does not currently hold a position on the issue of reunification. Long says the party would \u201cmake a decision at the time based on the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nPolls indicate it\u2019s Long and her supporters \u2014 the undecided, largely disinterested middle \u2014 who would provide the key swing vote deciding the region\u2019s future.\n\nThe biggest factor affecting their decision: Brexit.\n\nSilent majority\n\nNorthern Ireland remains deeply segregated, with separate education systems, occasional physical walls between Irish nationalist and British unionist communities, and the constitutional question dominating every political contest.\n\nBut for more than a decade, the largest group of people in the region has been people who don\u2019t identify as unionists or nationalists: a group who are deeply alienated from politics and identify as \u201cneither,\u201d according to the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey.\n\nA study by the academics Katy Hayward and Cathal McManus found that these \u201cneithers\u201d are predominantly female, but include people of all ages, religious backgrounds and of both British and Irish national identities. The difficulty is getting them to show up at elections.\n\n\u201cMany of those people who you might assume would be the natural constituency for Alliance, people who don\u2019t define themselves narrowly as unionist or nationalist, have no interest in getting involved in politics,\u201d Long said. \u201cIt can be very difficult to get those people to come out and vote.\u201d\n\nBut Brexit may be changing that. This year has been a breakthrough for the small Alliance Party, buoyed by increased turnout and hardened commitment to EU membership among those who voted Remain.\n\nWhile Northern Ireland voted 56 percent against Brexit, it is forecast to take the greatest economic hit of any part of the U.K.\n\nPolls also indicate that the 2016 referendum result has alienated the \u201cneithers\u201d from Britain, and that the outcome of the negotiations will be crucial in how they feel about unification with Ireland.\n\nA poll by Lucid Talk found that if Brexit doesn\u2019t happen, a majority of \u201cneithers\u201d would favor remaining in the U.K.\n\nIf, instead, the U.K. were to leave the EU under the terms of the deal negotiated by former Prime Minister Theresa May, they would lean toward unification with Ireland. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, they swing hard in favor of a united Ireland.\n\nThis year has been a breakthrough for the small Alliance Party, buoyed by increased turnout and hardened commitment to EU membership among those who voted Remain.\n\nA more recent poll by Lord Ashcroft did not measure \u201cneithers\u201d but found similar results among those who did not identify as being Catholic or Protestant. Those of no religion are 67 percent in favor of Remain; 81 percent feel Brexit strengthened the case for Irish unification; and 71 percent said Brexit makes them feel \u201cless close to the U.K.\u201d\n\nThe British government\u2019s embrace of a hard Brexit position has left the Northern Ireland centerground feeling unheard and overlooked and \u2014 unexpectedly \u2014 in sync with a Dublin government that has been arguing to retain the region largely in EU alignment.\n\n\u201cI see myself as a European, that matters to me,\u201d Long said. \u201cI think it also matters hugely to the kind of people who vote Alliance.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrexit has brought it front and center,\u201d she added. \u201cSo we see people who are unionist, who are nationalist, people who are British, Irish, people [who are] both of those things or neither, actually coalesce around that European identity.\u201d\n\nCarving a space\n\nLong grew up in eastern Belfast during the conflict in a \u201cmilitant and single-identity\u201d pro-British community. She credits her years studying civil engineering at Queens University Belfast with transforming her point of view, as it put her into a mixed environment of nationalists, unionists and people from around the world.\n\nShe joined the Alliance Party after a canvasser came to her door by chance, and was drawn into active politics on a feeling of optimism and resolution to build a better future that came with the ceasefires of the 1990s.\n\nHer resume includes a series of political upsets, starting in 2010 with her defeat of Peter Robinson, then first minister of Northern Ireland and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. Long took the Belfast East seat he had held for 30 years to become the first Alliance Party MP in the House of Commons.\n\nLong was drawn into active politics on a feeling of optimism and resolution to build a better future that came with the ceasefires of the 1990s.\n\nShe lasted just one term. A 2012 Alliance Party motion to limit the number of days the Union Flag is flown over Belfast City Hall was the catalyst for the so-called Flag Protests \u2014 weeks of wildcat unrest in which the party\u2019s constituency offices were ransacked and petrol-bombed.\n\nDaily protests gathered outside Long\u2019s office for months, and she received repeated death threats from loyalist paramilitaries. In 2015 a pan-unionist electoral pact succeeded in reelecting Robinson to replace her in the Belfast East seat.\n\nShe considered quitting politics, describing it as \u201ca bruising five years.\u201d But instead, she ran for a seat in Northern Ireland\u2019s Stormont Assembly in 2016 and took the leadership of her party. She was returned in elections the following year, in which she topped the poll in Belfast East.\n\nThis year, the surge of support for the Alliance Party that followed the Brexit referendum culminated in a series of victories. In local elections in May, Alliance increased its representation on local councils by 65 percent, and extended its reach into areas far beyond its traditional base in Belfast.\n\nThis was followed within weeks by Long\u2019s election to the European Parliament, drawing ballots from across the spectrum and more than doubling the Alliance Party vote.\n\nSince the first European Parliament election 1979, the region had always sent two unionists and a nationalist to Strasbourg and Brussels. This year, Long became the first MEP ever to be elected in Northern Ireland not affiliated with either group.\n\n\u201cI work hard,\u201d she added. \u201cYou\u2019re fighting against the politics of fear that is played out at every election.\u201d\n\nDesegregation\n\nAs leader, Long has sought to de-emphasize questions of Irish and British identity, pushing progressive policies and efforts at reconciliation.\n\nThe collapse of a power-sharing agreement between nationalists and unionists has left Northern Ireland without a government since 2017, and Long cites a litany of issues that can\u2019t be rectified without an assembly: a hole in education funding that has left parents and teachers chipping in to buy basic supplies; the absence of a minister who can improve infrastructure works, preventing development.\n\nAfter a recent election, Long recalled, it was discovered that the majority of the newly elected Belfast councilors had never been outside their own quarter of the city. A bus tour of the city was organized to redress this.\n\n\u201cI was stunned,\u201d Long said. \u201cIf our political leadership is so closed into these very small communities and not seeing the big picture of the city, then that\u2019s a challenge for society.\u201d\n\nAs leader, Long has sought to de-emphasize questions of Irish and British identity, pushing progressive policies and efforts at reconciliation.\n\nShe credits simple interventions, like mixed-community schools, and the advent of the Belfast Glider bus that allows people to travel directly between east and west Belfast, as having a significant impact. They \u201callow people to see that the people on the opposite side of the city, on the opposite side of the wall, don\u2019t have horns,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd so it\u2019s ironic that it\u2019s another constitutional question that is dominating Long\u2019s recent political career.\n\nLong has been on what she described as a race against time to use her position to protect Northern Ireland from the potentially dire fallout of a no-deal Brexit. Her calendar is filled with appointments lobbying whoever she can to try to prevent a crash out, or if possible, stop Britain from leaving the EU at all. On Wednesday, she hosted a cross-party hearing on Brexit and Northern Ireland, gathering MEPs from across Ireland and the U.K.\n\nThe Brexit negotiations will also determine how much time Long has in the job. Without an extension, her pass to the European Parliament will expire on October 31.\n\n\u201cThe U.K. is working its way through a constitutional crisis,\u201d Long said. \u201cI\u2019m saying to the European partners: Give us time.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody wants a broken Britain at the edge of the EU, constantly in turmoil and in conflict,\u201d she said. \u201cTime is the one thing that the EU can give us.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
