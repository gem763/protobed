At 17? And make it the cover????\n\n\"Even if the picture was supposed to look like some robot version of me... I did not consent in any way.\"\n\nEilish is one of 2019's biggest break-out stars, topping the charts in 19 countries, including the UK and US, with her goth-pop debut album When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go.\n\n'Honouring Billie's impact'\n\nThe teenager has previously told NME: \"There's people out there saying: 'Dress like a girl for once! Wear tight clothes you'd be much prettier and your career would be so much better' No it wouldn't. It literally would not.\n\n\"That's why I wear baggy clothes,\" she said in a separate interview for Calvin Klein. \"Nobody can have an opinion because they haven't seen what's underneath.\"\n\nIn a statement, Nylon said it had only meant to celebrate the singer's achievements.\n\n\"It was never our intention to create a look that is confusing or insulting to Billie Eilish,\" it said. \"It was only ever our intention to honour Billie's impact and her work by creating this avatar which is part of a cover series highlighting the power of digital prodigy artists.\n\n\"This avatar is a piece of 3D artwork created in dedication to her achievements and the positive effect she has had on millions around the globe - including us.\"\n\nControl over image\n\nEilish is not the first star to complain about becoming a cover star without permission.\n\nIn 2017, Stormzy took the NME to task for putting him on the cover of an issue dedicated to discussing mental health.\n\nAlthough he had talked openly about his depression in the past, the magazine had not conducted a fresh interview. \"I've no issue with sharing my story but, with my permission!\" wrote Stormzy on Twitter.\n\nDespite such complaints, the actions of Nylon Germany and NME are not uncommon in the publishing industry. A celebrity doesn't have to give consent to be featured on a magazine cover, and editors frequently commission portraits to illustrate the themes of a profile.\n\nThe debate over how the press portrays celebrities has been intensifying for several years, as stars increasingly prefer to curate their own images directly on social media.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
