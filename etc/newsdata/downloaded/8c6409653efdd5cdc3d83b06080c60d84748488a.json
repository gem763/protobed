The existence of the feature was first reported earlier this month, and it allows up to four online players (\u201cor even more in ideal conditions\u201d according to Valve) to participate in a local multiplayer game as though they were sitting in the same room.\n\nTo get the feature you\u2019ll need to participate in the Steam Client Beta. After you\u2019re signed up, you\u2019ll find a \u201cRemote Play Together\u201d option in your Steam friends list in compatible local multiplayer games. Once connected, the game will act as though each player\u2019s controller is plugged directly into your computer, and Valve says it\u2019s also possible to share control of the keyboard and mouse.\n\nOnly one player actually needs to own the game\n\nInterestingly, Remote Play Together only requires the host to actually own the game that\u2019s being streamed, which could make it a cheap way for a group of friends to try out a new game, even if it already supports online multiplayer. The technology is also cross-platform, so you can stream a game running on a Windows 10 machine to friends who are using Mac or Linux. Valve also says it\u2019s \u201cinvestigating\u201d supporting the feature on iOS and Android, but that it has nothing to announce about these platforms today.\n\nThe main downside of Remote Play Together is that network latency could give the host a slight advantage in competitive games, although Valve says that should only be a \u201csmall\u201d factor when everyone has a good connection.\n\nValve says that \u201cthousands\u201d of titles should support Remote Play Together starting today, and that developers are free to opt in or out of the feature at any time. In order to start using the feature, you can sign up to the Steam Client Beta using the instructions on this page.", "description": "Steam\u2019s new Remote Play Together feature has launched in beta.
