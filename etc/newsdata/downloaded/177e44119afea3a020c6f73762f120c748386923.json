However, some Russians with no history of doping were cleared to compete as neutrals.\n\nThe IOC chose not to ban all Russian athletes from the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro after a WADA-commissioned report revealed a state-backed doping programme across many sports.\n\nNEW PEOPLE\n\nRussia has three months to respond to WADA\u2019s concerns, the head of RUSADA and the Kremlin said.\n\nWhen contacted by Reuters, RUSADA director general Yuri Ganus would not comment on the nature of the inconsistencies uncovered by WADA. He said the laboratory\u2019s database had not been under the agency\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cI am profoundly convinced that new people are needed to get out of this anti-doping crisis,\u201d Ganus said. \u201cWe need to get out of this vicious circle.\u201d\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin was aware of the issue, but that it was a matter for the country\u2019s sports authorities.\n\nRUSADA was reinstated by WADA last year after the Russian agency served a suspension of nearly three years over evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics. The handover of laboratory data to WADA had been a condition for its reinstatement.\n\nRussian Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov said the ministry would cooperate with WADA in determining what was wrong with the data.\n\n\u201cWe were told that the database submitted to WADA is slightly different that from the copy that WADA experts took in Moscow in 2019,\u201d Kolobkov said in a statement.\n\n\u201cExperts in the field of digital technology from both sides will determine what these discrepancies are and what they are linked to.\u201d", "description": "The head of Russia's Olympic Committee said on Monday that his country's participation at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics was at risk over the alleged manipulation of anti-doping laboratory data.", "authors": ["Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
