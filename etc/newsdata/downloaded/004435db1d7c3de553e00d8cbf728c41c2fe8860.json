I told him I had an extra R50 and asked if he could wait outside my house while I fetch R10 from my house, but he wouldn\u2019t let me.\n\n\u201cHe told me that customers have a habit of conning drivers while trying to escape payments. He said I should just give him the money he needed but I didn\u2019t have any. I told him that as a driver he should always have change,\u201d she said.\n\nAn increasingly concerned Mvelase said the driver became frustrated and \u201cwas swearing at me, demanding that I pay for the trip\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe grabbed me tightly by the arm and told me I was not going anywhere. He locked the doors and wouldn\u2019t let me out of the taxi and started driving off with me. Luckily, he only locked the front doors and I managed to get out of the taxi while it was moving.\u201d\n\nMvelase said the man drove off with her valuables, including her cell phone, purse with bank cards and the shoes she had been wearing.\n\n\u201cWhen he drove off, I ran, and he just drove away. I then went to the police station to report the incident, but the police said they could not help me because I didn\u2019t have the vehicle\u2019s registration number,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday, Mvelase managed to open a case at the Town Hill police station.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why he did what he did. I was left shaken after the incident and it just proves that women are not safe anywhere.\u201d\n\nMvelase said she had spoken to the company about the alleged incident but was told that she would need to open a case with the police.\n\n\u201cBolt refuse to take responsibility\u201a\u201d she said.\n\nIn a message which Mvelase said was sent to her by Bolt on Wednesday, the company acknowledged that the driver is in possession of her items.\n\n\u201cThe driver has been contacted and is not disputing the fact that he is in possession of your items. Communication will further be provided on the app as the support team has already taken steps in resolving the query,\u201d read the message.\n\nBolt spokesperson Gareth Taylor said the company was aware of the incident and was investigating.\n\nTaylor said: \u201cAccording to the rider, after completing the trip, the driver did not have sufficient change for the cash payment made. The rider left her belongings in the vehicle to collect change in her home, but the driver drove off with her possessions before she could return with payment.\u201d\n\nHowever, Bolt said the \u201crider\u201d (Mvelase) had said there was no attempted kidnapping, which Mvelase denies.\n\n\u201cIt is Bolt policy to immediately suspend from the platform any driver who is under any form of police investigation, and to remove them completely should they be convicted of any crime.\n\n\u201cBolt will engage with the SAPS wherever possible to assist in their investigation,\u201d Taylor added.", "description": "A local woman has claimed that the driver of an online taxi service allegedly \u201ctried to abduct\u201d her after an altercation over money this week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8666/60d01a27775b41c8a066fd19cc7d0e4f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
