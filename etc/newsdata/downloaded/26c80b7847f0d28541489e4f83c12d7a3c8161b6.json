Really sorry about this, Winnie, but China\u2019s an important market!\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh has been banned in China online and at movie theaters because snarky commentators have suggested that he resembles the portly President Xi Jinping. But these days Xi doesn\u2019t want to censor information just in his own country; he also wants to censor our own discussions in the West.\n\nThat\u2019s the backdrop to China\u2019s hysterical reaction to a tweet by Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets\u2019 general manager, sympathizing with Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy demonstrations.\n\nWhen the N.B.A. moved into China in the early 2000s, it made a plausible argument that engagement would help extend our values to China. Instead, the Communist Party is exploiting N.B.A. greed to extend its values to the United States.\n\n\u00a9 Getty China's President Xi Jinping. China is also forcing American Airlines to treat Taiwan as part of China, and it bullied Mercedes-Benz into apologizing for quoting the Dalai Lama. It made Marriott fire an employee for \u201cwrongfully liking\u201d a tweet by an organization that favors Tibetan independence.\n\nThere\u2019s not much we can do about a dictator like Xi bullying his own citizens, but we should not let him stifle debate in our country.\n\nLet me interrupt this diatribe, however, for important context. Those of us who criticize Xi must also have the humility to acknowledge that child mortality is now lower in Beijing than in Washington, D.C., that China has established new universities at a rate of one a week and that Shanghai\u2019s public schools put our own school systems to shame.\n\nSo, yes, let\u2019s stand up to Chinese bullying \u2014 and speak up when China detains at least one million Muslims, in what may be the biggest internment of people based on religion since the Holocaust. But let\u2019s also note that China has helped lift more people out of poverty more quickly than any nation in history. With China, it\u2019s always helpful to hold at least two contradictory ideas in our heads at the same time.\n\nXi\u2019s anxiety about the internet, religion, Hong Kong protesters, even Winnie-the-Pooh underscores his own insecurities. Xi seems terrified that real information will infiltrate the Chinese echo chamber, undermining his propaganda department\u2019s personality cult around a benign \u201cUncle Xi.\u201d\n\nWe can exploit Xi\u2019s fear to gain leverage \u2014 and maybe to chip away at Chinese nationalism just a little bit \u2014 with three steps.\n\nFirst, raise China\u2019s blocking of outside news sites and social media platforms as a trade issue before the World Trade Organization. In a new book, \u201cSchism,\u201d about China and global trade, Paul Blustein explains how the U.S. could join with other countries to make such a trade case based on the W.T.O. agreement. Trade experts aren\u2019t sure the case would succeed, but it\u2019s worth trying.\n\n\u00a9 Vincent Yu/Associated Press Protesters in Hong Kong last year used a Winnie-the-Pooh doll to taunt President Xi Jinping.\n\nA second step the United States should take is to invest more in internet circumvention technologies to help ordinary Chinese vault the Great Chinese Firewall and read uncensored news. The U.S. spends more than $700 million a year on broadcast programs to sometimes-obscure parts of the world, but only tiny sums to help citizens of closed countries access the free internet.\n\nRichard Stengel, a former under secretary of state who was involved in these programs, told me that he generally agreed that the U.S. should invest more in circumvention technologies. \u201cIt aligns with American values,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be in favor.\u201d\n\nSome American officials I\u2019ve spoken with worry that this would enrage Xi. Yes, it might. Frankly, it\u2019s also not clear that many Chinese want to access the outside internet, for they don\u2019t much use tools like Ultrasurf and Psiphon that already enable them to do so (with a bit of difficulty).\n\nThose are fair concerns, but I worry even more about the rise of nationalism in China inculcated in part by the Communist Party\u2019s education system and propaganda machine. I\u2019ve seen over the decades how a freer flow of information eventually can liberate minds and peoples, and the world would be better off if that process unfolded in China. \u00a9 AP Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nThen there\u2019s a third step, still more delicate and dangerous: The American intelligence community should gather information on the corruption in the Xi family that has allowed it to amass a huge fortune \u2014 with a hint that if China undertakes a brutal crackdown of Hong Kong or an assault on Taiwan, this information will slip out. This is what Xi fears most, and we shouldn\u2019t pass up that leverage.\n\nI love China and believe in engaging it. We should try to work out a trade deal and cooperate on issues from climate change to drug trafficking. But let\u2019s push back when Xi tries to stifle free discussion not only in China but also in America.\n\nOtherwise, if American business continues to kowtow, some day there may be a knock on the door, and there\u2019ll be \u201cUncle Xi\u201d sternly asking us to hand over Pooh Bear.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
