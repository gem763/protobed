These unreliable public surveys range from a recent Gallup survey to a recent Fox News poll and others that somehow suggest impeachment support is on the rise since Democrats moved forward with it a month ago, when in fact it is not.\n\n\u201cOver the past month, many news outlets have published polls regarding the impeachment inquiry with highly inconsistent and inaccurate methodologies that lead to inaccurate top line results,\u201d the memo opens. \u201cThis memo seeks to breakdown the methodology in recently released polls and provide insight in what to watch out for in these releases, especially when compared to the RNC\u2019s proven internal polling. We took a look at three common issues with recent public polling.\u201d\n\nUnder the memo\u2019s first subheading, \u201cFlawed Sampling Methodology,\u201d the RNC memo explains that both the Gallup and the Fox News polls were incorrect because they used methods that do not produce accurate results.\n\nThe Gallup survey, for instance, polled just \u201cadults\u201d\u2014not registered or likely voters\u2014meaning that people who are ineligible to vote like illegal aliens could be included in the survey.\n\n\u201cMany of the recently released public polls don\u2019t poll registered, or ideally, likely voters, they poll all adults, often not even verifying that they\u2019re eligible voters,\u201d the RNC memo continues. \u201cFor instance, the recent Gallup poll released last week, that fielded from October 1st through 13th, they admittedly surveyed 1,526 adults 18+ living in the US \u2013 this does not mean that these people are even eligible voters, much less registered or likely voters.\u201d\n\nThe RNC memo says the Fox News poll, which has come under fire from all sides, including its fellow News Corporation publication, the New York Post, used a flawed sample-gathering method called \u201crandom digit dialing,\u201d which is \u201coutdated\u201d and unreliable at best.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the recent Fox News poll that fielded October 6th through 8th, while they intended to survey Registered Voters, they used a wildly outdated methodology to do so \u2013 Random Digit Dialing,\u201d the RNC memo continues. \u201cWith this methodology, there is no way to ensure that the voters contacted are actually registered voters \u2013 much like with self-reported vote intention, voters lie when asked about self-reported voter registration, and many more do not know if they are registered to vote in a given jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nUnder the next subheading, \u201cBad Partisan Split,\u201d the RNC memo rips the Fox News poll again for its inaccuracies as well as the recent Pew survey.\n\n\u201cMany of the recent polls released used a wildly inaccurate partisan split,\u201d the RNC memo states, adding:\n\nFor the more egregious example, look no farther than the aforementioned Fox News Poll that fielded October 6th through 8th. The self-identified party breakdown of the poll is 48% Democrat, 40% Republican, and 12% Independent. In this poll, the high number of Democrats and low percentage of Independents drives support for impeachment.\n\nAs for the Pew poll, it is even worse than the Fox News poll.\n\n\u201cLooking at another recent poll that Pew released \u2013 fielding from October 1st through 13th \u2013 we see a similar issue with the partisan split,\u201d the RNC memo says. \u201cThis survey counted 1,942 of their respondents as Democrat or Lean Democrat out of 3,487 (56%), which is a significantly higher percentage of self-identifying Democrats than is representative of the national electorate.\u201d\n\nThe next subheading, \u201cHistorically Inaccurate,\u201d jabs again at Fox, Pew, and Gallup\u2014while also ripping SurveyUSA.\n\n\u201cIf the flawed methodology this cycle weren\u2019t enough, many of these pollsters do not have a strong track record,\u201d the RNC memo continues. \u201cFor example, Fox News, in 2016 projected that Hillary Clinton would win the popular vote by +4%. Additionally, Pew, who also released a recent poll, projected Clinton would win the popular vote by +6 points, which was -4 points off the actual result. Another one, Survey USA, who just recently released a wildly flawed poll, projected that Clinton would win the popular vote by +10 points \u2013 a result -8 points off from the actual result. An even worse offender, Gallup, starting at the beginning of October in 2016, just flat out refused to poll the head-to-head matchup in the Presidential race.\u201d", "description": "An RNC memo contains polling data showing the public, even Democrat voters, are turning against the Democrat Party\u2019s \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d", "authors": ["Matthew Boyle"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/07/AP_17037562475086.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
