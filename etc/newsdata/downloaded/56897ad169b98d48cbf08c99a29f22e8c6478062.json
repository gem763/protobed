Biden fending off accusations of nepotism and corruption involving his son Hunter, Sen. Bernard Sanders striving to demonstrate vitality after suffering a heart attack, billionaire Tom Steyer seizing a spot for the first time in the debate limelight and Sen. Elizabeth Warren surging to the front in leadoff states by running against the uber wealthy.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the political drama on stage will be overshadowed by House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry targeting President Trump.\n\nThe burning question when Democrats took the stage for the September debate in Houston was whether anyone would knock Mr. Biden from his frontrunner perch.\n\n\u201cWe are in a different world than we were when the last debate occurred,\u201d said Christopher P. Borick, political science professor and director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion.\n\nHe expects the impeachment inquiry and the U.S. pullout in Syria to drive part of the discussion Tuesday on the debate stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, just outside Columbus.\n\nMr. Biden also must be prepared to answer more questions about his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China while he was vice president.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t just ignore it. He has to respond and how he responds and to what degree [he responds] are going to be central to his prospects moving forward,\u201d Mr. Borick said.\n\nIn the run-up to the debate, Mr. Biden attempted a preemptive strike at the Hunter Biden issue, including outlining an ambitious anti-corruption plan he said he would implement if elected.\n\nHunter Biden announced over the weekend that he would step down from the board of a Chinese-backed firm. He also agreed to an interview Tuesday with ABC News to address questions about his overseas business deals while his father was vice president.\n\nHunter Biden sealed the more than $1 billion deal with a Chinese-backed firm after flying to China with his father aboard Air Force Two.\n\nAnother foreign deal \u2014 Hunter Biden\u2019s $600,000-a-year job on the board of a Ukraine gas company \u2014 is at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, which now has the overwhelming support of Democratic primary voters \u2014 including a majority of the party\u2019s voters in the early primary states that say Mr. Trump should be locked up.\n\nMr. Trump in July requested the Ukraine president investigate the Bidens, a request that prompted a whistleblower complaint that Mr. Trump was abusing his Oval Office power to dig up dirt on a political foe. The whistleblower, who is believed to be a CIA official who was assigned to the White House, spurred the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nMr. Trump said he made a legitimate request for a corruption probe.\n\nMr. Biden has insisted that he too did nothing wrong and says the episode demonstrates that Mr. Trump is afraid of him.\n\n\u201cIf I am your next president I\u2019m going to build on the squeaky clean, transparent environment that we had in the Obama-Biden White House,\u201d Mr. Biden said in Iowa. \u201cNo one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they\u2019re a Cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or foreign country.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s rivals for the nomination have avoided criticizing him directly for his son\u2019s apparent sweetheart deals, in part to avoid the appearance of siding with Mr. Trump.\n\nHowever, several have said they wouldn\u2019t let their VP\u2019s son engage in questionable foreign ventures.\n\n\u201cWhether fair or not, the allegations against Biden have put him on the defensive and assisted the surging Elizabeth Warren,\u201d said Mark J. Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University.\n\nIndeed, Ms. Warren has been on the rise, but also has faced scrutiny over her claim that she was pushed out of a teaching job in the 1970\u2019s because she was visibly pregnant.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Sanders\u2019 recent health scare has reintroduced a question potentially damaging to the 78-year-old\u2019s candidacy: How old is too old to be president?\n\nMr. Rozell said that could create an opening for one of the lower-tier candidates to make their mark on the race.\n\nSouth Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has been lingering just behind the frontrunners and has recently showed a greater willingness to challenge his rivals, signaling he could take a more aggressive approach.\n\nMr. Steyer will get his first chance to introduce himself and his vision to a national television audience after entering the race late and failing to qualify for the three opening debates.\n\n\u201cTom will highlight what makes him different from other candidates on stage,\u201d Steyer campaign manager Heather Hargreaves said Monday.\n\nThe debate will feature 12 candidates \u2014 more than any of the previous candidate showdowns.\n\nRounding out the list of debate participants are: Sen. Kamala Harris of California; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; entrepreneur Andrew Yang, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke; and Rep Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.\n\nMs. Gabbard had threatened to boycott the \u201cso-called\u201d debate, accusing the Democratic National Committee and the corporate media of conspiring to rig the primary race. But she caved Monday and said she will attend.\n\nIt was the latest example of how struggling candidates have tried to gin up interest in their campaigns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still very early and although a lot has changed very quickly, who knows what the race will look like in another week or two?\u201d Mr. Rozell said.\n\n\u2022 Seth McLaughlin reported from Washington.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
