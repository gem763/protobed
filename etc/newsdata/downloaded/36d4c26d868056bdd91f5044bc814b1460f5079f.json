Here\u2019s a look at what we\u2019ve learned so far\u2026\n\nWho is Lottie Lion and how did she get to be on The Apprentice 2019?\n\nBorn to a Belgian family in North Devon, Lottie moved to a farm outside Dulverton where she showed her entrepreneurial verve by setting up a car-cleaning business as a 12-year-old before studying at Richard Huish College.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving moved to Taunton, where the college is based, she worked as a librarian at Bishop Fox\u2019s School, also setting up a national members\u2019 club for ladies in the countryside.\n\n\u2018We are a socially elite members\u2019 club,\u2019 she has explained. \u2018I brand it as that but it\u2019s more a luxury, an experience.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re open to the majority of females unless they are awful company, in which case we don\u2019t really want that. I\u2019m friendly, I\u2019m chatty, I like to think that I\u2019m approachable, but I don\u2019t see any point in carrying dead weight on my journey to the top.\u2019\n\nLottie\u2019s application to The Apprentice was fuelled by drinking wine while watching TV, and she is said to have forgotten about her interest in the show until she was chosen as one of 600 applicants to take part in auditions.\n\nOnce the shortlist had been narrowed down to 70 potential contestants, she passed a day of screen tests and a psychological assessment.\n\nShe felt she should have led the task and had some noticeably testy moments with the other women on her team, but was praised by Lord Sugar for her role in the challenge.\n\nDoes Lottie from The Apprentice know Lord Sugar?\n\nAs well as denying accusations of racism after comments from the cast\u2019s WhatsApp group leaked online, Lottie has been linked to Apprentice top dog Lord Sugar amid suggestions that her father\u2019s company can access the billionaire for speaking engagements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDominique Lion runs Leaders for Business, but a spokesman for Lord Sugar insisted to The Mirror: \u2018He doesn\u2019t know him. He has never heard of him. There\u2019s no connection between them.\u2019\n\nLottie frequently posts photos of herself living the high life on social media (Picture: Instagram / lottie.lion)\n\nLord Sugar, meanwhile, has made no personal mention of the claims, instead offering a typically curt observation on Lottie\u2019s early impact as a candidate.\n\nHe tweeted: \u2018Lottie is like a fine wine bouquet. It seems she gets up everyone\u2019s nose.\u2019\n\nLottie previously told the County Gazette: \u2018My nickname on social media is Marmite \u2013 people either love me or hate me.\n\n\u2018People think I\u2019m this character on the TV so it doesn\u2019t actually affect me. It does, but I\u2019m a strong person and I\u2019ve dealt with hate before.\u2019\n\nWhen is The Apprentice on next?\n\nFans can watch Lottie and the remaining contestants take part in a task based around ice lollies on BBC One at 9pm tonight.\n\nThe Apprentice: You\u2019re Fired follows on BBC Two from 10pm.\n\nThe Apprentice is next on BBC One at 9pm tonight.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
