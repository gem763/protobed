Now the age of fashion for space has arrived.\n\nOn Wednesday, Virgin Galactic, the company started by Richard Branson to take people to the edge of space aboard a rocket-powered plane, is unveiling sleek, high-tech garments that passengers will wear during their trips.\n\nThey are not spacesuits like the ones that NASA astronauts put on for rocket launches and spacewalks. Rather, they are one-piece jumpsuits like those worn by military pilots, with a design that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on the bridge of the starship Enterprise. They come with fancy underwear to help maintain comfort during the trip up and down .\n\n\u201cI think every single person who goes to space will be delighted with it,\u201d Mr. Branson said in an interview. \u201cI think the whole experience of going to space should be sexy. Our spaceships are sexy. Our mother ships are sexy. Our spaceport is sexy. And for younger people than myself, this suit is also sexy.\u201d", "description": "The outfits, which would look at home on the bridge of the starship Enterprise, come with a ticket to space that costs as much as $250,000.", "authors": ["Kenneth Chang"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/science/16SPACESUITS-loop-cover/16SPACESUITS-loop-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
