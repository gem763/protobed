We heard from Chuck Schumer on January 3rd before [the] inauguration: 'The intelligence community will find a way to get back at you,'\" she told Francis.\n\nHowever, the president's campaign is pushing back against the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. This week nearly 100 House Republicans signed on to a motion to censure House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Rep. Ralph Abraham, R-La. recently introduced a resolution to expel House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., from Congress. Plus, Axios is now reporting that the campaign spent over $700,000 on impeachment-related Facebook ads.\n\nREAD: WHITE HOUSE LETTER ANNOUNCING NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\n\"This is about disenfranchising the American people who are taking notice and are filling our coffers at the campaign,\" McEnany urged.\n\n\"Never in history...has an impeachment inquiry been brought forward without a vote of Congress, and this amounts to an unconstitutional inquiry,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"What person in this country would be expected to go into a courtroom without an attorney, without the right to cross-examine a witness, without the right to challenge evidence, without the right to present your own evidence?\" asked McEnany. \"That is what we call a kangaroo court that happens in dictatorships -- not in modern democracies. And, that is what Democrats are asking President Trump to do--it's wrong. And, the people are taking notice of that.\"", "description": "The House Democrats' impeachment inquiry is about \"disenfranchising\" the American people,\u00a0Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said Wednesday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/kayleigh-mcenany-FOX.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
