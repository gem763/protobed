I\u2019ve never seen anybody as insecure in my life and somebody found it so necessary to tear down\u201d his critics, said Sanford, who is running against Trump on a platform of returning the GOP to the party of fiscal discipline.\n\nHe pointed to Trump\u2019s acrimonious clashes with one-time allies like former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who Trump called \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general\u201d and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Rex Wayne TillersonDiplomats describe all-time low in morale at State under Trump Trump sends nomination for Russia ambassador to Senate Democrats eye Pompeo testimony MORE, characterized by Trump as \u201cdumb as a rock.\u201d\n\nBoth officials left the administration after clashing with Trump over policy decisions.\n\n\u201cJust go down the list. Tillerson is as dumb as a rock, though he ran one of the biggest corporations of the world,\u201d Sanford said.\n\n\u201cEverybody is stupid compared to him,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the insecurity. I don\u2019t know what daddy didn\u2019t do for him. I don\u2019t want to try to figure it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, there\u2019s some unhinged there. And I think it\u2019s on display every single day,\u201d Sanford added.\n\nTrump for his part has mocked Sanford and his 2009 sex scandal that forced him to resign as governor.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhen the former Governor of the Great State of South Carolina, @MarkSanford, was reported missing, only to then say he was away hiking on the Appalachian Trail, then was found in Argentina with his Flaming Dancer friend, it sounded like his political career was over,\u201d Trump tweeted last month when Sanford announced his candidacy for the White House.\n\nDespite the personal tensions, Sanford says Congress should censure and not impeach Trump.\n\n\u201cMy personal view is that censure is far cleaner,\u201d he told The Hill.\n\n\u201cWhat are you really after? If you want him out of office then arguably it\u2019s not the best route to go, which is why I think [Speaker Nancy] Pelosi [D-Calif.] had been reticent in the first place given her experience with Clinton,\u201d he said, referring to the political fallout of the 1998 impeachment of former President Clinton, which was credited with helping Democrats pick up House seats in the 1998 midterm elections.\n\n\u201cIf you want him out of office, I think it\u2019s a far clearer message for the House and Senate to condemn,\u201d Sanford said, predicting a censure resolution would be more likely to attract Republican votes than articles of impeachment.\n\n\u201cI think you more easily pick up Republican votes in a censure,\u201d he said. \u201cThey condemn, saying whatever it is is wrong but we\u2019re not going to make the final call, we trust the American public to do so in a matter of months,\u201d he said, referring to the 2020 election.\n\nSanford predicts Trump will thrive in the political chaos that will take over Washington in the midst of a highly partisan impeachment fight.\n\n\u201cThe problem of an impeachment is it sucks all the oxygen out of the room. There is no other subject and that\u2019s true in the event that this becomes full blown,\u201d he said of the House impeachment process.\n\n\u201cI think it, personally, plays right into the music that Trump wants to sing. The idea of setting up an us-against-them contest, a contest of personality,\u201d Sanford said, predicting that Trump will relish turning the impeachment debate into a personality contest between himself and Reps.

And I still don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.", "description": "Former South Carolina Gov.
