The former resident contacted a current homeowner, who used a drone to confirm it was a white car. Deputies then found the remains.\n\nThe National Missing and Unidentified Persons System says Moldt went to a nightclub in November 1997 but didn\u2019t appear intoxicated when he left alone.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It took 22 years, but a missing man's remains were finally found thanks to someone who zoomed in on his former Florida neighborhood with Google satellite images and noticed a car submerged in a lake.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/AP_17108615939184_c0-191-3167-2037_s1770x1032.jpg?496c2a4c2022810cb6be8a4b63647cb0d1c73977", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
