The selfie was taken just hours after she confirmed that she had miscarried.\n\nLooking back: Hilaria Baldwin reposted a throwback photo from her D&C surgery on Thursday as part of her paid partnership with the bodycare brand Nivea\n\nDocumenting her loss: Hilaria originally posted the selfies in April, just hours after she confirmed she had suffered a miscarriage\n\n'Many people think being soft is being weak, but I\u2019ve found true power in being vulnerable,' she wrote. 'When I decided to open up about my miscarriage I experienced this past spring, I was nervous to talk about it...but these hidden experiences in my life are only scary when I feel I cannot be open.\n\n'We are taught to be so private with our fertility journeys...that we only share the strength and success...not the challenges. We must be \"strong women,\" silently suffering through any negativity we experience along the way.'\n\nHilaria went on to say that opening up about her loss led to her realize that she was not alone and silence made her weak, not strong.\n\n'By choosing to be soft I became vulnerable, and through becoming vulnerable I found the truest strength. Not only within myself, but within our community,' she added.\n\n'This image is one that I posted of me going into my d&c surgery this past spring. I\u2019m excited to be partnering with @niveausa for their #rethinksoft campaign to help others see the power in soft and how it can actually unite us all #ad #niveausa.'\n\nCandid: The yogi also promoted the brand on her Instagram Stories. In her post, she wrote about how 'choosing to be soft' and opening up about her miscarriage made her stronger\n\nA D&C, also know as dilation and curettage, is a surgical procedure performed on some women after they have suffered a first trimester miscarriage.\n\nAccording to the American Pregnancy Association, around 50 per cent of women who lose a baby in the first few months of pregnancy have to undergo the procedure, and it is more likely to be necessary if the baby was lost after ten weeks.\n\nThe response to Hilaria's sponsored post was overwhelmingly positive, with many people praising her for her strength and sharing their own miscarriage stories.\n\nDespite the positive feedback, there were a few people who were confused as to why she was speaking about her miscarriage in an ad for body lotion.\n\n'What does lotion have to do with a miscarriage?' one person wrote. 'Not trying to be snarky. Just trying to figure out [the] relationship between an #ad for lotion and this experience.\n\nUpdate: Hilaria, who is pregnant with her fifth child, had a routine check-up on Thursday\n\nGreat news: The mother of four later shared a picture of her 4D sonogram, writing: 'Tiny person is growing wonderfully'\n\nRelief: Hilaria also wrote on Instagram Stories that the baby has a 'strong heart'\n\n'Wait, so you're using your miscarriage as a means to sell lotion? I'm shocked,' someone else commented.\n\nOne fan, however, appreciated Hilaria's paid partnership with Nivea.\n\n'I love that whenever you do a sponsorship, you can tell you truly stand behind the message of that brand,' the person wrote.\n\nAs part of her paid partnership, Hilaria also filmed a series of Instagram Stories videos in which she discussed how speaking out about her miscarriage made her stronger.\n\n'I used to think that strength was being quiet and keeping everything in and always showing a smiling face and always making everybody else think that you're OK,' she said.\n\nBaby on board! Hilaria announced on Instagram last month that she is expecting her fifth child. The new came five months after she suffered a miscarriage\n\nSurprise! Hilaria shared the news on Instagram on September 18 by posting a video of the baby's heart monitor line\n\n'Through my miscarriage that I had last spring, I learned that that's not always the case. That oftentimes being soft and being vulnerable and opening up actually makes you stronger.'\n\nHilaria explained that by being open about her miscarriage she found 'strength' and 'peace with a difficult situation.'\n\n'I am very proud that I shared, and I am very proud of all of you who have decided that that was the right choice for you to share. And I'm very proud of us that we realized that we don't have to be quiet anymore,' she added.\n\n'That it isn't something to be ashamed of. It's not something that you have to hold because it's common and we shouldn't be ashamed and we don't have to be quiet.'\n\nSwiping up on the last clip takes viewers to information about the campaign on Nivea's website.\n\nIn addition to the sponsored content, Hilaria shared a pregnancy update with her fans after her doctor's appointment on Thursday.\n\nHeartbreak: Hilaria shared this photo last April to reveal she was suffering a miscarriage\n\nHands full: Hilaria and her husband Alec Baldwin have four children together: Carmen, six, Rafael, four, Leonardo, three, and Romeo, 16 months\n\n'Baby looks wonderful! Strong heart!!' she wrote on Instagram Stories.\n\nThe expectant mom also posted a picture of the 4D sonogram that was taken during her ultrasound.\n\n'Tiny person is growing wonderfully,' she wrote. 'I have a secret obsession with gender reveal videos. Give me ideas. I should know in about a week or two, because I did the early blood test.\n\n'I'm gonna put a place to respond in my insta stories. Or you can give me ideas here, if you'd like.'\n\nHilaria announced last month she is expecting her fifth child with Alec.\n\nThe health and wellness expert \u2014 who already has Carmen, six, Rafael, four, Leonardo, three, and Romeo, 16 months, with Alec \u2014 explained that while it was early in her pregnancy, she wanted to avoid any speculation.\n\n'People poke around and try to find out what is going on. When you simply share what is happening, you take the story into your own hands and they tend to leave you alone more,' she wrote.\n\n'Secrets are only interesting when they are secrets.'", "description": "Hilaria, 35, has opened up about how publicly sharing that she suffered a miscarriage made her stronger as part of Nivea's 'Rethink Soft' campaign.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/22/19273802-0-image-a-42_1570139853776.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
