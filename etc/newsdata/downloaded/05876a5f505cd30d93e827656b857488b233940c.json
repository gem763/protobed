It\u2019s a sign that the product isn\u2019t changing year over year, sure. But more importantly, it\u2019s a promise that it\u2019s good, that it will do what you expect it to do, and that you don\u2019t need to overthink how it will fit into your life.\n\nNot very many products reach that level. Even the iPhone has ups and downs, with some years being a little more inconsistent than others. But minus a rough start and a cellular hiccup a couple of years ago, the Apple Watch has been on a very steady trajectory: slightly better every year. It starts at the same $399 price point as last year, and cellular or material upgrades will add to that cost.\n\nCompared to the Series 4, the Series 5 has only a few minor updates. Chief among them is a new always-on screen. Compared to the rest of the smartwatch market, the Apple Watch Series 5 is in a completely different league.\n\nOur review of Apple Watch Series 5 Verge Score 9 out of 10 Good Stuff Finally, an always-on screen\n\nBig, beautiful display\n\nNew apps round out its capabilities Bad Stuff Battery life hasn\u2019t improved\n\nStill no third-party watchfaces\n\nDoesn\u2019t work with Android phones Buy for $399.00 from Apple\n\nRelative to the Series 4, there are four new things on the Apple Watch Series 5. The first is that Apple is offering new materials for the casing. You can get it in the standard aluminum and steel, but you can also spend more for titanium or ceramic now.\n\nThere are some subtle weight differences on the more expensive materials, and they also have sapphire glass on the front of the Watch. But you should not spend the extra money on those more premium materials in the hope that they\u2019ll be better from a feature perspective. They\u2019re the same Apple Watch; you\u2019d just be paying more for something fancier. Some people like doing that!\n\nThe second new feature is the big update this year: an always-on screen. I feel like a lot of users have been asking for this since the very first Apple Watch was announced five years ago alongside the iPhone 6 and Apple Pay. It\u2019s something other smartwatches were already doing back then, and it was annoying that Apple didn\u2019t figure out a way to do it.\n\nNow it has, and in typical Apple fashion, it\u2019s saying it was able to do so because of some slick new screen technology that mitigates the usual battery trade-offs. Specifically, Apple says it can dynamically change the screen\u2019s refresh rate from as fast as 60Hz to as slow as 1Hz, updating just once per second.\n\nDoing that allows the screen to draw radically less power when it\u2019s in ambient mode. It also means that if you want an always-on display, you\u2019re going to have to pony up for the Series 5. It\u2019s not something that will be added to older models via software updates.\n\nThe technology that makes that possible is a low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO for short) display that Apple developed. The tech behind an LTPO version of an OLED screen is interesting \u2014 especially since it was first introduced in the Series 4 \u2014 but it\u2019s not something you really need to understand. The screen looks identical to the Series 4; it\u2019s just as big and bright.\n\nWhat last year\u2019s Watch lacks are the chips to control the refresh rate on that LTPO screen so it won\u2019t be able to do always-on. Specifically, the Series 5 has an \u201cultra-low power display driver, efficient power management integrated circuit and new ambient light sensor,\u201d according to Apple.\n\nI love the always-on screen on the Series 5. Apple\u2019s implementation is better than other smartwatches I\u2019ve used for two reasons: it legitimately doesn\u2019t hurt the battery life as much, and Apple keeps a little color visible in ambient mode.\n\nFor whatever reason, I\u2019ve never been able to get earlier Apple Watches to show their screens with subtle wrist movements. I\u2019ve always had to cartoonishly raise my arm. An always-on screen means I am a little bit less of a jerk in conversations and meetings.\n\nAn always-on screen was my number one feature request \u2014 it took five years, but we got it\n\nBut the big question is battery life: Apple claims it still gets 18 hours with standard use, and I have gotten that. So, box checked \u2014 except that the Series 4 usually outperformed that estimate. I won\u2019t go so far as to say that the Series 5 gets notably worse battery life than the Series 4, but at best, it\u2019s on par. You\u2019ll be charging it every day.\n\nBut let\u2019s not grade on a curve here. The Apple Watch is better than any other computer-on-your-wrist-style smartwatch by a country mile, but there are other watches with smart features that can last for days, weeks, or even months. The Garmins and Fitbits and Withings of the world are all meant for different things than the Apple Watch, but many can do some of the basics, like notifications and weather, nearly as well.\n\nThe last two new features on the Apple Watch Series 5 are a built-in compass and cellular bands that can work internationally. The former could be useful for day hikers, while the latter really only allows the cellular version to make emergency calls anywhere in the world. To get service in more places, you\u2019ll need to wait for Apple to make more carrier deals.\n\nSo to sum up: new case materials, new always-on screen, a compass, and more cellular bands. All in all, that\u2019s a very minor update. But the truth is that Apple could have done literally nothing, and the Apple Watch would still have been the best smartwatch for iPhone users by far.\n\nIf you have a current Apple Watch and are thinking of upgrading, I strongly recommend you wait for watchOS 6 to arrive for your current Watch. It might be good enough for you to hang on to what you have or, more rarely, these updates can make older Watches feel slower. Either way, it\u2019s worth it to wait a bit.\n\nThe big headline feature for watchOS 6 is that it has an independent App Store that allows you to download and install apps without needing your iPhone. It does exactly that, but make sure you have your iPhone handy the first time to enter some passwords. There will be other times when some of the apps will not work on your Watch until they can communicate with a paired app on your iPhone. Apple tells me that after watchOS 6 launches, many fully independent Watch apps will be available and featured on the main page of the Watch version of the App Store.\n\nI think the hope is that an onboard App Store may spur more usage and make supporting the Apple Watch more worthwhile to third-party developers. We\u2019ll see, but I\u2019m not holding my breath just yet. So far, it\u2019s been a moneymaker mainly for Apple. Apple has done a decent job of curating apps for the main page on the App Store, but otherwise, it\u2019s not as easy to browse as it is on your phone.\n\nThe new App Store on the Watch doesn\u2019t make it any more independent from the iPhone, however. You still need an iPhone to set up and use the Apple Watch, even if you have a Watch with an LTE connection and its own version of the App Store. This is still an accessory to the iPhone and not a truly independent device. Though, with watchOS 6, you can start to see the hazy outlines of that path.\n\nAlongside the App Store are a few new and updated apps directly from Apple. The most important in my mind is the new Cycle Tracking app for tracking menstrual cycles. It took Apple longer than it should have to prioritize features designed for the health of people who have periods. But now that it\u2019s here, it seems as though the company has done a good job.\n\nAgree to continue: Apple Watch Series 5 Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. For the Apple Watch, there are either more or fewer than you\u2019d expect, depending on your perspective. It\u2019s more if you assume that the stuff you already agreed to on the iPhone would transfer over; it\u2019s fewer if you figured you\u2019d have to agree to everything anew. Since the Apple Watch only works with the iPhone, you will already have consented to two mandatory agreements and (if you use Apple Pay), six optional ones.\n\nThere is a terms and conditions agreement specifically for watchOS, which you can have emailed to you. Apple has also helpfully put up a PDF of the version of the agreement for watchOS 6 here. Apple is transparent that many of the privacy settings you\u2019ve chosen for your phone will transfer over to the Watch. These agreements are mandatory, and you cannot negotiate them. There are several more optional agreements: If you transfer your Apple Pay cards to work on the Watch, you may have to agree to additional terms from your bank. In my case, Bank of America includes a location sharing provision and provides a link (which you have to manually type out yourself) to a PDF with more information.\n\nIf you set up cellular, you might have to agree to more terms from your carrier, but we couldn\u2019t test every one. Verizon, at least, didn\u2019t ask me to agree to additional terms, although it did ask for a $30 activation fee. Final tally: one mandatory agreement, two optional agreements for Apple Pay and cellular service, and in all three cases, these agreements extend other products that likely involved significantly more agreements.\n\nApple has taken a cautious approach. The complication doesn\u2019t show information, for example, and it won\u2019t be overconfident in guessing the dates for your predicted periods and fertility windows. If you\u2019re planning on using this to gather data for family planning purposes, you should talk to your doctor before acting on any of the data this app collects.\n\nApple also has put some thought and care into whether and when to show various Cycle Tracking options, depending on the age and gender information it knows. You can also turn certain types of tracking (like fertility) off if you want. There\u2019s a specific onboarding flow that happens on the phone only because it\u2019s better able to communicate information and nuance than your tiny Watch screen.\n\nAnd if you\u2019d like to remove the Cycles app entirely, for the first time, watchOS 6 will allow users to delete some of Apple\u2019s own apps from the Watch. (To do that, you need to have your app view set in the hexagonal grid view. Then, long-press any app to go into jiggly mode, at which point, you\u2019ll be able to tap an X to uninstall.)\n\nOther new apps include an updated Reminders app and a Voice Memos app, both of which sync automatically with their paired apps on the iPhone. There\u2019s also a Calculator app. (Why the Apple Watch has a first-party Calculator app while the iPad does not is a riddle for all iPad users.)\n\nThe Apple Watch can now also detect ambient noise. If it gets too loud, it will warn you, and it will also track your overall ambient noise level over time. It confirmed that the BART trains in San Francisco are ridiculously loud.\n\nApple put in a few new watchfaces, as usual. And as usual, I find them to be nice but always a few degrees off from what I actually want. I respect that Apple is opinionated about the aesthetics of the Apple Watch, but I\u2019m increasingly annoyed that it won\u2019t allow third-party watchfaces.\n\nHowever, Apple has finally made a change that I\u2019m over the moon about: on most watchfaces, when you set a custom color, it sets all of the complications to monochrome to match that color. I found too many of them to be garishly colorful before, and now I can tone them down to my preferred color.\n\nLast and (given its reputation) possibly least, Siri has a few small updates. It\u2019s able to recognize music when you ask for it, and it can present answers to questions with web links now, too. Yes, you can still open webpages on the Apple Watch. And yes, it\u2019s still as adorable as ever. Fortunately, it also still defaults to opening specific articles in Safari Reader Mode.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the cellular version, I can report that it works about the same in watchOS 6 as it did before, which is to say everything works, but it all feels just a little slower and worse than it would if you had your phone with you. Calls aren\u2019t as crisp, latency is a bit higher when using data, and, of course, it\u2019ll ding your battery more. But again, slightly worse than ideal for the Apple Watch is still many multiples better than most of the competition.\n\nIt is about time that Apple added an always-on screen to the Apple Watch Series 5, but that\u2019s not the best thing about it. Nor is it the LTPO technology that enables it or the new compass or the noise meter or any single one of the features I\u2019ve brought up in this review.\n\nThe best part of the Apple Watch is that I\u2019m able to talk about those features at all. Every other smartwatch I have used in the past few years (and, reader, I have used a lot) has failed to cross very basic thresholds of usability. Some don\u2019t last more than 12 hours, some can\u2019t seem to open apps in fewer than 10 seconds, some are hard to navigate, and some have really buggy software.\n\nThe lion\u2019s share of the blame for those issues lies with the various companies that have tried and failed to make great smartwatches. But I want to save some portion for Apple because it allows the Apple Watch to have deeper and better integrations with the iPhone than it will give to third parties. It automatically \u201cjust works\u201d with Apple\u2019s apps, notification frameworks, and \u2014 critically \u2014 iMessage.\n\nThat Apple integration cuts both ways. Because it\u2019s tied so closely to the iPhone, the possibility that it will ever be an option for Android users seems to be getting smaller. That\u2019s a shame because there are many, many more Android users, all of whom don\u2019t have great smartwatch options.\n\nApple is adding advanced features while everybody else struggles with the basics\n\nIn fact, look closer at the Android world, and you will see just how far ahead the Apple Watch truly is. Google\u2019s Wear OS platform is in the midst of its umpteenth strategic reboot, and it\u2019s not going well. Samsung\u2019s Tizen platform is better, but it has struggled to gain wider adoption among anybody but Samsung users. Fitbit has hung on to a loyal following for its basic fitness trackers, but its attempts at more advanced smartwatches have been disappointing.\n\nIt\u2019s as if the Apple Watch is in high school and taking AP courses while everybody else is repeating the 7th grade for the third time. Sure, the Apple Watch Series 5 hasn\u2019t reached anything close to its full potential yet, but right now, this thing is an overachiever.\n\nIt\u2019s an Apple Watch.\n\nVox Media has affiliate partnerships.
