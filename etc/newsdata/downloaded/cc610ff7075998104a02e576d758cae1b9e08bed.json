That's not in anyone's interest.\"\n\nDavid Curtis, honorary professor at the UCL Genetics Institute, University College London, said: \"This study clearly shows that there is no such thing as a 'gay gene'.\n\n\"There is no genetic variant in the population which has any substantial effect on sexual orientation.\n\n\"Rather, what we see is that there are very large numbers of variants which have extremely modest associations.\n\n\"Even if homosexuality is not genetically determined, as this study shows, that does not mean that it is not in some way an innate and indispensable part of an individual's personality.\"\n\nZeke Stokes, from the LGBT media advocacy organisation GLAAD, said: \"This new research re-confirms the long-established understanding that there is no conclusive degree to which nature or nurture influence how a gay or lesbian person behaves.\"", "description": "A large analysis concludes genetic make-up is a factor, but does not determine sexual behaviour.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4D1D/production/_108514791_lgbt.jpg"}
