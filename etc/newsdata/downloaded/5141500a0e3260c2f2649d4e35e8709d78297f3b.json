(Zhong Zhi/Getty Images)\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Lakers take the court on Tuesday for their season opener at the Staples Center, Kyle Kuzma won\u2019t be with them.\n\nKuzma, who suffered a stress reaction in his left foot in August while training with Team USA for the FIBA World Cup, was officially ruled out of the season opener against the Los Angeles Clippers, Lakers coach Frank Vogel said on Sunday. He was cleared for non-contact practice last week, however Vogel did not want to speculate how long it would take for Kuzma to be back to full health.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re just talking about ramping up his activity, and we\u2019re not going to look past two days from now, which is Tuesday,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to increase his workload and activities this week, and we\u2019ll see where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Frank Vogel gives an injury update on Kyle Kuzma and talks about when he'll decide on Opening Night starters. pic.twitter.com/bZGqFZ6S5A \u2014 Los Angeles Lakers (@Lakers) October 20, 2019\n\nKuzma averaged 18.7 points and 5.5 rebounds last season with the Lakers, his second in the league. Vogel said that the 24-year-old will likely start with either full-court work with sprinting or half-court work with full contact, but that the medical staff hasn\u2019t decided which route to take yet.\n\nWhen he is finally ready to go, Vogel said he plans to add Kuzma to the starting lineup with LeBron James and Anthony Davis \u2014 something he thinks can add a lot of versatility to their lineup.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably our third-best player, so to add him to the mix we can go a lot of different directions,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cIt probably gets more enticing to play Anthony [Davis] at the 5 with [Kuzma] out there and LeBron and a couple guards. But our 5s have been great. So, I\u2019m going to have what they like to call \u2018good problems\u2019 when he\u2019s back to full activity.\u201d\n\nWhile the news may not be what Kuzma wants to hear \u2014 Vogel said he\u2019s more than ready to get back on the floor \u2014 he knows there\u2019s no reason to rush his return.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been impatient since he left the USA Team,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cBut he understands that we\u2019re being smart about it, and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s on board with the plan.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "After hurting his left foot with Team USA this summer, Kyle Kuzma will miss the Lakers\u2019 season opener this week.", "authors": ["Ryan Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ju26FYteNe60qVNNNl3.wA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/40JXQWWEiNwoVfdZsBidTw--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/04218a00-f39e-11e9-baff-941f2cd9b7f2", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
