Two band members told the Cedar Rapids Gazette that a third band member, a woman was hospitalized with fractured ribs.\n\nAdministrators at the two schools announced earlier in the week that they had looked into the allegations, but they didn't say whether anyone would face punishment. Iowa's athletic director, Gary Barta, and his Iowa State counterpart, Jamie Pollard, released a joint statement saying members of both schools' bands had been subjected to \"rude, vulgar, and in some cases violent\" conduct at football games in recent years, and urging fans to stop the behavior.\n\nFOOTBALL FAN WHO REQUESTED BEER MONEY ON TV REVEALS HE'S RAISED $820G FOR CHILDREN'S CHARITY\n\nIn response, 21-year-old Corey Knopp, who plays tenor sax for the Iowa Marching Band, posted his account of the abuse following the game, which Iowa won 18-17.\n\n\"People were physically assaulted,\" Knopp said. \"We expect to get booed and cussed at. But never for violence to take place...Put yourself in our shoes. Kids. Marching in formation back to our busses after a long day. Getting shoved and having beer cans shaken and sprayed at our feet. Getting slapped because of the words on our uniform (IOWA). Getting pushed so hard that someone\u2019s (not going to name this person) ribs are broken. That is completely unacceptable.\"\n\nBERNIE SANDERS' IOWA POLITICAL DIRECTOR HAS LEFT CAMPAIGN, REPORTS SAY\n\nKnopp also detailed to the Gazette how an Iowa State fan shoved him as they were marching back to the team buses.\n\n\"He decided to cut through the band and shoved me out of his way. I yelled, \u2018Do not put your hands on me sir,\u2019 and he yelled back, \u2018F--k you.\u2019\u201d\n\nNathan Topping, a 19-year-old trumpet player, told the Gazette a full beer bottle was thrown at him, causing what he described as a \"nasty bruise.\"\n\n\"It was the fans,\" said Paige Pearson, 20, who plays trumpet in the Iowa band. \"The Iowa State band has been nothing but kind. They've reached out to us and said sorry this happened. It was not even the students, but adult fans.\"\n\nUniversity of Iowa spokeswoman Jeneane Beck said Friday that the social media posts made it clear that the university hadn\u2019t adequately conveyed to its students what it had done to address the band members\u2019 concerns, the Gazette reported.\n\n\u201cStudent safety is our number one priority and we are committed to ensuring a safe experience on game day for our students,\u201d Beck said. \u201cAdditionally we are continuing our investigation to ensure all of our students have the ability to share their experiences with the appropriate authorities.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIowa officials said Friday in a message to band members that Barta and Pollard \u201chave been actively engaged in the process and have publicly pledged to ensure better protections for students moving forward.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The University of Iowa\u00a0has reopened an investigation into allegations by members of the school's marching band that they were verbally abused and physically assaulted during last weekend's game against rival\u00a0Iowa State\u00a0University.", "authors": ["David Aaro", "David Aaro Is A Freelance Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Iowa-Hawkeyes-marching-band-Getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
