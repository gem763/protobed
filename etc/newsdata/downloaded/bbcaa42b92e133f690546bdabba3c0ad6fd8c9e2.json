Tweet @viaCristiano | @zackstanton\n\nGOOD AFTERNOON and welcome to POLITICO\u2019s Westeros Playbook, the must-read guide to what\u2019s happening on the continent. As the battle for the Iron Throne (and for the living) heats up, we\u2019ll deliver your briefing on what's driving the week.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nEXCLUSIVE: NORTHERNERS COOL ON JON SNOW: No honeymoon can last forever, and we expected Jon\u2019s support of Daenerys to get a frosty reception from Northerners. But even we weren\u2019t prepared for just how much they dislike the dragon queen -- and how quickly that has turned into a real threat to Jon\u2019s leadership.\n\nMoments after Dany arrived in Winterfell, key leaders from Jon\u2019s coalition of supporters gathered in the Great Hall. It was supposed to be a grand homecoming, where Snow would introduce his Targaryen queen, and grateful Northerners would thank her for bringing her army and dragons to their aid. Instead, the meeting turned ugly, with several of Snow\u2019s key supporters publicly airing their grievances about his latest moves. Here\u2019s the play-by-play, according to multiple sources inside the room:\n\n\u2014 Lady Lyanna Mormont stunned onlookers by telling Jon to his face that he \"left Winterfell a king\u2026 I'm not sure what you are now. A lord? Nothing at all?\" Even more surprising: the raucous applause she received from a group expected to be Snow\u2019s most loyal backers.\n\n\u2014 Snow\u2019s tepid response was to tout the multilateral military coalition he\u2019s built for the coming war. \u201cWe need allies, or we will die,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Tyrion Lannister, Dany\u2019s top strategist, isn\u2019t exactly her best surrogate. In an ill-conceived attempt to bolster Snow\u2019s claim, he assured the Northerners that they would be protected by the largest army in the known world. But there\u2019s one big problem with that\u2026\n\n\u2014 Lady Sansa Stark, whose dislike of Dany was apparent to all in the room -- and whose political skills have become apparent to all who\u2019ve observed her -- asked a practical question after Tyrion\u2019s speech: How are we supposed to feed this gigantic army in addition to feeding our own people? It\u2019s a simple, bread-and-butter message sure to resonate in the North.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Right now, Jon and Dany each have a narrative problem that has has the potential to become something more serious.\n\nHow Jon wants to be seen: Selfless, a man of his word, battle-tested and willing to do whatever it takes in order to protect his people, including bending the knee to Dany.\n\nHow Jon\u2019s detractors see him: Short-sighted, lacking in political savvy, and endlessly obsessed with his single-issue, military-focused political agenda.\n\nHow Dany wants to be seen: A liberator. A fair and just ruler whose successes have earned her the support of multiple armies and a coalition of once-great Houses.\n\nHow Dany is seen by Northerners: An occupier who has committed war crimes by burning alive POWs and who ordered the crucifixion of her political enemies in Meereen. An entitled outsider who feels it\u2019s her birthright to lead a people she\u2019s never known, sees them as her subjects and cares more about her own power than their well-being.\n\nRemember: Though the popular image of Jon and Dany depicts them as strong leaders, both have very mixed track records, and this wouldn\u2019t be the first time either of them faces ouster at the hands of the people they claim to lead.\n\nWho to watch: Sansa Stark is incredibly skilled at the sort of inside political game necessary to be an effective leader. In her time leading the North, she\u2019s won plaudits from even her staunchest doubters. With Jon\u2019s support now teetering, she could easily make a move to oust him -- especially if it\u2019s revealed that he isn\u2019t Ned Stark\u2019s son. If she does mount a leadership bid and is successful, where do Jon and Dany go from there?\n\nHOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON: Three close advisers to Dany and Jon \u2014 who are definitely not Varys, Tyrion and Davos Seaworth \u2014 told Playbook they spotted the two each riding dragons over Winterfell as part of a joint military exercise. While Daenerys rode the massive Drogon, named after her late husband Khal Drogo, Jon clumsily took control of the the still-pretty-huge Rhaegal, named after the late Prince Rhaegar Targaryen.\n\nMilitary analysts say the development bodes well for the North\u2019s anticipated clash with the Night King and the Army of the Dead, given that the latter suffer from a severe aversion to fire. And though unbeknownst to him at the time, Jon\u2019s pairing with Rhaegal bears special significance given his ancestry. (For more on that, keep scrolling through this scroll.)\n\nNED, YOU ARE NOT THE FATHER: It was only a matter of time before Jon found out that he isn\u2019t Ned Stark\u2019s son. His name isn\u2019t even Jon Snow; it\u2019s Aegon Targaryen. As previously reported, his mother was Lyanna Stark, Ned\u2019s late sister who died during childbirth, and Rhaegar Targaryen, eldest son of the mad king and oldest brother of the mother of dragons.\n\nHow he found out: Samwell Tarly is one of Jon\u2019s most trusted advisers, and one of of two people who knew the truth of Jon\u2019s parentage (the other being Bran). After Sam found out that Dany committed a surefire war crime by burning alive both his father and brother, both POWs, he was moved to tell Jon the truth. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been a bastard,\u201d Sam said, according to sources familiar with talks.\n\nBut why did Sam tell him? The strategy is hard to figure out. Was it to drive a wedge between Jon and Dany? Was it because he wants Jon to see himself as the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, and stop bending the knee?\n\nWhat does this all mean? Jon learning that he is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne could throw a Drogon-sized wrench into his relationship with Dany \u2014 and their plans to stave off the dead. Will Dany recognize his claim and bend the knee? Will Jon even press his claim to begin with? Or will the lords and ladies of Westeros finally put aside feudalism and take up a representative democracy in which rulers are decided through an electoral process? Only time will tell -- though probably a hard pass on that last one.\n\nThe big takeaway: Don't forget, Northerners aren't likely to overlook the fiery reception Jon's real grandfather -- Mad King Aerys Targaryen -- gave to late Lord Rickard Stark and son Brandon Stark when the two rode south years back and were burned alive. Informal surveys of Northerners indicate that the Targaryen family name remains as unpopular as that of the Lannisters -- yet another sign Jon may lose his grip on the North should he make his paternity findings public.\n\nSign up to receive the weekly Westeros Playbook newsletter: click here.\n\nCERSEI GETS HER GOLD: In a military contract on a scale Westeros has never seen, Queen Cersei secured the support of the Golden Company, as Euron Greyjoy transported more than 20,000 soldiers to Blackwater Bay outside King\u2019s Landing. According to government insiders, Capt. Harry Strickland, the commander of the forces, reportedly told the Queen that 2,000 horses also made the venture, but that he was unable to fulfill her rather bizarre request for battle elephants.\n\nWhat does Euron want in return? It\u2019s apparent to observers in the Red Keep that Euron Greyjoy wishes to marry Queen Cersei. Euron, alternately known and reviled for his crude, swashbuckling style and arrogant macho demeanor, has been known to alienate his allies by his sheer force of personality. But he apparently believes that this Kraken has found a way into the Lion\u2019s heart, judging from the queen\u2019s personal invitation for Euron to meet with her privately in her chambers. But Cersei is politically cunning in a way Euron\u2019s never encountered before -- something he may not realize.\n\nCERSEI-ING RED: Reports from the Red Keep are that the queen has knives out for brothers Tyrion (no surprise) and Jaime (big surprise). Tyrion has long been a target of Cersei\u2019s ire -- she\u2019s despised her younger brother literally from birth. But Jaime? Well, that\u2019s a genuine surprise. Those in the know tell Playbook that the queen has apparently authorized a top-secret special ops mission targeting the Lannister brothers with someone both men know and trust: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.\n\nYARA SIGHT FOR SORE EYES: After months in captivity, escaped POW Yara Greyjoy has been spotted captaining a small flotilla heading to the Iron Islands while her uncle\u2019s fleet is preoccupied doing the Lannisters\u2019 bidding. It\u2019s an aggressive move, but also hedging the bets: In Euron\u2019s absence, she could retake the Salt Throne as Balon Greyjoy\u2019s rightful heir while also securing the archipelago as a location of retreat if the army of the dead decimates things on the mainland \u2014 making the Iron Islands a hot commodity.\n\nTHEON-ORABLE THING TO DO: More than most, Theon Greyjoy has made major mistakes, from betraying his adoptive brother Robb, to falling prey to Ramsey Bolton, to peacing out when uncle Euron took his sister hostage. But after spearheading a genuinely surprising and successful stealth mission to free Yara, Theon has reportedly opt to bow out of a return to the Iron Islands to instead head to Winterfell to make right by the Starks and fight alongside them in the wars to come. How will he be received?\n\nARYA GLAD TO SEE ME?: Arya Stark has continued her triumphant return to public life in recent days, reuniting with a number of close allies. First up: Jon Snow, who at last meeting gifted the young Lady Stark a finely crafted sword that she dubbed Needle -- a weapon she holds to this day. The pair, who insiders say have long enjoyed a special connection as the black sheep of the family, shared a warm embrace upon their reunion and caught up on everything from a recent resurrection to a few (faceless) killings here and there.\n\nGiddy for Gendry: Stark relished another fateful reunion with Gendry, the bastard son of late King Robert Baratheon, with whom she fostered a special bond during their travels on the King\u2019s Road years back. The pair were spotted trading flirty glances by the forge in Winterfell. Could the pair rekindle their past connection and form a new power couple? And what is that mystery weapon which sources say Arya asked Gendry to make for her?\n\nHounded by the past: Arya also came face-to-face yet again with Gregor \u201cThe Hound\u201d Clegane, whom she last left on the side of a cliff to die following his bruising bout with Brienne of Tarth. The warrior duo, who have endured their fair share of bumps and bruises, figure to play a major role in the battles to come.\n\nTHAT\u2019S SO THREE-EYED RAVEN: Bran Stark continues to puzzle his family members with cryptic and foreboding messages, according to Winterfell insiders. Upon reuniting with Jon and meeting Dany, the greenseer flexed his chops by recounting details only an eyewitness would know about the Battle Beyond the Wall, where the Night King killed the dragon Viserion. But the situation is even more dire now, he reportedly told them, with the wall breached by an undead Viserion, and the Army of the Dead marching south.\n\n\u2018MEMBA ME? Bran came face-to-face with the man who left him paralyzed from the waist down years back: Ser Jaime Lannister. The meeting comes at a tenuous time for Jaime, who recently severed all diplomatic ties with longtime ally/lover/sister Queen Cersei Lannister. With Cersei planning to renege on her armistice with Jon and Dany, Jaime decided he finally had enough and rode north to aid the Stark-Targaryen coalition forces.\n\nBut if Jaime is expecting a warm welcome, he should think again. The North remembers. They remember the role Jaime and his family played in the execution of Ned Stark. They remember the Red Wedding, where Robb and Catelyn were killed. And you can bet they will help Jaime remember as well.\n\nJUST IN: REPORTS OF ANOTHER DEAD NED: The Army of the Dead came for Last Hearth, where the Umber forces awaited reinforcements for a last-minute retreat to Winterfell. Raven scrolls obtained by Playbook detail a grisly scene, with young Lord Ned Umber and the extremities of some of his men brutalized and mounted in a spiral pattern on a wall. The gruesome discovery was made by a coalition of Wilding, Night\u2019s Watch and Brotherhood forces.\n\nSign up to receive the weekly Westeros Playbook newsletter: click here.\n\nTHIS PLAYBOOK COULDN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT ... \"Game of Thrones\" author George R.
