Asked if he considered Mr Trump to be illegitimate, he said: \"Based on what I just said, which I can't retract.\"\n\nThe investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller concluded that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election \"in sweeping and systematic fashion\" with the goal of helping Mr Trump and harming Ms Clinton.\n\nBut the report drew no conclusion about whether the interference changed the result, and did not establish a criminal conspiracy by the Trump campaign.\n\nMs Clinton compared her election loss to \"applying for a job and getting 66 million letters of recommendation and losing to a corrupt human tornado.

So this is an effort to sow these falsehoods against Biden.\n\n\"And I don't care if you're for the [Democrats] or you're a Republican, when the president of the United States, who has taken an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, uses his position to in effect extort a foreign government for his political purposes, I think that is very much what the founders worried about in high crimes and misdemeanours.\"\n\nMs Clinton also predicted Trump would lose in 2020 because \"there were many funny things that happened in my election that will not happen again\".\n\nThe Washington Post", "description": "Hillary Clinton dismissed Donald Trump as an \"illegitimate president\" and suggested that \"he knows\" that he stole the 2016 presidential election in a CBS News interview to be aired on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/27/13/hillary-clinton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
