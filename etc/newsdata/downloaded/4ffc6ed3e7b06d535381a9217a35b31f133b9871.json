But he said AGL would prefer to be an equity investor in any gas supply venture rather than an operator, playing down any interest in buying ExxonMobil's 50 per cent stake in the Gippsland Basin joint venture which is for sale.\n\nMaoneng has developed the Sunraysia solar farm in southern NSW.

He confirmed the unit, which is seen critical for summer power supply, is on track to return to operation on December 16 as scheduled.\n\nShares in AGL, which is the country's largest power generator and one of the \"Big 3\" electricity and gas retailers, were down 4\u00a2 at $19.68 in early trading.", "description": "The batteries will be able to power up to 30,000 homes and be \"pivotal\" in the transition to clean energy, said AGL chief executive Brett Redman.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2614%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/21c058a8baa6c99023d31c97b66ad374c3160a44", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
