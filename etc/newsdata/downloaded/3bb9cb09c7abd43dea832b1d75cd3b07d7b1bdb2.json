(AP) - Operations were temporarily halted at a busy North Carolina airport Sunday night after it lost radar contact with an approaching small plane, launching a search around a densely forested state park nearby.\n\nA statement posted on the Raleigh-Durham International Airport website said air traffic controllers notified the airport that a small aircraft was lost on radar about 7:25 p.m. as it approached the airport. The statement added that airport firefighting units were immediately dispatched to the vicinity of William B. Umstead State Park, not far from the airport.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a brief statement saying the aircraft lost from radar contact was a Piper PA32. The FAA website said the single-engine plane typically has around six seats.\n\nThe FAA statement said the aircraft was approaching Runway 32, the smallest of three landing strips and perpendicular to what the airport considers its primary runway.\n\nAir operations were halted for about 20 minutes as rescue units rushed to the area, airport spokeswoman Crystal Feldman said.\n\n\u201cDuring that time we had our fire units responding to the incident, which allowed no planes to take off or land on our runway,\u201d she said at a news conference. \u201cFor about 20 minutes we had everything halted around the airport.\u201d\n\nFeldman couldn\u2019t say how many people were aboard the private aircraft.\n\nWith rescuers from 12 state and local agencies searching the area round Umstead State Park, Feldman said people were advised to avoid the approximately 6,000-acre (2,400-hectare) wooded expanse bounded by an interstate, the airport and a state highway.\n\n\u201cOur primary goal right now is to find this airplane,\u201d she said.\n\nAt a second news conference around 11 p.m., Feldman said that a highway patrol helicopter flying over the state park was scanning for heat signatures on the ground. She said the dense forest of the park, combined with the darkness, could slow the search.\n\n\u201cIt could take a very long time for us to find this plane,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cNo one is going home until this plane is found.\u201d\n\nThe president and CEO of the Raleigh-Durham Airport Authority, Michael Landguth, echoed Feldman, describing the state park as having \u201cfew roads and little to no light.\u201d He called recovery efforts in remote areas \u201cextremely challenging.\u201d\n\nThe airport\u2019s website showed that a number of arrivals were diverted beginning around 7 p.m., and departures were delayed. The airport said it resumed normal operations around 7:45 p.m.\n\n__\n\nFollow Drew at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Operations were temporarily halted at a busy North Carolina airport Sunday night after it lost radar contact with an approaching small plane, launching a search around a densely forested state park nearby.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jonathan Drew"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
