It may pass near Mars in October.\n\nThis would be only the second interstellar object ever observed in our solar system. The first such visitor, \u2018Oumuamua, took scientists by surprise in 2017. This time, they\u2019re getting ready to watch C/2019 Q4 with \u201ceverything\u201d they can, one astronomer said.\n\nIf C/2019 Q4 is indeed interstellar, scientists should be able to study the object until it grows too dim to see in early 2021.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nAstronomers may have spotted the second object ever to visit our solar system from another star system. The object may even fly near Mars later this year, though it\u2019s still far away.\n\nThe scientists\u2019 hunch is strong but not yet certain: Right now, the chances are much higher that the object, known as comet \u201cC/2019 Q4 (Borisov)\u201d (formerly \u201cgb00234\u201d), is interstellar, rather than a rock from within the solar system.\n\nThe first such interstellar object ever detected \u2013 the mysterious and controversial cigar-shaped space rock \u2018Oumuamua \u2013 zoomed through our solar system in 2017.\n\nAmateur Ukrainian astronomer Gennady Borisov may have been the first to spot C/2019 Q4 in the sky on August 30. It hasn\u2019t yet entered our solar system, but astronomers have been collecting data in hopes of plotting the object\u2019s path through space and figuring out where it came from.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so exciting, we\u2019re basically looking away from all of our other projects right now,\u201d Olivier Hainaut, an astronomer with the European Southern Observatory, told Business Insider on Wednesday. Hainaut was part of a global team of astronomers that studied \u2018Oumuamua as it passed through the solar system two years ago.\n\n\u201cThe main difference from \u2018Oumuamua and this one is that we got it a long, long time in advance, \u201d he added. \u201cNow astronomers are much more prepared.\u201d\n\nEarly images suggest C/2019 Q4 is followed by a small tail or halo of dust. That\u2019s a distinct trait of comets \u2013 they hold ice that gets heated up by nearby stars, which leads them to shoot out gas and grit into space. The dust could make C/2019 Q4 simpler to track than \u2018Oumuamua, since dust brightly reflects sunlight.\n\nThis could also allow scientists to more easily study the object\u2019s composition, since telescope instruments can \u201ctaste\u201d light to look for chemical signatures.\n\n\u201cHere we have something that was born around another star and traveling toward us. It\u2019s the next-best thing to sending a probe to a different solar system,\u201d Hainaut said.\n\nAstronomers are preparing to watch the object with as many telescopes as possible\n\ncaption The Very Large Telescope (VLT) is located in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. source ESO\n\nAstronomers around the globe are grabbing every telescope available to plot C/2019 Q4\u2019s path through space. The goal: See if the object has an orbit that\u2019s elliptical (oval-shaped and around the sun) or hyperbolic (checkmark-shaped, and on an open-ended trajectory).\n\nAs of now, it seems much more likely that its path is hyperbolic, though astronomers say more observations are required to know for sure. In particular, they\u2019re trying to ascertain C/2019 Q4\u2019s eccentricity, or how extreme its orbit is.\n\n\u201cThe error indicates it\u2019s still possible that\u2019s within the solar system,\u201d Hainaut said. \u201cBut that error is decreasing as we get more and more data, and the eccentricity is looking interstellar.\u201d\n\nThe object\u2019s seemingly high velocity and its comet-like shroud of dust also tilt the scales toward interstellar, Hainaut added.\n\ncaption This rough simulation shows C/2019 Q4\u2019s possible orbital path (green) through the solar system. It may pass between the orbits of Jupiter (purple) and Mars (orange) in late October. source OrbitalSimulator.com\n\n\u201cIt could be a few days or a few weeks before we have enough data to definitively say. But even with the very best data, we may need more,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating.\u201d\n\nWhen \u2018Oumuamua sped past Earth at a distance of just 15 million miles in October 2017, astronomers had no idea it was coming.\n\n\u201cWe had to scramble for telescope time,\u201d Hainaut said. \u201cThis time, we\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nIf it\u2019s interstellar, C/2019 Q4 would reach its closest point to the sun at the end of December, and scientists should be able to observe it through about January 2021.\n\nHainaut and his colleagues have some smaller telescopes queued up for observations, but he said he\u2019d like to use \u201ceverything\u201d to observe C/2019 Q4. His team is trying to get time on the \u201cbig guys\u201d: the Very Large Telescope in Chile, the Keck Observatory, the Gemini telescope in Hawaii, and more.\n\nHe said one colleague is also \u201cpolishing a proposal\u201d to have the Hubble Space Telescope take a look, while other teammates are seeking the use of NASA\u2019s two infrared space telescopes: Spitzer and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explore (WISE).\n\nScientists remain cautious about C/2019 Q4\u2019s identity, though\n\ncaption An artist\u2019s depiction of interstellar object \u2018Oumuamua. source ESA/Hubble; NASA; ESO; M. Kornmesser\n\nAlthough many astronomers are excited about C/2019 Q4, more work has to be done to confirm it as interstellar.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first object since 2017/1I, better known as \u02bbOumuamua, to show a hyperbolic orbit,\u201d Michele Bannister, a planetary astronomer at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nBannister noted that, with such limited observations, an object can appear to have a rare interstellar orbit but later turn out to have an orbit within our solar system.\n\n\u201cSometimes, we just have to wait for the motion of the heavens. And make more observations,\u201d she added.\n\nCurrently, those observations aren\u2019t easy to get, Hainaut said. C/2019 Q4 is currently positioned close to the sun \u2013 which places it close to Earth\u2019s horizon and gives astronomers a very limited window of time before dawn to study it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see, but we have the best guys doing astrometry, trying to measure its position in the sky,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be a few days or a few weeks before we have enough data to definitively say.\u201d\n\nRead more: Mysterious space objects like \u2018Oumuamua will visit our solar system again. Scientists may intercept the next one with a robotic probe.\n\nIf C/2019 Q4 does turn out to be a second interstellar object, that would bode well for a proposed mission Hainaut is working on to send robotic probes into space to intercept future objects like this.\n\n\u201cOne of the main issues is: How many of these are they? If we detect one every century, it\u2019s hard to plan a mission to intercept one,\u201d he said.\n\nIf these objects come every couple of years, on the other hand, astronomers might even be able to get choosy about which object to intercept.\n\n\u201cThis suggests we can afford to wait one or two or three years to get the right one, and maybe not the first one we spot after organizing a mission,\u201d Hainaut said.", "description": "Business Insider - If the comet-like object has interstellar origins, \"it's the next-best thing to sending a probe to a different solar system,\" one astronomer said..
