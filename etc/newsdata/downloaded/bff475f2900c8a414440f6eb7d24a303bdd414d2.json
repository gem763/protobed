And as measured by the Federal Reserve, with the output shrinking over two consecutive quarters this year, the US manufacturing sector is now in a recession.And according to the index drawn from purchasing managers, September\u2019s drop-in manufacturing was the steepest since 2009, with production, inventories and new orders all dropping.The problem with the manufacturing recession, is that it will, create a domino effect which will, lead to other sectors falling. Take this year\u2019s rail road sector for example\u2026The drop in carloads for large US railroads increased to 5.5% in the third quarter. Shipments are down with coal, grain, chemicals, consumer goods, and autos.This makes it the biggest drop in three years, according to the weekly reports from the Association of American Railroads.And with the US-China trade war making shippers more anxious and cautious with their freight orders \u2013 this will continue to add to the cargo crumble.And so, we\u2019ve confirmed that a recession in one sector can lead to a recession in another.But more importantly, when it comes to America I like to measure its performance based on its biggest stock market with over 500 US companies listed. I\u2019m talking about the S&P 500.Looking at the weekly chart of the S&P500, you can see the price has been making higher highs since January 2018. However, the RSI indicator hasn\u2019t\u2026The RSI or Relative Strength Index is a popular indicator used for when you buy or sell trades.All you need to know is the RSI measures the speed and change of market price movements. And if you can compare the movement in the share price versus the movement on the RSI, you\u2019ll be able to \u2018probability\u2019 predict which way the market will go.For this article, there is one signal on the RSI that is showing major downside to come for the S&P500. I\u2019m talking about the Negative Divergence that has formed.The negative divergence is when the price of the market moves up, while the RSI falls simultaneously. This means, the momentum to the upside is slowing down and we can expect the market to drop to its next strong floor level (support level).In this case, the next target for the S&P500 is set to fall to 2,400. And so, looking at the chart above we can conclude three things for today\u2019s chart analysis\u2026The market price of the S&P 500 has been moving up.The RSI has been falling (hence a negative divergence).The next strong floor level (support level) is at 2,400. This means we can expect a 20% drop on the S&P 500 in the next couple of months.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Timon Rossolimos covering: S&P 500.
