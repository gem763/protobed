Mourinho is assisting Zidane at the moment \u2013 every time he is rumoured to be taken over, senior players who don\u2019t seem to want him back, play twice as well.\n\nToni Kroos celebrates with team-mates Marcelo and Eden Hazard after giving Real Madrid the lead in Galatasaray\n\nThe German midfielder fires into the top corner via the shin of sliding Galatasaray midfielder Jean Michael Seri\n\nMATCH FACTS Galatasaray: Muslera, Luyindama, Donk (Feghouli 45), Marcao, Mariano, Nzonzi, Seri, Nagatomo, Belhanda (Bayram 67), Andone, Babel Subs not used: Ozbayrakli, B\u00fcy\u00fck, Inan, Kocuk, Feghouli, Mor Booked: Seri, Nzonzi, Mariano, Marcao Goals: None Real Madrid: Courtois, Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Marcelo, Valverde (Rodriguez 77), Casemiro, Kroos, Rodrygo (Jovic 82), Benzema, Hazard (Vinicius Jr 79) Subs not used: Areola, Milit\u00e3o, Isco, Mendy, Booked: None Goals: Kroos (18) Referee: Daniele Orsato\n\nKroos was excellent throughout and got the all-important goal but Courtois played a big part in the result too. He saved three times in the first half as Galatasaray had their chances in a very open first 45 minutes.\n\nFirst they broke clear on nine minutes when Florin Andone got goalside of Sergio Ramos. Courtois saved well to his right and when the same player flashed another shot goalwards from the corner Courtois saved well again.\n\nSurprise starter Rodrygo Goes had began brightly and it was the 18-year-old who forced a save from Fernando Muslera. He ran on to Benzema\u2019s pass but shot at the goalkeeper. Benzema went close too as Madrid threatened.\n\nThe goal came on 18 minutes. Hazard and Benzema worked a one-two inside the Galatasaray penalty area. When Hazard laid the ball back to Benzema it was behind him but Kroos ran on to it and, with a shot that took a deflection off of Jean Michael Seri, beat Muslera.\n\nGalatasaray were still threatening but Madrid were switched on in every position. There was even a moment when Marcelo raced back into the area to make a timely covering clearance.\n\nThibaut Courtois dives down to his left to save Younes Belhanda's first-half shot at Turk Telecom Stadium\n\nFormer Chelsea star Eden Hazard looks to dribble past Galatasaray defender Mariano during the Group A match\n\nYounes Belhanda was found by Ryan Babel, who had skipped past Fede Valverde down the left, but although his shot was was well-hit, Courtois got down well, this time to his left, and made the save.\n\nThe Turkish side brought former West Ham midfielder Sofiane Feghouli on at half time but the tide did not turn and when Kroos put Benzema through it needed a good save from Muslera to prevent the second.\n\nBenzema then sent Hazard sprinting through. It was as fast as Hazard has moved since his arrival and this on the hour mark with players tiring. His shot was saved but it was another sign of the understanding growing between the Belgian and Benzema.\n\nUnder-pressure Los Blancos manager watches on from the dugout during the Champions League group stage match\n\nReal Madrid captain Sergio Ramos dribbles the ball out of defence looking to build another attack in Istanbul\n\nOn 65 minutes their connection left the crossbar shaking. Valverde played the ball into Benzema. He played it in to Hazard who dodged the onrushing Muslera but smacked his shot against the frame of the goal.\n\nGalatasaray continued to struggle and when Belhanda was taken off he responded to the crescendo of jeers aimed at him but very visibly giving plenty of verbal abuse back as he walked off the pitch.\n\nJust short of the 80 minute mark Zidane made his changes. The impressive Hazard was replaced by Vinicius and the excellent Valverde was surprisingly swapped with the far more attacking James Rodriguez.\n\nThe more obvious change was 18-year-old Rodrygo who then went down with cramp and became the third change replaced by Luka Jovic.\n\nMadrid saw out the final minutes and with Club Brugge beaten by PSG qualification looks back in their hands.\n\nEden Hazard hit the crossbar after rounding Garatasaray goalkeeper Fernando Muslera in the second half", "description": "PETE JENSON IN ISTANBUL: Thibaut Courtois saved, Eden Hazard sprinted, Toni Kroos scored, and so Madrid took the folder marked 'crisis' and filed it away for another day.", "authors": ["Pete Jenson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/23/20058620-0-image-a-2_1571782512810.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
