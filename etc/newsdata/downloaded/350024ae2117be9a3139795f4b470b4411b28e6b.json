Their jubilation was understandable \u2013 Genk is a family club from a small industrial city in Limburg with a 31-year history, yet there they were standing at the summit once again.\n\nOld Trafford equaliser can reignite my Liverpool career, says Adam Lallana Read more\n\nAs the fans and players celebrated, the club had no choice but to move on and quickly concern itself with one simple question: what happens next?\n\nThere are few leagues in Europe like the Belgian Pro League. Over the past five seasons, four clubs have won the title. The difference in income between the top teams is relatively small and even then, Genk were the fifth-richest club last season. Finishing fifth, the season before seemed to help the squad greatly as the players flew low under the radar. With sufficient breathing space to develop as a team, they soared.\n\nThis year, they have no such fortune. For a team like Genk, who host Liverpool in the Champions League on Wednesday, success presents a showroom for the bigger clubs and the vultures are always there to lure their players away.\n\nGenk are no strangers to the ephemeral nature of football. The walls of its academy are lined with photos of the countless young players the club has produced or developed, including Kevin De Bruyne to Thibaut Courtois. As soon those players are close to fulfilling their talent, they are gone.\n\nFor Koen Daerden, technical director at the Genk youth academy, the commitment to youth and to the technical, intelligent players is a key pillar of their philosophy: \u201cWhat we are doing is all about vision from the youngest, under-7 till under-21,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s one line. We continuously have to change our manner to look forward ... but the philosophy stays the same. It\u2019s to give young people time, to be patient.\u201d\n\nGenk\u2019s biggest departures at the end of the season were their captain, Leandro Trossard, now at Brighton, Ruslan Malinovskyi and the manager, Philippe Clement. It could have been worse. The club spent a nervous summer anticipating transfers for their other talismans; the Tanzania striker Mbwana Samatta is an intelligent finisher who scored 32 goals last season and the 6ft 4in Norwegian Sander Berge, 21, bossed most midfields. In the end, they decided to remain for one more year.\n\nWith the additions of Th\u00e9o Bongonda and two 20-year-olds in Ianis Hagi, son of the great Romanian midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, and the Colombian defender Carlos Cuesta, it could even be argued that they are even stronger.\n\nBut Genk sit in sixth. The attempts of the manager, Felice Mazz\u00f9, to focus on defensive stability have been relatively successful. On Saturday, after an acrid 1-0 away defeat to Standard Li\u00e8ge, the usually cool Mazzu brandished a screenshot of a contentious decision to a journalist. The pressure is clearly mounting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of our club,\u201d says Darden. \u201cWe know that we have to build again after a championship, after a few good years. With a new coach, with other young, developing players like Hagi. They take some time.\n\n\u201cThree years ago, we had first-class players who were sitting on the bench in the beginning and in the end they made us champions.\u201d\n\nBelgian football is not immediately known for the behaviour of its crowds, but perhaps it should be. During the celebrations in a Genk club, Trossard led the fans as they belted out a pitiful, childish homophobic cheer that has spread across the league in recent seasons, aimed at Club Brugge: \u201cAll farmers are gays\u201d. During the inevitable apology, his excuse was that he was drunk.\n\nIn the bitter Limburg derby against Sint-Truiden, Genk relinquished a 3-0 away half-time lead for 3-3. All the while, the Genk goalkeeper, Ga\u00ebtan Coucke, was pelted with bottles and lighters while the Genk fans broke the plexiglass screen erected to separate them and their flares from the pitch.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe match was abandoned and now the possibility of fines, deducted points and closed-door games loom. Both teams blame the other.\n\nIn their previous two Champions League appearances, Genk have played their home and away games like two different clubs. They have been battered 5-0, 6-0 and 7-0 away to Chelsea, Real Madrid and Valencia, but they held each team to solid draws at home. There has been little difference this year. A terrified Genk was ravaged 6-2 away by Red Bull Salzburg, but Mazz\u00f9\u2019s defensive focus was justified by a spirited 0-0 home draw with Napoli. They are chasing their first win.\n\n\u201cThis is the KRC Genk that you will see more often in the future, said Hagi after Napoli. \u201cThe newcomers are gradually starting to find their way. I think it is normal that something like this can take a few months, but beautiful moments are coming.\u201d\n\nHagi will face Liverpool on his 21st birthday. It seems impossible, but there would be no greater stage to produce one of those beautiful moments and mark a first certain step towards wherever this club is heading to next.", "description": "Genk, the Belgian champions, are committed to developing youth but it means they can be vulnerable", "authors": ["Tumaini Carayol"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06565c801f40f5afe0d78ec77f205ca61ad4dee7/13_121_2128_1277/master/2128.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=04682c2a9197217f08d2317ed07bcbfb", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
