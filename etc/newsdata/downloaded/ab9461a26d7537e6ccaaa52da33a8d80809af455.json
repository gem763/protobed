While it seems practically every day of the year is now designated national something day \u2013 left-handers, bring-your-pet-to-work, middle child, etc. \u2013 there remain a handful of designated days each year when Americans still pause to commemorate significant elements of our national identity. Today should be one of them.\n\nIt\u2019s probably fair to assume that every military conflict in human history has resulted in people being captured, unaccounted for, or missing. The term \u201cprisoner of war\u201d traces its roots to the 17th Century. In the United States, efforts to honor and remember those captured or missing are most often associated with the Vietnam War. Since Vietnam, public ceremonies and private vigils by families across the nation have honored the memory of those whose sacrifice for our freedom did not end when hostilities ceased. Indeed, the most recent estimate is that there are still 1,592 American personnel unaccounted for.\n\nOver the decades, many organizations have taken up the noble cause of honoring and remembering our nation\u2019s POW/MIAs. One of the most visible manifestations of their work is the POW/MIA \u201cMissing Man\u201d remembrance table, nearly ubiquitous in military and VA facilities.\n\nSadly, not even the time-honored tradition of memorializing our POW/MIA\u2019s is without controversy these days. A Missing Man table in the Manchester, NH VA Medical Center is the subject of a lawsuit because it includes a Bible. A private organization, the Northeast POW/MIA Network, created and maintains the Missing Man table at the Manchester VA Medical Center.\n\nEach item on a remembrance table carries symbolic significance. Historically, the Bible represents the strength gained through faith, of the POW and his or her loved ones.\n\nThe Bible that sits on the Missing Man table in the Manchester VA Medical Center lobby isn\u2019t just any Bible. It belonged to Herman \u201cHerk\u201d Streitburger, who spent time in a German POW camp during WWII before his daring escape. Herk\u2019s Bible symbolizes the faith and prayers that sustained him throughout his captivity.\n\nNot everyone appreciates Herk\u2019s service to our nation, or his Bible. According to the activists supporting the lawsuit to remove Herk\u2019s Bible, it \u201cis a grotesque gang sign of fundamentalist Christian triumphalism, exceptionalism and supremacy.\u201d\n\nBut the Constitution does not require us to purge all religious symbols\u2014whether monuments, flags, statues, or books\u2014simply because one or more observers claim to be offended. Far from it, the First Amendment to the Constitution actually forbids such religious hostility. The Supreme Court even recently said so in a case upholding the constitutionality of a cross-shaped WWI veterans memorial.\n\nBut the fact that historic displays continue to be the subject of litigation demonstrates a larger issue; one that is as much about our culture as it is our legal system. If we must censor our history to assuage the sensibilities of modern day clairvoyants who \u201csee\u201d offense in all corners of the public square the rest of us cannot, we lose the ability to learn from our history, all of our history\u2014good, bad, or indifferent.\n\nEven after wars as controversial as Vietnam, Americans have been able to come together to honor those who were willing to fight and die for our freedoms. Few things unite us more than the sorrow we feel for the families of those whose love ones were never returned from battle or who suffered as prisoners of war.\n\nThis POW/MIA Recognition Day, let us honor men like Herk Streitberger. There aren\u2019t enough Herks left in the world. His generation\u2014the Greatest Generation\u2014sacrificed more than most of us can fathom for the very freedoms that are now under attack. But religious freedom was not one of them.\n\nMike Berry is Chief of Staff for First Liberty Institute, a legal organization dedicated to defending religious freedom for all Americans.", "description": "Today, September 20th, is designated as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. .09/20/2019 1:11:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Mike", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/239/eb0b6873-c758-42ab-b85b-bf747dfd22cf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
