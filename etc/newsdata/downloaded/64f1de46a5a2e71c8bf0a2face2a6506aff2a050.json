(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nThe Senate passed a stopgap spending bill Thursday to keep the government open through Nov. 21, punting tough decisions about President Trump\u2019s border wall and other funding disputes until just before Thanksgiving.\n\nThe 82-15 vote came days before the Sept. 30 deadline when government funding would expire if Congress didn\u2019t act. The House passed the same measure last week, so the Senate\u2019s passage of the short-term spending bill means it will now go to Trump for his signature. He is expected to sign it.\n\nThe stopgap bill is aimed at giving lawmakers more time to finalize $1.4 trillion worth of full-year spending bills for fiscal 2020, which ends Sept. 30, 2020. The bipartisan vote on the spending measure came despite a Capitol in chaos over House Democrats\u2019 new impeachment inquiry of Trump and a whistleblower complaint against Trump related to a call he had with the president of Ukraine.\n\nLike last year, when Congress denied Trump some of the money he was seeking for his U.S.-Mexico border wall, border barrier funding remains a major sticking point in budget talks. Democrats oppose Trump\u2019s $5 billion request for the wall and offered an amendment in the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday to block the money. But the amendment was defeated. Lawmakers will have to continue negotiating the issue before the short-term spending package expires in November.\n\nLast winter, the dispute over the wall ended up in a 35-day partial government shutdown.\n\nThis year, there are also unresolved divisions on other issues, including how much money should be devoted to domestic programs championed by Democrats, as opposed to Pentagon operations that are a priority for Republicans.\n\nThe disputes have arisen even though lawmakers and the administration came together over the summer to agree on a sweeping two-year deal that set top-line budget numbers and suspended the debt ceiling until after the 2020 election.\n\nIt remains uncertain how Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry will affect budget talks, but Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) said this week that the result could be additional short-term \u201ccontinuing resolutions\u201d like the one passed Thursday \u2014 instead of a bipartisan deal on new spending levels.\n\nShelby said he is meeting with Trump on Friday to discuss how to move forward with the appropriations process.\n\n\u201cMy message is a discussion about where we are and how we can move these bills,\u201d Shelby told reporters at the Capitol Thursday. \u201cWhere we are, and where we think we could go. Listen to him, too.\u201d\n\nWith the start of the 2020 fiscal year days away, Congress has yet to pass any of the 12 spending bills that must be signed into law annually. Funding the government is Congress\u2019 must basic task but the process often descends into dysfunction, a reality lamented by lawmakers of both parties, who tend to blame each other for the mess.", "description": "The action came days ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline, when agency budgets would have expired absent congressional action. The bipartisan vote came even as partisan clashes raged elsewhere in the Capitol over House Democrats\u2019 new impeachment inquiry and Trump\u2019s interactions with the president of Ukraine.", "authors": ["Erica Werner", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On Economic Policy", "September At Pm", "Erica Werner Has Worked At The Washington Post Since", "Covering Congress With A Focus On Economic Policy.
