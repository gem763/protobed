McGahn II\u2019s name, but they\u2019ll likely live with his legacy for decades to come.\n\nAs White House counsel for the first 21 months of President Trump\u2019s term, McGahn helped push through lifetime appointments for more than 100 conservative judges, including the successful nominations of Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nMitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, credits McGahn with accomplishing a key Republican priority, and Stephen K. Bannon, Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, says McGahn engineered one of the administration\u2019s most durable accomplishments. \u201cWhy the left is triggered by Trump is because they understand they\u2019re in a Kafkaesque nightmare, that Donald Trump is going to be in their personal lives 10, 20 and 30 years from now \u2013 and the reason is Don McGahn,\u201d Bannon says on the latest episode of \u201cThe Weekly.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s critics are worried that even if Democrats manage to take back the White House and control of the Senate in 2020, \u201cthere is a third branch of government that\u2019s been taken over by one party,\u201d says Brian Fallon, a former Hillary Clinton aide.\n\nOur reporters look at McGahn\u2019s success in reshaping the American judiciary, which won him praise from conservatives, and they examine his falling-out with Trump over McGahn\u2019s role in the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, where he was the most cited witness in the Mueller report.\n\n[Join the conversation about @theweekly on Twitter and Instagram. #TheWeeklyNYT]\n\nFeatured Reporters", "description": "As White House counsel, Don McGahn helped reshape the federal judiciary for a generation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/universal/27theweekly-mcgahn-mcgahn/27theweekly-mcgahn-mcgahn-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
