In Phase One, Buttigieg milked $32 million from 390,000 donors, most of whom knew next to nothing about his record, but were bowled over by a guy under 40 who can speak in complete paragraphs, sometimes in Norwegian. Phase Two was learning that Buttigieg has no strong and unique governing vision. We also learned his South Bend record on race relations as mayor, however well intentioned, is checkered. Phase Three, which so far has been a series of boasts about the campaign\u2019s field operation, does nothing to solve the problems of Phase Two.\n\nBut his campaign will keep going for months thanks to those swooning donors, who don\u2019t reflect actual voters. You may have seen Democratic presidential candidates categorized as \u201cwine track\u201d and \u201cbeer track.\u201d Political analyst Ron Brownstein popularized those labels, observing that the \u201cbrainy liberals with cool, detached personas and messages of political reform\u201d on the wine track tend to lose in Democratic presidential primaries to candidates with support \u201crooted in the blue-collar and minority communities\u201d on the beer track. But six months after Buttigieg wowed the Democratic donor class in a CNN town hall, and four months after he peaked at 8 percent in the RealClearPolitics poll average, Buttigieg can\u2019t even crack the wine track. Instead, he seems to be pioneering a new campaign lane: the \u201ccraft beer\u201d track.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bill Scher", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": ""}
