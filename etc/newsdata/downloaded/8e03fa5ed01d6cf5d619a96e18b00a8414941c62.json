A written summary of the call was released by the Trump administration on Wednesday.\n\nThe whistleblower report, citing multiple U.S. officials, said senior White House officials intervened to \u201clock down\u201d records of the call especially the official word-for-word transcript.\n\n\u201cInstead the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature,\u201d the report said. \u201cOne White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of soliciting a foreign power to smear a domestic political rival. The Ukraine controversy follows U.S. intelligence conclusions that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election with a campaign of hacking and propaganda to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nDuring a three-hour Intelligence Committee hearing, the top U.S. intelligence official, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, said the whistleblower had acted in good faith and followed the law in bringing the complaint, which was dated Aug 12.\n\nThe call to Zelenskiy occurred after Trump ordered a freeze of nearly $400 million in American aid to Ukraine, which the administration only later released. Before the call, Ukraine\u2019s government was told that interaction between Zelenskiy and Trump depended on whether the Ukrainian leader would \u201cplay ball,\u201d the whistleblower said.\n\nTrump reacted with fury after the hearing and assailed Democrats for their impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cWhat ... Democrats are doing to this country is a disgrace and it shouldn\u2019t be allowed. There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nThe identity of the whistleblower, a person within the U.S. intelligence community, has not been made public. In the report, the whistleblower said that \u201cI was not a direct witness to most of the events described\u201d and based the account on information from colleagues.\n\nThe New York Times, quoting three people familiar with his identity, reported that the whistleblower is a CIA officer who at one time was detailed to work at the White House.\n\n\u2018CLOSE TO A SPY\u2019\n\nThe New York Times and Los Angeles Times reported that Trump told staff from the U.S. mission to the United Nations he wanted to know who provided information to the whistleblower.\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information. Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d the Los Angeles Times quoted Trump as saying based on a recording of his remarks made by a person who attended the event in New York. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s concerns did not end with Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelenskiy. The next day, the report said, Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker and Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland met with Zelenskiy and other Ukrainians and advised them \u201cabout how to \u2018navigate\u2019 the demands that the president had made of Mr Zelenskiy.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly suggested wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter but has offered no evidence. There has been no evidence that Biden used his position to help his son, who had worked for a company drilling for gas in Ukraine.\n\nThe complaint stated that multiple U.S. officials said they were \u201cdeeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giuliani\u2019s circumvention of national security decision-making processes to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth between Kiev and the president.\u201d\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire is sworn in to testifify before a House Intelligence Committee hearing on the handling of the whistleblower complaint in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 26, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans criticized the report. \u201cClearly a coordinated effort to take second-hand information to create a narrative damaging to the President,\u201d Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said in a statement.\n\n\u2018GOOD FAITH\u2019\n\nAt the hearing, despite comments by Trump and other Republicans, Maguire said there was no reason to believe the whistleblower was disloyal to the United States or a political hack.\n\n\u201cI believe the whistleblower and the inspector general have acted in good faith throughout,\u201d he said, also referring to intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who determined that the whistleblower allegations appeared credible and were of urgent concern.\n\n\u201cI think the whistleblower did the right thing. I think he followed the law every step of the way,\u201d Maguire said.\n\nMaguire frustrated committee Democrats when he declined to say whether he had discussed the whistleblower complaint with Trump. Maguire said it would not be \u201cappropriate\u201d for him to publicly rebuke Trump\u2019s attacks on the whistleblower.\n\nMaguire testified about the document after refusing for weeks to share it with Congress. Democrats said federal law required that the report be sent to lawmakers.\n\n\u201cI have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way in the matter that is before us today,\u201d Maguire testified. Under questioning, he acknowledged this was the first time a whistleblower complaint was not shared with Congress.\n\nMaguire said he had not immediately released the report out of concern for \u201cexecutive privilege,\u201d a legal doctrine protecting certain executive branch communications.\n\nMaguire said he did not know who the whistleblower was and that he would work to ensure the individual\u2019s anonymity is protected and that the individual not face retaliation.\n\n\u2018INFORMATION WARFARE\u2019\n\nAdam Schiff, the Democratic committee chairman, grilled Maguire about why the whistleblower report was withheld. Trump, Schiff said, \u201chas betrayed his oath of office, betrayed his oath to defend our national security and betrayed his oath to defend the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you are seeing in the actions of this president is not democracy. It is the very negation of democracy,\u201d Schiff said as he ended the hearing.\n\nRepresentative Devin Nunes, a close Trump ally who is the committee\u2019s top Republican, blasted Democrats for pursuing the matter, as well as media reports about the call and whistleblower report.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate the Democrats on their latest information warfare effort against the president,\u201d Nunes said sarcastically.\n\nSaying more than six White House officials had made contact about Trump\u2019s communication with Ukraine, the report cited concerns that efforts to put pressure on Ukraine \u201cpose risks to U.S. national security,\u201d undermining efforts \u201cto deter and counter foreign interference in U.S. elections.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower complaint cited two instances that might have a connection with \u201cthe overall effort to pressure Ukrainian leadership.\u201d The complaint stated that Trump instructed Vice President Mike Pence to cancel his trip to Ukraine to attend Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration in May, sending a lower-level Cabinet member instead.\n\nThe officials told the whistleblower it was \u201cmade clear\u201d Trump did not want to meet with Zelenskiy until he saw how he \u201cchose to act.\u201d The complaint also noted that Trump earlier that month ordered suspension of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.\n\nSchiff also said the committee expected to hear from the whistleblower and Atkinson. Maguire and Atkinson met behind closed doors with the Senate Intelligence Committee later on Thursday.\n\nMaguire said the greatest U.S. intelligence challenge is protecting the integrity of elections, federal, state and local. He said it would be \u201cunwelcome\u201d to have outside interference in a U.S. election, adding, \u201cNo person in the country is beyond the reach of the law.\u201d\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the House has the power to impeach a president for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanours.\u201d No president has ever been removed through impeachment. Democrats control the House and Republicans control the Senate.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nThe United States has been giving military aid to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The $391.5 million in aid at issue in the current controversy was approved by Congress to help Ukraine deal with an insurgency by Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country.\n\nThe call to Zelenskiy occurred after Trump ordered a freeze of the military aid. The whistleblower report said an official from the White House informed departments and agencies on July 18 that Trump had issued instructions to suspend all security assistance to Ukraine. Neither the White House budget office or National Security Council staff \u201cknew why this instruction had been issued,\u201d the report said.", "description": "A whistleblower report released on Thursday said President Donald Trump not only abused his office in attempting to solicit Ukraine's interference in the 2020 U.S. election for his own political benefit, but that the White House also tried to \"lock down\" evidence about that conduct.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434209457&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1ET", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
