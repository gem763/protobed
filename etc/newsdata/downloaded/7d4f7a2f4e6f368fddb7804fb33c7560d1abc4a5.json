On the other hand, a plethora of teams stood pat at Tuesday's 1 p.m. PT deadline, both for good and bad reasons.\n\nHere in the Bay Area, the 49ers upgraded exponentially with the addition of wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders. The Raiders made several moves in previous weeks, including trading for wide receiver Zay Jones while shipping cornerback Gareon Conley off to Houston.\n\nWith the trade deadline over, here are three winners and three losers from around the league.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWinners\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\n\nThe 49ers have an elite defense and a two-headed monster in their backfield with Matt Breida and Tevin Coleman. There was one missing ingredient and general manager John Lynch didn't waste any time.\n\nSan Francisco acquired Sanders one week ago in a trade with the Denver Broncos. Coach Kyle Shanahan didn't waste any time getting Sanders involved in his offense, too. He played nearly every snap Sunday in the 49ers' 51-13 win over the Panthers and made an immediate impact.\n\nSanders had four receptions for 25 yards and a touchdown in his 49ers debut. He instantly became the team's No. 1 receiver and is a sure-handed option for quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo.\n\nLynch and Shanahan aren't messing around. They have the Super Bowl on their minds.\n\nNew England Patriots\n\nAs if the 8-0 Patriots needed more help. Well, that's exactly what they got in receiver Mohamed Sanu, who they acquired in a trade with the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nNew England added Sanu before the 49ers' trade for Sanders. Lynch admitted San Francisco was in on both receivers, and Sanu seemed like a perfect fit as a big slot receiver who has played for Shanahan in the past.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 49ers and Patriots could be on a collision course to the Super Bowl. If that's the case, Robert Saleh's defense will have to slow down a player San Francisco had its eyes on.\n\nBaltimore Ravens\n\nOakland's own Marcus Peters was traded from the Rams to the Ravens two weeks ago, and it already looks like a great move.\n\nPeters recorded a pick-6 in his Ravens debut in a 30-16 win over the Seahawks and didn't allow a single catch. He excels in zone coverage and fits the Ravens' scheme much better than the Rams' man-heavy defense.\n\nThe Ravens could face the likes of Tom Brady, Deshaun Watson, Patrick Mahomes or Jacoby Brissett in the playoffs. They need a stout defensive backfield, and Peters might be the perfect addition.\n\nLosers\n\nCincinnati Bengals\n\nWhat the hell is going on in Cincinnati? The 0-8 Bengals seem to have no plan and absolutely blew it at this year's trade deadline.\n\nQuarterback Andy Dalton was benched Tuesday -- literally on his 32nd birthday -- for a rookie named Ryan Finley (?), and that was their most sane move of the day, because it actually was a move. This team is going nowhere this season. They have to focus on the future, which the Dalton benching shows. But every other decision shows their incompetence.\n\n#FreeAJGreen was trending Tuesday, and for good reason. The Bengals wouldn't trade the star receiver, who is set to become a free agent this offseason, because, well ... who knows.\n\nFigure it out, Cincy.\n\nWashington\n\nSpeaking of incompetence, say hello to the Washington Football Team.\n\nWashington has held on to one of the best trade pieces in the league all season long, just to start taking calls on offensive tackle Trent Williams 48 hours before the deadline and ultimately hold on to him.\n\nThe one quote that stands out talking with league sources on possible Trent Williams move - Redskins wouldn't take calls on a trade for months, \"nobody wants to bail them out now.\" \u2014 JP Finlay (@JPFinlayNBCS) October 29, 2019\n\nWilliams, who has made seven straight Pro Bowls, requested a trade months ago. Washington refused and he hasn't played a single game this season. Even if he does hit the field this year, this was another L in Washington.\n\nAs long as they keep their name, this franchise will be on the wrong side of doing the right thing. Dropping the ball with Williams is just the latest example.\n\nDenver Broncos\n\nReceiving a third- and fourth-round draft pick from the 49ers for Sanders, who is due to be a free agent this offseason, was a solid haul for the Broncos. But general manager John Elway is stuck in the middle without a sense of reality.\n\nTrading Sanders shows Elway understands the 2-6 Broncos should go through a rebuild. Holding onto impending free-agent cornerback Chis Harris Jr. shows he truly doesn't know the direction of this team.\n\n[RELATED: Why Sanders compared studying 49ers' offense to college]\n\nThe Broncos reportedly were looking for a heavy haul from teams in order to trade Harris. The reality is, that wasn't going to happen for a 30-year-old who is under contract for $12.5 million this season before free agency.\n\nIf there was a 6-foot-9 quarterback available, then Elway might have made a deal. But Brock Osweiler already retired.\n\nNFL trade deadline winners, losers: Teams that made best, worst moves originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "The 49ers were clear winners at the NFL trade deadline this season.
