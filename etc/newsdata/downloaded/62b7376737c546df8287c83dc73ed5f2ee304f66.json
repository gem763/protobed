Some party leaders want to focus on flipping white voters who helped Trump flip Great Lakes states including Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Others want to drive turnout across Democrats\u2019 growing base of minority voters and college-educated whites in the suburbs and cities, constituencies that could put states like Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona in play, while also helping in the Upper Midwest.\n\nGeorgia has added 2020 emphasis because both of its Senate seats are on the ballot, including a surprise special election because Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson is retiring.\n\nGroh-Wargo did not put a price tag on a 2020 campaign in Georgia, but noted the combined Democratic investment in Georgia last year was $42 million, compared to $70 million in Ohio and $32 million in Iowa, where Democrats lost statewide midterm races two years after Hillary Clinton lost to President Donald Trump by nearly double-digit margins.\n\nAbrams\u2018 play Monday also underscores her rising influence in the party. She was a rock-star candidate against now-Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican. After her loss, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer of New York tapped her to deliver Democrats\u2019 response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address and tried unsuccessfully to coax her into challenging Republican Sen. David Perdue in 2020.\n\nIn recent months, Abrams has met personally with at least nine Democratic presidential candidates and launched a drive for voter protection hotlines in 20 states, while enjoying speculation that she\u2019ll be on any nominee\u2019s short list for vice president \u2014 particularly if former Vice President Joe Biden, a 76-year-old white male, wins the nomination. Central to Biden\u2019s pitch is his perceived appeal with white moderates and swing voters who voted for Trump in those Midwestern battlegrounds.\n\nIn the packet sent Monday, Abrams took pains to say she doesn\u2019t want to \u201cdiminish the importance or winnability of any state,\u201d and the memo, which Groh-Wargo wrote, said Democrats should reject \u201cfalse choices\u201d between chasing white Obama-Trump voters and Democratic-leaning minorities who are considered unlikely voters.\n\nBut the documents laid out in detail the case that Democrats\u2019 greatest potential gains are found in the latter groups, particularly in Georgia.\n\nIn 2018, Abrams got 1.92 million votes, about 45,000 more than Clinton in 2016, but 60,000 shy of Kemp\u2019s 1.98 million. That continued Democrats\u2019 upward trends in a state where Republicans had been winning statewide races by about 200,000 votes, with the GOP\u2019s presidential totals stabilizing between 2 million and 2.1 million since 2008 while Democratic totals climbed.\n\nThe shift is mostly about demographics: The state\u2019s nonwhite population is growing faster than its native white population. Georgia\u2019s electorate, for example, is now about a third African-American, a higher proportion than any of the perennial presidential battlegrounds.\n\nGroh-Wargo wrote that Abrams was able to take advantage because the campaign spent time and money reaching Democratic-leaning residents who aren\u2019t regular voters. With new registrations since 2018, Groh-Wargo put that number of such voters for 2020 at 1.7 million - more than six times the GOP\u2019s typical advantage in Georgia and about 28 times larger than Abrams\u2018 margin of defeat last year.\n\nThe universe of truly persuadable \u201cswing voters\u201d in Georgia, Groh-Wargo wrote, is about 150,000. Groh-Wargo said the campaign spent money targeting those voters, but not as much as in traditional campaigns that would have relied heavily on expensive television advertising in the Atlanta market.\n\nMeanwhile, urban and suburban whites in Georgia have trended to Democrats - a combination of new residents moving in and some realignment, as in other states, among college-educated white women disenchanted with Trump. Rural whites have moved even more overwhelmingly to Republicans. But in aggregate, Groh-Wargo, that means Abrams still garnered more of the white vote in 2018 than other recent Democrats at the top of the ticket.\n\nThe takeaway for national Democrats, Groh-Wargo said, is that campaign messages, infrastructure, advertising and one-on-one outreach cannot be focused on a narrow universe of swing voters and erstwhile Democrats who aren\u2019t coming back.\n\n\u201cDemocratic committees, consultants and the media do not factor unlikely voters into their polling, strategy and prognostications, effectively making their analyses by re-litigating the prior election as if nothing had changed in the electorate since,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAbrams herself added a bottom line: \u201cWe can win Georgia, and we can win across the nation in 2020.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Georgia's Stacey Abrams dove headlong Monday into Democrats' debate over how to win in 2020, urging her party's leaders and presidential candidates to treat her diversifying state as a key battleground and replicate nationwide her 2018 effort to bring new minority and young voters to the polls rather than chasing white voters the party lost long ago.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bill Barrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/04/03/National_Action_Network_Convention_22365.jpg-4995b_c0-6-5184-3028_s1770x1032.jpg?d408dfdb15f11a25fe9c176b8c444340aca79168", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
