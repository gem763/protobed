The U.K. proposes to do that by keeping Northern Ireland closely aligned to EU rules for trade in goods, possibly for an extended period.\n\nJohnson thinks the concessions should resolve the concerns that prompted British lawmakers to reject the previous Brexit deal three times.\n\nHowever, Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn said no Labour Party legislator can back the new Brexit proposal. Corbyn said in Parliament that the new plan is just a \"rehashed version\" of previously rejected ones.\n\nHe said the prime minister is not acting in good faith and knows the proposal will be rejected, adding the new proposal would gut European Union worker protections and environmental protections and set off a \"race to the bottom.\"\n\nJohnson would likely need some Labour Party backing to win passage of any new Brexit deal, as his government doesn't have a working majority in Parliament.\n\n'U.K.'s proposals fall short'\n\nEuropean Union Leader Donald Tusk said he was \"still unconvinced\" about the British proposals to unblock the stalled Brexit negotiations.\n\nTusk had telephone talks with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and joined him in his skepticism about Johnson's proposals. Tusk said his message to Varadkar was that the EU stands \"fully behind Ireland.\" In sharp contrast, he coined his message to Johnson as \"we remain open, but still unconvinced.\"\n\nToday I had two phone calls on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a>, first with Dublin then with London.<br>My message to Taoiseach <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeoVaradkar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LeoVaradkar</a>: We stand fully behind Ireland.<br>My message to PM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a>: We remain open but still unconvinced. \u2014@eucopresident\n\nFor his part, Varadkar said Ireland \"may have to live with a no-deal [Brexit] for a period of time\" if no compromise is found. He said he wouldn't predict any outcome of the Brexit talks but would prefer to \"see a deal where the U.K. leaves in an orderly fashion.\"\n\nThe European Parliament's supervisory Brexit group issued a damning verdict on Johnson's proposals and said they \"do not match even remotely\" what is needed for a compromise.\n\nAfter being briefed by EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who was given the proposals on Wednesday, the Brexit Steering Group said the proposals were a step back instead of forward toward an overall deal as the Oct. 31 deadline looms ever larger.\n\nThe statement from the group said that \"the U.K.'s proposals fall short and represent a significant movement away from joint commitments and objectives.\"\n\nThe statement carries weight since the steering group unites experts from all major groups in the European Parliament and the legislature has to approve any Brexit deal before it can become official.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson sought Thursday to build a coalition at home to back his fresh Brexit approach even as key European leaders declared that the measures he just proposed fall far short of the concessions needed to forge a deal.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5308014.1570134288!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/britain-brexit.jpg"}
