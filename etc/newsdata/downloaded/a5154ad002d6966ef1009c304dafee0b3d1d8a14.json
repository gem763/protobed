(Submitted by Sharlene Ridguard)\n\nWhy is the school doing it?\n\nIn a statement, school principal Marie-Jos\u00e9e Coiteux said the ban was put in place to address concerns about the impact of cellphones on student learning and health.\n\nThe school\u2019s governing board discussed the policy in June and presented it to some parents in late August before everybody was informed by email.\n\nAlthough Jeremie doesn\u2019t love the idea that cellphones are banned during personal time, the Secondary 4 (the equivalent of Grade 10) student said he thinks there are benefits to an all-day ban.\n\nThat includes cutting out a major distraction during class. \u201cYou actually have to listen to the teacher, God forbid.\u201d\n\nA cellphone ban will encourage students to pay attention in class, says 15-year-old Jeremie Besson. (Submitted by Anni Mills)\n\nBut Kaena, who is in Secondary 3 (Grade 9), said she isn\u2019t sure whether the ban will help with learning.\n\nAnd the fact that students can\u2019t use their phones anywhere on school property goes too far. \u201cThat\u2019s our time,\u201d she said.\n\nStudent concerns\n\nKaena said she can\u2019t stop worrying about how the new rule will impact her day.\n\nThe kids in her art class are \u201cas loud as elephants,\u201d she said, so she likes to listen to music while she works. Now she can\u2019t do that.\n\nKaena is also responsible for getting her brother on the bus in the morning, which is right next to school property.\n\nHer routine involves texting her mom to let her know that everything\u2019s OK on her way across the school field \u2014 but now that\u2019s against the rules, too.\n\nFines for breaking the rules and pulling out your cellphone in the halls at St. Thomas High School in Montreal range from detention to suspension. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)\n\nKaena said she\u2019s gotten in the habit of checking for emailed assignments from teachers during the day, in case her Wi-Fi isn\u2019t working at home.\n\nNow she\u2019ll have to go to the school library to do that, she said, and there are only a few computers to go around.\n\nEven checking the clock in class is proving to be difficult, Kaena said.\n\nThe whole thing is \u201ckind of annoying,\u201d she said.\n\nJeremie said there are some things he\u2019ll miss, such as playing games on his phone between classes. \u201cIt calms me down.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also going to be harder to connect with friends without his phone, he said, because \u201cthat\u2019s how you form connections.\u201d\n\nThe first province-wide school cellphone ban is set to begin in Ontario this November. (CBC)\n\nThe consequences\n\nKaena said kids at her school are already sneaking their phones out during the day when they aren\u2019t supposed to.\n\nShe said she hasn\u2019t risked it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get grounded.\u201d\n\nDepending on how often you break the rules, the punishment varies from detention to suspension.\n\nOther Canadian schools have tried banning cellphones before. In some cases, those bans have been reversed.\n\nIn November, Ontario will be the first to put a province-wide ban in place, although exceptions will be made for educational reasons.", "description": "Students at a Montreal high school react to a new policy that bans cellphones during the school day \u2014 even during personal time.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/NEWCellphoneBan_thumbnail_V2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
