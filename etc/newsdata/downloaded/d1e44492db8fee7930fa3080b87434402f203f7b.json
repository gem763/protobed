On the pitch the Ukrainian is \u201cunpredictable\u201d and \u201ca little bit different,'' according to his team-mates. Off it, he is the literal joker in the West Ham dressing room: a laughing, smiling character whose cheerful disposition was not even darkened by the Achilles injury that forced him to miss 10 months of competitive football.\n\n\u201cHe is always in a good mood,\u201d said Pellegrini. \u201cIt was exactly the same when he knew that he had a big injury and he would be out for six or seven months. He is the first one to be joking. As a character, he always helps the team.\u201d\n\nYarmolenko\u2019s mischievousness extends beyond the West Ham dressing room. Before their recent victory over Manchester United, he had struck a deal with a member of club staff: if he scored a hat-trick, the Ukrainian said, then his colleague would have to shave his own head. When Yarmolenko subsequently fired in the opening goal after 44 minutes, there was a minor sense of panic in the stands.\n\nYarmolenko did not score three in the end, but he did finish the day as West Ham\u2019s man of the match. It was the same a week later against Bournemouth when he was once again his side\u2019s most dangerous attacker. \u201cHe is able to be one of the best midfielders in the league,\u201d said Pellegrini. \u201cHis quality and the way he is playing is showing that he is a top player.\u201d\n\nFor West Ham, Yarmolenko\u2019s form at the start of his second season in England is providing some belated justification for his hefty transfer fee. The 29-year-old cost \u00a317.5 million when he arrived from Borussia Dortmund last year, but he made only 10 appearances before tearing his Achilles tendon against Tottenham Hotspur in October.", "description": "Andriy Yarmolenko is the joker in Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s pack, in both senses of the phrase.", "authors": ["Sam Dean", "Jason Burt", "Chief Football Correspondent", "Paul Hayward"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000210462658-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq5ZVGvukE11kbhMRgvMyFVuJZFW7o2MVBBtzW6Kw55hc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
