And there\u2019s no better way to celebrate the 70th Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party than with a massive military parade and a speech by President Xi Jinping.\n\nCertainly the party has reasons to party. They control everything: the government, the armed forces, and the economy. They rule over a country that stands as a world-class diplomatic and economic power and a rising military one.\n\nOn the other hand, the party faces some rising problems, too. Here are the top five.\n\nWreaking havoc in Hong Kong. Months of protests and rioting continue, with no signs of stopping. To explain the discontent, Beijing is pushing a new line: The cries for freedom, it seems, are rooted in the high-cost of housing.\n\nThere is no doubt that steep housing costs weigh heavily on the younger generation, but that\u2019s not what has brought people to the streets and kept them there. The protests are rooted firmly in the legitimate fear that Beijing\u2019s heavy hand will encroach on their political and economic freedom.\n\nThe Hong Kong protests have sullied China\u2019s brand. The regime continues to undermine the integrity of the Basic Law, which requires Beijing to respect the freedoms of the Hong Kong people. Every day of protest reminds the world that China doesn\u2019t keep its promises.\n\nOppressing the Uyghurs. The party has thrown a million members of this Muslim minority community into heavily guarded camps. A million! This brutal treatment places China among the globe\u2019s leading oppressors of religious liberty and other human rights.\n\nSuch behavior further sullies the party\u2019s brand. Complaints about Chinese abuses headlined the session on religious persecution chaired by President Trump at last week\u2019s meeting ofthe United NationsGeneral Assembly.\n\nHijacking the U.N. Human rights abuse wasn\u2019t the only charge leveled at Beijing at the General Assembly meeting. Many are waking up to the fact, that the Chinese Communist Party has been systematically placing its people in U.N. organizations with the express purpose of bending the agencies to advance China\u2019s preferred polices.\n\nChina is shifting outcomes to \u201cbenefit Chinese priorities and ideology,\u201d writes my Heritage colleague Brett Schaefer, a leading expert in U.N. operations. This heavy-handed practice is gaining global attention and losing China friends.\n\nLetting the Mask Slip from the BRI. China sold its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as Beijing\u2019s gift to the world \u2014 a way to help others share in China\u2019s prosperity. That narrative is wearing thin. Increasingly, BRI looks like economic imperialism.\n\nAlarmed, more and more countries are blocking BRI investments. Others are looking to counter balance Chinese presence by increasing U.S., European, and Japanese investments in their countries.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just BRI that has made the world suspicious of Chinese economic activity. Corporations like the telecom giant Huawei are increasingly viewed as instruments of Chinese power, not just benign global companies that sell stuff cheap.\n\nThe Communist Chinese Party has no one but itself to blame for sullying the reputation of Chinese economic activity. Rather than introduce an alternative to the free market system, all they have done is demonstrate how to be the world\u2019s biggest global cheat, exploiting the markets through intellectual property theft, corruption, unfair trading practices and non-tariff barriers.\n\nSlowing China's economy. After roaring for several decades, the dragon has a sore throat. Heritage economic analyst Riley Walters summarizes the state of China\u2019s economy this way:\n\nChina\u2019s economic growth has been slowing down. Despite two decades of increased trade and investment, China\u2019s economic development will plateau before ever reaching high-income status. With an aging population, significant amounts of debt, and few economic allies, China\u2019s economy is in severe need of reform.\n\nPut another way, the Communist Party\u2019s economic policies are running out of runway. They won\u2019t be able to steal, cheat, and bully their way to a world-class economy. That means China will have to make some hard choices in the not-too-distant future.\n\nThey won\u2019t be able to meet the rising expectations of their citizens, continue to fund a military build-up to threaten the U.S. presence in the Indo-Pacific, and pay for all their global meddling. Something has to give. And, ultimately, if they want to keep their economy growing, they will have to adopt the free market reforms and fair practices the party has been actively suppressing.\n\nLet the regime parade and party all they want. But if the party rules for the next 70 years like they govern now, its members will wind up with a massive hangover and the sad realization that they have fewer friends, less wealth and less power.", "description": "In Beijing, they are partying like it\u2019s 1949.
