She said in a recent post: \"I'm used to posting Instagram vs reality posts and not just the reality. It gave me a sense of security to have the 'Instagram' version of me next to the reality one. So today I'm just posting the reality.\"\n\nVictoria Spence\n\n\"I just want every woman to feel good about themselves,\" says Spence, who's based in Manchester, UK, in her Instagram bio.\n\n\"While it's amazing to post your best self, if you're truly online to help people, it's important to get real,\" Spence, 24, told Insider.\n\n\"When a follower can turn on Instagram to see you chatting away about how you get a camel toe in your gym leggings but you own it anyway, or how you have just tried on a pair of mom jeans from last year which now fit as a rather tight skinny jean, but weight gain happens, it helps people feel better about themselves, knowing nobody is perfect and they're not alone.\"\n\nVanja Wikstr\u00f6m\n\nSwedish influencer Wikstr\u00f6m uses the hashtag #letskeepitreal to encourage her followers to show their reality, as well as their Instagrammed side.\n\nShe posts photos of herself, her family, food, and her home, like many influencers, but is sure to throw in a dose of unfiltered outtakes from time to time.\n\nMalin Bj\u00f6rk\n\nSwedish personal trainer Bj\u00f6rk regularly posts side-by-side pictures showing how a change of lighting or angle can completely alter a person's appearance.\n\nWhilst a lot of fitness influencers feel they can only post photos that fit in with an outdated idea of how healthy should look, Bj\u00f6rk's photos remind people that you can have cellulite, stretch marks, and bum dimples and still be fit and strong.\n\nKim Britt\n\nBritt mocks Instagrammers for their often ridiculous photo set-ups, and adds what the real-life equivalent would actually entail.\n\nThe Swiss influencer's account is called \"The Truth is Not Pretty,\" where she shows that, for example, puppies are cute but you still have to clean up their poop, scarves can look great in the wind but sometimes they blow in your face, and more often than not, baths aren't glamorous and it's actually just awkward trying to shave the backs of your legs.\n\nRead more:\n\n33 Instagram accounts to follow in 2019 that will actually make you feel good about your body\n\nBeing an Instagram influencer is hard work, and people who hate on them are just jealous\n\nAn Instagram travel couple say the 'stupid beyond belief' photo of them hanging off a cliff was 'not dangerous'", "description": "For every perfectly-angled, edited, glamorous shot, there are at least a dozen less flattering versions.", "authors": ["Rachel Hosie"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7bb394f4fc2403985fbac7-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
