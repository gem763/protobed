So, all of the charts are in short-term downtrends.\n\nThe stochastic levels, however, are now oversold on all but the S&P and Nasdaq 100, but have not given \"bullish crossover signals\" at this point.\n\nHigh \"volume at price\" (VAP) levels are supportive on all but the Dow Transports where it is resistant.\n\nSource: Worden\n\nData Now Mixed\n\nAll of the one-day McClellan Overbought/Oversold Oscillators are now in oversold territory (All Exchange:-69.42 NYSE:-58.59 Nasdaq:-82.3). We would note they are capable of readings sometimes well below -100.\n\nThe detrended Rydex Ratio (contrary indicator) is a neutral +0.37 as is the percentage of S&P 500 stocks trading above their 50-day moving averages dipping to 48.1%.\n\nYesterday's AAII Bear/Bull Ratio (contrary indicators) remained neutral at 30.33/32.30 with the Investor's Intelligence Bear/Bull Ratio (contrary indicator) bearish at 16.8/55.1.\n\nThe Open Insider Buy/Sell Ratio remains neutral at 61.2.\n\nValuation\n\nValuation seems appealing given the sizable lift in forward 12-month earnings estimates for the S&P 500 to $175.24 from $170.55 per share this morning, via Bloomberg. This leaves the forward P/E multiple at 16.8x while the \"rule of twenty\" finds fair value at 18.4x.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield stands at 1.64%.\n\nThe earnings yield is 5.96%.\n\nOur Outlook\n\nWhile valuation appears to have improved and some oversold conditions have been generated, the charts and poor market breadth suggest we maintain our near-term \"neutral/negative\" outlook for the major equity indices.", "description": "All the major indices are in short-term downtrends as breadth continues to deteriorate.", "authors": ["Guy Ortmann", "Charts Weaken Further While Estimates Strengthen", "All The Major Indices Are In Short-Term Downtrends.", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Cramer", "Bruce Kamich", "Bob Lang", "Paul Price", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/72166c9f-9cfa-11e9-805e-05231447acdf.jpg"}
