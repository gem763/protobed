Epstein\u2019s brother hired Baden to observe the autopsy conducted by New York City medical examiner Barbara Sampson, who concluded that Epstein died by suicide.\n\n\u201cI think that the evidence points to homicide rather than suicide,\u201d Baden said, adding that he had \u201cnot seen in 50 years\u201d a suicide case that included injuries like Epstein\u2019s.\n\nFractures in Epstein\u2019s neck were \u201cextremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation,\u201d Baden said. Hemorrhages found around Epstein\u2019s eyes also were more common in homicidal strangulation, he said.\n\nStill, Baden said he couldn\u2019t disprove the official cause of death.\n\nEpstein, 66, was found unresponsive in his federal prison cell Aug. 10 and rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He had been awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges stemming from accusations made by dozens of women.\n\nWith a penchant for the spotlight, the 85-year-old Baden has been involved in a number of high-profile cases, including O.J. Simpson\u2019s.\n\nEpstein\u2019s neck injuries have been the subject of heavy scrutiny, and forensic experts say that such breaks can occur in people who hang themselves, particularly if they are older, The Washington Post reported shortly after Epstein\u2019s death.\n\nBaden said Epstein\u2019s brother wants authorities to release DNA evidence collected from under Epstein\u2019s fingernails and from the ligatures used.\n\nThe multimillionaire\u2019s sudden death prompted multiple investigations, which found that prison officials\u2019 procedural failures were largely to blame. Cameras near Epstein\u2019s cell were not functioning properly at the time of his death, and officers neglected to check on him as frequently as required.\n\nAfter serving an extremely lenient sentence for soliciting sex from a minor a decade ago, Epstein was arrested in July for similar offenses that allegedly took place at his properties in New York, New Mexico, Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands.", "description": "Dr. Michael Baden, a forensic expert hired by Epstein's brother, cast doubt on the official ruling that the former money manager died by suicide.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db9ae9f210000bf3634b7b1.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
