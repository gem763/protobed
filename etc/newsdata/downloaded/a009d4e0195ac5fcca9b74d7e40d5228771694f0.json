The judge said the evidence in the case, involving lobbying for Turkish interests, was insufficient to sustain a pair of guilty verdicts a jury returned in July.\n\nAs prosecutors mull whether to proceed against Giuliani, who has thus far not been charged with any crime, those well-publicized setbacks could prompt reluctance to press forward with a FARA-focused case without overwhelming evidence of guilt.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the outcomes in the Greg Craig and Rafiekian cases, the department might engage in additional pressure testing of the evidence in support of a potential FARA charge to maximize the likelihood of a conviction,\u201d said David Laufman, a former federal prosecutor who stepped down last year as head of the Justice Department section responsible for FARA enforcement.\n\nThe public defense Giuliani has offered is uncannily similar to those offered by Craig and Rafiekian. Both of those men acknowledged receiving large sums from abroad, but disputed the Justice Department\u2019s claims about whom the men were representing.\n\nWhile Craig and his law firm collected more than $5 million from an oligarch supporting Ukraine\u2019s government, the veteran D.C. lawyer maintained that his interactions with several journalists \u2014 exchanges central to the case against him \u2014 were not in service of his Ukrainian clients but to protect his own reputation and that of his law firm at the time, Skadden Arps.\n\nIn Rafiekian\u2019s case, prosecutors alleged that the lobbying and PR activities he and Flynn undertook were part of a Turkish government campaign to get the U.S. to expel a dissident Turkish cleric who has lived in self-imposed exile in the U.S. for decades. Rafiekian\u2019s lawyers claimed their client was simply working for an ordinary business, a Dutch company with interest in improving the investment climate between the U.S. and Turkey.\n\nGiuliani is taking a similar tack. He\u2019s owned up to contacts with U.S. officials about ousting the American ambassador to Ukraine and acknowledged campaigning to pressure Ukrainian officials to re-open investigations that could be damaging to Joe Biden, the former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nHowever, Giuliani maintains those entreaties were not made at the behest of his paying clients with Ukrainian ties, including the two men who were indicted and arrested earlier this month on campaign finance charges, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.\n\nThe former New York mayor says that his lobbying about the U.S. ambassador and to prod Ukraine\u2019s government to focus on Biden was for another, far more famous client he was representing, albeit without pay: President Donald Trump.\n\nGiuliani has been viewed as in jeopardy on FARA because of language in the Parnas and Furman indictment that says the charged men were acting to \u201cadvance\u2026the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working.\u201d The indictment also specifically alleges that \u201cParnas\u2019s efforts to remove the Ambassador were conducted, at least in part, at the request of one or more Ukrainian officials.\u201d\n\nProsecutors say Parnas and Fruman committed to raise at least $20,000 last year for \u201ca sitting congressman\u201d \u2014 apparently Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) \u2014 as they sought to enlist the lawmaker in efforts to oust the ambassador, career diplomat Marie Yovanovitch. Sessions wrote to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, urging her dismissal. She was recalled early from her post in May of this year.\n\nLaufman said wording in the indictment about plotting to remove the ambassador on behalf of Ukrainian officials seems to go to the heart of FARA. \u201cThat sentence to me, on its face, indicates that comes within the scope of the statute,\u201d he said. \u201cThat language in the indictment raises serious questions if Giuliani knew of this alleged conduct by these two characters.\u201d\n\nStill, while the indictment alleges a variety of campaign finance laws were broken, including using straw donors and violating the ban on donations from foreigners, there is no FARA charge against any of the defendants, let alone Giuliani.\n\nThat could be because a criminal FARA charge requires showing a defendant broke the law \u201cwillfully,\u201d meaning he or she knew about the statute \u2014 at least in general terms \u2014 and intentionally sought to defy it. A good-faith belief that one was not required to register is a defense.\n\n\u201cThe government must provide sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant knew about the requirement to register and failed to do so,\u201d Laufman said.\n\nThat can be a heavy burden in the absence of clear documentary proof that a defendant chose to break the law. There\u2019s also the question of whether prosecutors can prove whether someone was acting at the \u201cdirection or control\u201d for a foreign national, government or political party.\n\n\u201cYou can home in on a number of different definitional aspects in a FARA case and say, \u2018I didn\u2019t need to file,\u2019\u201d said D.C. lawyer Robert Driscoll. \u201cTo prove the violation is willful is really hard to do because half the attorneys in town can\u2019t give you decent FARA advice\u2026.You\u2019d have to be really dumb to show enough criminal intent to willfully violate FARA.\u201d\n\nUnder Justice Department policy, prosecutors typically have to be convinced that it is more likely than not that a defendant will be convicted on a particular charge before filing it as part of a criminal case.\n\nAnother complexity is that while many Trump critics seem to be itching for a Giuliani indictment, charging him with a FARA violation could undercut the notion that he was working for Trump in any dealings related to Ukraine. The plausibility of that argument makes it harder to prosecute Giuiliani criminally, but could make it easier to use Giuliani\u2019s acts against Trump in the ongoing impeachment probe.\n\nGiuliani did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this article.\n\nThe indictments against Craig and Rafiekian were widely seen as part of a crackdown on unregistered foreign agents in the U.S., driven in part by the controversy over Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race and in part by perceptions that the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to enforce FARA had been too meek.\n\nA Justice Department Inspector General report released jn 2016 found only seven criminal FARA cases brought by federal prosecutors during the preceding half century. Only one of those cases resulted in a contested trial. Four of the cases led to in guilty pleas, although not always to FARA. Two cases were dismissed.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s official response to the watchdog report called criminal FARA cases \u201cchallenging\u201d and cited the \u201chigh burden\u201d prosecutors have to meet to get a conviction.\n\nThe lax enforcement in recent decades gave many Americans who deal with lobbying and PR work in the U.S. for overseas clients the impression that compliance was essentially on an honor system. It also led to calls from Congress to toughen the statute, although the legislative effort seems to have stalled.\n\nTechnically, neither Craig nor Rafiekian was charged directly with failing to register under FARA.\n\nAlthough the indictment against Craig accused him of illegally evading registration, he was charged only with making false statements in a FARA submission and with a scheme to mislead Justice\u2019s FARA unit. A judge threw out the first charge, while a jury acquitted him on the second.\n\nRafiekian was accused of conspiring to make false statements in a FARA filing and of violating a related law barring actions for a foreign government in the U.S. without notifying the attorney general. A jury convicted him on both counts, but a judge overturned those verdicts and dismissed the case. On Wednesday, prosecutors filed a notice appealing that ruling, but it does not appear the Justice Department has yet made a final decision about whether to challenge the decision.\n\nTo be sure, the government has filed other criminal FARA cases in recent years, most notably the prosecution of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and deputy Rick Gates for their Ukraine-related work. However, the government was never required to prove the FARA charges in court because the men pleaded guilty.\n\nThe cases also involved allegations of a vast scheme of criminal activity, including massive tax evasion, money laundering and failing to report foreign bank accounts. Manafort and Gates appear have been willing to admit to the FARA offenses in order to try to resolve the much wide-ranging charges against them.\n\nProsecutors included FARA charges in a case filed this week against California businessman Imad Zuberi, but the charges also included allegations of tax evasion and that he made more than 75 campaign donations on behalf of foreign nationals and often under false names. Prosecutors also appear unlikely to have to prove the FARA charges, as Zuberi has agreed to plead guilty as part of a plea deal.\n\nBut several other potential FARA cases have been turned down in recent months, particularly by federal prosecutors in the same Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office which obtained the indictment of Giuliani\u2019s allies and is reportedly looking into his conduct.\n\nCraig\u2019s defense attorneys say that before he was charged, federal prosecutors in New York were considering a failing-to-register FARA charge against him. Plans for that were apparently dropped and authority over the case was moved to Washington.\n\nDuring Craig\u2019s trial in D.C., prosecutors from the Southern District sat in on some of the testimony as they considered whether to charge anyone else in connection with a FARA violation or other offenses in the effort to burnish Ukraine\u2019s image in the U.S.\n\nDespite testimony from Gates that he told top lobbyists Vin Weber and Tony Podesta they would be working for the Ukrainian government, soon after the trial wrapped up, prosecutors informed the men they would not face charges despite the fact that they did not register until long after the lobbying project concluded. The firm Weber worked for until August, Mercury, also escaped prosecution. Podesta\u2019s eponymous Podesta Group shut down in 2017, largely due to negative attention from the Manafort-linked work.\n\nWeber, Podesta and the firms all denied wrongdoing.\n\nParnas and Fruman pleaded not guilty Wednesday during a court hearing in New York. Many lawyers say they could seek leniency by detailing what Giuliani knew about their backers\u2019 abroad. \u201cIf they choose to cooperate, they could have inculpatory information as to Mr. Giuliani with respect to FARA,\u201d Laufman said.\n\nThe former Justice Department official noted that even if prosecutors choose not to charge Giuliani with a crime, the law enforcement agency has other options: it could send the former mayor a letter urging him to register and could even file suit against him to demand that he do so. Last year, in the first such enforcement action in 28 years, Justice sued a Florida company that contracts to rebroadcast programs by Russia\u2019s English-language media outlet, RT. A judge ordered the company to register under FARA.\n\nIn March, the Justice Department announced another step in its drive to reinvigorate FARA: naming Brandon Van Grack, a prosecutor from former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe, to oversee enforcement of the foreign-agent law.\n\nAt a legal conference last month, Van Grack was asked whether prosecutors\u2019 stumbles in the Craig and Rafiekian cases would impact how the Justice Department would handle FARA cases in the future.\n\nVan Grack suggested that, despite the setbacks in those prosecutions, they had sent the message that the Justice Department is serious about enforcing FARA.\n\n\u201cFARA enforcement remains a top priority,\u201d he declared. He went on to ask the assembled FARA lawyers \u201cwhether the advice you would give a registrant today is any different than it was the day before?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suspect the answer is no,\u201d he added.\n\nTheodoric Meyer contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a9/04/c120374c42dcbbe975472df884db/191024-giuliani-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
