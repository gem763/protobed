Last month, it announced a $1.6 billion investment in a joint venture to develop self-driving vehicle technologies with Aptiv <APTV.N>.\n\nHyundai Motor's third-quarter net profit rose 59% to 427 billion won ($364.75 million), compared with the average 684 billion profit estimate of analysts based on I/B/E/S Refinitiv data. That also compared with 269 billion won booked in the same period a year earlier when its profit took a dive because of costs related to engine and airbag quality issues.\n\nHyundai Motor said earlier that it has earmarked another 600 billion won to settle some of the U.S. engine-related lawsuits, install software to detect potential engine failures and offer lifetime warranties for faulty engines.\n\nIts total retail sales fell 3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, with the U.S. sales recovery offset by drops in China and South Korean sales.\n\nA favorable South Korean currency and more sales of sport utility vehicles helped support U.S. sales, while China sales remained dismal after Hyundai closed one of its factories in Beijing.\n\nHyundai heir Euisun Chung faces challenges in shoring up investor confidence as he prepares a new proposal to revamp the ownership structure of parent Hyundai Motor Group, of which the car maker is the flagship, as part of a succession plan.\n\nThe group's previous proposal was scrapped last year following opposition from U.S. hedge fund Elliott.\n\nHyundai shares rose 0.4% after the earnings announcement, versus the flat wider market <.KS11>. The shares are up about 2.5% in 2019 after slumping 24% last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)", "description": "Hyundai Motor's  quarterly net profit widely missed analyst estimates, after the South Korean automaker booked  additional charges to address potential engine defects in the United States and its home market.
