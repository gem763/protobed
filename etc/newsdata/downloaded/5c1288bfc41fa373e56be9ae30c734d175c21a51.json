Stand With Hong Kong.\" The post has since been removed and team owner Tilman Fertitta went on Twitter to distance the team from the statement.\n\n\"Daryl Morey does not speak for the Houston Rockets,\" he said on Saturday. \"Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the NBA internationally and we are not a political organization.\"\n\nThe Rockets could not be reached for comment outside of business hours.\n\nBasketball fans in China were not appeased, with many airing criticism of the Rockets on Weibo.\n\n\"I watched the Rockets for 21 years, but I'm still a Chinese person first and foremost,\" said one user in response to the basketball association's announcement.\n\nAnother said, \"We Chinese basketball fans call on either Morey to apologize or the Rockets to fire Morey. If this doesn't happen, then we call on fans to boycott watching Rockets games.\"", "description": "Chinese basketball body halts cooperation with Houston Rockets over offending tweet", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/World_News_10_800x533_L_1420026292.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
