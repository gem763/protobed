Photo: -/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe heat and smoke aren\u2019t just coming from Saudi Arabia. On Saturday, still-unconfirmed attacks from a still-unconfirmed assailant caused spectacular fires at two of the country\u2019s most important oil installations, which are now offline.\n\nThat\u2019s what we know. What we don\u2019t know more than 24 hours later: Were the attacks carried out by drones, as initially claimed, or by missiles, as some experts now suggest? Did they come from territory controlled by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, to the south, or from Iraq or Iran to the northwest? Were the attacks carried out by the Houthis, who claimed responsibility for them, or by someone else on the Houthis\u2019 behalf \u2014 or Iran\u2019s? How badly were the Saudi facilities damaged, how quickly will they be back online, and will that add just a little to the global price of oil, or will it bring full-on panic into the markets?\n\nYes, we live in the most technologically advanced society humanity has ever known. The United States and Saudi Arabia have two of the world\u2019s three largest military budgets. Yet it was possible to inflict major damage on the Saudis\u2019 most important export with a device that researchers estimate may have cost less than a good used car. What\u2019s more, it would appear \u2014 at least so far \u2014 that either Western and Saudi intelligence agencies can\u2019t trace where the attacks originated, or can\u2019t agree internally on what the facts mean.\n\nThis brings us to the Trump Administration. President Trump quickly got on the phone to Riyadh to assure Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that he had America\u2019s support. The statement issued by the White House was careful and diplomatic, neither naming a perpetrator nor promising any particular U.S. response:\n\nThe United States strongly condemns today\u2019s attack on critical energy infrastructure. Violent actions against civilian areas and infrastructure vital to the global economy only deepen conflict and mistrust. The United States Government is monitoring the situation and remains committed to ensuring global oil markets are stable and well supplied.\n\nBut his Secretary of State struck an entirely different tone, pledging that \u201cIran will be held accountable for its aggression and tweeting:\n\nTehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy. Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\n\nThis was rather astonishing since the world leader the Iranians are \u201cpretend[ing] to engage in diplomacy\u201d with is Pompeo\u2019s boss, President Trump. As was widely noted in media coverage of Trump\u2019s firing of National Security Adviser John Bolton last week, Pompeo is also known for his more hawkish views on Iran, but has exercised considerable skill in never getting crosswise of Trump in public or private. In the memorable words of a former ambassador who spoke off the record to New Yorker writer Susan Glasser, \u201che\u2019s like a heat-seeking missile for Trump\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\nPompeo seemed to get some support from an unexpected quarter this morning when House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff said that the Houthis would have needed Iranian assistance to mount such an attack. The Democratic lawmaker also emphasized, however, that diplomacy with Iran was the only way out of the situation.\n\nSo, situation normal, the Trump administration doesn\u2019t have a coherent position on a problem with enormous security and economic consequences. But the next time someone tells you that high-technology weaponry is making us all safer, and that sensors, networks, and intelligence make everything knowable and traceable, whether that something involves high finance or nuclear weaponry, remember this moment, when neither militaries nor markets have definitive information about what happened or how to react.\n\nAnd keep an eye on Pompeo and the markets tomorrow, to see who is rising \u2014 and who is falling.", "description": "The stunning attack on the heart of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production infrastructure is a major crisis, and the Trump administration\u2019s response does not inspire confidence in its ability to handle it.", "authors": ["Heather Hurlburt"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/15/15-saudi-arabia-oil-facility-attack.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
