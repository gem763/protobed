But he suffered an undisclosed injury in practice last week and missed the Hoosiers\u2019 51-10 loss to No. 6 Ohio State.\n\nPeyton Ramsey , meanwhile, started 16 games over the previous two seasons and played well in relief of Penix in a blowout win over Eastern Illinois before putting up pedestrian numbers against the Buckeyes, in part because of the struggling rushing attack.\n\nEverybody expects to see a better overall performance this week.\n\n\u201cPeyton\u2019s got a lot of snaps under his belt in this program and he\u2019s done some great things,\u201d first-year offensive coordinator Kalen DeBoer said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get one response one way or the other (last week) when they felt and knew Mike wasn\u2019t going to play for us, and I would expect that to be the case again this week if that happens.\u201d\n\nAt least Indiana (2-1, 0-1 Big Ten) faces a less daunting task.\n\nThe Huskies (1-1) have lost 17 straight against Football Bowl Subdivision opponents since last beating Tulsa on Oct. 21, 2017, and, like the Hoosiers, were forced to change quarterbacks because of an injury.\n\nMike Beaudry won the job in camp, started UConn\u2019s season-opening win over Wagner and then suffered an undisclosed injury during the game.\n\nCoach Randy Edsall went with freshman Jack Zergiotis in a Week 2 loss to Illinois, then decided to make the change permanent. Now, after a bye week, Edsall hopes to see progress - and the end of the losing streak.\n\n\u201cI think the bye was good for us,\u201d Edsall said. \u201cWith the change we had at quarterback, it gave us another week to help Jack get better. Plus, it gave us a chance to continue to work on the fundamentals and technique, but also to get better at the things we know we can do well.\u201d\n\nBIG TROUBLE?\n\nWhile the Huskies have won the only two meetings in this series, they\u2019ve struggled against the Big Ten and in non-conference play.\n\nConnecticut has lost seven of its last 10 overall outside the American Athletic Conference and is 14-27 all-time against Big Ten foes, including the 31-23 loss to Illinois.\n\nIndiana, meanwhile, has won 16 of its last 17 in non-league play.\n\nFAST START\n\nIndiana tight end Peyton Hendershot has become a favorite target for Penix, Ramsey and Donovan Hale, the receiver who connected with Hendershot for a 49-yard TD pass last week.\n\nHendershot has taken full advantage of his opportunities, too.\n\nAfter three games, he leads the Hoosiers in receptions (13), yards receiving (191) and TD catches (two). Nationally, he\u2019s tied for fifth among tight ends in receptions, ranks fifth in yards and is eighth in TD catches - and he\u2019s already cracked Indiana\u2019s top 10 single-season yardage mark for tight ends.\n\nTOUGH COMBO\n\nGetting Zergiotis some extra practice wasn\u2019t the only thing Edsall worked on the last two weeks.\n\nHe knows the Huskies need to reduce their turnovers after committing five in the first two weeks, especially against a Hoosiers team that has forced at least one in 20 of their last 21 games.\n\nAnother problem: Conn averages 2.7 yards per carry, the 10th-lowest in the FBS. Playing Indiana could help. The Hoosiers allowed 306 yards last week and are giving up 155.3 yards per game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Indiana coach Tom Allen heads into Saturday's game with some of the same concerns he had last week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/indiana_penix_football_78061_c0-118-2814-1758_s1770x1032.jpg?726ffb50cf34401b768b2f62da2bdef97cbc891c", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
