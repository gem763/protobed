The menu will feature two premium-priced sandwiches that appear to be very differentiated relative to McDonald\u2019s McMuffin and Burger King\u2019s Croisan\u2019wich: Breakfast Baconator and the Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit.\n\nWendy\u2019s will also lay the groundwork to a possible coffee platform rollout, starting with an iced drink coined the Frosty-ccino (Wendy\u2019s Frosty and coffee).\n\n\"Launching breakfast in our U.S. restaurants nationwide provides incredible growth opportunities,\" said Todd Penegor, president and CEO of Wendy's in a statement. \"We are well-positioned to pursue it. We believe we have the right team and structure in place, and we put Wendy's fan favorites on our breakfast menu to set us apart from the competition.\"\n\nWendy\u2019s has more than 5,900 restaurants in the U.S., so this is no small product rollout. It will require not only the hiring of new workers, but likely new equipment and the training of existing employees. Wendy\u2019s only sells breakfast in some 300 of its locations and the menu is limited to a few simple sandwiches.\n\nFILE- This March 17, 2014, file photo shows a Wendy's logo outside a Wendy's restaurant in Pittsburgh.

Wendy\u2019s sees 2019 earnings per share declining 3.5% to 6.5% \u2014 previously it expected 3.5% to 7% growth.\n\nWendy's stock fell 3.6% in after-hours trading on the guidance cut.\n\nBreakfast not a new thing\n\nWendy\u2019s is no stranger to the broader breakfast game. The company made unsuccessful forays into breakfast in 1985 and 2007. Both times, the mighty McMuffin won out.\n\nBut the decision makes so much sense today that it\u2019s almost silly to explain why. For starters, breakfast continues to be one of the strongest times of the day for fast-food chains. That\u2019s a prime reason why a Dunkin\u2019 Brands has recently launched egg white bowls and new iced coffee lines. Starbucks has vastly improved its breakfast food, hoping to capture more sales from morning coffee drinkers. Even McDonald\u2019s has sought to improve the ingredient quality for the McMuffin.\n\nMeanwhile, the ability to order food via mobile devices and have it delivered should instantly put Wendy\u2019s in the breakfast conversation. Wendy\u2019s not being in breakfast is almost unacceptable in the age of digital.\n\nNext headline for Wendy\u2019s: A shiny new share repurchase program, which could come at the company\u2019s October 11 investor day.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
