Plants in the wetland, and the process of burning down trees in order to make more room for waterways, pumped greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the University of Texas researchers said\n\nResearchers from the University of Texas have suggested their theory based on aerial scans and imaging of the legacy Mayan farmland left underground.\n\nThey discovered that a wetland known as the Birds of Paradise wetland, in northwestern Belize, was five times as big as had been believed.\n\nAnd they also found another similar complex which was even larger.\n\nThe wetlands had irrigation ditches and canals built into them and sometimes forest was destroyed to make way for them.\n\nThese processes were made more extreme as the Mayans tried to adapt to a changing climate \u2013 mainly rising sea levels \u2013 about 1,800 years ago.\n\nAlthough they were useful in controlling water and preserving it to use during droughts, passages in the wetlands contained plants which produced high levels of methane, a greenhouse gas.\n\nAnd the farmers also pumped carbon dioxide into the air by burning vegetation to clear space for their canals.\n\nWHO WERE THE MAYANS? The Maya civilisation thrived in Central America for nearly 3,000 years, reaching its height between AD 250 to 900. Noted for the only fully developed written language of the pre-Columbian Americas, the Mayas also had highly advanced art and architecture as well as mathematical and astronomical systems. During that time, the ancient people built incredible cities using advanced machinery and gained an understanding of astronomy, as well as developing advanced agricultural methods and accurate calendars. The Maya believed the cosmos shaped their everyday lives and they used astrological cycles to tell when to plant crops and set their calendars. This has led to theories that the Maya may have chosen to locate their cities in line with the stars. It is already known that the pyramid at Chichen Itza was built according to the sun\u2019s location during the spring and autumn equinoxes. When the sun sets on these two days, the pyramid casts a shadow on itself that aligns with a carving of the head of the Mayan serpent god. The shadow makes the serpent's body so that as the sun sets, the terrifying god appears to slide towards the earth. Maya influence can be detected from Honduras, Guatemala, and western El Salvador to as far away as central Mexico, more than 1,000km from the Maya area. The Maya peoples never disappeared. Today their descendants form sizable populations throughout the Maya area. They maintain a distinctive set of traditions and beliefs that are the result of the merger of pre-Columbian and post-Conquest ideas and cultures.\n\nThe latest discoveries suggest the Mayans, between 1,800 and 1,000 years ago, had a bigger impact on their environment than previously thought.
