I no longer feel the need to hide my face.\n\n(Image: Facebook/The Natalia Project)\n\n\"There is no way I can pay everyone back for how they have helped.\"\n\nSurgeons in Australia became aware of her plight after she was found by a member of a US medical team in February 2018.\n\nThe American contacted Peter Gray, then-president of the Rotary Club of Phnom Penh, and asked for help.\n\nMr Gray said in an interview with the Liverpool City Champion newspaper last year: \"No-one deserves to live like this.\"\n\n(Image: Facebook/The Natalia Project)\n\nRotary clubs in Cambodia and Australia raised more than \u00a314,000 to fly Ms Apaseray to Sydney for multiple surgeries and cover local transport and accommodation.\n\nThe hospital treated her as a humanitarian patient and the medical team donated their time.\n\nAfter her first surgery in May, she underwent major facial reconstruction during a seven-hour operation in June.\n\nDoctors removed a large portion of the right side of her face and rebuilt her nose, mouth and eyelid.\n\nDr Kernohan said hailed Ms Apaseray's courage, adding: \"Natalia has been so brave throughout this unfamiliar journey and has not complained once.\"\n\nRotary members took her sightseeing in a bid to keep her spirits up as she recovered from the operations.", "description": "Natalia Apaseray, who was born with rare neurofibromatosis, was tormented by local children who would throw rocks at her", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Facebook The Natalia Project", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20657162.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_xxxxxxxxxx2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
