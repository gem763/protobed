It\u2019s Everest", "language": "en", "text": "According to a recent report, PM Narendra Modi\u2019s Swachh Bharat campaign is not only going transnational but is also scaling new heights of endeavour. In a concerted six-week clean-up drive, a 14-member team put together by the Nepali government working in tandem with environment groups, retrieved some 10 tons of garbage \u2013 including plastic water bottles, tin cans, and discarded climbing equipment \u2013 from altitudes as high as 26,000-plus feet on Mount Everest, the world\u2019s highest peak.\n\nDecades of near-unregulated climbing by mountaineers \u2013 which included a contingent of the People\u2019s Liberation Army of China, which years ago claimed to have scaled the peak sans the use of oxygen and singing inspirational Mao songs \u2013 had turned the mightiest of Himalayas, named after British surveyor George Everest, into the \u2018world\u2019s highest junkyard\u2019 which might more aptly be called Mount Neverest.\n\nRidding Everest of its accumulated rubbish is making not only environmental but also economic good sense. The high-altitude trash is being turned by local entrepreneurs into a variety of designer goods, ranging from drinking glasses, to utensils, to light fixtures, which are being snapped up by five-star hotels and fashionable boutiques which can legitimately claim to be high-end. But perhaps the best reason to justify the retrieval of Everest\u2019s junk would be contained in a repeat of Mallory\u2019s famous response as to why he wanted to climb the mountain: \u201cBecause it is there.\u201d", "description": "According to a recent report, PM Narendra Modi\u2019s Swachh Bharat campaign is not only going transnational but is also scaling new heights of endeavour.\u00a0 In a concerted six-week clean-up drive, a 14-member team put together...", "authors": ["Jug Suraiya"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/jug.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
