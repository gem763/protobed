Luckman had been accused of participating in a particularly grisly crime\u2014the beating death of his wife\u2019s brother, apparently for embezzling from the family company. Sitting in the courtroom that day, just behind Luckman, was his son Sid, a student celebrated on the sports pages in New York for his feats as a high-school tailback.\n\nThe New York Times wrote that Sid Luckman, together with his mother and siblings, retained his composure as the verdict was read. The young athlete would go on to shine at Columbia University and help revolutionize professional football as the star quarterback of the Chicago Bears. But, as R.D. Rosen writes in \u201cTough Luck: Sid Luckman, Murder, Inc., and the Rise of the Modern NFL,\u201d \u201cnot once, from the late 1930s on, did any reporter, in the sports or any other department, refer to Sid Luckman as the son of a convicted murderer.\u201d\n\nOne of the pleasures of this biography is its salting with quaint details of American life from not so long ago. Of course, most of these focus on football: the days before stadium phones, when a coach high in the stands would wrap a note around a rock and heave it down to his team; the Bears\u2019 offensive end Dick Plasman, still playing, in the early 1940s, without a helmet; some 15,000 fans attending a high-school football game in Ebbets Field, outdrawing the pro teams that played there that same month.\n\nPhoto: WSJ\n\nTough Luck By R.D.

It\u2019s enough to give a modern-day journalist pause: Have we lost something or made progress? We\u2019ve certainly missed the chance to explore how growing up with a man capable of such violence influenced the young athlete. The author does his best to glean what can be learned, but records and recollections offer little. The father enjoyed football and took great pride in his son, even sitting with the team on the sideline as the younger Luckman\u2019s running, passing and punting for Erasmus Hall High School shredded his opponents.\n\nBut by the time Sid led Columbia to its improbable victory over Army and made the cover of the Oct. 24, 1938, issue of Life magazine, the elder Luckman was already up the Hudson River at Sing Sing prison. The younger Luckman didn\u2019t talk about the conviction, and in a 1949 autobiography he sanitized the brief mentions of his father. Sid Luckman\u2019s own son knew little about his criminal grandfather until he learned about him from Mr. Rosen.\n\nThe family, originally Jewish immigrants from Lithuania, had settled in Brooklyn\u2019s Flatbush neighborhood. The book glancingly refers to the anti-Semitism that Sid Luckman faced in his athletic career\u2014he was one of the few Jewish players in the NFL\u2014but in general the role of religion in his life rarely comes up. Yiddish, though, provides one of the book\u2019s sweetest anecdotes. Luckman\u2019s mother, Ethel, had always abhorred football for its brutality and refused to watch her son\u2019s games. On Sid Luckman Day at New York\u2019s Polo Grounds in 1943, however, when the Bears played the Giants, Luckman finally convinced his mother to attend. The Bears ran away with the game, silencing the Giants fans, but once, when Luckman dropped back to pass, his protection broke down and several massive Giants linemen chased after him. His mom\u2019s shouts carried over the quiet stands: \u201cSideleh! Sideleh! Gebn zey di pilke, Sideleh! Give them the ball, Sidney! You\u2019re going to get hurt!\u201d\n\nMr. Rosen invests considerable effort to link Luckman\u2019s father to one of the most infamous Jewish gangsters of the era, Louis \u201cLepke\u201d Buchalter, said to be the author of 70 murders and the one-time head of the kill-for-hire operation known as Murder, Inc. Soft-spoken and unassuming, Buchalter applied his ruthless skills to build a labor-racketeering empire and, by Mr. Rosen\u2019s account, had an ally in Meyer Luckman. Buchalter and the elder Luckman apparently weren\u2019t close associates, however, and Mr. Rosen acknowledges that Luckman was no more than a \u201creliable cog\u201d in Buchalter\u2019s \u201cfinely tuned machine.\u201d\n\nThe murder that sent Luckman away grew out of an entirely different matter. As Mr. Rosen puts it, \u201cstealing from one\u2019s own was a capital offense\u201d in Luckman\u2019s world. Ethel Luckman never spoke to her husband again after his conviction. When he died of heart failure at Sing Sing in 1944, the story made the New York newspapers, but none made any mention of the famous football player who survived him.\n\nMr. Rosen suggests that the younger Luckman may have found a father-substitute in the Bears\u2019 owner and coach, George Halas, known admiringly in Chicago as \u201cPapa Bear.\u201d Halas spotted the young man\u2019s talent when Luckman was playing for Columbia, and together they pioneered the T-formation and the forward pass, turning football toward the game we know today. The Bears dominated the NFL in the 1940s\u2014appearing in five championship games and winning four. The coach and his star would go on to develop a close lifelong bond.\n\nAfter Luckman\u2019s football career ended following the 1950 season\u2014he is considered by far the best quarterback the Bears have ever fielded\u2014he went on to successes as a salesman, business executive and investor. He also practiced astonishing generosity, continually lavishing money, gifts and favors on everyone from friends to random acquaintances. Compensation for his father\u2019s sins? \u201cVirtuous acts became second nature to Sid,\u201d Mr. Rosen writes, \u201cevery bighearted gesture perhaps expunging a little more of his family\u2019s shame.\u201d\n\nGiven the link to organized crime that touched his family, Luckman was oddly casual over the years about befriending questionable figures in Chicago, which featured its own rich portfolio of mobsters. But the man who could erase his father\u2019s terrible crime apparently assumed that the stains of others would never tarnish him. And, indeed, they didn\u2019t. Widely admired in Chicago, he lived a long and seemingly happy life, dying in 1998 at the age of 81. His gravestone in Skokie, Ill., reads, \u201cI had it all. I did it all. I loved it all.\u201d\n\nMr. Babcock, the former editor of Chicago magazine, teaches journalism at Northwestern University.", "description": "Sid Luckman\u2019s feats on the gridiron have been reported in detail.
