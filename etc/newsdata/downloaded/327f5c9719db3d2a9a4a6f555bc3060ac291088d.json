Charles had eight rebounds and closed the season with 156 career double-doubles, one behind Lisa Leslie, who is second on the WNBA all-time list.\n\nBrittney Sykes had 12 points for the Dream and Jessica Breland had 10 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nAtlanta gave a ceremonial start to injured forward Angel McCoughtry, who has been sidelined for the season while recovering from a knee injury she suffered last year. They took her out right after the tip.\n\nA loss in their last game assured the Liberty of having the best odds in the WNBA draft lottery and then they get to end their season with a win to avoid finishing last. The lottery is weighted on a rolling two-year record.\n\nWith 16 assists, New York broke its franchise record with 663, one more than last season.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tina Charles scored 14 points, Amanda Zahui B added a double-double and the New York Liberty topped the Atlanta Dream 71-63 in a battle between the bottom two teams on Sunday, the last day of the WNBA season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
