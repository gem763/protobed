And that's good news for the business that Intel expects to propel the chip behemoth to a new era of growth.\n\nIntel shares climbed 3% in late trades after the chip giant reported stronger-than-expected results, powered by solid gains in its data center business. The Santa Clara, California-based semiconductor maker also boosted its quarterly and full-year outlook.\n\n\"We feel great about the quarter,\" Intel CEO Bob Swan told analysts on an earnings call. \"The market we see, the trends we see are as big as we've ever seen.\"\n\nOn the other hand, its PC chips division, which was once Intel's core business, posted a 5% dip in sales to $9.7 billion.\n\nIntel has struggled with production issues that led to the company underestimating demand, with the consequence that PC manufacturers have recently found themselves without enough chips to meet demand for their hardware. Swan said those production challenges will likely linger in the fourth quarter, but will hopefully be resolved by next year.\n\n\"We're letting our customers down and they're expecting more from us,\" he said. \"Our intention next year is not be a constraint on our customer's growth.\"\n\nThings are looking good in the data center\n\nThe trends are particularly upbeat in the data center market. Revenue for Intel's data center business rose 4% year-over-year to $6.4 billion.\n\nIntel makes processors that power data centers and cloud platforms. Intel and other chipmakers saw strong demand for these products the previous year boosting expectations of continued strong growth.\n\nWith a shrinking PC market, Intel has pivoted to focus on chips for the expanding cloud market, where major providers \u2014 like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google \u2014 are looking to expand capacity by building more and bigger data centers.\n\nBut the data center and cloud buildout recently stalled, leading to a sudden slowdown in chip demand.\n\n\"Our experience with the cloud providers is they go through big buying cycles and relatively long digestion periods,\" Intel CEO Bob Swan told analysts.\n\nHe said that \"digestion period\" appeared to be ending in the third period when \"we started to see them come back into the market to begin to purchase a bit more.\"\n\nWhile the data center soars, the PC business stagnates\n\nAnalyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said Intel's data center business growth was the most impressive part of the report.\n\n\"I believe the biggest breakthrough was the data center group for growth in the second half of the year, which had been promised and many dismissed,\" he told Business Insider, citing some skepticism about Intel's projections. Enterprise growth, he added, is \"a very good sign.\"\n\nStill, Intel's shrinking PC business was a notable weakness in the view of analyst Marty Wolf, president of Martinwolf M&A Advisors.\n\nIntel \"can't build enough to meet demand,\" he told Business Insider. \"Not a good place to be for a world class manufacturer. Since there really were no surprises in forecasts, it's inexplicable. When they block and tackle better, the shareholders will be rewarded.\"\n\nBy the numbers\n\nIntel reported a third-quarter profit of $5.99 billion, or $1.35 a share, compared to a profit of $6.4 billion, or $1.38 a share for the year-earlier period.\n\nRevenue edged higher to $9.19 billion from $19.16 billion in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted income was $1.42 a share.\n\nAnalysts expected a profit of $1.24 a share on revenue of $18.05 billion.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Intel said it expects adjusted profit of $1.24 a share on revenue of $19.2 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.21 a share on revenue of $18.82 billion.\n\nIntel raised its full-year revenue forecast by $1.5 billion to $71 billion. The chip giant said it now expects adjusted profit of $4.60 for the current year.\n\nAnalysts were expecting a profit of $4.39 a share, on revenue of $69.43 billion.\n\nGot a tip about Intel or another tech company?
