That's following six years of coverage gains that brought the uninsured rate to its lowest level in history.\n\nBut while this erosion is harmful, a full-scale ACA repeal, which the administration is continuing to pursue through the courts, would make matters far, far worse.\n\nTrump's policies undermine the ACA\n\nTrump policies that have undermined coverage include a repeal of the ACA's individual mandate, the requirement that people have coverage or pay a penalty. And while a repeal did not take effect until 2019, experts have concluded it reduced coverage significantly starting in 2018 because of consumer confusion.\n\nThe administration has also cut federal outreach and advertising for the ACA marketplaces by 90% and is supporting harsh new state policies that make it harder for people to enroll or stay enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nIn addition, the administration's harsh anti-immigrant stance \u2014 including changing how Medicaid eligibility affects decisions concerning who can legally enter the US and which immigrants here legally can adjust to lawful permanent resident status \u2014 have sown widespread fear and confusion in immigrant communities, likely increasing uninsured rates in families that include immigrant members.\n\nThe new census data offers suggestive evidence that this climate of fear is taking a toll on health coverage. The uninsured rate among Latinos rose 1.6 percentage points, more than for other racial or ethnic groups, and the uninsured rate among Latino children rose 1 percentage point. Also suggestive, coverage losses were especially large among foreign-born residents, both noncitizens and citizens.\n\nLooking beyond 2018, coverage losses from administration policies will most likely keep growing. For the first time this year, the census report includes some preliminary data on uninsured rates for the current year. These data shows a further rise in the uninsured rate between March 2018 and March 2019.\n\nThe real danger is a full ACA repeal\n\nEven with coverage trends moving in the wrong direction, however, the \"Census American Community Survey\" shows that the uninsured rate remains 40% below its 2010 level, which means that 21 million more people have health coverage. The Centers for Disease Control's \"National Health Interview Survey\" shows that despite this year's reversal, the uninsured rate remains lower than in any other year from 1963 through 2014.\n\nThat's because the ACA's major coverage provisions are continuing to cover millions of people who would otherwise be uninsured. Consistent with that, the \"National Health Interview Survey\" data also shows that the share of Americans who went without care because of cost in 2018 was down 30% relative to its 2010 peak.\n\nBut with 18 Republican state attorneys general, the administration is continuing to seek the ACA's full repeal through the courts. And while it claims to have a replacement for the ACA in mind, the administration's budget proposals endorse a \"repeal and replace\" plan that would still eliminate the ACA's expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults, the ACA marketplaces, and nationwide protections for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nBased on Urban Institute projections, we estimate that if courts struck down the ACA this year, the uninsured rate would rise above pre-ACA levels to 18.7%, with nearly 20 million more people becoming uninsured.\n\nKeep your eye on the courts, because the harm from a full-scale ACA repeal would dwarf the coverage erosion of 2018 that we see in the latest data.\n\nAviva Aron-Dine is the vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
