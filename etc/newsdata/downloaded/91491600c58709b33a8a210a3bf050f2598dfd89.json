Japan Companies Are Sitting on Record $4.8 Trillion in Cash\n\n(Bloomberg) -- In banks across Japan sits a pile of money that\u2019s bigger than most countries\u2019 gross domestic product -- the cash reserves of the nation\u2019s companies. For some it\u2019s a testament to their strength, but to many it\u2019s a wasted opportunity.\n\nFirms listed in Japan held 506.4 trillion yen ($4.8 trillion) in cash as of their latest filings, the highest level on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It\u2019s more than tripled since March 2013, months after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe returned to power vowing to stamp out cash-hoarding.\n\nWhile companies see the money as a buffer against hard times, it has long riled investors, who say executives should invest it for growth or return it to shareholders. In one of his most lauded policies, Abe has overhauled corporate governance structures, seeking to make firms use capital more productively rather than letting it fester in bank accounts.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the prime minister\u2019s efforts haven\u2019t borne fruit. Companies are providing larger returns to shareholders since Abe\u2019s government instituted new rules for investors and executives starting in 2014. But Zuhair Khan, head of research at Jefferies Japan Ltd., estimates they\u2019re only distributing about 40% of profits to stock owners when they could afford to pay out about 70%.\n\n\u201cThis Scrooge-like situation needs to be fixed,\u201c said Naoki Kamiyama, chief strategist at Nikko Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.\n\nThe traditional narrative of overly cautious chief executive officers clinging to unnecessarily large amounts of cash no longer tells the whole story, according to Felix Lam, a senior Asia Pacific equities portfolio manager at BNP Paribas (PA: ) SA in Hong Kong. Now, rising cash levels are more a function of increasing profits. Earnings per share at companies in the benchmark index in the second quarter of this year were up 80% compared to the three months ended December 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\u201cThe reason for high cash levels has shifted from being conservative to becoming a result of improving fundamentals,\u201d Lam said by email. \u201cIn the last three financial years, Japanese companies\u2019 buybacks have reached record high levels and they are mostly financed through their own balance sheet rather than debt.\u201d\n\nAnnounced repurchases by Japan-listed firms rose to about $60 billion in 2018, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ). estimates. In the first five months of this year, they\u2019ve already reached about $50 billion, as companies such as Sony Corp (T: ). and SoftBank Group Corp. announced plans for record buybacks.\n\nAt the same time, companies have paid out 8.4 trillion yen in dividends so far in 2019, an all-time high, according to Societe Generale (PA: ) SA.\n\nBut the repurchases still pale in comparison to the U.S. market, where the 500 largest companies announced $800 billion in buybacks last year, according to Societe Generale (PA: ).\n\nThe rose 0.2% in early trading Tuesday, bringing its gain for this year to just under 1%. The S&P 500 Index is up almost 17% in 2019.\n\nCritics say Japanese businesses aren\u2019t doing enough with their money. Mergers and acquisitions, for example, have been muted. Total deals announced by Japan-listed firms this year slumped to about $95 billion from about $215 billion in the same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAnd by holding big piles of cash at zero interest, companies end up with lower returns on equity, according to Soichiro Matsumoto, chief investment officer for Japan at Credit Suisse (SIX: ) Group AG.\n\nJapanese executives\u2019 penny-pinching ways are no surprise to many market watchers, who say most firms adopted a conservative attitude when asset prices collapsed in the early 1990s. The ensuing period of economic stagnation, dubbed the lost decades, saw failing financial institutions who could no longer lend to businesses.\n\nRainy Day\n\nThree decades later, company executives still want to be independent of debt financing. \u201cThe strategy is to have a lot of cash because that gives you strategic flexibility for acquisitions or a cushion for a rainy day because who knows when the economy might go bad,\u201d Khan of Jefferies said.\n\nLooking ahead, investors see the possibility of more change at Japan Inc., as an increasing number of activists target companies with poor shareholder returns. But most say the cash will keep piling up, while profits distributed to stock owners will increase only gradually.\n\n\u201cIt is nice that companies are returning more money to investors through higher buybacks,\u201d said Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA Ltd. in Tokyo. \u201cBut it\u2019s not nearly enough.\u201d\n\n(Updates to include Tuesday\u2019s trading in 11th paragraph.)", "description": "Japan Companies Are Sitting on Record $4.8 Trillion in Cash", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC37002_L.jpg"}
