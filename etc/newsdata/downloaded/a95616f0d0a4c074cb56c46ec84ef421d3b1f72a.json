Read more\n\nThose who still wish to stand have been offered legal advice about challenging the decision barring them from standing as Tory MPs, though it is understood that they have also been advised a previous high court decision could make it a difficult fight.\n\nHammond, the former chancellor, has already threatened potential legal action having been re-adopted by his association and Rory Stewart, the former international development secretary and leadership candidate, said he was also among those who still hoped to stand again for election in his constituency of Penrith.\n\nAsked if he would consider a legal challenge, Stewart said: \u201cI would consider doing the most straightforward thing of all, which is asking my constituents to support me, which they always have in the past. And I think other colleagues will do the same.\u201d\n\nEarlier, in a show of defiance, the now-independent MPs gathered in the top corner of the House of Commons chamber during prime minister\u2019s questions, but remained on the Conservative benches. Ken Clarke, who had the whip removed after 49 years, remained in his seat next to the former prime minister Theresa May.\n\n\u201cThey are Conservatives, no one can tell me Ken Clarke is not a Conservative,\u201d one Tory MP said. \u201cMost of us believe the same as them \u2013 that we want to leave the EU with a deal. This has been a total nightmare and many of us are just really upset. The usual suspects will be unfriendly and many of us do disagree with what they did but there is no unfriendliness.\u201d\n\nA number of the rebels said Nicholas Soames, the veteran Conservative MP and grandson of Winston Churchill, had said many more MPs would not be able to stand for the party if it stood on a manifesto backing no deal.\n\nHe said he had received more than 500 emails from people thanking him for the rebellion. \u201cIn a debate in the House in 1938, Chamberlain accused my grandfather of undermining his negotiations with the Germans,\u201d he told the Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus.\n\n\u201cI think history will prove my grandpapa to be right under the circumstances. And I think I will prove to be right.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:16 Sir Nicholas Soames delivers emotional speech after Tory whip withdrawn \u2013 video\n\nThe rebel group were asked late on Tuesday night if they would remove themselves from the MPs\u2019 WhatsApp group although Soames said the group was \u201cpeopled by lunatics, largely\u201d and that \u201canyone with any sense has got off it for the sake of their mental health\u201d.\n\nSoames said he still hoped colleagues who wanted to continue would be allowed eventually to stand again for the party. \u201cI hope what they will do is grow up and these people will be on the naughty step now but then allowed to stand,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI mean, the idea that Richard Benyon would not any longer be the member for Newbury is enough to make me want to leave the Tory party altogether, voluntarily.\u201d\n\nSoames said both the chief whip, Mark Spencer, and Johnson\u2019s adviser, Dominic Cummings, had been courteous when they met but that he had been particularly irked by the attitude of Jacob Rees-Mogg in the Commons\u2019 chamber.\n\n\u201cJacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s performance last night, his rudeness and casualness to colleagues, shows he just doesn\u2019t understand the way it works,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a student union speech on steroids, it was awful. It was revolting, it was just bloody bad behaviour, you wouldn\u2019t see Andrea Leadsom lying about.\u201d\n\nGuto Bebb, the former defence minister who also lost the whip on Tuesday night, also cited Rees-Mogg as a catalyst for some colleagues\u2019 decisions.\n\n\u201cThere were at least four individuals who were still doubtful who changed their position to being supportive and voting with us on the back of Jacob\u2019s performance,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was deemed to be arrogant, out of touch and I think the way in which he treated some of the interventions was a red rag to bull in many cases.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 0:31 Caroline Lucas slams Jacob Rees-Mogg's body language during debate \u2013 video\n\nThe veteran Conservative MP Roger Gale blamed the strategy pursued by Johnson on Cummings, saying it was \u201cin danger of tearing the party apart\u201d and said the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives may have to act.\n\n\u201cI think to have an unelected, foul-mouth oaf at the heart of Downing Street is dangerous and acceptable,\u201d he told ITV news. \u201cThe time has come for Mr Johnson to get a handle on this and have Mr Cummings frogmarched out of Downing Street, because if he doesn\u2019t the damage is going to continue.\n\n\u201cThe manner in which, I know because I have had from the horse\u2019s mouth, some of my colleagues who went to discuss courteously with Mr Johnson their situation yesterday were treated by Mr Cummings was quite appalling. That has to stop. If it doesn\u2019t then maybe the 1922 Committee can do something about it but we cannot go on like this.\u201d", "description": "Source says about 10 of those sacked still planned to stand again for the party", "authors": ["Jessica Elgot"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44d5483b03f05dd18e75629e540cdac2d9b64ca4/405_281_2923_1754/master/2923.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=97fe589fae0c362df5fc9539fac30659"}
