Although, Cargill told BBC News that figure was \"not accurate and significantly inflated\".\n\nIn July, Cargill told its Brazilian suppliers it would not support a temporary ban on soya grown on newly deforested land in the Cerrado - which has left environmental groups fuming.\n\n\"We remain committed to the soy moratorium in the Amazon but we believe that is not the right solution for the Cerrado,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\n\"Asking companies to exit won't solve the problem - it will simply move it. By pushing farmers to other buyers, the same practices will continue.\"\n\nIt has pledged $30m (\u00a324m) to fund new ideas for ending deforestation.\n\nA new analysis of satellite data by the Rapid Response project, seen by BBC News, suggests Cargill has been buying soya directly from farms in the region of the Cerrado responsible for forest fires. The project is a partnership between three groups, Aidenvironment, MapHubs and Mighty Earth.\n\nOn one farm, it says, 837 hectares (3.2 sq miles) of wooded savannah was cleared between April and June 2019 and fires were detected by the satellite imagery on 23 August.\n\nIt is impossible to say if crop from that specific farm was exported but trade data shows 7,103 tonnes of soya beans were shipped from the same municipality, Formosa Do Rio Preto, to the UK in 2017, the majority by Cargill.\n\nCargill accepts it does buy soya from the farm in question but says the farm met all compliance criteria and was not on the Brazilian government's embargoed list.\n\n\"As soon as we received an inquiry regarding potential non-compliance... we initiated our grievance process and an investigation is currently under way,\" a spokeswoman for the company told BBC News.\n\n\"We will take immediate action if illegal activity is found.\"\n\nRetailers' pledge\n\nEnvironmental groups have been trying to increase the pressure on western retailers.\n\nTesco, Sainsbury and M&S have all pledged to achieve zero deforestation in their supply chains by 2020, although it is accepted that target is almost certain to be missed.\n\nEnvironmental groups say the fast food sector is a particular concern - Burger King and KFC source some chicken directly from Brazil.\n\nAlong with chains such as McDonald's, Nando's, Pret a Manger and Five Guys they also sell British meat reared, at least in part, on soya shipped from the regions.\n\nThe proportion of animal feed made up of soya can vary dramatically between suppliers and farms in the UK, with some using a diet of grass and grain instead.\n\nMcDonald's says it is working to determine the level of deforestation risk in specific parts of the Cerrado and assessing whether fires are being lit at an individual farm level.\n\nOther retailers and fast-food outlets, including Waitrose and Nando's, buy financial credits designed to offset the deforestation risk.\n\nMr George said: \"This may sound persuasive but the actual soya they use may still come from farms that are destroying forests.\"\n\nBurger King has been particularly criticised after pledging to end deforestation in its supply chains by 2030, a target criticised as \"embarrassingly weak\".\n\nThe company told BBC News it had written to its meat suppliers to remind them of its policy of not accepting products raised on former rainforest land. It says its beef suppliers in the UK use soya as a minor food additive only.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \"We are aware that in some of our beef, there are trace amounts of soya in the feed. We are also aware that there is no traceability programme in place anywhere in the world that can currently track all soy beans to a single farm in a single country.\"\n\nSoya based foods like soya milk, tofu and meat replacement products are also made from soya beans, but the companies tend to be smaller in scale and more able to trace their supply chain.\n\nThe Vegan Society said: \"The use of Amazonian soya in vegan food manufacturing is fairly insignificant, given that most brands source from Europe, and up to 91% of deforestation in the rainforest comes directly from animal agriculture. Farmed animals eat far more soya than we would if we ate it directly, therefore wasting resources and harming the environment.\"\n\nThe Brazilian government has faced intense criticism for policies environmentalists believe have encouraged the fires.\n\nBut Environment Minister Ricardo Salles told the Victoria Derbyshire programme pressure to shun Brazilian soya would be counterproductive.\n\n\"We need sustainable economic development... and boycotts or behaviours like this will only make things even worse,\" he said.\n\nFollow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here.", "description": "Greenpeace asks fast-food chains to stop selling meat from animals fed on soya from Brazil.", "authors": ["Jim Reed", "Joseph Lee", "Victoria Derbyshire Programme"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/177CD/production/_109150269_gettyimages-1014721800.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
