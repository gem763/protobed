REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido\n\nThe survey, published in local daily La Tercera, was conducted by Chilean pollster Cadem between Wednesday and Thursday. It came just before a rally that saw 1 million Chileans, or just under one-fifth the city\u2019s population, take to the streets Friday to call for reforms to the country\u2019s social and economic model.\n\nDaily La Tercera called Pinera\u2019s 14% approval rating a \u201chistorical minimum,\u201d and the lowest since the 1973-1990 military rule of dictator Augusto Pinochet. More than three-quarters of Chileans disapproved of the centre-right Pinera\u2019s administration, the poll found.\n\nChile, the world\u2019s top copper producer, has long been one of the region\u2019s most prosperous and stable free-market economies. But entrenched inequality and spiralling costs of living ignited massive, and sometimes violent, protests last week.\n\nSimilar scenes have played out in cities across the world in recent months, from Hong Kong to Beirut to Barcelona, sharing in common anger at ruling elites.\n\nIn Chile, a hike in subway fares more than a week ago proved the breaking point. Small protests quickly boiled over into riots that have killed at least 17 people, resulted in more than 7,000 arrests and caused upwards of $1.4 billion in losses to Chilean businesses.\n\nPinera, a billionaire businessman, last week called for a new \u201csocial pact,\u201d to stem the unrest. He promised higher taxes on the rich to help boost the minimum wage and pensions, lower the prices of medicines and assure proper health insurance.\n\nThe Cadem poll found that 80% of Chileans did not think his reforms were adequate.\n\nRoberto Izikson, a pollster and political scientist with Cadem, told Reuters Pinera\u2019s ratings were already trending downwards before the protests began.\n\n\u201cWe will see how the government plays the last few cards it holds to confront this new scenario,\u201d Izikson said.\n\nThe centre-right Pinera trounced the leftist opposition during 2017 elections. But mass rallies forcing Pinera to change his tone and upend his policy goals.\n\nOn Saturday, Pinera promised a major cabinet shake-up, though he has yet to announce details.", "description": "Support for Chile's Sebastian Pinera has plunged to just 14% amid recent unrest, according to a poll published on Sunday, the lowest approval rating for a Chilean president since the country's return to democracy three decades ago.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445612764&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0S0", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
