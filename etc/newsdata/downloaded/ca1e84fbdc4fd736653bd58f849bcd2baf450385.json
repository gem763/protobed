NBCU announced today that its new service, Peacock, will launch in April, and it will be the new exclusive home of Parks and Recreation. The show is currently available all over the place: Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime. But come October of next year, you\u2019ll need Peacock if you want to visit all your friends in Pawnee.\n\nAs was previously reported by Vulture, \u201cthe new service has also locked down deals for a slew of originals with ties to existing NBCU brands, including a reboot of Battlestar Galactica overseen by Sam Esmail (Mr. Robot), revivals of Saved by the Bell and Punky Brewster, a comedy/talk show hosted by Late Night\u2019s Amber Ruffin, a new spinoff from The Real Housewives universe, and a new comedy from The Good Place creator Mike Schur starring The Office\u2019s Ed Helms. There\u2019ll also be dozens of films from the Universal library, new animated shows from DreamWorks Animation, and even reruns of Downton Abbey.\u201d Peacock will also house 30 Rock, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Cheers, Frasier, and Saturday Night Live, but those titles won\u2019t belong exclusively to the new service.", "description": "\u201cParks and Recreation\u201d will leave every other platform it\u2019s streaming on and will live exclusively on NBC\u2019s own streaming platform.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/02/23/23-leslie-ann.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
