The 21-year-old is the best player they can boast as their own across the Atlantic and his ongoing failure to hit the net following a \u00a358m summer move from Borussia Dortmund caused much gnashing of pearly whites across the US.\n\nThis was the guy who was supposed to destroy the stereotype that Americans are only good at football when they are wearing oversized shoulder pads and coming off for a breather every five minutes. The guy who could show that those from the US could cut it at elite level.\n\nChristian Pulisic bagged a sensational hat-trick in his first Premier League start since August\n\nThe American scored after 21 minutes, instantly rewarding Frank Lampard's selection\n\nLampard was delighted, as Pulisic's desire to break into the XI will have encouraged his boss\n\nOn a chilly night in the Lancashire hills, Pulisic was on fire. A glimpse that the young forward was on it came early, when Tammy Abraham had the nerve to go for a pass he clearly thought was his.\n\nAs the ball dribbled out of play, the American \u2013 playing behind Abraham in the left of a three - gave his English teammate the glare of a veteran. This was Pulisic's first league start since August and he wasted little time in ridding himself of the unwanted stat.\n\nHis first goal was a beauty.\n\nPicking up the ball 45 yards out, after Burnley full-back Matthew Lowton inexplicably fell on his backside, the Hershey, Pennsylvania native \u2013 home of the famous chocolate bar \u2013 sensed that it was time for a piece of the action.\n\nPulisic made it the perfect hat-trick with a header after Mason Mount's pinpoint cross\n\nThe winger was bright from the start, looking to take players on and keen to get the ball\n\nImmediately he raced at goal, showing an explosive turn of pace that was too much for James Tarkowski before angling a cute low drive through the legs of Ben Mee and inside a helpless Nick Pope's far post.\n\nThe celebration, a knee slide to the corner flag, defied his record. It was the celebration of a man who is used to scoring goals, a man who oozes confidence.\n\nMuch has been made of Frank Lampard's handling of Pulisic. Here, it looked like a work of genius. Clearly fired-up, Pulisic was quickly at it again when another Burnley mistake prompted another clear sight of goal.\n\nThis time it was a misplaced pass and this time, after another surge at goal, it was his right foot that did the damage, albeit with a helpful deflection off Mee.\n\nThe third \u2013 a back header from a Mason Mount cross, capped an evening that, with Halloween around the corner, put a few ghosts to bed. 'USA, USA,' came the chant from the away end. No doubt it was echoed thousands of miles away.", "description": "MIKE KEEGAN AT TURF MOOR: It\u00a0was a perfect hat-trick scored for Chelsea , in Burnley , but celebrated in New York, Boston and San Francisco.", "authors": ["Mike Keegan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/19/20222392-0-image-a-116_1572113981155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
