I guess everybody has a shot. But I don\u2019t think he would be frankly my toughest opponent either,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd just to finish off, I don\u2019t think that he will win.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump said Friday he never thought that former Vice President Joe Biden was going to win the Democrat nomination in 2020.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178678561-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
