Then you should probably update to iOS 13 if you haven\u2019t already. iOS 13 includes a couple of new tools for blocking junk emails and robocalls, and carries over the iMessage blocking options from iOS 12. These make it easy to filter out unwanted messages at the source \u2014 whether from specific contacts or en masse. Even better, any numbers or email addresses you block from an iPhone will be blocked on your other Apple devices as well. Here\u2019s how:\n\nBlocking unwanted email\n\nFirst, you can block specific contacts from the iOS Mail app by opening a message and tapping the sender\u2019s email address. Tap \u201cBlock This Contact\u201d button. Next, go to Settings > Mail and turn on \u201cIgnore Blocked Senders.\u201d You can also go to Settings > Mail > Blocked to add to/manage your list of blocked contacts.\n\nBlocking unknown callers\n\nGo to Settings > phone and turn on \u201cSilence Unknown Callers.\u201d This disables ringing and notifications for calls from unknown numbers which should cut down on spam and robocalls, but be aware this could also block important calls from numbers you don\u2019t have saved. It would be smart to turn this off if you\u2019re expecting an important phone call from a number you don\u2019t know or don\u2019t have saved.\n\nBlocking iMessage contacts\n\nWhile you\u2019ve technically been able to block contacts in iMessage since iOS 12, the method for blocking is quite similar to blocking email addresses and phone numbers. Under Settings > Messages, turn on \u201cFilter unknown senders.\u201d\n\nJust be mindful that this will prevent you from seeing messages from all unknown senders, much like when blocking unknown numbers, so be careful about when you have this setting enabled, and be sure to check your folder of filtered messages if you\u2019re expecting to hear from someone.", "description": "Is your iPhone getting blown up with spammy messages?
