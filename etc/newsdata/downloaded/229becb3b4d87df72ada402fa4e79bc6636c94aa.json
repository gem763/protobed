He explained his vision to staff at January\u2019s Summit, an all-hands meeting in Los Angeles, according to a video clip reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nSee more: The Kabbalah Connection: Insiders say a celebrity-centered religious sect deeply influenced how Adam Neumann ran WeWork before its spectacular collapse\n\nThe source who provided the video is not authorized to speak to media, but said the remarks were so standard for the unconventional founder that staff did not react.\n\ncaption Adam Neumann\u2019s Summit speech source Source video\n\nIn the video, Neumann appears to respond to a question about WeWork\u2019s investors.\n\n\u201cWeWork is a controlled company, people don\u2019t know that,\u201d he tells the audience. \u201cI, Adam, and my family control the company 100%, very rare when you have investors. It\u2019s not the truth of any company in the world, Google still has it a little bit, Facebook and Mark [Zuckerberg] already lost it, no other company else has it.\u201d\n\nThe Neumanns made some plans that hinted at how they would keep this control. In WeWork\u2019s original August filing to go public, Adam Neumann received 20 votes per share of his stock, an unusual structure even by Silicon Valley standards.\n\nAnd if something happened to Adam, Rebekah Neumann would play a major role in succession planning. If Adam were permanently disabled or died in the decade following the IPO, Rebekah would be one of a two or three-member committee who would select the new CEO. If both Rebekah and Adam were unable to participate in the selection, the trustee of their estate would step into Rebekah\u2019s shoes.\n\nIn subsequent filings, WeWork reduced Adam\u2019s voting power and banned Neumann family members from the board. A representative for Neumann couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\n\u2018Stay the moral compass of the company\u2019\n\nIn the January video, Neumann highlights his long-term plan for the company. He and his wife Rebekah have five young children, whose involvement at WeWork included attending WeGrow, the school that\u2019s closing at the end of the academic year, and flying on WeWork\u2019s private jet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just controlled; we\u2019re generationally controlled,\u201d Neumann said.\n\nSee more: Sex, tequila, and a tiger: Employees inside Adam Neumann\u2019s WeWork talk about the nonstop party to attain a $100 billion dream and the messy reality that tanked it\n\nHe added that he didn\u2019t expect his children to be future WeWork CEOs, as he was before his ouster last month. Neumann said he worried that his children wouldn\u2019t \u201cearn\u201d leadership, and he would prefer a leader who \u201cgrew from the bottom.\u201d\n\nEven if the Neumann children didn\u2019t lead the company, he still thought they would be involved.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to run the company, but they do have to stay the moral compass of the company. If we do this right, over the years, different CEOs will come, but we will keep an eye on these basic values and basic moral standards and not allow them to shift.\u201d\n\nNeumann intended this plan to work for the long term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that one day, maybe in 100 years, maybe in 300 years, a great-great granddaughter of mine will walk into that room and say, \u2018Hey, you don\u2019t know me; I actually control the place. The way you\u2019re acting is not how we built it.'\u201d\n\nNeumann was replaced last month with two co-CEOs after a tumultuous lead-up to an initial public offering that was ultimately shelved. Investors cited a number of concerns with his leadership, including conflicts of interest with his family. Rebekah, who was credited as a co-founder and led WeGrow, also stepped back from her roles.\n\nGot a tip?
