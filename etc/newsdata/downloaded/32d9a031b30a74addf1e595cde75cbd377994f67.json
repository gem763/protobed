Almost every department and agency is desperately looking right now for ways to get back into this game.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t, Huawei could soon be the only option for anyone wanting to roll out 5G networks.\u201d\n\nAnother said: \u201cThis is one of the big concerns of the government right now. Everyone from the defence department, to the commerce department, to the department of homeland security, is looking at this.\u201d The White House declined to comment.", "description": "Officials in the US government have suggested issuing credit to companies such as Nokia and Ericsson to enable them to match the generous financing terms that Huawei offers to its customers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4017%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_556%2C$y_236/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b42957ade23494918f5644e20afad602f4ede000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
