He was 85.\n\nHis death was announced by Ohio State. No further information was available.\n\nIn addition to his football exploits, Mr. Cassady also played baseball at Ohio State and was a longtime coach and official in the New York Yankees organization. The Yankees\u2019 owner, George Steinbrenner, a longtime friend of Mr. Cassady, was the first to tell him he had won the Heisman.\n\nMr. Cassady was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1979. When he left Ohio State, he held school records for career rushing yards, all-purpose yards and scoring.\n\n\u201cIn those days, if I had 100 yards in the first half I wouldn\u2019t play in the second half,\u201d he said during a 2001 interview with the Associated Press.\n\nMr. Cassady, whose No. 40 jersey number was retired by Ohio State in 2001, was nicknamed \u201cHopalong\u201d by local sportswriters in his first game as a freshman in 1952, when he scored three touchdowns in a 33-13 win over Indiana and \u201chopped all over the field like the performing cowboy.\u201d It was a tribute to movie actor Hopalong Cassidy, the cowboy star of the 1950s who posed with the football star for a memorable photo at the 1955 Rose Bowl.\n\n\n\nOhio State halfback Howard \u201cHopalong\u201d Cassady. (AP)\n\nThe Columbus native was a four-year starter and letter winner and a two-time consensus all-American for the Buckeyes. He rushed for 2,466 yards and scored 37 touchdowns in his 36 games at Ohio State. During his four years under coach Woody Hayes, he averaged almost six yards a carry.\n\nMr. Cassady was a skinny, 155-pound freshman running back for Hayes, who was under fire for finishing in a tie for fifth in the Big Ten his first season.\n\nMr. Cassady caught Hayes\u2019s attention by consistently scoring on the varsity in practice. But it wasn\u2019t until the Thursday before OSU\u2019s opener against Indiana that Hayes told Mr. Cassady to get a uniform.\n\n\u201cThat was a big deal because Mom and Dad got tickets if you dressed,\u201d said Mr. Cassady, who picked the number 40 because the only other number left was 13.\n\nIn the middle of the third quarter with Indiana up 14-0, Hayes told his coaches to \u201cput the redhead in,\u201d and Mr. Cassady took his first punt return to Indiana\u2019s 45-yard line. He went on to score three touchdowns as the Buckeyes won.\n\nHe caught 43 passes for 619 yards and four more touchdowns during his career. He also starred on kickoff and punt returns. It was said that as a defensive back he never had a pass completed over him in four years of Big Ten competition. He returned an interception 88 yards for a touchdown in a 1954 comeback victory over Wisconsin.\n\nAs a junior, Mr. Cassady rushed for 701 yards and eight touchdowns when the Buckeyes went 10-0 and won the national championship. He was third in the Heisman voting.\n\nIn his senior year, Mr. Cassady carried 161 times for 958 yards (5.9 per attempt) and ran for 14 touchdowns. He was named \u201cAthlete of the Year\u201d by the Associated Press and other organizations.\n\nHe was the third of Ohio State\u2019s seven Heisman Trophy winners, at the time following Les Horvath (1944) and Vic Janowicz (1950). He also won the Maxwell Trophy, an award as prestigious as the Heisman at the time, as the country\u2019s best college player.\n\nMr. Cassady squeezed in baseball at college for four seasons, starting for three years as shortstop. In 1955, when Ohio State won the Big Ten championship, Mr. Cassady had more home runs than his teammate Frank Howard, who went on to play 16 years in the majors.\n\nAfter graduation, however, Cassady passed on the chance to play professional baseball.\n\n\u201cI could have signed for $10,000 with the Yankees, but I would have had to go through the minors,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the No. 1 draft choice I could start right away playing football.\u201d\n\nThe Detroit Lions offered him a signing bonus of $15,000 that matched his annual salary. He played for eight seasons with the Lions, one with the Cleveland Browns and one with the Philadelphia Eagles before retiring after the 1963 season.\n\nMr. Cassady ran a concrete pipe business, sold steel and later worked for Steinbrenner at American Shipbuilding in Tampa.\n\nFor almost 20 seasons, Mr. Cassady was a first-base coach for the Triple-A Columbus Clippers, the top farm club of the Yankees. He traced his friendship with Steinbrenner to the 1950s when Mr. Cassady received ROTC training at the former Lockbourne Air Force base near Columbus, where Steinbrenner coached the baseball team.\n\nMr. Cassady\u2019s son Craig was a three-time letter-winner as a defensive back at Ohio State and shares the school record for interceptions in a game with three.\n\nHis marriage to Betty Gehring ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife, Barbara, and three sons.\n\n\u2014 Associated Press", "description": "He was a two-time all-American for the Buckeyes and later was a minor-league baseball coach.", "authors": ["Andrew Welsh-Huggins", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XUzX6BlC8xb1iwWf1tXmjiTxumk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MPK7SLG3YUI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
