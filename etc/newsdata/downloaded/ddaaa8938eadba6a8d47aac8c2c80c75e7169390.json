Our success here could trigger the dismantling of the coalition in Berlin,\" said Alice Weidel, leader of the AfD's national parliamentary party.\n\n\"The other parties can't continue with business as usual.\"\n\nThe AfD's success will certainly make coalition building difficult for the CDU conservatives in Saxony, which they have governed for almost three decades, and for the SPD in Brandenburg where the centre-left party has ruled since 1990.\n\nOne of the SPD's interim leaders, Manuela Schwesig, expressed concern about the AfD's strength.\n\n\"Our task must be to work out why so many chose to protest in this way. We must all be aware that the AfD's results show we must take account of the concerns of people in the East,\" she said.", "description": "An emboldened far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) warned Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition partners they could not carry on as before.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106107389-1567411360702gettyimages-1165483786.jpg?v=1567411415"}
