Those who paid for the Full Self-Driving option on their car are higher up on the priority list, with a wider release coming in \u201cabout a week\u201d containing \u201cslight improvements\u201d from this build, according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Tesla says this is its largest software update ever to this point and highlights all the improvements as a key advantage of buying one of the company\u2019s cars.\n\nSoftware Version 10.0 \u2014 you\u2019d think Musk would\u2019ve branded it by now \u2014 includes a lot of new entertainment options for Tesla drivers. Spotify Premium, Netflix, YouTube, and Hulu (including with live TV) are now available. The video services can only be viewed when a vehicle is parked, but Spotify integration has been a huge request among Tesla\u2019s customers, the company says, and that obviously works all the time. Also, people who stream their music over Bluetooth will appreciate that album art now shows up on the Tesla display.\n\nThe other new fun factor features include \u201cCaraoke,\u201d which \u201clets you sing your heart out with friends on a road trip \u2014 or by yourself. Caraoke comes with a massive library of music and song lyrics, with support for multiple languages.\u201d Song lyrics are displayed in sync with the song on the Tesla\u2019s display. And the first level of Cuphead has been added to Tesla Arcade.\n\nTesla is also replicating a popular Google trick: \u201cI\u2019m feeling lucky.\u201d You can select this option for either food (\u201cI\u2019m feeling hungry\u201d) or points of interest (\u201cI\u2019m feeling lucky\u201d). \u201cIn testing, we\u2019ve been taken to hole-in-the-wall restaurants, gourmet meals, national parks, city landmarks and more,\u201d the company wrote in its blog post.\n\nAs for driving and core vehicle functionality, Tesla has launched \u201cSmart Summon\u201d and added new functionality beyond the regular Summon feature, which still exists separately. Smart Summon \u2014 exclusive to Full Self-Driving and Enhanced Autopilot customers \u2014 enables a Tesla vehicle to leave a parking space and navigate around obstacles to its owner. The car must be in your line of sight for Smart Summon to work. Video recordings captured when Teslas are in their self-protect Sentry Mode are now stored in a separate folder from other camera content. A new \u201cJoe Mode\u201d is meant to avoid waking up sleeping passengers by reducing the volume of certain car chimes and alerts. And the Tesla mobile app can do a few more things and control even more aspects of the car remotely (like the windows).\n\nAs for when customers can expect it, Tesla says:", "description": "Tesla has begun rolling out its biggest software update ever, and it adds Spotify Premium, Netflix, YouTube, and Hulu to Model S, X, and 3 vehicles.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q5awHJb1IFGYU4uM6xZnR6V59lM=/0x248:2040x1316/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10228141/jbareham_180213_2301_0099.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
