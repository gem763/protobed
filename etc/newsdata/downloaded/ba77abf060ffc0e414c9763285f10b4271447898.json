Players and coaches from both teams have decried the incident, which in recent days has sparked widespread consternation.\n\n\u201cThe fact it happened to a women\u2019s sports team essentially put us back a little bit. I think it\u2019s very unfortunate the decision-making process wasn\u2019t thought out more,\u201d Temple Coach Susan Ciufo told The Washington Post. \u201cI know we\u2019re not a big-revenue sport, but to make young women feel what they did for 70 minutes doesn\u2019t really matter, what are we telling young female athletes about what it means to be an athlete?\u201d\n\nCollege basketball player in Arkansas says coach dismissed him because of his dreadlocks\n\nCiufo said both teams did everything they could to finish the game \u2014 even lobbying for an early shootout or shortened second overtime \u2014 to no avail. The coach said she felt especially bad for her players, who had nearly seized on a rare opportunity to beat a ranked opponent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 2019,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of absurd this happened.\u201d\n\nThe University of Maine field hockey Twitter account addressed the situation in a Saturday morning tweet, and senior forward Riley Field expressed her disappointment in a series of tweets of her own. She also posted a video of the fireworks display, which she noted took place at noon \u2014 more than an hour after the first overtime concluded.\n\nthese are the fireworks that we were kicked off of the field hockey field for... which was behind the stadium. pic.twitter.com/UKBNWA617N \u2014 Riley Field (@RileyField11) September 7, 2019\n\nCritics demanded answers from Kent State Athletic Director Joel Nielsen, who in a statement apologized to players and coaches from both teams. He said Monday the university had \u201creviewed and altered our procedures to see that no student-athletes are faced with this situation in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, a different decision should have been made to ultimately ensure the game reached its conclusion. We hold ourselves to a very high standard, and in this situation, we failed,\u201d Nielsen wrote. \u201cI realize that my statement does not undo the negative impact on the student-athletes, coaches, staff and fans who deserved to see their teams compete in a full contest.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the National Field Hockey Coaches Association decried the unpreparedness of Kent State officials, calling the incident \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cextremely damaging.\u201d According to the NFHCA, both Maine and Temple were notified of the cutoff time in a May email, which was necessary to accommodate fire marshal regulations. But, the organization added, \u201cKent State University failed to communicate the steps that would be taken should the 10:30 a.m. hard stop be reached.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we understand that the fireworks were deemed to be an important part of Kent State University\u2019s Family Weekend festivities which featured the home football contest, we cannot understand why the university would seemingly prioritize a daytime fireworks display over the completion of a Division I Women\u2019s Field Hockey contest,\u201d the NFHCA wrote Monday. \u201cThe optics and the messaging to every field hockey program and to every field hockey player are that while they matter, they don\u2019t matter more than pregame football festivities.\u201d\n\nKent State reportedly offered to resume the game later that day at 5:30 p.m. \u2014 seven hours later \u2014 but players and coaches from both teams said that was not feasible. It is unlikely the game would be completed at a later date.\n\nQB has \u2018angel on the field\u2019 in his late brother, and a storybook college football debut\n\nAddressing reporters Monday, Field said she assumed the Kent State officials were joking when they instructed players to clear the field Saturday. The shock didn\u2019t set in until later that day, she said, which inspired her to tweet about the issue.\n\nThe video of the fireworks was to allow people to see exactly what Kent State had prioritized over their game, she added.\n\nSome have speculated the decision may be a Title IX violation. Maine Coach Josette Babineau said the NCAA had reached out to the team Monday to gather more information.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s brought up a lot of emotions, and first and foremost that\u2019s offensive and upsetting to think that because of your gender your sport is looked at as less,\u201d Field said. \u201cWe work as hard as any men\u2019s team. They work extremely hard. We work extremely hard at a Division I level.\u201d\n\nMaine faced off against Kent State\u2019s field hockey team Sunday morning in a game players described as an emotional outing. Clouded by the prior day\u2019s events, Field said she and her teammates had trouble clearing their minds before the game. They lost, 2-1.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to hold your shoulders up when you feel like you\u2019ve just been brushed off or looked at as less than. I felt like a joke,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt they didn\u2019t recognize Division I women\u2019s field hockey is legit. They felt football was more legit than we are.\u201d\n\nCoaches from both teams say they hope Saturday\u2019s ordeal places a spotlight on discrimination in women\u2019s sports. Addressing reporters Monday, Babineau described how much her players fight for their school and each other.\n\n\u201cThat part was taken away from them on Saturday, and it left them feeling like their talent, effort and sacrifice may not matter or is not valued,\u201d Babineau said. Speaking to her team, she added: \u201cWe need to do everything we can at U-Maine to make sure you never have to feel those feelings again.\u201d\n\nRead More:\n\nArmy is officially the team no College Football Playoff contender wants to play\n\nQB has \u2018angel on the field\u2019 in his late brother, and a storybook college football debut\n\nMaryland shreds Syracuse, setting program record for points vs. ranked opponent", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s 2019,\u201d Temple Coach Susan Ciufo said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of absurd this happened.\u201d", "authors": ["Michael Brice-Saddler", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/54XRUHWLKJHWLHV4JOJRLVEFIY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
