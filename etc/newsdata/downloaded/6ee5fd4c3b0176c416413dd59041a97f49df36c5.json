That's what it took Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge to break the world marathon record last weekend in Berlin.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nJust a few years ago, no one thought a human could run a marathon in under two hours. But yesterday in Berlin, Eliud Kipchoge shattered the world record and ran 26.2 miles in 2 hours, 1 minute and 39 seconds. Two hours now seems inevitable. NPR's Eyder Peralta reports on how humanity got here.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Crowds at the German capital roar him on.\n\nEYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: By the time he runs under the Brandenburg Gate, Eliud Kipchoge knows he's about to shatter the world record.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: He comes towards the line, raises a sprint on those magical legs. And at last the world record is his.\n\nPERALTA: Kipchoge breaks the world record by more than a minute, an almost unbelievable feat. But one thing that was not a surprise is that a Kenyan was breaking another Kenyan's world record. Just think about this. Last year, 187 men ran marathons under 2 hours and 10 minutes; 113 of them were Kenyans, but only one American made that list.\n\nADHARANAND FINN: Kenyans have this brilliant ability not to fear running, not to see it as something that's going to hurt but just to accept it.\n\nPERALTA: That's at Adharanand Finn. He's the author of \"Running With The Kenyans,\" which dissects why Kenyans are such good runners. He explored the high altitude, their high-carb diet, their monk-like dedication. But he couldn't pin down a secret sauce.\n\nFINN: It's a whole combination of factors coming together. It's, like, the perfect storm of circumstances, really.\n\nPERALTA: This hunt for a sub-two-hour marathon started more than a year ago for Kipchoge. Nike, his sponsor, poured tons of money into finding the perfect conditions for a human to overcome that hurdle. They studied humidity and how to reduce lactic acid. They redesigned shoes and set up a test run.\n\nNational Geographic produced a documentary in which Kipchoge comes off as a Zen master - a tranquil smile, a seamless running form and a metaphysical outlook. This is not about legs, he says. It's about the heart and mind.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"BREAKING2\")\n\nELIUD KIPCHOGE: I feel that I have a potential inside my heart that I can go beyond human limitation.\n\nPERALTA: In the end, he missed the two-hour mark by a mere 25 seconds. Kipchoge wasn't awarded the world record because the course didn't meet the specifications. But at the time, it put the two-hour marathon within reach.\n\nPETER WEYAND: The elephant in the room is the shoes on his feet.\n\nPERALTA: That is Peter Weyand, who studies the limits of human performance at Southern Methodist University. He says sports companies have been trying to make a better running shoe for decades. And in the past few years, Nike seems to have hit jackpot with the Vaporfly 4 percent. According to a 2017 peer-reviewed study, an elite athlete can run 3.5 percent faster with those shoes.\n\nWEYAND: But if you accept the results so far, then they are performance-enhancing shoes.\n\nPERALTA: So in Weyand's mind anyway, it puts Kipchoge's feet in question because Dennis Kimetto did not run in those shoes when he set the marathon record back in 2014.
