Unnamed US officials were also quoted in US media outlets as saying Iranian cruise missiles were used in Saturday\u2019s attack on an oil field and processing plant. Estimates of the number of missiles used ranged from \u201cnearly a dozen\u201d to \u201cover two dozen\u201d.\n\nBut Trump suggested on Monday the US did not have definitive evidence, adding that he would send the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to Riyadh to investigate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to find out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere are lots of different pieces to look at.\u201d\n\nIran has denied responsibility, and the country\u2019s president appeared to endorse a claim of responsibility by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebel group.\n\nSpeaking in Ankara, Hassan Rouhani said: \u201cYemeni people are exercising their legitimate right of defence \u2026 the attacks were a reciprocal response to aggression against Yemen for years.\u201d\n\nIntelligence officials in the region said they believed drones or missiles were used in the attack, in what appeared to be a carefully aimed strike at the heart of the Saudi economy.\n\n\u201cThere was hardly a more strategic target they could have hit,\u201d said one official. \u201cThey\u2019ve looked at the map and said: \u2018Where could we cause most damage.\u2019 These were the hubs of their production across the country. Those sending the drones well knew the address.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday, Trump declared the US was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d, but left it to the Saudi government to confirm Iranian involvement and the nature of the US reaction, in an apparent attempt to make the monarchy take full responsibility for any reprisal action.\n\nAsked on Monday whether he had pledged to protect Saudi Arabia, the president told reporters: \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t promised the Saudis that ... We have to sit down with the Saudis and work something out.\u201d\n\nLater in the day, Trump stressed that if there were to be a retaliatory strike, Riyadh would have to play a leading role, especially when it came to paying for it.\n\n\u201cThe fact is the Saudis are going to have a lot of involvement in this, if we decide to do something,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThey\u2019ll be very much involved, and that includes payment. And they understand that fully.\u201d\n\nAs to whether diplomacy with Iran had been exhausted, Trump said: \u201cNo, it\u2019s never exhausted ... You never know what\u2019s going to happen ... I know they want to make a deal ... At some point it will work out.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Saudi military spokesman for the Riyadh-led coalition fighting in Yemen that Iranian-made weapons were used in the attack but stopped short of blaming Iran.\n\n\u201cThe investigation is continuing and all indications are that weapons used in both attacks came from Iran,\u201d Col Turki al-Maliki told reporters in Riyadh, according to the French press agency, AFP. He said the attacks had not been launched from Yemen and there was an investigation into \u201cfrom where they were fired\u201d.\n\nIraqi officials said that Pompeo told them that the attack was not carried out from Iraqi soil and instead appeared to launched from neighbouring Iran.\n\nTwo aides to senior Iraqi leaders say Pompeo passed on to the claim in a phone call to the Iraqi prime minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, in the early hours of Monday. The call allayed mounting fears in Baghdad that an Iranian proxy force composed of Iraqis might have launched the drones believed to have carried out the devastating strike without the knowledge of the central government.\n\nBut the Wall Street Journal quoted Saudi officials as saying their US counterparts had not provided enough evidence to conclude definitively that the attack was launched from Iran.\n\nOn Monday, Trump stressed that it was Saudi Arabia not the US that had been attacked and played down the US national security interest in the Gulf, pointing to the fact that the US has become the world\u2019s biggest energy producer.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas, & in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nA senior White House official \u2013 the vice-president\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short \u2013 argued that when the president had said the US was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d, it was a reference to the country\u2019s self sufficiency in energy.\n\n\u201cI think that \u2018locked and loaded\u2019 is a broad term and talks about the realities that we\u2019re all far safer and more secure domestically from energy independence,\u201d Short said.\n\nEverything you need to know about the Saudi Arabia oil attacks Read more\n\nThe remarks seemed to be aimed at keeping the president\u2019s options open on a response to the attack, which knocked out half Saudi production, 5% of global production and triggered a spike in oil prices. But the administration also showed determination that the world held Iran responsible.\n\nLike Pompeo, who accused Iran of responsibility for the attack on Saturday, the US energy secretary, Rick Perry, left no room for doubt about culpability.\n\n\u201cThe United States wholeheartedly condemns Iran\u2019s attacks on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and we call on other nations to do the same,\u201d Perry said during a trip to Vienna.\n\nAsked on CNBC what the response should be, Perry said: \u201cI think there will be a coalition effort, both our friends in the Middle East that understand having a crazy neighbor is a real problem \u2026 [and] all those countries in that region should have the hair on the back of their necks standing up watching a country attack someone to manipulate the energy market.\u201d\n\nThe UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab tweeted on Monday:\n\nDominic Raab (@DominicRaab) Today, I spoke with my Saudi\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udde6 German\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea French\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 and US\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 counterparts to make clear the UK condemns the attack on the Aramco oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. We will work with international partners to forge the widest and most effective response.\n\nSpeaking to the UN security council, Britain\u2019s Karen Pierce said: \u201cWe are still assessing what happened and who is responsible for these attacks. Once this has been established, we will discuss with our allies and partners how to proceed in a responsible manner. We need a united international response to these despicable attacks.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Mohammed Rasool", "description": "US secretaries of state and energy both explicitly blamed Iran for the attack but Trump suggests US did not have definitive evidence", "authors": ["Julian Borger", "Martin Chulov"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b2b997b1e016a5d83474d2997fc71dd6f838831/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd4deb133c8e49682ee974297d6beff4", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
