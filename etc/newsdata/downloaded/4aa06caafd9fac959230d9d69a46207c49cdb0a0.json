For example, a person in New York needs to spend $115.80 to get the same goods that a person in Delaware pays $100.10 for, whereas a Mississippi resident would pay $85.70.\n\nBased on this buying power, we then calculated how much a family of four actually to needs to make to be at the poverty line. Based on the example above, a New York family must earn $29,818 to have the buying power of a typical American family at the poverty line, whereas the threshold for a Delaware or Mississippi family is lower \u2014 $25,776 and $22,067, respectively.\n\nBelow, see what's considered \"poor\" in every state, ranked from lowest to highest salary needed to be at the poverty line based on buying power.", "description": "To better understand what it means to be \"poor\" in each state, we calculated the income it takes to be at the poverty level based on regional price differences.", "authors": ["Hillary Hoffower", "Erin Mcdowell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5bf2f24d8c35ab67f634c387?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
