REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File Photo\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp (TRI.TO) is engaged in succession planning for Chief Executive Jim Smith as \u201ca matter of good governance,\u201d the business information company said on Sunday.\n\nThe company statement here came after the Financial Times reported Thomson Reuters had begun a search for a new chief executive.\n\nDavid Thomson, the company\u2019s chairman, said the board \u201cis fully supportive of Jim Smith and his management team. We are aligned on strategy and direction.\u201d\n\nSmith said in a memo to employees he was actively involved in the succession planning process.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, I\u2019m not planning to go anywhere soon,\u201d Smith said. \u201cPlease know that when the time comes to hand over the reins, you will hear it from me.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Times cited four unnamed sources as saying Thomson Reuters, which owns the Reuters news agency, had hired search firm Spencer Stuart to put together a list of internal and external candidates. The search was at an early stage, the newspaper said.\n\nIn a statement, Thomson Reuters said: \u201cThe Board of Directors considers succession planning and benchmarking for all key executives a matter of good governance. Hence, the Board and management continuously assess internal candidates and work with search firms to scan the external market.\u201d\n\nSpencer Stuart declined to comment and a spokesman for Thomson Reuters declined to comment specifically on whether it had engaged Spencer Stuart.\n\nSmith oversaw the sale of a majority stake in the news and information provider\u2019s financial-data business to a Blackstone Group Inc-led (BX.N) consortium last year. Earlier this year, Blackstone agreed to sell the financial-data business, now called Refinitiv, to London Stock Exchange Group (LSE.L) for $27 billion (21 billion pounds).", "description": "Thomson Reuters Corp is engaged in succession planning for Chief Executive Jim Smith as \"a matter of good governance,\" the business information company said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443164647&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0R1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
