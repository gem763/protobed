I was the face on the covers, I was the eyebrows or the face or whatever the thing was that people and the press and everybody focused on,\u201d she shared. \u201cAnd because I was never really skinny, I never did runway. So I was always the one that was doing the magazines but often never fit into the samples.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Shields said that she held onto the belief \u201cthat I didn\u2019t look good, that I didn\u2019t have a good body.\u201d She even went on to explain the deeper impact of being sexualized from a young age as well, while simultaneously being praised for her youthful innocence.\n\n\u201cIt was said that I was the most famous virgin, which is really great to live with,\u201d Shields joked. \u201cHow do you justify sexy screen siren and famous virgin? It\u2019s a real disconnect and it\u2019s really hard. And so, I look back and I think, I\u2019m still surviving and I can\u2019t believe that I didn\u2019t turn into a train wreck. Seriously.\u201d\n\nNow, the mother-of-two is taking measures to ensure that she takes proper care of her body in an effort to provide her daughters with a good example of self love and confidence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to present to them the image of a whole woman, which was very different from the way I grew up,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to have any of that shame but I want them to maintain a sense of that their body is their body, it\u2019s their own.\u201d\n\nShields even admitted that her wildly popular bikini photos are a result of that lesson, as her daughters, ages 13 and 16, have encouraged her to show all of her hard work off.\n\n\u201cThose pictures always get a gazillion likes. And it was my daughters who actually told me to do it because I felt very embarrassed,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy girls were like, \u2018Mom, this is current. This is what the world is now and you should be proud because you do work hard.\u2019\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Brooke Shields admits that while she was \"the face on covers,\" she struggled to embrace her body while growing up in the public eye.", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/njjv4pjic016jYPTJq44CA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/build_912/8cc7cf5d30240c0ac91644a47ddc9093", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
