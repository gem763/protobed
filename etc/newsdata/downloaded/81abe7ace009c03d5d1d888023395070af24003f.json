His statements are so extreme that even his own party members struggle to differentiate them from the writings of Adolf Hitler.\n\nMr Hoecke told supporters on Sunday that the AfD \u201cwill be a people\u2019s party for all of Germany\u201d, adding that the preliminary result was \u201ca clear sign that a large part of Thuringia says this can\u2019t go on, we need renewal ... This should be taken seriously.\u201d\n\nThe left-wing Die Linke party, which has governed the region in coalition with the Greens and Social Democrats (SDP), won the highest share of the vote with 30.1 per cent while the German chancellor\u2019s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) came third with 22.1 per cent.\n\nIt marked a significant slump in CDU support compared to 2014, when the party won the highest share of the vote with 33.5 per cent.\n\nThe SPD also lost votes, coming forth with just over 8 per cent. It means that the existing \u201cred-red-green\u201d coalition is unlikely to be able to command a majority in state parliament.\n\nA Die Linke minority government is said to be the most likely outcome, given that the CDU has ruled out a coalition with either them or the AfD.\n\nBodo Ramelow, who became Die Linke\u2019s first state premier in 2014, said: \u201cI see myself clearly strengthened. My party clearly has the mandate to govern, and I will take it up.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nAfD chief\u2019s statements \u2018indistinguishable from Hitler\u2019 to his own MPs", "description": "The German far right won a higher share of the vote than Angela Merkel\u2019s party in a regional election on Sunday, according to exit polls.Alternative for Germany (AfD) was forecast to come second in the poll in the state of Thuringia with 23.5 per cent, more than double what it received five years ago", "authors": ["Peter Stubley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/M8v4uDd7ZM3bMX6ONQokxQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/03033cd2d33c0249b58f78cacda00596", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
