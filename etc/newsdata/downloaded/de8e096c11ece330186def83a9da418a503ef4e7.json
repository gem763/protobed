If interest rates go to zero, there will probably still be people drawn into the market [and it might still go higher] but the big risk is the opposite.\"\n\nIf we get co-ordinated fiscal spend \"maybe that will be it\".\n\n\"Australia is unique, we had this interesting discussion about banks not passing on the [rate cut],\" Clifford says.\n\nMost banking businesses are about getting deposits through the door.\n\nEuropean banks are trading at half book value or below, he says, and some of them are actually terrific businesses.", "description": "Australian shares are poised to slide; Resource stocks report quarterly results; Hamish Douglass, Andrew Clifford at Morningstar conference; Jobs figures ahead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9934%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6f35440152f842c6338134ccd44503444e3609bb", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
