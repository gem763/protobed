The local coaches working with him didn\u2019t know a lot about the game. Barely anyone noticed that an NBA player was in town.\n\nBasketball wasn\u2019t a big deal in China.\n\nAnd then everything changed very quickly.\n\nThe footprint of the NBA has grown at an extremely rapid pace over the last two decades in China, where more than 500 million people watched games last season and where one new streaming deal alone will pump $1.5 billion into the league\u2019s coffers over the next five years.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came here, I never thought the game in China would get to be this big,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cBut it has. And it\u2019s not going to stop.\u201d\n\nThe possibilities seem endless.\n\nCould there be an NBA team in China despite the travel that would be involved? Might there be two-way player contracts between the NBA and the Chinese Basketball Association? What about the NBA constructing a team to play in China or the Chinese sending a team for a full season in the U.S.?\n\nFarfetched as all that may sound, keep in mind that 20 years ago no one envisioned the NBA-China relationship to be this big - or that it would keep growing after Yao Ming\u2019s run with the Houston Rockets ended eight years ago. The NBA has academies in China now, and the Chinese national team returned to the NBA Summer League in Las Vegas this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good question,\u201d Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cI think the next step will probably come when the next Yao Ming comes. That would take it to a new level, more Chinese players to reach the NBA and make an impact.\u201d\n\nThe marriage between the NBA and the world\u2019s most populous country is stronger than ever. NBA officials say more than 300 million Chinese people play the game and 40 million are registered to play the 2K video game. Thousands showed up this summer just to watch the sons of Dwyane Wade and LeBron James play exhibitions with the rest of their high school teammates.\n\nA trade war is happening between the U.S. and China, political tensions are escalating between the countries and it could impact the products of the league\u2019s business partners. But the game itself continues to thrive.\n\n\u201cI think sports transcends politics and I hope the NBA can continue to connect fans globally,\u201d Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any reason to think our relationship won\u2019t continue to be positive.\u201d\n\nNothing seems to be able to derail the NBA\u2019s popularity.\n\nThe team that the U.S. sent to the World Cup in China didn\u2019t feature the NBA\u2019s biggest stars, yet drew sellout crowds for each of its first six games. U.S. coach Gregg Popovich was begged for autographs and selfies everywhere he went.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time how big basketball has become in China, of course, but all over the world,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cIt\u2019s an international deal now. There are so many great players in so many countries. It\u2019s not a secret.\u201d\n\nStars like James, Stephen Curry, and James Harden have a trip to China on their annual schedules - and when Wade, the recently retired guard who has a lifetime contract with Chinese shoe company Li-Ning, visited this summer one of his events had to be halted after about 10 minutes because the mall where it was happening was overflowing with people.\n\nDonovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz has been to China twice this summer, once to promote his brand, the second time for the World Cup with USA Basketball. He sees it becoming an annual stop for him, too - and believes there is no ceiling for the game globally.\n\n\u201cMan, I couldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be even bigger and it\u2019s not going to be just China. It\u2019s going to be many more countries. The (relationship) between the NBA and China has been huge since I was a kid and it can only take off from there \u2026 because the passion and love is so strong.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a one-sided relationship; China sees reason to invest in the NBA.\n\nJoe Tsai, the co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, agreed this summer to buy the remaining 51% that he didn\u2019t already own of the Brooklyn Nets and Barclays Center from Mikhail Prokhorov in deals worth about $3.4 billion. In 2016, Lizhang Jiang, a businessman from Shanghai, bought 5% of the Minnesota Timberwolves, a stake he sold earlier this year.\n\nChina also takes immense pride in players like Klay Thompson wearing Chinese brands on the court. (Thompson has a 10-year deal with Chinese shoe company Anta for a reported $80 million.) And China sent its national team to NBA Summer League this past July primarily to get ready for the World Cup, but also for exposure on the NBA stage.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s good for our players and good for the team,\u201d China coach Li Nan said of playing in Las Vegas. \u201cI think it\u2019s good for everyone.\u201d\n\nThe NBA has opened three basketball academies in China and has seen very quick success with academies in Asia and Africa. The international influence on the league was more present this past season than ever.\n\nThe NBA MVP, Giannis Antetokounmpo, is from Greece. The rookie of the year, Luka Doncic, is from Slovenia. The most improved player, Pascal Siakam, is from Cameroon. The defensive player of the year, Rudy Gobert, is from France. The All-NBA center, Nikola Jokic, is from Serbia.\n\n\u201cThis past summer, an NBA Academy prospect from China signed a contract with a National Basketball League team in Australia, becoming the first male NBA Academy prospect from China to sign a contract with a professional team,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \u201cAnd on the women\u2019s side, Han Xu from the New York Liberty, who trained at the NBA Academy in Shandong, China, became the first NBA Academy prospect to be drafted into the NBA or WNBA.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t happened overnight.\n\nFormer Commissioner David Stern struck a deal with Chinese television to show games on tape-delay three decades ago, and once toyed with the idea of some sort of NBA-sponsored or branded league in China. Teams embrace the chance to play the annual preseason games in China because he exposure is worth the jet lag.\n\n\u201cWhen I have 76ers gear on and I walk through Shanghai, walk through Shenzhen, if I had a nickel for every time somebody said \u2018Trust the process\u2019 in perfect English I wouldn\u2019t be standing here working,\u201d Philadelphia 76ers CEO Scott O\u2019Neil said, referencing the team\u2019s motto during its rebuilding phase of recent years. \u201cWe\u2019re very much a part of the fabric of China.\u201d\n\nNone of this seemed possible 20 years ago or so, when Bryant made that first trip. Now fans can\u2019t get enough.\n\n\u201cWhen you come here, you feel it from the fans, their energy, people at the hotel, people just walking around,\u201d Kerr said in China during the World Cup. \u201cEverybody just seems very excited about basketball.\u201d\n\nSame goes for the game\u2019s future in China.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kobe Bryant went to China for the first time in 1998, making the trip to Beijing to help operate an instructional basketball clinic for about a dozen kids.
