'They're not really on Facebook and they think Instagram is a bit boring.'\n\nThe platform will allow videos and streaming content from users.\n\nTalks have been held with corporate publishers which could potentially position Howdoo as an alternative to global streaming services. It will be compatible with Apple, Android and Huawei phones.\n\nThe site is being tested with 6,000 users and is aiming to counter issues which have left users, advertisers and content providers feeling 'exploited'.\n\n'We believe we can become profitable without exploiting those three constituent parts,' added Brierley. 'Users can come on for free and choose whether to share their digital footprint with advertisers.\n\n'We don't try to steal the content from the content creators and the advertisers know the users they get access to have opted in for marketing.'", "description": "Howdoo, which also boasts support from IBM and Hewlett Packard, will position itself as an alternative to Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and others.", "authors": ["Neil Craven For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
