Instead, it celebrates a federal bureaucracy dedicated to halting or slowing down President Trump's agenda.\n\nDuring an interview with the Today Show, Stewart said he interviewed fired FBI Director James Comey and argued the deep state is an important group of people \"dedicated to the constitution.\"\n\n\u201cYou meet these characters in my book and the fact is, in a sense, he\u2019s right. There is a deep state. There is a bureaucracy in our country who has pledged to respect the constitution, respect the rule of law. They do not work for the President, they work for the American people,\" Stewart said. \"And as Comey told me in my book, thank goodness for that because they are protecting the constitution and the people when individuals...they restrain them from crossing the boundaries of all.\"\n\n\"What Trump calls the deep state in the United States is protecting the American people and protecting the Constitution. It\u2019s a positive thing,\" he continued.\n\nSo essentially, Stewart and Comey believe bureacrats are doing important work by ignoring the votes of Americans for President of the United States by \"protecting them,\" from the very people they elected. Contrary to Stewart's statement, they do work for the President and swear an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution. They work for Americans under an elected leader.\n\nGovernment bureaucrats are unelected and unaccountable. They have no business thwarting the agenda of a duly elected President, no matter how valiant they may see their own personal cause -- especially because that \"cause\" usually boils down to a personal political preference.\n\nH/T MRC", "description": ".10/08/2019 20:37:59PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/218/7df0c574-7d73-4fe6-987f-081bef799ab9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
