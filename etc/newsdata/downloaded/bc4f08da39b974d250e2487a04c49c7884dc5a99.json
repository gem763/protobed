If they do not file today, we will put the matter on the unopposed roll on Monday. Can you believe that SA Express runs the risk of being liquidated unopposed on Monday because it does not adhere to the rules of court?\u201d he said.\n\nSA Express spokesperson Mpho Majatladi could not confirm on Friday whether the airline had met the deadline to file the court papers to oppose the application by Mothebe. She referred City Press to a statement issued on September 12 on the matter.\n\nIn it, Majatladi had said: \u201cMothebe Shuttle Services is among the contracts that were identified by a recent forensic investigation as irregular.\n\n\u201cThe investigation also implicated SA Express procurement staff, who were later charged with gross misconduct. The airline has since opened criminal cases against the accused.\n\n\u201cThe contract has also been reported as one of the irregular contracts to the Zondo commission of inquiry. Should Mothebe Shuttle Services proceed with the matter against SA Express, the airline intends to respond appropriately within the legal framework.\u201d\n\nSA Airlink will also take legal action on Monday, after its attempt to reverse a decision to grant SA Express permission to fly to Botswana, Zimbabwe and Angola by the International Air Service Council (IASC) failed.\n\nThe licence to fly the lucrative routes was awarded in September and was hailed as crucial \u201cas it would allow the airline to continue to make steady progress in its quests to achieve long-term commercial sustainability\u201d.\n\nIn correspondence with SA Airlink, the council indicated that it stood by its decision and would oppose the matter.\n\nREAD: South Africans may fork out hundreds of millions more in bailouts as SA Airlink takes on SA Express\n\n\n\nIn the urgent court papers, SA Airlink CEO Rodger Foster said he wanted the court to prevent SA Express from flying the new routes, pending the review of the decision.\n\n\u201cFirst, the decision will result in a further substantial drain on the public resources invested in SA Express,\u201d Foster said. \u201cTo start a new route is a considerable financial undertaking that involves massive sunk costs, substantial working capital and technical capacity ... Therefore, SA Express will be required to incur significant capital and working capital expenditure.\n\n\u201cIt is quite apparent that SA Express does not currently have the capital to do so. If it did, there would be no concern about its status as a going concern, but in his letter, dated September 27 2019 [about the consolidation of SAA, Mango and SA Express], Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula makes it clear that this is a very real concern.\n\n\u201cThus, for SA Express to embark on the new routes will necessitate a further substantial injection of capital, which will result in massive expenditure of more funds. That additional depletion to the fiscus would be over and above the substantial amounts of public funds already advanced to SA Express by way of bailouts, guarantees and the like.\u201d\n\nFoster further argued that the maintenance status of the \u201cageing fleet, together with its financial difficulties, may pose a risk to the safety of the service\u201d.\n\nHe also said that, given the severe challenges the state airline faced, it resulted in passengers being stranded and rebooked on to SA Airlink flights via the booking system it shared with SA Express in terms of an interline agreement in force between SAA, SA Express and SA Airlink.\n\nMajatladi said SA Express would oppose the application, which it viewed as being \u201cintended to stifle and limit competition\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese routes are an important part of the turnaround strategy as regional routes generate higher yields than domestic markets,\u201d she said.\n\nTALK TO US Do you think SA Express should be liquidated if it is unable to be profitable or owes money to creditors?\n\nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword AIRLINE and tell us what you think.
