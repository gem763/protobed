REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nLoss-making Nio is the most prominent among dozens of Chinese electric vehicle startups vying to become the next Tesla Inc. All are hampered by dwindling demand in the world\u2019s largest car market, reduced government subsidies for EVs and nagging concerns over the China-U.S. trade war.\n\nIn an unusual move, Nio cancelled a scheduled earnings conference call on Tuesday. But it rescheduled the call on Wednesday after the company\u2019s shares touched a record low of $1.97.\n\nThe company reported a second-quarter loss of $478.6 million, 25.2% more than its first-quarter loss, after the recall of 4,803 vehicles in June.\n\nNio\u2019s revenues fell 8% to 1.41 billion yuan ($198.40 million) from 1.54 billion yuan in the preceding quarter. Nio sold 3,140 ES8 cars, down from 3,989 in the first quarter. It sold just 413 of its cheaper ES6 model.\n\nNick Wang, Nio Group\u2019s head of finance, said the company\u2019s gross margins \u201cwill still be negative for the rest of the year.\u201d But Chief Financial Officer Tung-June Hsieh said Nio has made \u201csignificant, positive progress\u201d in its latest fund-raising efforts, without providing details.\n\nIn May, Nio signed a pact with a government-backed fund for an investment of about $1.5 billion.\n\nNio also announced a $200 million private placement of convertible notes, split equally between early investor Tencent Holdings and founder Li.\n\nNio had $503.4 million in cash on the balance sheet as of June 30.\n\nCASH BURN\n\nTo help cope with cash burn, Nio is expanding its sales network with smaller showrooms called Nio Spaces, according to Hsieh. Nio Spaces \u201cwill allow us to quickly, cost-effectively and meaningfully increase the number of sale points in the market,\u201d Hsieh said. \u201cBy the end of 2019, we aim to have established around 200 Nio Spaces in over 100 cities across China.\u201d\n\nNio will also encourage more regionally driven promotion, introduce a vehicle subscription programme and push sales to corporate users and fleet operators.\n\nAfter reducing headcount to around 7,800 by the end of the third quarter from over 9,900 in January, Nio plans further headcount reduction by the end of this year through both restructuring and spinning off some business units, Hsieh said.\n\nNationally, sales of new energy vehicles, including EVs, contracted for the second month in a row in August, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.\n\nNio led a pack of EV startups and became the first to get internationally listed. It counts Tencent and investor Hillhouse Capital Management among its shareholders and raised $1 billion last year in an initial public offering that valued it at $6.4 billion.\n\nHowever, bankers have said Chinese EV makers face increasingly tough funding efforts while jostling for attention in a crowded sector.", "description": "Nio Inc, one of China\u2019s high-profile electric car startups, disclosed a fresh money-raising push this week, saying it had issued $200 million (162 million pounds) worth of bonds and was accelerating cost-cutting programs to slow cash burn as the company seeks to attract more investors in a slumping market.", "authors": ["Yilei Sun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433896070&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O225", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
