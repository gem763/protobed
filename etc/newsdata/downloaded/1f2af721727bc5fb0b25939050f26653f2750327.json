We believe in improving them!\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIn a strong indication that she would back the Prime Minister, Labour's Caroline Flint earlier tweeted: \"Labour MPs have secured legally binding protection on workers\u2019 rights, environmental standards & consumer protection & a parliamentary lock on deciding our future partnership.\"\n\nIt is a huge boost for the PM as Ms Flint, who backed Theresa May's deal, is a leading figure in a cross-party group called MPs for a deal, holding particular sway among the Labour MPs among them.\n\nBut Jeremy Corbyn insisted his MPs would \"not be duped\" into supporting the Prime Minister's Brexit deal.\n\nAttacking Mr Johnson's deal as \"worse than the one the House rejected three times\u201d.\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENTARY RECORDING UNIT HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nHe insisted it would \"fire the starting pistol on a race to the bottom on regulations and standards.\"\n\nAdding: \"We simply cannot give the government a blank cheque\".\n\nHe referenced the words of TUC Secretary Frances O'Grady who says it would sell workers \"down the river\".\n\n(Image: PRU/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMr Johnson said Mr Corbyn was \"wrong\" about his claims on environmental and social protection, saying: \"This Government, this country will maintain the very highest standards and we will lead in environmental protection and social protection in Europe and across the world.\"\n\nLib Dem leader Jo Swinson also slammed the deal's weakening of protections.\n\nHe said: \"The Prime Minister's deal removes protections on workers' rights, it puts a border down the Irish Sea and according to the Government's own analysis will damage our economy on a scale greater than the financial crash.\"\n\nAsked by former busines secretary Greg Clark if the protection of worker's rights would be put into law, the Prime Minister promised that it would.\n\nThe Government have said that in future, ministers will make a statement explaining where any new Bills could affect employment rights, and compatibility with EU standards.\n\nAnd the Government will be obliged to report regularly on new EU measures and whether the UK plans to take action to mirror them.\n\nThe move would be subject to a vote by MPs.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBut Labour say it's an \"empty gesture not worth the paper it is printed on\".\n\nSpeaking during the first Saturday sitting of the House of Commons since 1982, the Prime Minister implored MPs: \"Let us come together as democrats to end this debilitating feud.\"\n\nParliament is sitting on a Saturday for the first time since 1982 to approve or reject Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nAt the same time, tens or hundreds of thousands of protesters will descend on Westminster demanding a second referendum \u2013 a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d.\n\nBoris Johnson's Brexit deal explained Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on 17 October 2019 - though it stills need approval from MPs and could face a narrow defeat. The 64-page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to 31 December 2020 and the \u00a339bn divorce bill. But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstop's place would effectively be 'two borders' in a hybrid system: Northern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the 310-mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea - more of this below. Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term. Meanwhile commitments on workers' rights are deprioritised - moved to the non-legally-binding Political Declaration for agreement later.

But it was slammed by Labour\u2019s leadership and the TUC as not worth the paper it\u2019s written on.\n\nBoris Johnson began speaking in the Commons at 9.30am with the final vote expected this afternoon.\n\nIf the motion fails or lapses he must request a delay to the October 31 deadline by 11pm tonight.", "description": "The Prime Minister is desperately trying to convince MPs that the deal does not herald a downgrade for workers' rights", "authors": ["Nicola Bartlett", "Image", "Pa", "Uk Parliamentary Recording Unit Handout Epa-Efe Rex", "Pru Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20652714.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
