Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nDo you love meat? Then you should be eating a lot less of it. That was the idea put forth by British chef Heston Blumenthal in Singapore on Thursday (Sept 19).\n\nThe British chef proprietor behind The Fat Duck, considered one of the best restaurants in the world, said it was important for people to think about how they are eating their food and their relationship to it.\n\n\u201cIf we value meat, if we truly value meat, we will consume humongously less quantities of meat,\u201d he said at the panel on Reshaping Food Systems for Sustainability during the Milken Institute Asia Summit jointly held at the Four Seasons Hotel and Hilton Hotel.\n\n\u201cThe question is: did we cultivate meat or did meat cultivate us?\u201d he added.\n\nThe idea, he says, is that if we are more mindful of the food we eat, we will value it so much more so that our relationship with it improves. To be mindful, he says, is to think about where each ingredient comes from and how it was made. This, in turn, leads to better food production and consumption.\n\n\u201cWe need to eat to be fulfilled, and not to be full. We need to eat less, and think about eating more,\u201d he said, adding that it was not about eating more quantities of food.\n\nWhen asked what he saw for the future of food, the 53-year-old had two words: quantum harmonics.\n\nMore specifically (and in simpler terms), Blumenthal believes that the frequencies in sound can be used to treat and change the structure of what is essential to all living things \u2013 water. By changing the structure of water, the world can also change the entire food system, starting from the soil on which plants are grown.\n\nThis is not new for the chef who\u2019s known for his molecular gastronomy.\n\nBlumenthal has said in previous interviews that he had set up a laboratory to study how water can be changed by sound. In one of these interviews with The Business Times published just two months ago, Blumenthal said he would \u201cplay around with water in different infusions, activating it and looking at whether we can taste the difference\u201d.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - \"If we value meat, if we truly value meat, we will consume humongously less quantities of meat,\" he said..
