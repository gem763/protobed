In addition, tariffs on $300 billion worth of other goods would increase from 10 percent to 15 percent as originally planned starting on Sept. 1.\n\nTrump said in announcing the tariff hikes that he'd done so because \"in the spirit of achieving Fair Trade, we must Balance this very unfair Trading Relationship\" with China, which he said had become a \"great burden\" to taxpayers.\n\nIt was unclear exactly what Trump meant with his directive to the U.S. companies or whether he plans additional action to execute the order, but the tweets captured the president's frustration as his escalating trade war with China weighs on the economy and heightens the risk of a recession during an election year.\n\n\"Our Country has lost, stupidly, Trillions of Dollars with China over many years. They have stolen our Intellectual Property at a rate of Hundreds of Billions of Dollars a year, & they want to continue,\" Trump wrote. \"I won\u2019t let that happen! We don\u2019t need China and, frankly, would be far better off without them.\"\n\nHe continued, \"The vast amounts of money made and stolen by China from the United States, year after year, for decades, will and must STOP. Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing your companies HOME and making your products in the USA. I will be responding to China\u2019s Tariffs this afternoon. This is a GREAT opportunity for the United States.\"\n\nInvestors had been in a relatively forgiving mood after China\u2018s tariffs and the Fed speech on Friday. But Trump\u2019s tweets triggered a sharp sell-off in the stock market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 600 points and the S&P 500 tumbling about 2.6 percent by the end of trading. The president\u2019s own tariff escalation came an hour after regular trading closed for the week.\n\nTrump\u2019s initial tweets took the president\u2019s aides by surprise, triggering the latest instance of the White House making policy on the fly after Trump issued a directive via Twitter. Trump huddled midday with his economic team including trade adviser Peter Navarro, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was on vacation and called into the meeting by phone, according to a senior administration official.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201908/989/1155968404_6076227192001_6076220465001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nThe president seems unlikely to back away from the trade stand-off with China anytime soon, close White House allies and current and former administration officials said.\n\nDuring a two-hour meeting in the Oval Office on Monday with several top aides and Cabinet members, Trump repeatedly told attendees \u201cI just want a fair deal\u201d when it comes to China. The meeting included discussion of both China and trade, among other topics, ahead of this weekend\u2019s G7 summit.\n\n\u201cThe president is optimistic and confident that the U.S. has the benefit and the upper hand with China,\u201d insisted one former senior administration official. \u201cI do not think he will back down.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former White House aides viewed China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on Friday \u2014 and Trump\u2019s Twitter response to them \u2014 as both countries angling for dominance ahead of the G7.\n\nChina earlier Friday announced a fresh round of tariffs on $75 billion in U.S. goods ranging from 5 percent to 10 percent. They will go into effect in waves beginning Sept. 1 and Dec. 15, Beijing said.\n\nChina\u2019s state-run news agency Xinhua on Friday quoted the country\u2019s tariff commission, which said the penalties were in response to levies threatened by the U.S. on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. measures have led to the continuous escalation of China-U.S. economic and trade frictions, which have greatly harmed the interests of China, the U.S. and other countries, and have also seriously threatened the multilateral trading system and the principle of free trade,\u201d Beijing said.\n\nThe announcement from China came just before a speech from Powell in which he said the central bank stands ready to do what is necessary to support the record-long U.S. economic expansion. But he did not signal that significant interest rate cuts will be coming soon, angering Trump.\n\n\"As usual, the Fed did NOTHING! It is incredible that they can 'speak' without knowing or asking what I am doing, which will be announced shortly. We have a very strong dollar and a very weak Fed. I will work 'brilliantly' with both, and the U.S. will do great,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nHe then launched a personal attack on Powell, writing, \"My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?\"\n\nAmong the other options Trump was weighing for hitting back against Beijing was reversing a special waiver granted this week that gave U.S. companies three more months to conduct a limited amount of business with blacklisted Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, said a person close to the deliberations. The president made no mention of taking action with regard to Huawei in his Friday evening tweets.\n\nTrump\u2019s outrage at China\u2019s retaliation was largely driven by his perception that the Chinese economy is on the brink of ruin and Beijing would be reluctant to make a move that would further put it in jeopardy, the person said.\n\n\u201cIt was a great surprise to Trump,\u201d the person said of China\u2019s announcement that it would retaliate.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed in recent days that U.S. tariffs were causing China to hemorrhage jobs, up to 2.5 million \u201cin a very short period of time,\u201d and has cited other numbers.\n\n\u201cThey had the worst year in 27 years, but I think it was actually 52 or 54 years. It was the worst year they've had in a half a century. And that's because of me,\u201d Trump told reporters Wednesday.\n\nThe person close to the talks said Trump\u2019s view has been largely informed by Navarro, who has advocated a complete decoupling between the U.S. and Chinese economies. Trump on Friday echoed that sentiment by telling U.S. companies to leave China.\n\nOther aides have cautioned Trump not to discount China\u2019s ability to weather economic pain and its willingness to retaliate against the additional tariffs he announced on Aug. 1, the person said.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariff escalation will leave U.S. companies even more uncertain about purchasing, investments and day-to-day business, business groups said.\n\nA trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell down by more than 600 points after President Donald Trump tweeted. | Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt's impossible for businesses to plan for the future in this type of environment,\u201d said David French, the National Retail Federation\u2019s senior vice president for government relations. \u201cWhere does this end?\u201d\n\nThe Retail Industry Leaders Association warned Trump to end the trade war before any damage becomes irreversible. \u201cIf uncertainty spreads from Wall Street to Main Street, the record expansion we\u2019re enjoying will undoubtedly come to an end and it will be the American consumer, not China, who will suffer,\u201d said Brian Dodge, the group\u2019s chief operating officer.\n\nThe tariff escalation to 30 percent will increase import costs for a list that includes hundreds of intermediate goods, such as machinery and chemicals, used by U.S. manufacturers. Goods that will see a 15 percent tariff \u2014 an increase from the initial 10 percent rate \u2014 include a wide array of consumer goods including clothes, smartphones, computers and other electronics.\n\nThe latest move by Trump could make a possible deal between the U.S. and China even more remote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to step back from the brink once you\u2019ve gone this far, but you\u2019re not going to get a deal under these circumstances,\u201d said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council.\n\n\u201cSo your choices are either you step backwards and admit failure, or you keep charging ahead further into more danger,\u201d he added. \u201cUnfortunately, he seems to be heading forward into more danger.\u201d\n\nAmerican farmers have felt the brunt of the trade war for the last year and the latest escalation has them bracing for more pain.\n\n\u201cReal people \u2014 Chinese citizens, the American public, and our soybean farmers \u2014 are the ones feeling the effects of this trade war,\u201d said Davie Stephens, a soybean farmer from Clinton, Ky., who serves as president of the American Soybean Association.\n\nStephens also lamented that the escalation of tariffs will mean tough conditions will persist for a long time. \u201cThe longevity of this situation means worsening circumstances for soy growers who still have unsold product from this past season and new crops in the ground this season \u2014 with prospects narrowing even more now for sales with China,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has increasingly cited the need to realign U.S. agriculture away from China. But that\u2019s a tall order given the sheer size of the country, its increasing demand for protein and the many years U.S. producers spent in cultivating the market.\n\nPork exporters are particularly feeling frustrated by the fact that they cannot take advantage of the lucrative Chinese market. Imports from the United States already face 62 percent duties and will soon have 10 percent more added. (Still, 2019 so far has been better for the pork industry than last year because African swine fever has devastated pig herds in China, forcing China to import more.)\n\n\u201cU.S. pork producers are eager to compete on a level playing field in China and to more fully participate in this unprecedented opportunity,\u201d the National Pork Producers Council said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, the current trade dispute prevents us from doing so.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. companies in China say they aren\u2019t going anywhere despite Trump\u2019s latest Twitter order and the ongoing challenges of operating in that market.\n\n\u201cChina will contribute a significant proportion of global growth in the decades ahead,\u201d said Jake Parker, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council. \u201cMissing out on that opportunity would weaken the competitiveness of U.S. industry and harm the United States national interests at home.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the leading lobbying group for U.S. businesses, sought to lower the temperature. \u201cU.S. companies have been ambassadors for positive changes to the Chinese economy that continue to benefit both our people,\u201c said Myron Brilliant, the Chamber's executive vice president and head of international affairs. \u201cWe do not want to see a further deterioration of U.S.-China relations. We urge the administration and the government of China to return to the negotiating table.\u201c\n\nEarlier on Friday, Navarro, who provides a strong protectionist voice on U.S. trade talks within the Trump administration, denied that China's announcement caught the White House off guard and downplayed the impact of the move.\n\n\u201cThis was a move that was well-signaled,\u201d Navarro said on CNN. \u201cIt's breaking news, I guess, but it was well-anticipated.\u201d\n\nThe latest front in the tariff battle between China and the U.S. comes as fears grow about a recession. Trump has tweeted relentlessly about the issue in recent days, pinning blame on Powell while he heralded what he says is a booming economy that he's accused the news media of trying to tank to hurt his reelection prospects.\n\nThough he conceded the economy was slowing, Navarro blamed the Fed for slow-walking rate cuts, calling economic worries \"a pure Federal Reserve effect on higher interest rates.\"\n\nNavarro was pressed on some business leaders\u2019 admissions that the uncertainty due to the trade war was dampening investment, but he again blamed monetary policy emanating from the Fed.\n\n\u201cThey can't make investments because the Fed raised interest rates too far, too fast,\u201d he argued. \u201cIf you raise interest rates, you cut down investment and you cut down exports.\u201d\n\nBut business groups contradicted Navarro, expressing a clear annoyance with the constant threats.\n\n\"It's impossible for businesses to plan for the future in this type of environment,\" said David French, senior vice president of the National Retail Federation, after Trump announced his retaliation. \"The administration's approach clearly isn't working, and the answer isn't more taxes on American businesses and consumers. Where does this end?\"\n\nAhead of Powell's speech, both Navarro and Trump appeared confident in what the Fed chief would say, sentiments that apparently evaporated immediately after the Fed chairman\u2019s remarks at a Kansas City Fed conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo.\n\n\"Now the Fed can show their stuff!\" Trump said about an hour before the speech.\n\nNavarro also talked up Powell's remarks, framing them as a potential counterweight to the tariff news.\n\n\"What's important today \u2014 look, this is a big day, tomorrow is a big day. It's a big day today because we're going to get better signals from the federal reserve as to whether they're going to get in line with over 30 central banks around the world that have been cutting rates,\" he said, adding later that forecasting aggressive rate cuts should show \"he's got America's back.\"\n\nThe central bank and Powell have become favorite punching bags of Trump as ominous economic signs have emerged ahead of next year\u2019s election. But Navarro, unprompted at the top of the CNN interview, said there's \"no anxiety in the White House about the economy.\u201d\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

We look at the chessboard and we see basically a strong Trump economy growing at 2 percent because of tax cuts, deregulation, cheap energy and trade,\" he said.\n\nWhile China\u2018s latest latest retaliatory tariffs seem to have especially provoked Trump's fury, they represent \u201ca mild, proportionate response,\u201d to the U.S. decision earlier this month to move forward with more duties, said Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at The Economist Intelligence unit.\n\n\u201cThe recent rise in nationalist, patriotic behavior in China means that it would have been impossible for the Chinese government not to react to the latest U.S. tariffs,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, tariffs of 5 percent to 10 percent on $75 billion worth of imports \u201cis not even a rounding error in estimating the impact on the U.S. economy,\u201d added Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute who has advised the Trump administration.\n\nBut the move is more of a \u201ctoken action\u201d that signals that Beijing doesn\u2019t see ongoing trade talks between the two countries going anywhere, he said.\n\nThe two sides have for more than a year been engaged in talks discussing systemic issues like China\u2019s handling of U.S. intellectual property and other market access and trade issues, including its purchases of American farm goods.\n\nIn his later tweets, Trump also singled out shipping companies, writing, \"Also, I am ordering all carriers, including Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS and the Post Office, to SEARCH FOR & REFUSE, all deliveries of Fentanyl from China (or anywhere else!). Fentanyl kills 100,000 Americans a year. President Xi said this would stop - it didn\u2019t. Our Economy, because of our gains in the last 2 1/2 years, is MUCH larger than that of China. We will keep it that way!\"\n\nTrump and his aides have been mostly unyielding in his complaints that Powell and the Fed are to blame for any economic sluggishness, but Powell on Friday singled out the erratic trade directives coming from the White House.\n\nPowell vowed that the central bank will \u201cact as appropriate\u201d to sustain a record-breaking, decade-long stretch of economic growth following the 2008 financial crisis. But he steered away from providing specifics, calling uncertainty stemming from Trump\u2019s trade policies one of the major factors he was keeping an eye on.\n\nHe also cited other geopolitical events like the growing possibility of a hard Brexit, rising tensions in Hong Kong and the dissolution of the Italian government, saying \u201clong term bond rates around the world have moved down sharply to near post-crisis lows.\u201c\n\nBut the Fed chief emphasized the novelty of the current trade environment, telling the audience that \u201cfitting trade policy uncertainty into this framework is a new challenge. There are \u2026 no recent precedents to guide any policy response to the current situation.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cwhile monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade. We can, however, try to look through what may be passing events, focus on how trade developments are affecting the outlook, and adjust policy to promote our objectives.\u201d\n\nMegan Cassella, Liz Crampton and Ryan McCrimmon contributed to this report.", "description": "The tweets captured the president's frustration as his escalating trade war with China heightens the risk of a recession in an election year.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko", "Nancy Cook", "Adam Behsudi"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2d/c0/fa89cf954221ae0de4930a722ab5/190823-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg"}
