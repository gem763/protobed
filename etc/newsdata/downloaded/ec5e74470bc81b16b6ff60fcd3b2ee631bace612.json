Look, I didn\u2019t think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan. But it\u2019s also the case that a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we\u2019re seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS. Meanwhile soldiers in the field are reporting that for the first time they feel ashamed\u2014 ashamed of what their country has done.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there. And it is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away the honor of our soldiers, you ever might as well go after their body armor next. This president has betrayed American values, our credible has been tattered.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "During Tuesday's CNN-New York Times\u00a0Democratic debate, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate South Bend, IN Mayor Pete Buttigieg said President Donald | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Buttigieg-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
