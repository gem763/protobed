While around 28 per cent of Hispanics supported Mr Trump in 2016, a similar percentage who voted for Republican candidate Mitt Romney in 2012, there are indications support for him has slipped as a result of his often racist rhetoric over immigrants. Hispanics, along with many members of the general public, have also voiced outrage over his administration\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their families at the border.\n\nA poll taken this summer, at the time when Mr Trump was at the centre of controversy after telling four congresswoman of colour to \u201cgo back home\u201d, found support for the president amid Latinos fell 16 points to just 23 per cent.\n\nAt the same time, repeated polls shown that on the issue of a the border all Mr Trump has repeatedly promised to build, there is little support for the project among the country\u2019s Hispanic community.\n\nA Pew survey taken last year showed that while 56 per cent of the public opposed Mr Trump\u2019s idea, as many as 75 per cent of Hispanics were against it. At the same time, 83 per cent said they supported a permanent amnesty for migrants who were brought to the country without papers by their parents \u2013 the so-called Dreamers.\n\nAfter Mr Trump spoke in January from the Oval Office in support of a border wall, Hispanic Federation president Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n, said that \u201cthe only crisis at the border today is the humanitarian crisis the president has created through his crusade to harm, punish and tear apart immigrant families and communities\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cIndeed, we have seen first-hand the impact of the president\u2019s actions: families being denied refuge from violence, sons and daughters being separated from their parents, immigrants enduring physical abuse at the hands of law enforcement officials, and migrant children as young as seven dying from dehydration and exhaustion while in US Border Patrol custody.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Reports say he will spend the night in the Albuquerque area, then travel to California for a series of fundraising events on Tuesday in Palo Alto and Beverly Hills. The president will then will attend other fundraisers in Los Angeles and San Diego on Wednesday before returning to the capital.\n\nWhile Democrats were able to win New Mexico without Ms Clinton even bothering to visit the state in 2016, the Trump campaign is seeking any opportunities to put more states in play in what is likely to be a difficult re-election battle for the president.\n\nHis campaign said a rally earlier this year in nearby nearby El Paso, Texas, was well attended by female and Hispanic voters, and people who had travelled from New Mexico. Hundreds of people showed up early Monday to claim a place in line ahead of the evening event in Rio Rancho. Protesters, for their part, vowed to step up acts of civil disobedience and demonstrations.\n\n\u201cWe have the opportunity because of our fundraising and infrastructure to not only defend the states we carried in 2016, but to extend the map in 2020,\u201d said Rick Gorka, a spokesman for a fundraising committee for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\nMr Gorka said New Mexico was a big part of that strategy, as were Minnesota, New Hampshire and Nevada.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Donald Trump has falsely told supporters in New Mexico that Latinos\u00a0support his demand for a wall on the southern US border.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/16/22/trumphispanic-wall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
