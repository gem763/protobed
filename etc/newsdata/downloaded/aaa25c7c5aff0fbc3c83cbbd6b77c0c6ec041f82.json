While you may think your online identity will go to the grave with you, that\u2019s not always how it works out. Without setting your account to self-implode or handing your login details to a trusted person, companies like Facebook and Google will carry on storing your data and everything else they\u2019ve got on you.\n\nFacebook gives you multiple options for what you can do with your profile once you die. One thing you can do is select someone from your friends list to manage your account once you die. Another thing you can do is set a switch to automatically delete your account \u2014 but Facebook doesn\u2019t exactly know when you\u2019ve died, so let us explain:\n\nHow to automatically delete your Facebook account once you die\n\nAlthough it seems that Facebook knows everything about us by now, it doesn\u2019t know when you\u2019ve died \u2014 although I\u2019m sure this will be a Black Mirror episode one day. To have your account deleted, you\u2019ll need someone to prove your death before your online identity on the social networking platform is gone for good.\n\nOn desktop, head to Facebook\u2019s website and click the drop-down arrow at the top right-hand side of your screen. Then, select Settings .\n\nNow, click on the Edit button next to the Memorialization settings tab.\n\nScroll down and click Request that your account be deleted after you pass away . A box will now pop-up asking you to confirm that you want all your posts and other data linked to your account to be deleted once you die.\n\nOnce confirmed, someone will have to contact Facebook proving your death with a death certificate. If you want your family to be able to see your statuses, photos, videos, and any other posts you\u2019ve made, you can undo this by clicking Keep your Facebook account \u2014 note: you can\u2019t undo this feature if you\u2019re already dead.\n\nHow to turn your Facebook account into a memorial page once you die\n\nFacebook allows you to turn your profile into a digital tombstone once you die. It preserves all the posts you\u2019ve uploaded throughout your life on the platform, from photos, videos, and shares.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that dead Facebook users could outnumber the living by 2069, and if you want to be part of this, here\u2019s everything you need to know on how to memorialize your account once you die:\n\nOn desktop, head to Facebook\u2019s site and log in. Once logged in, click on the drop-down arrow at the top right hand-side of your screen and select Settings .\n\nNow, click on the Edit button next to the Memorialization settings tab.\n\nHere you can choose a \u201c legacy contact .\u201d This is someone who will look after your account after you pass away. The person who you choose will be able to manage tribute posts on your page including: deciding who can post and who can see posts, deleting posts, removing tags, request the removal of your account, respond to new friend requests, and update your profile picture and cover photo.\n\n\n\nAdding a legacy contact on Facebook.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that your legacy contact can only manage posts made after you\u2019ve passed away, meaning they won\u2019t be able to see your previous direct messages or post.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve selected your legacy contact, they\u2019ll be notified and will essentially become a\u2026 godparent to your Facebook account?\n\nIt seems that dying online comes with just as much paperwork as dying IRL. So, in this \u201cRIP\u201d series we\u2019ll walk you through how to shut down your most-used accounts for once you die.", "description": "Facebook lets you select someone from your friends list to manage your account once you die or you can automatically have your account deleted.", "authors": ["Cara Curtis"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2F200-calories-1-3.png&signature=2be957c4f053108f4e500d0b8461f7d9", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
