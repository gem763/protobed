He tackled his biggest project yet on Saturday. Wearing hazmat suits, he and a group of 200 volunteers spent nine hours removing 50 tons of garbage from an L.A. homeless camp. The photographs show a remarkable transformation.\n\nIn the video below, Presler shows what the camp looked like before they went to work.\n\nNine hours later, the results speak for themselves.\n\nThis is one of the proudest moments of my life. I\u2019ll never forget the day we cleaned up a homeless camp in LA. #LosAngelesCleanup pic.twitter.com/jTetowuLAu \u2014 #ThePersistence (@ScottPresler) September 21, 2019\n\nImagine if the left spent less time crusading for the rights of migrants crossing into the U.S. illegally and more time solving the problems of American citizens requiring assistance.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard. Presler shows us what it takes. Why have the leaders of these largely Democrat controlled cities ignored the problem for so long and allowed conditions to deteriorate to such hazardous levels? There are common sense solutions to these problems if liberals would stop crying about conditions at the border and act.\n\nAs Presler says, #StopTalkingStartDoing.\n\nThe federal govt has to step in here. Closed military bases could be used for temporary housing, drug rehab and mental health counseling\u2014we should spend our money on Americans in need FIRST. https://t.co/UO04uYWrRY \u2014 Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) September 21, 2019\n\nPresley told reporters, \u201cThe highlight of the day was when a homeless woman said to me, \u2018Thank you for keeping your promise.\u2019\u201d\n\nHis next project will be a third cleanup in Baltimore scheduled for October 5th.", "description": "Astonishing Transformation: Scott Pressler\u2019s Group Cleaned Up L.A.
