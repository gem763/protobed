In his resignation letter, Byrne said his departure was \u201cfor the good of the firm.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShares of Overstock are plummeting after the CEO says he aided in \u2018Russian investigation\u2019\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Overstock shares were \u201cartificially inflated\u201d because of the company\u2019s plan to pay its next dividend, scheduled in the fall, via a company-issued cryptocurrency that could not be resold for at least six months. That plan, the lawsuit alleges, was designed to punish short-sellers who bet against the company. What ensued, the lawsuit alleges, was a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d that drove up Overstock\u2019s share price nearly 70 percent, from about $16 to $27, over several days.\n\nAD\n\nAs a result, Ha alleges, he and other shareholders paid \u201cartificially inflated prices\u201d for Overstock stock. Ha is seeking a jury trial.\n\nAccording to government filings, Byrne sold 4.7 million shares between Sept. 16 and Sept. 18.\n\nAD\n\nOn Sept. 18, Overstock announced that it was postponing its digital dividend by three to six weeks. That same day, Byrne said in an open letter to former colleagues that he sold his shares after he received a tip \u2014 by text message \u2014 that some brokers were overheard on Sept. 12 and 13 at the Bobby Van\u2019s Steakhouse near Wall Street saying that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was going to \u201cput the kibosh on the dividend.\u201d\n\nOverstock\u2019s former CEO sells off his $90M stake, saying he\u2019s worried about \u2018Deep State\u2019\n\nHe said he had notified Overstock executives in mid-August of his intention to sell his stake in September. \u201cNow I was in a quandary,\u201d he wrote on his blog. \u201cMy decision was made and instructions given three weeks earlier. But now I had also heard a rumor that the SEC was leaking something. What were my duties to the marketplace? Legally, I had none, I think, but it seemed ethically problematic. Do I have inside information if I hear the SEC is leaking something? Or does the fact that the SEC is leaking it make it not inside information?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLess than a week later, on Sept. 23, Overstock disclosed that its chief financial officer, Greg Iverson, had departed the company on Sept. 17. It also lowered its earnings forecast for the year, citing \u201csignificantly\u201d higher costs related to tariffs, insurance and freight shipping. Plus, the company said, customer demand for its retail goods was waning.\n\nAD\n\nThe company\u2019s shares fell more than 18 percent that day. Byrne\u2019s 4.7 million shares \u2014 which he sold for between $16.32 and $21.84, for a total of $91.8 million \u2014 would have been worth $52.8 million at Sept. 23\u2019s closing price of $11.23.\n\nByrne and Iverson did not respond to requests seeking comment. A spokesman for Overstock said \u201cthe company disagrees\u201d with the allegations. \u201cWe will vigorously defend the lawsuit and we expect to win,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nAD\n\nInside Overstock.com, where a firebrand CEO and \u2018Deep State\u2019 intrigue took center stage\n\nA spokeswoman for the SEC declined to comment.\n\nOverstock\u2019s trading platform for digital currencies, tZero, has been the subject of a years-long SEC investigation. (In August, Byrne joked on a call with investors that Overstock should give investigators \u201can office within tZero. They have spent so much of the last two years, three years there.\u201d)\n\nOverstock, which is based near Salt Lake City, got its start in 1999 selling excess inventory, such as bedsheets, exercise machines and Star Wars figurines. The company grew rapidly during the dot-com bust, as it sold off excess merchandise from struggling websites. In recent years, though, Byrne shifted his focus to the company\u2019s growing blockchain business.\n\nAD", "description": "The class-action complaint accuses the retailer and two former executives of trying to \u201cdeceive the market\u201d in order to inflate its stock price.", "authors": ["Abha Bhattarai", "Reporter Covering The Retail Industry"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/seY0A6ReRWmc8kkO7bVKz7FX5p0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RHL3UGWFAUI6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
