And she was surprised to find that she was not alone in her teetotalism.\n\n\u201cIt was more common than I thought it would be,\u201d she revealed on Mornings with Stephen Jardine.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be really hard and there would be lots of pressure especially around certain traditions in St Andrews like Raisin Weekend. But a lot of friends I ended up making didn\u2019t drink and people really respect you for having principles and reasoning behind why you don\u2019t drink.\u201d\n\nBrooke and her friends are just some of many young people choosing to remain sober. Recent research discovered a decline in drinking among under 25s, compared with a decade ago.\n\nTom Hyde runs a caf\u00e9 in Edinburgh where he\u2019s seen first-hand the shift away from alcohol-fuelled nights out, as customers look for a different experience.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the last 2-3 years in particular is rising demand towards the end of the day for an additional space for people to come,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe do serve alcohol but what we find most of our customers are wanting is non-alcoholic drinks during that period as an alternative to bars and pubs.\u201d\n\nSo as students arrive at university to begin their studies there may be more friendships cemented over non-alcoholic beverages than Fresher\u2019s Week has ever witnessed before.", "description": "The number of sober young people is rising, and student union bars are under threat.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07l6620.jpg"}
