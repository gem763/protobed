Bizarrely, the popular cryptocurrency\u2019s summer spike and recent downward trend have closely resembled the fortunes of Mexican avocados. A spooky coincidence? Not everyone is so sure. And the price of the fruit has plummeted this month.\n\nEagle-eyed Bloomberg analyst Tracy Alloway sounded the Avocado Alarm early today on Twitter. She joked that it was the avocados that forewarned her of Bitcoin\u2019s drop to its lowest level since last June.\n\n*BITCOIN DROPS TO LOWEST LEVEL SINCE JUNE The avocados told me this would happen. pic.twitter.com/5rOyE3Ohak \u2014 Tracy Alloway (@tracyalloway) October 24, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, almost as if to escape her absurd but hugely popular avocado analogy, Bitcoin has since bounced back an astonishing 12 points. And, as Alloway\u2019s chart shows, while the price of bitcoin has mirrored avocados between February and September, the fruit has experienced a much sharper decline following its boom in the last quarter of 2019.\n\nAvocado and crypto watchers have worked hard\u2014if not entirely seriously\u2014to suggest possible reasons for the uncanny price similarities. One of them is that millennials\u2014lovers of both avocado toast and Bitcoin\u2014pushed up the price during the summer, and they\u2019ve since got bored of both.\n\nBut that\u2019s almost as strained as the avocado metaphor in one of the dumbest crypto Twitter spats ever\u2014between Tron\u2019s Justin Sun and Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin.\n\nLooking deeper into the fortunes of Mexico\u2019s avocado trade, analysts put the blame for the slump at the door of U.S. President Trump, who in June announced new import tariffs against Mexico to counter immigration.\n\nThe U.S. purchases around 75% of Mexico\u2019s avocado crop. A 5% increase in import tariffs, rising 5% each month to reach a maximum of 25% on October 1st, means a big hit for the $2.4 billion-a-year market.\n\nTrump also took aim at Bitcoin only a month later. While the market bounced back, it proved only a temporary rally.\n\nTo compound matters for the avocado trade, Mexico\u2019s \u201cgreen gold\u201d has attracted the attention of violent cartels, who were quick to see the potential in the cash crop. As a result, the U.S., has recently issued a warning that it could also withdraw dozens of avocado orchard inspectors, who are stationed in Mexico, sending further shivers through the export industry.\n\nWill the fact that the cartels are now threatening Mexico\u2019s avocado market finally put an end to the odd correlation with Bitcoin?\n\nNobody knows. But if the bitcoin-avocado pair does stay relatively constant, millennials may breathe a sigh of relief.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The cryptocurrency\u2019s strong correlation with avocados could spell trouble.
