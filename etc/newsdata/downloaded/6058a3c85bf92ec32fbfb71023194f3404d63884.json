Municipalities meeting last week.\n\nAckerman put forward a motion at the meeting calling on the association to \u201crecognize the value of B.C.\u2019s resource sector\u201d even as it is moving toward a lower carbon economy. The motion passed, albeit with a few amendments that recognized the need to support workers.\n\nSurprisingly, her motion also included a preamble that was critical of plans by other municipalities to sue oil companies, describing such a move as \u201cnot an appropriate direction for B.C. municipalities.\u201d\n\nAt the UBCM, preambles to motions are not adopted as policy. But Ackerman\u2019s preamble stands in stark contrast to the next two motions put forth at the association\u2019s meeting that sought to pressure the B.C. provincial government to support municipalities suing oil companies. Neither of those motions were adopted.\n\nThe City of Victoria withdrew its motion calling on the UBCM to \u201cexplore the initiation of a class action lawsuit on behalf of member local governments to recover costs arising from climate change from major fossil fuel corporations.\u201d\n\nA similar motion from the City of Port Moody, a bedroom community outside Vancouver, was rejected. It had called upon the B.C. government \u201cto enact legislation that holds fossil fuel companies financially liable for climate-related harms by their contributions to climate change.\u201d\n\nLegislation would help expedite litigation against global fossil fuel companies but legislation is not necessary Ben Isitt, Victoria city councillor\n\nVictoria city councillor Ben Isitt said that motion was defeated because of the division between major cities in south-eastern B.C. and smaller municipalities in the interior of the province. He said there are 162 municipalities in the province and 75 per cent of the population lives in just 10 per cent of those municipalities.\n\nDespite the motion being voted down, he said some municipalities are still looking to sue oil companies.\n\n\u201cLegislation would help expedite litigation against global fossil fuel companies but legislation is not necessary,\u201d Isitt said.\n\nHe added that Victoria withdrew its motion because the \u201cfirst step\u201d in the process is doing \u201ca proper and rigorous analysis\u201d of a potential case against the oil companies and added that law firm Arvay Finlay LLP is working an the analysis.\n\nVancouver-based Arvay Finlay recently represented the province in its case before the B.C. Supreme Court on whether it could restrict shipments of bitumen or other heavy oil products from Alberta. The B.C. Court of Appeal issued a unanimous ruling in May that the province could not.\n\nThe city has also been advised by its own lawyers on whether such a case could be pursued, but neither Isitt nor a city spokesperson would comment on the legal opinion. \u201cI can\u2019t disclose privileged legal advice from the city\u2019s own lawyers,\u201d Isitt said.\n\nWe don\u2019t have the option of not putting pressure on higher levels of government to \u2026 limit the amount of climate change we\u2019re going to be experiencing Rob Vagramov, mayor of Port Moody\n\nIsitt said the adoption of the motion from Fort St. John and the withdrawal/rejection of the motions on climate litigation is not a sign that cities and towns in the province are moving to support the oil and gas industry.\n\nFor evidence, he pointed to numerous other motions adopted at the UBCM on climate change issues, including a motion that was adopted calling for an end to fossil fuel subsidies.\n\nRob Vagramov, mayor of Port Moody, said his community is still interested in putting pressure on the B.C. government to support climate litigation and other methods to reduce emissions and help B.C. communities cope with a changing climate.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the option of not putting pressure on higher levels of government to do everything in their power to reduce and to limit the amount of climate change that we\u2019re going to be experiencing,\u201d Vagramov said.\n\nCities and towns have their own culpability in any climate change action, as municipal governments have built and permitted infrastructure \u2014 like roads, boat jetties and airports \u2014 that enable the combustion of hydrocarbons in increasing quantities, said Stewart Muir, executive director of Resource Works, a group that advocates for natural resource development in B.C. Ackerman is a member of Resource Works\u2019 advisory council.\n\n\u201cI think you see a double standard and it\u2019s present in every municipality,\u201d Muir said of attempts to launch a class action lawsuit against oil companies, adding that 80 per cent of emissions occur at the point of consumption rather than extraction.\n\n\u201cThey should start to sue themselves,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "Vancouver and Victoria have 'completely forgotten' that the province still runs on natural resource extraction and exports, says the mayor of a rural B.C. city", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/victoria.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
