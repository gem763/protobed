Look at their inaction after the 2009 Lakanal House fire [which killed six people in Camberwell, South London].\n\n\u201cRecommendations made after that were not put in place. If they were, Grenfell might not have happened.\n\n\u201cThe inquiry has been conducted in the wrong order. It\u2019s given the real villains extra time to prepare.\u201d\n\nNatasha Elcock, of Grenfell United, called the fire \u201cthe worst night of my life\u201d saying \u201cwe must expose the truth to make sure it never happens again\u201d.\n\nAfter being told to \u2018stay put\u2019 she saved her own and her daughter\u2019s lives by flooding their 11th-floor flat.\n\nMs Elcock said: \u201cI will never forget waiting for hours with my daughter to be rescued. I was one of the lucky ones. I made it out. Many did not.\u201d\n\nWelcoming the finding the tower broke building regulations she called for phase two of the inquiry, which starts in January, to target those responsible.\n\nShe said: \u201cThis turns the spotlight on to the council, the tenant management company and the corporates involved in the refurbishment that turned our homes into a death traps.\n\n\u201cThe inquiry must fearlessly go after the people at these organisations who bear responsibility.\u201d\n\nBehailu Kebede, whose fridge-freezer started the fire, was completely exonerated of blame in the report.\n\nPhase two will analyse factors which led to the blaze and made it so deadly.\n\nIt will also investigate claims the council ignored warnings about fire hazards from residents.\n\nLocals gathered to yesterday to watch a Commons debate on the report in the Bay 20 community centre, in the shadow of the tower.\n\nThey clapped when Boris Johnson was blasted over huge cuts he made to fire services as mayor of London, and when Labour\u2019s David Lammy referred to the disaster as \u201ccorporate manslaughter\u201d.\n\nThe Prime Minister insisted \u201cthe truth will out and justice will be done\u201d.\n\nBut Judy Bolton, from Justice4Grenfell, who lost three friends said she doubted \u201chis sincerity, his integrity and his responsibility to this community.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThere were recommendations after Lakanal House, and they weren\u2019t implemented, so we\u2019re concerned the same will happen.\u201d\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was a \u201cpreventable fire\u201d and that there needed to be a \u201cpolitical response and a procedural response\u201d to ensure justice.\n\nLFB commissioner Dany Cotton insisted her colleagues had faced \u201cimpossible conditions\u201d at Grenfell.\n\nShe said she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d at criticism of individual staff who were \u201cin unprecedented circumstances\u201d", "description": "A report into the tragedy said the building's cladding was the \"principal reason\" the flames spread so quickly", "authors": ["Matthew Young", "Image", "Pa", "Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20760773.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Tower-block-fire-in-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
