The administration has plowed ahead with a range of policies to limit access to asylum, including the \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d initiative, which forces certain non-Mexico asylum seekers to stay in that country while they await rulings on their cases.\n\nThe White House blamed Lafferty, who has led the asylum division for the past six years, for an inability to toughen asylum standards, according to one current DHS official.\n\nMorning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

The credible fear test is the first step in certain asylum claims, and the administration contends it allows people to enter the U.S. even if ultimately they won\u2019t be granted asylum.\n\nA USCIS spokesperson said in a written statement that the agency retains discretion to move senior executives to different roles within the department, but did not comment on Lafferty\u2019s case specifically.\n\n\u201cUSCIS, like other federal entities, has a mobile group of senior executives who qualify for a variety of positions,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cUSCIS has the authority to reassign these high-level managers to best serve the agency.\u201c\n\nBuzzFeed News first tweeted Lafferty\u2019s reassignment. The outlet also reported in July that Lafferty criticized the Trump administration\u2019s chaotic approach to policymaking in an email to staffers.\n\nThe email specifically focused on the implementation of a new ban on asylum seekers who transit through another country en route to the U.S.\n\nNEW: John Lafferty, head of asylum at USCIS, is being reassigned to an agency service center in Virginia, according to a DHS source.\n\n\n\nLafferty made pointed comments in his emails to officers about the big change to asylum policy. It did not go unnoticed. https://t.co/zcgGsqhGG9 \u2014 Hamed Aleaziz (@Haleaziz) September 4, 2019\n\n\"We are once again being asked to adapt and to do so with very little time to train and prepare,\" he wrote. \"If I didn't know that we have some of the most dedicated, most adaptable and most talented public servants presently serving in the federal government I would be concerned about being able to implement these changes on such short notice.\"\n\nA federal judge in San Francisco blocked the third-country asylum ban nationwide in July, but the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals limited the injunction several weeks later to its jurisdiction in California and Arizona. That allowed the policy to be put into place in New Mexico and Texas.\n\nThe email that announced Lafferty\u2019s new role came from Jennifer Higgins, an associate director for refugee and asylum operations.\n\n\u201cJohn has served with distinction as the chief of the asylum division for the past six years and has led the division through some of its most challenging times and a period of unprecedented growth and change,\u201d Higgins wrote. \u201cJohn\u2019s leadership was characterized by a selfless, unwavering, and passionate commitment to those he served \u2014 the applicants, his staff, and the American public.\u201d\n\nIn the new role, Lafferty will help oversee 700 agency staff and 200 contractors processing permanent resident applications and international student work permits, according to the email.\n\nHe will be replaced in an acting capacity by Andrew Davidson, currently the deputy associate director for the agency\u2019s fraud detection and national security directorate.\n\nLafferty did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "The decision comes as President Donald Trump proceeds with a sweeping overhaul of the asylum system.", "authors": ["Ted Hesson"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/06/37/64442da14f48b4df7ced1b3401de/190625-border-pmlede-gty-773.jpg"}
