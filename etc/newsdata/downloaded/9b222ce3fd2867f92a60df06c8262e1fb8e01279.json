(AP) - Cyntoia Brown-Long, now 31 years old, knows as much about life in prison as she does about being free.\n\nAt 16, she was arrested for robbing and killing a man she says picked her up for sex and later was sentenced to life in prison. But two months ago, Brown-Long walked out of a Tennessee prison after successfully petitioning the governor for her clemency.\n\nBrown-Long\u2019s story has mostly been framed by other people - attorneys, the makers of a documentary film and celebrities such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian West and LeBron James, who called for her release. Her case became a hashtag, sparking discussions about child trafficking and juvenile justice reform, and Netflix announced plans to release a documentary about her.\n\nBut now she\u2019s speaking for herself in her memoir, \u201cFree Cyntoia: My Search for Redemption in the American Prison System,\u201d released Tuesday, that goes deep into the patterns of sexual and drug abuse, predatory men and a childhood raised in the juvenile justice system.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kind of tethered to the worst moment of your life. And we\u2019re so much more complex than that as human beings,\u201d Brown-Long told The Associated Press. (She married her husband, Jamie Long, while in prison and now goes by the name of Brown-Long.)\n\nHer birth mother has admitted drinking heavily while she was pregnant, which Brown-Long\u2019s attorneys argued lead to her problems with anger as a young child. Although she was smart and had stability in her adoptive family, she lashed out at other children and teachers.\n\nBy age 13, she was in and out of juvenile facilities, often trying to run away from being held in custody. In her book, she describes a mostly segregated judicial system that punished her when she wouldn\u2019t follow the rules but provided little academic or mental health support.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t recall a time where people at school or people in the court system actually listened to me and (asked) why I felt how I did,\u201d Brown said.\n\nShe ran away to Nashville, where she said another girl taught her how to sell sex for money. She never told the men that she was just 15. Many initial media reports about Brown-Long called her a \u201cteen prostitute.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey think, \u2018Oh well, she made that choice and she was doing what she wanted to do,\u2019\u201d said Brown-Long. \u201cThere still needs to be more work done on coming to an understanding when it comes to domestic minor sex trafficking.\u201d\n\nLife got a lot worse when she met 24-year-old Kutthroat, or Kut for short. Brown-Long writes that she was forced to have sex in exchange for money; if she refused, she was raped, threatened or beaten. Sometimes she and Kut would rob men who came to have sex with her and she was often high, she writes.\n\nBrown-Long said many years later, while she was in prison, she realized what sex trafficking actually looked like and how easy it was for men to prey on her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking these cues from your environment, from your friends, from the world around you that this is what you need to do to be accepted,\u201d Brown-Long said. \u201cYou want a man to want you and you want to do what it takes to be accepted.\u201d\n\nKut became increasingly violent and often threatened her with a gun, she said. In August 2004, he sent her out to get more money, and this is where Brown-Long\u2019s story differs from the prosecutor and detective who handled the case.\n\nJohnny Allen, a 43-year-old real estate agent, picked up Brown-Long at a drive-through and took her home to his house. At Allen\u2019s house, Brown-Long said she began feeling afraid. Allen had shown her rifles he had in the house before they got into bed together.\n\nPolice found Allen nude in bed with a gunshot wound to the back of his head, his hands clasped together near his head as if he were sleeping.\n\nBrown-Long told police Allen suddenly reached under the bed, and she thought he was grabbing a gun. She told police she had brought a gun with her and shot him in self-defense.\n\nMetro Nashville police Detective Charles Robinson, one of the detectives who first interviewed Brown-Long in 2004, said her story \u201cdidn\u2019t jive with what I saw in the crime scene, bottom line. And that\u2019s how I knew she was lying.\u201d\n\nIn the memoir, Brown-Long disputed that she didn\u2019t shoot him to rob him, but evidence showed she took his truck, wallet and guns.\n\n\u201cThe media has never really wanted to look at the facts of the case,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThey just took her word, or her people\u2019s word, for what happened.\u201d\n\nRobinson said Brown-Long never implicated Kut in the murder and there was no evidence to charge him with any crime. Kutthroat was killed a few months after Brown-Long\u2019s arrest. Jeff Burks, the original prosecutor in the case, said Brown-Long now wants to blame Kut as a trafficker who forced her actions.\n\n\u201cI considered her then, and now, that she operated as an independent agent doing what she wanted to do,\u201d said Burks.\n\nBut Burks said he understands why courts and states have been reviewing juvenile sentencing laws. \u201cI don\u2019t oppose it,\u201d Burks said. \u201cI think there are some good ideas out there.\u201d\n\nBrown-Long had a long road to redemption in prison, but she found people and institutions who gave her opportunities to grow and learn from her mistakes. She earned an associate and bachelor\u2019s degree from Lipscomb University while in prison, her adoptive mother became her rock and she found her faith as a Christian.\n\nAt the same time she was asking for clemency, her story caught the attention of high-profile celebrities. \u201cIn terms of clemency, specifically with the governor, my attorneys were actually told that was not helping,\u201d Brown-Long said.\n\nDozens of people wrote letters that said she was reformed, including an assistant attorney general who once argued against her in an appeals court. The Tennessee governor agreed, saying her sentence was too harsh and that she had \u201crebuilt her life.\u201d\n\nAnd for a woman who\u2019d survived abusive relationships, she also opened her heart to love. Her husband, a singer, wrote her when she was in prison. After months of letters and calls, they were married over the phone in January.\n\n\u201cI never thought that I\u2019d be coming out of prison a married woman,\u201d Brown-Long said.\n\nSince her release, she\u2019s been doing community service, meeting with at-risk children and spending time at a transitional center for parolees. She\u2019s in the process of starting a nonprofit organization and wants to advocate for legislation that would change how juveniles are sentenced.\n\n\u201cEveryone is capable of receiving redemption,\u201d Brown-Long said. \u201cGod\u2019s love is available for everyone.\u201d\n\nBrown-Long is now enjoying the simple things of life outside prison, like cooking her own food and texting. But now that she\u2019s a got a platform, she wants to bring attention to juvenile cases like hers.\n\n\u201cI am not by myself,\u201d Brown-Long said. \u201cThey are still facing time and that\u2019s hard to think, \u2018Well, why me?\u2019 And I definitely believe that God has given me an opportunity to show people, to show legislators, to show the public that people can be given a second chance.\u201d\n\n__\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Free-Cyntoia/\n\n___\n\nFollow Kristin M.
