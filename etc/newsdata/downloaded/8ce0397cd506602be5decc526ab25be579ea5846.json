In 1994, he returned to the army to command a brigade and then a division in the occupied West Bank.\n\nAccording to his official army biography, he was Israel's military attache to the United States from 2005 until 2009.\n\nHe was chief of staff from 2011 to 2015, when he retired, and has boasted in video clips of the number of Palestinian militants killed and targets destroyed under his command in the 2014 war with Gaza's Islamist Hamas rulers.\n\nGantz has a BA in history from Tel Aviv University, a master's degree in political science from Haifa University and a master's in national resource management from the National Defense University in the United States.\n\nHe is married and a father of four.\n\nA security hawk, he is determined to keep the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank under Israeli control and maintain Israeli sovereignty over mainly Palestinian east Jerusalem.\n\nThe two main contenders are in step on external threats such as archfoe Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah as well as Hamas.\n\nGantz has pledged to improve public services and show \"zero tolerance\" for corruption -- a reference to graft allegations facing Netanyahu.\n\nRegarding the Palestinians, the Blue and White election manifesto speaks of wanting to separate from them, but does not specifically mention a two-state solution.\n\nGantz is liberal on social issues related to religion and state, favouring the introduction of civil marriage.\n\nAfter gaffes on live television appearances earlier in the campaign, Gantz has been less visible lately, and some say not visible enough.\n\nBut opinion polls show he has maintained support from those seeking to move on from Netanyahu's long tenure in office.", "description": "Benny Gantz, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's main challenger in Tuesday's elections, is a respected former military chief who says he can restore honour to the premier's office.
