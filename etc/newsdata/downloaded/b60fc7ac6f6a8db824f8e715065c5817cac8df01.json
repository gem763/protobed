The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up around 43.9% from its 52-week low price of $160.29/share.\n\nBut are more gains in store for this ETF? Let\u2019s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed:\n\nITA in Focus\n\nThe fund offers exposure to the Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index which measures the performance of the aerospace and defense sector of the U.S. equity market. Boeing (NYSE: ), United Technologies (NYSE: ) and L3harris Technologies are the top three holdings of the fund. It charges 42 basis points in annual fees (see all Industrials ETFs here).\n\nWhy the Move?\n\nRising geopolitical risks and higher commercial demand are giving a boost to defense companies. There was an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest oilfields in Hijra Khurais and the world\u2019s biggest crude processing facility at Abqaiq on Sep 14. Iran is being blamed by the United States for carrying out such devastation.\n\nTalks are doing rounds that a fighting between Iranian and United States forces in the Gulf could be in the cards. On Sunday night, President Donald Trump said \"there is reason to believe\" that the White House knows the identity of the wrongdoer, and that the military is \"locked and loaded\" to take action. This explains the recent run in defense ETFs.\n\nMore Gains Ahead?\n\nCurrently, ITA has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a moderate risk outlook, suggesting that the outperformance could continue in the months ahead.\n\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\n\nZacks\u2019 free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.
