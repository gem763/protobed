Thankfully, no international flights were cancelled because of the unfortunate weather.\n\nDamaging 65kph winds gusting up to 90kph are predicted for much of coastal New South Wales including the Hunter, Sydney and Illawarra coastal areas throughout the rest of the day.\n\nA severe weather warning was issued for these areas on Monday morning as a result of a deep low pressure system over the Tasman Sea, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.\n\nThe #winds that have been driving fires across #NSW will continue through today. They are expected to ease somewhat tomorrow, however there will still be strong gusts through the day. Conditions should improve significantly Wed & Thurs. https://t.co/FmrRRHhZf5 @NSWRFS #nswfires pic.twitter.com/SV9NvJChYp \u2014 Bureau of Meteorology, New South Wales (@BOM_NSW) September 9, 2019\n\nThe wild weather began late last week, with four people injured in Sydney after a tree fell onto the Hume Highway on Friday. But we haven\u2019t seen the worst of it just yet.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Sydney-sider, you might want to stock up on board games and invite your friends over to play monopoly with you because severe wind and hazardous surf conditions are predicted to continue throughout the afternoon and night. Looks like it\u2019s not a great time to be the outdoorsy type.\n\nThe conditions predicted to be at their worst towards the late afternoon and night, so that sounds like a good excuse to yeet yourself out of work at 3.30pm on a Monday.\n\nAlthough the airport is back up to two runways, it\u2019s probably advisable to check with your airline for regular updates throughout the rest of the day because the predicted weather could cause further delays.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-153342179-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
