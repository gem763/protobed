Listen to what he has to say about betting on Week 5. USA TODAY\n\nFRISCO, Texas \u2014 By the time Saints left tackle Terron Armstead saw Robert Quinn, it was too late. The speedy Cowboys pass rusher had burst off the right end on third-and-8 with 7:34 to play in the fourth quarter.\n\nQuinn needed just three seconds on the play clock to wrap up Teddy Bridgewater for his second sack of the night (or third, if you count the one negated by a defensive back\u2019s penalty). Quinn was ecstatic. So the newly minted Dallas rusher celebrated in a fashion befitting of teammates\u2019 nickname for him. Slithering like a snake, his ankles moving in unnatural angles, Quinn embraced the moniker he\u2019s received around Cowboys locker room: the Black Cobra.\n\nTyrone Crawford on Cowboys DE Robert Quinn: \u201cWhen you\u2019re in your ninth year and your ankles are still bending like that, it\u2019s a good thing.\u201dpic.twitter.com/Q2cMf1s9eF \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 4, 2019\n\n\u201cHe can bend like no other and obviously when you\u2019re in your ninth year and your ankles are still bending like that, it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d fellow defensive lineman Tyrone Crawford said Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s the black cobra. And he strikes. He strikes pretty viciously.\u201d\n\nDallas Cowboys defensive end Robert Quinn (58) closes in for a sack on New Orleans Saints quarterback Teddy Bridgewater. (Photo: Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nQuinn\u2019s strike was among the Cowboys\u2019 brightest spots in last week\u2019s loss to the Saints, Dallas\u2019 first loss of the season. In addition to the two sacks, Quinn recorded three quarterback hits and a pass deflection as Dallas held a New Orleans team averaging 24 points to 12. Now facing the Packers on Sunday, the Cowboys will need Quinn to contain Aaron Rodgers in a way they\u2019ve often failed to.\n\nRodgers has won six of nine career games against the Cowboys, throwing 16 touchdowns to two interceptions with an average quarterback rating of 103.6. In 2014 and 2016, it was Rodgers magic that led the Packers to the NFC title game in wins of five and three points respectively. The Cowboys have beat Rodgers just once in their last seven faceoffs: a 30-16 decision at Lambeau Field in October 2016. Then-Cowboys defensive lineman David Irving exploded that game for four tackles, a sack, a pass deflection and three forced fumbles, all in just 19 defensive snaps. It was enough to limit the Pro Bowl quarterback.\n\nThe Cowboys must limit him again to win this week.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really good in the pocket. He\u2019s really good out of the pocket,\u201d head coach Jason Garrett said of Rodgers. \u201cHe\u2019s really good on time. He\u2019s really good when the play breaks down.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that anybody has had real success at stopping him throughout his career.\u201d\n\nStill, the Cowboys hope that the offseason addition of Quinn to their defensive line will help reverse their fortune against Rodgers. Two-time Pro Bowl defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence will anchor the left side of Dallas\u2019 line, while defensive tackles Christian Covington and Maliek Collins play interior. But since Dallas acquired Quinn from Miami in March, he has led the team in sacks (3) and quarterback pressures (11, per coaches film)\u2014despite missing two of the season\u2019s four contests.\n\nJason Garrett on Cowboys DE Robert Quinn (coming from left side of frame here): \u201cIt\u2019s not only flexibility but its balance.\n\n\n\n\u201cThose guys sometimes get in unorthodox positions and boom! They can go make plays.\u201d pic.twitter.com/EvFyMGAs1U \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 4, 2019\n\nCredit his uncanny bend, relentless pursuit on every snap and continued evolution even in season 9 to elevate the attack. Like the green clay character Gumby, owner Jerry Jones said, Quinn\u2019s speed and flexibility enables him to \u201cbend and bend around and bend around a block a little bit,\u201d Jones told Dallas radio station 105.3 The Fan this week. \u201cI think that he's playing like a hair-on-fire player so to speak.\u201d\n\nGarrett described the bend as rare.\n\n\u201cRobert\u2019s ability to bend to come around the corner is exceptional,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cHis ability to bend to change direction is exceptional. We saw that when we played against him a number of times, but then when you see it up close, it\u2019s like, \u2018wow.\u2019 It\u2019s eye-opening.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it very much in my life.\u201d\n\nQuinn has proven he can transfer those skills to disrupt Rodgers: In four career games against Green Bay, he\u2019s hit Rodgers seven times, recording 3.5 sacks and forcing a fumble in the process. The Cowboys will bank on the Black Cobra to continue that trend Sunday. To flash those pass-rush skills that can\u2019t be taught, Crawford said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just natural, man,\u201d Crawford added of Quinn, who like Lawrence hails from South Carolina. \u201cThose South Carolina guys, man. I call them guys aliens. It\u2019s just a place like Area 51.\n\n\u201cThose guys are special, man.\u201d\n\nFollow Jori Epstein of USA TODAY Sports on Twitter @JoriEpstein", "description": "The Dallas Cowboys prepare for Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers with Robert Quinn and his pass rushing skills that are like a cobra.", "authors": ["Jori Epstein", "Published P.M.
