It was late morning, Friday 2 November 2018. The actor and director was giving a talk about the performing arts to university students, and his phone kept flashing. It was so incessant that the students suggested he\u2019d better take a look. He told them it wouldn\u2019t be anything important, turned the phone over and got on with his lecture. When the class broke for lunch, he saw missed calls from Talawa theatre company, where he had been working for the past year, as well as several unknown numbers and messages.\n\nOne text stood out. It was from a journalist at the Sunday Times, asking for a comment on a story the paper was preparing to run about Lennon\u2019s place on a prestigious scheme \u2013 the artistic director leadership programme (ADLP) for black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) theatre practitioners. Lennon had been awarded an 18-month residency with Talawa, Britain\u2019s best-known black-led theatre company. He scrolled down the text.\n\n\u201cIt does seem striking that neither the ADLP nor the Talawa has ever made clear that you are a white man,\u201d the journalist wrote, adding: \u201cWhy has neither Talawa theatre or the ADLP programme made clear that you have received BAME funding as a white man with Irish parents?\u201d Lennon decided not to respond. It was true that his parents were white, but this was no secret; nor was the fact that he believed he had African heritage. He had always been treated by people as mixed race, and so identified as a person of mixed heritage. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I had anything to answer,\u201d he tells me now. We\u2019re sitting in a pub in north London. \u201cTalawa knew about my being of mixed heritage while having white parents. I\u2019ve never not spoken about it.\u201d\n\nTwo days after Lennon received the text, the Sunday Times published its story, accusing Lennon of \u201cpassing\u201d as black. \u201cA theatre director who has won funds meant for \u2018people of colour\u2019 has admitted his parents and grandparents were all white,\u201d ran the introduction, going on to quote one unnamed black actor who had expressed disquiet: \u201cWhen I discovered his background, I thought it was unfair that a white man had taken a black person\u2019s place on a BAME scheme.\u201d The article compared Lennon to Rachel Dolezal, the former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the US, who claimed she was black despite having white parents, and when challenged in 2015, argued that \u201cthe idea of race is a lie\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With his brother Vincent (on left). Photograph: courtesy of Anthony Ekundayo Lennon\n\nLennon was floored. \u201cI call it the hit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really did feel like an assassination \u2013 a character assassination.\u201d But there was more to come. The story was picked up by other journalists, and Lennon was portrayed as a conman who had cheated his way to the top at the expense of people of colour. As a dramatic plot, it appeared to have everything: hubris, nemesis, mistaken identity, even the occasional hint of comedy.\n\nThe Sun suggested that Lennon had chosen to identify as black because he had \u201ccurly hair\u201d and had struggled to find decent parts as an actor. The Daily Mail pointed to the \u00a3406,500 Arts Council grant shared between the four recipients of the ADLP award and suggested that Lennon had cheated the taxpayer. The Mirror said he had won the grant \u201cbecause he believes everyone is African\u201d. It was true that British theatre, like much of the arts world, was, and is, disproportionately white: the Independent published data showing that, in 2016-17, people from BAME backgrounds made up just 8% of chief executives, 10% of artistic directors and 10% of theatre chairs; Lennon\u2019s award, it argued, was \u201ca kick in the teeth\u201d for practitioners of colour. Trevor Phillips, former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, told the Telegraph: \u201cWe should be doing more to help individuals of talent from black and ethnic minority communities, and we cannot do that if the few opportunities that exist are going to white people who are self-identifying as something else.\u201d\n\nApart from the friends and colleagues closest to him (both Talawa and the Arts Council stood by Lennon, arguing that they had never been misled), he found himself damned right across the political spectrum. He was hardly a household name, but as an actor with 30 years\u2019 experience \u2013 much of it with black theatre groups \u2013 he was well-respected within the industry, and starting to show promise as a director. But overnight he had become a pariah.\n\nLennon wrote a column for the Guardian, explaining that the Sunday Times had misrepresented him \u2013 but refused all other requests for comment. The controversy was taking its toll. He went to ground, took time off work, and came very close to taking his own life.\n\nTen months on, Lennon has chosen to tell his story for the first time. Rather than trying to \u201cpass\u201d as black, he says, he has spent a lifetime failing to pass as white \u2013 from babyhood to the present day. And many years ago he decided to embrace that \u2013 to live with the identity the rest of the world persisted in giving him.\n\n***\n\nLennon first calls me out of the blue in July. We have never met, but a mutual friend has suggested he get in touch. He outlines his story, and says he has just received information that sheds new light on his racial identity. He sounds nervous, and asks if we can meet.\n\nFrom the moment I was born, I used to feel I\u2019d damaged my family \u2013 that my arrival was like a bomb had gone off\n\nA few days later, we get together for a coffee. Lennon, aged 53, has an extraordinary face \u2013 sculpted cheekbones, caterpillar eyebrows, flared nostrils, piercing blue eyes. These days his head is shaved, but as a child and young man he had an afro; that was the way his hair grew naturally. He shows me a series of photographs. Here he is with his younger brother, Vincent, aged six and four \u2013 two cute, gap-toothed, mixed-race boys, or so you would assume. There he is at 18, body-popping with his all-black crew in London. And in his early 20s, as a politicised young man with a big afro worn under his black leather beret. Sometimes he looks black, sometimes mixed race. The one thing he doesn\u2019t look is white.\n\nWe agree to meet again in a couple of weeks. Meanwhile he emails and texts me regularly, almost obsessively \u2013 notes, mini essays, childhood recollections, most of them painful. He remembers being with Vincent in a cupboard upstairs, hiding from the prying neighbours who had come round for a nosy at the two strange children; friends asking where his black parent was; the school caretaker threatening to set dogs on him and telling him, \u201cRun, nigger.\u201d\n\nAlmost a year into his stint at Talawa, Lennon says he was warned by the company\u2019s artistic director Michael Buffong that a number of people weren\u2019t happy about him winning the award, but he didn\u2019t think much about it. Nobody had said anything to him, and he assumed any mutterings would subside.\n\nLennon\u2019s mother\u2026\n\n\u2026and father. Photographs: courtesy of Anthony Ekundayo Lennon\n\nWhen the story broke last year, Buffong released a statement saying, \u201cI have always been aware of Anthony\u2019s unique and complicated story. For my generation, and when Talawa started as a company in 1986, there was a spirit of inclusivity which meant that he was accepted by many, inside the organisation and externally, as a person of mixed heritage.\u201d The Arts Council backed this up, arguing: \u201cThis is a very unusual case and we do not think it undermines the support we provide to black and minority ethnic people within the theatre sector.\u201d Forty-eight prominent black artists and activists wrote to the Guardian in support of Lennon, including Michaela Coel, Clarke Peters, Roy Williams and Lennon\u2019s friend, the actor and writer Lennie James. Lennon shows me a text he recently received from James: \u201cI just want to check in to make sure you\u2019re good and looking after yourself. Remember you don\u2019t have to say, answer or justify yourself to anyone. Those who know you know you. If people aren\u2019t ready for the nuance of the conversation, you may just have to wait for them to catch up. Don\u2019t get dragged back. I\u2019m thinking of you, my friend. Be strong.\u201d\n\nLennon was anything but strong, though. The allegation that he was a fraud was devastating. All his life, he says, his mother had worked to instil in him her core values: don\u2019t lie, say please and thank you, don\u2019t bring police to my door. And here he was, accused not only of living a lie but of making money out of it.\n\nHis first worry was the impact the accusation would have on her. \u201cI saw a look in my mum\u2019s eyes when she was telling me about the reporters knocking on her door or loitering around the back. I\u2019d never seen her looking so frightened and so confused. I felt completely helpless and I wanted to take it all away.\u201d His voice rises, and he starts crying. \u201cFrom the moment I was born, I used to feel I\u2019d damaged my family \u2013 that my arrival was like a bomb had gone off.\u201d It had taken him so long to feel OK about himself, and now he felt he\u2019d done the worst thing possible: he made life difficult for his mother.\n\n***\n\nWhen I ask Lennon why he is so sure that he is not the result of an affair, he smiles and says he knows his mother. But there is more to it than that; his two younger brothers also looked mixed race, the youngest less strikingly so. But Lennon asks if I really believe that his mother would have such a long-term affair, given the hostility she faced. She told him that when he was a baby, people would stare at the two of them in the street \u2013 if they were lucky. \u201cSome would shout at her from the other side of the road, some would spit, some would throw stones at the pram. But we\u2019re talking the 60s \u2013 Enoch Powell, teddy boys, skinheads,\u201d he says. Even his grandmother told him he was a curse on the family, and sent him to bed clutching rosary beads so he could pray for forgiveness. A Sunday school worker chastised him for using a light brown pencil when drawing a picture of himself and Vincent; maybe they looked the way they did because they had been bad when they were younger, he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With actor and writer Michaela Coel. Photograph: courtesy of Anthony Ekundayo Lennon\n\nHis mother hated talking about \u201cit\u201d \u2013 the bewildering appearance of her boys \u2013 so she didn\u2019t. As an adult, Lennon discovered that his father had accused her of having an affair. He says his appearance must have created such tension, he is amazed they stayed together for so long \u2013 until he was 12. \u201cHow do you apologise for accusing your partner of having an affair when they didn\u2019t?\u201d he asks. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re the mother of this child and you\u2019ve got all these fingers pointing at you, the pain that must have come with that...\u201d He trails off. While he and his brothers looked mixed race, they also resembled their father. Lennon says he doesn\u2019t like to use the word, but can\u2019t think of another that does the job: he believes he is a \u201cthrowback\u201d. Yes, his family is white as far back as he can go \u2013 but he is sure that there is African ancestry somewhere.\n\nAt school, Lennon says, most of his friends were black or mixed race. He doesn\u2019t know why he always gravitated towards people of colour \u2013 and they towards him. Back then, he didn\u2019t have either the language or perspective to describe what was happening. He has some happy memories of that time: the school friend who snuck him an afro comb in solidarity; the neighbours who cooked him and Vincent African-Caribbean food and sorted out their hair on Saturdays; the ticket collector at the underground station letting him sit on the tall stool inside his ticket box, because he looked like his son; the friends who called him \u201cSidders\u201d, after Sidney Poitier, when he told them he wanted to be an actor.\n\nCasting directors often told my agent that there were no parts for mixed-race characters\n\nAs teenagers, both Lennon and Vincent developed nervous tics. He says that Vincent struggled with his identity, but in a different way; he couldn\u2019t understand why Anthony embraced his \u201cblackness\u201d. Vincent became a skinhead and petty criminal, and suffered from depression. At the age of 19, he died after a terrible incident on a train: a door opened and he fell on to the tracks. That day, he had phoned their mother to tell her that he loved her \u2013 something he rarely, if ever, did. An investigation into Vincent\u2019s death (in which a witness described him as \u201chalf-caste\u201d) concluded that there was no fault with the door, and Lennon has always been convinced that his brother intended to take his own life. \u201cI was devastated by his death, and still am.\u201d\n\nAs a teenager, Anthony found his home in drama classes. He loved acting and decided he was going to make a career of it. But as soon as he turned professional, he realised the range of roles he was being offered was limited. \u201cCasting directors often told my agent that there were no parts for mixed-race characters,\u201d he says. Again and again, the same roles came up: loud, aggressive men, running into trouble or away from the law. Often the characters were criminals; occasionally, they were victims of a miscarriage of justice.\n\nHe started to turn down roles because of the negative stereotypes. One part he did accept was in The Bill, playing a young man falsely accused of robbery: \u201cThe only reason I did it was because my character wasn\u2019t guilty.\u201d He watched the clip again recently and was reminded how many of the characters he played were the butt of racism. \u201cAt one point the police officer says to my character, \u2018We know it\u2019s you because we\u2019ve got a set of prints.\u2019 I say, \u2018Fingerprints?\u2019 and he replies, \u2018No, lip prints.\u2019\u201d\n\nLennon says that, more than anything else, it was the prejudice he experienced as a child and young adult that made him want to identify as black. The Sunday schoolteacher and his own grandmother may have thought his appearance was something to be ashamed of, but he didn\u2019t. If their attitudes were representative of being white, he was happy to renounce his whiteness.\n\nIn 1990, Lennon appeared in a TV play called Chilling Out, as part of the BBC\u2019s Everyman slot. He sends me a link: it\u2019s a brilliantly nuanced exploration of race, class and identity, in which seven young actors \u2013 including Lennie James \u2013 talk about the \u201cexperience and spirit of being black\u201d in Britain. Although the actors played themselves and the scenes began with improvisation, the end result was a scripted docudrama. When Lennon is asked about his backstory, he says he is from Ireland. The other actors nod approvingly, and ask which island. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cIreland, Ireland\u201d, and goes on to explain that both his parents are white. The others look at him astonished and suggest he is in denial about his blackness; there are jokes about his mother and the milkman.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In the BBC Everyman play Chilling Out in 1990: the other actors suggested Lennon was in denial about his blackness\n\nThe conversation moves on: if it is true that his parents are white, is he in denial, his fellow actors ask. Is race an objective truth, or a construct based on what others see in you, and what you see in the mirror? Lennon is asked how he himself identifies. He looks bashful, and says he has never talked about this before. \u201cWhen I\u2019m alone in my bedroom looking in the mirror, thinking about stuff I\u2019ve written down, thinking about my past, relationship-wise, pictures on the wall, I think I\u2019m a black man. I\u2019ve not said that to anyone. And I won\u2019t say it outside.\u201d James tells the group he has seen Lennon changing over the six years of their friendship, and is puzzled by it. \u201cSometimes I feel like you are watching me,\u201d he says. \u201cWatching me to say, this equals a black man. Then you\u2019re taking it from me and sticking it on yourself.\u201d\n\nWhen the Sunday Times story appeared, Chilling Out was cited as evidence that Lennon was a fraud, with James quoted as a witness for the prosecution. For Lennon, this was a deliberate misreading \u2013 of him, of James, of their friendship. At the time the drama was made, James had known about Lennon\u2019s parentage for years. Perhaps more importantly, Lennon says, it should be obvious to anybody watching Chilling Out that the other actors were eager to help him make peace with his complex identity, rather than accuse him of cultural misappropriation.\n\nOne of the last conversations I had with Dad, he said, 'You\u2019re white and I think you\u2019ve got an identity problem'\n\nSoon after making Chilling Out, Lennon decided to change his name formally. Anthony David Lennon did not reflect who he was, he thought, so he became Soweto Alkebulan Ekundayo: Soweto because his friend and mentor Paul Kinch had a son called Soweto (now a celebrated saxophonist); Alkebulan because it is said to be the earliest name for Africa; Ekundayo because he liked the sound of the Yoruban name, and discovered it meant \u201cweeping becomes joy\u201d. He started reading literature about black culture and politics, withdrew from the acting world and moved to Manchester, where he dedicated himself to developing his political consciousness. He read up on the history of British imperialism. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said all the literature I read was about loving black culture \u2013 some was derogatory about white people. I just wanted to read stories by black people, about black culture and history.\u201d\n\nHe had two daughters, who are now in their 20s \u2013 one is a dancer, the other works in the film industry \u2013 and named the oldest Soweto, too. Lennon\u2019s mother continued to call him Anthony, but quietly embraced his African identity. His father, who died in 1999, thought Lennon had lost the plot. \u201cOne of the last conversations I had with Dad was him saying, \u2018As far as I\u2019m concerned you\u2019re white and I think you\u2019ve got an identity problem.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome time after changing his name, he met the educational consultant Paul Wilson-Eme, who went on to have a huge influence on him. Wilson-Eme asked him why he had called himself Soweto. Lennon mentioned the obvious: the associations with South Africa, black pride, the uprising. Wilson-Eme asked him if he knew what Soweto meant. \u201cTo my shame I had no answer. Then he filled in the missing gaps \u2013 it stands for South West Township. Then he said, \u2018I love you, my brother, but I think you need to check in with yourself as to why you have named yourself that.\u2019\u201d So he simply became Ekundayo. Then he changed his name legally again, choosing Taharka as a first name.\n\nHis agent got in touch and said that directors were still keen to hire him, but there was a problem: if he returned to acting as Taharka Ekundayo, there would be too much explaining to do. \u201cShe said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we compromise \u2013 bring Anthony Lennon back, and put Ekundayo in the middle? Casting directors will know it\u2019s the same old Anthony Lennon, but Ekundayo is there out of respect for your ancestry.\u201d\n\nAnd so began his fifth, and happiest, incarnation \u2013 as Anthony Ekundayo Lennon. He returned to the theatre, working largely for black-led companies, and segued from acting to directing. For two decades, he lived easy in his skin \u2013 a man with white parents, unknown African ancestry, and many friends, none of whom questioned his right to be who he said he was. When I ask if he ever considered he might not meet the criteria for the Talawa award, he says no: \u201cTo doubt my eligibility would be akin to doubting my existence.\u201d\n\n***\n\nAfter the story broke, Lennon tells me people pointed at him in public places. I can\u2019t help thinking of the little boy and his mother who were demonised in the streets 50 years ago. \u201cIt was surreal and scary, and the start of many panic attacks and sleepless nights,\u201d he says. His worst childhood memories returned.\n\nHe says he reached his nadir soon afterwards. \u201cI\u2019m going to be totally up front with you. There\u2019s a little part of me that knows I don\u2019t want to say this next bit, because I worry about what family and friends will think.\u201d He sips from the pint of strawberry and lime lager he\u2019s been nursing for two hours. \u201cI went to a tube station. I took myself to the mouth of the tunnel and looked at the tracks. I just felt I didn\u2019t want any of this any more. I didn\u2019t want the toxicity, the pain, the accusations. I was imagining everything my dad went though, my mum, my brother. I came so close.\u201d\n\nIn the end, he says, what stopped him was thinking about his mother and his daughters. He sweeps away a tear. \u201cAnd this is a message for anybody else thinking about it: force yourself to think about somebody you love, or who would desperately miss you if you are no longer there. Find a reason not to do it, then don\u2019t. Let the next morning arrive.\u201d He repeats the last sentence, more to himself than to me. \u201cLet the next morning arrive.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I\u2019ve never not spoken about being of mixed heritage while having white parents.\u2019 Photograph: David Vintiner/The Guardian\n\nHe returned to work and saw out his contract at Talawa, which ended a couple of weeks ago. During his final months he mentored young artists, directed a reimagined Othello called Men Are Not Gods, and continued to learn the craft of running a theatre company. It\u2019s been a tough year, but he says Buffong and other staff have always been supportive.\n\nIn March this year, Lennon was invited to the Globe theatre\u2019s press night for Richard II \u2013 the first all-women-of-colour production of a Shakespeare play in the UK. Despite Talawa\u2019s backing, it was the first major industry event he had attended since the media storm. He says it was an inspiring night \u2013 both the production, and the support from friends. But at the afterparty he struggled. \u201cI noticed a few people who I didn\u2019t know looking over at me, and it was clear I was being whispered about. I felt othered for the first time ever, in a space with a group of artists.\u201d But he says no actor or director has ever challenged him to his face. A couple of months ago, Lennon was verbally attacked by a stranger on the underground. \u201cA black guy came up to me, and said, \u2018You\u2019re a fraud, you\u2019re a thief.\u2019 A couple of people stood between us because they thought he might physically attack me. He was really angry: \u2018You\u2019re that guy in the paper. Why are you pretending?\u2019\u201d Did Lennon defend himself verbally? \u201cNo, because there\u2019s nothing to defend.\u201d By now, he was feeling stronger.\n\nWould he have qualms about working for a black-led theatre company in the future? \u201cNo!\u201d He sounds appalled. \u201cI\u2019ll work with anyone who wants to have a conversation with me, anyone who\u2019s interested in telling stories. I\u2019d really like to direct plays, please, and lead a company. That\u2019s why I was put on the artistic directors\u2019 programme in the first place.\u201d\n\nI ask him about the news he mentioned when he first called me a couple of months ago. Lennon smiles and whips out an envelope containing the results of an ancestry DNA test he recently took. It shows his genetic makeup, country by country: 46% Irish and Scottish, 22% from England, Wales and north-western Europe. He points me to the last stat: 32% West African. The science of ancestry DNA testing is not infallible, but it feels like a significant result. Does he feel vindicated? \u201cAll it\u2019s done for me is confirmed in data what I\u2019ve always known.\u201d Some time in the future, he will trace those African roots right back through his family. But for now only one thing matters to him \u2013 that they are there.\n\n\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).", "description": "All his life, people have assumed the theatre director is mixed race \u2013 and he was happy to embrace that identity.
