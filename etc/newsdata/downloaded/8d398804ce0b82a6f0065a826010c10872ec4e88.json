The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has previously gone after YouTubers for scams in which they encouraged followers to gamble CS:GO skins, slapping them with thousands in fines.\n\nGizmodo has reached out to Valve for comment, and we\u2019ll update this post if we hear back.", "description": "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive came out all the way back in 2012\u2014though it still has a large player base and its tie-ins with the Steam Community marketplace have remained active long after developer Valve\u2019s attention mostly went elsewhere.
