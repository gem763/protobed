They\u2019re some of the most common complaints in doctors\u2019 offices. But for more than 10 million people, gas, bloating, constipation, diarrhea or heartburn are a regular occurrence.\n\nWhen your doctor can\u2019t find an underlying reason for the problem, it\u2019s dubbed a \u201cfunctional\u201d gastrointestinal disorder, meaning there\u2019s no specific cause, which makes it even more frustrating to deal with.\n\nIn many cases, though, there\u2019s a way to get some relief. \u201cThere can be many causes of these problems, but often, if we can\u2019t point to one thing, altering the diet might help,\u201d says Robert Hirten, an assistant professor of medicine and gastroenterology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.\n\nAlthough chronic digestive disruptions warrant a doctor\u2019s attention, \u201cgenerally about 80 percent of patients will benefit from doing some sort of diet intervention,\u201d says Melissa Phillips, a clinical nutritionist at the University of Wisconsin Health System\u2019s Digestive Health Center.\n\nHere are eating strategies that can help keep your gastrointestinal tract in good working order.\n\nGo Mediterranean\n\nYour digestive system is teeming with healthy bacteria (think probiotics) and other microorganisms that aid in digestion, bolster your immunity and provide overall health benefits.\n\nA Mediterranean-style diet \u00ad\u2014 rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, olive oil and nuts, with some fish, dairy and lean meat \u2014 supplies fiber to feed beneficial bacteria. And olive oil contains antioxidant polyphenols that may help control inflammation.\n\nA Mediterranean-style diet is also low in added sugars and processed foods, two factors that are important for a healthy gut, Hirten says.\n\nIncrease your fiber\n\nEven if you don\u2019t switch to a Mediterranean diet, you should get plenty of fiber-rich foods \u2014 fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes. Eating 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day can help normalize diarrhea and constipation, Hirten says.\n\nThere are two forms of fiber. Soluble fiber helps lower cholesterol and possibly blood sugar; sources include apples, oats and legumes. Insoluble fiber helps bulk up stool and promotes the contractions in the intestines that propel it through your system; sources include whole wheat, popcorn and green vegetables.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re constipated, add more insoluble fiber,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cIf you have diarrhea, opt for more soluble fiber.\u201d But incorporate fiber gradually into your diet. If you try to do it all at once, you might exacerbate your symptoms.\n\nDrink enough water\n\nFiber absorbs water, making stools softer and easier to pass. If you\u2019re dehydrated, fiber will be less effective and may cause more digestive symptoms.\n\nThere\u2019s no set guide\u00adline for how much fluid to drink, but eight cups a day is a safe goal for most people. Water, sparkling water, milk, juice and noncaffeinated beverages count toward your daily intake amount, Phillips says, but water is the best. Sparkling water, milk and juice can sometimes trigger bloating.\n\nAdd natural probiotics\n\nYogurt and other fermented foods such as sauerkraut, kefir and miso may help populate your gut with healthy bacteria. There are no guidelines for how often to eat probiotic foods, but trying to incorporate them as part of an overall healthy diet could help.\n\nSupplements that contain \u201clive cultures\u201d and strains of bacteria haven\u2019t been shown to benefit digestion. \u201cI rarely recommend people start taking probiotic supplements, simply because we just don\u2019t have enough evidence to suggest it helps or hurts,\u201d says Meagan Bridges, a clinical dietitian and nutrition support specialist at the Uni\u00adversity of Virginia Health System.\n\nEat on a schedule\n\nYour digestive system prefers a routine. \u201cIt likes to know when you\u2019re going to be eating and how much, so it knows when to work and when to rest,\u201d Bridges says. \u201cI tell my patients to try to eat at about the same time each day and the same amount of food.\u201d Constant grazing or an erratic schedule can result in constipation.\n\nIn addition, avoid eating right before bed, which can lead to heartburn or indigestion. \u201cDigestion slows down at night, and it takes longer for food to be absorbed,\u201d Bridges says.\n\nSlow down at meals\n\nDigestion begins in the mouth, so thorough chewing sets the stage for the rest of the process. In addition, eating quickly or gulping down your food can make it easy to swallow air and lead to belching.\n\nCheck your supplements\n\nIron can cause constipation and magnesium can lead to diarrhea, Phillips says. In addition, some supplements as well as over-the-counter and prescription drugs can contain sorbitol or mannitol, sugar alcohols that may have a laxative effect or cause gas and bloating.\n\nAn eating plan for tummy troubles\n\nFor some people, even healthy foods \u2014 such as cauliflower, cashews, lentils, onions, peaches and wheat \u2014 can cause gas, bloating and discomfort. That\u2019s because foods like these contain hard-to-digest carbohydrates called fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols. (FODMAPs). A 2016 study published in Clinical and Experimental Gas\u00adtro\u00adenterology found that a low-FODMAP diet may help irritable bowel syndrome and may be particularly beneficial for people who have abdominal pain along with constipation or diarrhea.\n\nFollowing a low-FODMAP diet, which involves eliminating these foods for two to six weeks, then slowly adding them back in small amounts, may help but should be done in consultation with a dietitian, Phillips says. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a learning diet, not a permanent one.\u201d\n\nBut before you start cutting out things, Hirten recommends tracking what you eat and drink and your symptoms for a week. \u201cIt can give your doctor clues about potential triggers and make the connection between foods and symptoms much clearer for the patient, too,\u201d he says.\n\nIs it time to call the doctor?\n\nOccasional digestive upset is normal, but anytime you have symptoms that won\u2019t go away, check with your doctors. And alert them immediately if you notice the following:\n\n\u25cfBloody stools.\n\n\u25cfSevere abdominal pain.\n\n\u25cfTender or swollen abdomen.\n\n\u25cfPersistent nausea or \u00advomiting.\n\n\u25cfFever.\n\n\u25cfDiarrhea that lasts more than two days.\n\nCopyright 2019, Consumer Reports Inc.", "description": "How and what you eat can keep your gastrointestinal tract in good working order.", "authors": ["Consumer Reports", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/d0qc2435zOrFO_wn1jIRul9WFlk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KKY5CHWKPEI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg"}
