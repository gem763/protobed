Most of them do,\" Scarborough said on Monday. \"But again, I\u2019d speak to the lock him up chants. Again, it\u2019s un-American. It started with Donald Trump. In fact, he\u2019s made it a center piece of his campaign rallies.\"\n\n\u201cWe find it sickening when it happens in his rallies. I find it kind of sickening to watch people [chanting] at the president,\" Brzezinski said.\n\n\"Of course it\u2019s sickening. We are Americans and we do not do that. We do not want the world hearing us chant, lock him up, to this president, or to any president \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, let\u2019s hope, as we move forward, maybe this is one less fascist tactic he and his supporters use, during chants. You are going to actually imprison your political opponents. So let\u2019s leave that behind,\" Scarborough added.\n\nScarborough continued to make the case against the chant on his Twitter account.\n\nIf you think that democracy is strengthened by calling for the arrest of political opponents, you\u2019re as ignorant and illiberal as Trump himself. Delete your account and read some civics.\n\nStop embarrassing yourself. \u2014 Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) October 28, 2019\n\nAlso in attendance with Trump at the game included many Republican senators and congressmen, but also five wounded veterans.", "description": ".10/28/2019 20:12:45PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/301/12b06e46-ec07-46f2-a094-57899c610539.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
