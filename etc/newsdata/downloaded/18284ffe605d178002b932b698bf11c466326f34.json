At first it was treason and now it is annoying president Museveni. Who on earth can't be annoyed?\" Wine told AFP.\n\n\"It is a ridiculous charge and am ready to challenge it in court,\" he said.\n\nThe new accusation against Wine comes just days after prominent activist Stella Nyanzi was sentenced to 18 months in prison over her vulgar posts on social media against Museveni - which she sees as a way to get her message across.", "description": "A Ugandan court has charged pop star turned leading opposition figure Bobi Wine with \"annoying\" President Yoweri Museveni, his lawyer says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7965/bd8ddee4039e440e99118cb8cfb96607.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-06"}
