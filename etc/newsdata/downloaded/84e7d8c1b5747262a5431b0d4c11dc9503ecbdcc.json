But it won\u2019t be directing the money through Afghan President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s government, which Pompeo said is \u201cincapable of being a partner.\u201d\n\nPompeo blamed the \u201cAfghan government's inability to transparently manage U.S. Government resources,\u201d for walking back the funds, but said the U.S. would still build the five power substations and maze of transmission lines in southern Afghanistan.\n\nWashington is withholding the other $60 million in aid and will not be redirecting it to projects in Afghanistan on the belief that Ghani\u2019s government is neither transparent nor accountable in its spending.\n\nTALIBAN VIOLENCE IN AFGHANISTAN RAMPS UP AS SUICIDE BOMB KILLS AT LEAST 20\n\nThe U.S. is also cutting off all funding to the Afghan body in charge of government corruption, the Monitoring and Evaluation Committee, saying it is \u201cincapable of being a partner in the international effort to build a better future for the Afghan people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe stand against those who exploit their positions of power and influence to deprive the Afghan people of the benefits of foreign assistance and a more prosperous future,\" Pompeo said in a statement.\n\nSpecial Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction John Sopko cited reports dating back nine years in which hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid to the nation is missing, wasted on corrupt contracts and wasteful spending.\n\nAfter 18 years with troops in the nation and $800 billion dollars, the U.S. decision to pull back funding from Afghanistan marks a significant pivot-- the Afghan government depends almost entirely on foreign assistance.\n\nThe decision comes one day after the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, John Bass, called out the National Procurement Authority on Twitter for not approving the purchase of fuel for thermal electricity.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile speaking with reporters, Pompeo said his intended message for Ghani is that the U.S. wants to see free and fair elections on Sept. 28, when Ghani will face off against competitors for a second five-year term. The 2014 presidential election was riddled with widespread fraud, as was the parliamentary election last year.\n\nThe presidential election has already been delayed twice, and the Taliban denounced the election as a sham and vowed to attack rallies-- on Sept. 17, they attacked a campaign rally for Ghani, killing 26 and wounding 42.\n\nThe Taliban want the election canceled as a condition for intra-Afghan dialogue, and some of Ghani\u2019s main opponents have dropped out of the race for the sake of peace.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Washington is rescinding $160 million directed to Afghanistan, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Thursday, citing unacceptable levels of corruption in the Afghan government.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/AP19243123927773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
