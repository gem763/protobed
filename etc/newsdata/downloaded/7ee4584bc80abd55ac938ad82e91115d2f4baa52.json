The bipartisan legislation, supported by both Republicans and Democrats, would require that the US government assess whether political developments in Hong Kong justify Washington changing its treatment of the city as a separate trading entity from the Chinese mainland.\n\nLawmakers also approved a bill that blocks the export of crowd control equipment, such as tear gas, to Hong Kong authorities.\n\nReturning after a two-week break, the lower chamber of Congress approved the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, a bill that Beijing considers an attempt to interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs and contain the country\u2019s rise.\n\n\n\nThe legislation also paves the way for sanctions against individuals deemed responsible for actions to undermine Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, such as the rendition to the mainland of anyone exercising \u201cinternationally recognised human rights in Hong Kong\u201d.\n\nThe bill awaits a vote in the Senate, where it currently enjoys the bipartisan co-sponsorship of 23 senators, and is expected to pass.\n\nThe legislation blocking the export of US-made police equipment, such as tear gas, to Hong Kong is known as the PROTECT Hong Kong Act, introduced by Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nLawmakers also passed a resolution to recognise the city\u2019s bilateral relationship with the US and \u201ccondemn the interference of the People\u2019s Republic of China in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs\u201d.\n\nApplauding the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticised those who sided with Beijing for fear of jeapordising their economic interests.\n\n\u201cTo those who want to take the repressive government\u2019s side in this discussion, I say to you: What does it profit a person if he gains the whole world and suffers the loss of his soul?\u201d she said on the House floor.\n\nAn attempt by US President Donald Trump, who last Friday said that relations with the Chinese government were now a \u201clove fest\u201d after the announcement of a partial trade agreement, to veto the legislation could be overruled by a two-thirds majority in both parts of Congress.\n\nTuesday\u2019s action in the House came a day after tens of thousands of Hongkongers took to the streets to urge US lawmakers to pass the legislation. In the first police-sanctioned rally since authorities imposed emergency laws earlier this month, protesters waved American flags and chanted slogans lauding the US as a \u201cprotector of freedom\u201d and \u201cregulator of world order\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re simply urging the Chinese president [Xi Jinping] and the Hong Kong chief executive [Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor] to faithfully honour the government\u2019s promises,\u201d Smith told lawmakers ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote.", "description": "Lawmakers also approved a bill that blocks the export of equipment like tear gas to the HK police.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/fd13f3e8-ef7d-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires072817.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
