Ur just getting better with time! Thank you for making my wildest dreams come true!'\n\nKesha had previously lost an appeal last year, but the court granted her reconsideration to preview her arguments and evidence supporting her appeal\n\nThe card, which was given some time after 2009, is signed by Kesha and a name that is unclear but could be her older brother Lagan.\n\nDr Luke argues that Kesha and here mother Pebe Sebert launched their smear campaign in a bid to extort him.\n\nThat card, among other things, offers proof that Dr Luke never raped the singer, reason his attorneys.\n\nKesha publicly alleged that Dr Luke drugged and raped her when she was 18 while trying to get out of her contract with the producer and parent company Sony, a bid that was denied in 2016 by a judge.\n\nDr Luke also submitted a detailed public relations campaign that was put together by Sunshine Sachs as evidence.\n\nThat plan detailed how the agency planned to assist Kesha's legal team 'by inciting a deluge of negative media attention and public pressure on the basis of the horrific personal abuses presented in the lawsuit. '\n\nThe agency also spoke about how they would leak details of lawsuits before they became public to TMZ so as to allow the website time to plan a post.\n\nThere are also a number of emails sent by Kesha's mother in which she praises the producer.\n\n'I know you are going to be a great dad,' writes Pebe Sebert in one email.\n\n'You are part of our family,' she tells Dr Luke in another exchange submitted as evidence in the case.\n\nIn May 2009 she told Dr Luke: 'Thank you for all you do for Kesha. We both love you.'\n\nAnd in 2010 she wrote: 'Thank you Luke . You have changed our lives forever. I love you !!'\n\nThe defamation case also includes lengthy depositions from Dr Luke and Kesha.\n\nDr Luke made claims about Kesha being a liar after he was questioned about her claim that he had raped her when she was a teenager.\n\nHer lawyer asks at one point: 'Are you aware that Ms. Sebert - that there is evidence in the record that Ms. Sebert told doctors and medical providers that she had been raped by you prior to 2014 or prior to this lawsuit?'\n\nDailyMail.com saw that evidence, which Dr Luke dismissed by stating: 'I don't -- in sum and substance, I think that is -- that you are wrong to say that she has spoken to multiple doctors prior to these lawsuits and said that she was raped by me. I would say that that is not a correct statement.'\n\nIt was later asked if Dr Luke had any knowledge of Kesha telling people he had drugged her, years prior to filing her suit.\n\nThat was the final straw for Dr Luke.\n\n'Kesha's a liar and Kesha lied a lot. And it was something that I spoke to her about quite a bit. And she apologized to me and admitted that she lied,' claimed Dr Luke.\n\n'And if you're talking about the email from Jared Scharff, it also says afterwards that she - afterwards did - was completely drunk and wasted and did a tequila shot on the hood of his friend's car.'\n\nThat last comment drew the attention of Kesha's lawyer who asked: 'What does that have to do with anything?'\n\nIt was later asked of Dr Luke why he was so eager to work with Kesha if she was such a liar.\n\n'She apologized to me. She, you know, it was one of the conditions of us moving forward and working again when she came back and wanted to work with me again,' said Dr Luke.\n\n'And I said, \"Hey, you need to make this right and you've got to be responsible and you can't just make up stories.\" A lot of the lies that Kesha told were sort of, I'd say, maybe non-harmful lies, like, you know, her father is Mick Jagger. About, you know, breaking into Prince's house. And, you know, like -- she had a whole lot of stories that she would tell.'\n\nHe then said he never thought she would 'stoop so low' as lie about rape.\n\n'I've witnessed somebody lying about rape and making something up like that and it's disgusting. And it's -- you know, it's -- it's a horrible thing. It does incredible damage.'\n\nHe continued: 'And it's really horrible to women who actually have been raped which is a very serious, you know, serious problem. And it's disgusting. And, you know, the truth is, is I'd seen glimpses of it but never imagined it could be this bad.'\n\nIn her debut single Tik Tok, Kesha sang about kicking men to the curb 'unless they look like Mick Jagger.'", "description": "Dr Luke - real name Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald - is suing the singer for defamation, claiming that Kesha made false claims about him so that he would release her from  recording contract", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/17/19548100-0-image-a-2_1570724599476.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
