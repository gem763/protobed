It was the outstanding moment for sure. A lot of experts, myself probably included, wouldn't have bet money on us.\n\n\"Because being 3-0 down against a team with Messi, Suarez and all those players looks like a death sentence. We didn't believe we'd win, we just knew we had a chance, and we believed in that chance.\n\n\"It was massive. The support we had in the stadium. Looking back, we could say we won the Champions League in that game. All of us will remember it forever.\"\n\nKlopp explained how he tried to inspire his side to one of European football's great comebacks.\n\nHe added: \"I said [to the team], 'I normally wouldn't think it's possible, but because it's you, we have a chance'.\n\n\"That was exactly what I thought and what I felt. And from the first minute we were literally all over Barcelona.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"And at that moment, I thought 'we are ready at least', and it's very difficult to cope with a team like us and the atmosphere in the stadium in moments like this.\"", "description": "Barcelona's 3-0 first leg lead in the Champions League looked like a death sentence for Liverpool, says manager Jurgen Klopp.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pfMlOYCuCACTekTSLpmKKw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2l3pm5x.vvcVRSSG7Y.PrQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/a8f5a63999ff97512a2a410ea18499f3", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
