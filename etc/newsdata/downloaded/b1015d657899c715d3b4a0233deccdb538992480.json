I don\u2019t decide to trade them. I don\u2019t decide to release them. I don\u2019t decide to draft them. I don\u2019t get asked; I show up and do my job. I\u2019m an employee like everyone else. I\u2019m going to show this week and do the best I can do as quarterback\u2026Maybe one day I will be an owner and I can make all the decisions that I want.\u201d\n\nBrady added in a separate interview on WEEI that he had \u201ca lot of personal feelings\u201d about the situation but didn\u2019t care to elaborate on any of them.\n\nTOM BRADY'S POPULARITY TIED TO RISE IN 'WHITE RAGE AND WHITE SUPREMACY,' PROFESSOR SAYS\n\nWhen the team signed Brown, Brady was one of the more prominent players on the team to try and take him under his wing during the 11 days he was with New England.\n\nNBC\u2019s Al Michaels reported that Brady had offered Brown the chance to stay in his home as he got acclimated to the team.
