Swanson has lost his last four bouts, but they have come against top competition and he has been competitive in each of them. That knowledge makes gauging his form, aside from the pure win-loss numbers, a tricky task ahead of his bout with the undefeated, but significantly less-experienced Gracie (5-0 MMA, 1-0 UFC) this weekend.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what MMA Junkie\u2019s fight analyst Dan Tom has attempted to do this week as he looks to cut through the pure stats and assess the matchup itself ahead of Saturday night\u2019s co-main event clash.\n\nCheck out the fight breakdown in the video above.", "description": "MMA Junkie fight analyst Dan Tom takes a closer look at the UFC Tampa co-headliner between Cub Swanson and Kron Gracie.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Dan Tom", "Mike Bohn", "Matt Erickson", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bd-ufc-on-espn-19-co-main.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
