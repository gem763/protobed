Nine, which owns PEDESTRIAN.TV, has joined News Corp, the ABC, SBS, The Guardian, and the Media, Entertainment, and Arts Alliance to form the Right To Know coalition, urging the Australian government to install new protections for whistleblowers, reform defamation law, and exempt journalists from prosecution under current national security laws.\n\nToday\u2019s front pages come just months after the Australian Federal Police conducted raids on the home of News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst and the ABC\u2019s Sydney offices, following their respective reports on proposed changes to national security laws and allegations of serious misconduct by Australia\u2019s armed forces.\n\n\u201cAll journalists and media outlets have had a gutful of the insidious, creeping, and ultimately dangerous efforts of governments to discourage whistleblowing by intimidation, by threats, by prosecutions of whistleblowers, and the raids on journalists\u2019 homes,\u201d Thomas told PEDESTRIAN.TV.\n\nThe multiple Walkley Award-winner said the threat of legal action against whistleblowers could prevent the Australian public from learning vital information.\n\n\u201cAustralians will ultimately be much worse off if whistleblowers who tell journalists the truth about what\u2019s really going on are silenced and intimidated into keeping their heads down,\u201d Thomas said.\n\n\u201cHow would we ever know about terrible situations in aged care, in our health system, in transport, dangerous situations, if these people don\u2019t speak up?\u201d\n\nThe Age\u2019s investigative reporter Richard Baker agrees, saying there\u2019s currently information Australia should know but can\u2019t, thanks to current threats against press freedom.\n\n\u201cI think whistleblowers are acutely aware of the really devastating consequences for standing up and doing the right thing, and bringing sunlight on abuse of power,\u201d Baker told PEDESTRIAN.TV.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be punished for doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nBaker defended the integrity of Australian journalists and disputed the idea careful public interest reporting could harm national security, saying \u201cnobody wants to have blood on their hands or put people at risk.\u201d\n\nThe campaign comes amid a Senate enquiry focussed on the effects of national security laws on press freedom. The enquiry is slated to report back in December, and journos hope today\u2019s protest will send a clear statement.\n\n\u201cI think the one thing politicians understand is the depth of rivalry and competition between the varying media companies, particularly the two newspaper groups in Australia,\u201d Baker said.\n\n\u201cIt must be heeded by the politicians and public servants, if they know what\u2019s good them,\u201d Thomas added.\n\nYou can read more here.", "description": "National mastheads have banded together to stand against threats to press freedom.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/aus-papers-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
