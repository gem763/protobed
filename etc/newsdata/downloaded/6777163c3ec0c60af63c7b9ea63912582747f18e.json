Pat Toomey said the phone call between President Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president \"reveals no quid pro quo.\" | Mark Wilson/Getty Images congress 'No quid pro quo': Trump\u2019s Republican defenders dig in\n\nFirst it was \u201cno collusion.\u201d Now it\u2019s \u201cno quid pro quo.\u201d\n\nCongressional Republicans are sharpening their messaging and mounting an all-out defense of embattled President Donald Trump, who is facing the greatest threat to his presidency to date as Democrats move ahead with a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nYet with the latest crisis \u2014 which involves Trump pressing Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the Biden family while withholding foreign aid from the country \u2014 Trump and the GOP aren\u2019t leaving anything to chance.\n\nJust a few hours before the Trump administration released a memo of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president Wednesday morning, officials including White House counsel Pat Cipollone summoned a dozen key Republican lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, to the White House to get an early look at the readout and coordinate their talking points.\n\nTrump even called into the meeting from New York at one point to discuss the transcript and answer questions. Not a single GOP lawmaker raised concerns, according to Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who attended the meeting. Then, not long after, Trump saw his White House\u2019s intervention bear out in dozens of floor speeches, tweets and press releases from Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe read it. There was a discussion among members about it,\u201d said Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, who also joined the meeting. \u201cFrom the way the speaker made it out to be yesterday, I was expecting something there. And when you look at it... there\u2019s nothing there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just am embarrassed almost that the speaker would take this document, having not seen it, and take this to an impeachment conversation. There\u2019s nothing in this document that backs up the whistleblower report,\u201d said Perdue. The media \u201ctalked about eight quid pros in there. I can\u2019t find one.\u201d\n\nThe GOP has had years of practice shielding Trump from the controversy du jour, from former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report to hush money payments to porn stars to racist attacks on four Democratic women of color. But now with Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally endorsing an impeachment inquiry, the defenses have become more dire.\n\n\u201cNothing impeachable \u2026 it\u2019s just a huge overreach,\u201d said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.). Asked if all 53 Senate Republicans would vote to defend Trump from efforts to oust him from office, he replied: \u201cYes. Yes.\u201d\n\nNew Window How to read Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president: A line-by-line analysis of the conversation that launched an impeachment inquiry.\n\nAt least one Republican, however, seemed sufficiently pained by the release of the transcript: Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s troubling in the extreme,\u201d Romney said. \u201cEverybody has their own perspective. I indicated \u2026 over the weekend what I thought troubling behavior would be. And asking a leader of a foreign government to investigate a political opponent is, in my opinion, a troubling matter.\u201d\n\nWhile Sen. Pat Toomey called the conversation \u201cinappropriate,\u201d the Pennsylvania Republican said \u201cit does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nIt \u201creveals no quid pro quo,\u201d he added.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said the transcript \u201craises a number of important questions\u201d but that because she may have to be a juror in an impeachment conviction trial \u201cI'm not going to be pre judging the evidence and I'm not going to be commenting on the House's proceedings.\u201d\n\nRomney aside, Republican after Republican has zeroed in on the fact that Trump did not specifically mention foreign aid to Ukraine during the call, according to a readout of the July conversation. That\u2019s proof, they say, that there was no explicit arrangement, which would be a crime.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t find it concerning,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). \u201cThere was no quid pro quo, you\u2019d have to have that if there was going to be anything wrong.\u201d\n\nStill, Trump reminded Zelensky that \"we do a lot for Ukraine\" at the beginning of the call. And only days earlier, the administration froze military aid meant for Ukraine.\n\nThe White House accidentally sent a list of GOP talking points to Democratic offices on Capitol Hill, which outlined three \u201cmyths\u201d to point out: there was no quid pro quo, there was no promise made on the call and Trump referred to Biden \u201cin only one exchange\u201d, the document stated.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/92/57/22be714845deaf4fee508833483a/artboard-3.png\"\n\nThat message was quickly echoed by GOP leaders on Capitol Hill. McCarthy (R-Calif.), a top Trump ally, forcefully pushed back on reporters when they asked for his reaction to Trump mentioning Biden several times during the Ukraine call.\n\n\u201cNo he didn\u2019t. He mentioned it one time,\u201d McCarthy said. The president mentioned Biden several times during the call.\n\nAnd Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump\u2019s top confidants on Capitol Hill, had tweeted four separate times about the absence of a \u201cquid pro quo\" by lunchtime.\n\nDemocrats say the fact that Trump pressed a foreign government to help damage a political rival is grounds enough for impeachment.\n\nThe White House on Wednesday afternoon is planning to hand lawmakers the full whistleblower complaint that brought the Ukraine episode to light, which could provide more damning details and backfire for Republicans who have stuck out their necks to defend Trump.\n\nYet for now, the GOP appears eager to paper over their differences and are practically salivating at the chance to use impeachment as a club over Democrats\u2019 heads.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) even handed out a sheet of \u201cimpeachment ad libs\u201d during a GOP conference meeting Wednesday morning. And the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm on Tuesday blasted out an email with the subject line: \u201cNice knowing you, House Dems!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go and say there\u2019s almost, since yesterday, a kind of giddy atmosphere, because you always have to be careful what you wish for,\u201d said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), vice chairman of the GOP conference. \u201cBut at the same point, if Democrats continue to play the same card, \u2018attack attack attack\u2019, the Republican base isn\u2019t going to bite anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s hilarious,\u201d added Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.). \u201cThis is a sham process.\u201d", "description": "Republicans are sharpening their defense of the president.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona", "Burgess Everett", "Marianne Levine"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/25/b0/b8971d2c49d483c75a8f978c4898/190925-toomey-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
