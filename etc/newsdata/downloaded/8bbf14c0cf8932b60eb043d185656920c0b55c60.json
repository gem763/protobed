Foreign leaders are expected again at this parade, but Beijing has not announced who will be coming.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt has announced some details, however.\n\nThe parade will feature 59 phalanxes, about 15,000 soldiers, 160 aircraft and 580 other pieces of weaponry and equipment, Maj. Gen. Cai Zhijun, deputy director of the military parade office said. About 300,000 civilians will participate in the parade.\n\nBut Defense Ministry spokesman, Wu Qian, dismissed the idea that the People\u2019s Liberation Army, the military force that is beholden by the Communist Party, is \u201cflexing its muscles\u201d to send a message to the outside world.\n\n\u201cOver the past 70 years, the development of the China's armed forces is obvious to all. We had no intention, nor felt the need to flex our muscle through a military parade,\u201d he said at a briefing about parade preparations last week. \u201cOver the past 70 years, the world also witnessed the contributions made by the China's armed forces. The stronger we become, the more contributions we can make to world peace.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImpressive image of the current parade during the rehearsals in overview. For me the most interesting item is the new supersonic reconnaissance drone (now with wings attached?) and the Sharp Sword UCAV.\n\n\n\n(Image via by78/SDF) pic.twitter.com/sJHaye7TtN \u2014 @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) September 28, 2019\n\nAuthorities have carried out three parade rehearsals centered on Tiananmen Square in recent weeks. People have reported seeing war planes, tanks, amphibious assault vehicles, anti-ship and antiaircraft missiles, and supersonic and stealth drones.\n\nHere is some of the firepower we can expect to see at Tuesday\u2019s parade:\n\nThe DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile\n\nThe hardware of the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s Rocket Force is attracting particular attention, amid signs the Dongfeng-41 next generation ICBM may make its debut at the parade. \u201cDongfeng\u201d means \u201ceast wind.\u201d\n\nThe DF-41 is a three-stage, solid-fuel missile with a range of about 7,500 miles, meaning it could strike any target in the United States.\n\nAD\n\nIt can carry up to 10 independently targetable nuclear warheads, Xu Guangyu, a senior adviser of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Global Times, a hawkish party-affiliated newspaper.\n\nAD\n\nThe Global Times quoted military experts saying the fourth-generation nuclear DF-41 missile is \u201cbasically at the same level as the seventh-generation nuclear missiles being developed by the U.S. and Russia, and [has] attained a world-leading level in terms of technologies, materials and processes.\u201d\n\nBecause the DF-41 missile can be armed with a relatively large number of multiple warheads, it \u201cgives China the opportunity to significantly increase the number of deployed warheads without increasing the size of its ballistic arsenal,\u201d Bondaz and Delory wrote in their note.\n\nAD\n\nFurthermore, the missile can carry decoys and penetration aids, boosting its offensive capabilities, and can also change course and trajectory in flight, helping their evade antimissile defenses, they said.\n\n\u201cthe highlights are expected to be the PLA\u2019s strategic nuclear missiles such as the Rocket Force\u2019s land-based DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile, the DF-17 hypersonic missile and the sea-launched JL-2\u201d https://t.co/S7GCThA65G \u2014 Ankit Panda (@nktpnd) September 22, 2019\n\nPeople watching the parade rehearsals took photos of what appeared to be DF-41 missiles, covered by camouflage canvas, on trucks on the streets of central Beijing. But the parade organizers have declined to confirm if the DF-41 missile will appear on Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEveryone please wait and see, and I believe our journalist friends will not be disappointed,\u201d Maj. Gen. Tan Min, one of the commanders of the parade, told reporters.\n\nThe DF-17 hypersonic ballistic missile\n\nThe Dongfeng-17 is a short-to-medium-range missile that can launch a hypersonic glide vehicle, or HGV, which Bondaz and Delory say \u201cwould be a major first.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe emergence of such a system would have a considerable impact, highlighting China's progress in designing hypersonic nonstrategic gliders, a segment in which Russians and Americans are lagging behind,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe missile appears to be capable of exceeding the speed of sound and penetrating U.S. missile shields, and has a maneuverable reentry vehicle, so it could shift targets in flight.\n\nThat would make it less vulnerable to interception by other countries\u2019 defense systems, the South China Morning Post reported, quoting an individual from the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnd the DF-17 will be capable of delivering both nuclear and conventional payloads,\u201d said the individual, who was not named.\n\nAD\n\nWhen China carried out the first tests at the end of 2017, the DF-17 missile successfully completed its ballistic flights and reentered the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, using the HGV during the glide phase, The Diplomat reported at the time. It landed \u201cwithin meters\u201d of its intended target during that test, the website reported, quoting American intelligence sources.\n\nThe DR-8 unmanned aerial vehicle and the Sharp Sword stealth attack drone\n\nPhotos from the parade rehearsals have prompted speculation that it will include two types of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones. China has been heavily investing in drone technologies and making technological advances.\n\nAD\n\nExperts have spotted images of what appears to be a DR-8 reconnaissance drone, which can reach as far into the western Pacific as the American territory of Guam, but has been in service for some time.\n\nAD\n\nMore concerning is the Sharp Sword, an attack drone that is not just at UAV but a UCAV: an unmanned combat air vehicle. The aircraft can carry missiles or laser-guided bombs. It expected to enter service before the end of the year.\n\n\"Australia will need to rethink the task of defending our air space.\" | @LowyInstitute's @SamRoggeveen: https://t.co/TbI9FQcqOo \u2014 The Lowy Institute (@LowyInstitute) September 27, 2019\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has been using drones armed with missiles and guided bombs for many years in the war against terrorism,\u201d wrote Sam Roggeveen, director of the international security program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney.\n\nThese longer-range aircraft and missiles seem designed with the U.S. military in mind, analysts say.\n\n\u201cThe PLA Rocket Force has placed particular emphasis on developing dangerous long-range anti-ship missiles that can keep the U.S. Navy at a safe distance,\u201d the Defense Talk industry publication reported, \u201cso the Sharp Sword\u2019s ability to further extend that range only places enemy ships in all the more peril.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJ-20 stealth fighter jets\n\nThe PLA Air Force recently released video of seven J-20s flying in formation, prompting speculation they would fly over Tiananmen Square as part of the parade.\n\n\u201cTo truly achieve peace, defending our homeland is not enough. We must not only defend but attack,\u201d said Yang Wei, the J-20's chief designer, in the video.\n\nThe Chengdu J-20, China\u2019s first multirole stealth fighter, is designed for enhanced stealth and maneuverability.

They would be able to strike enemy targets deep in hostile territory, he said.\n\nDesigned for enhanced stealth and maneuverability, the J-20 has the potential to provide China with a variety of previously unavailable air combat options and enhance its capability to project power, according to the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nThe Pentagon says China views stealth technology as a core component in the transformation of its air force from \u201ca predominantly territorial air force to one capable of conducting both offensive and defensive operations.\u201d\n\nThe H-6N, a new bomber\n\nThe H-6N, a new version of China\u2019s long-range strategic bomber, also appeared during parade rehearsals. But photos of the H-6N posted on Weibo, China\u2019s answer to Twitter, appeared to show it did not have a bomb bay, causing analysts to wonder if it had been deleted from the photos.\n\nFor the first time the H-6N's underside is clearly visible ... and it seems as if indeed the bomb bay is deleted. \ud83e\udd14\n\n\n\nBut there is not the reported/rumoured semi-conformal bay to hold that use ballistic anti-ship missile. pic.twitter.com/gCDjjErGav \u2014 @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) September 22, 2019\n\nThe photos did, however, show large, visible missiles mounted on the bomber. The War Zone blog suggested these could be DF-21 anti-ship ballistic missiles, which it said would give the bomber \u201can impressive standoff capability against large enemy warships, especially aircraft carriers.\u201d\n\nOther observers noted the bomber had an aerial refueling receptacle. That will enable the aircraft, which was modeled on the Soviet Tu-16 jet bomber, to carry out in-flight refueling \u2014 significantly boosting its operating range compared to its predecessor, the H-6K the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nAnd finally all three so far known H-6N from the CTC Bomber Brigade\n\n\n\n(via @MinorLogan) pic.twitter.com/3RzJkIk1J4 \u2014 @Rupprecht_A (@RupprechtDeino) September 22, 2019\n\nType 15 tanks\n\nChina\u2019s lightweight Type 15 tank also looks set to make an appearance in the parade. The tanks have been commissioned by the Chinese military, according to China\u2019s latest national defense white paper, and will appear in public for the first time at Tuesday\u2019s parade.\n\nIt is armed with a fully stabilized 105mm rifled gun and an effective firing range of two miles. The tank weighs between 33 and 36 tons, making it more mobile than a standard battle tank, which usually weight about 50 tons.\n\n\u201cMobility and rapid redeployment is the key factor of this new combat vehicle. It is intended mainly for reconnaissance and infantry support operations,\u201d according to Military Today. \u201cIt can be airdropped and operate in areas, such as mountains, jungles and river regions, that are not accessible to heavier main battle tanks.\u201d", "description": "From long range ballistic missiles to hypersonic drones, China's military appears to be reaching the level of its American and Russian counterparts.", "authors": ["Anna Fifield", "Beijing Bureau Chief."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uP-xQE3uCvutHILr6xduqinviVI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CFFFA4XBWUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
