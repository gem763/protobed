A new statement from Rooney, in which she details the honeytrap she laid out to catch the alleged culprit, has transfixed the internet in the U.K. and beyond \u2014 you don\u2019t need to be well-versed in British tabloid culture (and the celebrities it tracks) to appreciate the modern-day detective work at play.\n\n\u201cFor a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing THE SUN newspaper of my private posts and stories,\u201d Rooney, who has long battled tabloid exposes, most famously detailing her husband\u2019s infidelities, wrote in a statement shared to her Twitter and Instagram accounts. She then laid out the lengths she went to identify the person she claims is responsible. Do take notes.\n\nTo figure out and prove who the informer was, Rooney explained that she blocked everyone with access to her private Instagram from viewing her stories \u2014 except for one account owned by the person Rooney wrote she had become suspicious of. Rooney then posted a number of fake stories that would only be visible to the one account not blocked.\n\n\u201cOver the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did!\u201d Rooney wrote. \u201cI have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u2026.Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u201d\n\nRebekah Vardy attends the 2018 TRIC Awards at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London.

Vardy is well-known for her appearances on the British daytime talk show Loose Women, and also for taking part in the 2017 series of the very popular British reality show I\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out Of Here!\n\nRooney said that the false details she shared included her a story on her researching \u201cgender selection\u201d treatment in Mexico, another on her considering a return to TV hosting, and one about something as mundane as the basement in her home flooding. Articles on all these subjects have been published in The Sun \u2014 one in August about \u201cgender selection\u201d treatment in Mexico,\u201d one in September about Rooney\u2019s supposed revived TV career and one in October about her house flooding.\n\nA representative for The Sun says the publication does not have a comment on the matter, but pointed TIME to its own coverage of the ongoing fallout between Rooney and Vardy. In that piece, The Sun claims it reached out to Rooney\u2019s representatives for comment on each of the stories she claims Vardy leaked, but that they declined to comment.\n\nVardy was quick to deny Rooney\u2019s accusation. In an Instagram statement of her own, she claimed that other people have had access to her Instagram account and inferred they could/would be the responsible parties. \u201cI\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat would I gain from selling stories?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it had stopped,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI like you a lot Coleen & I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when i\u2019m heavily pregnant.\u201d\n\nRooney\u2019s investigation and conclusion put Twitter in a tizzy Wednesday morning. The Twitter hashtag \u201cWAGatha Christie\u201d \u2014 a portmanteau of the \u201cWAG\u201d nickname and the famed British detective novelist Agatha Christie \u2014 has been trending widely.\n\nWrite to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com.", "description": "In a blockbuster Instagram callout, Coleen Rooney has accused Rebekah Vardy of leaking fake stories about her to the tabloid The Sun", "authors": ["Mahita Gajanan"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/coleen-rooney-rebekah-vardy-tabloid.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
