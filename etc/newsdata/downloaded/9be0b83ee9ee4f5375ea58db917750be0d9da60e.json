These consumers are nonetheless required to migrate to the NBN in order to keep their home service active.\"\n\nThe paper pointed out with NBN discounting being used to get users onto the 50Mbps tier and the creation of new pricing bundles, the government-owned wholesaler required retailers to count bundled services on a separate CVC allowance on each point of interconnect.\n\nThe ACCC said it raised the question of whether the bundles could \"result in discriminatory pricing outcomes contrary to NBN Co's non-discrimination obligations\".\n\nNBN was formally warned last week for discriminating between retail service providers (RSPs) when supplying infrastructure to business customers.\n\nThe ACCC found that from at least January 2018, the company provided Macquarie Telecom with different commercial terms compared to other RSPs.\n\nThe consumer watchdog said on Monday it was concerned that NBN was continually using discounts that it could unilaterally withdraw to adjusting pricing\n\n\"This lack of certainty creates unnecessary risks that may ultimately be passed on to consumers, who may face higher prices and reduced quality and product offerings as a result,\" Sims said.\n\nThe inquiry will also look into the service transfer and reversal fees that NBN charges.\n\nAlthough NBN is looking into its entry level pricing, the ACCC said it would undertake its own inquiry now so that a final access determination could be put in place, if needed, when NBN's current wholesale pricing agreement expires in November 2020.\n\nLast week, Vocus hit out at NBN for the tactics it has used to ramp up its number of enterprise customers, calling on the government to hand the national wholesaler a new statement of expectations.\n\nCEO Kevin Russell said the government should make it so that NBN cannot enter into tenders or contracts with end-users, cannot negotiate buying commitments or terms of service with customers, cannot sign confidentiality agreements with users, nor recommend retailers to enterprise customers.\n\n\"NBN should be a good thing for the Australian Enterprise market -- but only if it operates within its original remit as a wholesale-only, transparent, and non-discriminatory operator,\" Russell said.\n\n\"Right now, NBN's behaviour in the market is in danger of undermining and penalising those who have invested and, want to invest, to support infrastructure competition.\"\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "Regulator worried people cannot get a basic NBN service at the same pricing level as ADSL.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/10/04/b8f7d86f-2190-4549-8b40-4f0c5b7e1866/thumbnail/770x578/b3490c19be4d3e2e83564c4ca8ad9ad0/broadband-cable-telco.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
