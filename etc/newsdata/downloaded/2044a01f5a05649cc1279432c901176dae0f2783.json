I was simply bringing the American people the truth about the Bidens,' he said.\n\n'And that\u2019s not all. I now have reason to believe that the 2016 election was not hacked by the Russians. It was hacked by Hunter Biden, who is actually a \"Men in Black\" style alien being operated by a tiny Hillary Clinton in his neck.'\n\nGiuliani gave his impression of a controlled Hunter Biden as the audience roars.\n\nWhen Colbert asks if Giuliani has proof, he answers: \u2018Oh not yet. Or ever! I\u2019m not falling into that \"proof\" trap.'\n\nAs the segment progresses, Giuliani channels Scooby-Doo when explaining his 'team' and guzzles red wine -his apparent 'Rudy Snack' of choice.\n\nThroughout the segment, Giuliani (pictured) drinks red wine and refers to it as his 'research department'\n\n'It was Gordon Sondland, Rick Perry, Velma and me: Rudy-Rudy-Roooo!'\n\nColbert cuts in to ask for Giuliani's response to former National Security Advisor John Bolton calling him 'a hand grenade who would blow anyone up.'\n\n'That\u2019s crazy! Grenades are used by highly trained soldiers. I\u2019m more like a can of hairspray someone turns into a flame thrower during a prison riot,' Giuliani answers confidently.\n\nThat's when Giuliani begins to list all the major players, besides Hunter Biden, in his conspiracy theories. 'Everyone was in on it: the deep state, Podesta, George Soros.'\n\nGiuliani: 'They're going to fund my space expedition to get to the bottom of Hunter Biden's business deal with the Nazi's in the center of the moon'\n\nGiuliani stops 'consult [his] research department' and takes another sip of wine.\n\n'The lizard people, bigfoot, the chupacabra.'\n\nTrump's attorney ends his interview by donning an astronaut helmet, saying he is 'counter-counter investigating' his critics with his new Bulgarian team 'certified rip-off.'\n\n'They're going to fund my space expedition to get to the bottom of Hunter Biden's business deal with the Nazi's in the center of the moon!'\n\nHunter Biden (pictured) has become a target for the Trump administration and republicans who are outraged by the impeachment scandal\n\nOutside of the political comedy sphere, the real Rudy Giuliani has become embroiled in the Ukraine impeachment saga.\n\nOn October 9, two Ukraine fixers identified as Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were arrested for allegedly funneling foreign money into U.S. campaigns.\n\nTheir arrest was related to a $325,000 donation to a group supporting Trump's re-election in 2020.\n\nDuring Giuliani's visits to Ukraine, it's reported that he met with Ukrainian officials in an attempt to prove that the Biden family used their influence to stop corruption investigations.\n\nRudy Giuliani (pictured) has become part of the Ukraine impeachment scandal after two 'fixers' were arrested on campaign finance violations\n\nFormally, Parnas and Fruman were arrested on charges including conspiracy, making false statements to the Federal Election Commission and falsification of records.\n\nThis indictment marks the first criminal charges related to the Ukraine controversy.\n\nThings have not gotten better for Giuliani as Gordon Sondland, United States Ambassador to the European Union, has turned on the Trump administration in the impeachment scandal.\n\nSondland said before Congress that the president directed him to work with Giuliani on Ukraine.\n\nDuring his testimony he affirmed that Trump allegedly refused to meet with the Ukrainian president until they spoke to Giuliani about investigating into the Bidens.\n\nRick Perry (left) and Gordon Sondland (right) have both been tied to Giuliani after news of the President Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian president became public\n\nSondland said in a statement: 'Based on the President's direction, we were faced with a choice: We could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky, which we all believed was crucial to strengthening U.S.-Ukrainian ties and furthering long-held U.S. foreign policy goals in the region.'\n\n'Or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President's concerns\n\nUnited States Secretary of Energy Rick Perry is also wrapped up in the mix with Giuliani.\n\nPerry has publicly defended himself for speaking with Giuliani about Ukraine and didn't see anything wrong with the action.\n\nHe reportedly reached out at Trump's behest, signalling how closely Giuliani worked with the administration on Ukraine policy.\n\nPerry told the Wall Street Journal: 'I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m working at the will of the president, just like I always have.'", "description": "Actor John Lithgow appeared on 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' and debuted his wine-guzzling, wild conspiracy spouting Rudy Giuliani on Tuesday night during a segment", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/16/20088290-0-image-a-25_1571842923733.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
