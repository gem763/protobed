(AP) - The newest state park in Kansas is slated to open next month.\n\nLittle Jerusalem Badlands State Park in Logan County is a rare geological gem that features chalky spires and buttes projecting as high as 100 feet (30 meters) in the air.\n\nThe Wichita Eagle reports that the park is set to open Oct. 12. The park\u2019s grand opening ceremony will be followed by free, guided tours that run every hour.\n\nKansas dropped a $50 visitor\u2019s fee last month. The fee had been intended as a warning to anyone that might damage the park\u2019s fragile rock formations.\n\nTours will now be free, but visitors must schedule them in advance.\n\nGuests will be required to buy a $5 state park vehicle permit or have a yearly Kansas state parks vehicle pass.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Wichita (Kan.)
