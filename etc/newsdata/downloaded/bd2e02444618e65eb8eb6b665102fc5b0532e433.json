(In) China there is no real recovery in sight so far,\" Diess told CNBC's Annette Weisbach at the Frankfurt Motor Show on Monday.\n\nDiess said the firm was largely managing to defend its market share through clever marketing and was also being helped by slowly increasing sales in the United States.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, the U.S. has threatened a series of global tariffs which would have a negative effect on European carmakers. The most obvious is the threat to raise import tariffs on foreign cars, although Trump has delayed his decision on the issue.\n\nIn June, Diess reportedly met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the specific impact of U.S. tariffs on Mexican made goods, which directly affect VW manufacture in the Americas. VW Group also has a substantive presence in China, Trump's main target for tariffs.\n\nDiess said Monday that tariffs don't \"make our life easier\" and the German firm depended on low trade barriers to maintain margins. He added that VW would like to see the trade threats \"go away\" in the coming months but didn't expect that to be the case.\n\nSpeaking at the same event, Oliver Blume, the CEO of VW-owned Porsche, said it was carefully monitoring the geopolitical situation.\n\n\"We are observing very deeply what is happening in the U.S., with all the conflicts on the global market. Also in England what they are doing there. And we are prepared with different scenarios,\" he told CNBC.\n\n\"But on the other hand we have a very huge fan base in the U.S. with a lot of Porsche clubs. So we are very confident to continue with a very good business in the U.S. But it's a serious topic.\"", "description": "Herbert Diess tells CNBC that sales in the United States are improving slightly but China's slowdown continues.", "authors": ["David Reid"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105153344-GettyImages-653199454.jpg?v=1566479451", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
