Prices opened with a sharp gap (read price void) to the downside. This is one of the largest gaps I can remember. Prices have moved still lower from the opening which tells us that prices have yet to reach a level where \"bargain hunters\" might enter.\n\nWe looked at the charts of ULTA on Thursday and noted that \"with mixed bar charts and a bullish Point and Figure chart things are not clear. The one clue that is disturbing in the flat OBV line -- no one seems to be taking an aggressive stance. Avoid for now.\"\n\nHopefully you did not get caught wrong footed on ULTA. Where could we be headed now? Let's check out our updated charts.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of ULTA, below, we can see the huge downside gap and the surge in trading volume. Every potential support level this year has been broken.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has turned down to a new low for the move and so has the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of ULTA, below, we have to use our imagination as today's price action is not yet included. Prices will be below the 40-week moving average line and closer to the December nadir.\n\nThe weekly OBV line should drop sharply and the MACD oscillator should be closer to the zero line.\n\nIn this updated Point and Figure chart of ULTA, below, we can see the plunge with all the prices filled in which is part of the methodology of this charting technique. A still lower price target of $133 is being forecast. Ouch.\n\nBottom line strategy: My first teacher of technical analysis - Ralph Acampora, CMT - used to say \"if you throw garbage down hard enough it can bounce\". This comment was cute during the 1973-74 bear market. ULTA could bounce once more as longs are flushed out probably at a lower level from here. This stock will need a long repair process.
