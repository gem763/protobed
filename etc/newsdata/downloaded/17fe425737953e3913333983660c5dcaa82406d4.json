On Monday, Erdogan said U.S. troops had started to withdraw after a phone call he had with Trump, adding that talks between Turkish and U.S. officials on the matter would continue.\n\nOn Tuesday, a U.S. official said U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley took part in the phone call, but the official did not provide further details.\n\n\u201cGiven the likely military issues raised on the call between (Trump) and President Erdogan, Secretary of Defense Esper and Chairman Milley participated on the call,\u201d said the official.\n\nEarlier, the Pentagon said Esper and Milley had been consulted by Trump \u201cover the last several days\u201d about a possible Turkish strike in Syria.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Turkey has chosen to act unilaterally. As a result we have moved the U.S. forces in northern Syria out of the path of potential Turkish incursion to ensure their safety,\u201d U.S. Defense Department spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement.\n\nOVERNIGHT STRIKE\n\nA Turkish security official said one of the main goals of the overnight strike was to cut off a transit route between Iraq and Syria often used by Kurdish armed groups \u201cbefore the operation in Syria\u201d.\n\nIt was unclear what damage was done or whether there were casualties. Details of the strike, a joint operation by Turkey\u2019s intelligence service and the military, were hazy. One official described them as an air strike, while the other said the site was made \u201cunusable through various means\u201d.\n\nTrump denied he had abandoned the Kurdish forces, the most effective U.S. partners in fighting Islamic State in Syria. But he praised Turkey as a trade partner, in a softening of tone hours after threatening to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it acted \u201coff limits\u201d in Syria.\n\nAmid deepening humanitarian concerns, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all parties in northeast Syria to exercise maximum restraint and protect civilians.\n\nSignalling a further potential shift in the region\u2019s power balance, the Kurdish-led forces said they might start talks with the Syrian government and Russia to fill a security vacuum in the event of a full U.S. withdrawal.\n\nTurkey sought to underscore its determination to act. \u201cThe TSK will never tolerate the establishment of a terror corridor on our borders. All preparations for the operation have been completed,\u201d the Turkish Defence Ministry said.\n\nTurkish army howitzers are positioned on the Turkish-Syrian border, near the southeastern town of Akcakale in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 7, 2019. REUTERS/Stringer\n\nROCKET SYSTEMS\n\nNear the Turkish border town of Akcakale, across from Syria\u2019s Tel Abyad, a Reuters witness saw howitzers placed behind earth embankments on Turkey\u2019s side of the border, pointed towards Syria.\n\nSome 60 km (40 miles) to the west, multiple launch rocket systems mounted on two trucks were deployed behind earth embankments near Suruc, opposite the Syrian border town of Kobani. Artillery was also stationed in the area, and soldiers wandered around a nearby military camp.\n\nTrump\u2019s warning on Turkey\u2019s economy on Monday appeared aimed at placating critics who accused him of abandoning the Syrian Kurds. Democrats criticised his withdrawal decision, as did some of his fellow Republicans in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nHis remarks, reiterated on Tuesday in slightly modified form, met an angry response in Turkey, including from opposition party politicians such as Iyi Party leader Meral Aksener.\n\n\u201cThreatening Turkey\u2019s economy is a diplomatic catastrophe,\u201d she told her party\u2019s lawmakers in a speech in parliament. \u201cThe best response to this insolence is to go into the east of the Euphrates and break the terror corridor.\u201d\n\nBut on Tuesday, Trump tweeted: \u201cSo many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States ... They have been good to deal with.\u201d\n\nThe Kurdish-led forces have denounced the major U.S. policy shift as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d.\n\nMustafa Bali of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the Turkish military buildup on the border, together with information about further mobilisation of Turkey-backed Syrian rebels, indicated that \u201can attack is imminent\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from northeast Syria has rattled allies, including France, one of Washington\u2019s main partners in the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State.\n\nRussia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s strongest foreign ally, said it was not told in advance by Washington or Turkey about any agreements to pull U.S. troops.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin met with Russia's security council on Tuesday. \"Participants of the meeting have noted that, at this stage, it was important for everyone to avoid any action that could create obstacles to a peaceful settlement in Syria,\" the Kremlin said on its website.
