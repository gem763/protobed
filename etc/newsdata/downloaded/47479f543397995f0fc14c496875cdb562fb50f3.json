He has decided that Russia needs an enemy, and it\u2019s the United States. And it\u2019s part of his domestic strategy also to hold his country together at a time when the economy is suffering, when people are starting to get a little tired of his leadership.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
