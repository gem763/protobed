I feel we have to change that. We have to move forward.'\n\nAsked what is the worst part of the disease, he said Lady Helen is no longer able to walk.\n\nHe said: 'I think the memory thing is the least of it, but walking is no longer possible. Memory is something we can handle.'\n\nThe Scotsman previously said his wife, whom he married 57 years ago, receives 24-hour care and still enjoys being 'cuddled and kissed' but fears that even her long-term memory of their time together will soon disappear.\n\nSir Jackie has also described his wife's dementia as 'the greatest challenge of my life'.\n\nThe racing driver, who won the F1 world championship three times, said caring for a dementia patient is twice as expensive as caring for someone with cancer.\n\nHe said: 'In these past 30 years, however much has been put into it, there are no cures.\n\nSir Jackie (pictured live today from his home in Geneva), 80, had his world turned upside down when his wife Lady Helen was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2016\n\n'Even in the NHS in our country and the UK, you don't have enough money to be able to care for them, in hospitals and in homes. We have a major problem with it.'\n\nSir Jackie revealed he is investing \u00a33.75million into funding five PHD students looking into dementia care.\n\nHe said: 'I truly believe there are no problems, only solutions.\n\n'We have great skills in the UK and around the world \u2013 it's a global problem. But we're going to have to move forward faster than we have in the past.'\n\nHelen was first diagnosed three years ago after she couldn't remember how a car accident happened in the grounds of the couple's lavish Chiltern Hills estate.\n\nNow based full-time in Geneva, Lady Helen is cared for around the clock by a team of eight neuroscience nurses and the four-storey house the couple share on the banks of Lake Geneva has been kitted out with state-of-the-art technology.", "description": "Sir Jackie, 80, had his world turned upside down when his wife Lady Helen was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia by US doctors in 2016.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/10/19732092-0-image-a-4_1571131207856.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
