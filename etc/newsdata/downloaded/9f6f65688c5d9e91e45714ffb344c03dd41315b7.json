New study says galleries are lacking in female animal exhibits", "language": "en", "text": "Nature exhibits in museums are \u2018biased\u2019 toward male animals and that\u2019s bad for science, argue the authors of a new study suggesting human \u2018sexism\u2019 carries over to the animal kingdom.\n\nLooking at over two million specimens found in collections at five museums around the world, the researchers found exhibits were skewed toward the boys, and concluded that equal representation for their lady counterparts would assist scientists in their studies.\n\n\u201cWe suspected that some bias towards males would be found because science is done by people, and people have inherent biases towards males,\u201d Natalie Cooper, the main author of the study, told AFP, adding: \u201cBy ignoring females, we don't get a full picture of life.\u201d\n\nPublished in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B journal on Wednesday, the research shows males in museum mammal collections slightly outnumbered the females by two percent, while avian exhibits were 60 percent male, despite females generally outnumbering males in many animal populations.\n\nAlso on rt.com Racism, sexism accusations are \u2018nonsense,\u2019 characters just \u2018products of their time\u2019 \u2013 Tarantino\n\nWhile the collections were constructed over a long time span, between 1751 and 2018, Cooper said she was surprised to find the male-to-female ratio did not become more equal over time, as one might expect as views on gender shift toward egalitarianism around the world.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, we see no improvement. Even recent collections are biased,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nThe study noted a possible alternative explanation for the skewed ratio between genders in exhibits, however, observing that in some species males may be larger and more conspicuous, and therefore easier to collect. Animals with \u201cornaments\u201d \u2013 such as antlers, tusks or bright feather plumes \u2013 might also be more attractive to collectors, and those features are more common among males.\n\nBut whether it's caused by mankind\u2019s bigotry, or merely our innate infatuation with big, colorful things, Cooper said more female exhibits could benefit science and bring a \u201cpositive change\u201d regardless.\n\nAlso on rt.com Everyday sexism can damage women\u2019s health \u2013 study\n\nLike this story?
