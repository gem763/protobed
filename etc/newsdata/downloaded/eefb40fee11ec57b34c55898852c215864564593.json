It reworks the iconic argyles and jacquards of Pringle to make it more youthful and sporty, which we love. It also features the biggest colours of the season; grey and neon green.\n\nThe range is part of H&M\u2019s Conscious collection, meaning each item has been made with recycled polyester and organic cotton \u2013 bonus.\n\nWe love a knitted co-ord (Picture: H&M)\n\nThe cuteness is too much (Picture: H&M)\n\nSo chic (Picture: H&M)\n\nThe most stylish pup in the park (Picture: H&M)\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a brand has released matching outfits for humans and their dogs.
