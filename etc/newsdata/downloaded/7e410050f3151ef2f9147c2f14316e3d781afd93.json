(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen M\u00f3nica Hern\u00e1ndez told her husband that her 2019 New Year\u2019s resolution was to go back to work, he was surprised. He kept asking her if that\u2019s what she really wanted to do. She had been out of the workforce for a year after a difficult pregnancy and the birth of their first child.\n\n\u201cI want to put my brain to use,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez told her husband. \u201cNow my son is here, and it makes me want to do even more.\u201d\n\nHern\u00e1ndez, 28, landed a job this spring as a part-time receptionist at Impressions Pediatric Therapy in Maryland, making her part of a surge of Hispanic and African American women who are entering the workforce amid one of the hottest labor markets in U.S. history.\n\nToday, she earns $15 an hour, a big jump from the $9-an-hour cashier jobs she once thought would be her working life. Clients like that Hern\u00e1ndez is bilingual, and the owner of the fast-growing therapy practice just offered her a full-time position.\n\nThe surge of minority women getting jobs has helped push the U.S. workforce across a historic threshold. For the first time, most new hires of prime working age (25 to 54) are people of color, according to a Washington Post analysis of data the Labor Department began collecting in the 1970s. Minority hires overtook white hires last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen are predominantly driving this trend, which is so powerful that even many women who weren\u2019t thinking about working \u2014 because they were in school, caring for kids or at home for other reasons \u2014 are being lured into employment, according to The Post\u2019s analysis.\n\nMinority women began to pour into the labor market in 2015, and they have begun to reshape the demographics of the U.S. workforce, especially because many white baby boomers have been retiring. There are 5.2 million more people in the United States with jobs than at the end of 2016, and 4.5 million of them are minorities, according to The Post\u2019s analysis of Labor Department.\n\nNow, the question is whether minority groups will hold on to these gains as the economy shows signs of fraying. Job growth is slowing this year, the Labor Department reported Friday, giving rise to fears that a trade war and global economic slowdown that have already hit U.S. economic growth could begin to restrict hiring.\n\nTrump frequently celebrates the recent record lows in the Hispanic and African American unemployment rates, one of his favorite talking points as he makes the economy a central argument for re-election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of gains in employment among lower-income and lower-education groups,\u201d said Marianne Wanamaker, an economist and former member of President Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cBut it is precisely those groups that are vulnerable to layoffs if economic activity slows.\u201d\n\nPoliticians and top policymakers, including at the Federal Reserve, say it\u2019s critical to keep this economic expansion going so more Americans can get jobs \u2014 and build financial security. And it\u2019s especially critical for many minority families, who usually earn less and have far less wealth than whites.\n\nA typical white family has a net worth of over $170,000, while a typical African American or Latino family has a net worth under $21,000, Fed data show.\n\n\u201cPeople who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that this job market is the best anyone can recall,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said in a speech last month in Jackson, Wyo. \u201cOur challenge now is to do what monetary policy can do to sustain the expansion so that the benefits of the strong jobs market extend to more of those still left behind.\u201d\n\n\n\njobs\n\nEconomists say the minority hiring boom is explained mainly by a tight labor market that is forcing employers to look beyond their normal pool of candidates. But interviews with more than 30 new hires, their managers and caseworkers who help people find jobs suggest other forces, such as cultural attitudes and educational attainment, are pushing up the supply of minority women in the work world.\n\nMany Latino women today say their families encourage them to work outside the home, a major change from when their mothers and grandmothers were expected to remain home with kids.\n\n\u201cCulturally, our role was to stay home and take care of the children,\u201d said Frances Villagran-Glover, vice president of student services at Northern Virginia Community College, which has seen Hispanic enrollment double in the past decade. \u201cBut that mind-set is changing. And as women go into the workforce, they see opportunities for leadership and growth.\u201d\n\n\n\nM\u00f3nica Hern\u00e1ndez says goodbye to her son for the afternoon as her brother Felix Hern\u00e1ndez watches him while she goes to work. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nVillagran-Glover and other experts say more women are also getting jobs because families need two incomes to pay rent and other bills. Minority women over age 45 have been some of the biggest job gainers now that their children are older.\n\nDeportation efforts by the Obama and Trump administrations may also be a factor causing more females to seek employment. More than 90 percent of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests are of men, according to the Migration Policy Institute.\n\n\u201cWe see women entering the workforce because their husbands may no longer be in the country,\u201d said Samantha Sherman, chief program officer at Wesley Community Center in Houston that offers employment coaching.\n\nFour years ago, Milagros Tasayco immigrated to Manassas, Va., from Peru with her family after she was able to get a green card. She knew almost no English and stayed home with her two children while her husband, an American citizen, ran a mechanic shop.\n\nAnother mom at the school bus stop told her about low-cost English classes at Hogar Immigrant Services, a community center in a Manassas strip mall that\u2019s run by Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Arlington.\n\nTasayco, 49, enrolled in the beginners course and eventually branched out to computer classes, a CPR course and a certificate program in child development offered by Hogar and Penn State Extension\u2019s Better Kid Care. As Tayasco\u2019s English improved, her husband\u2019s health deteriorated. He was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s. Ultimately, he had to close his business.\n\nTasayco, a former social worker in Peru who hadn\u2019t worked in years, had to become her family\u2019s breadwinner. She found a job in the summer of 2018 at Macy\u2019s stocking shelves for $9 an hour, but she longed to work with children again. In the spring, with the help of Hogar, she got a job as an recreational aid in the preschool classroom at Manassas Park Community Center for $10 an hour.\n\n\u201cNow there are more job opportunities, I think. I look for jobs that want English and Spanish speakers,\u201d said Tasayco, who spends her mornings at the community center and her afternoons at a private day care. \u201cMy children say, \u2018Wow Mommy, you have two jobs!\u2019 My husband is proud, too.\u201d\n\n\n\nHern\u00e1ndez arrives at Impressions Pediatric Therapy, where she works as a receptionist. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nJob postings containing terms such as \u201cfluent in Spanish,\u201d \u201cSpanish required\u201d or \u201cSpanish preferred\u201d have nearly doubled since 2017, according to the job site Indeed.\n\nArely Angel, the lead preschool teacher at the Manassas Park Community Center, liked Tasayco as soon as they met at a job fair. Angel was looking for someone mature who could grow quickly into a leadership role. Tayasco\u2019s social work degree and her Spanish were an asset for a school where about half the students are bilingual or speak Spanish as a first language.\n\nTayasco\u2019s family is no longer on food stamps, but they still struggle. Angel has urged her to earn additional qualifications.\n\n\u201cI want to learn to be a nurse to help children more and maybe get a better job,\u201d Tasayco said. \u201cI love working with kids.\u201d\n\nMore than any other population, Latinos made huge strides to further their education when jobs were scarce after the Great Recession, making them more attractive to employers.\n\nAbout 72 percent of Hispanic Americans over age 25 have high school diplomas, up from 59 percent in 2006, according to the Education Department. And college enrollment among Hispanics has tripled since 1996.\n\n\n\nHern\u00e1ndez interprets for Spanish-speaking patients.

(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nHern\u00e1ndez credits the Training Source, a Maryland nonprofit, for transforming her life. She was unemployed from 2014 to 2016. Despite sending out r\u00e9sum\u00e9s daily, she couldn\u2019t get past the phone interview stage.\n\nAs she browsed Indeed for cashier and barista jobs \u2014 anything that didn\u2019t list strict qualifications beyond her high school degree \u2014 an ad popped up offering free certified nursing assistant (CNA) training near her home in Clinton. She feared it was a scam, but she dialed the number and connected with the Training Source, which helped her acquire everything from a CNA license to an interview-appropriate wardrobe.\n\n\u201cI still have my notes from the professionalism course they provided,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cThey taught me how to be more confident and outgoing.\u201d\n\nThe Training Source has been around for more than 25 years, but it only started offering a course for people to obtain geriatric nursing assistant (GNA) and CNA licenses in 2014. The program is free because of a state government grant, one that could be on the chopping block in a recession.\n\nCompanies and labor unions have also stepped up their outreach to minorities and have their own training programs. Labor Department figures show employers started 3,229 new apprenticeship programs last year \u2014 almost double the rate in 2016. Part of the jump may be due to companies feeling the need to grow talent from within and the Trump administration\u2019s push to formally register apprenticeship programs.\n\nSuriana Rodriguez, 19, is earning about $40,000 a year as an apprentice lab technician in IBM\u2019s office in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., a step on the career ladder that her family members say wouldn\u2019t have been available at their Mexican restaurant.\n\nLast year, she graduated with both a high school diploma and associate degree, part of a new program IBM helped create eight years ago called P-Tech (Pathway to Technology Early College High School), which aims to get more people from disadvantaged backgrounds into tech. This fall, 93,000 students in 10 states are enrolled in P-Tech programs.\n\n\u201cI want to make my family proud, especially my mom,\u201d said Rodriguez, who is the first in her family to earn a college degree and was just offered a full-time IBM job with higher pay. \u201cMy mom took a chance on bringing me to the United States at such a young age.\u201d\n\nOn graduation day, Rodriguez\u2019 mom brought her blue and gold balloons, telling her they symbolized how she could \u201cgo beyond the sky.\u201d For Rodriguez, the main hurdle now is that she\u2019s part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration program, which Congress and the Trump administration have left in limbo.\n\nThese women \u2014 Rodriguez, Hern\u00e1ndez and Tasayco \u2014 were not in the workforce three years ago. They credit local programs with helping them launch new careers. They have been telling their sisters and friends to also get credentials to open doors to better-paying jobs, but they know the programs they went through have limited spots \u2014 and funding can evaporate at any time.\n\n\u201cI try to advise my peers to take a risk and get out there,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cI have a CNA title under my name. I am proud of it. I\u2019m moving in the right direction.\u201d", "description": "Long sidelined, black and Hispanic women are jumping into the workforce.
