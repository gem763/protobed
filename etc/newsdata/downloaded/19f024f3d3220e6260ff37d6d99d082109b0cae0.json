Sign up here to get it nightly.\n\nFiona Apple rarely leaves her house, which is why she\u2019s yet to see Hustlers, the movie that features a be-sequined Jennifer Lopez pole-dancing to Apple\u2019s beloved 1996 anthem \u201cCriminal.\u201d \u201cListen, I just want to say: I would give my song to Jennifer Lopez to dance to for free, any day, any time,\u201d laughs Apple. \u201cI really want to see the movie. If I were a person who actually left my house, I\u2019d go.\u201d She\u2019s been reclusive for a reason, though: She\u2019s hard at work on a new album that was supposed to be done \u201ca million years ago,\u201d and is finally, hopefully, maybe going to be released into the world next year. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know!\u201d she tells me over the phone from her home in Los Angeles. \u201cI go off and I take too long making stuff. It\u2019s hard to say.\u201d\n\nHow I ended up on the phone with Fiona Apple, talking about J.Lo and Apple\u2019s career and Neil Portnow and insomnia remedies, is nearly as difficult to explain. Shortly after Hustlers premiered, I received an email from someone claiming to be Fiona Apple, who\u2019d found my information on my personal website and was emailing from a nondescript Hotmail address. Part of me was suspicious and part of me was eager to believe: Of course Fiona Apple wouldn\u2019t employ a publicist; of course Fiona Apple would have a nondescript Hotmail address. Apple got straight to her point. \u201cI saw that you were one of the only ones to notice what Variety\u2019s Twitter did with that Lorene Scafaria interview,\u201d she wrote, referring to a recent and bizarre incident involving the Hustlers director. During the interview, Scafaria applauded Apple\u2019s decision to donate two years of royalties from \u201cCriminals\u201d to an organization that assists refugees. Except in the video initially tweeted by Variety, Scafaria\u2019s use of the word refugees was dubbed over, rather nonsensically, to imply that Apple is donating royalties \u201cto the movie.\u201d After Scafaria called out the dubbing, Variety scrubbed the original video from the internet and reposted it with corrected audio, calling the misstep a \u201cglitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey overdubbed the word \u2018REFUGEES,\u2019\u201d Apple continued. \u201cNo one seems to think this is a big deal, but I think it is, and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ll write something about it. Email me if you want to talk.\u201d\n\nA few days later, I hopped on the phone with her, assuming we\u2019d discuss the incident and go our separate ways. Instead, she happily remained on the line for 45 minutes, discussing, well, whatever she wanted to discuss. Apple has always done things on her own terms; so much of her mythos is tied to her refusal to play by the rules. She releases music on her own schedule \u2014 only four albums, roughly one every six to seven years, since 1996. She hasn\u2019t done a conventional interview in years; when she was profiled back in 2012, by this very magazine, she smoked hash out of a Champagne flute while musing about human compassion. The Apple I spoke to sounded happy and more grounded than most nonfamous people I know. She signed her email with a balloon emoji. Before our phone conversation ended, she trilled lightly, \u201cKeep in touch!\u201d And she meant it. A few days later, she texted to say she \u201cforgot to tell her J.Lo story,\u201d then proceeded to divulge incredible details about Lopez\u2019s \u201cbeautiful ass.\u201d Below is our sprawling conversation (lightly edited for clarity), text addenda and all.\n\nA selfie. Photo: Courtesy of Fiona Apple\n\nFrom your perspective, what is happening with the Variety video?\n\nI can\u2019t be sure, really. Scott Hechinger from Brooklyn Defender Services sent me that video. And I was like, \u201cWhat the hell is that? It looks overdubbed. Why is she saying, \u2018[She\u2019s also now giving all of the money she makes from \u201cCriminal\u201d] to the movie?\u2019 \u201d I sent it to my manager and my lawyer, and they were like, \u201cYeah, it looks like it\u2019s really overdubbed.\u201d They got in touch with Variety, and Variety took it down. [They] called it a technical glitch. But you saw it. That didn\u2019t look like a technical glitch.\n\nWhat do you think the motive would be for overdubbing the word refugees?\n\nI can only guess they don\u2019t want to alienate any viewers, any ticket buyers, who may be more on the other side of things [politically]. The only reason I can think of is money. But I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cThey\u201d meaning the studio? [Editor\u2019s note: When reached for comment, STX Films, the studio behind Hustlers, declined to comment. In a statement to Vulture, Variety maintained that the incident was a \u201ctechnical audio issue\u201d and said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d to suggest otherwise.]\n\nI get that that\u2019s how studios think, but they could have just taken out the whole sentence. They didn\u2019t have to say I was giving the money to the movie. Who the fuck gives their royalties back to the movie?\n\nI know you don\u2019t do a lot of press. What inspired you to reach out to me about this?\n\nI think this is the first time I\u2019ve ever asked somebody to do an interview. [Laughs.] As my friend Zelda would say, I\u2019m a justice kid. It doesn\u2019t sit right with me that they covered over the word refugees. I don\u2019t want to throw a wet blanket on the movie or anything; Lorene Scafaria is bringing awareness to what sex work is like, and Jennifer Lopez is moving things forward for Latinas and women everywhere. Everyone has something that they care about, and I care about this.\n\nWhen and why did you decide to donate the proceeds from \u201cCriminal\u201d to the organization While They Wait (which provides legal and other services to immigrants in the U.S.)?\n\nI was, like everybody, getting really frustrated. A lot of us want to go down and get these kids out of their cages and give them food and blankets and showers, but there\u2019s no way to fucking get in there. They won\u2019t let you in and they won\u2019t even take donations. I was looking on Twitter, which is unusual for me. I did a Twitter search on immigration and I found [Scott], and this organization made the most sense for me. If I can\u2019t get stuff in there, at least I can try and help them get out of there. When you can help and you want to, it\u2019s really wonderful to do that.\n\nDid you know, at that point, that \u201cCriminal\u201d was going to be in Hustlers?\n\nTo be honest, I really don\u2019t think I remembered that I had given the song to Hustlers. And I was like, \u201cWhoa, I forgot about that! That\u2019s so great.\u201d Basically, every single time any college dancer or So You Think You Can Dance [contestant] asks, I\u2019ll give them the rights. \u201cCriminal\u201d has always been what people ask for the most, so it\u2019s always been my little help-out-people song.\n\nWhat made you decide to license \u201cCriminal\u201d to Hustlers? I know you\u2019ve never given the song to a movie before.\n\nIt was just about what it was and who was in it. But I didn\u2019t know [Jennifer Lopez] was going to be dancing to it. I\u2019ve seen a lot of pieces about how they got [the rights to] \u201cCriminal,\u201d but it\u2019s just funny to me \u2014 there\u2019s a disconnect between agents, because I never got a video of the dance. And I want it, bad! I\u2019m all for the movie, though, and I\u2019m excited to see it.\n\nLorene says she wrote you a letter, too. Did you ever receive it?\n\nI don\u2019t remember receiving a letter from her. But that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying \u2014 there\u2019s some kind of disconnect. I believe her that she wrote me a letter, and that she sent me the scene. But who knows what happened? Maybe somebody in the studio is like, \u201cWe don\u2019t trust that girl with this! Don\u2019t send it to her.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re very discerning about where your songs go. I remember reading that you didn\u2019t let Panic! at the Disco use a sample from The Idler Wheel.\n\nYou know, can I just say something about that, which is funny? I don\u2019t remember hearing the song they wanted to put that in. The reason I didn\u2019t give it to them \u2014 besides the fact that I don\u2019t remember it, so it probably wasn\u2019t that great to me \u2014 is because this other guy had just used a sample of that same song and had signed to my label. He\u2019d already made a big video with that song in the background. So I was like, \u201cHey, what the fuck is going on here?\u201d I ended up giving permission because I didn\u2019t have a choice; they\u2019d already used it in a song and video. And then Panic! at the Disco asked, and I was like, Wow, I can\u2019t believe they even asked me. Usually people just go ahead and use it. [Update: After this interview went up, Apple posted a video on Instagram calling out Lil Nas X for doing just that.] I was just trying to not shit all over somebody else\u2019s sampling of my song by doing it twice, but [Brandon Urie] called me a bitch. Which I think is hilarious.\n\nDid that get to you?\n\nSomebody calling me a bitch? No! It would get to me if I felt like I really was being a bitch, but I don\u2019t know if he really meant it anyway. I just didn\u2019t say yes. I mean, just use a different song. It\u2019s not a big deal. I don\u2019t know anything about him except for this clip. But it did look like he was entertaining himself in this clip, saying it. Like, \u201cYeah, I just said that!\u201d\n\nThat would have made me feel terrible when I was 18, like, oh, one of my peers called me a bitch, and now everybody\u2019s gonna think I\u2019m a bitch, ahhh. Sticks and stones didn\u2019t break my bones, but they fucking bruised me. It\u2019s just words, but words hurt a lot. But now it\u2019s like rhinoceros skin. It\u2019s like somebody shooting arrows at you and they bounce off you. Now it\u2019s like, it doesn\u2019t even track.\n\nHow do you keep up with what people are saying about you? Are you lurking online?\n\nOther people tell me. I\u2019m not online. I don\u2019t have Twitter. I do search things, like when I searched the Hustlers thing \u2026 to see what people are talking about. That\u2019s how I found you.\n\nYou famously wrote \u201cCriminal\u201d in 45 minutes at age 17, after the record label asked for a single. What does the song mean to you as an adult?\n\nRight now the song itself, the lyrics, those don\u2019t really mean anything to me. The way it started, the video, all the crap I got \u2014 using this song now, and using it in this movie for a purpose I believe in, is like reclaiming it. I\u2019m not that scared girl in underwear anymore. The song isn\u2019t that to me anymore. It\u2019s my way of paying for things that I want to get done.\n\nI do remember when the video came out, it was such a flash point for this very specific, male-dominated, shitty discourse \u2014 people fixated on your body and perceived sexuality, using phrases like \u201cheroin chic\u201d and dubbing your performance \u201cpornographic.\u201d What do you think about when you watch the video now?\n\nI haven\u2019t watched the video in a while. I\u2019m still in touch with Mark Romanek [the director], and he\u2019s a great guy and he\u2019s my friend. That was just a situation where everything was set up when I got there. I didn\u2019t have the treatment of how the video was supposed to be. They were expecting somebody to come up and be like, \u201cYeah! I\u2019m sexy! I\u2019m stripping!\u201d versus somebody being like, \u201cI\u2019m sad.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s really interesting in the context of Hustlers, too, because the film is about how women are valued and exploited under capitalism. When I spoke to Lorene and the cast, there was a lot of talk about how the majority of women have \u201cdanced for money,\u201d whether literally or figuratively. Did you ever feel like you had to do that?\n\nWith that video, when they wanted me to do that, they didn\u2019t get the results they wanted. Nobody has really asked me to shake my booty since then. At all. So I think I\u2019ve avoided that. I mean, just the fact that I don\u2019t actually talk to a lot of people means that I avoid getting a lot of annoying [requests]. It\u2019s hard for me to answer stuff about my career experiences because for me, right now, it\u2019s been almost a decade since I\u2019ve been in that career. I forget that that\u2019s my life sometimes.\n\nWhat does your life look like right now?\n\nWell, it is music now, because I\u2019m finishing a record. But that\u2019s all, like, me in my house, and I\u2019m in control of everything. So I don\u2019t have to be getting other people\u2019s ideas of what I should be doing yet.\n\nYou\u2019ve always been good at that \u2014 controlling your own narrative. How did you develop that power?\n\nI don\u2019t even think it\u2019s a power. I do think I\u2019ve always had it. It\u2019s honestly a direct result of me never getting people\u2019s phone numbers and never getting chummy with a lot of people. So then people don\u2019t think of me to call up and badger to come out and do stuff. So I never go out and do stuff, because it\u2019s never expected. My family hasn\u2019t seen me at Christmas celebrations for years and years. So I just don\u2019t get invited anymore. [Laughs.] I mean, that\u2019s an exaggeration.\n\nI assumed in the beginning I could do whatever I want. If you\u2019re just doing that from the beginning, and don\u2019t have any doubt about it, then that\u2019s how it goes. I had no idea I was setting my own narrative by not acting a certain way or taking anybody\u2019s advice.\n\nThat\u2019s what drew so many women I know to you in the first place. We still talk about your 1997 VMA acceptance speech, where you said, \u201cThis world is bullshit.\u201d\n\nThis Variety thing totally made me think, This world is bullshit. And not talking about this entire world, but just the showbiz world.\n\nWhat adjective would you use to describe the world now?\n\nThe world is many, many, many, many things. I never said the world was bullshit, I just said this world was bullshit. Referring to the room that I was in and the whole music scene, which \u2014 it\u2019s not bullshit anymore. It\u2019s the bull who ate that shit and then shit it out again, and then ate that shit and then shit it out again, and then ate that shit and then shit it out again, and then ate that shit and then shit it out again, and now it\u2019s that bullshit. [Laughs loudly.]\n\nThat was \u2026 incredible. What makes that the case?\n\nI have no idea. I just think everybody wants to be a star and everybody is willing to do whatever the fuck it takes to be famous. That means pushing people out of the way and not caring for other causes and only caring for yourself and what your fucking brand is, whatever the fuck that means. I think people are getting more and more selfish. Not all around \u2014 it\u2019s hard to answer big world questions. I don\u2019t know why things are the way they are.\n\nHow do you make new music within that sort of system?\n\nI worry a lot about what it\u2019s gonna be like when I actually have to put out an album and go out there. I think I\u2019m getting close to finishing. While I\u2019m doing it, I have to put the rest of it out of my mind. It\u2019s just fun. It\u2019s just me making stuff, on my own time, and then not making stuff for years, and then starting to make stuff. It\u2019s just around this time when things are starting to shape up with the album and everything is getting toward the finish line \u2014 that\u2019s when I start to get a little concerned for myself. I\u2019ll be okay, I just know that it\u2019s not going to be all enjoyable. Every time I go out on a photo shoot, I think, This is different from seven years ago. I don\u2019t feel like this anymore.\n\nAre you able to detach yourself from the publicity process more than you used to?\n\nNot exactly. I might be able to, but it\u2019s more that I\u2019m like a scientist and curious about how I\u2019m affected by these things at this point in my life. After seven years away, what is she like in this situation now? I\u2019m sort of observing myself, seeing what it\u2019s like.\n\nWhen do you think the album might be ready?\n\nI mean, I don\u2019t know! It\u2019s hard to say. I was supposed to be done a million years ago. And I go off and I take too long making stuff. I\u2019m hoping for early 2020. I think.\n\nThe whole music scene \u2014 it\u2019s not bullshit anymore. It\u2019s the bull who ate that shit and then shit it out again, and then ate that shit and then shit it out again\u2026 and now it\u2019s that bullshit.\n\nCan you compare it to any of your earlier albums? Or does it feel like it\u2019s completely its own thing?\n\nIt\u2019s probably its own thing. But I don\u2019t know how to articulate that. It\u2019s like, if you\u2019ve been working out every day for a month and then nobody sees you, they see the difference, but if you\u2019ve been doing it all the time, you don\u2019t really see the difference. I can\u2019t really know the growth or the evolution or anything like that in what I do, because I\u2019m in the middle of it.\n\nYou take your time between albums. When do you know, okay, it\u2019s time to start making music again?\n\nA lot of times it\u2019s actually because I get kicked in the ass by the musicians I work with. They\u2019re like, \u201cCome on, when are we gonna get back to the album?\u201d I\u2019ve been making this album with my band, and they all have other gigs. They\u2019ve got to make money. When it\u2019s just me recording myself, it\u2019s different, but with the band stuff, you have to wait for everybody to be in town and be able to do it. So that slows things down a bit. And I tend to forget about working after a while. And then be like, \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on? Let\u2019s play, let\u2019s play.\u201d\n\nWhat have you been doing over the past few years when you haven\u2019t been making music?\n\nHmm, what do I do? I mean, I\u2019m always writing in my head. I spend a lot of time with my dog. I live here in my house with my friend Zelda and her dog, and we just hang out. We play with dogs and work on our stuff and go out for walks. I have a very simple life.\n\nFiona and her dog. Photo: Courtesy of Fiona Apple\n\nIn that life, does it make its way to you that you\u2019re something of an icon for your refusal to conform to certain ideas about womanhood? Are you aware of it, and does that get internalized for you?\n\nHearing you say that \u2026 I like the sound of that. I will choose to believe that. I\u2019d like to internalize that. That would be great.\n\nWhen you do leave your house, what\u2019s your relationship like with fame, with your fans? Do you interact with them, do they approach you?\n\nI don\u2019t get approached a lot. I\u2019m not around people enough for it to be a thing. I haven\u2019t noticed anybody notice me in [a long time] \u2026 but when I\u2019m out with people, sometimes they\u2019ll notice me getting noticed. Anytime anyone talks to me, they\u2019re always really nice. Way back at the beginning, I was thinking I could put out a CD and I\u2019d make all of these friends, and I wouldn\u2019t know them but they\u2019d know me, so that when I met them I could just say hello and we\u2019d already be friends \u2014 I think it actually came true in a way. Not that I\u2019m actually friends with everyone I meet. But if you\u2019re intimate with my music, you\u2019re intimate with me and I\u2019m intimate with you. I feel like you\u2019re my friend. Maybe that\u2019s a little bit too childlike, but I do feel like that.\n\nVulture profiled you in 2012 and you had a great quote, which I\u2019ll read to you. The profiler starts: \u201cI assumed she wanted to talk about her album; she said she didn\u2019t care. I told her I thought it was her best work; she said it was funny because she\u2019d run into her ex-boyfriend, the filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson, and \u2018he remembers me as somebody\u2019s who\u2019s been down on themselves from years ago,\u2019 and when he\u2019d asked about the album, she told him she felt \u2018really, really happy, I felt like I can die now, I\u2019ve done what I want, this is me.\u2019\u201d Does that resonate for you now?\n\nYeah. I felt that way after that album, and this is me getting to that place with this one. The last album, it was just me and [producer] Charley Drayton, doing it all ourselves. This time, it\u2019s just me and the band. The more control you have over something, the more it\u2019s your baby, the more you care about it, the more it feels like an accomplishment. The last record and this record feel more like mine than the other records. You know? Not that I don\u2019t feel like the other records are mine.\n\nWhat\u2019s your relationship to your old music? Do you ever listen to it?\n\nNo, no, no. Why would I? Well, I do freak out before I go on the road because I don\u2019t know how to play my songs anymore and I have to relearn all of them. I have some homework.\n\nVulture recently did a long Q&A with Liz Phair, and she said something really interesting: \u201cWhen I\u2019m not working, I safeguard my time to go into a dream state and not have to think about the commercialization of my art or the commodification of myself. I take \u2018Liz Phair,\u2019 I put her on a hanger, kind of like Mr. Rogers, and I put her away in a closet. I\u2019m not \u2018Liz Phair\u2019 anymore.\u201d Do you feel that way?\n\nYeah! I don\u2019t feel like I have a Fiona Apple to take off and put in a closet, like a big persona like that, like I have to click my heels. I don\u2019t have such a public self, so I don\u2019t think I really have to put it away. But I do feel like when I\u2019m not in public, it is like taking off a big heavy coat. And then just being naked by yourself.\n\nDo you think you\u2019d want to spend this much time by yourself if you weren\u2019t famous?\n\nThere\u2019s no way to really tell, but I think so. I mean, when we were trying to come up with my stage name, my mom wanted it to be \u201cFiona Lone.\u201d \u201cBecause you\u2019re always alone!\u201d That was when I was 17, so I\u2019ve been this way for a while. Although I\u2019m actually not alone that much now, because my best friend Zelda lives with me, so we\u2019re around each other all the time. I just don\u2019t have a social need to go out.\n\nYou\u2019ve sung and talked a lot about your inability to sleep, but you mentioned your lucid dreams in a recent Q&A. As a fellow insomniac, I need to know: How\u2019d you solve the sleep issue?\n\nI\u2019ve been through a lot of medication, and for a long time, I think, the medication was helping me sleep and also helping me not have nightmares, but also giving me nightmares. I was on way too much medication for a while. Now I\u2019m on way less medication. But pot helps me. Alcohol helped me for a while, but I don\u2019t drink anymore. Now it\u2019s just pot, pot, pot. And I get up at like 5 a.m. [Laughs.]\n\nI watched the fan Q&A you did on YouTube last year, which was really fun and rare for you. What made you decide to do that? I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve done that before.\n\nNo. Well, I met a fan of mine in the alley of the Largo [in Los Angeles] about five years ago. Her name was Ashley. She wanted to sing part of my song with me, and we sang it, and she was very sweet. We sat down and she told me about Simon, who runs a Tumblr on me [Fiona Apple Rocks]. I\u2019ve stayed in touch with her and I call her my pseudo-daughter. And I stay in touch with Simon now, too. Simon\u2019s my friend now. We talk to each other about nothing to do with his postings. And he said there were a lot of fan questions, and would I do something like that?\n\nCan you tell me the story of giving away your Grammy? You told TMZ in 2017, \u201cI don\u2019t know where it is at this point. I gave it away.\u201d Why, and where is it?\n\nI gave it to this school, and I have to get it sent back. For the longest time it was at somebody\u2019s house and they wouldn\u2019t give it back to me, and I said I was going to give it to my grandmother, but I was really going to donate it to a school so they could auction it off. But it turns out you can\u2019t auction it off. So now it\u2019s in this office in this school, and I haven\u2019t gotten around to writing them to get it back.\n\nWhat do you think about Neil Portnow stepping down as president of the Recording Academy, after he said that women needed to \u201cstep up\u201d as musicians? I loved your Kneel Portnow shirt.\n\nPersonally, I met him a couple times, maybe. I know some people who think he\u2019s a really great guy and didn\u2019t deserve all that flack that people like me gave him. But, I mean \u2014 if you say something like that in the first place, your head\u2019s in the wrong place. That\u2019s not misspeaking, you know? [Laughs.] I don\u2019t have any evil thoughts about the guy, and I made that T-shirt because his name lends itself to that and it was too good not to do. And because I felt that. But you can\u2019t just say something like that and be like, \u201cI love women! I\u2019m doing something for women!\u201d There\u2019s clearly something going on, there\u2019s a problem, when you\u2019re like, \u201cWell, women just need to be better.\u201d\n\nYour work, for a long time, was discussed in tandem with your image, especially by male critics in the \u201990s, who wrote some pretty unfair shit about you. Do you think things have gotten better for women in the industry in that sense?\n\nI\u2019ll have to get back to you once I get into things and see how I\u2019m treated. I think it\u2019s a lot harder to treat women the way they were treated in the \u201990s now because you can get called out so easily on social media. If somebody does something shitty nowadays, a 17-year-old singer can get on their social media and say, \u201cLook what this fucker did! It\u2019s fucked up.\u201d Like when Taylor Swift said, \u201cYou took my music and I didn\u2019t get a chance to buy it,\u201d and was able to explain what happened, rather than being some 17-year-old girl who couldn\u2019t say anything. So people don\u2019t want to step up and be seen as the bad guy in public. But I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m really speaking out of my ass because I haven\u2019t been in those situations for a while. But we\u2019ll see.\n\nIf you\u2019re intimate with my music, you\u2019re intimate with me and I\u2019m intimate with you. I feel like you\u2019re my friend.\n\nWere there moments in your career when you felt like you were without a voice?\n\nI felt like I couldn\u2019t speak out until I did that [VMAs] speech. And then I felt like, Now I got that out of my system, and I\u2019m able to speak out. But it\u2019s very difficult when you\u2019re young and looking for approval, and you want to be understood, and you\u2019re in a vulnerable position and you want to be pleasing to people who are helping you. Everybody\u2019s got really strong opinions around you, from the makeup artists to the producers, everybody\u2019s been in the business for so much longer than you, and they can drown your opinion out and you don\u2019t even know what you think anymore because you haven\u2019t had time to figure it out. You didn\u2019t have time to figure out, what would I want to wear? Because they already laid it out for you. And you don\u2019t want to be ungrateful, because they\u2019re giving you your life, right? It\u2019s gotta be tough for really young people.\n\nNPR recently called you the \u201cgodmother of 2019\u201d \u2014\n\nWhat?!\n\nMeaning you\u2019ve influenced Billie Eilish, Lana Del Rey, Maggie Rogers, etc. Do you think that\u2019s a fair assessment? Do you listen to any of them?\n\nI don\u2019t really follow, uh, I don\u2019t. I feel bad. But I don\u2019t.\n\nYou got really candid with TMZ last year when they caught you at the airport. They asked you if you felt that the abuse of power by men and sexually predatory behavior toward young women was just as prevalent in the music industry as it is in Hollywood. You replied: \u201cFuck yes. Are you fucking kidding me? Yeah.\u201d Is there any particular thing or person you were referring to?\n\nI have a million stories I could tell. But I can\u2019t tell them. Legally, I cannot. I\u2019d be putting myself in danger if I told some of them. I think when I\u2019m older I\u2019ll write a book. And then I can say whatever I want to say. [Laughs.] I\u2019ll write my story.\n\nText from Apple a few days later:\n\nSo I was thinking about three things I call bullshit on (music business, Trump, Variety\u2019s Twitter \u201cglitch\u201d). It\u2019s all about money. That\u2019s why each one of those things gets to me. It\u2019s selling lies, for personal gain. BUT \u2014 more importantly, I forgot to tell you my J.Lo story from like 1996 or \u201897! I was in NY at a pre-Grammy party (because I used to go to shit like that). And my sister Maude was with me, but she was on the other side of this big room filled with little tables and mingling celebrities and executives\u2026 So J.Lo\u2019s album hadn\u2019t come out yet,and nobody had started talking about her ass yet \u2014 and I swear I saw her (J.Lo), and ran to get my sister JUST to show her how beautiful that ass was \u2014 and the moment I pointed her out to my sister, J.Lo turned to speak to someone and her butt was just above table-level, and her butt knocked over someone\u2019s glass of champagne and she didn\u2019t even notice. It was glorious.\n\nHave you met her since?\n\nNo! And one of the few movie premieres I\u2019ve been to was Out of Sight, but I didn\u2019t meet her there either. (I used to love how she says in that movie, \u201cYou wanted to tussle. We tussled.\u201d) And I was at the Oscars when she wore the Google-image-inspiring dress. [Editor\u2019s Note: Lopez wore the dress at the 2000 Grammys.] Didn\u2019t meet her then \u2026 We\u2019ve been in the same room a few times I guess, but never met.\n\nWell, she\u2019s been saying complimentary things about you and your music on the Hustlers press tour.\n\nShe HAS?! I\u2019m still getting over watching Lorene Scafaria say my name and seeing J.Lo nod, like she knows who I am \u2014 that\u2019s just strange!\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "description": "These days, the \u201cCriminal\u201d singer Fiona Apple spends most of her time at home, working on a new album.
