But we\u2019d like to see if we can do something. And if we can, that would be great. And if we can\u2019t, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on Monday about whether Mr Bolton thought Mr Trump\u2019s efforts to befriend and charm Mr Kim would work, Mr Bolton demurred.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on that,\u201d he said. \u201cNice try.\u201d\n\nBut he made clear he disagreed with Mr Trump\u2019s position that the United States was in \u201cno rush\u201d for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cTime works against those who oppose nuclear proliferation,\u201d Mr Bolton said. \u201cA relaxed attitude to time is a benefit to the likes of North Korea and Iran.\u201d\n\nThe differences between Mr Trump and Mr Bolton on North Korea were hardly a secret during his time at the National Security Council.\n\nDuring a four-day state visit to Japan in May, Mr Trump contradicted Mr Bolton and Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, who both called North Korea\u2019s short-range ballistic missile tests a violation of UN Security Council resolutions.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,\u201d Mr Trump wrote on Twitter, noting he trusted Mr Kim to \u201ckeep his promise to me\u201d.\n\nMr Trump has also cited Mr Bolton\u2019s comments from the year before about using a \u201cLibyan model\u201d for disarmament in North Korea as among the reasons he was dismissed.\n\nHis reference to Muammar Gaddafi\u200b\u2019s agreement to swap his nascent nuclear programme for economic integration with the West angered the North Koreans who saw it as an example of why no one should trust US efforts to disarm another nation since Gaddafi was eventually killed.\n\nMr Bolton\u2019s comments raised questions about what other splits with Mr Trump he may reveal. His remarks, however, were limited to North Korea.\n\n\u201cI was struck by how consistent his views were with what they have historically been,\u201d said Mr Cha, who moderated a question-and-answer session with Mr Bolton on Monday.\n\nWhile Mr Bolton declined to comment directly on his time in the administration, Mr Cha said \u201cthe fact that he spent all that time working on this issue, and was there in Hanoi, and he comes out and his views are still very sceptical, it speaks for itself\u201d.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "In his first public comments since leaving the White House, John Bolton, the former US national security adviser, delivered a stark warning about Donald Trump\u2019s approach to North Korea, undercutting the president\u2019s insistence that its leader, Kim Jong-un, wanted to make a denuclearisat", "authors": ["Annie Karni"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/01/12/John-Bolton.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
