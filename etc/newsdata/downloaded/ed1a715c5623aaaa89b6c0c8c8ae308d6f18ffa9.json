His mandate was to combat anti-American messaging. But it proved to be a case study in why government doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cI found government too big, too slow, too bureaucratic. It constantly gets in its own way,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe dream of an outsider coming in to reform government is just that \u2014 a dream.\u201d\n\nWhen Stengel took his job, the big challenge was countering extremist messaging from what became the Islamic State. It\u2019s a painful story. The State Department had a unit called the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, which had been established by Secretary Hillary Clinton in 2011. \u201cFrom the moment of its birth, CSCC was a problem child,\u201d Stengel writes, underfunded, misunderstood and mistrusted by the bureaucracy.\n\nWhile the Islamic State rampaged online, CSCC deliberated. Tasks that should have taken weeks instead took months. Other agencies undermined anything that threatened their turf. During one long meeting, a lieutenant general whispered to Stengel: \u201cI know how to defeat ISIS. . . . Get them involved in the interagency process.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["David Ignatius", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Why-America-Is-Losing-The-Information-War-To-Russia"], "top_image": ""}
