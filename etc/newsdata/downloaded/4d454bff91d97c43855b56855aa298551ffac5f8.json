John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, asserted that this counters claims of a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d\n\nDIPLOMAT BILL TAYLOR TESTIFIES TRUMP USED UKRAINE AID, WH MEETING AS LEVERAGE FOR PROBES\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, this was about quid pro quo and whether or not the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld and on that most important issue. Neither this witness or any other witness has provided any evidence that there was a quid pro quo, or any evidence that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld on July 25,\u201d Ratcliffe said on \u201cThe Story\u201d Tuesday night, claiming that absent testimony speaking to that point, \u201ca quid pro quo is legally impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo.\u201d \u2014 Rep. John Ratcliffe\n\nHe was referring to the now-famous phone call on July 25 between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump pressed for investigations into 2016 election interference and Biden family dealings in the country, specifically Hunter Biden's role on the board of natural gas firm Burisma Holdings.\n\nA source familiar with the testimony confirmed to Fox News that during questioning on Capitol Hill Tuesday, Taylor said the Ukrainians did not know at the time of the call about the hold on U.S. military aid.\n\n\u201cThe mainstream media reporting that he provided evidence of a quid pro quo involving military aid is false \u2014 I questioned him directly on that,\u201d Ratcliffe said Tuesday. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what he said \u2026 but I can tell you what he didn\u2019t say \u2014 neither he nor any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cYou can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo.\u201d\n\nThe president echoed Ratcliffe\u2019s comments on Twitter early Wednesday, quoting from his appearance on Fox News.\n\n\"Where is the whistleblower? The Do Nothing Dems case is DEAD!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nHowever, Taylor did testify that he was told U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland informed top Ukrainian aide Andriy Yermak weeks later that \u201csecurity assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation.\u201d\n\nTaylor testified that he learned of the Sondland-Yermak conversation during a phone call with National Security Council aide Tim Morrison.\n\n\u201cI was alarmed by what Mr. Morrison told me about the Sondland-Yermak conversation,\u201d Taylor testified. \u201cThis was the first time I had heard that the security assistance not just the White House meeting \u2014 was conditioned on the investigations.\u201d\n\nSo according to Taylor's testimony, the Ukraine government eventually was informed of the apparent reason for the aid delay.\n\nThat same day, Taylor said, he sent Sondland a text message asking if security assistance and a White House meeting \"are conditioned on investigations,\" prompting Sondland to request Taylor call him.\n\n\"During that phone call, Ambassador Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President Zelenskyy to state publicly that Ukrain will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election,\" Taylor testified.\n\n\u201cBy mid-July it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelensky wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections,\u201d Taylor testified.\n\nThroughout this, Trump still insisted he was not seeking a \"quid pro quo.\"\n\nTaylor's testimony, though, has fueled Democratic criticism amid the impeachment inquiry launched in the House last month over revelations concerning Trump's phone call with Zelensky.\n\nTrump took heat for pressuring the Ukrainian president to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine \u2014 concerning Hunter\u2019s role on the board of Burisma Holdings, and Joe Biden's bid to pressure the former Ukrainian president to fire a top prosecutor who was investigating the firm. A whistleblower who first aired the allegations claimed Trump was improperly soliciting foreign aid to investigate a political opponent to ultimately influence the 2020 election.\n\nAt the heart of the debate today is whether U.S. military aid was directly tied to these requests.\n\nThe president\u2019s request came after millions in U.S. aid to Ukraine had been frozen. But the White House and the president\u2019s allies have denied a quid pro quo \u2013 though acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney recently seemed to say otherwise, before walking it back \u2013 and the Bidens have maintained that they did \u201cnothing wrong.\u201d\n\nDemocrats called Taylor's testimony the most damaging yet.\n\n\"The testimony is very disturbing,\" said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., used the same word. Asked why, he said, \"Because it's becoming more distinct.\"\n\nBut top Republicans cited Ratcliffe\u2019s questioning as a big moment in the hearing that undermined Taylor's argument.\n\n\u201cIn 90 seconds, we had John Ratcliffe destroy Taylor\u2019s whole argument,\u201d House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday in an interview Tuesday on \"The Ingraham Angle.\"\n\nREPUBLICAN LAWMAKER 'DESTROYED' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY WITNESS ARGUMENT: MCCARTHY\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, D-Calif., echoed the sentiment.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, in two minutes, John Ratcliffe destroyed this witness,\u201d Nunes said on \u201cHannity.\u201d \u201cThere is no quid pro quo.\u201d\n\nAnd Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said reports of Taylor\u2019s testimony had been \u201claughably overblown and don\u2019t tell the full story.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill no evidence of quid pro quo. Much of the statement and hearsay allegations didn\u2019t hold up against any real scrutiny. The FULL transcript should be released immediately,\u201d Meadows tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, Taylor described the existence of an \"irregular\" communications channel with Ukraine led by Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani, and a \"weird combination of encouraging, confusing, and ultimately alarming circumstances\" once he arrived in Kiev. The statement confirmed previous reporting of Taylor's remarks by Fox News.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re, Chad Pergram, Mike Emanuel, Alex Pappas, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump and allies in Congress pushed back against damaging revelations from diplomat Bill Taylor\u2019s Tuesday testimony\u00a0saying the witness also acknowledged under questioning that Ukraine was initially in the dark on the aid holdup.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Rep.
