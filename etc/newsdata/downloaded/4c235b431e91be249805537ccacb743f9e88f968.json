One of the men later died.\n\n\n\nThe officers, who were arrested on Friday, appeared in the Randburg Magistrate's Court on Monday. Their case was postponed to October 30.\n\nAccording to Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) acting spokesperson Sontaga Seisa, the four constables allegedly continuously punched and kicked the two arrested males until the 39-year-old detainee dropped down whilst handcuffed.\n\n\"The fact that the deceased dropped down and started bleeding did not deter the constables from assaulting and kicking him further. After the assaults, the suspects left the two men in the holding cell. The surviving assault victim tried to alert the police as he noticed that the deceased was breathing abnormal, but they ignored the report.\n\n\"Later on, the police removed the surviving assault victim from the holding cell and took him to Randburg police station for detention. Later that night, the deceased\u2019s relative visited the Honeydew police station and insisted to see his brother. It was there that it was discovered that he was no more,\" said Seisa.\n\nIPID was informed about the incident and responded by conducting a quality investigation which led to the arrest of the four constables.\n\nSeisa said they were intending to oppose bail.", "description": "The case against four police officers accused of assaulting and killing a detainee has been postponed to later this week for a formal bail application.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9419/28027d1aa27543918f9d78be5c985a8c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
