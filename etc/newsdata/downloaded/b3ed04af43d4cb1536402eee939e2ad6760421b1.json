(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nMaryland\u2019s football team opened the Michael Locksley era with ease, dominating its season debut to the extent that four quarterbacks had the chance to lead drives and the first-team players essentially closed up shop at halftime. But the reality of Saturday\u2019s 79-0 victory, which featured 11 Terrapins touchdowns and a lockdown defense, was that the opponent was, well, Howard. The Football Championship Subdivision foe bears little resemblance to what the Terrapins will face when No. 21 Syracuse marches into College Park this weekend.\n\nSo how much does that Howard win really mean? Do season-opening blowouts provide any insight into how a team\u2019s season will unfold? Maryland players say they won\u2019t dwell on the result, and Locksley made note of the team\u2019s correctable mistakes the moment he stepped to the lectern to speak with reporters after the game. But recent history says teams that win openers by 50 points or more typically finish with more victories based on overall win totals in the top-tier Football Bowl Subdivision.\n\n[John Feinstein: Michigan vs. Army is a guarantee game \u2014 it guarantees worry for both coaches]\n\nSince 2000, the year Sports Reference\u2019s single-game database begins, the average season win total for an FBS team is 6.5. In that same period of time and not counting this season, 101 FBS teams have won their season openers by at least 50 points; the average win total for those teams jumps to 8.3.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that a season-opening blowout causes a team to win more games in a season. It simply means these programs are more likely to be the same ones that go on to finish the year well.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely a confidence-booster,\u201d linebacker Shaq Smith said of the win against Howard, \u201cbut in the same breath, we have a 24-hour rule, where we celebrate that game on Saturday but Sunday we flip the page and we\u2019re getting ready for our next game.\u201d\n\nThere are still a handful of cautionary examples, which can remind fans that a strong debut might not indicate promise. Tulsa defeated Indiana State, 51-0, to begin the 2001 season and then went winless the rest of the season. Four times since 2000, teams have won their openers by at least 50 only to finish the year with a 3-9 record (Louisiana Tech in 2000, Eastern Michigan in 2008, Georgia Tech in 2015 and Marshall in 2016).\n\nBut about 85 percent of the time, these teams finish the year bowl eligible. Maryland falling short of a bowl game, which is the outcome projected by some advanced analytics, would be atypical.\n\nAgainst Howard, Maryland jumped to a 28-0 lead by the end of the first quarter and a 56-0 advantage by halftime. Locksley removed his starters, giving the reserves valuable game experience, but the Terps continued to drive down the field without issues, leading to the massive margin of victory. The 79-point win stands as the second-largest margin of victory for an FBS team in its season opener since 2000, behind only Oklahoma State\u2019s 84-point win over Savannah State in 2012.\n\nMaybe this provides optimism, something to hold on to even though Saturday\u2019s FCS opponent offered little opportunity to glimpse how this team will operate under Locksley. Maybe the lopsided result means the Terps are more likely to outperform expectations this season.\n\nBut inside the program, \u201cwe\u2019re more about the process of how we practice, how we prepare, how we execute each and every play,\u201d Locksley said in a response that would make Nick Saban, his former boss at Alabama and champion of the Process, proud. \u201cAnd the scoreboard to us, we try not to let that even come into play when we game plan. \u2026 The key is to go in and get the corrections made for the fundamental mistakes or the mental errors that took place.\u201d\n\nSo about those improvements. The 79-0 result screams there were few mistakes, at least not glaring ones, but the players have pinpointed the areas that need work. It would be unnatural for them not to.\n\nIn his Maryland debut that ended at halftime, quarterback Josh Jackson threw for 245 yards and four touchdowns with no interceptions. But on Tuesday, he rattled off some of his less-than-perfect moments \u2014 when he targeted and missed DJ Turner downfield on third and five rather than working through his progressions and some pre-snap penalties. (Maryland still finished the game with only 45 yards in penalties, a problem area last season.) And the defense, which didn\u2019t allow any points and held Howard to just one first down in the first half, could have communicated better, Locksley said.\n\n\u201cPre-snap, post-snap, even during the play, when we get back on the sideline, communicating what we\u2019re seeing and the adjustments that we have to make,\u201d said Smith, a graduate transfer from Clemson, the top-tier program that lost to Syracuse in 2017 and nearly lost again in 2018. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest thing that we took from that first game that we\u2019ve been harping on thus far that\u2019s going to help us this week.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where these players will direct their focus, not leaning on the opener that came as a welcomed start. Four other programs around the country \u2014 LSU, Penn State, Washington State and Central Florida \u2014 also had wins of at least 50 points to begin their season. History proves most teams that fall into this category will go on to have successful seasons, so now Maryland will hope it doesn\u2019t become an outlier.\n\nRead more:\n\nTerps blow out Howard, 79-0, to open Michael Locksley era\n\nJerry Brewer: The SEC had an embarrassing Week 1.
