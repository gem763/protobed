At another point this week, Trump declared, \u201cThere has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have.\u201d\n\nSome amateur history buffs, including my colleague Peter Nicholas, chose to quibble with the accuracy of this claim, noting that perhaps the four U.S. presidents who have been assassinated in office might beg to differ. But the sentiment Trump was expressing runs to the core of his identity\u2014and it\u2019s likely to shape his approach to the coming impeachment battle.\n\nIn the story Trump tells himself, he is a man continually besieged by a cabal of jealous insiders determined to destroy him. This conspiracy of saboteurs has taken different forms over the course of his career. When he was an outer-borough real-estate scion trying to make it in Manhattan, the bad guys were the city\u2019s sneering blue bloods, who didn\u2019t invite him to their parties and rolled their eyes at his theatrics. Then it was the bankers who refused to lend him money, and the media snobs who made fun of his short fingers, and the party hacks who refused to support his presidential-primary bid, and the \u201cdeep-state\u201d bureaucrats who tried to subvert his administration.", "description": "Victimhood is at the core of the president\u2019s identity\u2014and it\u2019s likely to shape his approach to the coming impeachment battle.", "authors": ["Mckay Coppins"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_1170743352/facebook.jpg?1569593477", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
