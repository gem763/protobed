Trees and the grass are dying and fish and some animals because it is rainy here, the water washes the oil into water sources where there are fish and animals.\u201d\n\nSouth Sudan has been wracked by conflict since 2013 due to political rivalry among the ruling elite, and fighting devastated the oil sector \u2014 its main earner.\n\nConcerns have mounted over the health impact of the oil fields to surrounding communities, after decades of companies flouting environmental regulations in the war-torn nation.\n\nA 2014 study by Cordaid reported that: \u201cOil production pollutants are suspected by communities to have caused many new health problems, such as increased infertility in women, a higher number of miscarriages, and eye and skin problems.\u201d\n\nGerman NGO Sign of Hope, which has investigated the impact of oil pollution in the country, estimates as many as 600,000 people may be affected.\n\nChuang said government was busy investigating the effects of oil pollution in the area.\n\nAt its peak, oil production in South Sudan was at 350,000 barrels a day. Since the signing of the peace deal production has gone from 135,000 to 178,000 barrels a day.", "description": "Juba (AFP) \u2013 South Sudan\u2019s petroleum ministry warned Monday of more oil spills from poorly maintained facilities, after a pipeline leaked", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/a53d48_south-sudan-petroleum-ministry-000-barrel-leak-had-contained-local-officials-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
