Bolton says he resigned. Either way, their conflict was deep \u2014 and irreconcilable.\n\nFor months, the Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson had been lobbying President Donald Trump to fire John Bolton, telling him it was foolish to keep on his team a top adviser who did not share his views on pressing national security issues.\n\nCarlson and a host of others, including several senior administration officials, frequently told Trump that Bolton, a career hawk with a reputation as a vicious bureaucratic infighter, not only wasn\u2019t on his team but was using the news media against him.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump, who became a fan of his future national security adviser while watching his frequent television appearances on Fox, told these people that he enjoyed Bolton\u2019s presence in negotiations because he believed he spooked U.S. adversaries like Iran. But he chafed at reading about and watching news reports of Bolton\u2019s disagreements with administration policy on everything from talks with North Korea to pulling troops out of Syria to angling for a sitdown with Iranian leaders.\n\n\u201cWhere there is public disagreement like that and it keeps going on from one issue to another, I do think there is a cumulative effect on the human psyche and it probably leads to less communication,\u201d said Gen. Jack Keane, the former Army vice chief of staff who talks frequently with the president and other senior administration officials.\n\nUltimately, it was hearing media accounts about how Bolton had advised the president to scuttle a meeting with Taliban leaders at Camp David that proved a breaking point for Trump, according to sources in and out of the administration. In the president\u2019s telling, he had taken his own counsel in arriving at the decision to call off the meeting and end the negotiations, and he was infuriated to hear Bolton credited with influencing his decision.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3857/1155968404_6085050604001_6085042811001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nBolton\u2019s exit is a stark illustration of how Trump grown increasingly confident in his own judgment on national security \u2014 and how he\u2019s developed a greater sense of urgency to follow through on his campaign promise to reduce U.S. entanglements abroad. Bolton saw things differently and made little secret of it. Both men were equally firm in their convictions, and the conflict proved irreconcilable.\n\nA Bolton spokesman did not reply to a request for comment, but this account is based on conversations with nearly a dozen administration officials and people close to the president.\n\nBolton\u2019s critics, including Carlson, also used the incident to urge the president to act. He was a leaker, they told him. Others in the administration feared the same, at times excluding Bolton and his allies from sensitive meetings for fear they would weaponize the information exchanged to their advantage.\n\nWhile Bolton\u2019s predecessor, H.R. McMaster, had worked to adhere to a traditional process where the president is presented a range of options on key issues, along with a list of risks associated with each option, Bolton operated differently, preferring instead to give the president his own guidance in private. While many had griped that McMaster held too many meetings, under the Bolton regime, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at one point joked with colleagues about jump-starting his own National Security Council process to fill the Bolton void.\n\nBolton, the president\u2019s third national security adviser, was never a natural fit in the Trump White House. Serious and cerebral, the 70-year-old Yale-trained lawyer immediately went about assembling a team of like-minded loyalists immensely capable of pushing his policy priorities -- which were sometimes, but not always, those of his boss.\n\nWhile Bolton has served effectively in the senior ranks of previous administrations, after Trump passed him over to be secretary of state during the transition in 2016, Bolton widely acknowledged that this was likely to be his last -- and most senior -- government post. That meant that unlike some of his colleagues, most notably Pompeo, who is 55, he had little to lose by aggressively pursuing some of his own policy priorities, be it sticking it to Iran or dismantling the International Criminal Court, even if the president didn\u2019t share them.\n\nAs with previous top foreign-policy aides including McMaster and Rex Tillerson -- and even James Mattis, who resigned of his own volition -- substantive disagreements and stylistic differences simply led the president to seek Bolton\u2019s advice less frequently.\n\n\u201cThe handwriting\u2019s been on the wall for a long time. You can think back to John Bolton literally being sent to Mongolia at the time that Trump was having his last meeting with Kim Jong Un, which is, you know, being sent to Mongolia is kind of a joke, right?\u201d said David Rothkopf, who has written extensively about the NSC. (Trump brought Carlson, the Fox News host, along with him instead.)\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/2439/1155968404_6085050598001_6085050972001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nEven Bolton\u2019s dismissal instantly became a matter of dispute between the two men \u2014 going public just moments after the president announced his departure. Bolton was left to fume privately to allies that Trump had mischaracterized the events that led to his exit, and publicly to reporters seeking to illuminate the nature of their dispute.\n\nWhile the president said in a tweet that he had asked for Bolton\u2019s resignation on Monday evening, Bolton told ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl that Trump was \u201cflatly wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe never asked me to resign directly or indirectly,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cI slept on it and resigned this morning.\u201d\n\nWhile Bolton\u2019s deputy, Charles Kupperman, was on Tuesday named acting national security adviser, few in the White House believed the longtime Bolton acolyte would remain in that position for the long term, and the president said he would name a permanent replacement next week.\n\nAmong the names being floated for the position are Stephen Biegun, currently the U.S. special representative for North Korea, who was previously considered for the position, and the retired Army Col. Douglas MacGregor, a frequent guest on Carlson\u2019s program.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told the Fox News Channel\u2019s Bret Baier on Tuesday evening that the president had also said he was considering the vice president\u2019s national security adviser, Keith Kellogg; Brian Hook, currently the special envoy for Iran; and Ricky Waddell, an assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and an NSC veteran.\n\nBut critics cautioned that the president\u2019s fourth national security adviser is likely to have little sway with the president.\n\n\u201cThe next national security adviser of the United States is going to be Donald Trump, just like the current national security adviser of the United States is in fact Donald Trump,\u201d Rothkopf said. \u201cThe next national security adviser is going to have [the job] in name only.\u201d", "description": "The president says he fired his national security adviser.
