There is no questioning that.\n\nKris Bryant and Willson Contreras enjoyed resurgent campaigns; Javier Baez was one of the NL's best hitters before suffering a thumb injury; Jason Heyward had his best offensive season on the North Side, while Anthony Rizzo and Kyle Schwarber, arguably, had career years at the plate.\n\nAnd yet, among those performances were two constants: the suboptimal production from Cubs center fielders and second basemen.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Cubs used five different center fielders in 2019, with Albert Almora Jr. (80) and Jason Heyward (74) receiving the bulk of the starts. This pales in comparison to the team's second base rotation, however, where six players started at least 10 games.\n\n\"Center field and second base were the two positions where we had the least production this year, we had the most trouble finding consistent performance,\" Cubs president Theo Epstein said at Monday's end-of-season press conference.\n\nCubs second basemen posted a combined .220/.301/.383 (.684 OPS) slash line, all team lows (sans pitchers and designated hitters). League-wide, they ranked 28th in average and 21st in OPS, though Ben Zobrist's four-month leave of absence certainly played a role here.\n\nCubs center fielders weren't much better, ranking second-worst among the team's positional groups with a .232/.305/.388 (.693 OPS) slash line. League-wide, they checked in at 20th in both average and OPS.\n\nAlmora finished the season with career lows in average and on-base percentage. This led the Cubs to: a) play Heyward in center field more, b) acquire Nick Castellanos and c) make Almora a defensive replacement.\n\nStory continues\n\nHeyward's final numbers were negatively affected by his August stint leading off - where he is less comfortable hitting than other spots. But with no better options, he essentially took one for the team, though former manager Joe Maddon probably could've pulled the plug on the experiment sooner.\n\nCoincidentally, Heyward moved to the leadoff spot around the same time he became the Cubs' full-time center fielder. So, while he had a solid season overall, his toughest stretch came as a center fielder, which \"helped\" drag down the team's overall numbers for the position.\n\nSome form of change is coming to the Cubs roster this offseason. And while Epstein admitted center field/leadoff is a position they'd look to upgrade, it's not like it'll be an easy task.\n\n\"We do have in-house options, but being transparent, of course it's an area where you look to upgrade and see if you can get the total package, with the prototypical center fielder who can also leadoff,\" Epstein said. \"If you look at the landscape of center fielders in the game, it's not exactly a position with great surplus or an overabundance of options out there.\"\n\nSo, what do the Cubs do if there's no clear option for them to acquire?\n\n\"You just have to be realistic,\" Epstein said. \"If you spend all your time waiting for that next guy who solves all your problems to be there, you might pass on some good options, where you can put things together with a platoon or use a player that you currently have and compliment him with a more attainable player from outside the organization.\"\n\nThe Cubs have an intriguing second base option in Nico Hoerner, who can also play center field, if needed. The 22-year-old joined the Cubs in September, filling in at shortstop for the injured Baez and Addison Russell. Barring a trade, Baez will be the Cubs starting shortstop next season, but Hoerner's contact-oriented approach makes him a good fit for the Cubs lineup, possibly as a leadoff hitter.\n\nEpstein was complimentary of how Hoerner responded to his September promotion, though he added that the Cubs haven't determined where the 22-year-old will start the 2020 season.\n\n\"We don't ever draw it up that a player's gonna skip Triple-A,\" he said. \"It's not determined yet where Nico's gonna start next season, but given his mental makeup, given his skillset, who he is as a person, we felt that was something, under the extraordinary circumstances, that he could handle.\"\n\nIf Hoerner starts the 2020 season in the minor leagues, other Cubs second basemen under contract include Russell, Daniel Descalso, Tony Kemp, Robel Garcia, David Bote and Ian Happ.\n\nThe Cubs demoted Russell to Triple-A twice this season, though he hit just .237/.308/.391 in 82 big-league games. He also missed the first month of the season while serving a domestic violence suspension.\n\nDescalso was hampered by an ankle injury for much of the season, which affected his performance at the plate. Kemp brought the Cubs a contact-oriented approach, but he hit just .183 after they acquired him at the trade deadline.\n\nGarcia showed promise, though he struggled to hit breaking pitches. Bote and Happ did contribute on consistent basis offensively, but they saw more time at third base and in the outfield, respectively.\n\nPoint being, there's no option that jumps off the page right now. Whether it's center field, second base or elsewhere, Epstein and Co. won't hesitate to make an upgrade, should they see fit.\n\n\"We struggled as an organization this year to make sure that with the major league team, the whole was as good or better than the sum of the parts,\" he said. \"I think we had a lot of good individual performances, we had a lot of talent and ability.\n\n\"I think if we do our job the right way, we're going to have a lot of talent next year. We're going to score a lot of runs, we're going to prevent a lot of runs.\"\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
