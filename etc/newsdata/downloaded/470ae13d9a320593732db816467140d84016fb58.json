My 12-year-old daughter thrust a crumpled order form at me and I smoothed it on my knee to look over. It looked standard, with various packs and add-ons to choose from, all costing a fortune.\n\nThen, I saw some options I hadn\u2019t seen before, next to the keyrings and USB sticks. Not one, but two different \u201cretouching\u201d packages, promising to \u201cremove blemishes\u201d and in the more expensive option to also \u201cwhiten teeth, remove scars and even out skin tone\u201d.\n\nFor $12 you could choose to airbrush your primary school child.\n\nSam Walker (@WalkerSam) The girls have their school photo today and there is the option to AIRBRUSH the picture! There are two levels offered!! What the....?! Have complained! What 8 yr old needs to be paranoid about an \u201cuneven skin tone\u201d pic.twitter.com/6BGCx3FRZ9\n\nMy husband asked school staff why they were offering this when he dropped the girls off, and they shrugged and said it was common practice. He then bumped into the photographer himself and asked the same. \u201cKids get zits, you don\u2019t want to be reminded of that.\u201d And the teeth and skin tone? \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to look their best?\u201d\n\nWhen did \u201clooking your best\u201d become not looking like you do in real life? When did we start to tell kids altered versions of themselves are more attractive, better than the real version?\n\nMy youngest daughter has mastocytosis, an autoimmune condition that presents itself as skin lesions. She has them all over her body and face. She has always had them and although they have faded a lot, she will always have them.\n\nSince she could understand what the lesions are, we\u2019ve talked about the fact that they are as much a part of her as anything else. \u201cMy spots are part of the family,\u201d she always says. Any \u201cevening out\u201d of her skin tone would be airbrushing away the person she is. As part of the same condition, she also has an issue with the enamel on her teeth. They\u2019re a pretty shade of yellow. They are also what makes her her.\n\nWhen you order pictures, you get the class group photo thrown in. It\u2019s not clear if you click \u201cenhance\u201d whether they pick your child out of the crowd to clean them up, or do a job lot. Will my girls be the only two without DayGlo smiles and perfectly contoured skin?\n\nSurely the joy of the school photograph is in the revisiting decades later. The dodgy haircut, the chipped tooth and wonky tie are part of the memory. Where\u2019s the joy in homogeny?", "description": "What message do we send our kids when schools offer retouching to \u2018remove blemishes\u2019 and \u2018even skin tone\u2019?", "authors": ["Sam Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ccd95ad5c8d1a6fa57a5f24a0cbf474abc6cb10/202_0_2796_1678/master/2796.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c41e5db863ea68e852da99e973c7d84d", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
