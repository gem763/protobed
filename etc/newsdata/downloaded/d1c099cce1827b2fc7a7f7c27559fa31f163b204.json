Look on the ASA.\u201d\n\n\"My gosh! They're all going against the wind. The wind\u2019s 120 knots out of the west.\u201d\n\n\"Look at that thing, dude!\"\n\nYou can watch the footage below:\n\nThe publisher of the website where the Navy spokesperson\u2019s comments were published said he was taken aback by the admittance.\n\n\u201cI very much expected that when the US military addressed the videos, they would coincide with language we see on official documents that have now been released, and they would label them as \u2018drones\u2019 or \u2018balloons\u2019,\u201d John Greenwald told Motherboard.\n\n\u201cHowever, they did not. They went on the record stating the \u2018phenomena\u2019 depicted in those videos, is \u2018unidentified\u2019. That really made me surprised, intrigued, excited and motivated to push harder for the truth.\u201d\n\nThe Navy\u2019s acknowledgement comes after it officially changed its policy to make it easier for personnel to report strange sightings in the airspace.\n\n\u201cThe Navy and USAF [United States Air Force] take these reports very seriously and investigate each and every report,\u201d Mr Gradisher told Motherboard earlier this year.\n\n---Watch the latest videos from Yahoo UK---", "description": "The US Navy made the startling admittance over videos released by a rock singer.", "authors": ["Yahoo Uk Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rnkWS.AV9TgfoZcT9tY3Gg--~B/aD0zNzk1O3c9Njc0NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/f6ba0ee0-d9fe-11e9-b59f-2437967fb5e5", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
