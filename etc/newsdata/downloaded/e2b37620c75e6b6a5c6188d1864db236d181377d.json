REUTERS/Andreas Gebert\n\nAMS, best known for supplying Apple (AAPL.O) with sensors for its latest iPhones, this month offered 38.50 euros per share for the leader in automotive lighting, outbidding private equity investors Bain Capital and Carlyle Group (CG.O) by 10%.\n\nTo reduce dependence on smartphone producers, AMS wants to combine its business with Osram\u2019s to expand in the auto industry and supply manufacturers with sensors and lighting solutions for self-driving cars. It has said it would cut Osram jobs outside Germany, sell its digital business and phase-out its consumer general lighting LED business.\n\nOsram, hit by profit warnings and a weak car market, had initially backed the offer from Bain and Carlyle, which had agreed to maintain it as an independent company with its existing management and to support its strategic direction.\n\nBut the Munich-based company said in a statement recommending the offer that \u201cthe financial attractiveness of the (AMS) offer was to be weighted higher than points of criticism\u201d.\n\nDespite the recommendation there are still reservations at Osram\u2019s headquarters, dominated by doubts about the long-term business prospects and Osram Chief Executive Olaf Berlien expressed his by saying he would not sell his shares to AMS.\n\nOsram\u2019s biggest shareholder Allianz Global Investors (ALVG.DE), which holds a 9.4% stake, is prepared to follow the advice, a financial industry source told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIf there aren\u2019t any better options, Allianz Global Investors will tender its shares to AMS,\u201d the source added.\n\nAGI had rejected the bid of 35 euros per share from Bain & Carlyle as too low before AMS\u2019s counterbid. The duo, who have the option to raise their offer, declined to comment on Monday.\n\nThe next largest Osram shareholder is Swiss bank UBS (UBSG.S) with a 6.2% stake. Together with HSBC (HSBA.L) UBS is providing AMS\u2019s 4.2 billion euro bridge financing for the deal.\n\nSTRONG SUPPORT\n\n\u201cWe have received the very clear feedback that our investor base as well as new investors are looking towards this transaction with a very positive attitude,\u201d Chief Executive Alexander Everke told journalists in Munich.\n\nTo capitalise on the momentum, AMS lowered the acceptance threshold of its offer to 62.5% from the previous 70%.\n\nEverke also tried to allay German trade union concerns regarding far-reaching job cuts, saying that many of the existing jobs were complementary. However, he did not exclude redundancies for operational reasons in Germany.\n\nThe logo of German lighting manufacturer Osram is illuminated at the company's headquarters in Munich, Germany, September 16, 2019.
