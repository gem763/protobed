And it\u2019s why he has launched a new company called Path, which pitches access to specialized substance addiction treatment professionals as an employee health benefit, to do something about it.\n\n\u201cI have unfortunately lost five friends now to alcohol and opioid overdoses. I went to five funerals in three years,\u201d says Bruno. \u201cEvery time I would end up talking to friends and family afterwards\u2026 and everyone would ask, \u2018What could we have done?\u2019 \u201c\n\nNow Bruno is doing something.\n\nWhile Alcoholics Anonymous and rehabilitation facilities provide one solution, Bruno says that neither one has the scope to address the enormity of the problem.\n\nBruno thinks Path may be the avenue to best address the issue. The idea is to provide near-instant access to specialized providers of substance abuse treatment as a benefit that employers can offer to their staff.\n\nAs the founder of HomeTeam, which provided in-home senior care and a software toolkit to manage that care, Bruno already has an understanding of the healthcare marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe plug in to an employer and provide a holistic solution for the employees. We bring a doctor, a therapy and a coach,\u201d says Bruno of the new service he\u2019s launching. \u201cWe\u2019re not a provider ourselves and we bring a network of providers.\u201d\n\nThe business model evolved as Bruno began researching how things are currently done. \u201cI have volunteered at AA and rehab facilities [and] I talked to labor union leaders across the country,\u201d says Bruno. He also reached out to the nation\u2019s 23 largest employers and shadowed treatment specialists to see how substance abuse treatment is currently handled.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I saw is that 10% \u2014 or one in 10 adults across the U.S. \u2014 have a substance abuse disorder,\u201d says Bruno. \u201cThat shocked people because it\u2019s more than diabetes.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, about 33% of mental health issues are actually addiction-related, which can add additional stress on an employers\u2019 healthcare costs.\n\nThe founding team at Path, which includes Bruno and Gabriel Diop, who heads partnerships, and Greg Moore, who leads product development, all think of substance abuse treatment as an access issue. People looking for treatment simply don\u2019t know where to go to get the most effective and affordable help.\n\n\u201cToday the health insurance company would give a list of in-network providers and it\u2019s up to the patient to figure out where to go [and] 50% of time they go out of network,\u201d says Bruno.\n\nWhen Path works with a large employer, a phone call is made directly to the company and that call goes to a clinical social worker, who handles the intake of a prospective patient. The company has deals with addiction doctors in the geographies where it operates and can ensure that an assessment can be done within 48 hours.\n\nAfter the assessment, a treatment plan is drawn up and the company will manage that process for the employer, and the physician as well.\n\nPath is already talking to two Fortune 100 companies about deploying its service. \u201cIt\u2019s a targeted, regional service,\u201d says Bruno. \u201cNot a national service.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles-based company has raised $5.35 million to date in a round of funding led by Upfront Ventures, with participation from Sequoia Benefits, Radian Street Capital and angel investors including Barbara Wachsman, the former head of benefits at Disney; Amy Shannon, the former head of benefits at Chevron; and Howard Cherny, the former head of benefits at Cisco.\n\n\u201cPut simply, Path plans to work with the best addiction treatment providers across the continuum in the U.S., which is exactly what is needed. Finally, a team is focusing on core issues of quality and cost-effective treatment,\u201d said Kelly Clark, a member of the Path Clinical Advisory Board, and the former president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine.\n\nNot only can Path help to roll out access to treatment at scale, but the company can also reduce healthcare costs for companies, according to Bruno.\n\n\u201cIt will lower the expense to the plan,\u201d he says. \u201cApproximately 30% to 50% of employees are going out of network for addiction treatment\u2026 that\u2019s $25,000 to $50,000 per month.\u201d\n\nPath\u2019s costs are substantially lower, and the company is only paid if members use the network, he said.\n\n\u201cEmployers have made a commitment to the health and well-being of their employees. If mental health is a top priority for your organization, you can\u2019t ignore [substance use disorders],\u201d said Wachsman, in a statement.", "description": "America has an addiction problem.
