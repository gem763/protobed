I was thinking the worst. I had all sorts of thoughts going through my head.\"\n\nShe sent a message to her brother back home in the UK, who told her to alert staff to Dave's absence.\n\nWhile Sarah did, her mum and dad went to the TUI shop in Carlisle where the couple had booked the holiday.\n\nWhen staff at the hotel said they didn't know where her partner had gone, Sarah's mind began to race.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nEarlier in the day Dave had had an argument with two British men at the hotel who the couple claim had offered them drugs.\n\n\"I was scared as hell,\" she said.\n\n\"I didn't know if those two blokes were still about. I thought they had done something to him.\n\n\"I just kept thinking the worst. My stomach was churning.\"\n\nAfter hours of fretfully searching the resort, at 4.30am she claims a TUI rep called from the UK explaining that Dave had been found.\n\nHe was locked up on the other side of town, where he says he had spent 17 hours in a cell strewn with human faeces with nothing but the concrete to sleep on.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nWhen a rep at the hotel eventually told Sarah where exactly he was being kept a full five hours later, she jumped in a taxi and headed to the police station.\n\nAfter paying the officers \u00a3250 to let him out, Dave told his girlfriend how the confrontation unfolded.\n\n\"I came down into the lobby and the two of them were there,\" he claims.\n\n\"The bigger one started taking his top off and walked towards me. I tried to walk away but they came after me.\n\n\"I told him (the larger man) to go \"f**k himself and pushed him.\"\n\nDave then fled the scene, hiding in another part of the hotel until members of staff escorted him from the premises.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nOnce he was let out of custody, the couple claim they returned to the hotel to be told that Dave was not allowed back in to collect his possessions.\n\nSarah retrieved his belongings and they set about finding another place to stay, which she says they forked out \u00a31,200 for.\n\nWith hotel staff allegedly refusing to communicate with the couple and no one explaining what he had been charged with, Dave turned to TUI reps back in the UK.\n\nThey explained that because he had been evicted for \"aggressive behaviour\" his \"TUI service and rep service\" was void - despite him not having received any kind of official notice or refund for the termination, the couple claim.\n\nNow Dave and Sarah are hoping that they will both be able to get on the TUI transfer from the hotel to the airport so they can catch their plane home.\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nHaving spent all their money on the two hotels, they have been forced to turn to friends back home to scrape together enough cash to get a taxi if Dave is refused access to the coach.\n\n\"We don't know if we can go home or not,\" Dave said.\n\n\"We're trying to raise enough money to get a taxi to the airport.\n\n\"We came away for a holiday and we weren't expecting this to happen. We can't cancel the other hotel room and they're not responding to our messages.\n\n\"It's disgusting to do this to a British tourist.\"\n\nTUI was contacted for comment.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Sarah Hope and Dave Peden's holiday to the Rui Playacar hotel in Mexico's Playa Del Carmen turned into a nightmare", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20650902.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Dave-Pede.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
