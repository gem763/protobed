It's Now In Good Health & Has A New Name!\n\nBack in June, a picture of a famished polar bear that wandered lost into a northern Russian city, hundreds of kilometers from its Arctic habitat, took the world by storm.\n\nAccording to the Siberian Times, the bear crossed the Taymyr Peninsula to reach the industrial city of Norilsk.\n\nStarving polar bear 'can hardly move', say residents of Norilsk. Emaciated animal walked 1500km south and away from Arctic Ocean, searching for food https://t.co/mD7yTaIusd pic.twitter.com/EjMJjS6Bac \u2014 The Siberian Times (@siberian_times) June 18, 2019\n\nThe two-year-old female polar became ill and almost died after scavenging for food on a rubbish heap in Norilsk and urgently needed treatment.\n\nSiberian Times\n\nAfter observing it for a few days Russian experts concluded that it was too underweight and sick to survive alone in the wild.\n\nDon't Miss 13.8 K SHARES 4.2 K SHARES 4.7 K SHARES 4.2 K SHARES 4.3 K SHARES\n\nThat's when they shifted it to a zoo in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk for treatment.\n\nThe polar bear was caught and sent for rehabilitation to Krasnoyarsk\u2019s Royev Ruchei Zoo. According to Siberian Times, the bear is said to be a female aged between one-and-a-half and two years, and they have named it Marfa.\n\nNew pictures of Marfa now show her looking happier and healthier than ever.\n\nThe Siberian Times quoted a spokesman for Royev Ruchei zoo saying,\"For months zoo vets were quite literally fighting for her life. 'Today she weighs slightly over 150kg (24 stone), she is feeling much, much better.\"\n\nSiberian Times\n\n\"She is now officially 'out of danger' although no decisions have been taken on whether she will remain a zoo animal or go back to the wild.\"\n\nShe now has a new temporary enclosure with her own swimming pool, and as soon as she gains another 30-40 kg, a decision will be made about sending her back into the wild.\n\nClimate change has been damaging polar bears\u2019 sea-ice habitats and forcing them to scavenge for food on land. This has dragged them into the cities, bringing them in contact with human beings.\n\nWe're glad Marfa is feeling so much better. What we're worried about is, how many more Marfas are out there? Unable to find food because we messed up the planet a bit too much?", "description": "After observing it for a few days Russian experts concluded that it was too underweight and sick to survive alone in the wild.
