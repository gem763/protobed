This is almost a fifth higher than the offer from Amsterdam-based Takeaway.com.\n\nStill, the board of Just Eat rejected the overture from Prosus as it \u201csignificantly undervalues Just Eat and its attractive assets and prospects\u201d and recommended that shareholders do the same.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nJust Eat is the largest food delivery company in the UK but analysts have criticised its management\u2019s failure to capitalise on its early dominance of the rapidly growing sector, allowing nimbler rivals like Deliveroo to gain ground.\n\nIn its statement, aimed at Just Eat shareholders, Prosus said it believes the business will require substantial investment, over and above that planned by the company\u2019s management.\n\n\u201cJust Eat's third-quarter trading update demonstrated a significant slowdown in order growth, which highlights the need to accelerate this investment to sustain its competitive advantage,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cProsus does not believe that the proposed combination with Takeaway.com will fully or effectively address this investment need.\u201d\n\nJust Eat and Takeaway.com face tough competition from rivals with deep pockets such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo, which is backed by Amazon.\n\nThe bid from Prosus follows a string of foreign acquisitions of British companies. Earlier this year, US toymaker Hasbro bought the UK-listed owner of Peppa Pig, while Britain\u2019s biggest pub owner Greene King agreed to sell its entire business to CKA, a Hong Kong real estate group. Meanwhile, Fuller\u2019s, another UK pub group, sold its brewing business to Asahi, Japan\u2019s largest brewer.\n\nJust Eat\u2019s shares surged 20 per cent shortly after Prosus announced its offer and traded around 25 per cent higher on the day in the afternoon.\n\nNeil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, said: \u201cA bidding war is now on. You may need more like 750 pence [per share] to sort this out.\u201d\n\nHe added that a merger or a takeover of sufficient scale would create a company with the heft to take on Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Amazon.\n\nProsus already has other investments in the food delivery sector, including iFood in Latin America, Berlin-based Delivery Hero and Swiggy in India.", "description": "A bidding war has broken out over Just Eat as it rejected a \u00a34.9bn takeover offer from investment group Prosus, coming less than three months after the takeaway delivery company announced plans to merge with Takeaway.com.", "authors": ["Olesya Dmitracova"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/22/14/just-eat.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
