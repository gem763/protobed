gas as large crowds defy Hong Kong mask ban", "language": "en", "text": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Hong Kong police fired tear gas at pro-democracy protesters on Sunday after tens of thousands hit the streets once more to defy a ban on face masks despite half the city\u2019s subway stations remaining closed.\n\nLarge crowds marched through torrential rain in unsanctioned rallies on both sides of Victoria Harbour Sunday afternoon.\n\nClashes soon erupted as police fired tear gas at protesters blocking roads and building barricades in at least three different locations.\n\nProtesters have staged unsanctioned flashmob rallies across the strife-torn city in recent days \u2014 some vandalising subway stations and shops \u2014 after Hong Kong\u2019s leader outlawed face coverings at protests, invoking colonial-era emergency powers not used for half a century.\n\nPro-democracy lawmakers went to the High Court Sunday morning seeking an emergency injunction against the ban, arguing the emergency powers bypassed the legislature and contravened the city\u2019s mini-constitution.\n\nBut a senior judge dismissed their case.\n\nThe law allows the city\u2019s unelected pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam to make \u201cany regulations whatsoever\u201d during a time of public danger.\n\nShe used it to ban masks \u2014 which protesters have used to hide their identity or protect from tear gas \u2014 and warned she would use the powers to make new regulations if the unrest did not abate.\n\nThe ban was welcomed by government supporters and Beijing.\n\nBut opponents and protesters saw it as the start of a slippery slope tipping the international finance hub into authoritarianism.\n\nAnd it has done little to calm tensions or stop crowds coming out.\n\n\u201cIf Carrie Lam wants to de-escalate the situation, this is not the right way,\u201d a 19-year-old protester who gave his first name Corey, told AFP as he marched under a forest of umbrellas on the main island.\n\n\u201cCitizens are not afraid because of this law,\u201d added another protester, who gave his surname Leung and was dressed as a front-line protester.\n\n\u201cIt only causes more people to defy the ban.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Two teen protesters shot \u2013\n\nHong Kong has been battered 18 consecutive weekends of unrest, with widespread public anger over Chinese rule and the police response to protests.\n\nThe rallies were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions to the mainland, which fuelled fears of an erosion of liberties promised under the 50-year \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model China agreed ahead of the 1997 handover by Britain.\n\nAfter Beijing and local leaders took a hard line, the demonstrations snowballed into a wider movement calling for more democratic freedoms and police accountability.\n\nLam has refused major concessions but struggled to come up with any political solution, leaving police and demonstrators to fight increasingly violent battles as the city tips into recession.\n\nThe worst clashes to date erupted on Tuesday as China celebrated 70 years of Communist Party rule, with a teenager shot and wounded by police as he attacked an officer.\n\nA 14-year-old boy was then shot and wounded Friday night when a plainclothes police officer, who was surrounded by a mob of protesters throwing petrol bombs, fired his sidearm.\n\nThat night, masked protesters went on a rampage in dozens of locations, trashing subway stations and businesses with mainland China ties.\n\n\u2013 Much of subway shuttered \u2013\n\nThe city\u2019s subway system \u2014 which carries four million people daily \u2014 was shut down entirely Friday night and throughout Saturday, bringing much of the metropolis to a halt.\n\nMajor supermarket chains and malls announced they were closing, leading to long lines and panic buying.\n\nThousands of masked protesters still came out onto the streets throughout Saturday despite the mask ban and transport gridlock, although the crowds were smaller than recent rallies.\n\nOn Sunday, the subway operator said 45 stations would open but 48 remained shuttered, many of them in the heart of the city\u2019s main tourist districts as well as those areas hit hardest by the protests and vandalism.\n\nLam has defended her use of the emergency powers and said that she is willing to issue more executive orders if the violence continues.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow rioters any more to destroy our treasured Hong Kong,\u201d Lam said in a stony-faced video statement on Saturday.\n\nBut opposition lawmakers said the use of such a law had deepened the crisis.\n\n\u201cI would say this is one of the most important constitutional cases in the history of Hong Kong,\u201d lawmaker Dennis Kwok told reporters before Sunday\u2019s ruling.\n\nProtester demands include an independent inquiry into the police, an amnesty for the more than 2,000 people arrested and universal suffrage \u2014 all requests rejected by Lam and Beijing.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Hong Kong police fired tear gas at pro-democracy protesters on Sunday after tens of thousands hit the
