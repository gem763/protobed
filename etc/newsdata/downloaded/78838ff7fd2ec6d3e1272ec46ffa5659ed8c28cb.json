Photo-Illustration: Getty Images\n\nNow that both Hurricane Taylor Swift and the Grammy eligibility deadline have passed, all signs would normally point to quiet months ahead going into the holiday season. But nope! Old music-calendar convention is dead \u2014 expect artists across genres and rank to come out of summer hibernation and drop heat throughout the fall. (Climate change knows no bounds!) Here are the releases and tours to keep an eye on for the rest of the year, including Kanye West, Brittany Howard, Charli XCX, maybe Rihanna, and supposedly Adele (!).\n\nWhat We Think Will Be Great\n\nBy Craig Jenkins\n\nAugust\n\nBon Iver North American tour (8/31\u201310/19)\n\nBon Iver\u2019s recently released i,i treks further into the electroacoustic mood of 2016\u2019s 22, A Million. Catch front man Justin Vernon and his crew blowing minds in arenas this fall alongside a rolling list of openers including Feist, Sharon Van Etten, and Yo La Tengo.\n\nSeptember\n\nStereolab North American reunion tour (9/16\u201310/26)\n\nEuropean indie-rock outfit Stereolab, known for wigged-out \u201990s alt-rock highlights like 1996\u2019s Emperor Tomato Ketchup, has been on hiatus for a decade, but ringleaders Laetitia Sadier and Tim Gane got the band back together this year for a world tour to commemorate new reissues of the pristine back catalogue.\n\nBrittany Howard, Jaime (ATO Records; 9/20)\n\nAlabama Shakes leader Brittany Howard is a once-in-a-lifetime talent: a great writer, an expressive singer, and a formidable blues-rock guitarist striking out on her own with this September\u2019s Jaime, her first full-length billed as a solo album.\n\nOctober\n\nVagabon, Vagabon (Nonesuch Records; 10/18)\n\nCameroonian singer-songwriter Laetitia Tamko chases the scrappy DIY guitar rock of 2017\u2019s Infinite Worlds, her debut album as Vagabon, with October\u2019s sophomore effort, anchored by the lead single \u201cFlood Hands,\u201d a robust dream-pop tune that broke a bout of writer\u2019s block and opened up Tamko\u2019s sense of what was possible to do with the project.\n\nNovember\n\nThe 1975 North American tour (11/16\u201312/13)\n\nIf you can catch any of the ten dates in British pop group the 1975\u2019s tour of the States this fall, you should. The band\u2019s unruly deconstructions of pop, rock, and hip-hop are well worth braving the arenas hosting them in November and December.\n\nTBA\n\nTame Impala (Interscope; release date TBA)\n\nAustralian psych-rock one-man band Kevin Parker\u2019s flagship Tame Impala released new singles this year with the slick, funky \u201cPatience\u201d and \u201cBorderline.\u201d A new album seems imminent, and live dates in the summer and fall are not to be missed.\n\nWhat We Think Will Be Big\n\nBy Dee Lockett\n\nSeptember\n\nThe Highwomen, The Highwomen (Elektra Records; 9/6)\n\nAs a spiritual revisionist sequel to the Highwaymen (which consisted of Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson), country staples Maren Morris, Brandi Carlile, Natalie Hemby, and Amanda Shires have formed an all-female supergroup that\u2019s just daring country radio to shut it out.\n\nCharli XCX, Charli (Atlantic Records; 9/13)\n\nThough the standard album format once seemed a dead art to pop\u2019s foremost futurist, Charli XCX returns this fall with her third full-length, a self-titled collection of jams that aims to be a crystal ball for what the next five years of music might look and sound like.\n\nThe Lumineers, III (Dualtone; 9/13)\n\nThe biggest folk-rock band on the planet (sorry, Mumford & Sons) is back to cozy up to in these autumn months with this aptly titled third album. Sway and swoon accordingly.\n\nKanye West, Jesus Is King (G.O.O.D. Music/Def Jam; 9/27)\n\nIn true Kanye unpredictability, it appears he\u2019s scrapped or renamed the album formerly known as Yandhi for a project inspired by his ongoing Sunday Service series combining gospel revisions of his hits with church classics. His ninth solo album was announced via his wife Kim Kardashian West on Twitter with biblical song titles jotted down on a notepad \u00e0 la the Life of Pablo era.\n\nSturgill Simpson, Sound & Fury (Elektra Records; 9/27)\n\nThe alt-country renegade is venturing further into new terrain with this follow-up to 2016\u2019s Grammy-winning A Sailor\u2019s Guide to Earth. It\u2019s an unexpected psychedelic-rock-leaning companion album to a Netflix anime film (!) based on Simpson\u2019s original story.\n\nMadonna, Madame X tour at Brooklyn Academy of Music (9/17-10/12)\n\nThough you\u2019d typically find Madonna touring stadiums and arenas packed to the gills among tens of thousands, she\u2019s offering a rare opportunity to get up close and (probably way too) personal with a 17-date residency at BAM. She\u2019ll kick off her Madame X tour in support of her 14th album inside the Howard Gilman Opera House in September.\n\nOctober\n\nAngel Olsen, All Mirrors (Jagjaguwar; 10/4)\n\nAfter a two-album run of rising to the indie upper echelon (see especially 2014\u2019s Burn Your Fire for No Witness), the magnetic singer-songwriter is looking to three-peat with this ambitious, shockingly electric statement album.\n\nFKA Twigs, Magdalene (Young Turks; 10/25)\n\n\ufeffThe reclusive singer, celebrated for her striking visual artistry and brooding, aching experimental ballads, makes a long-awaited return with her sophomore album following health issues and a public breakup with Robert Pattinson. Catch her also as \u201cShy Girl\u201d in Shia LaBeouf\u2019s upcoming autobiographical film, Honey Boy.\n\nKing Princess, Cheap Queen (Zelig; 10/25)\n\nThe 20-year-old Brooklyn native born Mikaela Straus makes the leap from SoundCloud hits that get queer hearts racing (see: \u201c1950\u201d) to her lovelorn major-label debut album under Mark Ronson\u2019s imprint, Zelig.\n\nTBA\n\nRihanna (Release date TBA)\n\nOnly Rihanna knows when \u201c#R9,\u201d i.e., her ninth album, will arrive. (She has only vaguely promised it will do so before 2019 ends.) What we think we know: It will be her first full-length reggae record, and we definitely can\u2019t wait to rock steady to it.\n\nAdele, (Release date TBA)\n\nUniversal Music France\u2019s CEO spilled the beans that Adele is allegedly plotting to drop her fourth album this December, her first since 2015\u2019s commercial monster 25. What\u2019s more, this will be her first album since splitting with her husband, Simon Konecki, and her first since the big 3-0. Long may the queen of heartbreak ballads reign!\n\n*A version of this article appears in the September 2, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
