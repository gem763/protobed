Join the conversation below.\n\nIt is the first time Iran seems to have refused to cooperate with the IAEA\u2019s monitoring of its activities since the multination accord was implemented in January 2016. It comes as European powers, led by France, try to prevent the deal\u2019s collapse after the U.S. withdrew from the agreement in May 2018 and then reimposed tight sanctions on Iran, in violation of the deal. Until recently, the IAEA repeatedly said Iran was meeting all its commitments and cooperating with inspections.\n\nIranian officials in New York did not respond to a request for comment. Iran dismissed Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s allegations about the site last year.\n\nIran\u2019s behavior has sparked sharp debate in and around the IAEA, the diplomats said. The agency, they said, had recently told member states it would criticize Iran for not cooperating. But in a report released to member states on Friday, the agency made only a vague reference to the issue.\n\nThat decision could fuel criticism that the IAEA is playing down concerns to protect the 2015 deal.\n\nMr. Netanyahu last September urged the IAEA to immediately visit the site, expressing frustration the agency hadn\u2019t acted on his initial, private warnings. U.S. officials, rather than the IAEA, in July forced a debate in the agency\u2019s board of governors over Iran\u2019s decision to stop complying with all its commitments under the nuclear deal.\n\nThe IAEA\u2019s actions in this case \u201ccontinue a pattern of the agency\u2019s unwillingness to hold Tehran accountable for the violations of its nuclear safeguard obligations,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank which has opposed the Iran deal.\n\nThe diplomats caution that the radioactive material at the site is almost certainly not useful to Iran for amassing fuel for a nuclear weapon. They say it was likely left over from work Iran did years ago, which Western officials say was aimed at learning how to build a nuclear weapon. Iran says its nuclear program has always been for peaceful purposes.\n\nNonetheless, the secret establishment of the site and the storage of radioactive material there was likely a breach of Iran\u2019s international so-called safeguards commitments to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and material, a key pillar of the global nonproliferation system. Iran\u2019s past flouting of those commitments was the basis of the international sanctions regime developed from the mid-2000s against Tehran.\n\nIran\u2019s refusal to fully cooperate with the IAEA also appears to flout the cooperation it pledged to uphold with the agency under the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nAn IAEA spokesman said details of the agency\u2019s work are confidential. \u201cA rigorous technical and legal process is followed and any suggestion of internal differences...is strongly denied,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nFresh doubts about Iran\u2019s compliance come as senior Iranian officials on Monday traveled to Paris to continue talks on a French initiative to reduce tensions between Washington and Tehran by providing Tehran some relief from sweeping U.S. sanctions. After ten hours of talks, Iranian officials said Monday evening discussions would continue in coming days.\n\nIran began to breach some of its commitments under the agreement in July. Later this week, the country will say what next steps, if any, it will take to further reduce compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal in response to the U.S. withdrawal.\n\nMr. Netanyahu told the U.N. General Assembly last September that the Turquz Abad site had contained 300 tons of nuclear-related equipment, including as much as 15 kilograms of radioactive material. The allegation came months after Israel seized from an Iranian warehouse a trove of documents detailing Iran\u2019s past nuclear work. The site was cleaned out by the Iranians after Israel\u2019s seizure of the documents. It long predated Mr. Trump\u2019s May 2018 withdrawal from the nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cThe reason Iran didn\u2019t destroy its atomic archive and its atomic warehouse is because it hasn\u2019t abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said at the time. Trump administration officials have since echoed those remarks.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in April that agency inspectors had visited the Tehran site and taken samples of material to test. Western diplomats have confirmed Israeli media reports that traces of radioactive material were found when the results were reported early July.\n\nMany critics of the nuclear deal say it glossed over a real accounting of Iran\u2019s past nuclear work and so failed to establish how long it would actually take Tehran to produce a weapon once it amassed enough nuclear fuel.\n\nSupporters of the agreement say the IAEA and Western intelligence agencies already know much of what Iran had worked on. They argue it was more important to monitor and constrain Iran\u2019s future nuclear program.\n\nFor the IAEA, which strongly supported the 2015 deal, questions of how aggressively to investigate allegations of Iran\u2019s past actions have been awkward.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the IAEA Jackie Wolcott urged the agency in July to \u201cact upon any credible information\u201d that raises questions about Iran\u2019s fulfillment of its nuclear safeguards commitment.\n\nThe results from the samples come at a time of major flux at the IAEA, which is supposed to elect a new leader in October after its longtime Director General Yukiya Amano died in July.\n\nDiplomats said senior IAEA officials had indicated in briefings late last week they would expose Iran\u2019s lack of cooperation. In the end, the agency referred only obliquely to the issue.\n\n\u201cOngoing interactions between the Agency and Iran\u2026require full and timely cooperation by Iran,\u201d the agency said.\n\nWrite to Laurence Norman at laurence.norman@wsj.com", "description": "Iran is stifling a United Nations probe of its alleged storage of nuclear equipment and radioactive material, diplomats say,\u00a0leading to\u00a0fresh concerns about Tehran\u2019s nuclear activities at a critical moment.", "authors": ["Laurence Norman", "Laurence.Norman Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103332/social"}
