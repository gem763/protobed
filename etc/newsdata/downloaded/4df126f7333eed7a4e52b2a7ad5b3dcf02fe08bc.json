They also distilled the guiding mantra of the Trump administration. Others have tried to coin their own phrases (one senior administration official tried to make \u201cWe\u2019re America, bitch\u201d happen, and failed), but the real Trump doctrine is, \u201cGet over it.\u201d\n\nThe administration is forcing foreign governments into quid pro quos in order to assist Trump\u2019s political prospects? Get over it.\n\nIt\u2019s using the power of the presidency to financially benefit the president and his company? Get over it.\n\nIt obstructed justice and has announced its intention to do so again? Get over it.\n\nIt circumvented Congress\u2019s power of the purse to begin construction of a border wall? Get over it.\n\nIt separated children from families at the border, locking them in inhumane conditions? Get over it.\n\nThe president is evading Senate confirmation by naming \u201cacting\u201d officials to top posts? Get over it.\n\nRussia hacked the 2016 election? Get over it.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The scandal has spiraled out of Trump\u2019s control.\n\nAt the heart of this Trump doctrine is the presumption that any critiques of the president are born of bad faith, the result of Democrats (and perhaps some like-minded Republicans) who have never gotten over the fact that Trump won the presidency. Their objections to Trump\u2019s behavior must be sour grapes, not substantive; they need to at long last accept the results of the 2016 election. Trump himself talks about the election constantly, reveling in the memory even in stump speeches during the 2018 midterms and now in the 2020 presidential cycle.\n\nThere is a kernel of truth here: Many of Trump\u2019s opponents really haven\u2019t gotten over the 2016 results, and many are quick to call his presidency illegitimate. This does not, however, render substantive objections to his decision on policy and legal grounds void, nor does Trump\u2019s win mandate that Americans treat him with deference and loyalty.\n\nTrump is not the first president to try to argue that his election meant he ought to get his way. When, in January 2009, Republicans challenged Barack Obama\u2019s stimulus plan, the new president glibly replied, \u201cI won.\u201d But Obama soon learned it didn\u2019t work that way. Constrained by Republicans and by the law, he couldn\u2019t simply muscle his way through.\n\nAt times, Obama did test the bounds of legality. Having said that he couldn\u2019t unilaterally grant \u201cDreamers\u201d status to stay in the United States, he then turned around and did so. But more often, he tried to defend his moves on their substantive merits and convince the public to back him\u2014and he often failed, as he bitterly acknowledged.\n\nRead: Barack Obama blames the messenger.\n\nThe Trump administration doesn\u2019t bother with persuasion. Confronted with the lack of precedents for his behavior, the president and his aides shrug. Mulvaney could have argued that previous commanders in chief have done just what Trump did. (Trump himself has argued he is acting the same way Joe Biden did as vice president, but the analogy doesn\u2019t hold up.) He could have tried to offer a partial walkback, arguing that honest mistakes were made. Instead, he said everyone should get over it.", "description": "The administration has a single answer for every question about its policies and behavior.", "authors": ["David A.
