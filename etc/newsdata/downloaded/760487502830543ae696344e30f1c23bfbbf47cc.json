Based on their analysis of approximately 14,500 freshly minted Ph.D. recipients, the researchers conclude that a student who isn\u2019t redshirted could end up earning $138,000 more over the course of his or her lifetime than someone who is. Assuming redshirted students get their doctorates a year later than they would\u2019ve had they not had their schooling delayed, they get a year\u2019s head start on their salaries, which for a first-year Ph.D. recipient averages about $58,000. \u201cThe compounding effect\u201d of that $58,000, namely annual inflation over 30 years, causes that difference to accumulate.\n\nThese findings clearly offer striking contradictions to previous analyses. And in a way that only complicates efforts to draw conclusions about redshirting. After all, a lot can happen over the course of a child\u2019s educational trajectory: The age at which that child learns how to write the alphabet and count to 100 is just one among an infinite number of factors that could wind up determining his or her success, many of which are nearly impossible to control. Still, despite the cost of an extra year of childcare and the muddled research on its merits, parents continue to redshirt \u201cas a voluntary act to gain a comparative advantage,\u201d write Kniffin and Hanks, while others even time pregnancies to ensure their kids are relatively older than their peers.\n\nThe new study is compelling enough to suggest that all the kindergarten-age hullabaloo is, at the very least, a tad overblown. \u201cPeople who were or are relatively among the youngest in their classes shouldn\u2019t feel stigmatized or disadvantaged because of their age,\u201d Kniffin said, noting that he and Hanks deliberately made the study free for anyone to access to ensure laypeople can peruse its findings, too. \u201cWe would like to think that [with] this evidence, parents would feel a little less anxiety; it should provide a dose of anti-anxiety medicine for them.\u201d\n\nBut it seems unlikely that the new study will actually help parents loosen up as much as Kniffin would like. Many of today\u2019s savvy child-rearers are entrenched in a cycle that starts with what some have coined \u201cThe Rug Rat Race,\u201d employing a plethora of tactics aimed at giving their kids a competitive edge by the time they reach college. And in some ways that\u2019s often because they feel like they don\u2019t have much of a choice. Roughly half of all states now require schools to conduct kindergarten-readiness exams\u2014as do selective private schools, where even kindergarten can easily cost thousands of dollars in tuition. \u201cSo-called success in school is a high-stakes enterprise that weighs on the minds of parents from the time the baby is born, or even sooner,\u201d writes the Vanderbilt professor Stephen Camarata in his new book The Intuitive Parent.", "description": "When it comes to delaying kindergarten entrance, there\u2019s lots more at stake than a single child\u2019s competitive edge.", "authors": ["Alia Wong"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/08/kindergarten/facebook.jpg?1522839071", "published_at": "2015-08-13"}
