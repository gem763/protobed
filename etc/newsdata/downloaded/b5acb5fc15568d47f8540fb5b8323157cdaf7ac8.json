Tiger Woods announced on Tuesday that he has been in the process of writing his memoirs and now has a working title, Back as well as a publisher and an editor.\n\nThere have been two tomes penned under Woods\u2019s name before \u2013 How I Play Golf in 2001 and The 1997 Masters: My Story two years ago. However, Woods has always remained notoriously guarded and publications written independently have angered the 15-time major-winner, including those by former coach Hank Haney and former caddie Steve Williams.\n\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, Woods is labelling Back as his opportunity to tell the truth and nothing but truth. Obviously, this will be a tale that comes to fruition with his stunning comeback at the Masters in April \u2013 where he overcame a career-threatening spinal complaint to win his first major in 11 years \u2013 and will presumably include the ups and downs, featuring the sex scandal that ruined his world and reputation and the drug dependency that so almost signalled the end of his as a professional golfer.\n\n\"I've been in the spotlight for a long time, and because of that, there have been books and articles and TV shows about me, most filled with errors, speculative and wrong,'' Woods said in a statement.", "description": "Perhaps the most written-about sports superstar of the last two decades will at last release his own \u201cdefinitive account\u201d.", "authors": ["James Corrigan", "Golf Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2019/10/15/205943137_Getty-Images-Sport_Golf-The-Northern-Trust-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqKGqgzTaaaqb2TpaJGwel8y77Zcjp8zqpu2KP_ojOR2Q.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
