Those field goal and free throw percentages set career highs, and her 3-point rate was her highest mark since her rookie year.\n\nOnly eight NBA players have achieved this since the 3-point line was introduced to that league in the 1979-80 season. The \u201cclub\u201d includes the likes of Larry Bird, Steve Nash, Dirk Nowitzki, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant.\n\nWho made this video?! This is awesome. Totally humbled by this. I\u2019m so grateful to my teammates for being the best, and my Mystics family for all their support. It\u2019s been a great season so far, but it\u2019s not over yet!
