He managed to do so with a boarding pass but according to a statement from the Singapore Police Force, he was arrested because he had no intention of departing the country.\n\nChangi Airport\u2019s transit areas are considered \u201cProtected Places,\u201d meaning only those with the purpose of traveling are allowed inside.\n\n\u201cThose who misuse their boarding pass to enter into the transit areas, with no intention to proceed to their next destinations, are liable for an offense under the Infrastructure Protection Act,\u201d the police said in its statement.\n\nAuthorities deemed that the husband, in this case, overstepped his limits and misused the boarding pass. For this, he could be held liable for violating the Infrastructure Protection Act and face a penalty of not more than $20,000 SGD ($14,000 US), not more than 2 years imprisonment, or both.\n\nWho knew?\n\nAnd apparently, many others have done the same thing. Just this year, the police have arrested 33 people for the same violation.\n\nFind Meera on Twitter and Instagram.", "description": "Don\u2019t let rom coms fool you, airport goodbyes are not as romantic as they seem.", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "David Gilbert", "Meera Navlakha"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d68b08b07d38e000d25e801/lede/1567142099149-grahame-jenkins-PuW_TjHZwdY-unsplash.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.3745xh;0xw,0.1908xh&resize=1200:*"}
