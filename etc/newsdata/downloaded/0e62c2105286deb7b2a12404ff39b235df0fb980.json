Photo-Illustration: by Stevie Remsberg; Photo: Getty\n\nDoing the Most is a special series about ambition \u2014 how we define it, harness it, and conquer it. As part of the theme, we\u2019re interviewing successful women about what makes them so good at what they do.\n\nArguably the most feared and respected tech journalist in the business, Kara Swisher is such a household name that she played herself on HBO\u2019s Silicon Valley. (She\u2019s also one of the only reporters who can make Mark Zuckerberg sweat through his hoodie.) She began covering tech in the early \u201990s and later co-founded the news website Recode, which was acquired by Vox in 2015. Now, she writes a weekly column for the New York Times, produces two podcasts for Vox, appears regularly on CNBC, and hosts tech-world bigwigs at her Code Conference series. We spoke to her about being the best in her field, running for mayor of San Francisco, and having a baby at 56.\n\nWhen did you know that you were more ambitious than most people?\n\nFrom the beginning. Like, when I was very young. My mom always tells this story: I was in second or third grade, and I walked out of the classroom. I was like, \u201cI know this already. You\u2019re wasting my time.\u201d I definitely remember being bored in school and wishing things would go at a faster pace.\n\nWhat kind of reaction did that get?\n\nOh, people would say, \u201cIsn\u2019t that cute.\u201d Or, \u201cAren\u2019t you bossy,\u201d or any of the words they use for women who say what they want. I always said what I wanted from the beginning, and that continued throughout my career. There have been a lot of people, mostly men in positions of power, telling me I had to wait, that I shouldn\u2019t be so confident. And I was like, \u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019m the best you have.\u201d\n\nI was very declarative of my qualities. And I don\u2019t think I was being braggy. I won the journalism award in college when I was a freshman, and it was a senior award. I got a lot of pushback for it, which was weird. I was like, \u201cWell, too bad, I beat you.\u201d I don\u2019t care much for awards, though. I knew I was good already. I wasn\u2019t particularly competitive in sports, which is interesting. I didn\u2019t want to win in games, just work.\n\nHow did you figure out where to focus your ambitions?\n\nOriginally, I wanted to be an architect. But then, in high school, I went to a summer program at Harvard for architecture, and I was just bad. I don\u2019t have talent in design. I wish I could do it, but I didn\u2019t pursue it because I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be the best.\n\nI also wanted to go into the military, maybe to be in the CIA, and I couldn\u2019t because I was gay. That was more a function of the time. If I wasn\u2019t gay, I probably would\u2019ve become a spy. I think I would have been good at it. When they got rid of \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d I thought about joining the Reserves, but by that point I was too old.\n\nSo you went into journalism. Did you get a lot of pushback from your bosses when you were young?\n\nI got an internship at the Washington Post in my junior year of college. I was like, \u201cYou should hire me because I\u2019m better than the other people you have.\u201d And I kept saying that pretty much at every juncture of my career. I knew I was a good communicator and a good writer, and I wasn\u2019t shy. I think most people do know when they\u2019re good at things, and they do know their value, but then other people chip away at it. I don\u2019t have impostor syndrome.\n\nA lot of people have told me, \u201cYou should be more humble.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \"Why?\u201d\n\nA lot of people have said to me, \u201cYou should be more humble.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy?\u201d Bragging is different than saying what it is. When I suck at something, I say I suck at it. But I know what I\u2019m good at.\n\nWhere do you think you got your \u201cworld is my oyster\u201d mentality? Can you attribute it to anything?\n\nI love oysters, by the way. They\u2019re my favorite food. But anyway, I always knew I was lucky. I grew up in a wealthy environment. I have a lot of advantages. So I don\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about the struggles I have because I know that I am very lucky in lots of ways.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve never worried about what people thought of me, and I think part of that had to do with being gay. My feeling at the time was, Well, if they don\u2019t like me because I\u2019m gay, what\u2019s the difference? I think it frees you. If people don\u2019t like you for some inane reason, then why worry what they think? And if you don\u2019t worry about what people think of you, you can do almost anything.\n\nMy dad died when I was 5. I remember thinking, The worst thing ever happened to me and I\u2019m still here. Being aware of death tends to clear out the brush. Anytime I\u2019m having a minute, I remember, Oh, I\u2019ll be dead in 50 years. Okay. And then I stand up. I\u2019m not death-obsessed, but I\u2019m death-aware. It keeps me focused.\n\nI\u2019m not death-obsessed, but I\u2019m death-aware. It keeps me focused.\n\nYou\u2019ve had some notoriously bad bosses. How did you cope with them?\n\nI\u2019ve definitely been in abusive workplaces. But there are also types of bosses who try to hold you back a little bit, in small ways. I had one boss who, when I came back from maternity leave, said, \u201cI guess you\u2019ll need more time now.\u201d And I was like, \u201cFor what? It\u2019s not because I had a baby, right? Because it would be wrong for you to say that.\u201d He was so awkward. I said, \u201cI was the best before and I\u2019m still going to be the best.\u201d A lot of people would have let that kind of comment go, but I often say out loud what people are thinking. And in that case, there wasn\u2019t any cost to me because I really was good.\n\nDo you have high standards outside of work too? How does it affect your relationships?\n\nI don\u2019t know that I\u2019m ambitious in other parts of my life. I don\u2019t push my kids that much, especially compared to other parents. I have two wonderful boys, and I spend a lot of time with them. I\u2019m always like, \u201cDon\u2019t do your homework; it doesn\u2019t matter. Do this other thing instead.\u201d Their teachers hate me for it, but I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat? Is it not true?\u201d We try to help our kids with what they want to do, but you\u2019re certainly not going to see me bribing any colleges. We\u2019re much more hands off than you might imagine. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m particularly ambitious with my love life either. I was married for a long time, but then \u2026 Well, I\u2019m having a baby in November with my girlfriend, so I guess that\u2019s ambitious. You probably have to be pretty ambitious to have a baby at 56. I\u2019ve always wanted a girl, so I\u2019m excited. [Her girlfriend is carrying.]\n\nHas parenthood affected your ambitions at all?\n\nBecoming a parent didn\u2019t lessen my ambition, but it did make me more sanguine about work. It makes me spend even less time worrying about what people think of me. When something bad happens at work, or someone gives me a hard time, I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t need you to like me. I have dogs. I have kids. I need them to like me.\u201d If I fail at being a parent, I feel terrible, but if I fail at some work thing, I\u2019m like, Oh, well. Not everything\u2019s a four-alarm fire. If something goes wrong, a lot of people are like, \u201cWhat are we going to do!?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cSomething else.\u201d\n\nDoes your ambition ebb and flow at all?\n\nNo. I\u2019m more ambitious now than ever. I just thought of a new idea for something, and I told my girlfriend about it, and she was like, \u201cReally?\u201d I already have a lot of jobs, and she makes fun of me for it. But I like creating things. I really enjoy it. I think I\u2019m probably more entrepreneurial than most reporters. I always try to keep myself amused. Starting the podcast was part of that. A lot of people told me it wouldn\u2019t work and I just ignored them completely.\n\nI think I work harder than most people, certainly. Some people ask, \u201cWhy are you successful?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI work harder than you.\u201d I do have talent, but I also put in the time. I\u2019m not embarrassed about it either, and I don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s not important.\n\nWhen I had a stroke, everyone was like, \u201cOh, now you have to take time off.\u201d But I was fine. I did a video an hour later. I\u2019d never been sick at all, and it\u2019s not like any stroke is good, but it was the best stroke you could have, I guess. I recovered fully and immediately. And I love my work. It\u2019s not a choice between that and my personal life.\n\nDo you ever get tired?\n\nMaggie Haberman just asked me that. She was like, \u201cDo you ever get tired?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo.\u201d I just don\u2019t. I don\u2019t feel tired. And when I\u2019m tired I go to sleep. I\u2019m pretty energetic for someone my age, but I\u2019ve always had a lot of energy, and I think I\u2019ll be that way until I\u2019m dead.\n\nHow do you know when you\u2019ve taken on too much? Do you get overwhelmed?\n\nIf I can\u2019t do something well, I drop it. I write the column every week. I do five or six podcasts a week, at least. I do CNBC once or twice a week, and then I\u2019m working on events. But Vox lets me work from wherever I want. I can work at night and keep weird hours. I do take breaks. The other night I went to go see the new Gerard Butler movie by myself. I love all those Has Fallen movies, London Has Fallen, The White House Has Fallen. I don\u2019t know what it is about them, but I love them. So I just went by myself. I had a million other things to do, but I just wanted to see it. Someone asked me who I was going with, and I was like, \u201cMe.\u201d And then I was up really late last night working on my Times article. I work when I feel like it. Some mornings I take off, some mornings I don\u2019t. I calibrate my own schedule. There\u2019s no nine-to-five hours in my life. I\u2019m super anal-retentive, so I make lists and I\u2019m very organized.\n\nAlso, I say no a lot. Like, \u201cI won\u2019t do that. No, I don\u2019t want that.\u201d Women are made to feel that they should be a good girl or be accommodating, and they suffer for that. It\u2019s a societal thing. And men get to sit back and say no. The ability to say no is, I think, the greatest power of all time. And then saying yes at the right time, too.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about running for mayor of San Francisco. Is that still something you want to do?\n\nYes, I still think about it all the time. But we just got a new mayor, and I want to give her a chance. I don\u2019t want to step on her toes and be that asshole who just runs for personal ambition. Also, I\u2019m having a baby now, so I\u2019ll be on the East Coast more. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see. I do want to run for public office at some point. I\u2019ve just got to figure out when I can do it. Maybe when I\u2019m 70.\n\nHow do you celebrate your successes? Do you ever take a moment just to bask in it?\n\nI don\u2019t spend a lot of time high-fiving, just like I don\u2019t spend a lot of time agonizing when something goes wrong. I play the long game. I always say that to people when they\u2019re panicking. People are so panicked. I did Outward Bound twice, when I was 19 and 25, and the people who did well on Outward Bound were the ones who weren\u2019t panicking. There\u2019s sometimes reason to be worried, but most of the times people just panic instead. I\u2019m a super calm person, both when things are going well and when things are going badly. Of all the skills I have, my ability to move on is one of the keys to my success. I\u2019m like, \u201cNext!\u201d So I never feel defeated, in the same way that I never feel victorious.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited.\n\nStay in touch.
