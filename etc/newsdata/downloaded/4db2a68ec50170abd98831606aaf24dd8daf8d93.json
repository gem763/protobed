Ted Cruz (R-Texas) after he attempted to use the city as an example for why \u201cgun control doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nCruz on Monday, linking to a story on the far-right website Breitbart News about fatal gun violence in the city that took place over Labor Day Weekend, tweeted that \u201cdisarming law-abiding citizens isn\u2019t the answer.\u201d\n\nGun control doesn\u2019t work. Look at Chicago. Disarming law-abiding citizens isn\u2019t the answer.
