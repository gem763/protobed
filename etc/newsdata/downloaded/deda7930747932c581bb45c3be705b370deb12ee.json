and writing in the context of US politics, Michael Sandel talks about an impoverished discourse that lurches from one news cycle to the next, preoccupied with the scandalous, sensational and trivial.\n\nCloser to home, this must ring a bell.\n\nWhat we are witnessing in our political discourse, in addition to what Sandel has observed in the US context, is politics of hostility and anger, fear, hatred, vengeance, name calling, personal and counterattacks, and the venomous and the outright vulgar.\n\nIt is striking how many stagger around, obsessed with daily events, but choosing what would best serve their purpose and missing the underlying processes \u2013 systemic and structural rigidities.\n\nIncreasingly, political debate is characterised by people who neither listen to nor hear one another.\n\nParticipants often engage in indecent knee-jerk reactions without really having applied their minds.\n\nIn the book The Consciousness Revolution, which focuses on the importance of dialogue, Ervin L\u00e1szl\u00f3 states that participants in a dialogue must understand that what is being said is important to discuss \u2013 that there is something to be understood that is not yet properly understood.\n\n\u201cThey must realise that it is more important to understand the viewpoint of others than defend their own. If one can get beyond fondling one\u2019s own ego and understand that there is something to be achieved through dialogue, then there will be openness, more willingness to put aside petty concerns about \u2018whose point is it anyway?\u2019 Focusing on the issue is what should count,\u201d he writes.\n\nIf we do not understand what the problems are and what the solutions should be, we are lost in darkness and we will fail.\n\nThere is growing disregard for objective reality \u2013 the facts \u2013 when it does not serve the purpose.\n\nWe need to restore the love of intellectualism.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint a time since 1994 when there was such a dire need for the return to real politics \u2013 politics of equality, equity, justice and liberty and how these principles apply to particular situations in consolidating democracy, social and economic transformation, culture and technology.\n\nThe kind of politics that is injected with morality, which teaches that human beings have an inherent dignity worthy of respect.\n\nThe maxim do unto others as you would have them do unto you, cuts across different religious traditions.\n\nOur social contract, the Constitution, is clear on what should be our shared values and principles.\n\nBecause we have become engulfed by politics of preoccupation with the scandalous, sensational and trivial, if I may borrow from Sandel, it is extremely worrying how we are distracted from debating what really matters.\n\nLeaders who are bent on making statements and sending messages that polarise us, causing divisions instead of uniting us, can only be doing so in pursuit of self-preservation, which has nothing to do with what is in the common good.\n\nWe need to reject such politics and reach out to one another, pull together as a civil society.\n\nThis was demonstrated in a time of need \u2013 the scourge of gender-based violence in which the rape and brutal murder of Uyinene Mrwetyana became the last straw, enough is enough.\n\nThis clearly demonstrates the power of civil society, which is capable of driving leadership across the political spectrum to work together to find solutions.\n\nCivil action saw a joint sitting of Parliament and government announcing an emergency action plan with additional funding to deal decisively with gender-based violence.\n\nYes, implementation.\n\nThe vision of a caring and humane society requires a certain kind of politics, one that is based on principles of freedom, fairness, justice and equality; and has values that include compassion, truthfulness, solidarity and sacrifice.\n\nWe cannot hope for a new society, but we can behave and conduct ourselves in ways that are an antithesis to the society we\u2019re living in now.\n\nTsengiwe is former chief commissioner of the International Trade Administration Commission of SA\n\nTALK TO US There has been a degeneration of politics across the spectrum.
