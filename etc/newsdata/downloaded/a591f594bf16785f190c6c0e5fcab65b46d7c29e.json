USA TODAY\n\nGovernors are, in theory, the most powerful people in their states \u2013 or, at the very least, the most visible figureheads. They're responsible for implementing policies, managing budgets and signing bills into law.\n\nThey also earn only a fraction of what public school Football Bowl Subdivision coaches earn.\n\nAccording to USA TODAY Sports' annual review of coaches compensation \u2013 and governor salary data compiled by the nonpartisan, nonprofit Council of State Governments \u2013 governors will make about 6%, on average, of what the highest-paid public school coach in their state will make in 2019.\n\nGovernor salaries range from $90,000 to $201,000, according to the data, while coaching compensation at the FBS level typically exceeds seven figures, including salaries north of $5 million for elite coaches at Power Five schools.\n\nUNTOUCHABLE?: Many implications to Gus Malzahn\u2019s massive buyout\n\nSAY WHAT?: 6 surprising numbers from coaches salaries report\n\nPAY DAY(S): Every bonus earned by NCAA coaches in FBS so far this season\n\nClemson's Dabo Swinney, for example, leads the pack this year with a total compensation of $9.32 million. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, by comparison, will make a little more than 1% of that amount \u2013 about $106,000.\n\nIt's important to note that governors are elected public servants while college football coaches are employees in a free market ecosystem that allows different schools to compete for their services.\n\nHere's a look at the highest-paid coach in each of the 41 states that have an FBS football program and the governor salaries in those states.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.
