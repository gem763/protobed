Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s presidential campaign ever get going? For months, this has been the main question plaguing the candidacy of the high-profile senator whose pet issues seemed popular and whose anti-Trump voting record is unimpeachable. On paper, Gillibrand should have done better. And in a kind of bitter irony, that expectation became the very narrative that plagued her campaign on the trail. In June, the Atlantic\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere wrote a piece aptly titled \u201cThis Isn\u2019t Going According to Plan for Kirsten Gillibrand.\u201d In the piece he listed the personae of the major candidates and noted that with Gillibrand, \u201crather than being identified as the champion of women, or the crusader for reproductive rights or gay rights, she\u2019s becoming known as the one who can\u2019t break through.\u201d\n\nGillibrand told Dovere that she is used to being underestimated, and that this comes with the territory of being a woman in politics. But Gillibrand isn\u2019t just a woman in politics. She\u2019s a woman in politics who has staked her career on elevating and helping women. Her platform was centered on issues like paid family leave, reproductive rights, and fighting sexual harassment and assault. And yet, she never even caught on among women. Perhaps that shouldn\u2019t be surprising in the first field with multiple viable female candidates. Running for president is a long shot for everyone, and it\u2019s frankly a relief when any one of the candidates drops out of this overcrowded race. And yet, I can\u2019t stop wondering if we should attempt to glean something more from her lackluster performance, if not quite as much about Gillibrand as about ourselves.\n\nOne thing that stood out throughout her campaign was the way she refused to disguise or mask her femininity. Not only is she unmistakably blond, her voice consistently described as girlish, but she also showed up to both debates in brightly colored sheath dresses (no blazers) wearing sparkly earrings and (probably) fake eyelashes. It\u2019s as if she had simply acknowledged that the jig was up. \u201cYep, I am a woman!\u201d her self-presentation seemed to say. \u201cA very feminine one! And I\u2019m running on woman-centered issues! Is there a problem?\u201d The first time I saw her debate in May, I mentally applauded her for daring not to blend in with the other business-lunch women onstage. Then I thought, ruefully and self-critically: \u201cBut is it worth it?\u201d (The eyelashes, at least, looked very uncomfortable.)\n\nIt is impossible to know if Gillibrand\u2019s overtly feminine self-presentation, paired with her unapologetic stances on women\u2019s rights, was ultimately what held her back. In Dovere\u2019s candidate rundown, he noted that \u201cButtigieg is a smart young man, and Beto O\u2019Rourke is an inspiring young man.\u201d It\u2019s harder to imagine Gillibrand (all of six years Beto\u2019s elder) being anointed a similar sort of wunderkind. FiveThirtyEight helpfully noted that all women have to grapple with \u201cvoters\u2019 biases against women candidates,\u201d before acknowledging her other major trouble: the conflict she seems to have caused within the Democratic Party over her call for Al Franken\u2019s resignation. And as has been noted again and again, we really don\u2019t have any idea what it takes for a woman to win the presidency. There\u2019s no template for Gillibrand to meet\u2014or fail. No measurable evidence that a neutral blazer would have seen her through to the primaries.\n\n\u201cYep, I am a woman!\u201d her self-presentation seemed to say. \u201c\u2018A very feminine one! And I\u2019m running on woman-centered issues! Is there a problem?\u201d\n\nAnd yet I am perplexed by my own unenthusiastic reaction to her campaign, as much as it overlaps with the public consensus. As the warmer media reception to Jay Inslee proved, climate change is enough to be a single-issue platform. Why not women\u2019s rights? Part of this maybe has to do with the stuntlike nature of Inslee\u2019s campaign\u2014he was always pretty clear about his expectations around his candidacy, in a way that felt righteous and endearing. Inslee was also seen as selfless\u2014it\u2019s easier to think of climate change as a universal issue, not a personal one (however many times one can say women\u2019s rights are human rights). More of my confusion: I always took Gillibrand\u2019s run for president more seriously than Inslee\u2019s; at the same time I docked her campaign for never quite distinguishing her agenda from the other candidates\u2019, many of whom took similar aggressive stances on family leave and reproductive freedom. I evaluated her, in other words, as I would the real contender I\u2019d expected she would be. But I had to try to reconcile her obvious seriousness with shallower reactions on my part: I was annoyed that her debate performance felt a bit cloying\u2014she seemed to be constantly interrupting other candidates and blowing through her allotted speaking time. Did she do it more than others? Did that matter more than the fact that I felt she did?\n\nGillibrand has also been less able to temper the impression of her ambition (anyone running for president has it in spades) with the requisite humble origin story. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s own measurable drive is in some ways countered by her hardscrabble Oklahoman roots, lifting herself up by her bootstraps to become a law professor while raising two kids. Gillibrand spent 15 years as a Manhattan attorney, married a venture capitalist, and ran for Congress in the district where her grandmother had been a political powerhouse.\n\nShe got to the Senate when New York Gov. David Paterson appointed her to Hillary Clinton\u2019s seat after Caroline Kennedy turned him down. Her straight path to power makes it easy to forget she also won her special election in 2010 at the young age of 43, and she\u2019s one of two sitting senators to have given birth while in office (then-Rep. Gillibrand had her second son in 2008).\n\nThese triumphs earned her coverage in glossy magazines, including a 2010 Vogue profile now-ominously titled \u201cIn Hillary\u2019s Footsteps.\u201d As befits a Vogue profile, she looks extraordinary and reveals, with some prompting, that, while balancing the demanding schedule of a senator, she also managed to lose 40 pounds of post-pregnancy weight. That same year, Harry Reid called her the \u201chottest\u201d member of the Senate. (Gillibrand responded with her standard, measured disapproval, and it seems likely the experience played a part in her choice to focus on gender issues.) Her star rose meteorically and\u2014here I admit my own slight resentment\u2014she made it all look almost easy. She managed to pivot from being an upstate congresswoman with an A rating from the NRA to a lean-left senator in a span of less than 10 years while raising two kids. Why isn\u2019t that seen as more of a credit?\n\nShe managed to pivot from being an upstate Congresswoman with an A-rating from the NRA to a lean-left Senator in a span of less than 10 years while raising two kids. Why isn\u2019t that seen as more of a credit?\n\nThen there is her\u2014and Democrats\u2019\u2014ever-complicated relationship with the Clintons. Gillibrand cited Hillary as her inspiration for getting into politics, claimed her Senate seat, and maintained a close relationship for years. Then in 2017 she said she thought Bill Clinton should have resigned during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. This cost Gillibrand, in her relationship with her mentor certainly, and in donors. The upside was tougher to discern\u2014sure, people were relitigating Clinton\u2019s history with women at the time, but Gillibrand\u2019s willingness to take such an aggressive stance, and against her mentor\u2019s husband, seemed so unforced. And yet she was accused of #MeToo posturing. Was it really so crazy to think she was willing to say this simply because she believed it?\n\nThe bold statement on Clinton is also consistent with her now-notorious role in the resignation of Franken, another popular and powerful Democratic man. It\u2019s easy to forget that Gillibrand was only 20 minutes ahead of the other female senators who also somewhat immediately called for their colleague to resign from the Senate. But she has carried the bulk of the blame, in part because she has not backed down on her position while others have wavered.\n\nSo ultimately, here\u2019s what I think really happened: Kirsten Gillibrand was hurt by sexism, yes. But in singularly attaching herself to a political disaster of an issue\u2014a moral, legal, procedural morass we are still fighting over nearly every aspect of how to think about\u2014she refused to let us work around it. Sexual assault and harassment are issues of crucial importance, and there are few things that the nation has discussed more since the election of Donald Trump. They\u2019re just nowhere near enough\u2014as yet\u2014to determine a president.", "description": "She could have been a contender.", "authors": ["Susan Matthews"], "top_image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/bd347a4c-b52f-474a-9d3e-5f4b48eb016e.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=3245x2163&offset=0x0"}
