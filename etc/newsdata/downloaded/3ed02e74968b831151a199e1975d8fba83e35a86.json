REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\n\nLead Director David Calhoun, a senior managing director at Blackstone Group, will takeover as non-executive chairman, Boeing said on Friday, adding that the board had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Muilenburg, who will retain the top job and remain on the board.\n\nBoeing has been struggling to put its best-selling 737 MAX jet back in the air after two fatal crashes led to its global grounding in March.\n\nThe announcement came the same day an international aviation panel criticized U.S. regulators and Boeing over the certification of the plane.\n\nAn internal review in August revealed that the company was working to reorganize its engineering reporting lines company-wide and ensure higher ranking officials, including its CEO, get faster feedback about potential safety concerns from lower levels of the company.\n\nBoeing\u2019s board said on Friday it was working to ensure full support to Boeing\u2019s customers, and bring changes to sharpen the company\u2019s focus on product and services safety.\n\n\u201cThis decision is the latest of several actions by the board of directors and Boeing senior leadership to strengthen the company\u2019s governance and safety management processes,\u201d it said.\n\nIt also plans to name a new director with deep safety experience and expertise to serve on the board and its newly created Aerospace Safety Committee in the near term, Boeing said.\n\nEarlier this week, Reuters reported a key certification test flight would likely not take place until at least Nov. 1, a move that will push its approval to resume flights until at least December.\n\nOn Friday, United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL.O) became the latest U.S. airline to say it would not resume 737 MAX flights until January.\n\nShareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services Inc and Glass Lewis had urged Boeing to split the role of chairman and CEO in April, saying shareholders would benefit from a robust form of independent oversight.\n\nMuilenburg is set to testify before a U.S. House panel on Oct. 30. Lawmakers have raised questions about Boeing\u2019s actions prior to the 737 MAX certification.", "description": "Boeing Co said its board had stripped chief executive Dennis Muilenburg of his chairmanship title, as the U.S. planemaker works to return its 737 MAX jet to service.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439863780&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A27Y", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
