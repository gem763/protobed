To ensure that companies using temp agency workers are held financially responsible for workplace deaths and injuries under WSIB, regulations were drafted in 2018, but still await the Premier\u2019s signature to be implemented.\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s occupation comes following the death of Enrico Miranda, the 57 year-old father of two, who was killed on September 25 at Fiera Foods. Miranda was the 5th temporary agency worker to die on the job at Fiera Foods, and the 2nd since Premier Doug Ford took office.\n\nWHAT: A media briefing with community and labour leaders\n\nWHEN: Wednesday, October 16 at 5:00 pm (the occupation has begun, and will continue indefinitely)\n\nWHERE: Doug Ford\u2019s constituency office at 823 Albion Road in Etobicoke\n\nVISUALS: Signs bearing the names of the five temp agency workers who were killed at Fiera Foods, flowers, candles, an oversized poster of Section 83(4) for Premier Doug Ford to sign, community and labour leaders who will share stories of how this issue impacts them.\n\n\u201cPremier Doug Ford has left us with no other choice, but to start this occupation today,\u201d said Chris Buckley, President of the Ontario Federation of Labour. \u201cHad Ford implemented Section 83(4) of WSIA, companies like Fiera Foods would be held fully financially responsible for the injuries to temp agency workers. This tragic death could have been prevented. It is time for companies like Fiera Foods to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nIn Ontario, temp agency workers are twice as likely to get hurt on the job, compared to directly hired employees. This is due to an ongoing loophole that shields companies from the cost of injuries suffered by the temp agency workers they hire.\n\n\u201cLegislation already exists to stop companies from treating temp agency workers\u2019 lives as disposable,\u201d says Deena Ladd, Executive Director of the Workers\u2019 Action Centre. \u201cAll Premier Ford needs to do is to add his signature so it can be enacted. This is a matter of life and death.\u201d\n\n\n\nLast week, the Ontario Federation of Labour, Workers\u2019 Action Centre, Jane Finch Action Against Poverty and Fight for $15 & Fairness issued an open letter to Premier Doug Ford demanding he immediately enact of Section 83 (4) of WSIA. To date, there has been no response.\n\nFord\u2019s refusal to take action to prevent further workplace deaths in Ontario has provoked this indefinite occupation of his office today, with the support of Unifor, CUPE Ontario, Elementary Teachers of Toronto, Ontario Network of Injured Workers, and the Toronto York Region Labour Council, among other community and labour groups.\n\nFor latest action updates, look for #OccupyFord on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram .\n\nFor more information or to arrange interviews:\n\nNil Sendil\n\nCommunications Coordinator, Fight for $15 & Fairness\n\ninfo@15andfairness.org l 647-710-5795\n\nMeagan Perry\n\nDirector of Communications, Ontario Federation of Labour\n\nmperry@ofl.ca l 416-894-3456\n\nThe Fight for $15 and Fairness is a growing movement of workers committed to fighting for decent work, and includes anti-poverty activists, health providers, labour groups, students, faculty, and faith leaders.
