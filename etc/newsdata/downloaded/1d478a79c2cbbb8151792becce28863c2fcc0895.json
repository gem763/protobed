But there were roadblocks in many other neighborhoods.\n\nA general strike paralyzed Santa Cruz in the east and the mining city of Potosi in the southeast.\n\nOn Sunday, Morales claimed the opposition was preparing for a \u201ccoup d\u2019etat.\u201d\n\nAt the center of the conflict was a sudden and unexplained change in the ballot count last Monday that boosted Morales\u2019s lead, pushing him over the 10-point margin of victory required to avoid a run-off.\n\nMesa has denounced the official results while various foreign powers, including the European Union and United States, have called for a run-off.\n\nThe Organization of American States (OAS), voicing \u201csurprise\u201d and \u201cconcern\u201d over the ballot count, has agreed to conduct an audit of the results.\n\nMorales, Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president, has been in power since 2006.\n\nAlready Latin America\u2019s longest-serving leader, he is looking to remain in power until 2025 with a fourth term.\n\nBolivia\u2019s constitution limits a president to two successive terms, and a 2016 referendum rejected a bid by Morales to remove term limits.\n\nBut the country\u2019s constitutional court authorized him to stand for a fourth mandate.\n\nThe court, like the election tribunal, is made up of members appointed by Morales\u2019s Movement for Socialism.", "description": "La Paz (AFP) \u2013 Street battles broke out on Monday between supporters of President Evo Morales and opposition leader Carlos Mesa, leaving dozens", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/80d098_protesters-block-street-in-la-paz-as-opposition-demonstrations-president-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
