Former Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans told The Mail on Sunday that her response was 'not good enough'.\n\nHe hit out: 'Baroness Hale could have immediately said at the time, \"I do not support that set-up and I am not someone who can enter the political field to denigrate the Prime Minister.\" But she did not, instead she just went along with it, cracking jokes.'\n\nThe senior Tory added: 'It is not good enough that she did not call it out and stress her independence. Baroness Hale must not only be impartial but at all times appear to be impartial.'\n\nIn a separate development yesterday, close connections emerged between the top judge and Labour's Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti, who claims: 'I've spent a lot of my life being inspired by older role models like Brenda Hale.'\n\nThe judgment to reverse Boris Johnson's prorogation of Parliament was celebrated by many Labour MPs for turning attention away from the party's infighting at their annual conference.\n\nAppearing at a Labour Lawyers fringe event, Baroness Chakrabarti spoke highly of her fellow peeress, declaring: 'All Hail to Brenda Hale!' in response to the Court's judgment that morning.\n\nDespite being named as a Labour peer in August 2016, Baroness Chakrabarti has still appeared at at least two events alongside Hale, who became Supreme Court President the following year.\n\nThey spoke together at an LSE event in February 2018 to celebrate female enfranchisement. Baroness Hale referred to Chakrabarti as a 'sensible woman' from the podium.\n\nThe pair appeared again at a Justice fundraising event in June.\n\nNo mention of this was made when, three months later, Chakrabarti was one of those who submitted evidence to oppose Boris Johnson's plans to prorogue Parliament.\n\nHowever links between the two began years earlier when Chakrabarti was serving as director of the Liberty pressure group from 2003 to 2016.\n\nThe two appear to have met regularly at events such as Liberty's Human Rights Awards in 2011 and the opening of the Lady Hale Building at the University of Salford in 2010.\n\nIn her 2014 book On Liberty, Chakrabarti praised Hale as 'an acute legal mind' who possesses 'considerable human understanding' before naming her as one of the three women who inspired her career two years later.\n\nIn July 2016, she told The Times: 'The great legal women who inspired my career were Helena Kennedy, Juliet Wheldon and Baroness Hale.'\n\nLast night, a Labour source insisted Baroness Chakrabarti was merely an admirer of a fellow female in the legal world, but legal sources said the pair were 'great pals'.", "description": "Baroness Hale stunned the legal and political worlds two weeks ago with her brutal slapdown of Mr Johnson's bid to suspend Parliament for five weeks.
