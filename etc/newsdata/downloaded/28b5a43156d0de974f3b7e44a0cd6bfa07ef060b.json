Google has since clarified its policies and said it will make it more explicit that people must give explicit permission, or opt in.\n\nStill, many are sceptical of the proliferation of digital assistants in homes and pockets.\n\nThe new phone gets a second camera lens, for better zooming. AP\n\nWith the new Pixel, the Google Assistant will complete some tasks entirely on the device - so it doesn't have to wait for answers from the cloud - allowing users to make commands and dictate text messages more quickly.\n\nThe Pixel 4 will have better facial recognition for unlocking the phone with a glance. Unlike the existing \"trusted face\" feature on Android phones, the new Face Unlock is intended to be more secure and easier to use, matching what Apple and Samsung already offer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new phone gets a second camera lens, for better zooming, even as some Apple and Samsung devices are getting a third lens, for wider-angle shots. True to Google's focus on AI, the Pixel's new camera will recognise people you have taken many photos of before and automatically focus on them in new shots.\n\nAnd the new phone comes with motion-sensing technology that allows people to do simple hand-waving gestures to skip songs or switch apps without touching the phone.\n\nThe Pixel 4 will carry a starting price tag in Australia of $1049 for 64GB and $1199 for 128GB, whereas the larger XL version will start at $1279 for 64GB and $1429 for 128GB. They will go on sale on October 24.\n\nGoogle's phones have been well reviewed, but have yet to make much of a splash in the market dominated by Apple, Huawei and Samsung. In fact, Google's hardware products have never been big money makers. Rather, they offer a way for Google to showcase its money-making services.\n\nGoogle introduced a less expensive version of its phone, the Pixel 3a, to positive reviews in May, a trend that is sweeping across the smartphone market as consumers hold on to phones longer rather than buy new, expensive models. Google hinted the trend may continue, but offered no details.\n\n\"We see that being a really great long-term opportunity, both for our users and for us,\" said Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of hardware at Google\n\nEarbuds, smart speakers and routers\n\nThe company also unveiled true wireless earbuds, called Pixel Buds, Google's answer to Apple's AirPods. The new model, which will go on sale early next year for $179, does away with the wire that connects the two buds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle introduced Nest Mini, the smaller version of its smart speaker. It comes out next Tuesday for $49. Google's refreshed Wi-Fi router, Nest Wifi, will be available in the coming weeks for $269. A new Pixelbook Go laptop goes on sale in January staring at $649.\n\nOn Wednesday morning Telstra announced that it had a partnership agreement with Google that meant any customers buying a new Pixel phone would get a Google Nest Hub for free.\n\nOptus meanwhile said that any of its customers would get a free Google Assistant enabled Harman/Kardon Citation ONE speaker valued at $299 if they buy a Pixel 4 outright or on a plan before December 31.\n\nGoogle's hardware team, including many former Google Glass engineers, work from a light-filled, architecturally impressive building near the company's main campus in Mountain View, California.\n\nThe building is complete with a \"colour lab\" for finding the perfect device hues, a materials library for all sorts of elemental inspiration and a small model shop to build device prototypes on site.\n\n\"We started by defining what it feels like to hold Google in your hands,\" hardware design executive Ivy Ross said. \"The good thing about coming a little bit late to the hardware arena is you get to stand back and look at everyone else.\"\n\nOne of the challenges this time around was finding a way to make the products more sustainable, a feat especially notable on the Nest Mini, which has a \"fabric\" casing made of yarn created from plastic water bottles.\n\nThe Google Nest Mini speaker at the Made by Google event in New York on Tuesday.
