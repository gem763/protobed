Just 20 years old, the illustriously co-signed skater -- who\u2019s currently fronting the latest issue of i-D -- has transcended his homely New Jersey-cum-The Bronx upbringing to become an international superstar on the scene.\n\nHaving been spotted throughout the city\u2019s many skateboarding hangouts, turning heads as a kid for his unwavering resilience and dedication to the sport (\u201cHe just kept on going,\u201d his mother says), Jones\u2019s life story epitomises what it means to be young and ambitious in America. He got his big break in Supreme\u2019s 2014 clip \u201cCherry\u201d, in which he infamously ollie flipped into the New York Court House. In skateboarding circles it was, as his friend filmmaker Bill Strobeck tells us: \u201cA super big deal\u201d. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nSince then, TJ (as his closest friends call him) has had an insane five years, with everything from killer Adidas deals to being crowned Thrasher\u2019s Skateboarder of the Year for 2018 (the final selection by the magazine\u2019s late editor Jake Phelps). He\u2019s also found time to open his own food joint - Taste So Good! - in the Bronx to give back to the community he came from. All this attributed to a kid who\u2019s not yet old enough to buy a beer.\n\nTo get to grips with Tyshawn\u2019s story, directors Matt Irving and Kirk Dianda went to New York to spend time with the man himself, as well as those who\u2019ve been around him since the very beginning. It\u2019s all here to see in the world\u2019s first and most comprehensive documentary on Tyshawn\u2019s life.\n\nEverybody from his own mum to skateboarding royalty like the Lizard King, Tony Hawk and Silas Baxter-Neal make appearances in the movie, which you can stream in full right here. Take note: if you have your sights set on making it big in the skating world, Tyshawn Jones has re-written the blueprint.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "Get the lowdown on the life of New York City\u2019s skateboarding king.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9deadca72477000ac73748/lede/1570631182785-2019-10-09-1.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
