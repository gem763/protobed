A coalition of Western forces led by the United States dropped cluster bombs on the head and tail of the retreating column. Then it began to bomb the convoy. The soldiers who survived, many of them conscripts, walked home in a driving rain. Smoke from the Kuwait oil fields set fire by Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces mingled with storm clouds and black rain fell on the soldiers as they shambled home defeated. President George H.W. Bush declared victory and an end to hostilities two days later.\n\nMidway through the new Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, I sat nestled in a sniper\u2019s nest overlooking the Highway of Death. In Modern Warfare, this is not the road between Kuwait and Iraq but a highway leading from a city into the mountains of the fictional country of Urzikstan. Viewed through the scope of my rifle, Call of Duty\u2019s Highway of Death\u2014with its burnt out cars, gray dust, and cracked road\u2014looks exactly like photographs of Iraq\u2019s Highway of Death.\n\nThe actual \"Highway of Death.\" Photo courtesy of U.S. Air Force.\n\nWe\u2019re told in a cutscene that, during its invasion of this fictional country, Russia bombed the highway killing people trying to escape. Just like that, in a piece of popular fiction, American atrocities become Russian atrocities. It\u2019s the kind of distance players need to separate themselves from history, to watch the road uncritically through a scope, and place bullets downrange so that their enemies head\u2019s satisfyingly explode. It\u2019s a fun mission.\n\nIn his assessment of Call of Duty, my colleague Emanuel Maiberg said Urzikstan is \u201cso blatantly based on Syria that it\u2019s cowardly to call it anything else.\u201d I think it\u2019s more complicated. In the minds of most Americans, the Forever War exists in a nebulous country Over There. We\u2019re fighting in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and North Africa. But all these places are treated as interchangeable.\n\nIn the popular imagination, the mountains of the Korengal Valley are next to the Tigris and Euphratesrivers, across the street from the tank graveyards of Syria, downriver from the poppy fields of Kabul, and a just a quick drive down the Cairo\u2013Dakar Highway. The popular and political imagination can no longer tell them apart\u2014hell, it never could\u2014and popular art is not attempting to make a distinction.\n\nIn Call of Duty, Urzikstan is an Ur-Country; a prototypical Over There that developer Infinity Ward can layer historical events on. It\u2019s a country Russia invaded and has occupied for two decades. Farah Karim, one of the game\u2019s principal protagonists is modeled on Kurdish freedom fighters . Though her real world origins feel Syrian, her back story and fight\u2014dislodging an imperial power occupying her home\u2014are Afghan.\n\nIn Call of Duty\u2019s two most emotionally impactful missions, I played through Farah\u2019s childhood. She wakes up in the rubble of a building after a Russian airstrike, her dead mother staring at her. She escapes through the ruined streets of her home, dodging Russian soldiers and avoiding the gas of an unnamed chemical weapon. In the final moments of the first mission, she sneaks through fields of poppy while snow capped mountains loom in the distance. Both are features of Afghanistan.\n\n\"In the minds of most Americans, the Forever War exists in a nebulous country Over There. We\u2019re fighting in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and North Africa. But all these places are treated as interchangeable.\"\n\nRussia invaded and occupied Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. It used chemical weapons\u2014though not on the scale depicted in Call of Duty\u2014and devastated the landscape with air strikes. But America has been in Afghanistan far longer, almost two decades with no real end in sight, and though it didn\u2019t use chemical weapons, it has killed civilians in airstrikes. The highest profile attack being the destruction of a Doctor\u2019s Without Borders hospital in Kurduz which killed 42.\n\nUrzikstan is also Libya. On September 11, 2012, Islamist group Ansar al-Sharia attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. The fighters killed four Americans. In Urzikstan, the destruction was more wanton and dozens of innocent embassy personnel died as I moved through Call of Duty\u2019s stand in for the Benghazi Consulate, putting round after round into al-Qatala\u2014the game\u2019s stand in for al-Qaeda\u2014bodies. It\u2019s the best mission in the game.\n\nAmerica is at war, by any reasonable definition, in at least seven different countries. The real total may be higher, but it is hard to say given how much information is still classified. American troops fight in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, and Niger. It\u2019s also conducting support and surveillance operations in places such as the Philippines, where the Islamic State has a foothold.\n\nBut back home, all those wars are Over There. Iraq is Afghanistan is Libya is Syria. It\u2019s all \u201cSand and death,\u201d as the President said. The distinctions between the fight against al-Shabab in Africa and the Taliban in Afghanistan don\u2019t exist. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare exploits these historical moments and turns them into high quality entertainment for the people back home, who don\u2019t want to think about Over There unless it\u2019s about How We\u2019re Winning or How It's Not Our Fault. The distinctions between the conflicts, the countries and their people, are lost. It\u2019s all Over There. It\u2019s all the War.\n\nIn America, history repeats first as a video game.", "description": "Like the United States itself, 'Modern Warfare' can't tell its wars apart and doesn't bother trying.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db88db483b16900914ffb95/lede/1572376183100-1920x-1.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
