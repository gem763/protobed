On Sunday, he played in a Rugby World Cup match.\n\nManu got his moment off the bench in Tonga\u2019s opening game of the World Cup against England in Sapporo.\n\nTonga lost 35-3 but got some inspiration by seeing the loose forward come off the bench to complete his recovery from testicular cancer that saw him undergo emergency surgery, months of chemotherapy and miss all international rugby last year and most of this season.\n\nIt was Manu\u2019s first game back for Tonga since his cancer diagnosis and his wife and two-year-old daughter came to Japan to watch him.\n\n\u201cThe whole day has been very difficult for me, just controlling the nerves,\u201d Manu said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep last night, I just got too excited. I was telling my wife that I didn\u2019t know what to do. I packed my bags five times.\u201d\n\nManu shed tears at a welcoming ceremony for the Tongan team at the World Cup last week. He said the tears flowed after he realized how far he\u2019d come from last year, when he was fearing for his life and his rugby career was secondary.\n\nThere were more when he lined up and sang Tonga\u2019s national anthem on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThey were plenty of them, but then I had to calm down,\u201d he said.\n\nTonga coach Toutai Kefu said he\u2019s planning to give Manu a gentle introduction back to international rugby and manage his game time.\n\n\u201cWe all knew as a group that this was important for him,\u201d Kefu said. \u201cI just had a chat to him and he said he was very tired, he needed more game time, and his lungs were gone.\n\n\u201cBut I reassured him, I said \u2018Mate, you\u2019re lucky to be back out on the field.\u2019 I think that\u2019s the first step.\n\n\u201cBut knowing Nasi, he\u2019s a very competitive person and he wants to give 100 percent,\u201d Kefu said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good player on and off the field. An important member for us.\u201d\n\nManu said his \u201clegs were gone\u201d and he had to battle it out to play the rest of the 33 minutes he was on the field.\n\n\u201cNo fitness can prepare you for that. I have achieved my dream of playing in a World Cup whatever happens and I have so many people I can thank for getting me here.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say names because I am afraid I will miss some out.\u201d\n\nSome of the people Manu has already thanked are his teammates at Italian club Benetton Treviso who shaved their heads in support of him when he was undergoing chemotherapy and sent him cellphone videos to keep his spirits up. His club also helped him get treatment.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There were times not long ago when Nasi Manu was too sick and weak from the chemotherapy to walk up the steps at a stadium and watch a game of rugby.
