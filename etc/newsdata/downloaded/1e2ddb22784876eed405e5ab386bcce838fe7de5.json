The format involves object-based spatial audio that places various elements of a music track around the listener in a virtual spherical environment. The experience is designed to replicate live music, with instruments and vocals coming from different directions.\n\nAt launch, there will be around 1,000 songs available in 360 Reality Audio, including tracks from artists like Pharrell Williams, Bob Dylan, and Billy Joel. Sony has also captured live performances from artists such as Charlie XCX and Kodaline and converted them to the new format. Sony will of course be able to leverage music from its own record label, but the company says it\u2019s also working with Universal, Warner, and Live Nation to add more content.\n\nSony has partnered with Amazon Music HD, Deezer, and Tidal\n\n\u201c360 Reality Audio is a proof point that innovation never stops,\u201d Sony Electronics (North America) president and COO Mike Fasulo said in a press release. \u201cThe confluence of deep technical roots, tireless artists and forward-thinking hardware and semiconductor partners illustrates the tremendous draw of this radical new way to make music even more moving. Together with valued industry partners, Sony has architected the most powerful, realistic music experience for listeners and a new medium for artists to create.\u201d\n\nAs for how you\u2019ll actually get to listen to 360 Reality Audio, Sony has partnered with Amazon Music HD, Deezer, Tidal, and nugs.net. That\u2019s bad news for Spotify or Apple Music users, then, but Sony does call out Amazon\u2019s promising new Echo Studio as a way to play back this music natively. Other speakers will require Sony\u2019s 360 Reality Audio decoder along with \u201cmultiple speaker units and signal processing technology,\u201d so it\u2019s unlikely that this\u2019ll work for many existing setups.\n\nHowever, at launch the only mobile app support will come through \u201cheadphones from most manufacturers\u201d when used with the Tidal, Deezer, and nugs.net iOS and Android apps. Certain recent Sony headphones will also be able to produce a \u201ccustom immersive musical field\u201d through the Headphones Connect app, although it\u2019s not clear how exactly that\u2019ll work with external content.\n\nThis will clearly be something that needs to be experienced in person to judge. Sony does appear to be making its best effort to make this a thing, but the same could have been said of various Sony-backed formats in recent decades. The news that it\u2019ll work on Amazon\u2019s new high-end Echo gives it a pretty good use case right out of the gates, though, and we\u2019re looking forward to hearing more.", "description": "Sony has announced that its new 360 Reality Audio technology will launch in late fall with several partners.
