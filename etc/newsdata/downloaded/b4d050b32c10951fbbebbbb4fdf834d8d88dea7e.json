who were all now at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nInvestigating officers will be examining post-mortem evidence and seeing whether distinguishing features such as teeth, tattoos, marks or scars could help with the identification process.\n\nWhile emphasising that he could not confirm the nationality of any victim, Mr Pasmore said information had been flowing into the casualty bureau at Essex Police from the Vietnamese community in the UK and abroad.\n\nHe explained that while fingerprint data could be gathered from Vietnam, accessing information from the UK Vietnamese community was a more \"complex scenario\".\n\nMr Pasmore said: \"It may well be that there are people watching this tonight that are thinking 'I'm here in the UK and I'm here illegally and I want to come forward, I want to obviously try and identify my loved ones and be reunited', but they are frightened to come forward.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe explained he had met with a \"facilitator\" of one of the websites used by Vietnamese people to help build trust between the community and the police.\n\nMr Pasmore said he hoped it would help encourage people to \"take that leap of faith\" and make contact with his officers.\n\nHe added: \"If you come in to us we will do everything we can to put our arm around you, take you through this process, identify as quickly as possible to see whether or not we do indeed have one of your loved ones involved in this tragic incident.\"\n\nMr Pasmore said investigating officers may have to try and track down families to get DNA comparisons to help identify the victims.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nLinks have also been established with Vietnamese officials in the UK, with Mr Pasmore meeting the country's ambassador on Saturday morning.\n\n\"We are building a really good and rapid rapport,\" Mr Pasmore said.\n\nHe added: \"We are already agreeing a method of sharing fingerprints which may be a fast-track method of identifying some of our victims.\"\n\nIn a statement Essex Police said: \"We have over 500 exhibits, including mobile phones which have to be downloaded and the interrogation of mobile phones will be important for identifying the victims but also assisting the wider investigation - this needs to be done in forensic way so it will pass the evidential process for court later.\"\n\nThe Vietnamese embassy in London said the pair had a conversation over the phone late on Friday evening.\n\nIn a statement, the embassy said it had affirmed a \"willingness to exchange information and to coordinate\" with British authorities to help identify the victims.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe ambassador and embassy officers visited Grays in Essex on Saturday morning and held meetings with the local authority and Essex Police.\n\nThe embassy said it would take time for the investigation to \"acquire sufficient confirmation from biometric and DNA data of the victims\".\n\nIt said there had been no official confirmation of the identity of the victims.", "description": "Mo Robinson was arrested in Grays, Essex, by Essex Police officers shortly after the bodies of 39 migrants were found in a lorry", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Pa", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20707489.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_THP_CHP_231019SLUG_6905JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
