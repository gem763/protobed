Tehran senses America is bluffing and doubles down, increasing the amount of naval and missile forces in the area. Additionally, Iran tests several new ballistic missiles that could, in theory, sink a U.S. naval warship.\n\nAmerica then strikes hard, making sure that if military force is going to be used, Washington gets the maximum amount of benefit with such an escalation. U.S. forces in the region attack with a series of cruise missile strikes from U.S. nuclear attack submarines sitting offshore. The attacks focus on clearing out the strait of Iranian naval assets and damaging Tehran\u2019s nuclear and missile infrastructure.\n\nAt first, it seems the move is a resounding success. But then Iran decides that America must pay a price for its actions, with an attack on the symbol of U.S. military might, a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier that is operating in the region.\n\nIran launches a salvo of over 100 missiles, the U.S. carrier\u2019s defenses are overwhelmed, and the 100,000-ton vessel is destroyed and 2,000 America\u2019s die \u2013 the worst loss of U.S. lives since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.", "description": "", "authors": ["Harry Kazianis", "Foxnews.Com Opinion Harry-Kazianis-Trump-Wise-To-Avoid-A-Devastating-War-With-Iran-In-Wake-Of-Attack-On-Saudi-Arabia"], "top_image": ""}
