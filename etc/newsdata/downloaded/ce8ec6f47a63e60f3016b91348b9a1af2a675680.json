As a result, the NBA's relationship with China has become strained, forcing those inside the league to provide their thoughts on the matter.\n\nKerr told reporters he didn't feel well-versed enough to provide an informed opinion:\n\nSpeaking from the Roosevelt Room at the White House, Trump said Kerr \"was like a little boy.\"\n\nWarriors star Stephen Curry responded to Trump's comment, per The Athletic's Anthony Slater: \"Just heard about the Trump thing. Gotta welcome Steve to the club.\"\n\nCurry drew Trump's ire in September 2017 when made it clear he didn't want to visit the White House to celebrate the Warriors' championship victory the previous season.\n\nShortly after Morey's tweet, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said Morey's views didn't reflect those of the team:\n\nThe fallout has extended beyond just the Rockets to the league as a whole.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver posted a statement outlining how the league would approach players or team officials who share their views on such topics:\n\n\"It is inevitable that people around the world -- including from America and China -- will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.\n\n\"However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\"\n\nThe NBA has a pair of preseason games scheduled in China on Thursday and Saturday between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets. ESPN's Rachel Nichols shared video of a banner in Shanghai advertising Thursday's game being removed:\n\nChina's state television broadcaster, CCTV, already confirmed they don't plan to broadcast either of the games. Tencent, the NBA's digital streaming partner in China, also said they would no longer stream the games.\n\nThe Associated Press' Tim Reynolds reported the league canceled a media event Wednesday involving the Lakers and Nets, and it's unclear if the pair of preseason games will proceed as planned.", "description": "President Donald Trump criticized the response of  Golden State Warriors  head coach  Steve Kerr  to a question about the ongoing situation involving the  NBA  and China...", "authors": ["Joseph Zucker"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/832/302/hi-res-0297a07b285222391a694d0be98bb26d_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
