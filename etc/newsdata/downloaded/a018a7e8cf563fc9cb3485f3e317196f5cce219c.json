The black balaclava jumper, which was being sold for n $890 (\u00a3715), covered half of the model's face and had large red lips knitted onto it.\n\nThen in May, the fashion house was accused of cultural appropriation for a $790 headpiece that looked like a Sikh turban. It attracted criticism from the US-based Sikh Coalition, which tweeted: \"The Sikh turban is not just a fashion accessory, but it's also a sacred religious article of faith.\"", "description": "Ayesha Tan-Jones wrote a message on their hands to protest against 'straitjacket' designs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6F37/production/_108917482_gettyimages-1176393593.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
