It takes an absolute lifetime to boot up and occasionally hangs during simple actions like opening the menu. This morning, developer Gearbox pushed out a hot fix that deals with the most pressing issue of all: the incessant screaming of an endgame boss.\n\nWARNING: There are story spoilers from this moment forward.\n\nMy Borderlands 3 adventure is only a few hours long, but my short time with the game has readied me for an eventual showdown with twin antagonists Tyreen and Troy Calypso. Without going into too many details, these siblings kick off the main storyline by being absolute dicks. I can only assume they get worse in future chapters, making any opportunity to fire a few shots in their direction a welcome reprieve from their influencer-based quips.\n\nEnemies can be incredibly talkative in Borderlands 3, especially when they take damage. This dialogue ranges anywhere from basic \u201cOh wow, bullets hurt!\u201d grunts to full-on wailing when they take continuous damage from elements like fire, electricity, and acid. Troy apparently leans towards the latter, so much so that his screams have been a topic of discussion, with players offering both positive and negative opinions on the matter.\n\n\u201cHumanoid bosses screaming from elemental effects is absolutely hilarious,\u201d one Reddit thread says, going on to name Troy and another boss, Aurelia, as two characters with drastic reactions to damage.\n\n\u201cStatus effect screams seriously need deleting on bosses,\u201d another complains. \u201cTake for example the seemingly epic fight with Troy, or Aurelia, or the Zero like fight with Katagawa and the Two Traunt Brothers as they throw insults at you and half way through shit talking you the screams overlap the insults so you don\u2019t get to hear what they are saying half the time.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s hot fix addresses numerous aspects of Borderlands 3, including a reduction in drop rates from certain farmable enemies and nerfs for Torgue shotguns, which became popular due to their ability to output massive damage in the right situations. At the very bottom, the changelog notes that it also \u201cremoved pain sounds from Troy for his boss fight,\u201d making it easier to hear his snide remarks as he flies around the boss arena.\n\nReactions to this particular change have been generally positive, even from folks who didn\u2019t find Troy\u2019s screams to be that big of a deal before the update.\n\nOne player has petitioned the developers to \u201cplease bring back the Troy paingasms,\u201d but the most upvoted response was a simple, \u201cNo,\u201d from another Reddit user.\n\nFor the most part, folks were expecting these changes, though there is some grumbling that performance issues weren\u2019t prioritised over limiting loot farming and some specific sound effects. In any case, Troy now has a chance to talk shit that he didn\u2019t have before.", "description": "Borderlands 3 is fun, but it\u2019s had some problems since launch.
