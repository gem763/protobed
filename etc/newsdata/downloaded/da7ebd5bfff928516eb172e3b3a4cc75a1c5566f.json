Last summer, China hawks like Cotton and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) launched attacks against telecom companies like Huawei and ZTE regarding their allegiance to the Chinese government. In recent weeks, much of this same criticism has pivoted toward TikTok, a video-sharing app that has skyrocketed in popularity with American users.\n\nIn their letter, Schumer and Cotton write that TikTok has received over 110 million downloads in the US alone.\n\n\u201cWe do not have details on the request and will not be offering any further comment on it at this time other than to reaffirm that TikTok is committed to being a trusted and responsible corporate citizen in the US, which includes working with Congress and all relevant regulatory agencies,\u201d a TikTok spokesperson told The Verge.\n\nEarlier this month, Rubio wrote to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asking that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) investigate TikTok for potential national security threats and censorship as well. In September, The Guardian reported that TikTok requires its moderators to censor any content that refers to Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or Falun Gong. The company maintains that these are outdated guidelines, and TikTok moderators receive no input or influence from the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese-owned apps are increasingly being used to censor content and silence open discussion on topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese Government and Community Party,\u201d Rubio said at the time.", "description": "Two senior senators, Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Tom Cotton (R-AR), took aim at the Chinese-owned video app, TikTok, and called for US intelligence officials to investigate it for any threats to national security it may pose.", "authors": ["Makena Kelly", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gGRtqOl8BuJLKbMIib87tuEQrq0=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18331847/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
