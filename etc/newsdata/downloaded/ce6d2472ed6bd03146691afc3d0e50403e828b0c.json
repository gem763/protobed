We view the shares as attractive at current levels and believe the retailer won\u2019t cut its current annual dividend of $1.51, which is yielding 9.3%. As we forecast Macy\u2019s 2019 free cash flow at more than $1 billion, we think its annual dividend cost of less than $500 million is manageable.\n\nMacy\u2019s 0.2% growth in comparable sales on an owned basis in the second quarter came in below our forecast of 0.5%. Moreover, the company relied on significant discounting and promotions to sell slow-moving apparel, including private-label women\u2019s activewear. This pressured the gross margin, which at 38.8% missed our forecast of 39.8% and represented a year-over-year decline of 160 basis points. We think the gross margin was negatively affected by both markdowns and e-commerce fulfillment costs. While Macy\u2019s believes its inventory is in better shape headed into the fall season, it reduced its 2019 midpoint earnings per share outlook by more than 6%, suggesting a lack of momentum and lowered expectations for second-half operating income.", "description": "It's plagued by slow traffic and markdowns, but we think the dividend's safe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/bltf5c9f6de4daaa773/5cb4f480fe8386be234ac8fb/QuarterEndReview_Sectors_Bars_1x1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-16"}
