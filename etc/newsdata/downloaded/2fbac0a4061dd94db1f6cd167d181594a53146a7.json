A dim, dreary sliver of moonlight illuminates an overcast night.\n\nThe planes draw nearer, their monotonous hum piercing the quiet. Laughing and joking a few minutes ago, the young men defending the capital from the forces of warlord Khalifa Haftar now tense up and crowd against the wall of a disused garage that doubles as a forward operating position.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Mortars land nearby, sometimes striking terrifyingly close to the garage. Nearly 80 per cent of the casualties suffered by the men are caused by airstrikes, one commander tells me.\n\nThe planes tend to come out during nights of heavier cloud cover, avoiding clear, starry nights for fear of drawing anti-aircraft fire. At the garage, the young men spot dots of light descending towards the ground, followed by the glow of explosions and earth-shaking thuds. The planes get closer. The thuds get louder.\n\n\u201cThe drones are coming day after day,\u201d says Omry, a 45-year-old father of four.\n\n\u201cThen the planes come, with seven missiles each. We count them, one by one.

Will the next one hit us?\u201d\n\nHaftar, a former army colonel and onetime western intelligence asset, on 4 April declared war on Tripoli\u2019s UN-backed Government of National Accord, an authority supported by many of western Libya\u2019s armed groups as well as its main political parties, including the Libyan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nHe created his Libyan National Army some five years ago, hoping to unite under his rule a nation fractured following the 2011 collapse of Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s four-decade dictatorship.\n\nHe conquered much of the east, including the country\u2019s second city of Benghazi, and the sparsely populated south of the country.\n\nHaftar\u2019s forces are now located just a few hundred metres from the disused garage, past the earthen berm blocking the roadway and along the pockmarked asphalt. They have better weapons and perhaps less to lose than those defending the city.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Maybe more. We are outgunned. We don\u2019t have any strategy. We\u2019re not soldiers.\u201d\n\nBy night, surveillance drones scour the terrain along the front lines separating the armed forces of eastern Libya. Then combat planes, possibly retrofitted agricultural aircraft supplied by Haftar\u2019s patrons in the United Arab Emirates, unleash airstrikes.\n\n\u201cOur air forces are still continuing to strike the holdouts of the terrorist criminals, in support of our ground forces,\u201d Colonel Ahmed al-Mismari, Haftar\u2019s spokesperson, told reporters on 16 May. \u201cThe battle now is very close to the main neighbourhoods of Tripoli.\u201d\n\nThe battle lines fall well within Tripoli\u2019s metropolitan area, a city of 3 million people that is among the most densely populated areas in north Africa.\n\nYoung men fight ferociously, while just a few miles up the road, mothers and fathers with children in tow shop for food, furniture and clothes at well-lit stores.\n\n\u201cEvery day we have 15 to 20 war injuries, mostly at night,\u201d says Najib Birgly, an orthopaedic surgeon at a hospital in Tajoura, east of the capital and near one of the front lines.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re stable. But we lack some things, and every day the supplies get less and less as the injuries get worse and worse.\u201d\n\nThen the planes come, with seven missiles each. We count them, one by one. Where will the next one hit? Will the next one hit us? Anti-Haftar field commander Ayman al-Omry\n\nUniversities and grammar schools have been shuttered. Prices are up. Summer is coming, promising more blackouts and water outages. On 20 May, gunmen allegedly allied with Haftar stormed a key water pump, ordering its engineers to cut off the supply of water to the capital.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no stability, there\u2019s no life,\u201d says Abdul Wahab al-Tarhouni, a 33-year-old employee of an electrical supplies shop in Tripoli, sipping tea with his friends in Algeria Square.\n\n\u201cWe are drifting from day to day. And people have seceded from life, they don\u2019t care about Haftar or anyone else.\u201d\n\nGhassan Salame is a Lebanese scholar who became UN envoy to Libya in 2017. He has struggled for months to bring the country\u2019s factions together to avoid the type of conflict now unfolding.\n\n\u201cLibya is on the verge of descending into a civil war which could lead to the permanent division of the country,\u201d he told the United Nations Security Council on 21 May. \u201cThe damage already done will take years to mend, and that\u2019s only if the war is ended now.\u201d\n\nHaftar, anointed a \u201cfield marshal\u201d by the remnants of one of the broken nation\u2019s two expired parliaments, has been pining for the capital for years. But this attack seemingly came out of nowhere, in that there was no immediate provocation that preceded it or apparent urgent military reason to launch it.\n\nIn fact, a long-planned UN-organised peace conference was to be held in Ghadames just a week and a half after the offensive began.\n\nHaftar\u2019s allies describe the campaign as part of a five-year effort to rid Libya of \u201cterrorist groups\u201d.\n\nSo far about 500 people have been killed, at least a couple dozen of them civilians, according to the UN. And hundreds of people have been injured, putting strain on medical services of a country already broken by more than eight years of near constant armed conflict\n\nSome 75,000 people have been displaced, including African and other migrants desperate to make their way through Libya to Europe. They are holed up at schools or detention centres, the conflict making the west even more alluring.\n\nThe war has also reopened an opportunity for Isis, which was all but vanquished in a gruelling western-backed conflict that drove them out of the central Libyan city of Sirte. Reinvigorated, the group has launched fresh attacks in recent weeks, targeting Haftar\u2019s forces in the south of Libya and menacing the country again.\n\nNow there\u2019s a security vacuum in the south. It\u2019s very fertile ground for Isis International official\n\n\u201cWe spend so much time focusing on the battle between Haftar and the government, we are forgetting the other player on the battlefield,\u201d one international official tells me. \u201cNow there\u2019s a security vacuum in the south. It\u2019s very fertile ground for Isis.\u201d\n\nSeveral well-placed international officials tell The Independent that Haftar had promised his backers in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Russia a quick victory \u2013 that he would be welcomed by cheering Tripolitanians fed up with the armed \u201cmilitias\u201d that make up the city\u2019s security forces.\n\nEven US president Donald Trump, whose government has been steadfastly supporting the UN-backed authority of prime minister Fayez al-Sarraj since it was launched in 2015, cheered him in a bizarre tweet that followed conversations with Haftar\u2019s patrons.\n\nThe field marshal describes the operation as an attempt to take control of the capital and rid it of what he describes as \u201cterrorists\u201d. That reflects the position of the UAE and Egypt, who view any entity that includes the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation.\n\nHaftar went so far as to label Sarraj, the genteel 59-year-old head of the UN-backed Government of National Accord, a \u201cterrorist\u201d.\n\nHe scored some early, easy victories, convincing elders in towns south of the capital to hand over control without a fight, and joining forces with fighters from Tarhouna, a bastion of loyalists to former dictator Gaddafi.\n\nBut what was supposed to be a quick victory has turned into a long, deadly slog with no easy end in sight.\n\nBefore launching his offensive, Haftar gave any armed brigades in the city 24 hours to clear out or surrender. But instead of withdrawing, the armed groups mobilised. Powerful well-armed brigades from the port city of Misurata, battle-hardened during years of fighting against the forces of Gaddafi, Isis, and rival militias, teamed up with armed groups in Tripoli and the mountain town of Zintan to reinforce the city\u2019s defences.\n\n\u201cWe made the most of those 24 hours,\u201d boasts Colonel Faraj Swehli, the leader of a Misurata military unit.\n\nHaftar won control of the city\u2019s disused international airport \u2013 destroyed in a 2014 war between rival militias \u2013 before losing it to the forces loyal to the Government of National Accord, who vacated it under heavy fire. The area remains contested.\n\nAs of mid-May, Haftar also lost some of the key battlefield advantages he had at the very start of the conflict. First came confirmation that the Tripoli government was procuring battle drones and deploying them across the front lines to counter Haftar\u2019s forces.\n\nThen came the stunning photos and video showing at least 21 Turkish mine-resistant armoured personnel carriers arriving in western Libya, a sign that Ankara, under president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was not about to let its allies in Tripoli lose to a force backed by its rivals in Cairo, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. But it remains unlikely that they\u2019ll tip the balance in the GNA\u2019s favour.\n\n\u201cThe newly arrived equipment appears to have produced some immediate success on the ground, because LNA airstrikes have visibly diminished over the last few days,\u201d says Claudia Gazzini, the Libya researcher at the International Crisis Group.\n\n\u201cBut these gains could be short-lived because overall the forces and their equipment appear equal and in the current trajectory both sides of the conflict are likely to turn to their respective allies for more military backing.\u201d\n\n****\n\nThe young man behind the wheel of the little sedan can\u2019t be more than 15 or 16, and the girls sitting in the back seat even younger. Omry orders the vehicle to stop. \u201cThis is military zone!\u201d he tells the young man. \u201cYou can\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nThey explain sheepishly they were just coming back from their home, which lies in the conflict area, where they were trying to get some blankets and supplies and head back towards the city centre, where the displaced are heading.\n\nOmry beseeches them not to return to their home, in a neighbourhood which has turned into a ghost town, with bullet-pocked buildings lining the main highway.\n\nEntire districts of the city have been consumed by the fighting, which for now remains on Tripoli\u2019s suburban outskirts, an area of mostly low-rise buildings and light industry, where young families bought homes because they\u2019re cheaper and more spacious than apartments in the city centre.\n\nSalah Jouma, a 40-year-old manual labourer, was living in one such house. He had been urged to leave when the fighting began on 4 April, but he had nowhere to go. He, his wife, and their five children stayed home and watched the reports of the fighting on television.\n\nOn 19 April a barrage of Grad rockets struck his neighbourhood, one caving in an entire section of his house. Dust and debris were everywhere.\n\n\u201cThe children were screaming. They were hysterical,\u201d he recalls.\n\nIt was a miracle no one was hurt. They left the house on foot, he and his wife walking in the night while carrying and dragging their kids, aged 13, 12, nine, seven and nine months. His wife held their infant. He carried his 7-year-old on his shoulders. They walked more than three miles along a dried-up irrigation canal, until they came to the Wadi Rabaa district, where they tried to find a taxi.\n\nThey wound up like many of the displaced \u2013 in an elementary school, which have been shuttered because of the war. At one school near central Tripoli, children run around the courtyard. The kids, who have grown up over the last eight years amid war and conflict, have grown somewhat used to the chaos, and appear to adjust quicker than the adults.\n\n\u201cThey grew up in a very wrong environment,\u201d says Maysoon al-Diab, a 45-year-old volunteer at one school. \u201cWhen I was growing up the last thing I would ever think of is a Kalashnikov. They see them everywhere all day.\u201d\n\nIf the war drags on or moves deeper into the city, it will continue to take a toll on civilians. Both Haftar and GNA forces claim they are studiously avoiding any civilian casualties. But the UN and international rights groups have repeatedly chastised both sides for disregarding the rules of war.\n\nMohamed Omar, nine, and his 7-year-old brother Obeida were watching television in their house in Tajoura, near the seaside, and their mother, Awatef Muftah, 38, was cleaning up on the morning of 14 May.\n\nIt was already Ramadan, when the kids stay awake to enjoy the cool night-time temperatures. Besides, schools were closed because of the war.\n\nThe missile struck about 1:30am, hitting the outside of the family\u2019s home. It remains unclear what the target was, and the site had been cleaned of bomb debris by the time The Independent arrived.\n\nHossein Attiya, the friendly and outgoing mayor of Tajoura, insists the missile was fired by Haftar\u2019s forces, but an errant GNA missile could have also been the cause.\n\nPieces of shrapnel got lodged in Awatef\u2019s head and neck. A widower, she remained on a ventilator for a week at Tajoura hospital, before she died from her injuries, never regaining consciousness.\n\n\u201cMy mum was sweeping in front of the bathroom,\u201d recalls Mohamed, struggling to get his words out as he recovers in a hospital bed next to his brother.\n\n\u201cAll I heard was the sound of this missile. I covered up my brother to protect him because he is smaller than me. My mum was lying on the floor, not moving. That is all I remember.\u201d\n\nWhen he\u2019s not at the front, Omry buys and sells various items out of a small warehouse. He is often grumpy, but generally good natured and helpful, and tells The Independent about 30 times not to photograph his face \u2013 he wants to travel abroad in the future and doesn\u2019t want to be smeared on social media as a militiamen or terrorist. \u201cJust no pictures,\u201d he says repeatedly.\n\nOmry says he\u2019s exhausted, and hasn\u2019t had a full night\u2019s rest in days. He catches a few hours or minutes of sleep here and there, but that is proving difficult. One brief peaceful interlude \u2013 snatched to allow the young men to temporarily retire from the front line to enjoy a Ramadan breaking of the fast \u2013 is interrupted by a mortar round that falls just outside the disused garage. The men scamper for cover, diving for the ground. Machine gunfire opens up wildly.\n\nFour times Haftar\u2019s men have sought to exploit the air strikes and rocket barrages to breach the front and take their way close to Tripoli\u2019s centre past the checkpoint where Omry spends most of his days. Each time they have been rebuffed.\n\nDespite their show of bravado, many of the young men are evidently terrified of being at the front line. Days after he was interviewed by The Independent, Muftah al-Shalady, the 25-year-old engineering student, was shot, and is still clinging to life at an intensive care unit.\n\nEven if they were able to break through, there\u2019s no guarantee Haftar\u2019s forces would be successful in taking over the capital. The field marshal has his fans in the city, and some are even vocal \u2013 a testament to the freer environment in the country\u2019s west than in its east. But there is no overwhelming outpouring of support.\n\nIronically, Haftar\u2019s putsch may have accomplished exactly what he set out to fight. Over the past six months, goaded by the United Nations, many of the militias that used to dominate Tripoli and frighten residents had been slowly incorporated into the army and police. Gone were the wild-haired young guys in flip-flops driving around in pickup trucks with high-calibre guns.\n\nInstead well-behaved young men drive around in ordinary patrol cars, easing the anxieties of Tripoli residents.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hear the gunfire,\u201d says Abdullah bin Abdullah, a 62-year-old Tripoli resident and oil company manager. \u201cMost of the militias are engaged by the ministry of defence or ministry of interior. Two or three years ago, yes, there were militias.\u201d\n\nNow the militiamen with wild hair in trucks bearing the names of Misurata, Zawiya, and Zintan, the same guys that Haftar was supposedly trying to drive out of the capital, are back in full force, worrying Tripoli residents.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the great bulk of Libyans favour neither the collection of armed groups that have reigned over Tripoli since 2011 or Haftar, who left the eastern city of Benghazi largely in rubble when he pushed out Islamist militias, and has imposed a repressive atmosphere similar to that of his mentor, Egypt\u2019s Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\nSome Libyans hostile to the government in Tripoli note that their relatives in the east living under Haftar describe a worse quality of life than in the west \u2013 a general lack of services and security.\n\nOne Benghazi native, who fled the city after Haftar took over, says that his home in the city was seized by a member of field marshal\u2019s special forces, who had the temerity to call him and ask for his forgiveness.\n\n\u201cThey kill people,\u201d says the Benghazi man, who asked that his name not be used. \u201cThey are jailed and tortured and their bodies dumped on the street,\u201d he says, of dissidents and anti-Haftar Libyans.\n\nHaftar\u2019s supporters are confident they will be able to conquer Tripoli just as they did Benghazi, a three-year battle that Mismari, the field marshal\u2019s spokesperson, on 16 May described \u201cas a great historical epic in which the army and the people put their hands together in their battle against terrorists and criminal groups\u201d.\n\nMismari claimed 17,000 fighters were holed up in Benghazi with heavy weapons, a number that many consider exaggerated. There too, he said, fighters were getting help from inside and outside Libya.\n\nAnd it is true that momentum appears to be on Haftar\u2019s side. Though sometimes gruelling, he has posted a string of wins, even if in the case of Benghazi or Derna, it has meant the destruction of the city. But Haftar may also have overreached. His supply lines remain vulnerable.\n\nOverseas officials say they have been taken aback by Haftar\u2019s charge for the capital, arguing there is evidence that other countries are being at least partly dragged into the war by Haftar himself.\n\nAlgeria, the gendarme of north Africa, has no love lost for Haftar and has grown vocally critical of the offensive, noting with alarm the bombing of a north African capital. Trump has voiced support for Haftar, but he may encounter resistance from US State Department and military officials working on a political solution. The defenders of the capital are determined not to allow Haftar to take the city. As messy as Libya has been, they fear it will be worse if another strongman like Haftar takes over.\n\n\u201cOver my dead body Haftar will win. No way,\u201d says Colonel Hossein Shitat, a Misurata commander helping in the defence of Tripoli. \u201cWe are determined, and we have a cause.\u201d\n\nRead the first part of the The Battle for Tripoli series, Libya: UN-backed government defending capital from warlord Haftar now using drones on front lines", "description": "The ominous hum of the planes in the night sky above interrupts the young men\u2019s light-hearted banter.
