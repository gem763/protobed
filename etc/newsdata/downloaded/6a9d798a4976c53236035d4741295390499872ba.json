(\u201cAgraFlora\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (CSE: AGRA) (Frankfurt: PU31) (OTCPK: AGFAF), a growth oriented and diversified international cannabis company, is pleased to announce the Company has initiated development of Cannessence, a terpene-infused, organic cannabis sativa seed oil consumer packaged good (\u201cCPG\u201d). AgraFlora will position Cannessence within the marketplace as a legal, over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) substitute to conventional CBD.\n\n\n\nCannessence will have a unique formulated terpene profile coupled with organic cannabis sativa seed oil to amplify the activation of the endocannabinoid system (the \u201cECS\u201d); thus optimizing cannabinoid uptake, as well as standardizing pharmacological effects within the ECS of both humans and pets. The Company anticipates that it will market its Cannessence product portfolio in capsule, topical and tincture format.\n\nThe Company also plans to incorporate its proprietary Cannessence formulation as a base serum into its existing Whole Hemp Health (\u201cWHH\u201d) product line. This scalable integration will further augment its vertically integrated \u201cfarm-to-face\u201d mandate while increasing the efficiency of the Company\u2019s existing premium WHH SKUs. An ultra-premium all-natural, skin care line, WHH is formulated with 100 per-cent organic cannabis sativa seed oil and is marketed by way of brick-and-mortar retail outlets, Amazon Prime, as well as direct to consumer, through an integrated Shopify e-commerce platform.\n\nThe initial synthesis of Cannessence will be championed by AgraFlora\u2019s cannabinoid R&D consultancy arm in conjunction with the Universit\u00e9 de Moncton (\u201cUM\u201d) and will be comprised of the following initial deliverables:\n\nCannabinoid extraction and essential oil recovery;\n\nPurification stage for the separation of fats and lipids, or other modifications deemed necessary; and,\n\nA mixing/emulsification stage with the objective of formulating a unique matrix.\n\nAgraFlora plans to pursue secure national listings of its Cannessence product portfolio through prominent, high-traffic distribution channels including: c-store, pharmacies, naturopathic clinics, salons/spas, as well as health and wellness retailers. The Company will also integrate Cannessence in its 17,500 North American points of distribution.\n\nThe Company will leverage its 76-acres riverfront Kent County, New Brunswick cannabis campus (the \u201cCannabis Campus\u201d) and its cannabis research licence from Health Canada under the Cannabis Regulations Act to formulate/synthesize its revolutionary Cannessence product suite. AgraFlora\u2019s Cannabis Campus, formerly a federally owned farm and research facility, boasts over 17,500 square feet of commercial-grade production facilities, as well as 12 separate free-standing structures.\n\nAgraFlora also announces the commencement of a retrofit to seven of the non-core operating buildings at its Cannabis Campus. The retrofit is projected to be completed concurrent to AgraFlora\u2019s 2020 industrial hemp plating initiatives and will include:\n\nStructural restorations;\n\nWater system restoration;\n\nVentilation system maintenance; and\n\nAdditional processing/laboratory/storage area preparation.\n\nBrandon Boddy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AgraFlora stated: \u201cThe formulation of an over-the-counter CBD alternative that boasts measurable efficacy, as well as therapeutic-grade terpene blends will further differentiate AgraFlora within an increasingly competitive dried flower marketplace. By way of our precisely formulated Cannessence terpene profile and complementary omega compounds, we intend to optimize the function of the ECS in human and pets alike through the activation of one of its main receptors- thus magnifying cannabinoid uptake and promoting organic endocannabinoids production.\n\nCannessence has all the hallmarks of a disruptive Cannabis 2.0 SKU that we plan to introduce across Gateway Newstand\u2019s 200 plus locations. Our Cannessence formulation will harness power of terpenes, coupled with all-natural essential oils including limonene, alpha-pinene, beta-caryophyllene, linalool, and beta-myrcene to afford our consumers a safe, non-prescriptive alternative to conventional CBD products.\u201d\n\nAbout AgraFlora Organics International Inc.\n\nAgraFlora Organics International Inc. is a growth oriented and diversified company focused on the international cannabis industry.
