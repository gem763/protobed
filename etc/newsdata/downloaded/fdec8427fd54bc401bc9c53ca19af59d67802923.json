Today begins the next phase of their journey with the launch of \u201cOur Towns,\u201d a reporting project that will see the couple continue their 100,000 mile journalistic feat into the heart of America, underwritten by Grow with Google.\n\nThe Fallowses will document their travels at theatlantic.com/our-towns with weekly reporting dispatches continuing through the end of the year. The first stop is Indiana, with visits to Angola, Muncie, Indianapolis, and Fort Wayne, and throughout the year they will touch down their single-engine prop plane in dozens of other towns and cities. Reporting will appear across all platforms at The Atlantic.\n\n\u201cThe guiding principle of this reporting will be the one we developed\u2014city by city, story by story, surprise by surprise\u2014through our preceding years of travel,\u201d James Fallows writes in a letter to readers introducing the project. \u201cThe central premise is that the most positive and practical developments in this stage of American life are happening at the local and regional level\u2014but that most Americans have barely heard of those developments except in the communities where they themselves live.\u201d", "description": "Cross-country reporting project relaunches today, with support from Grow with Google", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/static/a/theatlantic/img/default-thumbnail.png"}
