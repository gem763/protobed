But I was refused an abortion\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Denise Phelan was denied an abortion three years ago in circumstances so extreme she still finds it harrowing to speak about it, and does so only because she is determined that no other woman should be forced to go through a similar experience.\n\n\u201cMy anger wakes me up at night. It\u2019s a deep, almost in-the-bone anger,\u201d she says. She and her husband, Richard Gosnold, are also still grieving for the loss of their baby, Alenja. Their trauma has been prolonged and they feel it is too late now to try for another pregnancy.\n\nPhelan is one of the many people in Northern Ireland who are fully behind the huge, historic change to the country\u2019s abortion laws that is set to take place in a fortnight\u2019s time. In July MPs voted to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland. The new law, spearheaded by MP Stella Creasy, will come into effect on 21 October unless the Northern Ireland executive takes office again before that date.\n\nThe change has some powerful opponents \u2013 last Monday the four main churches in Northern Ireland jointly called on politicians to get back to Stormont in order to block it. Creasy, meanwhile, has been repeatedly targeted in the past week by anti-abortion activists in her constituency of Walthamstow, east London. Last Thursday things ramped up a notch further when the high court in Belfast ruled that Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion law breached the UK\u2019s human rights commitments. Phelan was not surprised by the intervention by church leaders. \u201cTheir statement just confirms my belief that in this country the Catholic and Protestant churches can\u2019t agree on anything except that they hate women and want to control us,\u201d she says.\n\nHer story begins in November 2015 when, aged 40, she found that she was pregnant. \u201cWe were anxious but so excited,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were thinking, this time next year, there\u2019ll be a little baby,\u201d adds Gosnold. At their 10-week scan they were told their baby had \u201clovely long legs\u201d.\n\nHowever, further tests brought devastating news. There was a fatal genetic disorder, which meant that the foetus would die in the womb or at birth. When one medical professional said to the couple: \u201cYou can go to the mainland,\u201d Phelan knew exactly what she meant. Gosnold, who is English, did not. \u201cIn England you just don\u2019t hear about how things are over here,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, Phelan suffers from extreme and debilitating migraine, which is triggered by stress. She became very ill and could not travel. She has legal training and in desperation set about researching her rights. She found there was a mental health clause that could enable her to have a termination in Northern Ireland. Phelan had, not long before this, survived several years of intense depression. The couple were terrified about the potential longterm impact of the dilemma she was now facing. But no one was willing to refer her for an abortion in Belfast.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The leaders of Ireland\u2019s main churches (left to right) Rev Sam McGuffin, president of the Methodist church in Ireland; Most Rev Eamon Martin, Roman Catholic archbishop of Armagh and primate of all Ireland; Rt Rev Dr William Henry, moderator of the general assembly of the Presbyterian church in Ireland; Most Rev Dr Richard Clarke, Church of Ireland archbishop of Armagh and primate of All Ireland; and Rev Brian Anderson, president of the Irish Council of Churches.

I realised no one was going to help us. It was cruel beyond belief. It was mental torture.\n\n\u201cWe were just set adrift, totally alone. We had no choices. I had to give up. I had to go out and get maternity clothes and people were congratulating me and asking when the baby was due. I was sent to a bereavement midwife at the same time as the baby was still alive and active in my womb. I had to go to antenatal classes.\n\n\u201cWe were also told that if the baby was still alive at birth she would be in pain and have to live her brief life on a morphine drip.\u201d\n\nWhen she was 36 weeks pregnant, Phelan fell as she was out walking. At a scan the next day she said to the doctor, \u201cShe\u2019s gone, isn\u2019t she?\u201d The baby died on a Wednesday. The following Monday, birth was induced.\n\n\u201cI went for five days with a dead baby in my womb. The birth was incredibly fast when it started. I was doped up with anti-depressants and diamorphine but I was also vomiting. I didn\u2019t get an epidural. The pain was indescribable. I thought I was being murdered. It was like being stabbed.\u201d\n\nThe baby was handed to Gosnold. \u201cDenise said, \u2018Richard, what does she look like?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI said, \u2018She\u2019s beautiful.\u2019 I was lying.\u201d The baby had been dead for almost a week. They named her Alenja because it means precious, a torch of life, and because it was rare, and they would not hear it being called. Phelan held her.\n\n\u201cIt was a miracle and a tragedy at the same time,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen his wife was being discharged, staff asked Gosnold to bring his car to the bottom of a fire escape so that she and the dead baby would not distress other women in the hospital ward next to theirs. \u201cI parked, came back in to help Denise, and when we got down to the car we\u2019d got a parking ticket,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI cry every day,\u201d says Phelan. \u201cI had postnatal depression and both of us have had suicidal thoughts. We both suffer from insomnia. I had to leave my job.\u201d Gosnold, who is an artist, was offered medication and put on a waiting list for counselling.\n\nGrainne Teggart at Amnesty International\u2019s Belfast office has given them support and advice, and through solicitor Ciaran Moynagh they have got the backing of the Public Interest Litigation Support Project in pursuing legal redress.\n\n\u201cWe need healthcare based on compassion, human rights, and what is medically best for women and girls,\u201d says Phelan. \u201cAnd we are finally going to get it, no matter what the misogynists say.\u201d\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
