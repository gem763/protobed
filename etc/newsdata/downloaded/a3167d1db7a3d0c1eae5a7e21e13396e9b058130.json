He was not involved in operations or day-to-day,\" the official told Newsweek.\n\n\"All Baghdadi did was say yes or no - no planning.\"\n\nBaghdadi was born in the central Iraqi city of Samarra in 1971 and named Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badr.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n(Image: AL-FURQAN MEDIA/AFP via Getty Im)\n\nIn spite of being a weakly child he enjoyed a successful military career and rose to command al-Qaeda\u2019s Iraqi division which eventually broke away to form ISIS.\n\nIt is believed he was a cleric in a mosque in Samarra the city around the time of the US-led invasion in 2003.\n\nIt is thought he was already a jihadist during the rule of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.\n\nOthers suggest he was radicalised during the time he was held at Camp Bucca, a US facility in southern Iraq where many al-Qaeda commanders were detained.\n\nHe was declared a terrorist by the USA as far back as 2011 but truly came to prominence in 2014 when ISIS had captured vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nHe soon became the known leader of ISIS after he delivered a rare televised sermon from a mosque in the captured Iraqi city of Mosul shortly after.\n\nAppearing unmasked for the first time, he declared himself to be the caliph which is the political and religious leader of the global Muslim community.\n\nHe has been seen in pubic on just one other occasion, in an 18-minute video released in April this year.", "description": "Abdullah Qardash, also known as Hajji Abdullah al-Afari, has reportedly been appointed the new leader of the terrorist cult", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Reuters", "Al-Furqan Media Afp Via Getty Im", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20738503.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_THP_CHPP_271019Slug_2565JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
