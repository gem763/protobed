Identical brothers, 35, have three sets of twins between them", "language": "en", "text": "Anyone who catches a glimpse of the Winstanley family could be forgiven for thinking they are seeing double.\n\nBecause identical brothers John and Dave Winstanley are now the proud fathers of three sets of non-identical twin brothers between them.\n\nIt is believed to be the first time this has happened in the UK. Even their partners bear a close resemblance to each other.\n\nJohn Winstanley (right) is father to twins sets James and Joshua, and Jack and Joel. His brother Dave (left) is father of Seth and Jake. Although John and Dave are identical, experts said this should not influence the likelihood of non-identical twins which run on the female side of the family\n\nThe three sets of twins arrived in under two years \u2013 meaning the newborn baby routine of nappies, bottles and sleepless nights hit the brothers like a whirlwind.\n\nThe pair, from Congleton, Cheshire, were stunned when their partners became pregnant within months of each other.\n\nBusiness analyst John, 35, and his wife Jayne, 35, became parents of James and Joshua in 2016 while Dave and partner Amy Parrish saw Seth and Jake arrive in 2017.\n\nJayne later gave birth to Jack and Joel. She said of her first pregnancy: \u2018My grandfather had a brother and sister who were twins, so we were half-expecting there to be two babies.\n\nJoel and Jack are pictured above. Jayne said: \u2018Jack stopped breathing when he was born, but luckily the doctors were able to resuscitate him and he was able to breathe on his own after 15 minutes. But it was very traumatic'\n\nDave and partner Amy Parrish saw Seth and Jake arrive in 2017. The three sets of twins arrived in under two years \u2013 meaning the newborn baby routine of nappies, bottles and sleepless nights hit the brothers like a whirlwind\n\n\u2018Everyone in the family was saying that it was bound to happen. And when I went for a scan at 12 weeks pregnant, sure enough there were two heartbeats in there.\n\n\u2018I had bad morning sickness for months, but otherwise my pregnancy went really smoothly.\u2019 The twins were born at Macclesfield General Hospital.\n\nJayne said of her second lot of twins: \u2018Three days after I knew I was pregnant I started to feel really sick, so I just knew it was another set of twins again.\n\n\u2018I kept telling John \u2018Don\u2019t expect there to be just one in there.\u2019 And my stomach went really big very quickly.\u2019\n\nThe twins were eventually delivered by Caesarean.\n\nJayne said: \u2018Jack stopped breathing when he was born, but luckily the doctors were able to resuscitate him and he was able to breathe on his own after 15 minutes. But it was very traumatic.\u2019\n\nJohn and Jayne became parents of James and Joshua in 2016. Jayne insisted: \u2018That\u2019s definitely it now \u2013 as I\u2019m sure we would end up with yet another set of twins'\n\nShe added: \u2018It\u2019s lovely that all the twins are so close together. Our twins don\u2019t look alike \u2013 they each look more like the other set of twins, so James and Joel look very similar, as do Jack and Joshua.\u2019\n\nBoth sets of parents say their families are now complete.\n\nJayne insisted: \u2018That\u2019s definitely it now \u2013 as I\u2019m sure we would end up with yet another set of twins. The key to it all is keeping to a strict routine \u2013 otherwise it would just be chaos.\u2019\n\nAlthough John and Dave are identical, experts said this should not influence the likelihood of non-identical twins which run on the female side of the family.\n\nSome women are more likely to produce two eggs in one cycle \u2013 it is unusual that both Jayne and Amy had this.\n\nJane Denton, of the Multiple Birth Foundation, said she was not aware of any other family in the UK in the same situation.\n\nShe added: \u2018This is a very interesting case \u2013 and very unusual.\u2019", "description": "Identical brothers John and Dave Winstanley, from Congleton, Cheshire, are now the proud fathers of three sets of non-identical twin brothers between them.", "authors": ["Lucy Laing For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/21/19964624-0-image-a-8_1571603386822.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
