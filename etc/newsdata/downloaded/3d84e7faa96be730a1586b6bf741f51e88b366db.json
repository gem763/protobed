And the study authors believe that exposure to racism is why.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Differential exposure to racial discrimination may contribute to racial disparities in health outcomes in part by activating threat-related molecular programs that stimulate inflammation and contribute to increased risk of chronic illnesses,\u2019 state the researchers.\n\nThey say that, until now, \u2018racial disparities in health outcomes between African Americans and European Americans have been well-documented, but not fully understood.\u2019\n\nInflammation is an important contributing factor in chronic disease and research suggests that chronic inflammation could play a role in a range of conditions, from cancer to asthma.\n\nChronic inflammation can cause aging and organ damage.\n\nResearchers believe that racism must be a contributing factor because they selected a sample of people to test who had a similar socioeconomic status, and they also took into consideration the health disparities such as social stress, and health care access.\n\nThe researchers point out that previous studies have shown that exposure to racism can impair brain function and impact innate immunity.\n\n\u2018I believe racism and discrimination should be treated as a health risk factor \u2013 just like smoking,\u2019 wrote study co-author April Thames in The Conversation.\n\n\u2018It is toxic to health by damaging the natural defenses our bodies use to fight off infection and disease.\n\n\u2018Interventions tailored toward reducing racism-associated stress may mitigate some of its adverse effects on health.\n\n\u2018As a society we cannot afford to perpetuate health inequities by undermining or disguising the biological impact of racism.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Man invents blood pressure app and cures his own condition after doctors can\u2019t\n\nMORE: Mindfulness can help you get over your biggest fears\n\nMORE: Family adopt a \u2018micro pig\u2019, end up with 28-stone porker taking over their house\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "An American study has found that being exposed to racism may shorten the lives of black people by triggering genes that cause inflammation.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-932074762_1571396907.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
