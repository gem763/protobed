When rubbish trucks come to dump waste here, the security [guards] take valuable items before us and then they sell those things to us.\n\n\u201cThey are not supposed to be doing that. We don\u2019t even understand why they are here in the first place. You find five or six security guards all sitting at the gate and we don\u2019t know exactly what they are guarding.\u201d\n\nShe said they have told Msunduzi Municipality, which is responsible for the landfill, that they did not want KSA security guards at the site.\n\nTumelo, Hloaisi\u2019s younger brother, said the family were still very distraught about the incident.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what really happened. Everyone is telling different versions of the story and the police and the municipality haven\u2019t told us anything,\u201d he said.\n\nTumelo, who is also a waste picker, said their greatest concern as a family at the moment was finding funds to bury his brother.\n\n\u201cI wish the security guard would ... pay for his funeral because we don\u2019t have money to bury him.\u201d\n\nHloaisi, who was described as a \u201cpeople\u2019s person\u201d, is survived by his wife, three children, two younger brothers and his mother.\n\nMsunduzi Municipality spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha said the matter was being investigated by the police.\n\nChampion for the rights of waste pickers, Groundwork\u2019s campaign manager and environmental expert Musa Chamane said the incident was very unfortunate given that they have been telling Msunduzi Municipality that they need to have proper control of the site and build a material recovery facility so that recovery of waste happens in a formal way.\n\n\u201cWe have been telling them [the City], but they never listen,\u201d said Chamane.\n\n\u201cThey were even allocated more than R21 million to build a proper material recovery facility, which would have made life so much easier for the waste pickers but the municipality disregarded all this and that is why such things are happening.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first death at that dump site, maybe it\u2019s the fifth death in a space of about six years. Every year somebody dies either by accident or by infighting between themselves and sometimes with security [guards]. It\u2019s very unfortunate and Msunduzi has failed dismally in managing the site,\u201d he added.\n\nAttempts to contact KSA boss Mohamed Yacoob were unsuccessful on Monday.", "description": "A waste picker was shot dead on Sunday morning at the New England Road landfill, allegedly by a KSA security guard over R50 worth of scrap metal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8830/f3913c948c114f4ab3e6a7da023d7954.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-07"}
