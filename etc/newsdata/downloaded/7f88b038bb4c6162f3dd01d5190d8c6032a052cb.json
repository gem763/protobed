The U.S. also held off on imposing a new round of tariffs.\n\nPi\u00f1era said Chile would not host the Asia-Pacific summit set for Nov. 16-17 and the global climate gathering planned for Dec. 2-13. It wasn't immediately clear if they would be shifted to another country.\n\n'This has been a very difficult decision that causes us great pain,' Pi\u00f1era said in a televised address.\n\nBut he added, 'A president always has to put the needs of his compatriots first.'\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley said the administration looks forward to completing phase one of the deal 'within the same time frame.'\n\nThe South American nation has seen 12 days of massive protests to demand greater economic equality and better public services. The demonstrations have been accompanied by some vandalism and arson, which forced the shutdown of numerous subway stations.\n\nU.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa issued a statement saying that 'alternative hosting options' were being explored.\n\nDemonstrators clash with riot police during protests against the government economic policies, in the surroundings of La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago, on October 29, 2019\n\nAn anti-government protester walks away from the spray of a police water cannon in Santiago, Chile, Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2019. Tuesday is the 12th day of demonstrations that began with youth protests over a subway fare hike that transformed into a leaderless national movement demanding greater equality and better public services in a country long seen as an economic success story\n\n(FILES) This file picture taken on November 9, 2017 shows US President Donald Trump (L) and China's President Xi Jinping leaving a business leaders event at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The U.S. and China have been engaged in an ongoing trade war\n\nThe trade war has been a blow to China's economy\n\nThe Asia-Pacific summit was set for Santiago in November\n\nOne of the main topics for this year's meeting was to be setting up rules governing how countries can work jointly to cut emissions, as opposed to nation-by-nation efforts.\n\nEven if cancelling the Santiago climate conference means those rules don't get written this year, 'the absence of rules does not stop countries from acting either alone or together' to cut emissions, said Nigel Purvis, a climate and environment negotiator in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. 'It really shouldn't slow down climate action.'\n\nChile's President Sebastian Pinera announces that he is calling off the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Forum, APEC, and Climate Change COP25 Conference, at La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago, Chile, Wednesday, Oct. 30, 2019.
