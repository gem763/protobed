There is little sign of the EU accepting the U.K.\u2019s latest proposals on changes to the existing Withdrawal Agreement in time for a new agreement to be finalized at next week\u2019s summit.\n\nJohnson\u2019s finance chief Sajid Javid has already announced large increases in public spending to cushion the economy in the event of a Brexit shock, leaving the government no room for any additional budget shortfalls if it is to stick to a fiscal rule that says public debt must fall as a proportion of GDP next year.\n\nSterling was also hit by a report from the showing a 1.3 drop in retail sales in September, down from a 0.7% increase last year.\n\nBy 3:35 AM ET (0735 GMT), was down 0.1% at $1.2279, having earlier hit a one-month low of $1.2269. Sterling was also down 0.2% against the at 1.1180, having hit a four-week low of 1.1175.\n\nThe , which measures the greenback against a basket of developed-market currencies, was little changed from late Thursday at 98.610.\n\nThe euro itself edged higher in early trade after a modest upside surprise in German , which rose by the most in five month in August. Analysts were, however, quick to say that not too much should be read into the development.\n\n\u201cIndustrial production is always volatile during the summer months, so September will be more important to assess whether we can really talk about a trend reversal,\u201d said ING\u2019s Peter van den Houte. \u201cIn that regard, the omens remain bleak. With yesterday\u2019s data showing that industrial orders actually slowed further in August, there\u2019s little hope of a real turnaround.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the Turkish lira recouped some of Monday\u2019s losses but remains close to a six-week low after the U.S. appeared to soften its tone about pulling troops out of Syria. President Donald Trump had announced U.S. troops would withdraw from areas controlled by anti-Assad Kurdish rebels and would not intervene if Turkey moved against them. His announcement was sharply criticised even by senior Republican senators normally loyal to him. By 3:30 AM, the dollar was at 5.8045 , down 0.5% from late Monday.", "description": "Forex - Pound Falls on Brexit Budget Report; Turkish Lira Recovers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPECA31A8_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
