The subpoena is part of a criminal probe into Trump and his family business. The scope of that probe is not publicly known.\n\nTrump sued Vance\u2019s office in Manhattan federal court to block the subpoena, arguing that as a sitting president, he cannot be subject to criminal investigation.\n\n\u201cWe view the entire subpoena as an inappropriate fishing expedition not made in good faith,\u201d Consovoy, a lawyer for Trump, told the three-judge panel on Wednesday.\n\nCircuit Judge Denny Chin asked Convoy if authorities would be powerless to do anything if Trump shot someone.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d Consovoy replied, adding that immunity would end if Trump were removed from office.\n\nCarey Dunne, a lawyer for prosecutors, urged the judges to reject Trump\u2019s argument.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as presidential immunity for tax returns,\u201d said the attorney Carey Dunne.\n\nDunne assured the court that if Vance\u2019s office obtained the tax returns, they would be kept confidential.\n\n\u201cThis case seems bound for the Supreme Court,\u201d Chief Judge Robert Katzmann said toward the end of the argument.\n\nEarlier this month, a federal appeals court in Washington backed an effort by a House Oversight Committee to obtain Trump\u2019s financial records from Mazars.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit has put U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero\u2019s Oct. 7 order on hold until it considers the case. Vance\u2019s office has agreed not to enforce its subpoena for 10 days if the court rules in its favor, to give Trump time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has weighed in on the case, arguing that Vance must make a \u201cheightened and particularized showing\u201d that he needs the documents for his investigation.\n\nThough the Department stopped short of saying Vance could not get the returns under any circumstances, it said it was \u201cunlikely\u201d he could demonstrate an immediate need for them because the U.S. Constitution bars states from prosecuting a sitting president.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus R.

The 2nd Circuit is currently considering a lawsuit by Trump to block them from getting those records, which do not include his tax returns.\n\nThe House impeachment inquiry focuses on the president\u2019s request in a July phone call for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic former vice president Joe Biden, a key Trump rival and a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.", "description": "A lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump told a federal appeals court Wednesday the president does not have to hand over his tax returns to New York state prosecutors because he is immune from criminal investigation.", "authors": ["Brendan Pierson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444160589&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1AI", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
