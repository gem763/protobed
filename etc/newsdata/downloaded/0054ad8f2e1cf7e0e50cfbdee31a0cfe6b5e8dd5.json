Trump's movie-script flourishes and lavish praise for the crucial member of the Army's elite Delta Force left many in search of more details \u2014 which the Pentagon kept on a tight leash.\n\nU.S. official confirms that the working dog wounded in the Baghdadi raid is ok.\n\n\n\nI said: \"What's the dog's name?\"\n\n\n\nSource said: \"It's classified.\"\n\n\n\nI said: \"Really?\"\n\n\n\nSource said: \"Yes.\"\n\n\n\nI'm still not positive if the source is kidding or not. \u2014 Dan Lamothe (@DanLamothe) October 28, 2019\n\nThe pooch is now back at work with its top secret identity intact: \u201cWe\u2019re not releasing the name of the dog right now. The dog is still in theater,\u201d Joints Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley told reporters at the Pentagon on Monday, adding that the dog was \u201cslightly wounded and fully recovering.\u201d\n\nTrump himself \u2014 notoriously the first president in more than a century with no dog \u2014 continued to drive the warm and fuzzy story (and tout the mission's success) by tweeting out a declassified photo of the dog. The move followed nearly a whole day of the Pentagon wrestling with how much to say about the pooch, according to our colleague Dan Lamothe. The dog could then be identified as a male Belgian Malinois, the same breed who accompanied Navy SEALS on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan.\n\nWe have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi! pic.twitter.com/PDMx9nZWvw \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2019\n\nAnd the president generally known to dislike dogs (just ask his ex-wife Ivana Trump) had a very special invitation: \u201cThe dog who aided the ISIS raid has an invitation to the White House 'whenever he can get over here,' per senior official,\u201d the New York Times's Katie Rogers tweeted. \u201cThe president wants to meet him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dog who aided the ISIS raid has an invitation to the White House 'whenever he can get over here,' per senior official,\u201d the New York Times's Katie Rogers tweeted. \u201cThe president wants to meet him.\u201d \u201cHe has no filter \u2026 But also if he knows something, and he thinks it's going to be good to say or make him appear smarter or stronger, he'll just blurt it out,\u201d one former White House official told NBC News's Courtney Kube and Carol E. Lee of the dog drama.\n\nQUIET PAW-FESSIONAL: While Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper joked that the Pentagon was \u201cprotecting the dog's identity,\u201d it's not really a joke: There's a long history of keeping the names of special forces canines quiet. But the reasons are controversial even within the military dog world, and some reports of the possible name -- Conan -- started to trickle out by end of day.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really get it frankly,\u201d Mike Ritland, who served for 12 years as a Navy SEAL and then as a U.S. Naval Special Warfare canine trainer, told Power Up. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of silly, but that\u2019s their prerogative.\u201d\n\nMike Ritland, who served for 12 years as a Navy SEAL and then as a U.S. Naval Special Warfare canine trainer, told Power Up. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of silly, but that\u2019s their prerogative.\u201d However, other officials and experts said the protocol was necessary to protect the secrecy of the entire unit. Ron Aiello, who takes care of retired special forces canines as president of the U.S. War Dogs Association, explained that the dogs are treated with the same care as their handlers, whose names are also classified.\n\nRon Aiello, who takes care of retired special forces canines as president of the U.S. War Dogs Association, explained that the dogs are treated with the same care as their handlers, whose names are also classified. \u201cThree U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to sensitivity about the raid, said Monday that the dog\u2019s identity was classified because of its affiliation with a classified unit. Releasing the name, they said, ran the risk of identifying the service members to which it was assigned,\u201d per Dan.\n\nReleasing the name, they said, ran the risk of identifying the service members to which it was assigned,\u201d per Dan. Cairo, the name U.S. government gave to identify the Belgian Malinois who captured Americans' hearts in 2011 for being the only four-legged member of the team that killed bin Laden, might not even be real, Aiello told Power Up: \u201cThat may even be a phony name just to keep the dog in the dark and out of public view for security reasons. That was my understanding \u2026 That\u2019s what I was told by a handler in the Delta Force.\u201d\n\nFor those joking about the classified dog name, there\u2019s actually a security reason for it:\n\n-Knowing dog\u2019s name, u can determine the handler\n\n-Knowing the handler, u can determine the unit\n\n-Knowing the unit, tells which Delta unit(s) was part of the raid. \u2014 Mark Hertling (@MarkHertling) October 28, 2019\n\nThe way the U.S. military treats its dogs has come a long way since they were first used in the Vietnam War. \u201cThey are not just equipment like they used to be,\u201d Aiello said, adding that the military used to euthanize dogs after they were too old to serve even if they were expected to live on for several more years. In 2000, President Bill Clinton passed what's known as Robby's Law, which permits handlers to adopt retired military and police dogs when they are no longer fit for service.\n\nThe dogs are now considered the \u201cgreatest assets going into combat,\u201d Aiello told Power Up. \u201cTo me, they are the first line of defense. They are out there leading the troops and providing important information to the troop leaders. They save thousands of lives doing that.\u201d\n\nThat was the sentiment expressed in this case: \"The dog is a war veteran and a valued member of the team,\" a currently serving soldier assigned to Delta Force told the Washington Examiner's Russ Read. \"Within the community, he says, 'The injury to the dog is an injury to one of us. These dogs are a special breed of courageous.'\" (The dogs traditionally hold the rank of noncommissioned officer, per Russ, and outrank their handlers as a way to prevent mistreatment.)\n\nA man and dog perform a fast rope insertion in a military training exercise. (Courtesy of K9 Storm Inc.)\n\nThe process to train and equip these dogs is incredibly expensive. Jim Slater, the president of K-9 Storm which outfits dogs for special forces teams in 30 different countries, told Power Up that every canine receives a custom-fitted vest specific to the dog's body, along with a harness system that enables the dogs to parachute, fast rope out of aircraft, and be lifted into crawl spaces.\n\nThey also receive what Slater called an \u201cintruder camera \u2026 so it has live, encrypted, full night vision\u201d that enables handlers to see what the dog sees \u201cin zero light conditions.\u201d (Slater declined to comment on whether he outfits U.S. dogs because his company's customer list is confidential.)\n\nAnd the training itself is $$$: \u201c These are assets that are worth extreme amounts of money because of the amount of training gone into them \u2014 $50,000 to $100,000 dollars in value,\u201d Slater told us.\n\n\u201c Fun fact: British special forces paratrooper dogs \u201care trained to jump tethered to their handlers from heights as high as 25,000 feet and up to 20 miles away \u2014 or a 30 minute glide \u2014 from a target location,\u201d Wired's Adam Rawnsley reported in 2010. \"The Brits reportedly borrowed the tactic from America's supersecret Delta Force, which first trained dogs to make [such High Altitude High Opening] jumps.\u201d\n\nA very good boy: The admiration that Trump expressed about the dog during his Sunday news conference struck Ritland as an attempt to express \u201cthe level of importance that those who work closely with dogs likely conveyed about that dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur bond and relationship with these dogs is powerful \u2014 and in a lot of cases even stronger than with humans, because you're sometimes spending more time with the dog,\u201d Ritland told us. \u201cSo it\u2019s a really big deal when something happens to the dog.\u201d\n\nBut he did take issue with one thing that Trump said in his announcement of Baghdadi's death: \u201cWe have these military dogs that are heroes \u2014 and he\u2019s talking about [how] this ISIS leader 'died like a dog' -- that's kind of not the right thing to say,\" Aiello told us through chuckles.\n\n\u201cNo, not dying like our dogs. Our dogs don\u2019t die that way. Our dogs are heroes,\" Aiello said. \"So it was kind of a little contradiction.\u201d\n\nThis photo was provided by the White House via the Twitter account of President Trump after it was declassified.

(Alex Brandon/AP)\n\nThe Investigations\n\nTHERE WILL BE A VOTE ON THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY \ud83d\udea8: \"The House will take its first vote on the impeachment inquiry of [Trump] on Thursday, forcing lawmakers to go on record in support or opposition of the investigation and dictating the rules for its next phase,\" our colleagues John Hudson, Karoun Demirjian and Mike DeBonis report.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi's thinking: \"The announcement from Democrats underscored that Pelosi has the votes for the resolution; she rarely embarks on a roll call without knowing the outcome. It also suggests the next phase of the probe \u2014 with high-profile witnesses called to testify in open session \u2014 could push a vote on whether to impeach Trump into December,\" our colleagues write.\n\n\"The announcement from Democrats underscored that Pelosi has the votes for the resolution; she rarely embarks on a roll call without knowing the outcome.

Such a vote is not without political risk: The measure will be \"viewed as a proxy vote for the larger question of impeaching Trump,\" which could be troublesome for Democrats in tight races.\n\nA victory for Republicans and the White House?: Trump and his allies have been claiming that the House's refusal to hold a floor vote made the inquiry illegitimate. White House counsel Pat Cipollone held it up as one of the reasons the West Wing would not allow officials to testify or turn over key documents, even though such a vote is not constitutionally required.\n\nBut it's unclear the vote will change anything: \u201cSpeaker Pelosi is finally admitting what the rest of America already knew \u2014 that Democrats were conducting an unauthorized impeachment proceeding, refusing to give the president due process, and their secret, shady, closed door depositions are completely and irreversibly illegitimate,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi is finally admitting what the rest of America already knew \u2014 that Democrats were conducting an unauthorized impeachment proceeding, refusing to give the president due process, and their secret, shady, closed door depositions are completely and irreversibly illegitimate,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.

And it could be a doozy. Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman of the Army, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, will tell House impeachment investigators that he not only heard Trump appeal to Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, but considered it \"so damaging to American interests that he reported it to a superior,\" the New York Times' Danny Hakim reports.\n\nThe decorated Iraq War veteran \"twice registered internal objections about how Mr. Trump and his inner circle were treating Ukraine, out of what he called a 'sense of duty,' he plans to tell the inquiry,\" per the Times.\n\nKey quote from his opening statement: \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Colonel Vindman said. \u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.\u201d He'll also say that he worried Trump's actions would \u201cundermine U.S. national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Colonel Vindman said. \u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.\u201d He'll also say that he worried Trump's actions would \u201cundermine U.S. national security.\u201d His statements also appear to contradict E.U.
