He pointed out that Germany's average export growth rate was normally around 5.5 percent.\n\nDue to the bleak trade outlook, the DIHK cut its 2019 gross domestic product growth forecast for the German economy to 0.4% from 0.6% previously.\n\nIt forecasts GDP growth of 0.5% for 2020, adding that the increase was mainly due to an unusual high number of working days next year.\n\nIn a further sign of economic trouble, German unemployment rose more than expected in October, separate data showed on Wednesday, suggesting that the manufacturing crisis is spilling over to the labour market and could slow consumer spending.\n\nData from the Federal Labour Office showed the number of people out of work increased by 6,000 to 2.287 million in seasonally adjusted terms. That compared with the Reuters consensus forecast for a rise of 2,000.\n\nThe jobless rate held steady at 5.0% - slightly above the record low of 4.9% reached earlier this year.\n\n\"The recent economic weakness is leaving its marks on the job market. But all in all, it still proves to be robust,\" said Labour Office head Detlef Scheele.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Michael Nienaber; Editing by Thomas Escritt)", "description": "German exports will shrink next year for the first time since the global financial crisis over a decade ago, the DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce said on Wednesday, as Europe's largest economy struggles to eke out growth in a slowing global market.
