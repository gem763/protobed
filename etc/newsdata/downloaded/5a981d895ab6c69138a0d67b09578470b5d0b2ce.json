Hours after Mr. Trump backed out, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would attend, joining German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.\n\n\u201cAmerica and Poland will continue to stand for our common defense,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cAmerica never gave up on the freedom and independence of the Polish people, and we never will.\u201d\n\nThe ceremony offered the nationalist ruling party, Law and Justice, a chance to showcase its close ties to the White House before elections in October.\n\nMr. Pence visited Warsaw the same weekend as Energy Secretary Rick Perry and national-security adviser John Bolton. All spoke of strengthening the American ties with Poland and Europe\u2019s eastern flank against Russia.\n\nThe Americans\u2019 presence reflected the Trump administration\u2019s view of Poland as an ally that is growing closer to Washington in a corner of Europe where U.S. influence is under strain from rival world powers. The U.S. has signed an agreement to add 1,000 troops to the contingent of roughly 4,500 currently kept in rotation in rural Poland. That military presence is meant to deter the Russian military from crossing into Poland or its Baltic neighbors.\n\nOver the next few days, the U.S. hopes to sign an agreement with Poland aimed at protecting the security of the country\u2019s telecommunications systems, a senior U.S. official said before the trip, a move that comes as U.S. officials pressure other allies to cut ties with Chinese telecommunications company Huawei Technologies Co. over national-security concerns.\n\nThe U.S. aims to block a pending Chinese acquisition of a helicopter manufacturer in Ukraine. On Saturday, Mr. Perry said the U.S. is looking to sell gas to Ukraine via Poland to help Kiev reduce energy dependence on Moscow.\n\n\u201cWe expect Russia to be a good citizen, we expect them to respect the sovereignty of Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact is, the United States has been pretty, pretty rough, pretty tough. We\u2019ve hit them right in the nose a time or two to get their attention. And we will continue to do that.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence asserted support for Ukraine during a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday that Messrs. Perry and Bolton also attended. \u201cWe will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine on your security, on territorial integrity, including Ukraine\u2019s rightful claim to Crimea.\u201d\n\nMr Pence didn\u2019t answer a question on the status of Ukraine security-assistance funds, which have been under review by the administration.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Zelensky thanked Mr. Pence, saying \u201cwe really appreciate the United States\u2019 efforts defending the rights of Ukraine,\u201d adding that he has spoken to Mr. Trump over the phone twice.\n\nSupporters of President Trump in Warsaw on Sunday.

Mr. Trump is popular in Poland, and state media for more than a week ran glowing reports of what Mr. Trump\u2019s visit would mean for the country. Signs and T-shirts backing Mr. Trump and the U.S. were spotted in the crowds at the ceremony.\n\nPolish media speculated that Mr. Trump\u2019s visit would pave the way for the U.S. to lift immigration restrictions that require Poles to get a visa to visit the U.S. When Mr. Trump canceled, opposition leaders and government critical media seized on it as a public embarrassment.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Mr. Trump told reporters he would like to come to Poland soon, following up on a 2017 visit.\n\n\u201cI just want to congratulate Poland,\u201d he said when asked if he had a message for the country on the World War II anniversary. \u201cIt\u2019s a great country with great people.\u201d\n\nPoland\u2019s nationalist government has often cited World War II in an appeal to voters, insisting that Germany pay reparations. On Sunday morning, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki repeated that demand.\n\nThe government has revised state museum exhibits and textbooks to elevate stories of Polish wartime heroism. It has sought to squelch what it views as the falsehood that Polish society deserves any blame for the Holocaust.\n\nThe government\u2019s hawkish views on Russia have been reflected in its World War II commemorations: President Vladimir Putin wasn\u2019t invited to Sunday\u2019s event.\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it was the Soviet Union that defeated Nazism and saved European democracy from destruction, in a post on its official page on Russian social-media website Vkontakte.\n\nTen years earlier, Mr. Putin attended the 70th anniversary and was praised for telling a Warsaw audience that the Soviet Union had been immoral in its brief alliance with Nazi Germany.\n\n\u201cNow I think the illusion is gone,\u201d said Slawomir Debski, director of the Polish Institute of International Affairs. \u201cWe are in much different place than we used to be even 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nWrite to Drew Hinshaw at drew.hinshaw@wsj.com and Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com", "description": "Poland commemorated the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II in a solemn ceremony in which Vice President Mike Pence asserted continued U.S. support for what the Trump administration has come to view as a reliable security ally.", "authors": ["Drew Hinshaw", "Catherine Lucey", "Drew.Hinshaw Wsj.Com", "Catherine.Lucey Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103193/social"}
