Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) vowed a speedy return to the campaign trail after leaving the hospital Friday, but it was unclear whether the 78-year-old would be able to replicate his previously frenetic travel schedule. Former vice president Joe Biden, who has spent most of the race as the leader in the polls, has faced daily attacks from Trump over largely unfounded allegations about his son Hunter\u2019s foreign business dealings, highlighting a potential vulnerability for the candidate many saw as the best hope for beating Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is crazier than most. It\u2019s the normal twists and turns \u2014 on steroids,\u201d said former senator Barbara Boxer (Calif.). \u201cAnything can happen. Anything can happen.\u201d\n\nInterviews with more than two dozen Democratic leaders, top strategists and former elected officials revealed that most are still holding out judgment about how \u2014 or how much \u2014 the events will shift the race.\n\nBut they point to several worrying factors, including questions about whether Biden is equipped to mount an effective defense against Trump\u2019s attacks and whether the surging Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) would alienate moderate voters and donors if she were the nominee. Some fear that Sanders\u2019s health problems put a spotlight on the advanced age of the top contenders, all of whom are in their 70s. Others expressed skepticism that any Democrat would be able to compete against Trump\u2019s unmatched ability to shift the public\u2019s focus.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe need to be proposing an alternative, and I think it is going to be very difficult to get any of that through when we are talking about impeachment,\u201d said former senator Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), who lost her reelection in 2018 in the face of high Trump popularity in her state. \u201c \u2018My ideas are better than your ideas\u2019 has now been eclipsed by the news of the day.\u201d\n\nThe shifting dynamic has already altered campaign strategies, as some trailing candidates focus on early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire where they can more easily avoid the nationally broadcast din of impeachment news. But for the front-running trio, the events of the last two weeks have served as a public test of how they would handle crises in a general election.\n\nTrump\u2019s early and fierce focus on Biden \u2014 which includes public requests for foreign leaders to investigate his family \u2014 has challenged the former vice president to prove his ability to fight back.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is not about me, this is not about my son. There\u2019s not a shred of evidence of anything done was wrong,\u201d Biden told reporters Friday. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on the problem. Focus on this man. What he\u2019s doing that no president has ever done. No president.\u201d\n\nBut there are signs that Trump\u2019s attacks are having an impact, even among prospective Biden supporters. One Biden volunteer, Marcie Lammers of Las Vegas, who showed up to his Las Vegas event last week wearing a Biden T-shirt, said the backlash to the impeachment news was clear in the phone calls she has been making for her candidate.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s getting in the way,\u201d she said of the impeachment talk and Trump\u2019s accusations about the Bidens\u2019 actions involving Ukraine. \u201cWhen I do the phone banking, at first people said \u2018Well, I\u2019m thinking about Joe or I\u2019m leaning toward Joe.\u2019 Now, the people that do pick up the phone, they say, \u2018Well if he wants to collect money why doesn\u2019t he just get it from Ukraine?\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe danger for Biden, strategists say, is that voters look past the details of Trump\u2019s charges of corruption against him, many of which have been debunked, and fear the impact. Biden did seek the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had previously investigated a company where his son worked \u2014 but he was carrying out U.S. policy with the support of other Western governments, not intervening on behalf of his family. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing as part of investigation into his Ukrainian employer, which was dormant at the time his father sought the dismissal.\n\n\u201cWhether it is true or not, you have to take it seriously that it is something that might stick, even if there is no there there,\u201d said Glen Caplin, who served as a top presidential campaign adviser for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who ended her campaign in August. \u201cWe saw it in 2016,\u201d he added, referring to charges of corruption that Trump leveled against former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.\n\nAt the same time, several party strategists say Biden still has an opportunity to take advantage of the attention Trump has directed at him. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have announced $10 million in spending on campaign ads that misleadingly attack Biden for his work in Ukraine. Biden has begun airing an ad that directly takes on Trump and accuses him of trying to engineer the selection of the Democratic nominee.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s best positioning is when it is him versus Trump in the primary,\u201d said David Plouffe, a top adviser to Barack Obama\u2019s two presidential campaigns who now hosts the Campaign HQ podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to show people: \u2018Trump is afraid of me. I can stand up to him.\u2019 I would seize that.\u201d\n\nOne factor raising alarm is that Biden raised only $15.2 million over the past three months, putting him in fourth place among the candidates and well behind Sanders and Warren, who have built grass-roots fundraising networks.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be the discussion. He\u2019s the front-runner. Why is he not raising more?\u201d said Terry McAuliffe, a former Virginia governor and a prolific fundraiser who ran the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThis is an opportunity with everything going on. Get yourself on the news and do it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Trump onslaught has revealed growing frustration among some Biden supporters that top party officials \u2014 as well as some of his rivals \u2014 have not done more to rally behind him during what they view as a moment of crisis fomented by Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed in a lot of the leaders in our party who are allowing the GOP to do what they do very well,\u201d said Harold A. Schaitberger, president of the International Association of Firefighters and a fierce Biden backer. \u201cThey have their guns blazing. They have a great coordinated plan. The basic Democratic comment is just crickets. . . . All I know is our side better learn to fight better.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders and strategists also expressed concern that Sanders\u2019s recent illness could raise fresh questions about the septuagenarian polling leaders. Warren, 70, is the youngest, and both Biden, 76, and Sanders, 78, would be the oldest president to ever take office if they won.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSanders started the week on a high note, announcing a massive third-quarter fundraising haul of $25.3 million, larger than every other Democratic candidate. But hours later, he was hospitalized for treatment of a blocked artery. He was released Friday but is taking an unknown amount of time off. It remains unclear whether he will hold events before the next debate on Oct. 15.\n\n\u201cThe age issue was not so much a health-related issue, but rather more one about generational appeal,\u201d said Donna Bojarsky, a California Democratic consultant who has donated money to Democratic Sens. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Cory Booker (N.J.). \u201cNow, because of Senator Sanders, maybe the issue will come up more.\u201d\n\nThe three top-polling candidates have promised to release medical records before the Iowa caucuses, but the Sanders campaign was not fully transparent about his condition. The announcement by his doctors of the heart attack, in a campaign-issued statement, came three days after he arrived at the hospital.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe flurry of impeachment news and distractions for Sanders and Biden have accrued so far to Warren\u2019s benefit, disrupting other Democrats\u2019 efforts to more directly challenge her ideas and background. Warren took the lead in several state and national polls last month, and she is widely seen as building the most accomplished campaign.\n\n\u201cMy sense is the person who is getting the best of this is Elizabeth Warren. She\u2019s not being attacked. And she\u2019s raising money,\u201d said Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans. But any pause in the scrutiny she may face is likely temporary, he added.\n\n\u201cShe has a plan for everything except for how to beat Donald Trump. That needs to get tested,\u201d Landrieu said. \u201cShe says she can do all these things. There\u2019s a thing called political reality. . . . Aspiration is wonderful, but you can\u2019t eat aspiration for lunch and send your kids to college on it. That\u2019s a fundamental decision that Democratic primary voters need to make a decision on.\u201d\n\nThe now-overshadowed attacks focused on whether Warren was the person she claimed to be, and whether her plans, including Medicare-for-all, would alienate general-election voters.\n\nBiden said Warren was not being candid with voters about her policy plans, and his aides had pointed to the vice president\u2019s release of decades of tax returns, highlighting the years when Warren did corporate legal work before entering public office. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has called Warren \u201cextremely evasive\u201d about the details of her health plans. Both Harris\u2019s and Sanders\u2019s campaign staff have pointed out that Warren, who boasts regularly of her grass-roots fundraising model, transferred $10 million into her campaign, including money she had solicited from wealthy donors during her Senate efforts.\n\n\u201cWhat has impressed me about her is she creates her own weather. She has risen in the polls on her own, not pushing off against somebody else,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, a top strategist for Hillary Clinton in 2016. \u201cI hear from a lot of campaigns that she is going to have to answer questions now. Well, I don\u2019t know. She gets asked questions all the time. I\u2019m not sure that confronting her is going to have the impact that other campaigns want.\u201d\n\nAs Warren has steadily marched upward in the polls, the reality that she could become the nominee has unsettled some of the party\u2019s top donors, who worry that she would hand the race to Trump. If it starts to look like Warren will win the party\u2019s nomination, a longtime Democratic bundler said, \u201cthere will be efforts to stop that.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, they think Joe Biden stands between us and Elizabeth/Bernie \u2014 and to defeat in 2020,\u201d said the bundler, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. \u201cSo if he [Biden] doesn\u2019t measure up, that\u2019s where you start to feel angst in the donor community.\u201d\n\nAnother major Democratic donor, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said he and other donors seeking a moderate as a nominee have \u201czero interest in coming around to Elizabeth Warren.\u201d If she\u2019s the nominee, \u201cwe can\u2019t vote for her or Donald Trump\u201d and would sit out the election, he said.\n\nThe donor also expressed worries that if Warren is the nominee, her presence would ruin any Democratic chances to win the Senate, because voters would perceive having a Republican majority as \u201cthe only way to keep her in check\u201d as president.\n\nFor the rest of the Democratic field, which has been struggling in single digits or less in polls, the disruption at the top has provided a shred of hope that they might still be able to break out in one of the early-voting states.\n\n\u201cOne or two people are going to emerge out of that second tier and be viable because I don\u2019t think that the top tier is so strong that they can lock this down,\u201d said Aaron Pickrell, who helped run Obama\u2019s two winning presidential efforts in Republican-leaning Ohio. Asked about the general election, he admitted, \u201cI\u2019m still nervous about all of it.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Party rules are set to narrow access to the November and December debates, possibly excluding candidates such as former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Klobuchar, former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke (Tex.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii).\n\nBut many candidates may continue to campaign without debate access, betting on early-state voters to lift them from obscurity amid the ongoing impeachment turmoil. That is particularly true among those who see themselves as alternatives to Biden.\n\n\u201cThere are some people who think it will fix the field where it is because it will take the oxygen away from the presidential campaign, and I doubt that is true,\u201d said Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.), who polled at zero percent in the most recent Des Moines Register poll in Iowa. \u201cI think the big thing that is shifting is that the voters in these early states really for the first moment are beginning to pay attention to the race. Everything up to now has been preseason.\u201d\n\nRep. Tim Ryan (Ohio), another struggling candidate, said he has newfound interest from donors worried about Biden\u2019s campaign and Warren\u2019s ideology, and at the end of last week was meeting with newly interested donors in Los Angeles. He\u2019s also putting together meetings in New York.\n\n\u201cFor us I think there\u2019s new life into the campaign because of that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been saying how fluid this is,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just wide open, and uncertainty of impeachment adds to it.\u201d\n\nAnnie Linskey, Michelle Ye Hee Lee, Sean Sullivan and Cleve R.
