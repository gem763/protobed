(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nIt\u2019s not just absurd and unfair to the Kurds; it hurts American interests.\n\nTo justify his backstabbing of America\u2019s Kurdish allies in Syria, President Donald Trump cherry-picked a line from a Townhall.com op-ed that supported his stance. The piece, by Kurt Schlichter, an Army veteran and author, was a fairly reasonable argument that while the Kurds may deserve our sympathy, they are not entitled to be protected from Turkey at the cost of American lives. But it will be chiefly remembered for a hyperbolic line in which he sought to remind those criticizing this debacle that the Kurds are not a military power with the status of a longstanding ally. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe Kurds didn\u2019t show up for us at Normandy or Inchon or Khe Sanh or Kandahar.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump, seizing on anything he could find in the face of fierce bipartisan criticism, quickly echoed the line to reporters: \u201cAs somebody wrote in a very, very powerful article today, they didn\u2019t help us in the Second World War. They didn\u2019t help us in Normandy, as an example.\u201d\n\nThe ensuing controversy wasn\u2019t terribly different from those that have followed many other outrageous Trump utterances: The president\u2019s opponents labored to point out his mistakes, while his supporters merely ignored it as just one example of how easily he trolls his critics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times and other outlets published fact-checking articles, all of which agreed that the president, as is often the case, didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. Kurdish forces were not present during the Allied assault on Adolf Hitler\u2019s Fortress Europa for the very good reason that they didn\u2019t have a state or an army and, like numerous other peoples, weren\u2019t given a chance to formally participate in the Second World War, let alone the D-Day invasion. Trump had been unfair to the Kurds, to put it mildly, and his opponents in the press had been given a bit more ammunition with which to hit him.\n\nLost in this familiar cycle of outrageous presidential statement followed by mainstream-media condemnation was the grave substantive foolishness of Trump\u2019s capitulation to Turkey \u2014 and the seriously troubling implications of conditioning American military and logistical support on a country\u2019s actions in World War II.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, the decision itself. Schlichter erred in presuming that Trump\u2019s two choices, when confronted by Turkey\u2019s desire to invade Syria and decimate the Kurds, with whom they\u2019ve warred for decades, were either to back down or yo go to war. America has always had plenty of options short of ordering its soldiers to lay down their lives for Kurdish interests. American warnings had, to this point, deterred Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan from invading northern Syria to attack its Kurdish enemies in contravention of a clear U.S. interest. Allowing the Turks to have their way with the Kurds was not only dishonorable; it was, potentially, a gift to ISIS. Coalition forces in which the Kurds had played a crucial role had largely defeated the Islamic State. Throwing the Kurds under the bus telegraphed to the region that being friends with the Americans is a bad bet.\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s \u201cNormandy Doctrine,\u201d the idea that your country can\u2019t be eligible for U.S. assistance or allyhood unless it was on the roster of forces at Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s disposal 75 years ago, is not only ridiculous but unsustainable. If it held, the number of countries with whom the United States is allied or even on friendly terms would be very small indeed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is, of course, the point of this aspect of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy. Trump ran on a pledge to end U.S. involvement in foreign wars, especially those in the Middle East. He sees alliances as being purely transactional in nature and has, at times, expressed frustration with the commitments to small nations \u2014whether it is the Baltic States that live in fear of Russian aggression or the Kurds \u2014 that come with being the world\u2019s only true superpower, the nation that others depend on to promote stability if not complete peace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem for Trump is not his willingness to listen to his neo-isolationist instincts. Rather it is that his desire to extricate America from the Middle East cuts against three other key goals of his regional policy: defeating ISIS, pressuring Iran and scrapping the nuclear deal it signed with the Obama administration, and maintaining strong support for the state of Israel. He couldn\u2019t beat ISIS and seek to isolate Iran and bolster Israel against its enemies while withdrawing from the Middle East. He chose appearing to do the latter over doing the former, endangering the success of his pressure campaign against Iran and potentially giving ISIS the opening it needs to make a comeback in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictorian statesman Lord Palmerston was an open nationalist like Trump. His rule that nations have only permanent interests rather than permanent alliances is compatible with Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d credo. But if we\u2019re judging whether it is in the interests of the United States to back certain friends over others, then it\u2019s clear that the Kurds are every bit as useful to America today as the Brits and the Canadians, let alone the French, were in Normandy.\n\nSeen in this light, the \u201cNormandy Doctrine\u201d is merely an excuse with which any friend of the United States \u2014 including the Kurds, who have, despite their small numbers and the danger they have faced, proven both faithful and useful to American regional interests \u2014 can be discarded on a whim. Far from an expression of nationalist self-interest, it is a pretext for withdrawal not so much from potential wars but from the policies that will do the most to prevent them. Much like Barack Obama\u2019s ignominious retreats from Syria and Iraq, which Trump has correctly pegged as the primary reasons for the rise of ISIS, the president\u2019s foolish decision to abandon the Kurds may set in motion a chain of events that will drag him or a successor back into war in the Middle East.", "description": "Trump\u2019s \u201cNormandy Doctrine\u201d harms not only the Kurds but also U.S. interests.", "authors": ["Jonathan S.
