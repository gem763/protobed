For telling the story of these Astros, the twisting and turning ALCS and the way baseball is played here at the end of 2019, it was the perfect vehicle.\n\nWhy was Altuve\u2019s pennant-clinching homer so fitting a conclusion? This is why:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2022 It was Altuve, the 5-foot-6 force of nature who defines the Astros better than anybody.\n\n\u201cIt could have been nobody else but him,\u201d Astros pitcher Justin Verlander told reporters in their champagne-soaked clubhouse late Saturday night. \u201cIt was so perfectly fitting.\u201d\n\nAltuve, the 29-year-old second baseman, is the longest-tenured player on the Astros, predating even the regime of General Manager Jeff Luhnow. Signed out of Venezuela at age 16 in 2007 for a mere $15,000 \u2014 after his father begged an Astros scout to give him a tryout despite his diminutive size \u2014 he blossomed into an MVP (2017) and a central character in the Astros\u2019 current, five-year run of success.\n\nAD\n\nHe was there for the 324 losses between 2011 and 2013, as the Astros endured an ugly teardown/rebuild, and he has been there for every step of the climb to the top: the out-of-nowhere playoff appearance in 2015, the World Series title in 2017, the 103 victories in 2018 and the return to the World Series that he ensured with one swing of the bat Saturday night.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been here since the beginning. He\u2019s had a lot of big moments,\u201d Luhnow said in front of the hastily assembled stage where the Astros received the AL championship trophy. \u201cBut to hit a walk-off homer to send your team to the World Series after what happened, where we blew a lead, that\u2019s storybook stuff, and there\u2019s no player I\u2019d script that for better than Altuve. He\u2019s ready for that moment. He was ready for that pitch, facing one of the best closers in baseball. That\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be reading about for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u2022 It was at Minute Maid Park.\n\nAD\n\nThe Astros are so good at home \u2014 a major league-leading 60-21 this season, 15-5 over the past three postseasons \u2014 that when they lose a game there, as they did in Game 1 of the ALCS, it carries an element of shock.\n\nOn Saturday night, even after the Astros blew a two-run lead in the ninth \u2014 on DJ LeMahieu\u2019s game-tying homer off Houston closer Roberto Osuna \u2014 there was a sense of inevitability, particularly as the top of the Astros\u2019 lineup came around against Chapman in the ninth, with George Springer drawing a two-out walk ahead of Altuve\u2019s turn.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going out to left,\u201d ace Gerrit Cole, as later recounted to Fox Sports, predicted on the Houston bench when Altuve came to the plate in the ninth. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going deep.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFor the 107-win Astros to hold off the 103-win Yankees in September to claim home-field advantage throughout the playoffs was no small matter. They rode their top players and their best pitchers late in the season to achieve it \u2014 precisely so they could play the most important postseason games, such as Game 5 of the AL Division Series against the Tampa Bay Rays (a win), Game 6 of the ALCS on Saturday night (another win) and Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday night, in their own building.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the best places to play,\u201d Manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cTo reward [the fans] with that experience of the walk-off homer, give them a chance to just go crazy at close to midnight and know that we\u2019ve got more baseball to be played. We still have home field for the World Series. It\u2019s why we worked our tail off to get as many wins as we could. It is for them. We want to hang another flag for them, and we\u2019re four wins away.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u2022 It was a homer.\n\nAD\n\nAs everyone knows by now, this was the Year of the Home Run in baseball, with a record 6,776 of them hit this year, 11 percent more than any previous season in history. And as everyone predicted, this postseason was going to come down to homers \u2014 the team that hit the most was going to prevail.\n\nBut guess what? It hasn\u2019t exactly happened that way. The ALCS was the eighth series of this postseason, including the wild-card games, and the team that hit the most homers is just 4-4 in those series. That includes this ALCS, in which the Yankees out-homered the Astros, 10-8. (The Rays out-homered the Astros in the division series as well, 7-6.)\n\nBut what matters more than the sheer number of homers is the magnitude and the circumstances \u2014 having runners on base when the homers come and hitting them late in games and in the highest-leverage situations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYuli Gurriel\u2019s three-run homer in Saturday night\u2019s first inning, off Yankees \u201copener\u201d Chad Green, was a perfect example. It was the seventh three-run homer in this postseason overall, with three of them coming by the Astros against the Yankees in this series. Two of those, one each from Springer and Carlos Correa, came in their pivotal Game 4 win at Yankee Stadium.\n\nLikewise, there have been 11 homers hit this postseason in situations designated as \u201chigh leverage,\u201d according to baseball-reference.com, and five of those have been hit by the Astros, two by Altuve.\n\n\u2022 It was off Chapman, and on a slider.\n\nIf anything, this series demonstrated the acute limitations \u2014 dare we say the folly? \u2014 of trying to do what the Yankees did this postseason, essentially attempting to ride an elite bullpen to sustained success over the course of what could wind up being a four-week enterprise. In stark contrast to the Astros\u2019 starter-reliant approach, they consistently pulled their starters in the middle of games and leaned on five key relievers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt almost worked. But it had an inherent flaw.\n\nOne of the reasons relievers have become so successful in modern baseball is the element of novelty \u2014 when a batter sees a top reliever only once per game, and perhaps a few times in a season, it is tougher than facing an elite starter for a third time in a game or a 10th or 12th time in a season.\n\nBut when Green faced Gurriel in the first inning Saturday night, for example, it was the fourth time they had met in this series, the first three of which resulted in outs.\n\nThe Astros also knew Chapman well, having beaten him in Game 2 of the 2017 ALCS \u2014 with Altuve starting the winning rally with a one-out single \u2014 and having already seen him twice in this series, including Game 2, when they extended him to 25 pitches.\n\nAD\n\nOn Saturday night, the Yankees could have chosen to walk or pitch around Altuve and face light-hitting defensive sub Jake Marisnick instead. But they pitched to Altuve, with Chapman throwing a lazy, 2-1 slider that he pounded high off the stadium facade in left.\n\nAD\n\nIt was poor execution on the part of Chapman but also poor decision-making. Among other reasons was this: Although this may be the era of slider dominance \u2014 with that pitch rising in usage across the majors in each of the last five seasons, to a high of 18.3 percent of all pitches in 2019 \u2014 the Astros are the best at neutralizing it, slugging .492 against sliders, more than 50 points better than any other team in the majors.\n\nThe Astros are now closing in on dynastic status \u2014 or at least as close as any team has come since the 1996-2000 Yankees. They are four wins against the Nationals away from becoming the first team since the 1942-44 St. Louis Cardinals to win 100-plus games in three straight seasons, with at least two World Series titles in the same span.\n\n\u201cOur goal was to win multiple championships,\u201d Luhnow said late Saturday night. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet. We won one. Now we\u2019re going to another [World Series], and hopefully we\u2019ll get that done.\u201d\n\nRead more:", "description": "For telling the story of these Astros, the twisting and turning ALCS and the way baseball is played here at the end of 2019, Jos\u00e9 Altuve's walk-off was the perfect vehicle.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/F3aW9fIrzZNCMMVMuUdnVo8jnCE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P5JJ47XS7MI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
