Add Vaping as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Vaping news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe study details high levels of a chemical called pulegone, which in other studies has been found to cause cancerous changes in the livers and lungs of mice that ingested it. Pulegone is a constituent of oil extracts prepared from mint products and it\u2019s been found in mint and menthol-flavored e-cigarette products.\n\nThe researchers used previously published Centers for Disease Control data of the concentrations of pulegone in select e-cigarette liquids -- and also in smokeless tobacco -- and combined these with the ingestion exposure data from animal studies to calculate a \u201cmargin of exposure,\u201d a level used by regulatory agencies including the FDA to assess human health risks. Theoretically, the larger the safety margin, the safer the product.\n\n\u201cWe found that for all mint and menthol liquids that we analyzed, the range was 300-6,000, where levels should be at least above 10,000,\u201d Dr. Sairam Jabba, Senior Research Associate at Duke University and co-author of the study, told ABC News.\n\nThe data was originally collected in 2015 at a time when many vaping devices involved larger volume tank systems, refilled by users with separately purchased oil, rather than the more ubiquitous smaller volume pods we see today. Brands evaluated by the study included V2 -- a company later purchased by JUUL -- as well as Premium, South Beach Smoke and Skoal mint snuff.\n\n\u201cNow in 2019, there is still a large number of tank users, often the most regular and intense users of vaping products and likely at the highest risk of developing adverse reactions,\u201d explains Dr. Sven-Eric Jordt, study co-author.\n\nBecause of its potential cancer-causing properties, the FDA banned pulegone as a food additive last year in response to petitions from consumer groups. The tobacco industry has been aware of pulegone\u2019s cancer-causing potential and has made efforts to reduce levels in menthol cigarettes.\n\nHowever, in the studied mint and menthol e-cigarette liquids, the estimated pulegone exposure is significantly higher than exposure from cigarettes, according to the study\u2019s authors.\n\nAs of now, the FDA has not regulated the chemical\u2019s presence in e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, which have been promoted as safer alternatives to regular cigarettes.\n\n\u201cCurrent regulations on e-cigarettes are inadequate,\u201d Jabba said. \u201cThe FDA needs to implement new regulations to exclude harmful chemicals like pulegone to reduce the associated health effects.\u201d All companies were contacted for comment about pulegone concentrations in their products and only Premium responded.\n\n\u201cOral absorption and ingesting are not interchangeable for this method,\u201d Vitali Servutas, the CEO of Premium, told ABC News, taking issue with the methodology that the study used to translate harms from swallowing into harms from inhaling the chemical. But extrapolating data from oral toxicity studies to inhalation exposure is a common practice among regulatory agencies, according to the study\u2019s authors.\n\nJohn Keeble/Getty Images, FILE\n\n\u201cWith pulegone known to be a potential human carcinogen, and in the background of youth epidemic and the recent hospitalizations of e-cigarette users, relying on the absence of respiratory data is irresponsible,\u201d said Jabba.\n\nEarlier this year, researchers from the University of California at Riverside published an extensive chemical analysis of JUUL liquids, which found detectable levels of pulegone in \u201cCool Mint\u201d and \u201cClassic Menthol\u201d flavors.\n\n\u201cPulegone is only present in JUUL e-liquids in very small quantities, as a naturally occurring constituent of mint flavoring,\u201d said JUUL spokesperson Lindsay Andrews. \u201cBased on the calculation in the study, in order to reach an exposure level above the threshold of carcinogenic concern for pulegone, a person would have to consume hundreds of pods per day.\u201d\n\nHowever, the specific concentrations of pulegone in JUUL products have not been published, and therefore the study\u2019s authors could not calculate the potential harm independently.\n\n\u201cIt is possible JUUL\u2019s products have only small amounts of pulegone, alleviating concerns, or perhaps more,\u201d Jordt said, but we cannot know in the absence of absolute concentrations of pulegone in the e-cigarette liquids. \u201cIt is fairly simple for flavor chemists to redesign flavor mixes omitting pulegone, using synthetic mint oils, so it is hard to understand why the industry is so sensitive about it,\u201d Jordt told ABC News.\n\nRobert F. Bukaty/AP, File\n\nIf mint and menthol are banned in these products, there are other menthol derivatives with cooling effects that may be used as substitutes, Jabba said, adding that these alternate additives haven\u2019t been studied.\n\nAccording to the FDA\u2019s most recent announcement, all flavored e-cigarettes other than tobacco flavor are potentially on the chopping block.\n\nBut in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s ban on flavored e-cigarettes enacted on Tuesday does not apply to menthol flavors. While mint flavors have been included in the ban, as they are considered sweeter and more appealing to youth, stores will still be able to sell menthol flavors.\n\n\u201cThe menthol flavor for the vaping helps menthol cigarette smokers,\u201d explained the Governor. He highlighted the \u201cvery limited pool\u201d of smokers for whom all other cessation methods have failed.\n\nBut mint and menthol flavor usage, grouped together, has surged in popularity among high schoolers from 51% to 64% from 2018 to 2019. These were the only flavors that increased in popularity over the year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still looking at menthol and very well may end up including it in the ban. It\u2019s not totally in the clear just yet,\u201d a spokesperson for the Governor\u2019s office told ABC News.\n\nLauren Kelly, MD, MPH, is an Internal Medicine resident physician in New York City working with the ABC News Medical Unit.", "description": "The study details high levels of a chemical called pulegone, which in other studies has been found to cause cancerous changes in the livers and lungs of mice that ingeste", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/man-vaping-mo_hpMain_20190905-201843_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
