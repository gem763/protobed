That's triple that of the World Health Organization's 40 mcg limit, according to research last month\n\nExperts have long warned air pollution poses a risk to health, but the new research contains some of the starkest findings yet of the extent of that harm.\n\nScientists say the microscopic particles emitted by cars and industry are breathed deep into the lungs and enter the blood stream.\n\nFrom there it can trigger heart disease and lung cancer later in life, as well as lung infections such as pneumonia.\n\nThe observational study did not offer a reason as to why the children were more likely to die early.\n\nResearchers at the Cardiff University School of Medicine found three separate air pollutants all independently raised the risk of babies dying.\n\nThe main culprits were nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sooty smog pumped out by old diesel cars - known as particulate matter (PM10) - and sulphur dioxide (SO2).\n\nNO2 and PM10 are mainly released from traffic, whereas SO2 is produced from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas.\n\nThe research team used the UK's Office for National Statistics to analyse data from 7,984,366 live births and deaths in England and Wales over the 12 years.\n\nThey divided the country into approximately 35,000 small areas, each with a similar population size of 1,500 residents or 650 households.\n\nResearchers then used average annual pollution data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\n\nThe team, led by Dr Sarah Kotecha, calculated how much pollution each area was exposed to before linking it to death rates.\n\nPOLLUTION LEVELS ILLEGAL IN MOST UK MONITORING ZONES The UK\u2019s air pollution was labelled a 'national embarrassment' in September. Figures for 2017 showed 37 out of 43 air quality zones across the UK had illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution, the same number as the previous year. Annual average levels of the pollutant from exhaust fumes fell in most places, figures from the Government and environmental law charity ClientEarth revealed. But levels are still more than double the legal limit in Greater London and also well over the limit in areas including South Wales, West Midlands, Glasgow and Greater Manchester. Brighton, Worthing and Littlehampton in West Sussex \u2013 an area declared as legal in the previous year \u2013 crept up to just below the threshold again, the statistics show. The UK has been breaching EU pollution limits for nitrogen dioxide, much of which comes from diesel vehicles, since the rules came into effect in 2010. Air pollution causes an estimated 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK and is linked to health problems from childhood illnesses to heart disease and even dementia.\n\nThere was a 20 to 40 per cent increased risk of death for babies aged up to one in the most polluted areas.\n\nThe doctors also found a 20 to 40 per cent increased risk of neonatal deaths \u2013 deaths that occur within 28 days of birth \u2013 in polluted areas.\n\nAnd they recorded a 30 to 50 per cent spike in post-neonatal deaths, which occur between 28 days after birth and one year, in the same areas.\n\nAfter adjusting for factors that could affect the results, such as deprivation, birthweight, maternal age and multiple births, the risks decreased slightly.\n\nThe chance of an infant dying was seven per cent greater in areas with high levels of NO2, four per cent for PM10 and 19 per cent for SO2.\n\nThey found that neonatal deaths increased by 21 per cent in areas plagued by SO2, but not significantly for NO2 and PM10.\n\nAnd the risk of post-neonatal deaths increased by 11 per cent, 12 per cent and 15 per cent for areas high in NO2, PM10 and SO2, respectively.\n\nThe average level of the pollutants in the mot polluted areas were was 34ug/m3 for NO2, 22ug/m3 for PM10 and 6ug/m3 for SO2.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) says a safe level of NO2 is below 40ug/m3, 20ug/m3 for PM10 and under 5ug/m3 of SO2.\n\nDr Kotecha said: 'We found NO2, PM10 and SO2 are each linked in varying degrees to infant deaths from any cause, and to neonatal and post-neonatal deaths.\n\n'This is an important finding as the pollutants are produced and derived from different sources.\n\n'Our findings show that although progress has been made, the challenge remains to reduce air pollution in order to reduce the numbers of infant deaths.\n\n'In the meantime, by understanding how pollution affects babies, either directly or via the mother, we may be able to target appropriate therapies or other interventions, depending on the amount of exposure to the different types of pollutants.'\n\nThe findings are to be presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress on Sunday in Madrid.\n\nCurrently 36,000 Britons a year die to air pollution, costing the country \u00a320billion annually in healthcare.\n\nA further 29,000 people die with a range of illnesses linked to air pollution such as cancer, diabetes and chronic lung disease.\n\nThe UK is notoriously bad at controlling air pollution, with 37 cities persistently displaying illegal levels and the Government repeatedly being hauled into court over the past few years.\n\nDiesel cars have been promoted since the 1970s as an environmentally-friendly choice because they emit less carbon dioxide.\n\nBut in recent years scientists have realised that diesel also produces more of the tiny particles and nitrogen oxides that are damaging to our health.\n\nAIR POLLUTION REDUCES LUNG FUNCTION IN YOUNG CHILDREN, STUDY FINDS Air pollution reduces the lung function of children, research has also suggested. In the largest study of its kind, University of Leicester experts calculated the PM10 exposure of nearly 14,000 children between 1990 and 2008. The team, who will present their findings at the same conference, looked at how it affected each trimester of pregnancy, as well as during infancy and childhood. Results showed children who had been exposed to high levels of PM10 \u2013 from road traffic \u2013 had reduced lung function by the age of eight. Professor Anna Hansell, study co-author, said: 'We found exposure to road traffic PM10 in very early life showed harmful associations with lung function in eight-year-olds. 'Associations were stronger among boys, children whose mother had a lower education level or smoked during pregnancy. 'Our findings suggest air pollution in pregnancy and early life has important impacts on lung function in early childhood.\u2019 She added: \u2018[The reduced function] may affect children's development and potentially also their long-term health trajectory.' However, the researchers did not see similar links between traffic pollution and lung function in children at the age of 15 years. It is believed this is because of a crackdown on pollution over the study peiod. Professor Hansell said: 'We think this may be because air pollution levels, particularly diesel emissions, were reducing over the time that the lung function was increasing in these analyses. 'However, it is also possible that the effect of air pollution is small and that lung growth is able to outpace the adverse effects by teenage years.' She said it was unclear how traffic pollution could affect childhood lung function, particularly during pregnancy. One mechanism could be that particles cross the placenta and disturb the development of the growing foetus's lungs. Jorgen Vestbo, professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Manchester, said the findings highlight the dangers of being exposed to filthy air from the start of life. Professor Vestbo, who is also chair of the European Respiratory Society's Advocacy Council, added: 'Lots of previous research has shown that in the long term, outdoor air pollution can reduce life expectancy, affect lung development, increase asthma incidence and lead to other chronic respiratory diseases. 'Breathing is the most basic human function required to sustain life. We cannot give up the fight for the right to breathe clean air, and we must continue to apply pressure on policymakers to ensure that maximum pollutant levels indicated by the World Health Organization are not breached across our cities and towns in order to protect the health of young babies, as well as the wider population.' Researchers looked at the youngsters during pregnancy and at the ages of zero to six months, seven to 12 months and then annually to the age of 15 years. They measured the volume of air that children could force out in one second and the maximum amount of air they could exhale after taking the deepest possible breath. Children took the tests at the age of eight and 15 years and scientists compared their results to their exposure to PM10. Every one microgram per cubic metre of air (mcg/m3) of PM10 during the first trimester of pregnancy was linked to a 0.8 per cent reduction in lung function. The researchers found a similar trend during the second and third trimesters, over the whole pregnancy, and up to the age of eight.", "description": "Researchers looked at\u00a08million births in England and Wales between 2001 and 2012 and found those in the most polluted areas were  30 to 50 per cent more likely to die by one.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/15/17478828-0-Thousands_of_lives_would_be_spared_every_year_if_the_government_-a-13_1569506617044.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
