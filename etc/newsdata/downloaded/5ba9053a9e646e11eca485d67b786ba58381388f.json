Photo: ABC\n\nAfter weeks of whispers about Joe Biden\u2019s mental state and a constant cataloging of his gaffes by the political press, one of his opponents in the Democratic nominating contest finally broached the issue, if somewhat obliquely, to the former vice president\u2019s face at Thursday night\u2019s debate in Houston.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s was the one to do it. The former HUD secretary, who served in the Obama administration with Biden, attempted to draw a distinction between his health care plan and Biden\u2019s, saying, \u201cThe difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in. And I would not require them to opt in. They would automatically be enrolled. That\u2019s a big difference.\u201d\n\nBiden responded, saying, \u201cThey do not have to buy in.\u201d That\u2019s when Castro pounced.\n\n\u201cYou just said that two minutes ago. You just said two minutes that they would have to buy in.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro asked, repeating the line several times with slight variations.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro to Joe Biden: \"Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you're saying they don't have to buy in...I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you're not.\" pic.twitter.com/AgJ8dpvvMj \u2014 Axios (@axios) September 13, 2019\n\nThe implication was clear, but Castro was wrong. Two minutes prior, Biden said that under his health care plan, \u201cevery single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan.\u201d\n\nAnd about 10 minutes prior to that, Biden said it more plainly: \u201cAnyone who can\u2019t afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have.\u201d", "description": "Juli\u00e1n Castro went after Joe Biden during the third Democratic debate in Houston, saying repeatedly, \u201cAre you forgetting what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d But it turns out Castro was wrong about Biden\u2019s health care plan.", "authors": ["Adam K.
