From October 21, Australians have been able to order plant-based Hawaiian, ham and cheese, supreme and pepperoni pizzas.\n\nHungry Jack\u2019s\n\nAfter rolling out vegetarian and vegan burgers, Hungry Jack\u2019s revealed its plant-based burger, the Rebel Whopper, this month. The Rebel Whopper is targeted at flexitarians - those who eat meat but want to eat less of it. The patty was developed together with plant-based meat company v2food, which is backed by the CSIRO, and Competitive Foods Australia, the group behind Hungry Jack\u2019s.\n\nLord of the Fries\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverything on the Lord of the Fries menu is vegan. \u201cWe don\u2019t have vegan options because we are the vegan option\u201d, as the company says on its website.\n\nLaunching in 2004, the company is not only vegan, but Kosher and Halal as well. Its burgers and hot dogs are made using the Beyond Burger and Beyond Sausage.\n\nMad Mex\n\nAmong its variety of Mexican dishes including nachos, tacos, and burritos is Mad Mex\u2019s Poco Diablo spicy vegan chicken burritos. The burrito uses vegan chicken, which is made from ingredients including soy protein, sunflower oil and spices and salt.\n\nRibs & Burgers\n\nIn March, Ribs & Burgers rolled out two plant-based burgers, Beyond Old School Cheese and Beyond Original. These use, you guessed it, patties from Beyond Meat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe collaboration with Beyond Meat is a brilliant example of food and flavour innovation \u2013 it has replicated the taste and texture of meat, but is 100 per cent plant based,\u201d Ribs & Burgers food manager Etienne Lubbe said at the time.\n\nGrill\u2019d\n\nLikwise, Grill\u2019d uses Beyond Meat burgers for its meat alternative burger range. Plus, for an extra $3 you can make any burger meat-free by swapping the meat patty for a Beyond patty.\n\nSoul Burger\n\nSoul Burger offers plant-based burgers, with a belief that \u201cplants are the future of meat\u201d. Its menu is filled with plant-based beef and chicken burgers, not to mention its \u201cpulled pork\u201d burger which is made from BBQ pulled jackfruit.\n\nThis story first appeared in Business Insider.
