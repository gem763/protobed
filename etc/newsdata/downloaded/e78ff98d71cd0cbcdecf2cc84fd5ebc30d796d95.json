It\u2019s this filling that made this jacket one of the lightest and most comfortable that we tested, we never felt weighed down or encumbered while walking in it. The all round utility of the jacket is added to by the fact that it packs down easily into its own side pocket and can be stored away in your rucksack. Detailing was excellent too, from the quality zips to the chin/beard guard that stops skin getting snagged when the jacket is zipped up to the neck.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe North Face apex flex Gore-Tex jacket: \u00a3250, The North Face\n\nIf you know that you\u2019re in for some seriously wet and windy conditions but still need to get out into the elements then this is the jacket you should be reaching for. Even walking through horizontal rain for hours it remained absolutely watertight with a hydrophobic surface that had no problem repelling a prolonged downpour. It\u2019s pretty unique in that it has all the functionality of a hardshell jacket, but with the comfort and wearability of a softshell with a nice slim, profiled fit.\n\nBuy now\n\nAdidas terrex windweave insulated hooded jacket: \u00a3169.95, Adidas\n\nThis is a water repellent jacket with an excellent weight to warmth ratio, which makes it great for winter. The synthetic insulation kept us warm, but allowed for good temperature regulation when we were working harder on more technical trail sections. The ripstop fabric stood up well on overgrown parts of our walk so we weren\u2019t constantly feeling it snag on branches and brambles. The balaclava-style hood was very welcome for wind-whipped areas of high ground and it packed down easily down into one of its own pockets for easy storage in a backpack.\n\nBuy now\n\nArc\u2019teryx norvan SL hoody: \u00a3255, Arc\u2019teryx\n\nThis good looking waterproof shell has a stretchy athletic fit, which moved well with our upper body as we walked at a quicker pace and needed the jacket to work with our momentum. It\u2019s lightweight and very breathable so we were never close to overheating. When the sun came out and we wanted to lose a layer it packed down to the size of a fist so took up minimal space. The hood fitted nicely and the elasticized rim meant that it stayed in place even when we were walking directly into the wind.\n\nBuy now\n\nBarbour fohn waxed cotton jacket: \u00a3269, Barbour\n\nThe wax treatment makes this hip-level, high collar jacket more than able to stand up to heavy rain and provide a barrier to cutting northerly winds. The raglan design where the sleeves meet the tunic make it very comfortable and it\u2019s perfect if you have a walk in mind that doesn\u2019t require rucksacks and rations. There\u2019s excellent detailing here \u2013 from the roomy bellows pockets to the storm cuffs and detachable fleece-lined hood \u2013 and as with all waxed jackets you can guarantee that it\u2019s going to weather really well with age.\n\nBuy now\n\nParamo torres activo: \u00a3185, Paramo Clothing\n\nThis is a jacket designed with plenty of movement in mind, so if your walks often turn dynamic because of the terrain then this athletic fit, synthetic filled jacket is a good choice. The jacket insulated really well in some biting moorland winds and on a coastal path. It has good detailing with two zipped hand warming pockets that make a great alternative to gloves. There\u2019s even an OS map-sized pocket on the inside so you can stay on course. This also packs away easily into the chest pocket for portability.\n\nBuy now\n\nAdidas my shelter rain jacket: \u00a3169.95, Adidas\n\nIf you\u2019re walking through the urban jungle this offering from the sportswear brand has style, substance and some pretty unique features. It\u2019s fully waterproof with a hidden hood, high neckline and sealed seams, although it\u2019s still nicely breathable thanks to a three-layer membrane. The fit is borderline baggy so there\u2019s plenty of room for movement and the jacket also offers a unique feature whereby two straps go over your shoulders so that you can drape the jacket off your body without fully removing it.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe North Face Thermoball eco packable jacket: \u00a3170, The North Face\n\nLessen your environmental footprint when you\u2019re on the footpaths with this lightweight softshell that\u2019s made from recycled polyester fabric and insulation. It kept us warm without overheating and is a nice slim fit so we never felt restricted, whether rambling over the flat or pumping hard uphill. The jacket will pack down into the pocket for easy storage and is available in seven different colour schemes.\n\nBuy now\n\nTarget Dry benone: \u00a359.95, Target Dry\n\nMid length with a concealed hood, this is an excellent choice for walks to the country pub for Sunday lunch, as it offers good protection from wind and rain while still looking smart. It\u2019s well constructed with a durable cotton outer so we didn\u2019t have to worry about snagging it on brambles or barbed wire when we were walking off the extra helping of roast potatoes afterwards.\n\nBuy now\n\nBerghaus fellmaster: \u00a3165, Berghaus\n\nWith the guarantee of Gore-Tex you\u2019re not going to have to worry about wet conditions as the breathable membrane is tried and tested to keep you dry and cool. Adjustable cuffs and hood mean that the rain won\u2019t start leaking through the jackets openings. The material is comfortable, warm and allows for natural upper body movement.\n\nBuy now\n\nFinisterre litus: \u00a3160, Finisterre\u200b\n\nA nicely styled waterproof layer from the Cornish manufacturer, this jacket has a roomy fit which means you can wear extra layers underneath. The hydrophobic material keeps you bone dry on top. The adjustable hood, cuffs and hem ensure you don\u2019t get soggy around the edges and the jacket was one of the most breathable on test, so we had no problem staying cool even during an extended hill climb.\n\nBuy now\n\nMountain Hardware ozonic: \u00a3180, Cotswold Outdoor\n\nThis lightweight rain shell jacket has a good sporty fit and was very effective at taking the sting out of a biting wind. It was extremely stretchy and comfortable to wear over a day out on the trails and the sizeable zip vents under the arms mean that you can stop sweat and condensation build up.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Men\u2019s walking jackets\n\nA must for any walker\u2019s cloakroom, the Mammut broad peak light only requires a single layer underneath to keep you warm, even for higher ground walking. The jacket works with you while you walk and is so lightweight that it\u2019s barely noticeable while being worn. For wet conditions, the North Face apex flex offered one of the best mixes of waterproofing and wearability.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
