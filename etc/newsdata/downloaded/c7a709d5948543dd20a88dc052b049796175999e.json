Radical protesters, he said, were \u201cfoot soldiers of external forces and anti-China forces,\u201d bent on \u201cmaking Hong Kong chaotic and paralyzing the [local] government.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging the right of Hong Kong people to protest peacefully, Yang said violent unrest \u201cgravely endangered the interests\u201d of the territory and was \u201cnot at all about expressing any political demands\u201d but instead \u201cpolitical intimidation and hijacking, through and through.\u201d\n\nStriking a more conciliatory tone, he also urged Hongkongers to \u201cfocus on Hong Kong\u2019s economic development and improving the livelihood of Hong Kong people, offering their ideas and strategies and working on solutions together. The current crisis reflects Hong Kong\u2019s problems on very deep levels. It\u2019s time to pay attention and figure out solutions.\u201d\n\nHis rhetoric will do little to ease tensions in Hong Kong, where a three-month push for greater political freedom shows no sign of abating. Originating as opposition to a divisive extradition bill, the movement has since broadened into a rebellion against the unrepresentative local government, with many protesters demanding self-determination or independence for the semi-autonomous territory, whose 7.2 million inhabitants are culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland Chinese.\n\nThe notion of full political freedom for Hong Kong is anathema to Beijing, which resumed sovereignty over the former British possession in 1997, marking the end of 156 years of colonial rule.\n\n\u201cSome Western politicians have made comments about Hong Kong over the past three months,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThey waste no effort to encourage and support a few rioters and pro-Hong Kong independence people \u2026 they have helped facilitate these pro-Hong Kong independence actions.\u201d\n\nYang\u2019s remarks come after weeks of intensifying unrest in the territory. Over the weekend, protesters lobbed petrol bombs at Hong Kong\u2019s main government office, set fire to barricades on major streets, and fought running battles with police, who responded with tear gas and water cannon. At one point, police fired live rounds as warning shots in the prime retail and tourist district of Causeway Bay.\n\nOn Sunday, protesters severely disrupted operations at Hong Kong International Airport, forcing the suspension of train and bus services, leaving arriving passengers with no way of making it into the city center. Yesterday, thousands of high school and university students marked the first day of the new educational year with a class boycott. In the evening, masked radicals briefly clashed with police outside the offices of Hong Kong\u2019s embattled top official, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, and waved a defaced Chinese flag outside the headquarters of the Chinese garrison in a dangerous provocation.\n\nLam also held a press conference broadcast live Tuesday and said that Beijing had faith in her administration \u201cto handle this difficult matter, and we are also trying our best to do so.\u201d She also stressed that lawbreakers would be brought to justice.\n\n\u201cHong Kong is a society of law,\u201d she said \u201cso we must use the means of law to handle the illegal activities that have taken place.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong government has rounded up several prominent activists and democratic legislators in recent days, including the high profile campaigner Joshua Wong, his colleague in the Demosisto party Agnes Chow, and party chairman Ivan Lam.\n\nWong, who was bailed on charges of unlawful assembly, has vowed never to surrender. \u201cThis is the fight of our lives. And we\u2019re going to win. Whatever it takes,\u201d he posted on Twitter.\n\n\u2014With reporting by Aria Hangyu Chen and Hillary Leung / Hong Kong\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "China has doubled down on what it has termed a \"color revolution\" in the restive enclave of Hong Kong, dismissing protesters as \"thugs.\"", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/gettyimages-1171726008.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
