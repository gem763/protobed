And I went off on their ass, but part of the inspiration of me going back to see her and getting back to L.A., was one of the reasons I kicked their ass that night. I remember how I was feeling during that game and after that game. She inspired me.'\n\nBut then Khloe entered the picture.\n\nHe fell fast and hard for the TV star who was famous from Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nBut he never gave it straight to Taraji.\n\n'Things ended with Taraji because of me being an immature punk, I didn't know how to tell her that I was falling in love with another woman named Khloe Kardashian.'\n\nOdom's episode of TVOne's 'Uncensored' aires on Sunday, October 27 at 9 pm.", "description": "On Wednesday the 35-year-old beauty shared two new photos of her one-year-old daughter True, who she has with basketball star ex-beau Tristan Thompson.", "authors": ["Heidi Parker For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/20/20098240-0-image-a-96_1571858116853.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
