Calloway Accused of Sexual Assault by Two More Women: \u2018He Thought It Was a Game\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Last June, Sil Lai Abrams\u2019 Me Too story finally went public. And her testimony, which included sexual-assault allegations against Russell Simmons and Extra co-host A.J. Calloway, was an exceptional one.\n\nAs reported in The Hollywood Reporter, Abrams\u2019 attempt to speak out was nearly derailed. In January, Abrams taped an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid. After months of waiting, Abrams eventually came to learn that the network\u2014a subsidiary of NBC, which aired Extra\u2014had passed on her segment. Reflecting on her experience with NBC, Abrams told THR, \u201cThey took away my voice.\u201d\n\nAbrams\u2019 allegations eventually came to light thanks to the thoroughly reported June expos\u00e9. But the writer and domestic-violence awareness activist is still disturbed by the lack of impact, specifically when it comes to her allegations against Calloway. And now, two more women have come forward to The Daily Beast alleging that Calloway sexually assaulted them\u2014one of whom reported her claim to the police on Dec. 24.\n\nCalloway co-hosts Extra, a syndicated entertainment news show that was once considered an NBC \u201cstaple.\u201d But the network, which has been implicated in multiple damning reports in the Me Too era, from its refusal to run Ronan Farrow\u2019s Harvey Weinstein investigation to Matt Lauer, recently declined to renew the show. Beginning in fall 2019, Extra will move to Fox-owned stations in five major markets.\n\nMeanwhile, Abrams\u2019 testimony doesn\u2019t appear to have derailed Calloway\u2019s career\u2014he can still be seen dancing with the Rockettes on Extra and interviewing celebrities on the Women in Media Awards red carpet. Calloway has talked to Gloria Steinem, Ashley Judd, and Gretchen Carlson about sexual harassment and abuse. In October 2017, he discussed the importance of speaking out and supporting women of color. \u201cI spoke to a lot of women today, and that\u2019s one thing that they said, they said that African-American women are sexually harassed more than women of other races, or white women,\u201d Calloway told theGrio. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to support our sisters. We have to stand up for them.\u201d\n\nIn her 2007 memoir, No More Drama: Nine Simple Steps to Transforming a Breakdown into a Breakthrough, Abrams says she used pseudonyms for both Russell Simmons and A.J. Calloway. She referred to Calloway as a \u201cWell-spoken B-list celebrity\u201d named Ray, whom she recruited for a charity event.\n\nAfter the event, Abrams thanked Calloway for his participation, and they discussed her dream of starting her own non-profit. They proceeded to speak weekly on the phone about the non-profit. Abrams wrote that Calloway would repeatedly bring up the topic of sex; she explained, \u201cAlthough his behavior could be annoying at times, I chose to focus on his willingness to assist with my project instead of his inappropriate boundary testing.\u201d\n\nThe day after Christmas 2006, Abrams and Calloway met for a drink. Afterwards, he offered to drive her home. In her memoir, she recounts in detail how Calloway exposed himself to her in the car and then threw himself on her despite her protestations. Abrams narrates, \u201cPushing him away, I hissed, \u2018Let go\u2026I said let me go\u2026\u2019 as he started groping my right breast. My heart was racing\u2026all I wanted was to grab my purse and bag and get out of the car. But he wasn\u2019t having any of that. \u2018Touch it\u2026,\u2019 he said hoarsely, exposing himself again. \u2018This is so wrong\u2026just stop\u2026\u2019 I pleaded. He then tried to push my head down into his lap, but I wrested myself away. \u2018Just touch it\u2026,\u2019 he begged again, grabbing my hand and returning it to his rigid member. I gave up. Our struggle had been going on for close to six minutes and I figured he would leave me alone if I just let him do what he wanted. Ray continued to stroke himself for another minute until he climaxed, all over my hand and his. Reaching across me, he opened the glove compartment and pulled out a stack of napkins.\u201d\n\nThe THR piece repeated this testimony, and referenced two friends who confirmed that Abrams told them about the attack shortly after it occurred. In her memoir, Abrams writes that she reported the incident to the police\u2014which was corroborated by THR: \u201cShe filed a report and Calloway was arrested; Abrams still has copies of four orders of protection, and THR has reviewed them. (These orders of protection are restraining orders issued to prevent alleged perpetrators from harassing their accusers.) The statutes cited in the \u2018charges\u2019 section of the orders indicate that Calloway was charged under the sections of New York law related to forcible touching and attempted sexual misconduct offenses.\u201d\n\nThe case was reportedly dismissed \u201con procedural grounds.\u201d Calloway\u2019s attorney told THR that, \u201cThese decade-old allegations are false. They were false when they were first made and are false now. Mr. Calloway fully cooperated with law enforcement from the beginning, denied the allegations, and the case was completely dismissed in November 2007. After the case was dismissed, the court records were sealed as a matter of law and are no longer available.\u201d\n\nAbrams told The Daily Beast, \u201cWhen they say my case was dismissed on a technicality, that is the most vague answer possible. It was dismissed because his lawyer was able to invoke the Sixth Amendment after the Assistant District Attorney handling my case asked for one too many continuances and as a result violated his right to a fair and speedy trial. So the case was dismissed on a technicality, but I was willing to go to court and we were prepping to go.\u201d\n\nCalloway denied the allegations in a statement, saying, \u201cI was disappointed to read the false allegations about me in The Hollywood Reporter. As I have maintained from the beginning, these allegations are not true. When I was first notified about these allegations by law enforcement more than a decade ago, I fully cooperated from the beginning and the case was dismissed.\u201d\n\nHis attorney Lisa E. Davis told The Daily Beast, \u201cWith respect to the allegations by Ms. Abrams, Mr. Calloway has no further comment beyond his previous denial.\u201d\n\nAbrams, who began speaking out over a decade ago, hasn\u2019t stopped. \u201cI mean, in order to manufacture my allegations, I would have had to retroactively put them in my book in 2007 without naming them, hoping that a movement like Me Too would happen? I would have to have had the foresight to anticipate the Me Too movement and go on Al Jazeera and talk about my experience with Russell when I was being asked why women waited 25, 30 years to come forward during the Bill Cosby trial.\u201d\n\n\u201c What is the win in me going public about him? A criminal trial? I already tried to go through the justice system and it failed me. \u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the win in me going public about him? A criminal trial? I already tried to go through the justice system and it failed me,\u201d she continues. \u201cA civil lawsuit? Please. This has never been about money or notoriety. If that were the case, I certainly wouldn\u2019t have chosen to become a full-time advocate and activist.\u201d\n\nKim Masters, the THR journalist who broke Abrams\u2019 story, told The Daily Beast that neither Extra nor Warner Bros. Television, which produces the syndicated show, responded to requests for comment on the allegations. \u201cThat is unprecedented in my experience,\u201d Masters continued. \u201cWe just reported a story on allegations involving the Showtime series SMILF and we had a substantive response from ABC Studios, which produces the series, and a no comment from Showtime. From Extra and Warner TV, we did not even get a no comment regarding A.J.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do have to wonder whether race has something to do with this,\u201d adds Masters. \u201cI\u2019m willing to say that on the record because it\u2019s so unusual to me, and you know, this is a black woman making an on-the-record allegation in a reputable publication, where there\u2019s been an arrest, [so] I have to wonder whether race was an element in this.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite frankly,\u201d Abrams explained, \u201cRyan Seacrest went through an \u2018investigation\u2019 and the network issued a statement. Are you telling me that A.J. Calloway does not need to be held to the same standard as Ryan Seacrest? Are they ignoring us because we\u2019re women of color, is that why Warner Bros. refuses to comment? There\u2019s an inconsistency which is occurring here and I can\u2019t wrap my head around why.\u201d\n\nAbrams told The Daily Beast that in the wake of the Hollywood Reporter piece, she\u2019s been contacted by other women with sexual-misconduct allegations against Calloway. She puts the current count at 10 accusers, herself included. \u201cI spoke to these women, and they\u2019re terrified of coming forward...So when I was writing my Huffington Post piece about the impact coming forward has had on my life, I emailed Blake Bryant, the head of publicity at Warner Bros. Television\u2014the same guy who Kim Masters reached out to when she was working on her piece for The Hollywood Reporter\u2014asking him why they haven\u2019t issued any statements. I let him know that I\u2019d spoken with multiple women and there are multiple alleged victims of A.J. I was thinking, Warner Bros. has got to say something, I mean, what are they going to do? I got no response.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast reviewed this July email, in which Abrams mentioned that both she and Kim Masters had been approached by several accusers. Masters confirmed to The Daily Beast that, \u201cI spoke to three other women about AJ. I want to be really clear that while these women have stories that seemed potentially credible, we did not vet and report them.\u201d In her email, Abrams emphasized, \u201cI\u2019m specifically asking if any internal investigation has been taken and if Warner Brothers has any intention to comment on the allegations against Mr. Calloway.\u201d Abrams told The Daily Beast, \u201cWarner Bros.\u2019 response is no response.\u201d\n\nWhen reached for comment, Warner Bros. Television\u2019s Blake Bryant told The Daily Beast that, \u201c A.J. issued a personal statement last year which is public and available for your use.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe complete absence of comment and refusal to even acknowledge these allegations is worse,\u201d Abrams continued. \u201cWhat Warner Bros. is saying is that the trauma of sexual violence is so inconsequential that we won\u2019t even deign to comment on it. And this is a horrible message to send to survivors and to the public at large.\u201d\n\nOf the additional accusers, Calloway\u2019s lawyer, Lisa E. Davis, told The Daily Beast, \u201cWe cannot comment on vague secondhand allegations beyond that Mr. Calloway firmly denies any claim that he assaulted someone.\u201d\n\nAn accuser who wished to remain anonymous told The Daily Beast that she brought her allegation of sexual assault against A.J. Calloway to the West Orange Police Department in New Jersey on December 24. She explained that she spoke with multiple officers on that date, and was told that a detective would be reaching out to interview her.\n\nShe explained that she first reached out to Abrams in December \u201c because the first person I told didn\u2019t believe me, and I just happened to Google to see if anybody else had the same experience with the same person and her name popped up. So she was actually the first person I told him after the actual incident who actually believed me.\u201d She decided to go to the police \u201cwhen I found out I wasn\u2019t the only one.\u201d The West Orange Police Department confirmed that a complaint of aggravated sexual assault was filed on December 24. Due to the nature of the allegations, they were unable to release any further details on the complaint.\n\nAnother woman who reached out to Sil Lai Abrams agreed to talk to The Daily Beast on the condition of anonymity. \u201cI\u2019m terrified about coming forward,\u201d Talia* explained. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to affect my future, everything that I\u2019ve worked hard for\u2014and A.J. is someone that would try to do that.\u201d\n\nTalia told The Daily Beast that she first became aware of Calloway through mutual friends; they proceeded to connect on social media. \u201cHe started messaging me in 2011,\u201d she began. \u201cHe wanted to take me out to dinner and I kept telling him no, I wouldn\u2019t entertain his advances.\u201d The Daily Beast reviewed screenshots of messages between Talia and Calloway that seem to confirm his romantic pursuit of her. Talia said that she was wary of their age gap\u2014she was in her early twenties, and he was in his late thirties at the time. \u201cAfter him asking me out repeatedly I agreed to go, because it got to a point where he started to get upset that I was actually not willing to go out with him. He was kind of like, do you know who I am?\u201d\n\n\u201c That\u2019s when I started to realize, oh my God, this is serious. Like, he\u2019s really going to try and force me to have sex with him. \u201d\n\nAccording to Talia, she and Calloway went out for dinner. She recalled her date drinking heavily, and proceeding to invite \u201ca group of people to his home to party.\u201d Calloway was driving Talia that night. Once they arrived at his home with the group, she noticed that \u201che made everyone put their belongings on the kitchen table.\u201d The party proceeded downstairs to the entertainment room, which Talia said was complete with a home theater and a bar.\n\nAt around three in the morning, Talia remembered, Calloway walked the other guests out. When he came back, she recalled, \u201cWe started making out. And I knew I wasn\u2019t having sex\u2014I knew adamantly I wasn\u2019t having sex because I won\u2019t have sex unless I\u2019m in a committed relationship. So, you know, even though I\u2019m kissing him, I\u2019m thinking, this is the first date, we\u2019re just making out a little bit\u2014because I\u2019ve never even had sex on the first night with someone.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though he\u2019s tall and he looks skinny, he has some weight to him,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe\u2019s heavy, you know, and he put his whole body weight on top of me. He kept trying to open my blouse. He really was going for my skirt, and I was literally pulling my skirt down because I was not going to allow him to go any further. And he thought it was a game or something because he kept laughing and giggling and I\u2019m like, no, stop, stop. And the more I said stop the more he got aggressive, and that\u2019s when I started to realize, oh my God, this is serious. Like, he\u2019s really going to try and force me to have sex with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just remember trying to push him off of me, and this went on for 40 minutes straight,\u201d she continued. \u201cMe attempting to push him off of me and fighting to keep him from taking my clothes off. Eventually he got tired, and I think it\u2019s because he was so intoxicated\u2014it was wearing him out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I just remember him pulling his penis out and he began stroking himself and he kept trying to put my hand on his penis and eventually he ejaculated on my hands.\u201d\n\nTalia recalled wanting to \u201cget out of there\u201d but she didn\u2019t have a ride home. \u201cAfter what happened he said, \u2018I\u2019ll take you home in the morning, I promise.\u2019 It was like he was in denial about what he just did to me. And I didn\u2019t know what else to do, so I just agreed. I remember that the whole night he wrapped his legs around me, so I couldn\u2019t get away. I just remember trying to move and position myself where I could breathe because my face was in his chest, his legs were wrapped around me, his arms were wrapped around me, and that\u2019s how he slept the whole night until morning.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, Talia disconnected from the mutual friends she shared with Calloway, because she didn\u2019t \u201cwant to risk ever having to see him again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never wanted to tell anyone because I didn\u2019t think people would believe me because he was a celebrity and I was just a regular girl,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought that it\u2019s just one of those situations that happen and you just have to move forward with your life.\u201d\n\nThat was until she saw the article about Calloway featuring Sil Lai Abrams\u2019 testimony. \u201cWhen I saw it and I read what happened to Miss Abrams, I knew right then and there she wasn\u2019t lying. I was 150 percent sure that she wasn\u2019t lying because what she described was almost identical to what happened to me.\u201d\n\nTalia reached out to Abrams to \u201clet her know that I believed her because he did it to me, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted her to know that even if billions of people don\u2019t believe you, there\u2019s someone who can vouch that what you said is really true.\u201d\n\nTalia was shocked to learn that other women had reached out to Abrams with allegations against Calloway. \u201cIt was crazy because this whole time I thought my assault was an isolated incident because I had never heard anything about him that was negative after what he did to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the hardest part for me is every time I turn the TV on, he was on the television. He\u2019s on Extra, he\u2019s doing the Soul Train Awards or something and it would make me feel like\u2014not just disgusted, but low and defeated, like he gets to do whatever he wants and hurt people, and I have to live with the shame and pain of what he did to me.\u201d", "description": "Two more women have joined Sil Lai Abrams in alleging that the television host attacked them\u2014and one of them recently reported her claim to the police.
