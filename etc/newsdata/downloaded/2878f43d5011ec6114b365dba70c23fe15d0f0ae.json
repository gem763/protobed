I will continue to stay positive and be thankful that it was not worse,\" Winter said in a statement released to the local ABC network.\n\nOn Facebook, Paige's mother Marcy Goodrum Winter wrote that her daughter had come out of surgery and that, although she was still a bit drugged, had managed to keep her sense of humor.\n\n\"She wants everyone to know that sharks are still good people,\" her mother wrote.\n\nThe chances of being attacked by a shark are nearly one in four million, according to the International Wildlife Museum in Tucson, Arizona, but it does happen.\n\nLast September, a swimmer died from an apparent shark bite off the coast of Massachusetts in the northeastern United States.", "description": "A teenager lost part of her leg after being attacked by a shark while swimming off the coast of the southeastern United States, her family has said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7058/deafc21de6ad40329d387f5b10d4528b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-04"}
