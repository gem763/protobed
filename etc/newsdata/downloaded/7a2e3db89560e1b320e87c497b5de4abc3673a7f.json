Yeah, the days are getting shorter, the weather is going to shit, and I won\u2019t be able to sit in a park for another six months, but there\u2019s so much sweet new technology being launched. That makes all the other nonsense a bit more bearable.\n\nWe\u2019ve already had Apple announce its new iPhones in September. Then came Microsoft\u2019s exciting new Surface gear at the start of October. Now? We\u2019ve got Google\u2019s Pixel 4 launch event to look forward to. God, I\u2019m hyped.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel 4 launch event is taking place on Tuesday October 15 in New York City. Local time will be 10am ET. This equates to:\n\n7am for all you folks on America\u2019s West coast\n\n3pm in the UK\n\n4pm in Central Europe\n\n7:30pm in New Delhi\n\n1am on October 16 in Sydney\n\nIf you aren\u2019t lucky enough to be attending the event, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got you. All you need to do is wait until the appropriate time, then watch the video below. If you\u2019re worried about forgetting, you can also click through onto YouTube itself and have the site remind you when Google\u2019s Pixel 4 launch event is about to start.\n\nSimple, right? God bless technology. Now, onto the details.\n\nThe main announcement will be the Pixel 4. This phone has had so many details leaked we have a pretty clear idea of what it will be like (which you can read about in detail here). If you can\u2019t be arsed to click, the major news is the introduction of a 90Hz display, gesture controls, dual cameras on the rear, and the removal of the notch.\n\nAnother item set to be announced is a 5G version of the Pixel 4. This device is (supposedly) currently in test production, and could be quite a big scalp for Google if it launches a 5G device before Apple \u2014 something the Cupertino company won\u2019t (reportedly) do until 2020.\n\nThere\u2019s set to be a range of other announcements at Google\u2018s event. We expect to see the next generation of the Pixel Buds, and the now leaked Pixelbook Go laptop. One would assume the company will also talk about updates to Google Assistant, and shine some light on other software features.\n\nAnyway, all will be revealed on October 15 at 10am ET, so make sure you check back in on Plugged to stay on the bleeding edge of the news and head over to our Pixel 4 launch event page to get consistent updates.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "On October 15 Google will be unveiling a whole load of new gear.
