The lady might look Japanese, but she\u2019s Brazilian, descended from migrants who swapped East Asia for South America in the early 1900s. The workshop is one of many events organised by Japan House, an institute run by the Japanese government and designed to provide an insight into Japanese culture.\n\nThis building in Sao Paulo, created by the architect behind Tokyo\u2019s Olympic stadium, is clad in Japanese wood, and interior walls are lined with Japanese washi paper. On a first floor patio, above the palm tree-lined Paulista Avenue \u2013 the city\u2019s main artery \u2013 there\u2019s a tiny bamboo forest, and on the ground floor, near Japan House\u2019s caf\u00e9, a library filled with books which visitors are invited to borrow. The beautifully-curated gift shop is a treasure trove of Japan\u2019s best bits \u2013 woodblock prints, origami kits and Japanese tableware.\n\nAlthough there are Japan Houses in other countries, Sao Paulo\u2019s has the strongest ties with Japan. Marcelo Araujo, its president, tells me that he has regular meetings with Japan\u2019s consulate general in Sao Paulo and that it\u2019s the only city with connections to every Japanese prefecture. \u201cSome thought that the Japan House should be in the Liberdade neighbourhood,\u201d admits Araujo. \u201cBut Paulista Avenue is the city\u2019s heart, and this place is for everyone.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNearby Liberdade, otherwise known as the world\u2019s biggest Japantown, might not have the Japan House, but it does have the Museum of Japanese Immigration. And an enormous torii gate, towering over one end of Rua Galv\u00e3o Bueno, plus paper lantern-like street lights dangling from elegant red pillars. I discover a small, bamboo-filled Japanese garden and beautiful street art murals \u2013 one depicting a kimono-wearing Japanese lady surrounded by brightly coloured fish. Narrow side streets are filled with Japanese restaurants and izakayas (Japanese pubs), many with traditional noren door curtains.\n\nThe displays of fruit in Liberdade\u2019s grocery stores resemble the ones in Tokyo\u2019s depachikas (food halls). Alongside acai berries and papayas are enormous, individually-packaged mangos and melons \u2013 a nod to the Japanese love of gifting fruit.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

At the Museum of Japanese Immigration, I learn that two events prompted their arrival. In 1850, Brazil\u2019s slave trade was abolished. The country relied heavily on slaves \u2013 it\u2019s why the city of Salvador has the highest number of people of African descent outside Africa. In Sao Paulo, slaves worked the coffee plantations encircling the city. At the time, Japan was in crisis \u2013 the end of feudalism had left many rural Japanese destitute. The labour shortage on Brazil\u2019s plantations prompted the two governments to sign a treaty permitting Japanese migration to Brazil. The first wave arrived in 1908, onboard the Kasato Maru cargo ship.\n\nThe majority headed to Sao Paulo, which had the highest density of coffee plantations, many owned by farmers who treated their Japanese employees in the same way they\u2019d treated their African slaves. When demand for labour decreased, the majority of Japanese workers didn\u2019t have the means to return home. Instead, they preserved their culture by creating communities (such as the one in Liberdade), cultural associations and schools \u2013 there were 200 Japanese schools in Sao Paulo by 1932. They formed cooperatives and manufactured Japanese goods: silk, green tea and tatami mats, made from imported igusa reeds.\n\nMy guide at the Museum of Japanese Immigration is Sao Paulo local Patricia Takehana, whose grandparents migrated from Japan to Brazil. Her parents were born in rural Brazil, but moved to the city to attend university. She tells me she\u2019s been to Japan three times but speaks little Japanese, and considers herself Brazilian, adding that if Japan and Brazil faced each other in a football match, she\u2019d probably root for Brazil.\n\nToday 3.8 million people of Japanese descent live outside Japan. Half of these are in Brazil. Funnily enough, many seem to be at my hotel, the InterContinental Sao Paulo. Close to Liberdade, it\u2019s popular with Japanese travellers. There are matcha tea sachets in my mini-bar and although there might not be an onsen, the property has the highest number of bath tubs of any Sao Paulo hotel. Barman Sadrac tells me that one of the most popular cocktails is the sakerinha \u2013 a Japanese version (it\u2019s made with sake, not cacha\u00e7a) of the caipirinha, Brazil\u2019s national drink.\n\nFurther proof that Sao Paulo\u2019s connections with Japan remain as strong as ever is the weekend market which fills Liberdade\u2019s Pra\u00e7a da Liberdade. There\u2019s every type of Japanese food for sale, from ramen to okonomiyaki, and other stalls sell manga artwork and miniature torii gates emblazoned with \u201cI love Sao Paulo\u201d.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Ibirapuera Park\u2019s Japanese pavilion, with its koi carp-filled pond and priceless artefacts \u2013 including an Edo-period sword and 12th-century Japanese picture scrolls \u2013 donated by Sao Paulo\u2019s Japanese community. My favourite bit is the pavilion\u2019s grounds, where I find a Brazilian garden, filled with native species and directly connected to a Japanese Zen garden.\n\nIt reminds me of something said by Patricia Takehana: \u201cI\u2019ve got the best of both worlds right here.\u201d\n\nTravel essentials\n\nGetting there\n\nLatam flies from London Heathrow to Sao Paulo from \u00a3470 return.\n\nStaying there\n\nDoubles at the Intercontinental Sao Paulo from \u00a3165.", "description": "I\u2019m sitting in a beautiful, wood-clad building, watching a lady slide long-stemmed blooms into a vase while explaining the basics of Japanese flower arranging.
