Love mum and dad.\"\n\nNicola Wright also paid tribute to Helen, saying she and Kevin would \"finally get that beautiful wedding day wrapped in each others arms\".\n\nShe added: \"Be happy. Shine bright. Be all the things that you wanted to be. And above all never go to far away from us.\n\n\"Love and protect us in all the ways we cant do for each other.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\n\"Be the strength that keeps us on our feet when we fear we might stumble. Be the deep breath we take as we step into whatever our lives holds without you.\n\n\"We are lost, we are down and we are weakened but we will wont stay like that for long. We now have the most important job of all to do and thats be the pillars of strength, love, courage, patience, resilience, belief and compassion that will raise those boys into strong men.\n\n\"Men that will always know how much they truly truly are loved and how much their mum and dad fought to get them where they are today through all that life threw their way.\"\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nOne childhood friend, 39-year-old Lisa Johnson, previously told Mirror Online: \"This is a particularly sad story because her fianc\u00e9 suddenly collapsed and died in front of her at home two weeks before their wedding day.\n\n\"It left her to care for their two young boys. Instead of planning the final touches to her wedding day, she had to plan a funeral.\"\n\n\"She was absolutely distraught. She really struggled afterwards but was managing because of her two boys.\"\n\nLisa told how since Kevin's death in August last year, Helen's worried mum Linda had become increasingly concerned.\n\nA GoFundMe page has also been set up to support the family and Helen's two sons.\n\nThe page has raised almost \u00a33,500.", "description": "Helen Reilly, 35, from Cheshire, lost the 'love of her life' Kevin Reilly in 2018 - weeks before the couple were due to get married", "authors": ["Abigail O'Leary", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20379034.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Helen-OBrien.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
