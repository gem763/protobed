John McCain, Arizona Republican.\n\n\u201cNo offense, they crashed my dad\u2019s funeral. They get nothing from me,\u201d Ms. McCain said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally, they\u2019re not good people,\u201d Ms. McCain added.\n\nMr. Trump feuded publicly with McCain prior to his passing last August, and the late senator\u2019s family accordingly excluded the president from subsequent memorial services.\n\nMs. Trump, the president\u2019s eldest daughter, and her husband Mr. Kushner were among those who attended a memorial held for the senator at the National Cathedral in D.C, and Ms. McCain previously said that she was surprised to see them there.\n\n\u201cI thought that my family had made it clear, or at least I had, that the Trumps are unwelcome around me, and that my father had been sort of very clear about the line between the McCains and the Trumps,\u201d she told \u201cThe Late Show\u201d host Stephen Colbert in February.\n\nMs. McCain, 34, made the latest remarks about Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner while discussing a recent article published by The Atlantic about the president\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cThe idea that the hosts of The View or a reporter at The Atlantic have any factual reads on what goes on within the Trump family is completely asinine,\u201d White House spokeswoman Jessica Ditto told People magazine later Tuesday, the outlet reported.\n\nA former MSNBC and Fox News contributor, Ms. McCain has co-hosted \u201cThe View\u201d since late 2017.\n\nMs. Trump, 37, and Mr. Kushner, 38, have each served as White House advisers since early 2017. They wed in 2009.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
