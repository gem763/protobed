After Senator John McCain of Arizona passed away last year, his daughter Meghan delivered a fiery eulogy, telling the crowd that \u201cThe America of John McCain has no need to be made great again.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a sign of how even funerals are political in the Trump era, my colleague Russell Berman writes:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s yet another reminder of how broadly Trump has affected American public life in the past few years, his influence felt even in death and legacy. The president has changed how his rivals are mourned, even at funerals to which he was not invited.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Saahil Desai\n\nFeatured Reads\n\n(Emily Jan / The Atlantic)\n\nWhat\u2019s the experience of an archivist in a time of tragedy?
