I've excluded that,' said Judge William Orrick during the trial of Planned Parenthood v. David Daleiden.\n\nOver the last two weeks in the ongoing federal civil jury trial of Planned Parenthood against David Daleiden, Judge William Orrick has repeatedly cut off defense questioning that he considers straying too close to eliciting information related to Planned Parenthood\u2019s history of selling tissue from aborted fetuses.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is suing undercover journalist David Daleiden and others associated with his organization, Center for Medical Progress (CPM), alleging that Daleiden and his team committed illegal wiretapping, trespassing, breaches of confidentiality, and more. The challenge that Planned Parenthood attorneys have accepted is to make the case that Daleiden and his team illegally recorded private conversations, without admitting what exactly those conversations were about.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the plaintiffs who don\u2019t want the jury to consider the potentially illegal activities happening at Planned Parenthood clinics. Judge Orrick laid out the ground rules to the jury in his opening statements on Day One, saying this case \u201cis not about the truth of whether plaintiffs profited from the sale of fetal tissue or otherwise violated the law in securing tissue for those programs,\u201d and adding that, \u201cthose issues are a matter of dispute between the parties in the world outside this courtroom.\u201d\n\nOn day two of the trial, when defense attorney Horatio Mihet asked Daleiden\u2019s partner and CMP investigator, Sandra Merritt, about information she learned about the human tissue procurement company StemExpress from a Planned Parenthood whistleblower, Orrick ordered the court to take a break. He sent the jury out of the room and lectured Mihet for disobeying his orders to not discuss abortion procedures.\n\n\u201cI just want to be very clear that I want these witnesses to be able to testify as to what their reasonable state of mind was with respect to the specific defense\u2026but we\u2019re not going into the truth of abortion procedures. I\u2019ve excluded that,\u201d Orrick said.\n\nAnother defense attorney, Charles LiMandri, interjected, saying he didn\u2019t understand why the judge was precluding information their clients learned about Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion practice.\n\n\u201cIt would almost preclude the defense entirely, because part of showing what someone\u2019s reasonable belief is that reasonableness of the information they relied on and the source,\u201d LiMandri said.\n\nLater, when Merritt was asked to describe how a Stanford study used a device to keep intact fetal hearts beating and alive for experimentation, Orrick cut her off with an, \u201cAll right. Thank you.\u201d\n\nOn day three, CMP investigator Adrian Lopez testified that he was motivated to investigate Planned Parenthood\u2019s fetal tissue harvesting efforts when he saw an online order form for fetal body parts on StemExpress\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cYou go in there and it\u2019s basically a custom order for fetal tissue. You put \u2014 there is a drop-down menu for gestational age. There is a drop-down menu for what type of tissues you want, quantities and so forth,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYour Honor, may I show the witness a screen shot of that website?\u201d defense attorney Paul Jonna asked.\n\n\u201cNot \u2014 we can talk about it at the break, but tissue procurement organizations I\u2019ve already made rulings on with respect to this,\u201d Orrick said, deciding that he would not allow the defense to show the jury screenshots of the relevant StemExpress order form.\n\nPerhaps one of the more confusing rulings by Orrick was when he allowed Planned Parenthood\u2019s lawyers to play recordings of the undercover videos in question, but would not allow the same for the defense. As the jury deliberates over whether the undercover videos are considered \u201cprivate\u201d or \u201cconfidential,\u201d and therefore illegal under state law, the defense is barred from showing videos that could prove whether the videos were recorded in private settings. The judge did allow the defense to play some selected videos, but extra precaution was taken to make sure they were played without any sound or captions.\n\nAfter one video was shown, only to the witness on the stand and not to the jury, Jonna asked the judge if he would allow the witness to describe \u201ca little bit more about the content\u201d?\n\n\u201cHe can describe where people were, but he\u2019s already described that they were discussing abortion procedures. So that\u2019s as far as I\u2019m going to go at the moment,\u201d Orrick said.\n\nDespite the judge\u2019s restrictions, several admissions of baby body part trafficking were made by Planned Parenthood directors who took the witness stand.\n\nOn day four, Dr. Thomas Moran, associate medical director of Planned Parenthood Pacific Southwest, was asked about Planned Parenthood\u2019s supply of fetal organs to the aborted fetal organ wholesaler Advance Bioscience Resources.\n\n\u201cAnd as a result of abortions that would be performed there, including abortions you did, they would sometimes place a demand for certain organs, correct?\u201d the defense attorney asked.\n\n\u201cThat was certainly my understanding, yeah,\u201d Moran answered.\n\nOn day five, the former head of Planned Parenthood Northern California and Mar Monte, Dr. Leslie Drummond-Hay, said she was once asked to provide four intact limbs for StemExpress, and was successful in doing so. In one of the undercover videos recorded by Daleiden, Drummond-Hay said StemExpress was so impressed by her specimens, they got \u201coohs and ahhs.\u201d\n\nDuring cross examination, when asked what she meant by that, Drummond-Hay answered, \u201cThe tissue procurement company was happy with the specimen.\u201d\n\nThe trial continues on Wednesday, with additional dates currently scheduled through Nov. 15. The court has allotted each side 45 hours to present their case.\n\n[MORE: Planned Parenthood Fights To Hide Evidence Of Selling Fetal Tissue In Daleiden Trial]", "description": "'We're not going into the truth of abortion procedures.
