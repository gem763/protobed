But I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke,\" James said before the Lakers\u2019 preseason game against the Golden State Warriors on Monday at Staples Center. \"So many people could have been harmed, not only physically or financially, but emotionally and spiritually. Just be careful what we tweet, what we say and what we do. We do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative things that come with that too.\"\n\nProtestors in Hong Kong were seen burning James' jersey and criticizing the world's most popular NBA player for not speaking out about China's human rights violations or supporting free speech.\n\nBoston Celtics player Enes Kanter, who has not been able to visit his family in Turkey for five years after having his passport revoked and canceled a trip to London last year in fear of his life, tweeted ''FREEDOM IS NOT FREE.''\n\nWhen James was asked Tuesday if he understood where some of the criticism was coming from around talking about freedom of speech and human rights issues, he responded:\n\n\"It's a tough situation that we're all in. ... I think when an issue comes up if you feel passionate about it or you feel like it's something you want to talk about it, so be it. I also don't think that every issue should be everybody's problem.\n\n\"There's multiple things that happen in our own country that we don't bring up. Things that happen in my own community. ... I try to make sure the inner-city kids that grow up in my hometown can have a brighter future and look at me as inspiration to get out of the hell hole of the inner city. We don't talk about those stories enough.\n\n\" ... I think the best thing we can do is if you feel passionate about it, talk about it. If you don't have a lot of knowledge about it, I don't think you should talk about it. It can put you in a tough position.\"\n\nJames closed by saying he won't discuss the situation again, saying it would be ''cheating my teammates by continuing to harp on something that won't benefit'' the team.", "description": "LeBron James made headlines with his remarks Monday about China, Hong Kong and a pro-Hong Kong tweet, some would say for all the wrong reasons.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/15/USAT/5ca997ef-f7b5-490f-97c2-8a4f1352ede9-2019-10-14_LeBron_James2.JPG?crop=2841,2131,x407,y331&width=2821&height=2131&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
