Brown also stands to lose a $9 million signing bonus from the Patriots, who are due to make the first payment Monday but likely will not want to do so.\n\nBrown can seek recourse with a grievance filed through the NFL Players Association, and it appears that's what he plans to do. It's unclear if he'll seek recourse against the Raiders, Patriots, or both.\n\nBrown had taken a cordial tone toward the Patriots even after they cut him, but that all changed Sunday with the specter of the signing bonus being gone. So, first in Brown's sights was Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who reportedly was enraged by the receiver's threatening text messages to a woman who told Sports Illustrated Brown made unwanted sexual advances toward her. After those text messages surfaced, Kraft decided Brown was done in New England.\n\nStory continues\n\nAntonio Brown calls out Robert Kraft after @RapSheet reported the owner was behind the WR's release from the Patriots.\n\n\n\nHe says he's done playing in the NFL. pic.twitter.com/BTGLVd223Z\n\n\n\n\u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) September 22, 2019\n\n\"Caught in the parlor\" is in reference to Kraft's arrest on soliciting prostitution charges at a South Florida massage parlor earlier this year. Florida officials said last week that they still intend to prosecute Kraft on those charges.\n\nThe next target was former NFL tight end Shannon Sharpe, who has been a vocal critic of Brown on Twitter and his FS1 show \"Undisputed.\"\n\nAnd then it was Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, with whom Brown had a rocky relationship, leading to the receiver's exit from Pittsburgh after last season.\n\n.@AB84 has deleted these Sunday morning tweets that express contempt for #Patriots owner Bob Kraft, #Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger and HOF TE @ShannonSharpe. #NFL pic.twitter.com/kItmgGNq5W \u2014 Ron Clements (@Ron_Clements) September 22, 2019\n\nHe later deleted the tweets criticizing Kraft, Sharpe and Roethlisberger.\n\nBrown finished his rant by praising a Patriots fan who threatened Sports Illustrated writer Robert Klemko, who broke the news about further allegations against the receiver. That tweet also has been deleted.\n\nBrown reportedly had drawn interest from NFL teams, even as the league investigates the sexual-assault claims against him. It'd be surprising if that interest remains after another instance of Brown going off the rails.\n\nAntonio Brown vows to not play in NFL again, hints at filing grievance originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "Antonio Brown vowed never to play in in the NFL again, and hinted at contract grievances against the Raiders and the Patriots.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UltnXSd8bLN43ok2Tpb5pg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PHLCRxtmJc41cCK4yy1Xsw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/6c60b453c5c865e27bcf37d81cebb2f6", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
