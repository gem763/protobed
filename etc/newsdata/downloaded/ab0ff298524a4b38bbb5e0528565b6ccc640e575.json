Fuji,\" shows a man who identifies himself as TEDZU panting. \"I'm rushing to the peak,\" he says.\n\nThe man complains repeatedly about his cold fingers. \"My fingers are killing me. But I have to operate my smartphone. I should have brought a hot pack,\" he says.\n\nHe then tries various ways to warm his hands, including sticking one under his arm. The snow-covered path becomes narrower as he walks along a cliffside fence. Then the path slopes down and the man cautions himself against falling.\n\n\"Oh, this place is slippery, getting dangerous,\" the man says. \"I'm trying to walk by the rocks, yes, rocks. It's a steep downhill.\"\n\n\"Wait!\" he says. \"I'm slipping.\" The noise of his slide can be heard on the video.\n\nThe fall accelerates. The video shows him sliding feet-up, with his hiking sticks hurtling away, before it ends abruptly.\n\nMount Fuji's climbing season ended last month. There is no law prohibiting climbers from entering the mountain at other times, police say.", "description": "He complains in the stream about ice-cold fingers but says he needs them to work his phone to capture his ascent of Japan's highest mountain", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/30/9d8aba37-5f66-410a-89f7-c122067f8591/thumbnail/1200x630/a570f407fff0e6c2d8fc3391f5a7e666/rtr3egvs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
