Bovine tuberculosis is a disease of cattle that can also infect badgers, deer, goats, pigs, dogs and cats. The disease is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium bovis. This is related to the microbe that causes tuberculosis in humans. Bovine tuberculosis is typically transmitted aerially through coughs and sneezes. It causes fever, coughing, weight loss, pain, diarrhoea and ultimately death. Badgers are the most significant wildlife reservoir for the bacterium. In the United Kingdom, most bovine tuberculosis outbreaks occur in the South West and the West Midlands.\n\nEpidemiologist Sara Downs of the Animal and Plant Health Agency and colleagues studied the incidence of tuberculosis among cow herds in three UK regions where badger culling was taking place \u2014 Dorset, Gloucestershire and Somerset.\n\nResearchers compared regions where culling was in effect with zones where such was not being undertaken.\n\nMonitoring took place between 2013\u201317 for Gloucestershire and Somerset, and 2015\u201317 in Dorset.\n\nThe team examined which herds had at least one individual outbreak of tuberculosis, as confirmed by postmortem tests \u2014 a situation that causes the whole herd to lose its 'Officially Tuberculosis Free' with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\n\n'Industry-led culling was associated with reductions in cattle TB incidence rates after four years, but there were variations in effects between areas,' the team wrote.\n\nIn Gloucestershire and Somerset researchers found significant decreases in the number of tuberculosis outbreaks \u2014 falling by 66 and 37 per cent, respectively, in comparison with the areas were cullings were not taking place.\n\nHowever, the team also found no reduction in the incidence of the disease in Dorset at the end of the two-year study period.\n\nIn contrast to research published earlier this week, Dr Downs and colleagues saw decreases in the tuberculosis rates in the 'buffer zones' surrounding each culling area in Gloucestershire and Dorset.\n\nThe previous study had suggested that killing badgers would increase tuberculosis incidences around the cull zone as infected badgers would be encouraged to roam around more.\n\nThe authors also note that other factors associated with the granting of culling licenses \u2014 such as the introduction of other biosecurity efforts to mitigate the spread of the disease \u2014 could have also acted to minimise tuberculosis outbreaks.\n\nResearchers examined incidences of tuberculosis in cattle in areas with and without badger culls in three regions in England's south west\n\nOutbreak rates of the disease fell in two of the study regions, they found, but no significant effect was observed in Dorset after two years, they noted\n\nExperts have noted that the findings of this latest investigation were consistent with the results of a previous, large-scale study \u2014 the 10-year randomised badger culling trials (RBCT).\n\n'The latest analysis of the farmer led culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset suggests that large scale and long term killing of badgers can lead to a reduction in TB in cattle,' said University of Oxford zoologist John Krebs.\n\n'However, as the authors point out, the farmer led culls are not set up as a proper experiment and therefore one cannot be sure of the interpretation of the results.'\n\n'Furthermore, the authors report that in the RBCT under 6% of cattle infections came from badgers.'\n\n'All the recent scientific evidence points to a central role of cattle to cattle transmission, and focusing on killing badgers is probably a distraction from the main story.'\n\nEngland's controversial badger cull was introduced in 2013 and is now being enacted in 40 areas in an attempt to reduce transmission to cattle.

'This study suggests that culling is not working consistently across all tuberculosis-affected areas of England.'\n\n'There is no single measure that will provide an easy answer to beating the disease,' said a spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\n\n'That is why we are pursuing a range of interventions to eradicate the disease by 2038, including tighter cattle movement controls, strictly licensed badger control, regular testing and vaccinations.'\n\n'We recommend that evaluation of the effects from culling continues,' the researchers wrote in the conclusion of their paper.\n\n'We need to know whether the beneficial effects that have been observed on cattle TB continue and can also be observed in other culled areas.'\n\n'We also need to understand why an increase in tuberculosis incidence rates in cattle has not been detected in buffer zones surrounding culling areas.'\n\n'Culling badgers will not provide the entire solution to the cattle tuberculosis problem in Great Britain and the impact of the policy needs to be evaluated alongside other tuberculosis controls.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal Scientific Reports.", "description": "Experts led from the\u00a0Animal and Plant Health Agency studied TB rates among cow herds in three UK regions where badgers were being culled -\u00a0Dorset, Gloucestershire and\u00a0Somerset.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/11/19583322-0-image-a-14_1570790694711.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
