The Golden Lion previously put a spotlight on films that went on to be major awards season players, such as \"Roma\" and the film academy's 2018 best picture winner, \"The Shape of Water.\"\n\n\"I want to thank Warner Bros. and DC for stepping out of their comfort zone and taking such a bold swing on me and this movie,\" Phillips said with star Joaquin Phoenix by his side on stage.\n\nPhoenix did not win the best actor prize \u2014 it went to Italian actor Luca Marinelli for the Jack London adaptation \"Martin Eden\" \u2014 but the director of \"Joker\" dedicated much of his speech to the talents of his leading man.\n\nIn the film, he transforms from struggling stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck into Batman's classic nemesis.\n\n\"Thank you for trusting me with your insane talents,\" Phillips said to Phoenix.\n\nRoman Polanski's Dreyfus affair film, \"An Officer and a Spy,\" won the grand jury prize, which recognizes other strong contenders for the Golden Lion.\n\nPolanski, who fled the U.S. after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl and has been a fugitive for over 40 years, was not at the ceremony to accept the award.\n\nThe inclusion of \"An Officer and a Spy\" among the 21 films competing for the Golden Lion was widely criticized, although it was welcomed warmly by Venice Film Festival audiences. Jury president Martel issued a statement saying that while she does not \"separate the art from the artist,\" she bore no prejudice toward Polanski's film.\n\nRoy Andersson won best director for \"About Endlessness,\" although hip complications prevented him from accepting the award in person.\n\nActress Ariane Ascaride took the best actress prize for the French domestic drama \"Gloria Mundi.\" Olivia Colman won best actress in Venice last year for \"The Favorite,\" and went on to win the best actress Oscar.\n\nBest screenplay went to Yonfan for the animated film \"No. 7 Cherry Lane,\" about Hong Kong in 1967. He thanked Hong Kong for giving him the freedom to create.\n\nToby Wallace won best new talent award for his work in Shannon Murphy's \"Babyteeth.\"\n\n\"We can't believe we're here in general, so anything extra is super nice,\" Wallace said.\n\nHe thanked co-stars Eliza Scanlen and Ben Mendelsohn, as well as Murphy, his director. She was one of only two female directors in the main competition.\n\n\"(Murphy) led us into this project with so much honesty,\" Wallace said.\n\nAdapted from Rita Kalnejais' comedic stage play, \"Babyteeth\" is about an ill teenage girl who falls in love with a small-time drug dealer.\n\nThe jury that chose the winner of the Golden Lion and other top awards was headed by Martel, an Argentine director, and included director Mary Harron, actress Stacy Martin, cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and Toronto International Film Festival executive director Piers Handling.\n\nNotable films in the main competition leaving the Lido empty-handed include the Brad Pitt space epic \"Ad Astra,\" Steven Soderbergh's Meryl Streep-led Panama Papers comedy \"The Laundromat; and Noah Baumbach's divorce drama \"Marriage Story,\" with Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver.\n\nThe Venice Film Festival also handed out prizes to a diverse array of films in other sections, like Venice Classics, Virtual Reality and Horizons.\n\nIn Venice Classics, best documentary went to \"Babenco: Tell Me When I Die,\" about the late Brazilian filmmaker Hector Babenco, who was known for his socially conscious works.
