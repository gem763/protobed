Instead of 150 buses per hour on Albert and Slater, we'll see fewer than 10.\n\nThe parallel bus and LRT service is ending. You'll have to do the train.\n\nHave a great day!\n\nIf you have a traffic or commuter gripe about driving, cycling or being a pedestrian commuter \u2014 anything from problem intersections, to parking, to inefficient routes \u2014 send it to doug.hempstead@cbc.ca.\n\nAnd remember, you can share what you see on the roads with me on Twitter at @cbcotttraffic. Or give me a ring at 613-288-6900.", "description": "The bus situation downtown is going to\u00a0dramatically change Sunday, including the loss of a route running since 1980.", "authors": ["Cbc Ottawa'S Traffic Specialist", "Doug Hempstead Is Cbc Ottawa'S Traffic Specialist", "Can Be Heard On Cbc Radio'S Ottawa Morning", "All In A Day.
