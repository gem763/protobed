Countries like Japan are very important for us.\"\n\nVarious trade ministers pose for a photo after the signing ceremony of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in 2018. (Esteban Felix/Associated Press)\n\nThe Japanese market was a big reason Canada's agri-food exporters were excited when the CPTPP was ratified late last year. The deal quickly lifted some tariffs and began phasing others out.\n\nTariffs on Canadian fresh beef, for instance, have dropped to 26.6 per cent from 38.5 per cent; ultimately, they'll fall to nine per cent. Since the deal kicked in, Canadian beef exports to Japan have soared.\n\nCiting federal data, the Canadian Cattlemen's Association said the volume of beef exports to Japan climbed to nearly 22,600 tonnes through the first half of the year \u2014 up more than 62 per cent over the same period last year.\n\n\"I feel safe in saying it's going to be our best year ever in Japan,\" said John Masswohl, director of government and international relations for the Canadian Cattlemen's Association.\n\nCanadian pork producers are among those watching to see how a U.S.-Japan trade deal will impact their industry. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nTrade with Japan, as well as the other nations included under the CPTPP, appears even more important in the wake of China's decision to put restrictions on various Canadian exports, including pork and beef.\n\nBut Canada's inroads in Asia aren't the sort of thing that goes unnoticed south of the border, especially as President Donald Trump balked at joining its precursor, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).\n\nThe farming lobby has been \"pressuring\" Trump to get a deal with Japan, said political scientist Yves Tiberghien, co-director of the Centre of Japanese Research at the University of British Columbia.\n\nThe U.S. trade war with China, which has been tough on American farmers, only ratcheted up the urgency.\n\nIn turn, Tiberghien said, the White House had been putting \"enormous\" pressure on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nThen at the recent G7 meeting in France, Trump and Abe announced they had an agreement in principle and would aim to sign a final deal in New York by the end of September.\n\nCanada's cattle sector saw its beef exports to Japan soar earlier this year after the CPTPP kicked in. (Sarah Lawrynuik/CBC)\n\nThe outcome of the talks isn't certain and terms of the deal are said to still be under negotiation. Bloomberg News reported this week that trade officials are still discussing how much Japan is willing to open its agricultural market to U.S. imports.\n\nSome experts anticipate that when a deal is finalized, Canadian and U.S. food producers will be on even terms in Japan.\n\n\"The short-term advantage that Canada had relative to the U.S. under [CPTPP] will likely go away \u2014 if and when that agreement is reached,\" said Mike von Massow, a food economist at the University of Guelph.\n\nIf the deal happens, American producers will likely push hard to regain any market share they may have lost, said Carlo Dade, director of the trade and investment centre at the Canada West Foundation.\n\n\"I think they may price aggressively,\" Dade said. \"That's what I would do.\"\n\nBut Dade said Japanese tariffs aren't the whole ballgame when it comes to the CPTPP, which includes Canada and 10 other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including Australia, Vietnam and Malaysia.\n\nCarlo Dade, director of the trade and investment centre at the Canada West Foundation, expects the tariff advantages Canadian meat exports have enjoyed over the U.S. in Japan will end if the Americans strike their own deal. (CBC)\n\nFor example, American exporters may sell cheaper goods into Japan. But, Dade explained, the CPTPP contains rules that would restrict Japanese firms from using those goods to make something else by entering them into the supply-and-production chain. Canadian exports to Japan don't face those restrictions.\n\n\"That advantage remains with us,\" Dade said.\n\nIndeed, von Massow said it's significant the U.S. is seeking a bilateral deal with Japan rather than join the TPP.\n\n\"The other countries, Vietnam and others, we still have an advantageous position \u2014 and that's where we really saw the biggest potential for growth. And I expect that's where we're prioritizing,\" he said.\n\nStill, Canada's pork and beef sectors are watching for details as the U.S.-Japan talks unfold.\n\nMasswohl sees a potential upside for the Canadian cattle sector if tariffs on U.S. beef fall: It would mean more money in the hands of Japanese buyers, he said, who will then have more money to spend.\n\n\"We also sell a lot of cattle into the U.S.,\" Masswohl said. \"For U.S. exporters to be making more money in the Japanese market can only be good for them buying Canadian cattle.\"", "description": "Canada's tariff advantage over the United States in beef and pork exports to Japan is in question as the White House pressures Tokyo for new trade pact this month.", "authors": ["Senior Producer Western Digital Business Unit", "Tony Seskus Is Senior Producer With Cbc'S Western Business Unit In Calgary.
