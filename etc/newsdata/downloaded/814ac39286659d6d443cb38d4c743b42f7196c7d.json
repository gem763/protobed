For example, if a company's top executive makes between 50 and 100 times more than the median worker, its corporate tax penalty is 0.5 of a percentage point. If the ratio is more than 500, the tax penalty ratchets up to 5 percentage points.\n\nHad the plan been instituted in 2018, McDonald\u2019s would have paid up to $110.9 million more in taxes, JPMorganChase would have paid up to $991.6 million more in taxes, Home Depot would have paid up to $538.2 million more in taxes, and American Airlines would have paid up to $18.8 million more in taxes, the Sanders campaign said.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % MCD MCDONALD'S CORP. 214.71 +1.55 +0.73% JPM JP MORGAN CHASE & CO. 117.69 -0.03 -0.03% HD THE HOME DEPOT INC. 232.02 +2.16 +0.94% AAL AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC. 26.97 -0.04 -0.15%\n\n\"If companies increased annual median worker pay to just $60,000 and reduced their CEO compensation to $3 million they would not owe any additional taxes under this plan,\" the Sanders campaign said.\n\nSanders estimates the tax will raise $150 billion in 10 years, which would be used to eliminate medical debt.\n\nEarlier in September, Sanders released a sweeping plan to tax the wealth of the richest Americans, including one that he said would slash the wealth of billionaires in the U.S.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "Sanders' \"Income Inequality Tax Plan\" would\u00a0impose tax rate increases on companies with CEO to median worker ratios above 50 to 1.", "authors": ["Evie Fordham"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/c8c5d583-bernie-sanders-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
