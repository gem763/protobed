I have been in contact with his friends and he never got in touch with his friends,\" she said.\n\nHardy said it's deeply worrying that her son hasn't signed into his social media accounts since that afternoon, or even turned his phone on.\n\n\"He has just basically disappeared from communication and the public eye.\"\n\nTwo Ottawa families have been searching different corners of this city for their loved ones. 8:45\n\nSearch party\n\nWith help from volunteers, Hardy has been out searching the woods and forests areas near their Blossom Park home.\n\nShe said the extra help is incredibly important, because police resources are strained.\n\n\"They don't have the manpower to deal with every missing child and person that comes through the door, as much as they want to,\" she said.\n\nBaron is a Caucasian male who is approximately five-foot-eight inches tall and weighs 115 pounds. He has short brown hair and brown eyes, and was last seen wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and blue jeans.\n\nHardy said her son really enjoys the outdoors and hopes people will keep an eye out for him.\n\n\"He tends to be a woodsy-type person,\" she said. \"He is very outdoorsy, and so you might see him out in the woods.\"", "description": "Alexandre Baron has been missing since Tuesday afternoon, when he stormed out of his Blossom Park home following an argument.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5336478.1572043163!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/alexandre-baron.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
