The Astros hit seven homers overall and pounded Oakland 15-0.\n\nThe Astros have won five in a row and next take on A\u2019s righty Tanner Roark (9-8, 3.86 ERA). Wade Miley (13-4, 3.35) starts for host Houston.\n\nTROUT OUT\n\nAngels star Mike Trout has undergone a cryoablation procedure to alleviate pain in his right foot. Manager Brad Ausmus described the procedure as relatively minor and said the slugging outfielder could return later this series against Cleveland.\n\nTrout has been bothered by nerve pain in his foot for several weeks, but has largely played through it. The cryoablation procedure uses extreme cold to essentially deaden the tissue around the irritated nerve.\n\nTrout is batting .291 with an AL-leading 45 homers and 104 RBIs. His .438 on-base percentage leads the majors.\n\nNICE START\n\nTouted prospect Nico Hoerner had three hits and four RBIs in his big league debut, helping the Cubs increase their lead for the second NL wild-card spot.\n\nHoerner also made some nice plays at shortstop Monday night as Chicago beat San Diego 10-2 to snap a three-game losing streak. The Cubs lead Milwaukee by two games.\n\nThe 22-year-old Hoerner, the Cubs\u2019 first-round draft pick out of Stanford in 2018, was promoted from Double-A Tennessee earlier in the day because All-Star shortstop Javier B\u00e1ez and Addison Russell are sidelined by injuries.\n\nWELCOME BACK\n\nGiants right-hander Johnny Cueto makes his season debut after recovering from Tommy John surgery. The two-time All-Star hasn\u2019t pitched in a major league game since July 28, 2018. He starts at home against Pittsburgh.\n\nCLOCKED\n\nBig league bullpens are full this month, boosted by September call-ups, and a plethora of pitching changes is contributing to longer and longer games.\n\nThe Brewers beat Miami 8-3 Monday night in a matchup that took 4 hours, 8 minutes. The game featured 15 pitchers who combined for 14 walks.\n\nOn Sunday, the Phillies topped the Mets 10-7 in 4:29 - one minute from matching the longest nine-inning NL game. Each team used eight pitchers and the clubs used up all 16 dozen baseballs that were prepped pregame, forcing another couple dozen to be rubbed up and put in play.\n\nMATCHED UP\n\nThe Braves have won 90 games this year, matching their total from last season when they took the NL East. At 90-55, they lead the division by 9 1/2 games over Washington.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very good number, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of baseball to play, so hopefully we get a lot more.\u201d\n\nLefty Max Fried (16-4, 3.86 ERA) tries to add to Atlanta\u2019s total when he starts at Philadelphia against Jason Vargas (6-7, 4.27).\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors today:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/athletics_astros_baseball_25050_c312-0-4862-2653_s1770x1032.jpg?f15b1c3e9d92eb0e68f91cbb38bde45fd85a0760", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
