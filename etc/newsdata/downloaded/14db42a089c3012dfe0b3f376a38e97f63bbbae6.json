Bella also came second behind Scarlett Johansson for the positioning of her eyes.\"\n\n(Image: BellaHadid/Instagram)\n\n(Image: Getty Images North America)\n\nHe added: \"Beyonc\u00e9 ran her a close second, scoring the highest marks for the shape of her face (99.6%) and getting very high scores for her eyes, brow area and lips.\"\n\nHowever, Bella may have a little helping hand in the looks department.\n\nShe's previously sparked speculation that she underwent a nose job as a teenager when pictures of her pre-fame emerged, showing her looking very different.\n\nBut the supermodel has kept tight-lipped about any work she might have had done, telling InStyle magazine last year that she was \"scared\" of going under the knife or having fillers injected into her face.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"People think I got all this surgery or did this or that,\" she said. \"And you know what? We can do a scan of my face, darling. I'm scared of putting fillers into my lips. I wouldn't want to mess up my face.\"\n\nAnd in April 2018, after being accused of having a nose job and lip fillers by an Instagram troll, Bella clapped back.\n\nShe wrote: \"Blessings to you sweetheart. Jealousy is a cry for help that I wish I could help you with.\"\n\nBella's lips got suspiciously bigger in October 2018, prompting yet more rumours that she'd had fillers.\n\nBut she's yet to reveal the truth about her changing features.", "description": "Supermodel Bella Hadid, 23, fits the so-called 'Golden Ratio' rule because of the placement of her facial features, claims a surgeon", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Dr Julian De Silva", "Cavendish Pr", "Bellahadid Instagram", "Getty Images North America", "Instagram", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13538370.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_The-DAILY-FRONT-ROW-Fashion-Los-Angeles-Awards-Show.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
