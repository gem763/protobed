But when you think about it, maybe 15 years isn't actually that long of a wait. Particularly for fans who thought they might never release a new album again.\n\nThe band \u2014 currently made up of Dave Bidini, Dave Clark, Martin Tielli, and Tim Vesely, plus special guests Kevin Hearn and Hugh Marsh \u2014 called it quits back in 2007, after making music together for nearly 30 years.\n\nRheostatics new album, Here Comes the Wolves, is out now. (Lyle Bell )\n\nThrough their hiatus, the band members would fall back into each others' orbits. After a while, the pull got strong enough to coax them back into the studio. The result is Rheostatics' first album in 15 years Here Come The Wolves. It's packed with everything from trademark Canadiana references to a loving nod to Gord Downie.\n\nBand members Dave Bidini and Dave Clark joined guest host Angeline Tetteh-Wayoe in the q studio to reflect on regrouping as a band during the recording process and the nearly 40 years that have passed since Rheostatics first performed together.\n\nRheostatics new album Here Come The Wolves is out now. They are kicking off their tour next month on Nov. 15th in Omemee, Ontario at The Coronation Hall. You can see the full list of upcoming Ontario shows here.\n\n\u2014 Produced by \u200bEmma Godmere\n\nDownload our podcast or click the 'Listen' link near the top of this page to hear the full conversation with Rheostatics.", "description": "Rheostatics, one of Canada's longest-running indie rock bands, just released their first new album in 15 years.
