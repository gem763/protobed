Get Me Out Of Here! jungle isn't quite as wild as viewers are led to believe.\n\nThe hit ITV show plonks a load of celebs in the middle of the Australian jungle, where they have to live off rations of rice and beans unless they win enough stars in tasks to earn a proper meal.\n\nThey'll come face-to-face with a number of creepy crawlies and wild beasties, but it's not as extreme as you might think.\n\nReigning King of the Jungle Harry Redknapp, who famously went on the show without watching it first, said he thought the jungle camp was actually a set, and that after filming wrapped they could pop round the back for a cuppa and a bacon sandwich.\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nTo his horror, he discovered the catering wasn't as elaborate as he'd hoped.\n\nBut the stars aren't fully living in the jungle either.\n\nThe show actually sets up camp inside Springbrook National Park.\n\nThe park, in Queensland, has served as the setting for the show since 2003.\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: Wikipedia)\n\nViewers only see the camp, suspension bridges to the studio and the clearings where tasks take place, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes.\n\nOff screen, there's an on-site medical facility, a space for props to be stored and an area where family members and friends of the campmates gather on the morning of each eviction.\n\nSpringbrook National Park is a stunning 15,000 acre space and a protected site.\n\nIt's home to several beautiful waterfalls and of course, a lot of wildlife.\n\n(Image: NIGEL WRIGHT/ITV)\n\n(Image: Wikipedia)\n\nThis year's I'm A Celeb will see the return of Ant McPartlin.\n\nLast year, Holly Willoughby hosted the show alongside Dec Donnelly as Ant took a break from television to focus on his recovery.\n\nAnt was absent from the screen for most of the year following his drink-driving conviction.\n\nThe Geordie duo's old pal Holly stepped in to fill the void, but Ant will be back for the new series.\n\n(Image: Rex Features)\n\nAnt and Dec shared a promo clip of themselves this week, and fans said they couldn't wait to see them back together Down Under.\n\nOne commented: \"Hey boys I can't wait I'm so excited\"\n\n\"Can't wait for it to come on,\" another said.\n\nWhile another wrote: \"Yessss something to look forward to\"\n\n* I'm A Celebrity returns to ITV in November\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
