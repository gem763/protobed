Once the compromises begin, they can\u2019t be contained. They\u2019ll seep into every corner of the institution, corrupting good purposes and damaging people\u2019s lives.\n\nAnd so it is with the Southern Poverty Law Center \u2014 one of progressive America\u2019s most influential and storied civil-rights organizations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn\u2019t news to conservatives, of course. For those who cared about truth, the SPLC\u2019s transformation from a valuable anti-Klan watchdog into a glorified version of Media Matters for America was plain and obvious. It steadily expanded its definition of \u201chate groups\u201d to include mainstream Christian organizations such as my former employer, the Alliance Defending Freedom, and it labeled as \u201cextremists\u201d men such as American Enterprise Institute scholar Charles Murray.\n\nThese decisions had serious real-world consequences. Corporations and employers cut off relationships with groups and individuals targeted by the SPLC, and violent people used SPLC designations to justify attempted murder and assault. Remember the man who tried to commit mass murder at the Family Research Council? He found his target through the SPLC\u2019s list of alleged \u201canti-gay groups.\u201d Remember when an angry mob attacked Murray at Middlebury College and injured a professor? Because of the SPLC, those protesters thought they were attacking a \u201cwhite nationalist.\u201d\n\nMoreover, its methods of determining hate and extremism are so shoddy and corrupt that it\u2019s been forced to dole out a multimillion-dollar settlement to Maajid Nawaz, a British Muslim whom it hysterically dubbed an \u201canti-Muslim extremist.\u201d In fact, Nawaz is a former Islamist who now dedicates his life to combating extremism. The SPLC was also forced to apologize for posting an \u201cextremist file\u201d on Ben Carson. Yes, Ben Carson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet still the donations rolled in. Still the media and progressive corporations valued the organization enough to apply its hate labels to good and decent Americans \u2014 people I know and respect. Will they value it still, as the SPLC\u2019s internal corruption is made plain?\n\nThe past few days have brought a series of reports from otherwise-sympathetic media outlets that have painted the organization in an extraordinarily unflattering light. On March 14, the SPLC fired its co-founder, legendary trial lawyer Morris Dees. Within hours, the Los Angeles Times wrote that the SPLC \u201chas been wrestling with complaints of workplace mistreatment of women and people of color.\u201d\n\nThe climate was apparently so bad that two dozen employees signed a letter to the board of directors declaring that \u201cthey were concerned that internal \u2018allegations of mistreatment, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, and racism threaten the moral authority of this organization and our integrity along with it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe hits kept on coming. Six days later, The New Yorker published a lengthy essay by Bob Moser, a former writer at the SPLC. It begins with this stinging statement:\n\nIn the days since the stunning dismissal of Morris Dees, the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, on March 14th, I\u2019ve been thinking about the jokes my S.P.L.C. colleagues and I used to tell to keep ourselves sane. Walking to lunch past the center\u2019s Maya Lin\u2013designed memorial to civil-rights martyrs, we\u2019d cast a glance at the inscription from Martin Luther King, Jr., etched into the black marble \u2014 \u201cUntil justice rolls down like waters\u201d \u2014 and intone, in our deepest voices, \u201cUntil justice rolls down like dollars.\u201d The Law Center had a way of turning idealists into cynics.\n\nIn the pages that followed, he described a place with an \u201cuncomfortable\u201d racial dynamic where female staffers were \u201cwarned by their new colleagues about Dees\u2019s reputation for hitting on young women.\u201d He described how another former writer called the place a \u201c a virtual buffet of injustices\u201d with problems \u201cracial, sexual, financial.\u201d\n\nOn March 19, the SPLC announced that it was hiring an outside lawyer to \u201creview its workplace environment and policies.\u201d Three days later, Richard Cohen, the president of the SPLC, stepped down. And yesterday, the New York Times published an almost 2,000-word report on the SPLC\u2019s \u201cintolerance within\u201d:\n\nCurrent and former employees said Mr. Dees\u2019s dismissal was only part of the turbulence rattling a social justice organization afflicted by morale issues, staff turnover and a sense that the center has not embraced the values that it champions across the country.\n\nOh, I disagree. Given the intolerance and bad faith it exhibited in its evaluations and assessments of all too many conservatives and Christians, I\u2019d argue that the SPLC has embraced exactly the values it champions. It\u2019s intolerant through and through.\n\nIntolerant and fraudulent, in fact. In a scorching piece in Current Affairs, Nathan Robinson points out the hysterical exaggerations in the SPLC\u2019s assessment of hate groups. It essentially manufactures fear. This paragraph is amazing:\n\nWhat\u2019s to be done? The SPLC can sort itself out. Hopefully it can rediscover its roots and focus its efforts on combating white supremacy and renew its commitment to poverty law. There was a time when it would represent indigent death-row inmates, for example, and there remains ample opportunity to do good for America\u2019s poorest citizens. The SPLC has an almost half-billion-dollar endowment. You can hire a lot of lawyers with that kind of cash.\n\nBut the rest of the world should move on. The rest of the world should recognize that a corrupt organization has generated corrupt assessments of its fellow citizens, and it should be ignored. We don\u2019t need the SPLC to spot white supremacists, and we certainly don\u2019t need the SPLC to evaluate religious doctrines \u2014 be they Christian, Muslim, or Jewish.\n\nThis organization has devolved from helping people to hurting people, but it only has the power that the media and progressive corporations give it. Now, every single time a media organization or a company uses the SPLC\u2019s listings, it should be held to account. There is no excuse. The emperor has no clothes.
