SoftBank Group Corp., its largest outside investor, is now targeting $8 billion through a rescue package it\u2019s putting together, according to Bloomberg News. But Masayoshi Son ought to be careful. While the deal may set a floor under WeWork, it could also diminish his standing along with SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund.\n\nMere months ago, WeWork was seeking an IPO at a $47 billion valuation, now withdrawn amid whispers that the real value should be closer to $15 billion. SoftBank\u2019s new plan goes even further and represents an 83% haircut that means serious pain for The We Co., founder Adam Neumann, and other shareholders including venture-capital investors and employees.\n\nIf SoftBank pulls it off, the move would cement Son\u2019s reputation as a feared dealmaker, one that earned him the nickname Big Stack Bully. That\u2019s because SoftBank would be a huge beneficiary of such a massive down round while everyone else could be clear losers.\n\nThe Vision Fund(1) paid top dollar when it built its stake of around 29% in the office rental startup. By buying more shares, at an $8 billion valuation, Son might get to increase his stake while lowering the average price at which he paid. That would boost any possible upside from a future IPO, even if it were to happen at a substantial discount to $47 billion.\n\nWhile talks are fluid and terms could change, as Bloomberg noted, a likely result of such a rescue package is that existing shareholders might lose on all counts: Their stakes get diluted and the value of their investment gets slashed, yet they\u2019re stuck with a much higher average price of acquisition. Shareholders who didn\u2019t pay cash for their stakes, such as employees, wouldn\u2019t suffer that third consequence, though they\u2019re no less disadvantaged since they\u2019ve effectively bartered cash salary for shares.\n\nWhat would be more troubling than SoftBank making this offer is WeWork\u2019s board actually accepting it.\n\nCurrently, they\u2019re weighing up two options: the SoftBank equity deal and a debt package being put together by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Many board members will also be equity holders \u2014 representing investors such as VCs \u2014 so anything that cuts their stake or valuation wouldn\u2019t be welcome. Debt, on the other hand, transfers risk to bondholders.\n\nGiven WeWork\u2019s current financial situation, though, debt investors have been growing increasingly skeptical of the company. Its 2025 U.S. dollar bonds plunged over the past month, with the JPMorgan-led financing package reported to include debt with yields as wide as 15%. Taking the SoftBank package would likely indicate that JPMorgan couldn\u2019t put together an attractive enough deal for its consortium of about 100 investors to stomach.\n\nIt could be a pyrrhic victory for Son, though. I recently argued that his reputation is more important than his stake in WeWork. The Vision Fund should be able to write down that investment to zero and still churn out attractive returns. But there are signs that the halo surrounding Son and SoftBank is starting to fade.\n\nJapan\u2019s Finance Ministry plans to close a tax-avoidance loophole that SoftBank used to its advantage, Nikkei reported Sunday. The company paid no tax in Japan last year thanks to a series of complex paper transactions that booked losses by shifting assets within the group, according to the newspaper. In other words, a good portion of SoftBank\u2019s returns last year came not from savvy investing but merely from exploiting tax laws.\n\nThat sort of thing feeds into an increasing distrust by regulators and the general public for tech companies and their billionaire bosses who dodge taxes, no matter how legally. SoftBank and Son need trust to raise a second $107 billion Vision Fund, get regulatory approval for the merger of its U.S. telco Sprint Corp., and have continued access to the best deals in the startup world. Forcing a haircut of this scale on WeWork at its weakest moment, and at the expense of other stakeholders, won\u2019t help build that kind of confidence.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- WeWork\u2019s valuation keeps sliding.
