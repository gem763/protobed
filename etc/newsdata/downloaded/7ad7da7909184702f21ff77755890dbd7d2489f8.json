The allegation, denied by Trump and Zelensky, triggered the impeachment probe.\n\nHouse Democrats and their media backers, however, are moving away from the call now that testimony on the July 25 conversation between Trump and Zelensky is proving fruitless in pushing the quid pro quo narrative.\n\nSome Democrats and the media are now claiming Trump abused his power, irrespective of whether there was a quid pro quo during the call, expressly or implicitly involved.\n\nBoth California Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff, the leader of the impeachment probe, have said a quid pro quo is not necessary to remove Trump.\n\nThe decision to move beyond the July 25 conversation suggests that Trump did nothing wrong during the call, which is something the U.S. president and his Republican allies have been saying since the imb\n\nOn Monday, Pelosi capitulated to Republican demands and agreed to hold a vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry. Pelosi\u2019s decision indicates that Republican criticism that the impeachment probe is illegitimate has merit.\n\nEchoing impeachment inquiry witnesses, the New York Times acknowledged that Ukraine was unaware that the Trump administration was withholding aid at the time of the call. Ukraine did not find out the U.S. had frozen the aid until days after the call.\n\nReferring to that revelation, Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX), who has witnessed the impeachment probe depositions, declared, \u201cYou can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo,\u201d Trump noted via Twitter on October 23.\n\nThat inconvenient truth is now prompting the mainstream media, echoing the Democrats\u2019 position, to say the alleged quid pro quo offer at the heart of the impeachment probe \u201cevolved over time.\u201d\n\nThe lack of evidence to support the allegation that Trump made a quid pro quo offer during the July 25 call has left Democrats scrambling \u201cto find a smoking gun or pieces of one,\u201d Politico conceded on Monday.\n\nWhile one impeachment witnesses \u2014 Amb. Bill Taylor \u2014 said a quid pro quo took place, citing second-hand information, others have said they were unaware of a pressure campaign to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nIn another sign that the Democrats are moving away from the July 25 call, they are heavily relying on Taylor\u2019s deposition to fuel their impeachment efforts.\n\nTaylor\u2019s claim that Trump attempted to pressure Ukraine to investigate Bidens was unrelated to the July 25 call.\n\nDemocrats pursuing the impeachment probe are supposed to be trying to determine whether Trump abused his power by demanding the investigation into the Bidens during the July 25 call.\n\nImpeachment-minded House Democrats have repeatedly claimed there was a quid pro quo during the call, explicit or implied.", "description": "The media and Democrat allies are moving away from the July 25 phone call, saying the alleged quid pro quo offer \"evolved over time.\"", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/telephone-call-white-house-donald-trump-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
