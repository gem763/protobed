One, it was super late. Like, a month late. And two, it has some really out-there lyrics. In the past, between Bible verses and religious imagery, Kanye made room for lyrics like old kickers \u201cCouldn\u2019t afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus,\u201d from \u201cAll Falls Down,\u201d and \u201cHurry up with my damn croissants\u201d from \u201cI Am a God.\u201d The content in Jesus Is King is a little heavier, but food and obscure references still stick out among his newer political statements. Here are a few of the lyrics that had us thinking, \u201cI miss the old Kanye.\u201d\n\n\u201cSelah\u201d\n\nEverybody wanted Yandhi / Then Jesus Christ did the laundry\n\nVery Kanye West to call his fans out in a song. While it\u2019s nowhere near the read Rihanna is going to give the Navy when her album finally comes out, Kanye acknowledges Yandhi\u2019s disappearance and makes it clear that Jesus threw that out with the bathwater. Kanye only makes gospel music now.\n\n\u201cClosed on Sunday\u201d\n\nClosed on Sunday / You my Chick-fil-A / You\u2019re my number one / With the lemonade\n\n[*Genius lyrics annotation mode*] Chick-fil-A is an American fast-food establishment, famous for its Christian roots, polite employees, and being closed on Sunday as a testament to their faith. In 2017, they donated about $1.8 million to anti-LGBTQ organizations. In this lyric, it seems Kanye is ordering a Classic Chicken Sandwich combo, substituting lemonade for the sweet tea. He does not specify which side order he\u2019d like.\n\nNo more living for the culture, we nobody\u2019s slave\n\nThe irony of being anti-culture while actively creating culture. Weird flex, but okay.\n\n\u201cOn God\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why I charge the prices that I charge / I can\u2019t be out here Dancing With the Stars\n\nKanye said if you\u2019re even on the cusp of the B-list, don\u2019t talk to him! But something tells me he would take a meeting with Sean Spicer anyway.\n\nThirteenth amendment, gotta end it, that\u2019s on me\n\nA 2019 Kanye lyric that wouldn\u2019t make sense to 2004 us. Last year, Kanye actually tweeted then walked back this statement on TMZ, saying that he doesn\u2019t think we need to abolish the 13th amendment to the Constitution (which, FYI, prohibits enslavement except as punishment for a crime). Instead, we should \u201camend\u201d it. One too many syllables?\n\n\u201cEverything We Need\u201d\n\nWhat if Eve made apple juice? / You gon\u2019 do what Adam do?\n\nYou\u2019re saying there is nothing in this garden and Eve somehow made pressed juice? Who would say no to that?\n\n\u201cFollow God\u201d\n\nRiding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike\n\nExcitebike is an old NES video game that no one else is thinking about in 2019 except Kanye West.\n\nI was looking at the \u2018Gram and I don\u2019t even like likes\n\nHow else can you keep up with the Kardashians?", "description": "Here are some of the breakout lyrics from Kanye West\u2019s new album \u2018Jesus Is King,\u2019 out now.
