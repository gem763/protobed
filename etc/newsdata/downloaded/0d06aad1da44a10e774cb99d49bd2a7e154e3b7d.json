Well, unless you get busted for running an illegal underground fight club at a retirement home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, then by all means let's talk about that. On Friday morning, Fox 8 reported that three women were apprehended by authorities after police received reports that workers were allowing and encouraging elderly residents to fight each other.\n\nAccording to Fox 8, \"In June, police received a report of elder abuse at the Danby House assisted living facility. Workers were accused of letting residents fight each other.\" \"Marilyn Latish McKey, 32, Tonacia Yvonne Tyson, 20, and Taneshia Deshawn Jordan, 26,\" were arrested by police.\n\nThe nursing home, The Danby House, issued a statement condemning their employees' actions:\n\nDanby House has a zero-tolerance policy for the mistreatment of those in our care and as such, McKey, Tyson, and Jordan were terminated immediately in June when community management was alerted to this situation. Administrators have been working closely with the Winston-Salem Police Department throughout its investigation to ensure justice is served. Additional staff training and a more rigorous vetting process has been implemented for all new and existing employees at Danby House has been implemented to ensure the high standard of resident care that this community is known for continues.\n\nThe concept of \"fight clubs\" became popularized, and even somewhat glamorized, after the 1990 cult film classic by the same name starring Brad Pitt and Ed Norton as fighters and organizers of an underground club dedicated to fighting and breaking down society.\n\nHowever, this fight club at The Danby Home sounds absolutely horrible. According to Fox 8, \"McKey was charged with two counts of assault on an individual with a disability. Tyson and Jordan were charged with one count each of assault on an individual with a disability.\"", "description": ".10/11/2019 20:11:15PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/284/64823b4d-afed-4f26-9c34-ea6db868b01b.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
