It occurs when the amoeba enters the body through the nose, which may happen while swimming or diving in warm freshwater. It then travels through the nose and to the brain, where it destroys brain tissue.\n\nThe chances of contracting a brain-eating amoeba in the U.S. remain rare. Between 2009 and 2018, the CDC tracked 34 infections in people nationwide. However, the fatality rate remains at over 87 percent, with only four people surviving out of the 145 individuals in the U.S. ever reported to have contracted the amoeba.\n\nThe family had been hopeful that an antimicrobial medication called miltefosine would rid her of the amoeba, but on Monday, one of her aunts revealed in a Facebook post that she had died.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWords can not begin to express how overwhelming this past week has been for our family,\u201d Wendy Scott posted, in part. \u201cWe have been flooded by your love and support and feel incredibly humbled by how many lives have been impacted by our sweet and sassy, Lily Mae.
