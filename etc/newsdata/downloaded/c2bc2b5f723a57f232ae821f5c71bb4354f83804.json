(Nearmy/Getty Images)\n\nBoth Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton and Attorney General Christian Porter have indicated in radio interviews they are not overly pleased with the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) legalising personal possession of cannabis on Thursday.\n\nThe ACT Legislative Assembly passed a bill legalising the possession of up to 50 grams of cannabis for personal use.\n\nThe new Canberra law conflicts with Commonwealth drug legislation, and the federal government could feasibly strike it out if they so desired.\n\nThere\u2019s possible bad news on the horizon for the Canberrans thrilled by the notion of their city becoming the weed capital of Australia.\n\nHome Affairs Minister Peter Dutton and Attorney General Christian Porter have been doing the radio rounds this morning, and their attitude toward the ACT legislature\u2019s decision to legalise personal possession of cannabis is\u2026 not particularly positive.\n\nAppearing on 6PR, the attorney general said that he intends to \u201chave a look\u201d at the new legislation, and claimed he had not even had the chance to evaluate the legislation itself.\n\n\u201cI think this is, personally, a very bad idea,\u201d Porter told host Gareth Parker.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, they have a parliament, we\u2019ll have a look at their legislation and reserve our position.\u201d\n\nHe reminded listeners in Canberra who might be inclined to \u201cpossess cannabis\u201d \u2013 his words \u2013 that it is still illegal under Commonwealth law, and he fully expects police to enforce said laws.\n\n\u201cMy expectation would be that to the extent that a low of the Commonwealth is a valid law and applies, that it is enforced like any other law of the Commonwealth.\n\n\u201cThe expectation is that Commonwealth laws are enforced.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general went on to reiterate the new legislation is \u201ccrazy\u201d and a \u201cdumb idea\u201d, while not making any specific commitment to overrule the territory legislation beyond his earlier promise to \u201clook at\u201d the bill.\n\nThe home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, was far less circumspect, confirming he is fully \u201copposed to the law\u201d.\n\n\u201cI really do think it\u2019s a bad move,\u201d Dutton said in an interview with 2GB. \u201cI just think it\u2019s unconscionable.\n\n\u201cI think it might be trendy for the ACT government to go down this path, and they\u2019ll say they\u2019re enlightened and progressive and all the rest of it,\u201d Dutton said.\n\n\u201cBut I think it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n\nDutton confirmed that the attorney general was \u201chaving a look at\u201d the laws at the moment to decide how to proceed.\n\nAs Business Insider Australia reported on Wednesday, there is now a clash between Commonwealth and territory law on cannabis possession.\n\nThe ACT is no stranger to passing laws which are then struck out by the federal government. In 2013, the territory passed legislation legalising same-sex marriage \u2013 leading numerous couples to hurriedly get married before the federal government invalidated the law.\n\nIf the attorney general deigns to do so, he could strike out the cannabis possession law too. It\u2019s a decision the stoners of Canberra will no doubt be waiting on with bated breath.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
