But, be careful: his disciples, not our own.\u201d\n\nAs he has done repeatedly, Francis distinguished between \u201chard sell\u201d proselytizing and bearing humble witness to the Good News of Jesus Christ.\n\n\u201cThe Church proclaims the Gospel well only if she lives the life of a disciple. And a disciple follows the Master daily and shares the joy of discipleship with others,\u201d he said. \u201cNot by conquering, mandating, proselytizing, but by witnessing, humbling oneself alongside other disciples and offering with love the love that we ourselves received.\u201d\n\nTying the missionary mandate to his constant calls to an ecological \u201cconversion,\u201d the pontiff compared the gospel message to fresh air.\n\n\u201cThis is our mission: to give pure and fresh air to those immersed in the pollution of our world; to bring to earth that peace which fills us with joy whenever we meet Jesus on the mountain in prayer; to show by our lives, and perhaps even by our words, that God loves everyone and never tires of anyone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEach of us has and is a mission on this earth,\u201d Francis said. \u201cWe are here to witness, bless, console, raise up, and radiate the beauty of Jesus. Have courage!\u201d\n\nThe pope also suggested that Jesus\u2019 command to make disciples of all the nations underscores the universality of the Christian message as well as its inclusiveness.\n\n\u201cThe Lord is deliberate in repeating the word all,\u201d Francis said. \u201cHe knows that we are always using the words \u2018my\u2019 and \u2018our\u2019: my things, our people, our community\u2026 But he constantly uses the word all. All, because no one is excluded from his heart, from his salvation; all, so that our heart can go beyond human boundaries and particularism based on a self-centeredness that displeases God.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo and show love to everyone, because your life is a precious mission: it is not a burden to be borne, but a gift to offer. Have courage, and let us fearlessly go forth to all!\u201d he concluded.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Pope Francis said the task of Jesus\u2019 disciples is to give \u201cpure and fresh air to those immersed in the pollution of our world.\u201d", "authors": ["Thomas D.
