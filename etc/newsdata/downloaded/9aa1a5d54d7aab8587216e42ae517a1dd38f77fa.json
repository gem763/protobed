The $59 Defender series (shown above) is the company's flagship offering. With two parts \u2014 a hard-plastic inner shell and an exterior rubber cover \u2014 your Note 10 will likely survive any drop.\n\nFor $49.95, Otterbox also offers the Symmetry series, a thinner one-part case with more color options. You won't get quite as much drop-protection as you would with a two-part case like the Defender series, but it looks nicer and is a bit easier to slip on and off.\n\nFinally, for $39.95, you can try the Commuter Series, a thin, pared-down version of the Defender.\n\nPros: Durable, comes with a holster, several style and color options\n\nCons: Bulky, some are a pain to take on and off, expensive", "description": "Samsung's Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10 Plus are pricey phones \u2014 so make sure they're safe.
