A moment. Something defined. Finite. 31 October. Brexit Day. This is important because if Brexit is an event, it means people can see an end, a light at the end of the tunnel, a return to normality.\n\nYet the truth is very different. As Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage, Michael Gove and others know full well.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBrexit is not an event. It is a process. And the tunnel is long. With no light in sight.\n\nBrexit has been poisoning our politics, our economy and our relationships for the last three years. Businesses relocating to France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands is a part of Brexit. The collapse in inward investment is Brexit. The hike in weekly family food bills is Brexit. The hormone replacement therapy (HRT) shortage is Brexit. Johnson\u2019s attempt to suspend our parliament as the world looks on in astonishment is Brexit.\n\nAll of this is Brexit.\n\nAnd it is just the beginning.\n\nThink about it. The EU has been woven by successive governments into decisions relating to our laws, our borders, our security and our economy for the last 45 years. Clearly the process of leaving is going to be a little more difficult than changing banks.\n\nBut this \u2013 the truth \u2013 doesn\u2019t suit Johnson or Farage. Their leap-before-you-look political machismo means we must not ask too many questions before it is too late. Like dodgy used-car salesmen, they are masters of the small print. Sign on the dotted line, give us your bank details, drive away the car but of course, there is no refund when the wheels come off...\n\nWhich leads to the second part of the Leave strategy being played out in government: simplicity.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Mull over that for a second. It is easier to get up and go somewhere else than to stay where you are. It\u2019s easier to move house than stay put.\n\n\u201cThe day after we vote to leave, we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want,\u2019\u2019 said Gove during the 2016 campaign. \u201cThe free trade agreement that we will have to do with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history,\u201d said Liam Fox in July 2017. \u201cThere are plenty of people who now think the cost of getting out would be virtually nil and the cost of staying in would be very high,\u201d said Johnson in March 2016. Yet the total spend for Brexit preparations has now topped \u00a36bn, with legal disputes over contracts for ghost ships.\n\nAnd the government machine is now part of the operation, with the \u00a3100m \u201cget ready for Brexit\u201d campaign, effectively breaching purdah rules. I am still awaiting a reply from Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, to my letter on this issue.\n\nThe truth is, no deal means no deals on anything. It would be the start of years \u2013 even decades \u2013 of negotiations from a position of total weakness. It would hike prices, hit incomes, kill jobs, weaken our national security and standing in the world. And it risks the hard-won peace in Northern Ireland.\n\nIt would be the start of years of politicians rocking up on the evening news pointing fingers at each other and Brussels whilst our housing crisis grows, our NHS suffers and the poorest are hit even harder. And as our country turns in on itself and attitudes harden, there is the risk people will turn on each other and divisions will grow.\n\nThe government knows which port it is sailing to, yet wants to present all winds as favourable. It is seeking no deal, and with it, a decade or more of Brexit hardship and anxiety for a country already on edge. This week showed the force of those headwinds as Johnson lost his first four votes, sacked 21 Tory MPs, saw his own brother quit his government and pushed Amber Rudd to quit the cabinet as well as giving up the Tory whip.\n\nWhat the country needs now is real leadership and we have seen that in the Commons this week. Politicians willing to put the national interest before party interest and set a new course to break the deadlock. MPs willing to communicate honestly these two truths: Brexit is a process, with years of painful ramifications to come; and Brexit is as hard as anything our country has faced in modern history.\n\nOur country needs more time. A short extension to rule out an extreme and dangerous no-deal Brexit and set a new course based on three Cs: clarity, because we now know so much more than three years ago; closure through a new and binding people\u2019s vote with a defined Brexit or the option to remain; and coming together to rebuild relationships after years of painful politics and division.\n\nMary Creagh is Labour MP for Wakefield and is chair of the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee", "description": "It should be no surprise with Dominic Cummings at the heart of government that two key elements of the Leave strategy are still in play.", "authors": ["Mary Creagh"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/07/23/rudd-johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
