While the project looked good on paper, he feared it could cause embarrassment.\n\nThe department was then requested to draw up another agreement.\n\nThe new agreement was based on the advice that they should complete the project before handing it over to the beneficiaries.\n\nNo mention of Paras was made in this agreement.\n\nZondo expressed concern that the agreement was only between Estina and the department, despite Thabethe's understanding that a bulk of the funding for the project would come from Paras, through Estina.\n\nThe deputy chief justice added that nothing was done to prevent Paras from running away with millions that belonged to the government and there was recourse in this regard.\n\nOn the issue of who would implement the project, Thabethe said the first contract brought in the beneficiaries from the beginning, and he felt that this was the right way to do it. However, he relinquished this position once he received the legal advice that the contract was illegal.\n\n\n\nHe added that it was always their intention to hand over the project to the beneficiaries, including five cows to each, but this encountered problems within the first year and they were not able to get to that point.\n\nGcabashe pointed out that, to date, beneficiaries have not been involved in the project as originally intended.\n\nShe further brought in evidence from Vrede businessman, Willie Basson, who said \"ribs of the cattle were already showing\" and \"dead cattle was lying around\" as a result of Estina project manager Chandra Prasad's lack of knowledge in rearing cattle and Estina's failure to do the work.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
