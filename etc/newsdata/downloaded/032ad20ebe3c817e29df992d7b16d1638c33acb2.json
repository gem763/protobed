But the fluctuations caused a big challenge.\n\n\"The so-called duck curve is really causing security issues for the distribution networks,'' she said.Dr Schott said Australia's power grid was simply not structured right to cope with the rapid change in technology and shifting markets.\n\n\"We've got a grid at the moment that's not fit for purpose,'' she said.\n\nPart of the problem was that large renewable energy projects such as solar farms and wind turbines were in rural areas and there was a ''long, skinny string'' to connect those into the cities where the large populations were.\n\n\"That is really plaguing us at the moment''.\n\nTransitioning to a new modern network was a big challenge for Australia, but the country needed to be careful not to overbuild and build too fast, because those costs would find their way into customer's power bills.\n\nHigher bills was one of the reasons why many households decided to install solar panels.\"One of the reasons people have done it is because their bills went up,'' Dr Schott said.\n\nDr Schott also said that ageing coal-fired power stations like the Liddell plant in New South Wales weren't flexible enough to be part of the long-term future landscape.\n\n\"They are dinosaurs in that sense,'' she said.\"What we actually need in the market is energy that is both firm and flexible''.", "description": "Minister for Energy Angus Taylor backs coal, gas and hydro and blames 'ill directed subsidies' for renewable energy are distorting the grid.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2097%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_36%2C$y_16/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/64b2ef6a852da1fa202750815043083f77682b1f", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
