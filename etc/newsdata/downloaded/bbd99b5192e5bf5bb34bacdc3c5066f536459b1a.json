Recently, David Brooks called Warren\u2019s classic novel All the King\u2019s Men the greatest political novel ever written. \u201cThe prose is lush but not overdone,\u201d said Brooks. \u201cThe stance is elegiac, which is my favorite literary tone. It captures the intensity of politics but also the way the rush for electoral popularity sucks at the soul of the participants.\u201d Warren won his first Pulitzer prize for that novel in 1947, and he won twice more for his poetry. In 1979, Steve Oney captured the lion in winter for a long profile in The Atlanta Journal & Constitution Magazine, reprinted here with the author\u2019s permission.

Resting in a wicker chair on his front porch, Robert Penn Warren, sweat dripping from his sharp, freckled nose like a rivulet running off red rock, gazed into the hazy glimmer of late day. \u201cI think a man just dies,\u201d he said after a while. His voice was harsh and sibilant. \u201cNo heaven. No hell.\u201d Tugging a checkered bandanna from a rear pocket of his baggy Levis, he wiped the perspiration from his face. \u201cI\u2019m a naturalist,\u201d he added haltingly. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in God. But I want to find meaning in life. I refuse to believe it\u2019s merely a dreary sequence of events. So I write stories and poetry. My work is my testimony.\u201d Warren\u2019s tone had dropped into a low, croupy register. Limned briefly by the last beams of the sunset, he resembled a statue carved long ago from a hunk of sandstone. He reached for a drink, smiled then said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m talking like this. I can\u2019t tell someone why I write. And I\u2019m sure as hell not going to attempt self-psychoanalysis. But let me tell you a story \u2026\u201d", "description": "Robert Penn Warren made winning Pulitzer prizes look like a habit.
