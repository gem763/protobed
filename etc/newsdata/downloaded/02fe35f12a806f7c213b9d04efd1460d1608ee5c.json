James McGovern, Massachusetts Democrat, said any measure is going to take bipartisan support, as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s signature, and called on Senate Republicans to get moving.\n\n\u201cSo someone over there is going to have to deliver some bad news to Donald Trump \u2014 that he is going to have to log off Twitter and actually govern,\u201d Mr. McGovern said. \u201cIt may not make for good television, but keeping the government open for business is the most basic responsibility that we have.\u201d\n\nRep. Tom Cole, Oklahoma Republican, said the package isn\u2019t perfect but it represents a compromise both sides can support.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that even in this time of divided government that we can produce bipartisan legislation before Nov. 21st which reflects the priorities of the American people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe House legislation also extends the National Flood Insurance Program and the authorization for the Export-Import Bank through Nov. 21, as well as a number of health programs.\n\nOne sticking point had been how to address aid to farmers who might be hurting from Mr. Trump\u2019s trade battle with China.\n\nThe bill allows for continued aid, but it also requires the administration to report to Congress on the \u201ctrade damage\u201d caused by retaliatory tariffs and other factors.\n\nRep. Michael Conaway, the top Republican on the House Agriculture Committee, suggested that Democrats shouldn\u2019t be patting themselves on the back for pulling back from a \u201cthreat to do serious harm to rural America.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s akin to Texans thanking Santa Anna for making Texas a Republic,\u201d the Texas Republican said. \u201cThe good news is the Democrats failed in their effort to use our hard-working farm and ranch families as pawns in their obsessive vendetta against the president.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer said it was his understanding that the Republican-controlled Senate intends to pass the bill.\n\nHe said there had been talk of extending funding through mid-December, which would give lawmakers more time to work out their differences on next year\u2019s annual funding bills.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason in God\u2019s green earth we cannot complete our business on the appropriations process by Nov. 21st,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said. \u201cI urge my friends in the Senate to not squander the extra time this [bill] provides \u2014 approximately seven working weeks.\u201d\n\nAcross the Capitol, there were some rumblings about bipartisanship Thursday, a day after Senate Democrats had blocked action on a package of House-passed spending bills.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell voiced his support for a measure that would add $250 million to help states administer and secure their elections in the run-up to the 2020 elections.\n\nMr. McConnell, who has been labeled \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d by Democrats and liberal commentators for, they say, blocking legislation to counter election interference by countries such as Russia, said the amount will bring the allocation for election security to more than $600 million since fiscal 2018.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crucial issue,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said. \u201cThe Trump administration has made enormous strides to help states secure their elections without giving Washington new power to push the states around.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee included the amendment as part of spending legislation the panel advanced Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis problem was not isolated to 2016 and we cannot be complacent now,\u201d said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, the top Democrat on the panel. \u201cThese funds are critical to our national security.\u201d\n\nBoth parties signed off on a two-year budget deal this summer that allows Congress to spend about $320 billion more than what had been allowed under law, but lawmakers still need to pass bills that appropriate those funds for fiscal 2020, which starts Oct. 1.\n\nDemocrats have objected to additional funding for Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall, saying Republicans shouldn\u2019t be going along with the president\u2019s move to invoke emergency powers and transfer about $3.6 billion from Pentagon funds to the wall.\n\nRepublicans, though, say the budget deal included restrictions on blocking the president from making transfers and that the wall is vital for border security.\n\nA standoff over border wall funding helped trigger the 35-day shutdown that stretched from December 2018 into January.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
