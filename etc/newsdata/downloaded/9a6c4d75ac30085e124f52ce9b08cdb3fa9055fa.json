Let's put your knowledge to the test!\n\nHow much do you know about your vagina? ~ Charles ???? on Unsplash\n\nHave you got the low-down on your vagina? It\u2019s been a while since we were in awks-inducing sex ed classes labelling Fallopian tubes. But even as adults in 2019, we could all stand to learn more about our vaginas.\n\nLuckily, it seems they\u2019re quite the hot topic right now. Athletes, such as Chinese swimmer Fu Yuanhui and fitness guru Kayla ltsines, are candid about how periods affect their performance, while celebs share everything from vagina-steaming pics (Chrissy Teigen, we\u2019re looking at you \u2014 doctors advise against it, BTW) to stories of endometriosis. Heck, singer Janelle Mon\u00e1e even wears vulva-shaped trousers in her music video for Pynk. And we\u2019re 100 percent here for it.\n\nSo, in the spirit of myth-busting, behold the trivia you never knew you needed to know about your vagina et al. Class is officially in session.\n\n1. What actually counts as the vagina?\n\nA . The stretchy, muscular passageway from the vulva to the cervix.\n\n. The stretchy, muscular passageway from the vulva to the cervix. B. Everything going on down there.\n\nEverything going on down there. C. The lips outside the genitals.\n\nANSWER: A.\n\nHigh-10 if you got this one right: a British survey by The Eve Appeal found 44 percent of women couldn\u2019t point out the vagina on a diagram of the reproductive tract. \u201cPeople often get mixed up with their vagina and their vulva,\u201d says family-planning specialist Dr Deborah Bateson.\n\nSo, how can you tell them apart? Think of the vagina as the stretchy, muscular internal passageway from the opening of the vagina to the cervix at the top, which leads to the uterus. Whereas the vulva is the outside part of your genitals, including the inner and outer lips (labia), the clitoris, urethral opening (for pee) and vaginal opening.

How long is the average clitoris?\n\nA. 1 to 2cm\n\n1 to 2cm B. 5 to 6cm\n\n5 to 6cm C. 9 to 11cm\n\nANSWER: C.\n\nYep, you\u2019re packing down there. The pea-sized part you can see (named the head or glans) is just the tip of the iceberg \u2013 a tip that contains 8 000 nerve endings (double the amount in the penis, not that it\u2019s a competition). \u201cThe clitoris is a large organ hidden beneath the surface, with four legs and a long neck,\u201d explains Dr Nina Brochmann, co-author of The Wonder Down Under: A User\u2019s Guide To The Vagina. \u201cIt can measure up to 11cm within the body, surrounding your genitals.\u201d\n\n3. Your body needs a break from hormonal contraception.\n\nA. True\n\nTrue B. False\n\nANSWER: B.\n\nA US survey of almost 900 young women published in the journal Women\u2019s Health Issues (no relation) found that more than half thought they should hit pause on their contraception to stay healthy. But unless you\u2019re trying to get pregnant, there\u2019s no need, says Bateson. \u201cIf you\u2019ve found a pill that works for you, there are no health benefits in stopping.\u201d In fact, stopping and starting may cause unwanted side effects because of the fluctuations in the reproductive hormones.\n\nBetter to do your research first. \u201cA growing number of women would rather have something more natural \u2013 either lower doses of hormones or no hormones at all, so it\u2019s important to be aware of your options,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you do want to switch, make sure you\u2019re aware of the need to take other precautions if you don\u2019t want to become pregnant right now.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Can Your Vagina Be Too Tight For Sex?\n\n4. Lady Boners: The Real Deal?\n\nA. Legit.\n\nLegit. B. Surely not.\n\nANSWER: A.\n\nYour clitoris is made of the same erectile tissue as the penis, meaning you too can get it up \u2013 and get it up you do. \u201cWomen have up to eight \u2018boners\u2019 a night,\u201d says Brochmann. \u201cIn fact, there\u2019s little anatomical or physiological difference between female and male sexual arousal \u2013 you also have a sexual organ that is erect and responds in the same way as the penis.\u201d The female version of nocturnal arousal goes by the not-so-sexy name \u201cnocturnal clitoris tumescence\u201d and it explains why you might prefer sex in the morning. Rise and shine indeed.\n\n5. How many women will get thrush at some point?\n\nA. 35%\n\n35% B. 75%\n\n75% C. 95%\n\nANSWER: B.\n\nThree quarters of women will experience the fungal infection at least once in their life, according to healthcare company Bupa, along with the symptoms (itching, burning and general discomfort) it can trigger.\n\nThrush is mostly harmless, but this doesn\u2019t mean you should swerve the GP visit. \u201cIt\u2019s common for women to self-diagnose thrush and other female health problems when it might be something else. So it\u2019s important to go to your doctor and get checked out, even if there are over-the-counter products available,\u201d says Brochmann.\n\nAs for those home remedies you found on an online forum? Ja\u2026 No. \u201cMost are a waste of time and resources,\u201d she advises, citing yoghurt and cranberry juice on the safe-but-basically-pointless list.\n\nAnd ditch douching at all costs, which upsets the pH balance of your vagina. \u201cThat can lead to all sorts of problems, such as bacterial vaginosis,\u201d adds Bateson. If you do have recurring thrush, opt for loose clothing to keep the area dry, wear cotton undies and avoid panty liners to ease the itch.\n\n6. What\u2019s the function of the female orgasm?\n\nA. To promote both loyalty and bonding between sexual partners.\n\nTo promote both loyalty and bonding between sexual partners. B. The muscle contractions help suck sperm up to the ovaries.\n\nThe muscle contractions help suck sperm up to the ovaries. C. Experts don\u2019t actually know \u2013 it\u2019s probably useless.\n\nANSWER: C.\n\nFemale orgasms are still a mystery and although all of the above have been theorised at some point, the general consensus among experts is that the big O doesn\u2019t do all that much. According to Brochmann, female orgasms are just a (really) fun bonus of male and female anatomy starting from the same point as foetuses develop in the uterus. Essentially, while men\u2019s orgasms function to deliver sperm and fertilise eggs, we have orgasms simply because men do.\u201d It\u2019s just a great evolutionary by-product,\u201d she says. We couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\nREAD MORE: 5 Causes Of Abnormal Vaginal Odour Every Woman Should Know About\n\n7. The future of your vaginal health is bright, thanks mainly to\u2026\n\nA. Social media.\n\nSocial media. B. Femtech.\n\nFemtech. C. Europe.\n\nANSWER: B.\n\nObvs. Female technology, otherwise known as femtech, is a completely new \u2013 and welcome \u2013 category in healthcare, with the market predicted to be worth R749 billion by 2025. Categorised as tech developments primarily focused on women\u2019s health issues \u2013 including pregnancy, fertility, gynaecological conditions and the menstrual cycle \u2013 this can only be a good thing for your vagina.\n\nIronically, one of the industry\u2019s strongest areas is focused on weakness, namely that of your pelvic floor, a group of hammock-like muscles that support your organs and ensure you only wee when you choose to. Vaginal trainers, such as Elvie, go inside your vagina and send signals to their respective apps to measure the strength of your pelvic floor and show how well you do your Kegel exercises.\n\nViveve, a US company, has led clinical trials to prove the efficacy of its treatment for female sexual dysfunction, which uses a device to deliver a patented cryogen-cooled radio frequency to renew tissue and maximise blood flow in the vaginal canal.\n\nThen there\u2019s Ohnut, a Kickstarter-funded product for the 75 percent of women who have experienced pain during sex, whether because of conditions like endometriosis, after childbirth or due to muscle spasms. Made of stackable silicone rings, you pop it on a partner\u2019s penis or insertable toy, letting you choose a depth that feels good for you.
