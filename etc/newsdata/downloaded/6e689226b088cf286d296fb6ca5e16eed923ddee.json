The Finance Ministry said it collected 11.9 trillion won in corporate taxes in August, a drop of 600 billion won from the previous year, due to broader weakness in business performance during the first half of the year.BY CHAE YUN-HWAN [chae.yunhwan@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
