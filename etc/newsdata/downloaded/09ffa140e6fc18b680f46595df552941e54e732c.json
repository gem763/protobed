REUTERS/Aly Song/Files\n\n5G networks are at the centre of a brewing technology war between United States and China, as they are expected to host critical functions from driverless vehicles to smart electric grids and military communications, underscoring their importance to national security.\n\nWashington has put Chinese supplier Huawei on a trade blacklist and led a worldwide campaign to persuade allies to ban the firm from their 5G networks, alleging its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying - which Huawei has repeatedly denied.\n\nSweden\u2019s Ericsson, which together with Finland\u2019s Nokia and Huawei sells the bulk of radio access network equipment that is key for 5G mobile services, said it was now targeting sales of 230-240 billion Swedish crowns ($23.5-24.5 billion) in 2020, up from 210-220 billion previously.\n\n\u201cWe see a much faster pace of introduction of 5G than expected,\u201d Ericsson CEO Borje Ekholm told a conference call, citing particular strength in the United States and South Korea.\n\n\u201cShould we have expected this? To some extent we should have, but the reality is it\u2019s happening even faster than we expected just a few months ago\u201d.\n\nEricsson shares jumped as much as 7.4% to a three month high of 89.94 crowns, pulling up Nokia\u2019s shares in their wake.\n\nThe Swedish company\u2019s adjusted third-quarter operating earnings rose to 6.5 billion crowns from 3.8 billion a year earlier, corresponding to an 11.4% margin and beating the 5.2 billion mean forecast seen in a Refinitiv poll of analysts.\n\nStill, Ericsson kept its target for an operating margin of more than 10% for 2020, citing short-term pressure from some contracts and higher initial costs for new 5G products.\n\nThe company said it expected 5G deployments in China, where it has invested to gain market share, to start \u201cnear term\u201d, adding they were likely to have \u201cchallenging margins\u201d initially.\n\nIt changed its 2022 margin target to 12-14% from more than 12% previously.\n\nTARGETS CONSERVATIVE\n\nActivist investor Cevian Capital, Ericsson\u2019s largest owner by shares and third largest by votes, said the targets were conservative and the company could deliver more.\n\n\u201cBorje (Ekholm) continues to set targets at a level where it\u2019s basically impossible not to exceed them\u201d, Cevian managing partner Christer Gardell told Reuters.\n\nEricsson said it now expected the Radio Access Network (RAN) equipment market to grow by 5% in 2019, up from July\u2019s forecast for 3% growth.\n\nEricsson shares were up 6.7% at 0840 GMT, the biggest rise by a European blue-chip stock. But they are still down 1% since the firm\u2019s second-quarter results in July, when it warned costs related to winning new contracts for its network business would likely hit profit margins in the second half of the year.\n\nCredit Suisse said in a research note that Ericsson\u2019s third-quarter results were \u201cbetter on all metrics\u201d, while Carnegie said the update was \u201cvery strong\u201d.\n\nWhile some analysts are expecting Ericsson to benefit from Huawei\u2019s problems, Ekholm said the firm had still not seen any impact on sales from the turmoil surrounding its rival, which had instead made some customers more cautious about investing.\n\n\u201cWhat it has created is uncertainty in the market and perhaps a certain worry amongst equipment suppliers,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cSo if we see anything, it\u2019s some short-term headwind rather than something positive\u201d.", "description": "Telecoms equipment maker Ericsson beat quarterly earnings expectations on Thursday and lifted its market forecast for this year and its sales target for 2020, saying demand for superfast 5G networks was taking off more quickly than expected.", "authors": ["Johannes Hellstrom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441745022&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0A2", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
