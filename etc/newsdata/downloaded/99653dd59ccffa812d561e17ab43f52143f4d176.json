In the end, he did neither and the ball rolled harmlessly out of play.\n\nWith that, the referee blew for half-time. Boos rang out from the home fans, Dele Alli hoofed the ball into the stands and Mauricio Pochettino called time on his latest throw of the dice.\n\nIf Abdoulaye Doucoure's early goal was the difference on the scoreboard, it was a litany of such basic errors that proved Tottenham's undoing until Gazzaniga's opposite number presented them with a gift \u2013 and some respite for now.\n\nAbdoulaye Doucoure's early goal for Watford meant Tottenham had a tough afternoon\n\nFollowing defeat by Brighton, Pochettino made seven changes on Saturday. For the first time in the league this season, he also changed to a back three in search of a winning formula.\n\nThere was no Erik Lamela, no Heung-min Son, and no record-signing Tanguy Ndombele in the starting line-up. There was no place at all for the injured Christian Eriksen or Hugo Lloris, either.\n\nAnd for much of the game, there was no pace, precision or purpose about Tottenham's play.\n\nIn the first half, in particular, they were ponderous, allowing Watford to sit deep, starve the space and pounce on the break whenever Tottenham gave up possession \u2013 as they so often did. Pochettino paced along his technical area, throwing his hands into the air to urge his side on.\n\nBut his side had little by way of a response. Nothing the boss tries these days is bringing much joy.\n\nAlli, once again, did very little at all, while Harry Kane cut an increasingly frustrated figure.\n\n'How s*** must you be, we're winning away,' the Watford fans sung. Make no mistake, Spurs are deep in the brown stuff.\n\nThe visitors have now failed to win any of their nine opening Premier League games this season.\n\nBut here the bottom side were allowed to enjoy themselves, Ben Foster typifying their new-found confidence with a neat Cruyff turn inside his own area to send Alli down a blind alley.\n\nTottenham's draw with Watford piles the pressure on manager Mauricio Pochettino and his staff following a string of disappointing results\n\nPride that was to come before a fall. The introduction of Son at half-time saw the end of the back-three experiment. It was also the catalyst for an instant change in the mood and pace of the game.\n\nSuddenly Spurs had threat in behind, suddenly Watford weren't being afforded the time to settle.\n\nBut the bounce didn't last for long. Though Ndombele and Lamela came on, Gazzaniga fluffed two more kicks and Spurs were quickly running out of time.\n\nThey pushed and pushed, sending cross after cross towards Foster's goal. Nothing would stick, mind.\n\nUntil Foster clattered Kiko Femenia and Alli was allowed to rescue his side.\n\nStill there was still a smattering of boos at full-time, though.
