The term is a Latin phrase for a favor granted explicitly in return for something else.\n\n(Despite the testimony being held in private, outlets including CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post obtained his full opening statement.)\n\nHe said that Gordon Sondland \u2013 the hotel magnate and GOP donor Trump appointed as EU ambassador \u2013 told him that \u201c\u2018everything was dependent\u201d on Ukraine announcing a Biden probe, \u201cincluding security assistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular, informal channel of US, policy-making and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons,\u201d he told lawmakers.\n\nUp to that point, top Republicans had mostly stuck to the line that no compelling evidence of a quid pro quo arrangement had emerged \u2013 and that there are therefore no grounds for impeaching the president.\n\nAs recently as Saturday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the president\u2019s key congressional allies, told Vox News that he had not seen any evidence so far to prove the claim.\n\ncaption President Donald Trump\u2019s approach to Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance has put him at odds with some of his top allies in the Senate. source Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\n\u201cIf you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing,\u201d he said \u2013 the implication being that he had not yet seen any proof.\n\nThe White House briefly appeared to admit a quid pro quo itself.\n\nIn a stunning press conference last week, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney described a quid pro quo deal, but hastily retracted the comments, blaming the media for misconstruing him.\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony has made it even more difficult for Republicans to maintain the \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d line of defense, and strengthened the hand of Democrats.\n\nDemocratic Rep. and House intelligence committee member Debbie Wasserman described it as \u201cthe most damning testimony I\u2019ve heard.\u201d\n\nSo what next for Republicans seeking to win the battle for public opinion as the House Democrats\u2019 case for impeaching Trump grows stronger?\n\nAccording to multiple reports, the White House has not formed a \u201cwar room\u201d to coordinate the party\u2019s response to the inquiry, leaving efforts to hit back at Democrats conducting the probe in disarray even before Taylor\u2019s testimony.\n\nThe situation had gotten so bad that, according to Politico, Steve Bannon- the former chief strategist who left the White House on acrimonious terms \u2013 is launching a podcast which he wants to act as an informal war room for the Republican defense against impeachment.\n\nWriting in The Washington Post, correspondent Dan Balz spelled out some of the routes that Republicans might take after Taylor laid bare the shadow foreign policy waged by White House surrogates in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWill they conclude that what the president did was legitimate? Will they attempt to point in other directions? Will they argue that what Trump did wasn\u2019t right but isn\u2019t impeachable? There\u2019s less room for equivocation about what happened today than there was before,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe White House\u2019s immediate response was to attack Taylor\u2019s credibility, as seen by press secretary Stephanie Grisham accusing him of partisan bias, echoing White House attacks on the officials who conducted the Mueller probe.\n\n\u201cThis is a co-ordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution,\u201d Grisham said.\n\nTrump himself in a tweet early wednesday quoted GOP Rep. John Ratcliffe, who in an appearance in Fox and Friends argued that because Ukraine was not ware of the deal offered by Trump, a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d never existed. In fact, Taylor did discuss in testimony Tuesday that the Ukrainian government was aware of the arrangement Trump was trying to broker \u2013 and that Sondland told Ukraine\u2019s president that if he did not publicly announce a Biden probe on CNN, US-Ukrainian relations would be at \u201cstalemate,\u201d in what Taylor understood to be a reference to military aid being frozen.\n\nNeither he (Taylor) or any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. You can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo.\u201d Congressman John Ratcliffe @foxandfriends Where is the Whistleblower? The Do Nothing Dems case is DEAD! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2019\n\nAnd in what is likely to cause further concern for the White House, a Reuters/Ipsos poll \u2013 taken before Taylor\u2019s testimony \u2013 shows support among independent voters for impeaching Trump soaring.\n\nBut there was also a clue in the poll showing cause for optimism for Trump.\n\nDespite the official White House line of defense to impeachment being in tatters, Trump still has good reason to believe that Republicans will find a new argument in favor of acquitting him in a prospective Senate impeachment trial.\n\nAccording to the survey, almost three quarters of Republicans approve of Trump\u2019s handling of foreign policy.\n\nThis is down from the last survey, but the high levels of support from the party\u2019s grassroots will likely deter Republicans considering abandoning their defense of the president altogether.", "description": "Business Insider - Testimony to Congress by the US' top diplomat in Ukraine has made it much more difficult for Republicans defending the president..
