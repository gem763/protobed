Here's how!\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nLast week, my wife and I celebrated our fifth wedding anniversary.\n\nOn the way home from work, I stopped at a local flower shop to get her flowers. As they wrapped my flowers, I paid with a credit card using the shop's Square card reader.\n\nFour days later, I got this email from the flower shop:\n\nI hadn't given the flower shop my email \u2014 I was in and out in less than five minutes.\n\nHow in the world did Mrs. Blooms at Fulton Center get my email address and send me this spam? Through Square, it turns out.\n\n\"Only a Square Seller that you have directly provided your email address to has access to that personal information. Often this occurs the first time you enter your email address to receive a receipt,\" Square's FAQ says. In the case of these flowers, I hadn't given my email address for the receipt. But since I gave my email for a receipt at some Square-using store in the past, Square used it to send me marketing from subsequent retail outlets.\n\nRead more: The wild life of billionaire Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who eats one meal a day, dates models, and loves bitcoin\n\n\"You may receive marketing email (facilitated by Square) from other Square Sellers you have shopped at,\" the FAQ says. \"Square doesn't share your contact information with sellers who you have not directly given it to. If you're receiving a marketing email via Square from a seller who you didn't provide your email to, they do not have access to view your email address and can only market to you via Square Marketing.\"\n\nSo: Because I entered my email address to receive a receipt once, Square kept my email on file and used it to send me spam from other retailers. Great!\n\nMrs. Blooms was just the latest local retailer that uses Square for its point-of-sale to send me spam, and they didn't even need my email address.\n\nBlue Bottle, where I sometimes buy fancy coffee, has also started sending me spam emails. I went to Rhode Island for a wedding a few weeks ago, and I bought coffee one morning at a shop in Providence \u2014 they've also started sending me emails.\n\nAnd all these emails originate from the same sender: \"messages@squaremktg.com.\"\n\nThankfully, there's a really easy way to stop these emails altogether.\n\nThe next time you get one, or if you still have one in your inbox, scroll to the bottom and look for this link:\n\nOnce you click through, Square has a very simple toggle that allows you to easily opt out \u2014 for some bizarre reason, it's automatically set to \"Receive emails from the merchants I frequent.\"\n\nWhen you click through, you'll see this:\n\nAll you need to do from there is to select \"I do not want to receive emails from any merchants,\" and you should be all set.\n\nYou could, of course, add the \"messages@squaremktg.com\" email address to your spam filter if you want to be all the way through. By all means, you do you, but I've yet to receive a single email since toggling the option to stop receiving all emails.", "description": "If you've ever used a credit or debit card to pay at a store that uses Square, you've probably gotten a lot of spam emails.
