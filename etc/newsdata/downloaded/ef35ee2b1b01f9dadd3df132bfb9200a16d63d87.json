A key interest rate the Fed aims to influence also broke above the central bank\u2019s target range on Tuesday for the first time since the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened in the repo market is far from a minor problem,\u201d said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist for Jefferies. \u201cThat\u2019s a financial crisis waiting to happen if they don\u2019t get that under control.\u201d\n\nAs the head of the New York Fed, Williams has the unique task of overseeing regulation of Wall Street and execution of monetary policy. The 57-year-old veteran economist, who was previously president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, has a resume that diverges from some of his predecessors who came to the job with years in the financial sector.\n\nSome investors and economists who regularly interact with the New York Fed said Williams and his staff could have better prepared for the factors that likely led to this week\u2019s liquidity crunch, which included larger-than-expected issuance of Treasury bonds and a surge in quarterly corporate tax payments.\n\nThe bank took no action on Monday when the repo rate first increased and faced technical problems on Tuesday that delayed the repo operation by half an hour.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell defended the central bank\u2019s response to the liquidity crunch on Wednesday, saying officials saw the cash shortage coming and \u201ctook appropriate actions\u201d to address the issue.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see this as having any implications for the broader economy,\u201d Powell told reporters after the Fed announced at the close of a two-day policy meeting that it would reduce its benchmark overnight lending rate to a range of 1.75% to 2.00%. \u201cWe took appropriate actions to address those pressures and those measures were successful. If we experience another episode in money markets we have the tools to address those pressures.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the New York Fed declined to comment beyond Powell\u2019s remarks.\n\nMore information is needed to assess whether the moves are a sign of a broader problem, other investors said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing,\u201d said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist for Baird. \u201cBut there is a risk that there is some trouble in the monetary plumbing in the economy.\u201d\n\nComplicating matters is the recent departure of two key markets experts, leaving vacancies at the New York Fed that some worry may have slowed down the U.S. central bank\u2019s response to the volatility this week.\n\nThe two market-focused officials abruptly departed in June: Simon Potter, who oversaw the New York Fed\u2019s trading desk, and Richard Dzina, who ran the bank\u2019s financial services group. To date, neither has been replaced, leaving the central bank without permanent leadership in a key part of its operations.\n\nYELLEN SUCCESSOR\n\nWilliams has spent decades analysing, and in some cases, reshaping, monetary policy. In the early 1990s, as a Stanford University graduate student, he worked closely with influential economist John Taylor on a seminal paper that to this day remains a benchmark for rate-setting at the Fed.\n\nHe became an economist for the Federal Reserve in Washington in 1994, and in 2002 moved to the San Francisco Fed, rising through its ranks to lead the research department and then, in 2011, to head the bank after its president, Janet Yellen, became the Fed\u2019s No. 2 policymaker in Washington.\n\nBut the native of Sacramento, California, a Star Wars fan and a collector of sneakers, never worked at an investment bank or on a trading desk, unlike his predecessor at the New York Fed, William Dudley, who was a managing director at Goldman Sachs.\n\n\u201cHe will have to rely on the expertise of others to accomplish this central task,\u201d the Brookings Institution\u2019s Peter Conti-Brown wrote in a critical essay shortly after Williams was appointed to the New York Fed in 2018.\n\nJULY MISSTEP\n\nWilliams inadvertently roiled markets in July when investors interpreted his remarks on research about how the Fed should operate in a low-rate environment as a full-throated call for policy-makers to move quickly and aggressively.\n\nMarkets viewed his comments that central banks should act \u201cat the first sign of economic distress\u201d as a sign that the Fed would cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points. In an unusual move, the Fed issued a clarifying statement later that afternoon saying that Williams was speaking about 20 years of academic research, not sending a signal about future policy actions.\n\nThe New York Fed\u2019s evolving reactions this week show that Williams and his staff are responding to markets more quickly, said Tom Simons, a senior money market economist for Jefferies.\n\nWhile Tuesday\u2019s repo operation arrived a \u201clittle bit later than would have been ideal,\u201d the team responded in a more timely manner on Wednesday, Simons said.\n\nThe Fed was smart to announce late Tuesday that the move would be coming the following morning, a decision that was likely made after it became clear the effective funds rate was going to trade above the Fed\u2019s target range, Simons said. Traders took full advantage of the cash injection on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a vote of confidence that they do have the staff together to handle these sorts of things,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother repo operation is scheduled for Thursday morning.", "description": "Wild swings this week in U.S. money markets have raised fresh concerns about whether the New York Federal Reserve under John Williams has lost its deft touch with markets.", "authors": ["Jonnelle Marte", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431405093&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H244", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
