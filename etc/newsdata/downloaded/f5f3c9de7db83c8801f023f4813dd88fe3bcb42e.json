Marcus Rashford rifled in an early opener before Ross Barkley struck twice from Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane crosses. Sterling made it four before the break then grabbed his tenth in as many England games after half-time before Kane added further gloss.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThere was also no mention whatsoever of the events going on off the pitch during their live blog of the game. During the stoppages UEFA simply wrote: \"There is a break in play\" and \"Play has resumed\", with no further details about the nature of these pauses in play.\n\nUEFA announced after the match they would not be making a statement about the racism until Tuesday, as they come under mounting pressure to hit Bulgaria with a strong punishment.\n\nFA chairman Greg Clarke said after the game: \"I would like to see a very stringent review by UEFA, because I know they take racism very, very seriously,\" while anti-discrimination organisation Kick It Out added: \"There can be no more pitiful fines or short stadium bans. If UEFA care at all about tackling discrimination- and if the Equal Game campaign means anything- then points deductions and tournament expulsion must follow.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe FA released a statement which read: \"As we are sadly aware, this is not the first time our players have been subjected to this level of abuse and there is no place for this kind of behaviour in society, let alone in football.\n\n\"We will be asking UEFA to investigate as a matter of urgency.\"", "description": "The organisation, who are the administrative body for the European Championships, chose to ignore the taunts despite them overshadowing the football", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580566.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Racism-in-Bulgaria-vs-England-game.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
