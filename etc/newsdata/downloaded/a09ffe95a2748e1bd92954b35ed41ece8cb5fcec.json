In 2017, she lost a platform heel during the second half of Anna Sui\u2019s New York Fashion Week show.\n\nAt the time, the model continued strutting down the runway as if she still had the shoe on, impressively keeping her composure if nothing went wrong. It appeared one of her heels wasn\u2019t properly secured amid the backstage rush.\n\nAnd for the finale walk, Gigi held on to younger sister Bella Hadid, who closed the show, for extra support as she walked on the toes of her right foot with only a black sock on.\n\nView photos Gigi Hadid | JASON SZENES/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock More", "description": "Gigi Hadid Walks Runway Barefoot After Wardrobe Malfunction", "authors": ["Helen Murphy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pWlJskkc5H8OJSanmndA1g--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/4f43ded5a1a0fd1af6a8c3f79ec9ecaf", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
