Expecting lofty talk of revolution and systemic change, the Lords instead found that the community\u2019s needs were very straightforward. \u201cThis place is filthy, man. It stinks. There\u2019s garbage all over,\u201d was the complaint Mr. Maristany heard. Sanitation pickups were irregular, and piles of trash accumulated on street corners, fouling the air and presenting a significant health risk. Waste bins were nowhere to be found.\n\nA small contingent of Young Lords went to the local Department of Sanitation office to ask for better service. \u201cWe were na\u00efve,\u201d Mr. Maristany says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a mistake, the way they operate. They provide service to the powerful, the people with political clout, not to us!\u201d They asked for brooms and trash bags so they could do the cleanup themselves. \u201cThey threw us out!\u201d\n\nIn a 1995 article in The Village Voice, Pablo G\u00fazman , a founding member of the New York Young Lords, recalled the tenor of the situation. \u201cAll we had been trying to do after sweeping up the streets on previous Sundays was talk with Sanitation about once-a-week pickups and nonexistent trash cans, and about how to decently treat people asking for help instead of blowing them off,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAs Mr. Maristany tells it, the group eventually returned to the sanitation depot and took the cleanup equipment.\n\n\u201cWe thought Sanitation would come take the trash away once we\u2019d bagged it all up for them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had bags and bags and bags of trash. We said, \u2018You going to come clean this trash up now or what?\u2019 They refused.\u201d\n\nThe Young Lords and a handful of community members began dragging rusted refrigerators, old cars, mattresses and busted furniture off the corners and strewing them across Third Avenue near 110th Street. The Garbage Offensive had begun.", "description": "Fifty years ago, the Young Lords evolved from a street gang to a political force.", "authors": ["Daniel Jos\u00e9 Older"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/nyregion/11younglords-ast/11younglords-ast-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
