I counted 10, but there were other sites being worked on so there may have been more,\u201d she said.\n\nDanielle Ellis spoke of the horror of pulling corpses from rubble More\n\n\u201cIt had been completely destroyed by airstrikes. They were all adults, I\u2019m pretty sure men but it was impossible to say for sure because they were in a pretty bad way.\u201d\n\nShe said she also could not be sure whether they had been fighters with the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) or civilians.\n\n\u201cOne of the bodies I pulled out had a gun embedded in it - it could have been military but also many picked up arms to fight Turkey,\u201d said Miss Ellis, who has been a civil defence volunteer with the Kurds for almost a year. \u201cThere were children\u2019s things about, a family had been living in the house at some point.\n\n\u201cWe got most of the bodies out but some of them we had to leave as they were under reinforced concrete,\u201d she said, guessing from the smell that they had been there for several days.\n\n\u201cAll my clothes smell of death. It\u2019s under my fingernails,\u201d she said. \"It was horrifying.\"\n\nBoth sides accused the other of violating the five-day ceasefire, negotiated by Turkey and the US. Ras al-Ayn seemed the immediate test of the truce.\n\nBefore the deal's announcement, Turkish-backed forces had encircled the town and were battling fierce resistance from Kurdish fighters inside.\n\nAfter a brief lull, artillery fire and ground clashes were reported mid-morning. By the evening more than 14 Syrian civilians were reported to have been killed, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\nThe Syrian Kurds raised further uncertainty over a ceasefire deal, which was announced after Mike Pence, the US Vice President, held meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, that already was vague on key points and left significant questions unanswered.\n\nThe Kurdish administration said some provisions of the deal, which was favourable to Turkey, \"need further discussion with the United States.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, there will be a five-day pause in fighting while Kurdish forces withdraw from the border, an arrangement that hands Turkey most of what it was looking to achieve with its military offensive.\n\nHowever, the two sides appeared to have different interpretations of which areas Kurdish forces would withdraw from. Turkey said the Kurds must withdraw from all parts of the Turkish border, while the Kurds said the deal applied to only a 100-mile strip between Ras al-Aiy and Tal Abyad.", "description": "A British volunteer with Syria\u2019s Kurds has\u00a0described the \"horrifying experience\" of pulling the victims of Turkish air strikes out of the rubble, as fighting continued along the Turkish-Syrian border despite a declared ceasefire.
