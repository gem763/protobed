We call on the members of the United Nations for their recognition of the exile Government of the Manipur.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe three million Manipuri people want recognition as one of the precious native nations. Our attempts to engage with the Indian government were met with hate and hostilities, It was not possible for us to declare the independence of Manipur while in India because we, the Ministers of the Manipur State Council, would have faced arrest, torture and extra-judicial killings at the hands of the Indian forces.\u201d\n\nManipur leaders said that Narendra Modi\u2019s government is intolerant and believes in physical annihilation of small nations and communities for the sake of Hindutva supremacy and therefore it was not safe for them to continue operating from India.\n\nThey declared: \u201cThe Manipur State Council is His Highness\u2019s Government, the Maharaja of Manipur Leishemba Sanajaoba who is the Maharaja and King of Manipur. His Highness is the constitutional head of the State. Manipur is a constitutional Monarchy ruled State and the sovereign of the King of Manipur is Divine of God.\u201d\n\nThey said: \u201cThere are more than 1,528 cases of the extra-judicial killing which are pending in the Supreme Court of India. The victim were killed without trial of law. Indian army forces kill the people of Manipur with impunity. The Manipuri human rights activist Irom Charu Sharmila, known as the \u2018Iron Lady of Manipur\u2019, started protest fasting for 16 years against the controversial Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and human rights abuses. The brave women of Manipur staged nude protests in front of the Indian Army centres to condemn inhuman torture and killing of innocent people of Manipur.\u201d\n\nThey said that Manipur is being ruled through draconian laws by the Indian occupation government \u201cunder the Republic Constitution of India including Arms Forces (Special Powers) Act 1958\u201d.\n\n\u201cThousands of people have been killed since the occupation of Manipur. Nearly 4500 have been killed unlawfully in the last 10 years and more than 1500 are in prisons in illegal custody. The total loss of life stands at around 15,000 in the last few decades, they said referring to a BBC report which had unearthed the scale of unlawful killings and human rights violations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sovereign State of Manipur was excluded from British India by the Order in Council by His Majesty on 27 December 1946 and the Indian Government annexed the Manipur State of India by violation of the Act 1949,\u201d said Manipur State Council Ministers.\n\nThey said that there are many armed groups fighting the Indian forces for the restoration of independence of Manipur from India but they believe in obtaining the objectives by peaceful means.\n\nThey said they will present a resolution to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Manipur leaders Yamben Biren and Narengbam Samarjit have announced separation from India and announced to form the Manipur State Council.", "authors": ["Farid Qureshi"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Manipur.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
