The labor-intensive job is always stressful, but increasingly orchard owners are worried if they can afford to pick all the ripe fruit.\n\nRob Valicoff, the owner of Valicoff Fruit Company, which grows some 1,700 acres of apples, peaches, cherries, apricots and pears, has relied almost entirely on temporary foreign guest workers. Of his 220 employees this fall, 200 came from Mexico through the H-2A Visa program.\n\nValicoff said the program has been expensive and inflexible, yet he\u2019s forced to use it because otherwise he would not have enough workers to harvest his fruit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of scary,\u201d Valicoff said, \u201cbecause these farms got so large that the payrolls on any given week are huge.\u201d\n\nA record 250,000 H-2A Visa holders have been working this year on U.S. farms. The estimated 25,000 of them working in Washington state have been making at least $15.03 per hour, $3.03 above the state minimum wage. Additionally, farmers had to pay for their visas, provide housing and transport them from their homes to the farm and then back home when the season\u2019s over.\n\nValicoff has calculated a cost of $1,500 per H-2A worker before he\u2019s picked a single apple.\n\n\u201cAt some point, enough has to be enough,\u201d Valicoff said. \u201cWe may have to produce less because it requires so much labor.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration apparently has agreed. The Labor Department has proposed several significant changes to the H-2A program which would make it less expensive and more flexible for farmers. Currently, guest workers\u2019 pay has been set as the average farm wage paid in a given state. The goal of the so-called adverse-effect wage would be not to undercut prevailing wages for farmworkers already in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s a domestic workforce made up largely of illegal immigrants. According to the Labor Department, half of all farmworkers surveyed admitted they\u2019re unauthorized to work in the U.S. Some 29 percent said they\u2019re U.S. citizens with another 21 percent claiming to be legal permanent residents.\n\nFarmers have seen more extreme worker shortages in recent years. They\u2019ve attributed it to tighter border security, an aging immigrant farmworker population and record-low unemployment. The H-2A program was designed in the 1980s to be a stop-gap measure, but farmers increasingly have been relying more on guest workers than farmworkers already in the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s changes would be welcome to many of those farmers. Michael Marsh of the National Council of Agricultural Employers said half of the fruit and one-third of the fresh vegetables consumed by Americans have been grown outside the U.S. largely because of the rising cost of farm labor here.\n\n\u201cWe can either import our workers or we can import our food,\u201d Marsh said, \u201cand being food dependent on a foreign country to me just doesn\u2019t seem to fit our national security.\u201d\n\nLABOR DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL REINSTATED AFTER REPORT ON 'ANTI-SEMITIC' FACEBOOK POSTS SPARKS BACKLASH\n\nBut, the United Farm Workers union has seen the rising farm wages as a good thing, a function of supply and demand. UFW has opposed the changes to the H-2A program saying they\u2019ll pit farmworkers already in the U.S. against an endless supply of cheaper foreign guest labor.\n\n\u201cAny U.S. worker who\u2019s not willing to accept this lower wage can be replaced by someone who\u2019s making lower wages, through a government program, who has no rights,\u201d UFW Political and Legislative Director Giev Kashkooli said.\n\nKashkooli said not only would farm wages drop, but the amount of substandard housing for guest workers would increase. One change would allow farmers to self-inspect guest worker housing the year after a third-party inspection is done.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think most of us think that farmworkers in the United States are paid too much money,\u201d Kashkooli said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nValicoff, who\u2019s been busy trying to get his fruit boxed and to market, disagreed. He said he\u2019d see more automation, more robotics and more acreage going unfarmed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think our industry can sustain what we\u2019re doing as far as costs,\u201d Valicoff lamented.", "description": "The Labor Department has proposed several significant changes to the H-2A program which would make it less expensive and more flexible for farmers.", "authors": ["Dan Springer", "Dan Springer Joined Fox News Channel", "Fnc", "In August As A Seattle-Based Correspondent."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/16/694940094001_6086775620001_6086772124001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
