That debate came two days after the release of the Access Hollywood tape that featured Trump bragging about how his fame entitled him to \u201cgrab\u201d women \u201cby the pussy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember at the time saying, you know, the first question that\u2019s going to be asked is they\u2019re going to ask [Trump] about his comments about the Access Hollywood tape,\u201d Biden said Friday as he recounted the conversation. \u201cAnd I said, I really think what should be done is \u2014 that they\u2019re going to turn to [Clinton] and say, \u2018What\u2019s your view?\u2019 And I said, I\u2019d respectfully recommend she stand there and \u2026 say, \u2018Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let me tell you what I am going to do for the country,\u2019 and not get into the debate, because it just drags it down.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Buzzfeednews.Com Article Henrygomez Joe-Biden-Hillary-Clinton-Trump-Access-Hollywood"], "top_image": ""}
