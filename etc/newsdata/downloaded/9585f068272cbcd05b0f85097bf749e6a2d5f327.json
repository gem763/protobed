John Woodcock and Ivan Lewis, two former Labour MPs, gave the government hope that they could back a deal by voting with it to avoid an extension to article 50 on Saturday.\n\nBut Sylvia Hermon, the independent unionist MP, demanded a clear \u201cguarantee that there is nothing in this deal, this new Brexit deal, which undermines or weakens the constitutional status of Northern Ireland,\u201d in the House of Commons on Saturday. She had previously voted for May\u2019s deal, but her support for Johnson\u2019s deal appears to be in doubt.\n\nNo 10 has been working on Labour MPs and independents for several days in an effort to get them to back a deal. The withdrawal bill due to be published this week could contain concessions on giving parliament a say at future points in the Brexit process. Victoria Prentis, a Conservative MP, has been a key figure in the government\u2019s attempts to persuade Labour MPs to get behind Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nThe support of more Labour MPs could depend on the form that the vote takes. Lucy Powell, the Manchester Central MP who was one of a group of 19 MPs in the party who urged the EU to work to find a deal with Johnson before last week\u2019s resolution, said she could possibly back an agreement if it was decided through legislation rather than a straight yes or no vote.\n\nShe told Sky News: \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have voted for it if we had had a straight up and down vote on it over the weekend but I do think now that we\u2019ve got to move forward. You do have to resolve this issue, you have to resolve Brexit, even if you are somebody who is advocating a second referendum you still need to say what\u2019s going to be on the ballot paper.\n\n\u201cI think it probably now is boiling down to a Brexit of this deal versus a general election and I would really worry about a general election when we haven\u2019t actually left the EU. I worry about what that would do to the Labour party and the Labour communities that we represent.\u201d\n\nThere are 13 more Labour MPs who signed the letter saying they were in favour of leaving the EU with a deal, but they all appear to be still undecided. One of them, Emma Lewell-Buck, released a statement saying it had been a \u201ctough call\u201d as she did not want \u201cendless\u201d delay but she had voted for the Letwin amendment forcing an article 50 extension to be requested so that MPs could scrutinise the Brexit legislation.\n\nDespite the uncertainty around the vote, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cWe seem to have the numbers in the House of Commons. A lot of people say: \u2018Get this done and move on.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlmost a week ago, before an agreement with Brussels had been finalised, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, claimed the votes were there for Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nNo 10 appears to believe that there are more Labour MPs who will end up backing the prime minister\u2019s deal, despite them having voted against May\u2019s softer deal three times previously and coming under serious pressure from colleagues not to do so.\n\nPlay Video 1:41 Michael Gove insists UK will leave EU by end of October \u2013 video\n\nMichael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said on Sunday he still believed the UK would leave on 31 October with a deal, meaning MPs will have had to vote in favour of one by that date.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our determined policy. We know that the European Union wants us to leave, we know that we have a deal that allows us to leave and listening to Labour MPs like Lucy [Powell] who are very honourably wanting to make sure that the referendum mandate is fulfilled, there is now an opportunity with a good deal,\u201d he said.", "description": "Analysis of voting intentions suggests Boris Johnson is still one vote short of majority", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c18410b2730711ca5e2f6b18eeb3abdc6e129cda/192_194_2904_1742/master/2904.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=287e73ca00d4d6b9f92258361cf5be5f", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
