A parliamentary majority is around 320. A majority would need the support of a sufficient number of MPs from the following three groups: the 10 MPs from the DUP; the 21 former Tory MPs; and the group of Labour MPs who stand behind Stephen Kinnock\u2019s campaign for a Brexit compromise. The latter claim to speak for up to 50 MPs, but there is a core group of around 18-20. We think that most of the 21 [former] Tory MPs will support the deal - for which they would receive their Tory whip back. We also think that at least Kinnock\u2019s core group might support the deal.\n\nThe FT reports this morning that the DUP is asking for billions of pounds worth of support as a quid-pro-quo. But that means that they are not opposed in principle. They are just haggling over the money. If the DUP were to support it, that would probably tip the balance in favour of a deal.\n\nAnother issue for Johnson to confront is extension. There is no way, we think, that Brexit can happen by Oct 31. The Times has a story quoting German officials that the EU would take another two months until the end of the year. We think this would create renewed uncertainty, and would interfere with a UK election campaign.\n\nWe think that a one month extension, or thereabouts, seems reasonable. This would coincide with the extension of the mandate of the outgoing Juncker Commission (see our separate story below).\n\nWe also think that the extension will be part of the actual deal, and will thus supersede the Benn Brexit extension bill if the UK parliament were to find a majority in favour of the deal. If not, the Benn bill will force a three-month extension. Elections are likely in either scenario.", "description": "Parliamentary MathSeveral days ago my baseline scenario changed to \"deal\".Let's .10/17/2019 10:22:21AM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Leah Barkoukis", "Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/204/7eb51554-f6cf-4f84-8272-439cfd6df9db.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
