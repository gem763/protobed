On Live TV'", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump may have dug himself deeper into the impeachment hole on Thursday, and Fox News\u2019 Shepard Smith didn\u2019t mince words when he reported on it.\n\n\u201cAs the president faces impeachment proceedings for asking a foreign leader to investigate his political rival, today he did it again on live television,\u201d Smith said as the opener to \u201cShepard Smith Reporting.\u201d\n\nHe was referring to comments the president made to reporters outside the White House on Thursday: \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThis newest comment came in response to a question about what exactly Trump had wanted from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when he asked him in a July 25 phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. This call, which was brought to light by a whistleblower complaint, was the catalyst for an impeachment inquiry launched against the president last week.\n\nSmith did not hesitate to point out that Fox News was not aware of any federal investigation into former Vice President Biden for any violations of U.S. law and that it is illegal to ask a foreign national or country for political assistance.\n\n\u201cIf it is determined that the president made that request to help his campaign for reelection, President Trump may have violated federal law.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo our knowledge, no president before President Trump in American history has publicly asked an adversary to investigate a rival.\u201d\n\nJust hours after these comments, CNN reported that Trump discussed his two highest-polling rivals for 2020, Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), in a June 18 conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to two sources familiar with the call.\n\nThe Xi call was stored on the same secure server that the Zelensky call was stored on, CNN reported. This server is generally reserved for highly classified government secrets, according to intelligence officials.\n\nWatch Smith\u2019s segment on Fox News below:", "description": "The Fox News host blitzed the president for suggesting China should investigate Joe Biden while Trump's being investigated for also soliciting Ukraine's ...", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d967f872200007d03dcea85.jpeg?cache=a7gtopulcu&ops=1778_1000"}
