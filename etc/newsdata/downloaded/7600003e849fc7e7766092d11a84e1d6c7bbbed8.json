Wibbitz\n\nAbout 450,000 Northern Californians began to lose electricity Wednesday afternoon as the state's largest utility shut off power for the second time this month in effort to avoid the risk of sparking wildfires amid dry and windy weather.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric said the preventive outages would affect about 179,000 residential and business customer accounts. Customers in the Sierra Foothills and San Francisco Bay Area lost power beginning at 2 p.m. Pacific time, utility officials said, and others will go dark overnight. In all, portions of 17 counties will lose power.\n\nPG&E said the shutoffs will last about 48 hours. Back-up generators may bring back power for 5,000 customers sooner, said Director of Wildfire Operations Mark Quinlan, with crews setting them up Wednesday evening in cities including Placerville.\n\nThe company has been warning weather conditions may prompt the blackouts, part of a program instituted in October 2018 after PG&E equipment was blamed for igniting some of the deadliest and most destructive wildfires in state history. High winds can topple power lines or bring them in contact with dry vegetation, which can start fires.\n\nDaniel Almanza of Bayside Cafe, which was among businesses to lose power because of PG&E's public safety power shutoff, calls a supplier from the office of the restaurant in Sausalito, Calif., on Oct. 9, 2019.

Southern California Edison said it could cut power Thursday to more than 308,000 customers in seven counties and San Diego Gas & Electric warned of power shutoffs to about 42,000 customers. More than 875,000 people could be affected.\n\nAnother safety shutoff may occur late Saturday in portions of Northern California, said PG&E Chief Meteorologist Scott Strenfel, citing a wind event that could become the strongest of the season. A potential third outage would not overlap with the current one, he said, because all power will be restored by then.\n\nDuring the first round of blackouts less than two weeks ago, PG&E said it would take several days and up to a week after the winds died down to restore power to some customers, but the majority had it back within two days.\n\nA better option?: California power lines spark wildfires and prompt blackouts. Why not just bury them?\n\nAt that time, gusty winds, high temperatures and parched conditions forced the utility to leave about 2 million people in northern and central California in the dark.\n\nThat preemptive outage, or Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS), fueled outrage from many residents and political leaders. Gov. Gavin Newsom accused the energy giant of \"greed\" and \"mismanagement.\"\n\nSOURCE Pacific Gas & Electric; maps4news.com/\u00a9HERE (Photo: USA TODAY)\n\nPG&E, however, defends the outages as crucial to the safety of its customers. The company already has filed for bankruptcy after being held liable for tens of billions of dollars in damages resulting from deadly wildfires blamed on downed power lines.\n\n\"We understand the hardship caused by these shutoffs and the safety issues that it brings with it,\" said CEO and President Bill Johnson. \"But we also understand the heartbreak and devastation of catastrophic wildfire. Those losses are forever and we're determined to do everything in our power to prevent them.\"\n\nKim Schefer, manager of Village True Value Hardware in Santa Rosa, about an hour north of San Francisco, was busy Tuesday directing customers to gas cans and batteries.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not panic per se, just, \u2018Eh, we gotta do this again?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nContributing: John Bacon and Kristin Lam, USA TODAY; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/23/california-power-outages-450-000-affected-preventive-pg-e-shutoffs/4073524002/", "description": "In its second round of power outages, California utility PG&E will shut off electricity to nearly 180,000 customers, affecting about 450,000 people.", "authors": ["Jorge L.
