The location of many a Tony Jaa movie, Thailand is all this and so much more.\n\nWith friendly and fun-loving citizens, a historic and culture-rich society and balmy weather great for aquatic adventure - Thailand offers the traveller an exceptional, smile-filled time in Southeast Asia.\n\nIf you\u2019ve watched Leonardo DiCaprio in The Beach then you have but an inkling into what you should expect from this tropical getaway. A veritable paradise of jungle-topped island offset by beautiful azure waters, Thailand is a dream for those seeking out water-based adventure, whether it be diving with whale sharks, getting lit on Ko Phi-Phi or just chilling in the waters of Ko Lipe.\n\nThailand is the best place to visit if sand between your toes is a must. Here's what you need to know if you go:\n\nVisas: Not required for holders of South African passports for stays of up to 30 days.\n\n\n\nPassport validity: Passports need to be valid for at least 6 months after the departure date.\n\nCosts: Not applicable\n\nNational Carrier: Thai Airways\n\n\n\nAirport Hub: Suvarnabhumi Airport\n\nUseful app to download: Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport (iOS, Android) app for flight tracking and information.\n\nFlight Route Access:\n\nEthiopian Airlines, Korean Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Emirates, British Airways, Kenya Airways, Qatar Airways, Cathay Pacific.\n\nFlight time: 11 hours, 41 minutes from Johannesburg to Bangkok.\n\nCurrency: Thai Baht\n\nMedical and health:\n\nYou should be up to date on routine vaccinations while travelling to any destination. Thailand, like many Asian countries, should be approached with caution when it comes to medical care and disease prevention. Beyond the routine vaccinations, you may want to consider some specifically for travel.\n\nSome vaccines and medication may also be required for problem-free travel. While there are no specific vaccination or medical requirements for entry, for South Africans, into the country it is recommended that you do get inoculated against some relatively common medical problems.\n\nCommon illnesses experienced by travellers in Thailand include respiratory infections and diarrhoea which are, fortunately, preventable and easily treatable.\n\nGet vaccinated for hepatitis A as food and water standards are questionable, particularly if you\u2019ve got a taste for exotic street-foods. Another potential medical pitfall to avoid is typhoid which you can get through the consumption of contaminated food or water so get vaccinated particularly if you\u2019re planning to go off the beaten track.\n\nDon't skimp on travel and medical insurance either as it is always good to be prepared for any eventuality.\n\nReligion: The overwhelming majority of Thai citizens subscribe to Theravada Buddhism.\n\n\n\nTravel Adapter: Yes - The power sockets are of type A and C. The standard voltage is 220 V and the frequency is 50 Hz.\n\nCountry code: +66\n\nTime Zone: ICT (UTC+7) Thailand is 5-hours ahead of South Africa.\n\nEmergencies: General emergencies - 191, Medical - 1554, Fire -199, Tourist police - 1155\n\nPublic Transport:\n\nKnown to be home to some of the world\u2019s most chaotic road transportation, Thailand sure does make flying around everywhere seem very appealing. That being said, the trains in Thailand are punctual, fairly frequent and relatively comfortable. Taking a trip on one of these trains is a great, albeit slow, way to see the country without the manic frenzy that is road-based travel in the country.\n\nIf you\u2019re a bold adventurer who is looking for the authentic experience of travelling as a local, a great way to ease into the chaos is to hit the roads and hop onto a bus. With a prolific and reliable bus network, every city and town is linked together by the bus network. They\u2019re really fast and usually air-conditioned - just don\u2019t watch the driver do his thing lest you end up fearing for your life.\n\nFor an even more to-the-ground experience, jump into one of Thailand\u2019s many tuk-tuks or rickshaws. One thing Thailand does not lack for is a variety of transport options on their roads. Remember to negotiate and settle on a price before you enter a tuk-tuk or rickshaw.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get driven around in relative comfort of a cab then consider downloading the local equivalent of Uber called \u2018GrabCar\u2019. You can download the app here (Android, iOS).\n\nEatigo ( iOS Android ) for getting great discounts on delicious local food daily.\n\nClimate:\n\nThe climate in Thailand is largely influenced by a set of distinct monsoons. The north-east monsoon, which starts in October and runs through February, brings with it cold, dry air which brings a chill to bear over most of the country.\n\nIn the south of Thailand, this north-east monsoon brings milder temperatures and increased rainfall. The southwest monsoon winds, which run from May through October, brings with it warm moist air emanating from the Indian Ocean.\n\nThis period is marked by rainfall over the majority of the country and warm, balmy weather. Monsoon season, however, lasts from July to November in the north and central areas. Expect humid and wet weather!\n\nBest time to go:\n\n\n\nThe peak season in Thailand is from November to March as the landscapes are incredibly lush and the temperatures are comfortable following the monsoon season. Not unexpectedly, prices go up for almost everything from hotel and resort prices to flights. Book well ahead as you may be surprised to find out just how in-demand Thailand is.\n\nWith balmy weather and relaxed coastal/resort vibes to enjoy, this is a great time to enjoy everything that Thailand has on offer. The monsoon season, running from July through to November, would have also passed so it won\u2019t be as humid and wet making this period an excellent time to explore Thailand.\n\nLanguage: The official language is Thai but other languages commonly spoken include Isan, Kam Mueang and Pak Tai.\n\nUseful phrases to know:\n\n\n\nWith millions of tourists visiting its shores every year, you\u2019ll rarely find yourself battling with communication in Thailand - at least not in the main tourist centres that is. Your biggest issue, you\u2019ll find, is being able to decipher the written script but even that\u2019s no major issue. With all that being said, it is always good to learn a few key phrases to make your stay run smoothly. Download an audio language app - Duolingo makes learning a new language easy and fun.\n\nUseful app to download: Google Translate makes deciphering text and translating language simple (Android, iOS).\n\nS\u00afw?s\u00afdi txn ch\u00eaa (good day/morning)\n\nS\u00afw?s\u00afdi txn yen (good evening)\n\nHellow (hello)\n\nLa k`xn (goodbye)\n\nCh?\u00af`x k\u00afhxng c\u00afh?n kh?\u00afx\u2026 (My name is\u2026)\n\nChi` (Yes)\n\nM?` (No)\n\nNi` rakha th\u00e8a h\u00af?r`?

Keeping several basics in mind will help ensure you don\u2019t have any unpleasant interactions.\n\nThais have deep respect and highly revere their Monarch. As such it is highly offensive, and illegal to disrespect the royal family in any way.\n\nInstead of a handshake, you can expect the wai. With hands pressed together like prayer hands at chest height and a slight bow, the wai is a greeting that visitors should expect to reciprocate - but only to persons of equal status.\n\nBe modest when visiting religious sites and temples - shoulders, torsos, thighs and elbows should be covered out of respect and shoes should be removed before entering.\n\nWomen are encouraged to have as little contact with monks as possible.\n\nYour feet are the literal and metaphorical bottom of your body so watch where you point them. Sit with them tucked behind you when facing the image of Buddha and never direct them at anybody.\n\nWhile you may feel comfortable by the smiling locals, don't forget to be modest in disposition and appearance. At the beach, this means no nudity and covering up to and from the beach.\n\nYou can expect to do a lot of walking so comfortable, slip-proof shoes are a good idea.\n\nLike many Asian cultures, there is great emphasis on surface harmony as embodied in the concept of \u2018face\u2019. Basically, leave all your will to express negative emotion at home. Arguing or anger can be embarrassing and will lose you face in the eyes of Thai people.\n\nUse the spoon. Many places will serve food and provide a knife and fork. The fork is used to scoop the food into the spoon which then goes into your mouth. That's the only way to do it if you don\u2019t want to end up looking like a silly foreigner.\n\nThe fastest way to endear yourself to the Thai people is to smile and to return the smiles of the locals. It isn\u2019t called The Land of Smiles for no reason.\n\nTop attractions in Thailand:", "description": "Thailand is one of the world's most popular tropical holiday destinations.
