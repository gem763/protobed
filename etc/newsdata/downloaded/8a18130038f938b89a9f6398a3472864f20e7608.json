Here, RT sport takes a look back at the top five knockouts from GGG.\n\nCurtis Stevens, November 2013, Retired round 8\n\nBrooklynite Curtis Stevens had his own reputation as a rock-fisted puncher in the middleweight division when he went up against Golovkin for the WBA and IBO titles at Madison Square Garden in 2013.\n\nHailing from the same Brownsville neighborhood as Mike Tyson, Stevens had racked up 18 KOs from 26 wins by the time of their meeting.\n\nNicknamed the 'Cerebral Assassin', Stevens graced home turf to take on Golovkin and it didn't take long for the New Yorker to feel his fabled power.\n\nTwo thunderous left hooks put Stevens on the seat of his pants in the second round and the damage was evident by Stevens' look of sheer shock on his face.\n\nGolovkin dropping Curtis Stevens pic.twitter.com/BLSEp5sCRB \u2014 Niall Doran (@NiallerDoran) September 14, 2017\n\nAstonshingly, Stevens sustained six more rounds of punsihment before his corner called a halt to proceedings in round eight.\n\nMatthew Macklin, June 2013, KO round 3\n\nBritish-based Irishman Matthew Macklin had twice fought for the middleweight championship before meeting Golovkin, coming up just short against Felix Sturm and Sergio Martinez for versions of the title in 12 and 11 rounds respectively, and was considered a bona fide contender for the champion's crown.\n\nWhen the two met at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Golovkin ensured his night with Macklin wouldn't last nearly as long.\n\nGennady Golovkin's iconic left hook bodyshot KO of Matthew Macklin in their June 2013 World title fight.\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udd4a\ud83e\udd4a\ud83e\udd4a\n\n\n\n*Wince*\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33#CaneloGGG#GGGpic.twitter.com/2odTaLmq3E \u2014 Behind The Gloves (@BehindTheGloves) September 17, 2017\n\nPerhaps the most vicious KO of Golovkin's career was delivered in round three when the champion backed Macklin into the ropes and ripped a perfect left hand to the liver to crumple Macklin to the floor and send him writhing around in agony.\n\nDavid Lemieux, October 2015, TKO round 8\n\nWhen Golovkin took on David Lemieux at MSG to defend his titles, it was considered perhaps the meeting of the two hardest hitters in the middleweight division.\n\nThe Canadian contender had racked up 31 KOs in 34 wins against two defeats, having acquired the IBF belt in his previous fight.\n\nLemieux suffered a vicious beating from the first bell, and as the fight went on Golovkin adminstered a savage body attack, dropping Lemieux in the fifth round with a perfect left to the liver.\n\n#OnThisDay 2015: Gennady Golovkin vs David Lemieux.

The 36-year-old has in his arsenal the knack to exploit the most tender parts of an opponents body.\n\nNo matter how good a fighter's defense, 'Triple G' always seems to find away past the guard with with a laser-like precision.\n\nThat was never more evident than in his 2014 fight with Marco Antonio Rubio. On a six-fight win streak since losing a WBC title tilt against Julio Cesar Chavez, Rubio was confident heading into their StubHub Center clash.\n\nAny confidence was knocked clean out of the Mexican in the second round, when Golovkin unleashed a looping left hook high round and over Rubio's guard that came crashing down onto the top of his head.\n\nSuch a punch seemed firstly improbable to execute, and even less likely to knock a fighter out. But it did exactly that, scrambling Rubio's senses and dropping him for the count.\n\nDaniel Geale, July 2014, TKO round 3\n\nFormer WBA and IBF world middleweight champion was considered perhaps the toughest test of Golovkin's career at that point, but Golovkin attacked the Australian from the off at his Madison Square Garden second home, neutralizing his opponent's footwork by battering him into the ropes with solid right hands.\n\nOne of those rights caught Geale high on the back of the head and sent him crashing to the floor in the second round, and although Geale jumped straight back up the damage had been done.\n\nIn the third, Geale had his best success in landing a straight right to Golovkin's face as the Kazakh champion wound up his own right hand. Barely flinching, Golovkin still managed to follow trough and nail Geale to deck him again.\n\nGennady Golovkin destroys Daniel Geale straight after taking a flush right hand... pic.twitter.com/5V3ygl6hxM \u2014 Boxing Memes \ud83e\udd4a (@Boxing_Memes) March 18, 2017\n\nGeale bravely rose, attempted to bounce across the ring to regain his senses, but a resigned shake of the head from the beaten contender forced the referee to wave off the action and Golovkin carved out another terrorizing KO win.", "description": "Former middleweight king Gennady Gennadyevich Golovkin returns to action this Saturday against Sergiy Derevyanchenko, with fans of 'Triple G' expecting another 'big drama show' from the Kazakh KO artist at Madison Square Garden.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5d97735e85f5403d28144b2e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
