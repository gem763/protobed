TheGeekzTeam YouTube channel, where the video is displayed, was viewed more than 129,000 times on Monday, up from an average of about 600 views a day, according to data from the tracking site Social Blade.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s online provocateurs on Monday portrayed the parody video\u2019s viral distribution as a victory \u2014 and a reason to create more like it.\n\nSome pro-Trump supporters wrote online that they were giddy that the violent video had been shared en masse, including by journalists, whose revulsion they have claimed as a badge of honor. Others said they were emboldened by the impact the video had made and would continue pushing the boundaries in future memes. One pro-Trump user early Monday tweeted that the furious reaction to the video \u201cis why the meme was made.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese new memes are the 21st century version of political cartoons. Get f---ed you p---ies,\u201d the user AllesErdreich wrote Monday on the pro-Trump Reddit forum The_Donald. The user said the media was seeking to \u201ccry and manipulate \u2026 zombies into clutching their pearls at the thought of (nonexistent) fascistic violence towards the free press. They do this because they realize they are losing control to independent content creators on the internet.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBecca Lewis, who researches online subcultures and media manipulation for Stanford University and the think tank Data & Society, said the video\u2019s sharing showed how such memes have become a potent force for political expression and propaganda. The meme creators, she said, routinely sought mainstream attention for the memes in a way that would make the shocking content seem more and more acceptable.\n\n\u201cThe attention economy makes it so that whoever is interested in promoting the most shocking stuff ends up getting a tailor-made news cycle for themselves,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe mainstream media gets shocked and disgusted and therefore posts the video, but that in turn gives more viewership to the video. And there\u2019s nothing the meme creators want more than to shock and disgust the mainstream media.\"\n\nThe incendiary video was aired at a conference held by the pro-Trump group American Priority at Trump\u2019s golf resort in Doral, Fla., a Miami suburb, and was first reported by the New York Times. American Priority distanced itself from the video in a statement appended to its website publicizing what it called a three-day festival.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis video was not approved, seen or sanctioned by the #AMPFest19 organizers,\u201d the statement said, adding that organizers were not aware of the video until they were contacted by the Times. The statement claimed authorized sessions included one denouncing political violence.\n\nIn the video, a man dressed in a suit, with Trump\u2019s head superimposed on the body, embarks on a bloody rampage in a church, targeting occupants labeled with the logos of media organizations, including The Washington Post; lawmakers including Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.); Republicans John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah); and others including an image labeled \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d The assault was taken from a scene of a graphic brawl in the 2014 action movie \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service.\u201d\n\nThe news drew widespread criticism, including from Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, who warned in a tweet it \u201cwill get people killed.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocratic lawmakers also sharply rebuked the White House. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.), who leads the House\u2019s top tech-focused committee, described the video as \u201cabhorrent,\u201d criticizing Trump for having \u201cpromoted extremist voices\u201d in a bid to boost his presidency. Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), meanwhile, fretted the incident was \u201cdisturbing, but frankly not surprising.\"\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, Mr. Trump has cultivated support from some of the worst corners of the internet. He\u2019s used his office to elevate this toxic internet culture while ignoring the real challenges we face on social media,\u201d Warner said in a statement.\n\nReacting early Monday, Stephanie Grisham, the president\u2019s press secretary, said Trump \u201chas not yet seen the video,\u201d and would watch later, \u201cbut based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt least one of the pro-Trump firebrands tied to the videos attended a \u201csocial media summit\u201d hosted by the White House in July, where Trump previously had lauded their efforts and attacked social media companies for allegedly censoring conservatives. The event sparked fresh fears that the White House was endorsing their controversial online tactics ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nThe church-shooting video has been viewable since July 2018 on the YouTube account of TheGeekzTeam, whose subscriber count rose 1,000 on Monday to 19,000. The account, which says it is \u201cdedicated to pissing off liberals,\u201d includes more than two dozen videos celebrating Trump and tearing down his opponents. Its most recent, in August, is a spoof of the action movie \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 3 \u2014 Parabellum,\u201d and shows Trump shooting up Sanders, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Andrew Yang.\n\nTheGeekzTeam is one of several contributors to MemeWorld, a pro-Trump meme site created by a far-right Internet personality who calls himself Carpe Donktum but whose real name is Logan Cook. The self-described \u201cmemesmith\u201d attended the White House social media summit in July and met personally with Trump, who called him a \u201cgenius.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTrump is absolutely engaging the darkest sides of some of the most extreme people in this country right now,\u201d said Dipayan Ghosh, co-director of the Digital Platforms & Democracy Project and Shorenstein fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, and a former policy adviser to the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cHe himself posted a video with similar themes two years ago. Meanwhile he\u2019s not challenged the extreme views of many of the far-right,\u201d Ghosh added. \u201cThe fact that he cannot come out and make a strident statement against violence and this kind of behavior is absolutely shocking and not appropriate for the president of the country.\"\n\nPro-Trump meme creators defended the video as a political parody, and said the online fury over its screening at the Trump resort was overwrought because it had been played in the corner of a room away from the main conference events. In its statement, American Priority called the video \u201cunauthorized\u201d and noted it had been shown in a side room, and not from the event\u2019s main stage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA festival schedule advertised a \u201cMAGA Comedy Night,\u201d a VIP yacht party, and speeches and meet-and-greets with Donald Trump Jr., Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. Attendees could participate in sessions titled \u201cMemetics,\u201d \u201cCrushing Social Media Distortion and Dishonesty,\u201d \u201cTo War With Words\u201d and \u201cSocial Media Messages that Work.\u201d\n\nSeveral Trump backers laughed off the argument that the meme and videos like it could incite violence. Carpe Donktum, the Kansas man who has previously requested his full name not be used because he fears online or in-person harassment, tweeted a number of memes early Monday morning satirizing the argument, including one from \u201cStar Wars\u201d in which a Death Star labeled \u201cMemes\u201d blows up a planet labeled \u201cMainstream Media.\u201d \u201cThis is an incitement of violence. Please do not share,\u201d he wrote. It\u2019s been viewed more than 50,000 times.\n\nIn a statement, Carpe Donktum said the video was \u201cCLEARLY satirical\u201d and that \u201cno reasonable person would believe that this video was a call to action, or an endorsement of violence towards the media.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis attack is yet another example of the Mainstream Media\u2019s hypocrisy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe MSM could not find any controversy within the conference itself, so they have manufactured this outrage campaign to discredit its success.\u201d\n\nTheGeekzTeam did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Monday, TheGeekzTeam\u2019s Twitter account, which calls itself a home for \u201cspicy Trump memes,\u201d posted a meme showing \u201cTrump Memes\u201d causing CNN to explode.\n\nYouTube, which is owned by Google, added a restriction to the pro-Trump meme video Monday that forced viewers to confirm that they were an adult before viewing. \u201cFor content containing violence that is clearly fictional, we age-restrict and display a warning interstitial. We applied these protections to this video,\u201d said Ivy Choi, a spokeswoman for YouTube.\n\nTwitter did not respond to a request for comment. On Monday afternoon, Carpe Donktum\u2019s Twitter account was briefly suspended for, he said, violating the social media site\u2019s copyright rules with another video. But he was quickly reinstated.\n\nFor these sites and others, the incendiary posts, tweets, photos and videos by Trump\u2019s online allies have proved to be a vexing political and policy challenge. On one hand, the content could violate each of the sites\u2019 policies, raising fresh questions as to whether Google and Twitter have taken sufficient steps to ensure their services don\u2019t become conduits for real-world violence. At the same time, these tech giants often face criticism for going too far, particularly from Trump and his peers who claim that Silicon Valley is biased against conservatives.\n\nThe president even convened the social media summit in July to take aim at sites including Facebook, Google and Twitter, while rallying some of his most fervent online supporters ahead of the 2020 election. Among the roughly 200 conservatives in the room were some of the Web\u2019s most controversial provocateurs who have shared doctored videos and spread conspiracy theories about Trump\u2019s opponents.\n\n\u201cSome of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable,\u201d Trump said.\n\nPro-Trump meme creators have routinely built dark parodies and shareable memes from Hollywood films, superimposing the faces of journalists they dislike and the logos of media organizations onto characters getting beaten up or humiliated by a mighty Trump character.\n\nCarpe Donktum\u2019s memes, which have often been widely boosted by Trump supporters on sites such as Reddit and Twitter, include one in which he animated former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s apology video to show the candidate caressing his own shoulders.\n\n\u201cWhere is the genius? I want to meet the genius,\u201d Trump said to Carpe Donktum as the men entered the Oval Office, according to the recollection of another pro-Trump meme creator called @mad_liberals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of harassment.", "description": "The video's airing at a conservative event \u2014 and its mass sharing afterward \u2014 revealed how the once-fringe movements of online trolling and meme-making have helped reshape mainstream politics and the media.", "authors": ["Drew Harwell", "Reporter Covering Artificial Intelligence", "Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pogimUdmoUm_CMp6WU-f4oVZVbs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DLZYTAXOLQI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
