I experienced that at Arsenal.\n\n\"We were twenty consecutive years in the top four but in the end it was not enough anymore.\n\n\"Today if you get into the Champions League people are very happy.\n\n\"That happened to Pochettino. Once you're somewhere four or five years, no matter how good a job you have done, you have to show people you can give even more. He's at that stage.\"\n\n(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)\n\nWenger continued to dissect Tottenham's miserable run of form, which saw them lose 7-2 to Bayern Munich last week and 3-0 to Brighton at the weekend.\n\nHe added\": \"When I played them two or three years ago, they looked like a young, hungry team who had found good strengths, good core of the team with people who were together, growing inside the club.\n\n\"They expressed that hunger and players from outside were vital, like Eriksen. Today, you don't feel exactly the same chemistry, and a player like Eriksen is a bit sidelined because it looks like he doesn't want to commit his future to the club.\n\n\"Modern life is down to small margins, and these small margins at the moment are not in their favour. Will they get that back?\"", "description": "Former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger drew parallels with Mauricio Pochettino's situation with rivals Tottenham", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Bein Sports", "Arsenal Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20530148.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-07-at-122557.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
