That\u2019s especially true when the media flips out over something said on Twitter.\n\nA prime example is how the media has latched onto Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s tweet telling Sen. Ted Cruz to \u201ckeep our name out of your mouth\u201d after Cruz pointed to the epidemic of violence that plagues the Windy City.\n\n60% of illegal firearms recovered in Chicago come from outside IL\u2014mostly from states dominated by coward Republicans like you who refuse to enact commonsense gun legislation. Keep our name out of your mouth. https://t.co/yVM4JHL3xy pic.twitter.com/pr613A3dpf \u2014 Lori Lightfoot (@LightfootForChi) September 3, 2019\n\nOf course, she\u2019s not wrong about where the guns come from. Many of the guns used for violence crime do come from Indiana as well as many other states.\n\nThe problem, though, is that Lightfoot is ignoring one very important fact. If access to guns is the problem, why isn\u2019t Indiana more violent than Chicago in the first place?\n\nIf guns from Indiana are to blame for Chicago\u2019s problems, then shouldn\u2019t Indiana have plenty of problems of their own?\n\nYet they don\u2019t. Why is that?\n\nProbably because violence is a complex issue that\u2019s not solved by simplistic measures like gun control. Chicago is more than ample proof of that. As Sen. Cruz noted, it\u2019s had aggressive gun control for years and violence has gone up and up. The gun control has done nothing except curtail the rights of law-abiding citizens.\n\nMeanwhile, the criminals break all kinds of laws, including those against them getting guns.\n\nWhile Lightfoot can try to blame states like Indiana for her city\u2019s problems, she forgets that going across state lines to buy a gun then taking it back into Chicago already violates federal law. Rules that have already been put in place to address this issue are being ignored, so why should new rules change that?\n\nLightfoot also fails to note just how those guns ended up in Chicago. I mean, she tells us where they originated, but the means by which they ended up in her city is important, too. Who bought them and how did they end up in the hands of Chicagoland criminals?\n\nLuckily, I\u2019m going to answer that one for you. First, many of those firearms were stolen from people in Indiana. In other words, Lightfoot is blaming criminal victims for being the victim of criminals.\n\nSecond, many were purchased illegally through straw purchasers, people without criminal histories who can purchase firearms for those who can\u2019t. This, like stealing a gun, is an illegal practice.\n\nThe truth is, most of Chicago\u2019s violent criminals are recidivists who have been arrested more than once. Further, judges in the city routinely release them over and over to continue being violent on the streets of the city, all while people like Lightfoot continue to blame their neighbors for their inability to keep their own house in order.\n\nWhile the media seems to love Lightfoot telling Cruz to \u201ckeep our name out of your mouth,\u201d she needs to focus on keeping actual facts in her mouth instead of the nonsense she\u2019s been spewing. Her city is falling apart and rather than address the problem, she wants to blame someone else for her city\u2019s mistakes.\n\nGun control is a failure in Chicago and she\u2019s too dense to understand that.", "description": "She warned Sen.
