Through the scorecard, the FHFA outlined the priorities for Fannie and Freddie for the next year. For the first time, the agency is requiring the two enterprises to come up with plans for how they will exit conservatorship.\n\nIn 2020, the FHFA will require Fannie and Freddie to assist regulators in determining what overlaps exist between the two enterprises and the FHA.\n\n\u201cThoughtfully addressing these overlaps makes sense for both the Enterprises and FHA because they were created to perform different roles in our housing finance system,\u201d FHFA Director Mark Calabria said. \u201cIn order to prepare to responsibly exit conservatorship, Fannie and Freddie must not repeat the mistakes of the crisis by stretching to serve borrowers who are better served by FHA.\u201d\n\nBut Calabria argued that having Fannie and Freddie move away from this market wouldn\u2019t result in prospective borrowers having fewer options for home financing. \u201cThe intention is that there are no gaps,\u201d he told reporters during a separate briefing. \u201cThe intention is to take a holistic view point, rather than have an approach where Fannie, Freddie and FHA are all fighting for market share.\u201d\n\nHistorically, Fannie and Freddie have competed for market share with the FHA, and in recent years the two enterprises have offered more mortgages with low down payments and to borrowers with high debt-to-income ratios, similar to the types of loans the FHA was designed to offer to lower- and moderate-income Americans.\n\nThose loans are riskier for lenders however, because the borrower has less equity in the property and more debt to grapple with, which can cause problems in an economic downturn.\n\nThe dollar amount in loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own or guarantee is roughly 500 times larger than the amount they have in capital reserves.\n\nFannie and Freddie tend to serve borrowers with better credit scores, even when offering products similar to the FHA\u2019s. That\u2019s left the FHA, which is fully taxpayer-backed, with a riskier pool of loans.\n\n\u201cThat decreases the credit quality of FHA and forces FHA in the long run to raise premiums,\u201d Calabria said. \u201cIf you do that long enough, you don\u2019t have anybody left except the worst credit risks.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Calabria once again raised the alarm regarding the risk that Fannie and Freddie could fail again. Currently, the dollar amount in loans that the two enterprises own or guarantee is roughly 500 times larger than the amount they have in capital reserves.\n\nAs a result, timing is posing the greatest challenge to the FHFA\u2019s efforts to get Fannie and Freddie out of conservatorship, Calabria said. If either of the housing or equity markets softens in the near future, that would make it much harder for Fannie and Freddie to raise capital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not forecasting a downturn, but if we do have a downturn in the next couple years, they will fail,\u201d Calabria said. \u201cThey will become insolvent, and they will run out of capital.\u201d", "description": "For the first time, the Federal Housing Finance Agency called on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to strategize exits from conservatorship.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU222_mark_c_ZG_20191029123013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
