However, next time you hear Vera Rubin didn't win for discovering dark matter bc *insert excuse here*, let today show exactly why she didn't win for discovering one of cosmology's most pressing questions: she was a woman. \u2014 Sophia Gad-Nasr \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@Astropartigirl) October 8, 2019\n\nIt is absolutely possible to acknowledge and celebrate the work of new #NobelPrize laureates while also pointing out the absurdity of them continuing to ignore women. \u2014 Dr Darren Saunders (@whereisdaz) October 8, 2019\n\nit\u2019s nice to finally see some white men win the #NobelPrize after decades of being excluded \u2014 Michael Eisen (@mbeisen) October 7, 2019\n\nOver the past 118 years, only 20 women have been awarded a Nobel Prize in the categories of physics, chemistry, physiology and medicine, according to an analysis by UN Women, which visually showed the lack of diversity in a GIF shared on Twitter.\n\nReady for the #NobelPrize announcements?

She won the Nobel Prize alongside two men for her work in \"the directed evolution of enzymes.\"\n\nDonna Strickland of Canada became the third women in history -- and the first in 55 years -- to win the Nobel Prize in Physics. She was also a co-winner with two men.\n\nPHOTO: Donna Strickland smiles as she receives a standing ovation during a press conference in Waterloo, Ontario, Oct. 2, 2018.|This undated handout photo shows biochemical engineer Frances H.

The Nobel Prize pointed out in a tweet this week that Goeppert-Mayer, who won her Nobel Prize at age 57, did most of her award-winning research for free.\n\nThe second woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics was Maria Goeppert-Mayer for her work on the nuclear shell structure of atoms. She received the prize when she was 57 years old and did most of her Nobel Prize-awarded research for free.#NobelPrize pic.twitter.com/RmzCpdrdfu \u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 8, 2019\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which oversees the Nobel Prize, introduced measures before this year's awards with the hope of achieving a more diverse range of nominees in the science categories.\n\nG\u00f6ran Hansson, the academy's secretary-general, told Nature magazine earlier this month that the changes led to a \"positive\" but \"small\" trend of more women being nominated for awards.", "description": "The 2019 Nobel Prize winners in the categories of physics, chemistry, physiology and medicine have been announced and none of the winners are women.
