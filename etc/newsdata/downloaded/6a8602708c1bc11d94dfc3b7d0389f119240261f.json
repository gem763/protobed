So business is booming, the country's addicted, and it's really, really out of control.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking super labs,\u201d another former DEA agent, Kevin Hartmann, told a local TV station in Texas. \u201cSuper labs that can produce multi hundred kilograms of methamphetamine.\u201d\n\nA police officer from the Narcotics Control Board stands on guard in front of bags of methamphetamine pills in Ayutthaya province, north of Bangkok.

They\u2019re finding clandestine laboratories capable of producing tons of methamphetamine and making huge seizures, as opposed to today, at the current time, most of the domestic meth is made using what they call the shake and bake method, which it basically produces a very small two ounces.\u201d\n\nThe arrest and imprisonment of Mexican drug dealer and kingpin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d hasn\u2019t stemmed the tide. In his place, with no major drug lords or intense media attention, these cartels have reorganized themselves, and they\u2019ve taken advantage of the situation and even expanded to newer markets.\n\nDrug kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman is escorted to a helicopter at Mexico City's airport on January 8, 2016 following his recapture during an intense military operation in Los Mochis, in Sinaloa State.
