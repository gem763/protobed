It creates a tempo in the stadium and the opposition don't like it.\n\n\"We always used to play like that early on, get the ball forward and turn teams and it gives you a foothold in the game to play football.\"\n\nSolskjaer added: \"Liverpool won the Champions League final with a hook in behind in the first 40 seconds. You have to be unpredictable and I think we have been like that today.\"", "description": "Adam Lallana's late strike earned Jurgen Klopp's side a point on an afternoon of controversy at the Theatre of Dreams", "authors": ["James Whaling", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20663693.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Liverpool-Premier-League-Old-Trafford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
