(Note: This report only examines coverage of Trump himself, not generic stories about his administration\u2019s activities or those of other top-ranking officials, which accounted for an additional 213 minutes of evening news airtime.)\n\nThe airtime devoted to Trump was eleven times greater than that spent on the leading Democratic candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden (just under 74 minutes), and vastly more than the networks gave California Senator Kamala Harris (30 minutes), South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (15 minutes) or Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren (just under 14 minutes).", "description": "", "authors": ["Rich Noyes", "Newsbusters.Org Blogs Nb Rich-Noyes"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
