(AP) - A Bengal tiger has died at Tampa\u2019s Busch Gardens after getting into an \u201catypical altercation\u201d with its brother.\n\nThe park announced Bala\u2019s death in a statement Tuesday. Officials say a necropsy was being completed.\n\nSiblings Bala and Bhutan had lived in the park since 2007. Park spokeswoman Rebecca Romzek said Bhutan isn\u2019t being treated for injuries, but they are closely checking him.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Times reports eight tigers live at Busch Gardens and they rotate on and off in the park\u2019s Jungala habitat where visitors can see them.\n\nBala was known as the \u201credhead\u201d of the park\u2019s tigers. She had a strawberry white/blonde coloration, which is caused by a gene mutation that makes the tiger\u2019s striping paler than usual.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Bengal tiger has died at Tampa's Busch Gardens after getting into an \"atypical altercation\" with its brother.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
