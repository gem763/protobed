Jones\u2019s side ran out comfortable winners after Tom\u00e1s Lavanini\u2019s 18th-minute red card and the only downside was Billy Vunipola\u2019s twisted ankle. England are set to confirm the extent of that injury on Monday.\n\nEngland dismiss feisty Argentina after Tom\u00e1s Lavanini sees red Read more\n\nVictory, however, means that if England beat France this weekend they will top Pool C. That would most likely mean a quarter-final against Australia with the winner of that match on a collision course with New Zealand \u2013 who racked up the highest points score of the tournament so far against Namibia on Sunday \u2013 in the last four.\n\nAll Blacks fall behind before brushing aside brave Namibia at Rugby World Cup Read more\n\nThe losers, meanwhile, are expected to face Wales in the quarter-finals but would be on the opposite side of the draw to the All Blacks and could not meet them until the final. Last year, England\u2019s footballers found themselves in a similar position before their last World Cup group match against Belgium. Gareth Southgate made nine changes to his side with England already assured of qualification and the 1-0 defeat ensured they were on the opposite side of the draw to France \u2013 the eventual winners \u2013 Brazil and the European champions, Portugal.\n\nJones, however, claimed that he has not even looked at permutations despite a likely meeting with his home country. Asked if England need to beat France, Jones said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, [I\u2019m] not even looking at it. The only thing I know is we are playing France. I don\u2019t know any of the permutations, I don\u2019t know where the quarter-final is. It doesn\u2019t concern me because all I\u2019m concerned about is France next week.\n\n\u201cWe are where we need to be and we haven\u2019t played to our best yet \u2013 which is good, because we\u2019ve got growth and that\u2019s what this competition is about. It\u2019s about growing, it\u2019s about building, it\u2019s about being right when you need to be right. It\u2019s our next game, our most important game. We want to win every game. I think we can improve the team [against France]. That\u2019ll be the challenge: how can we improve the team?\u201d\n\nMako Vunipola made his comeback from his hamstring injury against Argentina, coming off the bench on 63 minutes and he is likely to start against France. He first suffered the injury in Saracens\u2019 Champions Cup final victory in May but having aggravated it in the World Cup warm-up victory over Ireland last month, Vunipola thought his tournament may have been over. \u201cI had a fear that that could be it,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know exactly and didn\u2019t understand what had happened. When I had the scan and got the results back it wasn\u2019t ideal but luckily the specialist was able to clear it up and I am just happy to be here now and get that game under my belt.\n\nMako Vunipola boost for England but Jack Nowell \u2018touch and go\u2019 for World Cup Read more\n\n\u201cWe want to win everything we play in. Next week will be no different, so we want to have a good week\u2019s preparation, prepare for France as best we can and then go out there and try to win the game. It would be difficult for a player to go out there and not have anything but that in their head, that\u2019s how injuries happen and you start overthinking things.\u201d\n\nGeorge Ford, who again shone at fly-half against Argentina, was similarly dismissive of the suggestion England should aim to finish second in their pool. \u201cWe can\u2019t fall into that trap one bit. We\u2019ve got to take each game as it comes and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done so far,\u201d he said. \u201cThree games down, we just go for the next one now which is France, who are challenging opponents. I think to win this [tournament] you\u2019ve got to win every single game, so it\u2019s just the next one for us.\u201d\n\nDespite already securing England\u2019s qualification, Jones will not be able to attend the funeral of his friend and former Randwick club mentor Jeff Sayle in Australia this week. Jones had hoped to fly back to attend the funeral on Friday before returning for Saturday\u2019s match against France in Yokohama but will now be staying in Japan. It is understood Jones has spoken with the former Australia international Glen Ella, who served as England\u2019s backs coach in 2016 and 2017, who will pass on his condolences.", "description": "Eddie Jones, the England coach, has claimed he is not concerned about the permutations of finishing first or second in Pool C", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec3e648f199242195d34243ca3728ad8e6c6671f/0_60_4932_2959/master/4932.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9c04ce84f6e92b5447259a9d41435578", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
