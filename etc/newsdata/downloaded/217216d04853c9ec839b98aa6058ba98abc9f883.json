The pension is investing at the early stage as a way of growing the Quebec ecosystem, according to Charles \u00c9mond, head of global strategic planning: \u201cWithout a rich and dynamic startup ecosystem, there is a risk of considerably fewer quality investment opportunities in the subsequent growth and maturity phases, especially in disruptive niches.\u201d (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: The Caisse is looking to shore up its pipeline of Quebec startups as the fund is in the midst of a global tech push. In August, The Logic reported it was looking to launch a fund of up to $2 billion focused on \u201cdisruptive technologies,\u201d while simultaneously challenging existing investments at risk of being disrupted. This $50 million comes as the Caisse is facing growing pressure from other early stage-focused funds. Voyager Capital raised a $130-million round earlier this month focused on early-stage funds, partially in Canada. Information Venture Partners raised a $96-million fund in September. The move also comes about a week after the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan made its own early-stage tech move through Koru, a Toronto-based incubator that it hopes will generate up to 20 new firms.", "description": "", "authors": ["Zane Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
