We bet you are.\n\nDon't take it personally. Many people get a little lazy on vacation or prioritize their own relaxation and enjoyment over that of their shipmates. It's only natural to slack off when you get time off, but your actions \u2013 whether conscious or not \u2013 can negatively impact other cruisers and crew members.\n\nA little courtesy and self-awareness won't hurt, and they can go a long way in making your cruise ship a happy haven for all onboard. So if you're guilty of these terrible cruise habits pointed out by Cruise Critic, it's time to resolve to break yourself of them.\n\nDebunking 15 cruise myths: Yes, you can go on a cruise alone. No, not everyone is drunk\n\n1. Not washing your hands\n\nWho wants to take 20 seconds to thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water after using the bathroom when trivia is starting in just a few minutes? And why should the line for the hand-sanitizing spray slow down your descent on the buffet?\n\nTruth is, if you don't wash your hands before and after meals or when using the bathroom, you increase your risk of getting sick or spreading illness around the ship. Take the extra few seconds to help everyone have a healthier vacation.\n\nStay healthy while sailing: How not to get sick on a cruise\n\n2. Smoking on your balcony\n\nSmoking is a bad habit, but if you can't break it, at least respect ship rules about appropriate venues for lighting up.\n\nSmoking is banned on cruise ship balconies for two reasons: It's dangerous and creates a fire hazard, but the smoke also blows over to your neighbor's veranda, and they might not appreciate the air pollution when they've paid extra to get fresh air in their cabin. Note the deck areas and lounge areas that permit smoking and smoke in peace there.\n\nCruise line smoking policies: Where you can and can't light up\n\n3. Saving seats\n\nThis habit is as bad when you're hogging lounge chairs by the pool as it is when you're reserving a row of choice theater seats for your extended family who can't be bothered to arrive on time.\n\nEveryone deserves a fair shot at a good seat, and it's rude to think your group should get special treatment. Be courteous; if there's nobody in that chair, give it up to a shipmate who's just shown up.\n\nAdvice: How to outsmart deck chair hogs\n\n4. Overeating and drinking\n\nIt's so easy to be a glutton on a cruise. You pile your plate high at the buffet because everything looks so good, even if you can't possibly finish all that food. With a drink package, you can quickly lose track of whether you're on margarita 3 or 4, until you wake up in your cabin (or someone else's), not knowing how you got there.\n\nWhether it's for your own health, ending food waste or not ruining another's night with your drunken antics, try to curb your indulgence and eat and drink a more reasonable (but still vacation-friendly) amount.\n\nDon't be a glutton: 7 deadly sins of cruising and how to rise above them\n\n5. Leaving your balcony room door open and your cabin lights on\n\nWhen you're not at home (or paying the electricity bill), you quickly forget the life lessons your mama taught you. Turn out the lights when you leave a room. Don't leave windows (or, in this case, the balcony door) open when you're not enjoying the fresh air.\n\nYour carelessness costs the cruise ship because it wastes electricity, and when cruise lines have to pay, cruisers pay, too, in the form of increased base fares. Do everyone a favor, and close that door or flip that switch before you head out to the pool or ashore for the day.\n\nGreen Cruising: How these cruise lines are fighting climate change and pollution\n\n6. Touching food you don't take\n\nYou should always use tongs or other utensils to serve yourself food. But if you do reach for a bread roll or cupcake with your bare hands, for the love of god don't touch a piece of food and then put it back into the communal basket.\n\nBottom line: If you touch it, take it. If you mistakenly touch it, take it anyway. Better to waste a small amount of food than to spread norovirus or other germs in an enclosed environment.\n\n10 commandments of cruise buffet etiquette: What will get you dirty looks in the dining room\n\n7. Letting your kids run wild\n\nWe get it. You're on vacation and, therefore, want a vacation from parenting. If that's the case, don't cruise with your kids. If you choose to bring them, you'll need to parent them. That means it's your responsibility to manage their behavior in public areas, reprimanding them if they're too loud or too wild or disturbing other passengers.\n\nIf you are lazing the day away at the adults-only sun deck, make sure you have safely ensconced your offspring in the kids club \u2013 or read them the riot act and rules about where they can go and how to behave elsewhere on the ship.\n\nCalling Supernanny: How to control your kids at sea\n\n8. Leaving dirty dishes in the hallway\n\nt's somehow become a common practice to leave dirty dishes in passenger corridors or empty glasses wherever you happen to finish that beer. That doesn't make it OK.\n\nIf you order room service, call your cabin steward or room service team to pick up the tray from your room when you're finished, rather than leaving the tray on the floor outside your door. If you're drinking on the go, deposit the glass at the nearest bar. (There's always one close by.)\n\nRoom service: What to expect on a cruise\n\n9. Making a mess of your cabin\n\nWhile we're on the topic of mess, don't ransack your cabin and let your room steward deal with the aftermath. Dirty clothes go in a closet, a laundry bag or in your suitcase -- not on the floor. Cruise dailies and other papers should be piled neatly or trashed, not spread around every surface. Shoes go in a corner if they can't stay in the closet, not somewhere your steward can trip on them.\n\nWe're not saying you have to be a neat freak, but a few minutes of picking up each morning will have your hardworking cabin steward breathing a sigh of relief.\n\nHow not to be rude on a cruise: Ways to make the crew love you\n\n10. Being noisy\n\nAre you guilty of talking through theatrical performances, playing your own music loudly on serenity sun decks or blaring your cabin's TV at 2 a.m.? Please remember you're sharing the ship with thousands of other vacationers, and show a little consideration. Turn down the volume when other cruisers are trying to sleep, relax or pay attention to a show or lecture. There's always another venue or a set of headphones available for you.\n\nBad cruisers: What not to do in your cruise room\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2019/10/24/cruise-passengers-10-most-cringeworthy-habits-and-how-to-break-them/4074943002/", "description": "From hygiene issues to excessive noise and drinking, these bad habits will put you on everyone else's bad side.
