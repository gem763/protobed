Of course, plastic packaging can help keep the food hygienic, increases shelf-life and is easier to grab on the go, but it comes with numerous riders and at a great cost to the environment.\n\nOnce the vegetables and fruits are brought home, the packaging removed, it goes straight into the bin. There is no further use of it. But what is imperative to think is \u2013 was it useful at first place or could it have been avoided?\n\nThe plastic lifestyle has several hazardous consequences.\n\nIn the age of heightened consumerism, supermarkets have become a major source of single-use plastic and therefore, pollution.\n\nThe World Economic Forum warns that there will be more plastic than fish by weight in oceans by 2050, and given the current pace of consumption, this is no surprise.\n\nDon't Miss 11.8 K SHARES 1.1 K SHARES 1.1 K SHARES 359 SHARES 467 SHARES\n\nPlastic is choking our oceans, killing marine life and contaminating our daily lives. Still, we choose to let it dominate our shelves.\n\nGetty Images\n\nPlastic can take up to 1000 year to decompose. Each year, the world produces 300 million tonnes of plastic, half of which is single use. Eight million tonnes of plastic is dumped in the ocean every year. Studies and estimates suggest that close to 50 per cent of plastic is used just once and thrown away. Packaging is the largest end-use market segment accounting for just over 40 per cent of total plastic usage.\n\nAlso, one million bags are used every minute and these bags have a working life of merely 15 minutes.\n\nThese staggering facts are enough to act now and step-by-step eliminate plastic from our daily lives. But, we still are not doing the bare minimum.\n\nTaking charge\n\nHowever, small changes have begun.\n\nThe unassuming fruit sticker may seem an unlikely cause for environmental concern but removing it from produce could create huge savings in plastic, energy and CO2 emissions.\n\nIn a timely consumer demand for less packaging, Dutch fruit and veg supplier Nature & More and Swedish supermarket ICA have joined forces to run a trial to replace sticky labels on organic avocados and sweet potatoes with a laser mark.\n\nIn April 2018, Nestl\u00e9 committed to make 100 percent of its packaging reusable or recyclable by 2025.\n\nNestl\u00e9 CEO Mark Schneider said in the announcement, \"Plastic waste is one of the biggest sustainability issues the world is facing today. Tackling it requires a collective approach. We are committed to finding improved solutions to reduce, re-use and recycle.\"\n\nShutterstock\n\nFrom 2020 to 2025, Nestl\u00e9 will phase out all plastics that are not recyclable or are hard to recycle. And Nestl\u00e9 will significantly raise the percentage of recycled plastics used in its water bottle lines by 2025.\n\nIndia\u2019s war against plastic\n\nLike much of the world, India too, is struggling to dispose its growing quantities of plastic waste given how pervasive is has become. India generates close to 26,000 tonnes of plastic a day, according to a CPCB estimate from 2012. Worse, a little over 10,000 tonnes a day of plastic waste remains uncollected.\n\nThis uncollected waste eventually lands up in the natural environment. At less than 11 kg, India\u2019s per capita plastic consumption is nearly a tenth of the US, at 109 kg.\n\nWhile India has declared a war on plastic pollution, with prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s call to put an end to single-use plastic, a blanket ban on single-use plastic is not happening anytime soon as earlier expected. India would phase out single-use plastics by 2022 as committed by the government.\n\nSome plastic wrapping is a foolish waste and it\u2019s high time to work towards reducing the plastic footprint.\n\nRecycling and substitution is not going to solve the problem of plastic pollution. The need of the hour is to see a focused reduction of plastic production in the first place.", "description": "There\u2019s packaging and then there\u2019s over-packaging, and over-packaging is one of the needless trends in the world.
