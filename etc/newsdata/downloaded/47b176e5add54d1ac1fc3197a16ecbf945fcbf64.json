This could result in lost labour force productivity when/if the MAX does return to service. We have seen the consequences of such events in shipbuilding; it can be ugly,\" said Spingarn.\n\nUBS also downgraded Boeing's biggest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, to \"neutral\" from \"buy\" and cut its target price on the stock to $88 from $92, citing possible production cuts.", "description": "Boeing stock downgraded on Monday after reports surfaced that company employees may have misled US aviation regulator.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/11/21d1887e79ff4ff7973c56165d3adfb8_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
