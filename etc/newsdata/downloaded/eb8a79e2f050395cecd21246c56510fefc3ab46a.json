But one was definitely better than the other. Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nWith the recent launch of the Galaxy Fold, Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note10 series, Samsung fans looking to upgrade their phones now have a slew of new devices to choose from.\n\nAt S$3,088 and S$1,598, the two biggest and most expensive Samsung phones launched in recent months are the Galaxy Fold and the Galaxy Note10 Plus.\n\nI pit the two phones against each other for 24 hours to see which was the better buy \u2013 and was surprised when the more expensive Fold lost to the cheaper Note10 Plus.\n\nHere\u2019s how it went:\n\nThis is Samsung\u2019s much-awaited Galaxy Fold: a S$3,000 phone with a groundbreaking foldable screen and 6 camera lenses.\n\ncaption It has three lenses on the back, two on the foldable screen, and one on the front. source Samsung\n\nRead also: Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Fold is launching in Singapore on Sept 18 and costs S$3,088\n\nMeanwhile, this is the S$1,600 Note10 Plus. It comes with 4 cameras and the largest screen possible on a Samsung phone.\n\ncaption It\u2019s technically a phablet (phone/tablet) and has a stylus. source Samsung\n\nRead also: Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy Note10 comes in two sizes \u2013 and the S$1,600 version is its biggest phone screen ever\n\nWith both phones on loan from Samsung, I used them for 24 hours to see which was the better buy.\n\nI compared two major areas: screen experience and camera.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe Fold easily won the screen experience round, simply because of its luxurious 7.3-inch screen.\n\nAt 6.8 inches, the Note10 Plus\u2019 screen was huge, too. Just not as huge.\n\ncaption Watching videos on the bigger screen was super shiok. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe Fold was able to open three apps at once, while the Note10 Plus could do two.\n\ncaption It\u2019s great if you need to multitask, but I couldn\u2019t imagine using this feature often. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nBecause of the screen size, apps like Google Maps showed more information on the Fold, which could be useful for drivers.\n\ncaption If you can find a phone holder to fit, that is. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe Fold offered a much bigger calendar space to get organised with.\n\ncaption I know it\u2019s subtle, but I rely on this app daily and loved the space upgrade. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nSurfing the internet was also way easier on the eyes on the Fold\u2026\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 and the roomy keyboard was a blessing when replying emails.\n\ncaption Finally, keys not made for ants! source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nSince I\u2019m not a hardcore gamer, I stuck to playing childhood favourite Bejeweled \u2013 and enjoyed it more on the Fold\u2019s bigger screen.\n\ncaption Actual gamers will definitely appreciate the increased screen space. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nHowever, I had five things I didn\u2019t like about about the Fold\u2019s screen.\n\nFirst: a subtle but noticeable dip across the centre, which deeply bothered a friend who begged to try out the phone.\n\ncaption I get that it has to fold somewhere. Just know it might bother you. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe second: how thick and clunky the Fold was when \u2013 well \u2013 folded. It stuck out of my pocket, and the weight caused my shorts to sag.\n\ncaption The Note10 Plus was hefty too, but not quite as heavy. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThird, although the big screen was easy on the eyes, its square shape meant a lot of space was often wasted.\n\ncaption Most videos on YouTube and Netflix don\u2019t fill up square screens. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nFourth, some apps didn\u2019t show up correctly on the cover screen when I folded the phone mid-use. The screen was supposed to seamlessly continue showing whatever was happening previously on the main screen.\n\ncaption My Bejeweled game had parts of the interface cut off. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\n(For comparison, here\u2019s a successful demo of me switching screens for a YouTube video, though I don\u2019t think anyone will want to watch videos on the front screen.)\n\ncaption Unless it\u2019s embarrassing stuff you don\u2019t want half the MRT to watch with you. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nLast, despite the amazing screen, most videos were pixelated.\n\nThis had more to do with the video quality than the screen, but the bigger screen made the pixels more obvious.\n\ncaption Sorry, TSwift. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nWhen it came to cameras, the Note10 Plus won by a narrow margin. Given it had 2 fewer lenses than the Fold, I was very surprised.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nAt first, it seemed the Fold had an obvious advantage, as the large main screen made it easier to see subjects, and enjoy the pictures afterwards.\n\ncaption Great for older people, like mums, dads, and grandparents. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\n(However, the same couldn\u2019t be said of its cover screen.)\n\ncaption I felt like I\u2019d gone back to the early 2000s. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nNevertheless, both of its selfie lenses did comparably.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nFor wide angle shots, the Fold produced pictures with better lighting, sharper contrast, and punchier colours than the Note10.\n\ncaption This can, however, be fixed in an editing app. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe same thing happened with food shots.\n\ncaption But not everyone will be a fan of the Fold\u2019s saturated colours. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nBoth phones did similarly for medium shots\u2026\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\n\u2026night shots\u2026\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 and low light shots.\n\ncaption Samsung\u2019s low light sensor was fantastic in general. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nI liked the effect from the Note10 Plus better on Pro mode, even though both phones had the exact same settings.\n\ncaption I tried for a film-like effect. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe biggest difference between the phones were the zoom shots. The Fold\u2019s photos were far more blurry.\n\ncaption Just look at those tree leaves. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nThe Fold did badly with close up shots as well, which also turned out blurry.\n\ncaption Unlike the Note10 Plus\u2019 colour and contrast issues, this cannot be easily fixed. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nAll things considered, the Fold seemed at first like the slightly better phone.\n\nThe biggest draw was definitely its huge screen, which made activities like watching videos and typing way more enjoyable. I felt like my eyes would thank me in the long run.\n\nThe downsides? A clunky and heavy device (when closed), and sub-par zoom shots.\n\ncaption It\u2019s definitely a great device for people who don\u2019t own a tablet and want a bigger-than-average phone screen. source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nBut once I factored the Fold\u2019s eye-watering price tag, the Note10 Plus immediately became the more value-for-money option, especially because the camera was a tad better.\n\nSure, you won\u2019t get the bragging rights of a foldable screen, but the phone was decently large, came with a stylus, and costs around half of what the Fold does.\n\ncaption source Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Surprisingly, the cheaper phone was the better buy..
