However, some implants don't work as intended, especially for people with damage to the inner ear or auditory nerve.\n\nIn such a scenario, electric signals are required to be sent directly to the auditory brainstem with the help of an Auditory Brainstem Implant or ABI. However, even while doing this the results are mixed and doesn't always result in a positive outcome as these ABIs are not as soft as one would want and doesn't curve appropriately near the auditory stem, thus losing necessary contact.\n\nHowever, researchers at EPFL's Laboratory for Soft BioElectronic Interface (LSBI), in collaboration with clinicians from Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts Eye and Ear have developed a soft electronic implant which is highly elastic and curves perfectly to the surface of the auditory brainstem.\n\nDon't Miss 7.9 K SHARES 7.2 K SHARES 5.2 K SHARES 1.8 K SHARES 903 SHARES\n\nThe flexible ABI consists of an array of platinum electrodes encased in silicone. However, platinum is a rigid material and one cannot truly bend it without damaging it. To circumvent this, the researchers adopted an ancient Japanese paper-cutting technique called Kirigami, where a y-shaped pattern is etched on to the metal that allows stretchability.\n\nEPFL\n\nTesting on mice has shown positive results and now the researchers have also produced the implant perfect for human use. This implant, even though is far from ready to be used on any human, is fully compatible with surgical procedures that are practised today, and also with imaging techniques like MRIs.\n\nThis implant is not just applicable for people suffering from hearing loss. St\u00e9phanie Lacour said in a statement, \"The properties of our device would be of value for all sorts of implantable neuroprosthetics, such as those used to stimulate or record neural activity in the spine, brain or even peripheral nerves.\"", "description": "Scientists at EPFL's Laboratory for Soft BioElectronic Interface have created new kind of flexible auditory brainstem implant to make people suffering from hearing loss and deafness hear again.
