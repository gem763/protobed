U.S. officials worry that Iran-backed forces in Syria could also capitalize on the chaos.\n\nAmid fears that Islamic State could stage a comeback, Trump said on Wednesday a small number of U.S. troops would remain in the area of Syria \u201cwhere they have the oil,\u201d a reference to oilfields in the Kurdish-controlled region.\n\nAny significant U.S. military presence on the ground would need to be properly defended from potential attack, particularly in oil-rich areas of Syria that could become targets of not just Islamic State militants but potentially, Russian-backed or Iran-backed forces operating in the country.\n\nRepublican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, who had been highly critical of Trump\u2019s initial withdrawal, told reporters on Thursday: \u201cThere\u2019s a plan coming together from the Joint Chiefs that I think may work, that may give us what we need to prevent ISIS from coming back, Iran taking the oil, ISIS from taking the oil.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am somewhat encouraged that a plan is coming about that will meet our core objectives in Syria,\u201d he said after a briefing from the Joint Chiefs chairman at the White House.\n\nThe U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who include Kurdish militia that Ankara sees as terrorists, had cleared the region from Islamic State control and has been detaining perhaps as many as 11,000 of the militants.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is committed to reinforcing our position, in coordination with our SDF partners, in northeast Syria with additional military assets to prevent those oilfields from falling back to into the hands of ISIS or other destabilizing actors,\u201d the first official said.", "description": "The United States is committed to reinforcing its military position in Syria with additional assets to prevent oilfields from being taken over by remnants of the Islamic State militant group or others, a U.S. defense official said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Phil Stewart", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444682046&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O00W", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
