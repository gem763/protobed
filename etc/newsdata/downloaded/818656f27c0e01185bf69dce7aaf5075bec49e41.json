REUTERS/Carlos Jasso/File Photo\n\nAmazon\u2019s fourth-quarter cost for one-day shipping will be nearly double the $800 million the company spent during the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters. The company began rolling out free one-day delivery with no minimum purchase early in the second quarter.\n\nCarriers like United Parcel Service Inc charge more for faster delivery, but that is only one component of the cost increase at Amazon, which ships around 10 billion packages per year.\n\nAnother is \u201cforegone shipping revenue,\u201d Olsavsky said.\n\n\u201cNow that it is free, people don\u2019t pay to get product in one day,\u201d he said. Before, \u201cyou had to pay an additional fee to get one day or faster\u201d shipping.\n\nLogistics experts, who noted that volumes surge during the holiday season, took Amazon\u2019s shipping cost forecast in stride.\n\n\u201cThat is to be expected,\u201d said ShipMatrix founder Satish Jindel, who added that Amazon saw a similar spike in costs when it rolled out free two-day shipping for Prime members in 2005.\n\nAmazon\u2019s volume increases 50-60% in the fourth quarter versus the second quarter, and more packages mean higher costs, Jindel said.\n\nBased on the guidance and historical trends, Amazon\u2019s fourth-quarter shipping costs \u201cwill easily surpass $10 billion, perhaps coming close to $11 billion,\u201d said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of Logistics Trends & Insights.\n\nThat will be felt on Amazon\u2019s bottom line, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note.\n\n\u201cSignificant investments tied to the rollout of one-day shipping will depress Q4 profits,\u201d Sebastian wrote.\n\nOlsavsky\u2019s comments came on the heels of Amazon\u2019s third-quarter earnings report, where the company said overall shipping costs surged 46% in the third quarter.\n\nAmazon spent $9.61 billion on shipping in the third quarter, up from $6.57 billion the year earlier.\n\n\u201cCustomers love the transition of Prime from two days to one day \u2014 they\u2019ve already ordered billions of items with free one-day delivery this year. It\u2019s a big investment, and it\u2019s the right long-term decision for customers,\u201d Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nAmazon recently made low-cost items like deodorant, bars of soap and dental floss eligible for free shipping - contributing to its costs.\n\n\u201cWhether all the extra investment will be worth it in the end is perhaps open to question, especially given the lacklustre sales guidance for next quarter,\u201d said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon\u2019s faster shipping push is boosting the Next Day delivery business at UPS.", "description": "Amazon.com Inc's chief financial officer on Thursday said costs for its one-day shipping program will spike to around $1.5 billion during the holiday season as the online retailer speeds up free delivery to woo shoppers and fend off rivals like Walmart Inc and Target Corp.", "authors": ["Lisa Baertlein", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444670503&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N25I", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
