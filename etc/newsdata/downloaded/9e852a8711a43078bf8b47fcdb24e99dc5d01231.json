The answer, according to a judge in a recent case, seems to be \u201cnot necessarily\u201d.\n\nThe right to sex, versus the right to safely decline sex has always been a seemingly thorny path for many of our lawmakers. The latest case, overseen by Mrs Justice Roberts, has found that an autistic man with impaired cognition, \u201cJB\u201d, has a fundamental right to sex \u2013 even if it involves a woman who is similarly disadvantaged and therefore unable to grant (or withdraw) consent.\n\nJB, 36, is unable to understand consent, and therefore it\u2019s been deemed that he shouldn\u2019t be held legally responsible for potentially crossing that line.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously a delicate matter and does warrant discussion given the nature of JB\u2019s disabilities and his desire to be in a happy, sexually fulfilling relationship \u2013 something many of us take for granted. It must be very frustrating to feel the same desires as most people and yet not be able, through no fault of his own, to understand and implement concepts that \u2013 let\u2019s be honest, many men without JB\u2019s disadvantages struggle with too.\n\nBut how can it be justifiable to agree that an individual who poses a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d of sexually offending against women can be given carte blanche to do so? Surely in today\u2019s society there are ways for a man to satisfy his sexuality without the threat of rape?\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I mean, the judge is actually saying that even if he has sex without consent (which under any law is rape) he cannot be found guilty of committing a crime \u2013 so strong is his right.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of view you might expect in a comments section of a right-wing paper, but surely there\u2019s no place for it in court.\n\nI can only conclude that Mrs Justice Roberts doesn\u2019t know many survivors of rape. As Vice Chair of Peterborough Rape Crisis Care Group, and founder of Survivor Stories (a website featuring interviews with survivors of sexual violence in their own words) I do. And I\u2019m yet to meet a man whose thwarted desire for sex has lead to him self-harming, attempting suicide or undergoing decades of harrowing flashbacks.\n\nI\u2019ve met women who have been unable to trust, who have given up on their dreams of becoming mothers because they can\u2019t imagine forming a healthy relationship. Those who have left jobs, university courses and relationships because of the after-effects of sexual violence.\n\nOf course it isn\u2019t only women who are raped \u2013 what a mixed message to send male survivors, suggesting that another man\u2019s sex drive is a higher priority than his own ability to refuse consent.\n\nAnd all that is without examining possibly the most disturbing element of this new case \u2013 the judge\u2019s acknowledgement that it\u2019s highly likely that the women JB has the potential to assault will be vulnerable themselves. While it might be a damaging message to a disabled man that he may need to consider other options sexually, surely it\u2019s much more damaging to suggest to a disabled woman that it\u2019s perfectly legal for her to be abused, and that she wouldn\u2019t even have the protection of the court in the event of her rape?\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to be reminded of another case which saw a judge ruling that a man had a \u201cfundamental human right\u201d to have sex with his wife who has learning difficulties. Both cases feel like rulings that men\u2019s rights are higher up the pecking order than women\u2019s, and that disadvantaged women in particular are afforded no protection at all.", "description": "Do women \u2013 in particular vulnerable women \u2013 have the right not to be raped?
