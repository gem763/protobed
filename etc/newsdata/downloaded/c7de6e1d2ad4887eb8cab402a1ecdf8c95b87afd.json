They can follow logical processes, learn sign language and play computer games.\n\nNeuroscientists at Emory University found that pigs can solve problems as well as chimpanzees. Even a slaughterman who killed pigs for a living said: \u201cI reckon they got more sense than we have.\u201d\n\nExperts say that pigs have huge emotional depth: they display trust, empathy, forgiveness, grief, fear, sorrow and joy. In one study they were observed displaying empathy for others who were happy or stressed.\n\nPigs can dream and sing. In the wild they like to chase each other, play-fight, and roll down hills for fun. They show loyalty, and can remember someone they met as long as three years previously.\n\nBacon, though.\n\nThese wonderful animals have often saved people\u2019s lives. A pig called Priscilla rescued a mentally challenged boy who was drowning in Texas\u2019s Lake Somerville by swimming him to safety as he held onto her collar. A pig called Lucky saved a woman and her two grandchildren by waking them as their Illinois home began to burn down.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, a pig called Lulu saved the life of her owner, who had suffered a heart attack in her trailer. Lulu scraped her way out of the home and lay down in the road, bringing traffic to a standstill. When a driver got out of his car, Lulu led him back into the home, where an ambulance was called.\n\nWhat love they show us \u2013 and what wickedness we show them in return. In intensive factory farms, sows are artificially inseminated over and over. The majority of sows reared in Britain are kept in metal crates just centimetres bigger than their bodies.\n\nEven in farms with higher welfare standards, little piglets have their ears punctured, teeth clipped and tails cut without anaesthetic. On some farms, piglets who grow too slowly are killed by being slammed headfirst onto concrete floors. This standard industry practice is called \u201cthumping\u201d.\n\nAround 86 per cent of pigs slaughtered for food in the UK are killed in gas chambers. Yes, gas chambers. As Jane Dalton\u2019s recent long read for The Independent revealed, pigs \u201cscream in pain and gasp for breath while the gas acidifies their eyes, nostrils, mouths and lungs,\u201d and \u201cscramble to try to escape, panicking and in distress\u201d before they \u201cliterally burn from the inside out\u201d.\n\nBacon, though.\n\nThe human race\u2019s complex relationship with pigs was shown in 1998, when two pigs escaped from an abattoir in Wiltshire, swam a river and ran off.\n\nThe pigs \u2013 Butch and her brother Sundance \u2013 spent a week on the run. They were dubbed the Tamworth Two and became a media sensation. Over 100 journalists drove to the south-west to search for them in muddy woods. Television crews hovered above in helicopters.\n\nThe pigs were mentioned in parliament and on Radio 4\u2019s Thought for the Day. When their owner said that once they were found he would take them back to the slaughterhouse, there was a public outcry. These national heroes were eventually rehomed at a sanctuary. Sundance lived to be 14 years old.\n\nThe saga captured what scientists call cognitive dissonance. Most of the people cheering on the Tamworth Two were meat eaters. The same people tucked into pork chops or bacon sandwiches straight afterwards. But the thought of those two pigs getting killed still upset them.\n\nIt\u2019s the same with pigs in popular culture. Peppa Pig and the piggy star of the movie Babe capture the hearts of all who watch. But what sort of love is it? Most of the same kids who are captivated by Peppa and her friends are also fed the flesh of other pigs \u2013 pigs that have had a hellish life and terrifying death. What would Peppa say?\n\nAs the vegan market rockets, there are now vegan sausages and bacon rashers that are just as good as their meat equivalents. I get that people love bacon. But if you can get the same salty taste and mouthfeel without hurting and killing a pig, wouldn\u2019t that be better all round?", "description": "Vegans like me seem to unsettle a lot of meat-eaters, particularly around the dinner table.
