Risk appetite received a further boost on Monday morning when the European Union confirmed that it had offered the U.K. a three-month extension to the deadline for Brexit, definitively removing the risk of a disorderly rupture on Oct. 31.\n\nBy 7:26 AM ET (1226 GMT), the contract was at 3028.62, up 8 points, or 0.4%, from late Friday in New York. It hit its previous record high of 3,029.5 on July 26.\n\nThe contract was up 0.4% at 26,997, still short of its all-time high of 27,397.0.", "description": "NewsBreak: S&P 500 Futures at New Record High on Trade Hope, Brexit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB301JO_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
