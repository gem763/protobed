Now that he\u2019s resigned -- and WeWork\u2019s new co-CEOs are looking to make changes -- scrutiny is turning to his inner circle.\n\nWeWork Vice Chairman Michael Gross, Vice President of Operations and Special Projects Zvika Shachar and Director of Development Roni Bahar are longtime WeWork executives who were seen internally as divisive figures with strong personal connections to the former CEO, according to current and former employees. Shachar is a childhood friend of Neumann, and Gross helped lead some of WeWork\u2019s early fundraising rounds.\n\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s shakeup, and with an initial public offering delayed, WeWork\u2019s new leaders are turning a critical eye on the company. \u201cWe will closely review all aspects of our company with the intention of strengthening our core business and improving our management and operations,\u201d co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham wrote in an email to employees. \u201cWe anticipate difficult decisions ahead.\u201d\n\nThe increased attention will include examining the roles of some of Neumann\u2019s close associates, said two of the employees, who asked not to be named because the details are confidential. WeWork declined to comment.\n\nRead more about WeWork\u2019s new leaders here.\n\nWithin WeWork\u2019s fast and loose culture, where tequila shots sometimes flowed after all-hands meetings, the three confidants often partied with Neumann in work settings and beyond, according to the employees.\n\nThe employees said Shachar and Bahar flew with Neumann on a Gulfstream private jet last year when the crew found marijuana hidden in a cereal box on the plane, an episode reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal. Shachar and Bahar did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\nWeWork also paid Gross\u2019s parents as brokers on a deal for a building in Miami, the two employees also said. Gross did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWeWork\u2019s IPO, through which it hoped to raise $3 billion and access $6 billion more in credit, went up in flames this month over concern about the company\u2019s valuation, its unusual corporate governance, and Neumann\u2019s management style and personal behavior. His ouster mirrors that of Travis Kalanick, who was Uber\u2019s famously aggressive co-founder and CEO until he was forced out by the board ahead of a public listing. Some of Kalanick\u2019s close associates left around the time he stepped down in 2017.\n\nWeWork is continuing to work toward an IPO, though it is likely postponed until 2020, according to people familiar with the matter. As part of its efforts to salvage the offering, the company is weighing job cuts and shedding or spinning out non-core businesses, those people said. Eliminated positions would number in the thousands, one person said.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Ellen Huet in San Francisco at ehuet4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Alistair Barr at abarr18@bloomberg.net, Molly Schuetz\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- As chief executive officer of WeWork, Adam Neumann had a close group of friends who\u00a0worked for him at the co-working giant.
