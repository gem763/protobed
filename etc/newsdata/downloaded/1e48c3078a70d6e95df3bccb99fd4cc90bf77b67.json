It\u2019s treason pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death,\u201d Weld told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. \u201cThat\u2019s the only penalty.\u201d\n\nWeld made the shocking statement in a joint appearance with fellow GOP presidential challengers Joe Walsh and Mark Sanford, who are protesting state Republican parties that have decided to cancel primaries to give the edge to the sitting president.\n\n\u201cObviously, canceling primaries undermines democratic institutions and democratic elections, but that\u2019s far from the deepest dive crime that the president has committed here,\u201d Weld said, referring to the growing calls for clarification about Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine and the withholding of military funds in the weeks before a July 25 call in which he admitted to discussing an investigation of Hunter Biden.\n\nRebecca Cook/Reuters More\n\nBiden\u2019s son had business dealings in Ukraine at the same time then-Vice President Biden was tasked with overseeing the Obama administration\u2019s Ukraine policy. Trump made the call when he already knew Biden would challenge him in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cHe has now acknowledged that in a single phone call right after he suspended $250 million of military aid to Ukraine, he called up the president of Ukraine and pressed him eight times to investigate Joe Biden, who the president thinks is going to be running against him,\u201d Weld said.\n\n\u201cTalk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election.\u201d\n\nThe death penalty is the maximum punishment for treason, but federal law also allows for lesser sentences including five-year prison terms or fines starting at $10,000. The law also states that treasonous acts can prohibit one from holding public office.\n\n\u201cThe penalty on the Constitution is removal from office,\u201d Weld said. \u201cAnd that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he can work out a plea deal.\u201d\n\nWeld then backed off calls for executing the president, but only slightly.\n\n\u201cThe grounds for removal of office, impeachment, are treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about bribery anymore, we don\u2019t have to worry about other high crimes and misdemeanors, although I think he committed many. We have treason and we can go right for the hoop.\u201d\n\nWeld\u2019s fellow guests did not immediately weigh in on calls for the death penalty for the president. Weld then called on fellow Republicans, especially those facing re-election for congressional seats, to speak out. \u201cIf they won\u2019t say this is a bridge too far for us, then they really have no chance at the ballot box next year, not just President Trump but those members of the Senate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s well past time for this guy, in my opinion, to be carted off to save us all,\u201d Weld said. \u201cHe\u2019s daring us all to let him be totally lawless. He has no respect for the law, he has no knowledge base under any issues. Why do we want this man as president of the United States? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
