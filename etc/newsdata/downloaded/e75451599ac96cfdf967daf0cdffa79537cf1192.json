The Washington Post cited the \u201cGOP\u2019s cowardice problem\u201d over a year ago, as did Salon, which asked, \u201cWhen did the GOP add cowardice to its platform?\u201d Earlier this year, House Judiciary Chairman Adam Schiff declared there was an \u201cepidemic of cowardice\u201d among Republicans who did not push back against Mr. Trump.\n\nSuch criticism appears to have had an effect on the Grand Old Party, and it could cost them. Republican voters have noticed, and are vexed by GOP lawmakers who appear to appease Democrats by not standing fast with President Trump as he faces impeachment. These Republicans are taking the inaction personally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely ticking me off now. I\u2019m to the point where I want to start calling my senator and say, \u2018I\u2019m not going vote for you unless you promise to do this to the next Democratic president. I\u2019m done with what\u2019s happening to Trump on a chronic basis,\u2019\u201d one listener told Rush Limbaugh on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cYou are so right about this. And all these Never Trumpers, they are falling into it like the biggest useful idiots. If these so-called conservative media outlets continue to publish all of these unhinged Trump\u2019s got to go pieces, Trump\u2019s got to get impeached, we need to get rid of Trump, all they\u2019re doing is accelerating the left-wing takeover of the whole country,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh replied, adding that GOP lawmakers do not appear to be on their game.\n\n\u201cOur so-called representatives are constantly on defense, never advancing the ball, never trying,\u201d he declared.\n\nMEDIA SINS OF OMISSION\n\n\u201cToo often, the media ignore President Trump\u2019s outreach to racial minorities. The major networks maintain silence in hopes that their socially corrosive lies will stick until November 2020. At least three significant events demonstrate how the big media bury Trump\u2019s bridge-building and, thus, keep the U.S. in a divided, racially explosive rage,\u201d writes National Review columnist Deroy Murdock.\n\nHe cites Mr. Trump\u2019s salute last month to 50,000 immigrants from India and Americans of Indian descent \u2014 a significant event which received no coverage whatsoever from NBC, CBS and ABC, which instead focused on a movie, a lost dog and football, respectively.\n\nMr. Trump also appeared at the 2019 Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week Conference in September.\n\n\u201cHere, too, all three evening-news shows entombed this story,\u201d Mr. Murdock said, noting that ABC covered the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders doubling their pay, CBS featured the medical benefits of naps, while NBC showcased a 9-year-old Ohioan who was \u201clunch-shamed\u201d at school.\n\nThe columnist was also annoyed by the media\u2019s absence following Mr. Trump\u2019s call to end anti-Semitism during a National Day of Prayer ceremony at the White House this year.\n\n\u201cNone of the three big networks spared a moment to report on the president rallying the republic against anti-Semitism,\u201d says Mr. Murdock. \u201cRather than give Americans all this news, and confirm that President Trump is neither anti-immigrant, nor anti-black, nor anti-Semitic, the Big Three maintain a sarcophagal silence in hopes that their \u2018Trump is a racist\u2019 lies will stick until November 2020. This is evil.\u201d\n\nA SUPREME COURT PREVIEW\n\nAn event of note on Wednesday: The Federalist Society will host its 2019 Supreme Court Preview at a historic hotel a few blocks north of the White House. Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network, and SCOTUSblog columnist Amy Howe are among the participants.\n\n\u201cThe Court\u2019s docket already includes major cases involving criminal law, sex discrimination, copyright, DACA and immigration, federal Indian law, and matters of constitutional structure,\u201d the organizers point out.\n\nThe event begins at noon \u2014 and yes, C-SPAN will be covering it.\n\nTHE IMPEACHMENT REALITY CHECK\n\nThe current news media strategy is to alarm the American public with drama and innuendo which leaves the impression that there is wrongdoing in the Trump administration, and soon, the wheels will come off. This media maneuver has been around for a while. Consider that Politico published an analysis headlined \u201cCould Trump be impeached shortly after he takes office?\u201d on April 17, 2016 \u2014 seven months before President Trump was even elected.\n\nAll that aside, here is a fact-driven analysis from Monmouth University which has been tracking impeachment trends for two years.\n\n\u201cAt this time, 44% of Americans feel that Trump should be impeached and compelled to leave the presidency, while 52% disagree with this course of action,\u201d reports Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.\n\n\u201cYes, support for impeachment has increased over the last week, but it\u2019s not significantly higher than where it has been at other points in Trump\u2019s presidency. At least not yet,\u201d Mr. Murray says, noting that the impeachment support has inched up in increments \u2014 in contrast to President Nixon, who faced jolting jumps in pro-impeachment sentiment in 1973.\n\nFOXIFIED\n\nFox News now marks an unprecedented 71 consecutive quarters as the most watched cable news channel of all according to Nielsen \u2014 this amounts to almost 18 years in first place. And the numbers: Fox News attracts a prime-time audience of 2.4 million viewers, compared to MSNBC 1.6 million and CNN with 883,000.\n\nIt is of note that while the number of Fox News prime-time viewers dropped by 1% last week, the number fell by 18% on MSNBC.\n\nOf the top five programs in cable news, four are on Fox News: \u201cHannity\u201d (3.3 million), \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d (3 million), MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show\u201d (2.6 million), \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d (2.7 million), and \u201cThe Five\u201d (2.6 million).\n\nFox News also has signed political pollster, Washington Examiner columnist and commentator Kristen Soltis Anderson as a contributor; she debuted on the network Tuesday.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 52% of Americans say President Trump should not be impeached and \u201ccompelled to leave the presidency\u201d; 89% of Republicans, 53% of independents and 17% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 77% of conservatives, 46% of moderates, 19% of liberals, 61% of men and 43% of women also agree.\n\n\u2022 43% overall say it is a \u201cbad idea\u201d for the House Judiciary Committee to conduct an impeachment inquiry; 80% of Republicans, 43% of independents and 13% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 68% of conservatives, 35% of moderates, 15% of liberals agree, 51% of men and 36% of women also agree.\n\nSource: A Monmouth University poll of 1,161 U.S. adults conducted Sept. 23-29.\n\n\u2022 Kindly follow Jennifer Harper on Twitter @HarperBulletin\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
