So take advantage of your next flight to kick back and binge a really good podcast. Our pals at Lifehacker US put together a list of recommendations for the best podcasts to download en masse before you take off:\n\nJoel Kahn, Senior Video Producer\n\nSong Exploder is perfect for plane rides of any length. Even though the episodes are short (around 20 minutes), you can then extend the life of the episode by listening to an entire album by the artist interviewed, now with new insights. Since there are so many episodes, you can prep and download the ones featuring only the artists you like, and their entire discographies as well.\n\nNick Douglas, Staff Writer\n\nI spend flights in a half-unconscious haze, and a good soundtrack for that is the gentle narration of LeVar Burton, who reads classic (but not overplayed) short stories on the efficiently named podcast LeVar Burton Reads. His voice and his excitement for literature is exactly how you remember it from Reading Rainbow. There are 48 episodes so far, ranging from 30 to 60 minutes each\n\nMeghan Walbert, Contributing Writer\n\nI\u2019ve been binging Terrible, Thanks for Asking. It is admittedly sad because it\u2019s largely about people working through the grief of something difficult that happened to them, but the host, Nora McInerny, has a dry sense of humour and big laugh that somehow lightens up the mood. It\u2019s great interviewing and storytelling and a 40-minute episode goes by incredibly fast.\n\nDavid Murphy, Senior Tech Editor\n\nI always love the soothing sounds of This American Life. However, I\u2019m also a big fan of D&D-themed podcasts like Acquisitions Incorporated, the \u201cC\u201d Team, or Critical Role \u2014 to me, it\u2019s a kind of interactive storytelling that lets me kill time and tap into my inner geek without having to get $80 worth of books, a little figurine and friends.\n\nVirginia Smith, Managing Editor\n\nThe Bowery Boys has an endless number of bite-sized episodes with snapshots of New York History, from events to neighbourhoods to specific people to specific buildings. I find it equal parts entertaining and soothing.\n\n\ufeffLisa Rowan, Personal Finance Writer\n\nI like to catch up on Criminal when I\u2019m travelling. Episodes are typically 30-40 minutes, with engrossing storytelling and memorable characters. Some of the episodes can be too gruesome for your travel time when you\u2019re just trying to relax, but those always have a warning on the front of the episode. Start with The Stowaway for a fun travel episode about a not-really criminal.\n\nBeth Skwarecki, Health Editor\n\nFor a flight, I like podcasts that exist in short series with an arc and an end. The Dream is an 11-episode series about the world of multi-level marketing, and each episode takes you a little further down the rabbit hole. Oh No Ross and Carrie also fits the bill: their \u201cinvestigations\u201d of paranormal phenomena and pseudoscience hucksters range from single episodes to epics: they made it through nine on Scientology, for example, before they got kicked out.\n\nMelissa Kirsch, Editor-in-Chief\n\nListen to Root of Evil! It\u2019s a true crime podcast hosted by two sisters who have every reason to believe their great-grandfather was the Black Dahlia Killer. It\u2019s horrifying and sad and gross and suspenseful and will make you forget you are in the middle seat.\n\nAlice Bradley, Deputy Editor\n\nEveryone should listen to all of Hit Parade, in which host Chris Molanphy goes deeper than you can imagine on the songs that have catapulted to the top of the charts. I have loved every episode, including the ones about artists I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d want to hear much about. And where I did love the artist whose songs he explored, I was enraptured.\n\nAbu Zafar, Video Producer\n\nThe best podcast to binge on a long flight is Surviving Y2K. Dan Taberski is a masterful storyteller, and he presents the hysteria around the Y2K through the stories of people who lived through it. A terrifying hostage situation, a cunning businessman, the birth of the first baby of the new millennium, and Taberski\u2019s own heartfelt story all weave together to paint a picture of what it must have felt like to believe the world would end at the turn of the century.\n\nMichelle Woo, Parenting Editor\n\nIf you\u2019re on vacation, you want to read/watch/listen to stuff that\u2019s outside of your everyday playlist, which is why I wholeheartedly recommend My Dad Wrote a Porno (if you haven\u2019t binged it already). A guy\u2019s dad wrote an amateur erotic novel, and he reads it with his friends. You will never regret entering the saga of Belinda Blinked.", "description": "It\u2019s rare in this world to have several hours to yourself, with nobody expecting you to be connected to the internet and an almost-comfortable chair to lounge in.
