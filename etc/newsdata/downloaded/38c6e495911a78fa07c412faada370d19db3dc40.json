The ones who did get jobs, she writes, were subject to harassment. She says Rose was verbally abusive to her on a daily basis, berating her about her weight, and that he frequently swatted away her hand while she worked, and once \u201cforcefully grabbed and twisted her arm, physically hurting her.\u201d The show was canceled in November 2017, after the Washington Post reported that eight women accused him of harassment and assault. The reported tally eventually rose to at least 35 women.\n\nRose is already fighting a sexual-harassment suit brought by three young former assistants: Sydney McNeal, Chelsea Wei, and Brooks Harris. (CBS News, which employed Rose as an anchor and correspondent, settled with them last December.) Riggi says she saw Rose be \u201chandsy\u201d and comment on the looks of the same women, who she says often complained to her.\n\nRiggi says she frequently witnessed Rose inappropriately touching and ogling his female employees, including \u201cholding a female intern on his lap.\u201d At a pool party at his house in Bellport, the younger female employees didn\u2019t want to get in the pool because, they said, he was watching them from the second floor.\n\nTwo unnamed assistants allegedly told Riggi they received unwanted late-night phone calls from Rose. He allegedly asked one \u201cwhether she had a boyfriend and inquired about her love life.\u201d Riggi also describes a personal assistant who said she met Rose at a BMW dealership in Manhattan and claims that in exchange for employment at the show, an apartment, and the use of a car and credit card, \u201cMr. Rose asked her to have sex with him and give him massages.\u201d\n\nRiggi\u2019s suit is the first to name Bloomberg LP, where Rose\u2019s PBS show was filmed, and which aired the show on its cable channel, as a defendant. Riggi argues that Bloomberg illegally misclassified her employment status and that she was actually their employee rather than an independent contractor. She also says Bloomberg received \u201cnumerous complaints\u201d about Rose, including when Riggi complained about the arm-twisting, and that in some cases, supervisors themselves were harassed. In November 2017, the company told my co-reporter and me for a Washington Post story that they had no records of any complaint, and a Bloomberg spokesman told the Cut today that the company stands by that statement. \u201cWe understand that the plaintiff was a contractor of Charlie Rose Inc., and given that they operated independently of us, any of her compensation would have been handled solely by Charlie Rose Inc.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Rose, Jonathan Bach, said \u201cMr. Rose vehemently denies and will vigorously contest these allegations. Among other things, the allegations in the complaint are completely inconsistent with written statements made by the plaintiff to Mr. Rose, including \u2018I love working for you at your show, and would love to be part of any show that you host,\u2019 \u2018I consider it an honor to be a member of your team,\u2019 and \u2018hope to see you more often! Please stop by anytime.\u2019\u201d (The messages, he said, were sent between 2010 and 2012.) In response, Riggi\u2019s lawyer Patrick Walsh said, \u201cMs. Riggi\u2019s complaint details decades of unrelenting abuse to her and her co-workers. It is unfortunate that, to this day, the Defendants, including Mr. Rose, do not appreciate the gravity of his conduct and the damage it has done to those who endured it. We look forward to proving all of the allegations in court.\u201d\n\nIn the suit, Riggi recalls watching Rose interview Tina Brown about Harvey Weinstein after he was accused of assault and harassment. \u201cOne of the women commented, to general assent, that Mr. Rose was the wrong person to be conducting this interview.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
