For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune. But while history lauds those rare successes, those that fail are often forgotten; who remembers Pets.com?\n\nSo, the natural question for Candente Gold (CVE:CDG) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. For the purpose of this article, we'll define cash burn as the amount of cash the company is spending each year to fund its growth (also called its negative free cash flow). We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Candente Gold\n\nWhen Might Candente Gold Run Out Of Money?\n\nA cash runway is defined as the length of time it would take a company to run out of money if it kept spending at its current rate of cash burn. In June 2019, Candente Gold had US$3.4k in cash, and was debt-free. In the last year, its cash burn was US$201k. So it seems to us it had a cash runway of less than two months from June 2019. It's extremely surprising to us that the company has allowed its cash runway to get that short! The image below shows how its cash balance has been changing over the last few years.\n\nTSXV:CDG Historical Debt, October 30th 2019 More\n\nHow Is Candente Gold's Cash Burn Changing Over Time?\n\nCandente Gold didn't record any revenue over the last year, indicating that it's an early stage company still developing its business. Nonetheless, we can still examine its cash burn trajectory as part of our assessment of its cash burn situation. Over the last year its cash burn actually increased by 16%, which suggests that management are increasing investment in future growth, but not too quickly. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but investors should be mindful of the fact that will shorten the cash runway. Candente Gold makes us a little nervous due to its lack of substantial operating revenue. So we'd generally prefer stocks from this list of stocks that have analysts forecasting growth.\n\nCan Candente Gold Raise More Cash Easily?\n\nSince its cash burn is moving in the wrong direction, Candente Gold shareholders may wish to think ahead to when the company may need to raise more cash. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).\n\nSince it has a market capitalisation of CA$1.6m, Candente Gold's US$201k in cash burn equates to about 16% of its market value. As a result, we'd venture that the company could raise more cash for growth without much trouble, albeit at the cost of some dilution.\n\nHow Risky Is Candente Gold's Cash Burn Situation?\n\nOn this analysis of Candente Gold's cash burn, we think its cash burn relative to its market cap was reassuring, while its cash runway has us a bit worried. Once we consider the metrics mentioned in this article together, we're left with very little confidence in the company's ability to manage its cash burn, and we think it will probably need more money. For us, it's always important to consider risks around cash burn rates. But investors should look at a whole range of factors when researching a new stock. For example, it could be interesting to see how much the Candente Gold CEO receives in total remuneration.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Just because a business does not make any money, does not mean that the stock will go down.
