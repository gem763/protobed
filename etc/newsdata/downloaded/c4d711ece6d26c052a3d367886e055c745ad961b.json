In another case, the woman was pulled from a lake at a Dallas park. And in a third, she was found dead near a golf course, just weeks after she survived a brutal beating that was captured on video.\n\nIn the United States this year, at least 18 transgender people \u2014 most of them transgender women of color \u2014 have been killed in a wave of violence that the American Medical Association has declared an \u201cepidemic.\u201d The killings, which have been reported across the country, have heightened fears and alarm among communities already familiar with looming threats to their safety.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always in the forefront of our minds, when we\u2019re leaving home, going to work, going to school,\u201d said Kayla Gore, who lives in Memphis. \u201cGuys were flirting with me at the gas station, and the first thought was, \u2018This could go horribly wrong.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe killings this year follow at least 26 recorded last year by the Human Rights Campaign.
