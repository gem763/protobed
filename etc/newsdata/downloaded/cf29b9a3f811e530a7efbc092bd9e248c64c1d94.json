However, under tournament rules, referees are not allowed to talk to the media.\n\nNo one disputed that Vahaamahina should have been sent for a clear red card offence.\n\nThe lock announced his retirement from international rugby on Monday.\n\nThere was support for Peyper from Wales coach Warren Gatland on Monday.\n\n\"He's had his 50th cap and he's posing with fans,\" he said \"The way things are and how PC everyone is, people like to make mountains out of molehills. That's how I view it.\"\n\nWorld Cup-winning former England coach Clive Woodward also defended the South African \"100 percent\".\n\n\"It's ludicrous that the so-called incident is being investigated in any way and for those in the French camp kicking off I would say you have infinitely more serious things to be considering,\" he wrote in Britain's Daily Mail.\n\n\"Such as your shambolic coaching and persistent ill-discipline on the pitch which for decades now has seen France underperform.\"\n\nAs a South African, Peyper would not have been considered for the Wales-Springboks semi-final in any case but World Rugby have appointed Nigel Owens to officiate Saturday's England-New Zealand match.\n\nFrenchman Jerome Garces will take charge of the second semi-final between the Welsh and South Africa at Yokohama on Sunday.", "description": "Jaco Peyper posed with fans mimicking a key red-card incident in a quarter-final he refereed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/24/84/54/1000x563_cmsv2_8275a52a-2b1a-5a48-9a24-ee1d7b9486a4-4248454.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
