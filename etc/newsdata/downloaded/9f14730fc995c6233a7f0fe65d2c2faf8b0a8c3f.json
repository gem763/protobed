The Church says she was cured, but given the stigmata in exchange.\n\nEvery Friday at 3pm she would be immobilised in \"ecstasy\" as she relived the suffering in body and mind, it says.\n\nShe will be canonised alongside Brazilian Sister Dulce Lopes Pontes, who was a member of the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Conception and considered a \"mother of the poor\".\n\nBorn in 1914 into an upper middle-class family in Salvador, she started a health clinic for poor workers and opened a school, a hospital, and an orphanage, as well as care centres for the elderly and disabled.\n\nSister Dulce, dubbed the \"good angel of Bahia\", was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988.\n\nShe was visited in hospital the year before her death by Pope John Paul II, who called her work \"an example for humanity\".\n\nTens of thousands of people attended her funeral in 1992.", "description": "Pope Francis creates five new saints on Sunday, including Britain's Cardinal John Henry Newman -- one of the Catholic Church's most renowned converts -- and a nun dubbed the \"Mother Teresa of Brazil\".
