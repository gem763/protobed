Three years later, almost no construction has happened and Mexico has repeatedly made it clear that it will not be paying a cent.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump\u2019s dear friends on Fox & Friends finally admitted what has been obvious for years: this was an empty claim, a broken promise, and a huge failure on the part of Trump.\n\nThe show\u2019s famously pro-Trump hosts made the admission that Mexico is never paying for the wall in a segment highlighting the administration\u2019s plan to unilaterally divert $3.6 billion in funds from 127 defense programs to begin major construction.\n\nNoting that the wall was Trump\u2019s \u201cmost prominent campaign promise,\u201d co-host Ainsley Earhardt observed that the administration faces a choice between military projects and building up to 500 miles of the wall \u2014 far less than what Trump promised to build as a candidate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCo-host Brian Kilmeade slammed \u201csensationalist headlines\u201d but, when addressing one noting that Trump\u2019s new plan \u201clets Mexico off the hook\u201d for paying, he conceded: \u201cHe\u2019s right. The president never should have said Mexico was gonna pay for the wall.\u201d\n\nCo-host Steve Doocy then attempted to defend Trump, suggesting that perhaps the president thought he would get Mexico to pay for the wall but was just mistaken.\n\n\u201cI think he thought he would find a way for Mexico to pay for it, but as we know that did not work.\u201d\n\nEarhardt then noted that the money for Trump\u2019s wall would now come from money that would have gone to things including a middle school at Fort Campbell, child development centers at Joint Base Andrews, and a fire station in Beaufort, South Carolina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoocy then suggested that if Congress decides to appropriate more money to go to those previously funded and now raided programs, they could save the projects. In other words, rather than cut spending, the co-host thinks the solution is for them to appropriate the same $3.6 billion to the same programs twice.\n\nIn February 2016, Trump said that Mexico would be \u201cvery happy about\u201d paying for the wall. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to them. They\u2019re going to be thrilled to be paying for the wall. We\u2019re going to be the smart people. We\u2019re not going to be the people that get pushed around all over the place, we\u2019re going to be the smart people.\u201d\n\nIn April 2016, Trump vowed the wall would be done by now: \u201cI would say it\u2019ll be complete within two years from the time we start. We\u2019ll start quickly. We\u2019ll start quickly. And it\u2019ll be a real wall. It\u2019ll be a real wall.\u201d\n\nOn another occasion, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ll build a wall, I promise. I promise, we will build a wall. If there\u2019s ever a second term, you\u2019ll say, man, he got that wall built fast, we\u2019re going to put him up. So we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll build the wall.\u201d\n\nThough little to no progress has been made in building a new wall over the first three years of Trump\u2019s administration, he has repeatedly lied claiming it was already well underway.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1145317957.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
