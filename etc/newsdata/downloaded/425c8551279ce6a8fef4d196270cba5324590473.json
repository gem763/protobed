They each pleaded guilty in May to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.\n\nProsecutors asked U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani to impose an eight-month sentence and a $40,000 fine. Lawyers for the couple asked for probation and community service.\n\nIn addition to prison time, the Abbotts were ordered to pay $45,000 each in fines, perform 250 hours apiece of community service and will remain on supervised release for one year.\n\nLORI LOUGHLIN WAS 'OBSESSED' WITH GETTING DAUGHTERS INTO USC, REPORT CLAIMS\n\nGregory Abbott requested he serve his sentence in a correctional facility near Otisville, N.Y. while his wife requested doing her time near Dublin, Calif. He also asked the judge to stagger the sentences so a parent can remain with their daughter.\n\nMarcia Abbott will report to prison on Nov. 6 and Gregory Abbott on Jan. 3.\n\nAuthorities contend the Abbotts paid $50,000 to have a corrupt test proctor correct their daughter's ACT exams in 2018 and another $75,000 to rig her SAT subject tests in math and literature. The daughter was unaware of the scheme.\n\nProsecutors said the couple used the fact that their daughter had Lyme disease to allow her extra time to take the ACT in West Hollywood, Calif, about 1,000 miles from her Aspen, Colo., home.\n\nMarcia Abbott was hoping to use the higher scores to get her daughter into her alma mater, Duke University, according to the Boston Herald.\n\nGregory Abbott acknowledged his wrongdoing in a Sept. 27. letter to the court.\n\n\"I share the same sensibilities as most people and, strange as it may sound, identify with the public outrage over my own actions,\" he wrote.\n\nGregory Abbott lives in New York City while his wife stays in Aspen. He was chairman and CEO of International Dispensing Corp. until taking a leave of absence in March. Marcia Abbott is a former magazine editor and writer.\n\nThe scandal has engulfed wealthy couples and celebrities and put a microscope under the college admissions process. Actress Felicity Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in prison last month after admitting to paying $15,000 to rig her daughter's SAT score.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMassachusetts U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling told a Boston TV station Sunday that he plans to ask for a stiffer sentence for former \"Full House\" actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli.\n\nBoth are fighting charges that they paid $500,000 to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as fake athletes.\n\n\"Let's say she goes through to trial: If it's after trial, I think certainly we'd be asking for something substantially higher. If she resolved her case short of trial, something a little lower than that,\" Lelling told WCVB-TV.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A married couple who paid $125,000 to have their daughter's college entrance exam\u00a0scores altered so she could get into an elite university was sentenced Tuesday to a month each in prison.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19277807089047.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
