We actually blocked her because we thought they were just trying to do market research on us,\" he said.\n\n\"That resulted in her jumping across to Facebook and messaging us directly on that. We hadn't been expecting much but we were blown away by her knowledge, insights, and she really started helping us from day one before even talking about an investment or being involved.\"\n\nAfter meeting the entrepreneurial pair for coffee, Ms McGahan (who has also been an executive for Cotton On Group, Gap and Sussan) immediately called Strandbags owner and non-executive chairman Michael Lewis and said she thought the business could be big.\n\n\"The first reason I wanted to reach out was because coming from a business like Strandbags that's in a dominant position in the space, I'm very aware of how it's evolving and I've been following the emergence of the direct-to-consumer brands around the world,\" she said.\n\n\"They're incredibly smart, committed to its potential and I believe they can do it.\n\n\"When we had coffee I didn't know what the purpose was \u2013 if I was trying to see if they'd want to work for us or come into the business \u2013 but when I walked away from the meeting, I knew they had an amazing brand with huge potential and Strandbags as a group could absolutely help them.\"\n\nMs McGahan liked that July was an online company with a customer-first approach that was creating \"instagrammable\" luggage, but that it was also establishing a bricks and mortar presence \u2013 something the incumbent could help them navigate.\n\n\"I love how small the company is, how closely we can stay to it and they've taught us things like how they had a customer go online who wanted a bag quickly and then they put it in an Uber and had it to them in 30 minutes,\" she said. \"We're too big to do that, but it helps us imagine how we can think like that and stay close to the customer.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe funding injection will go towards the company expanding throughout Asia Pacific. Of the $10.5 million, Strandbags contributed $5 million in equity and $3 million in debt, with the remaining capital coming from a family office.\n\nIn the next 12 months the co-founders intend to have a presence both online and on the ground in Singapore, Korea and China.\n\nWhile the company is a retail start-up, it also places a substantial emphasis on technology and has created a way to personalise all of its bags using ultraviolet light, rather than relying on individuals to complete monograms.\n\nMr Didaskalou said to be truly customer-focused it was imperative that the company also have a physical presence, with many of it customers needing a bag that day or that hour, but that it had evolved from the standard retail operating model.\n\n\"We've structured our retail strategy so that each store isn't in isolation in their budgets and revenues are all part of overall targets,\" he said.\n\n\"It creates one whole experience. You can come in, feel the case and then decide to buy it online later and it doesn't create any competition between in-store and online.\"", "description": "Strandbags has made its first investment in a start-up, after its managing director reached out to the founders of July on Instagram.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4992%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_637%2C$y_116/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2aee45f92198e5aa589f2f903e73869c4a29efaa", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
