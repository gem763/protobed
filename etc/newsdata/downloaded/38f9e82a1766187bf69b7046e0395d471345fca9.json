REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/Files\n\nGou, Taiwan\u2019s richest person with a net worth of $7.6 billion according to Forbes, has extensive business interests in China and is in known for his close ties with Beijing leaders.\n\nHe is also known for asserting that self-ruled Taiwan is part of \u201cone China\u201d, a cherished principle for China, while acknowledging Taipei and Beijing have their own interpretations of what that means.\n\nHe has also repeatedly called for closer ties with Beijing, which would likely welcome his bid to challenge Tsai, who Beijing views as untrustworthy. Tsai is hoping to win a second term in next year\u2019s election.\n\nGou announced his intention to contest the presidential election in April as the candidate for the China-friendly opposition Kuomintang (KMT). But he lost his bid to win the party\u2019s nomination in July.\n\nThat raised speculation he would enter the presidential race as an independent but Gou\u2019s aide, Tsai Chin-yu, told reporters in Taipei his decision to resign as a member of the KMT was not linked to a decision on whether to run for president.\n\nShe cited disappointment with the leadership of a party which she said had become \u201coutdated\u201d.\n\n\u201cEffective today, Mr Terry Gou quits the Kuomintang,\u201d the aide said.\n\nThe KMT said it \u201cdeeply regretted\u201d Gou\u2019s decision and urged unity within the party to win the election.\n\nTwo people familiar with Gou\u2019s thinking said the 68-year-old billionaire was set to announce his bid to become president as an independent candidate by a Sept. 17 deadline for nominations.\n\nGou would appeal to voters who are dissatisfied with Taiwan\u2019s economy and in favour of closer ties with Beijing, one of the sources said.\n\nRelations with Beijing, which have cooled since Tsai became president in 2016, are bound to dominate Taiwan\u2019s election.\n\nBeijing suspects Tsai of pushing for Taiwan\u2019s formal independence although she denies that.\n\nBeijing considers democratic Taiwan a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to take it over.\n\nAnalysts say Gou\u2019s links to China might put off some voters, especially those who are increasingly wary of Beijing\u2019s ambitions to absorb the island.\n\nGou stepped down as chief of Foxconn this year, handing over the running of the company to an operations committee. But he retained a seat on the board of the company, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd.\n\nShares of Foxconn rose 1.6% on Thursday, beating the benchmark index\u2019s 0.3% rise. They are down about 20% since Gou announced his presidential bid in mid- April.\n\nAnalysts say a bid by Gou to become president as an independent could split the KMT, whose presidential candidate, Han Kuo-yu, is struggling in opinion polls.", "description": "Terry Gou, the founder of Apple supplier Foxconn, quit Taiwan's main opposition party on Thursday, paving the way for a possible bid to stand in a presidential election as an independent, complicating President Tsai Ing-wen's prospects.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428936359&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B089", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
