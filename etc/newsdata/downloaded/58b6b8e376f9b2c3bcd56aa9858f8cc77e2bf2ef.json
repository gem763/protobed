(AP/Chuck Burton)\n\nMichael Jordan agreed to sell a \u201clarge piece\u201d of the Charlotte Hornets to a pair of New York-based investors on Saturday, though will retain majority control of the team, according to the Charlotte Observer.\n\nJordan is selling parts of the team to Melvin Capital founder Gabe Plotkin and DI Capital founder Daniel Sundheim. The two still need to be approved by the NBA before the sale can go through, though that is expected to be made official in the coming weeks, according to the Observer. It\u2019s not yet clear how much of the team Jordan is selling.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nJordan purchased the organization in 2010 for $275 million, taking over from former owner Bob Johnson. He became a minority investor with the team in 2006, and held the final say on basketball decisions. According to Forbes, the franchise is currently worth $1.3 billion \u2014 the third-lowest in the league. By comparison, the New York Knicks are worth $4 billion.\n\nDespite the sale, though, Jordan still plans to own and run the Hornets for \u201ca good, long time,\u201d per the report. He currently owns about 97 percent of the team, and \u201cis attracted to adding investors with deep resources who might offer new ideas regarding technology advances,\u201d according to the Observer.\n\nThe Hornets have struggled under Jordan\u2019s leadership, however. Since the Hall of Famer took over in 2010, the team has made the playoffs just twice and has only compiled a winning record two times. The Bobcats won just seven games during the 2011-12 season, too, and lost the final 23 games of that shortened-season. That marked the worst finish in league history.\n\nThe Hornets finished last season with a 39-43 record, just narrowly missing the final spot in the playoffs.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Michael Jordan will retain majority control of the Hornets after selling a \"large piece\" to a pair of New York-based investors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/355BVvRcv2BWx6aq2Upsag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03OTIuNTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pcKqibR19NiMGni3.CpfbQ--~B/aD0yNzY2O3c9NDQ2NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/6d831420-d73b-11e9-9bb2-6b53006124b3", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
