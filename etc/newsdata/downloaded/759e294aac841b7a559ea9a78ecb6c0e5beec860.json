MUFG has a presence in the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, including a wide network in Asia.\n\nIt has stakes in PT Bank Danamon Indonesia Tbk, Thailand's Bank of Ayudhya Pcl, Security Bank Corp of the Philippines, and Vietnam-based VietinBank. The ties reflect Japan's status as a top exporter to those countries, accounting for $83 billion in exports in 2018, according to IMF trade data.\n\nBy contrast, Japanese companies and banks have lagged behind Chinese rivals in other emerging markets, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Standard Bank, Africa's largest lender by assets, is 20% owned by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China\n\nWhile the new service will be provided for free, MUFG is betting it will mean new business if clients need foreign exchange transactions or capital investment.\n\nIt aims to have at least 300 clients registered on the platform, the official said.\n\n(Reporting by Takashi Umekawa and Takaya Yamaguchi; Editing by David Dolan and Sherry Jacob-Phillips)", "description": "TOKYO (Reuters) - MUFG Bank Ltd plans to roll out an online platform to help clients find business partners in countries outside of Asia where it does not have a strong network, an official with Japan's largest lender said.", "authors": ["Takashi Umekawa"], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
