Photo: Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nAnthony Jeselnik is a serious student of comedy. His give-no-fucks demeanor onstage belies all the work that goes into making jokes about dropping babies, suicide, and putting a bell around the neck of his grandmother with dementia. It makes sense, then, that Jeselnik admires the craft of ClickHole, the Onion offshoot that parodies the garbage of the internet. \u201cI read the Onion before, and the Onion was making fun of newspapers,\u201d Jeselnik recently told Vulture, \u201cwhich is not really how people get their news anymore.\u201d ClickHole distills everything we hate about the internet and how it\u2019s been designed to hijack our dopamine receptors and keep us from holding on to any one thought for more than ten seconds. A ClickHole headline takes work, telling an entire bizarre story in just a few words. And making an article that supports that headline is even harder. There are approximately 25 synonyms for \u201cbad son\u201d in the dreaded \u201cGarbage Sons\u201d quiz. That is a herculean effort.\n\nJeselnik\u2019s new Comedy Central show, Good Talk With Anthony Jeselnik, is for people who take their jokes seriously. Each episode sees Jeselnik sit down with a fellow comedy friend and talk shop and/or talk shit. It\u2019s for people who want to be in the greenroom before a comedy show almost as much as they want to be at the show itself. Jeselnik spoke to Vulture about his love for ClickHole and its dark yet absurd humor, the tragedy of private equity, and comedians who won\u2019t shut up about Johnny Carson.\n\nWhat do you like about ClickHole?\n\nIt\u2019s bizarre yet grounded, in a way that the Onion was for so long. But then internet journalism changed. The Onion made fun of newspapers, whereas ClickHole makes fun of the internet. I absolutely love it. It\u2019s brilliant. ClickHole takes the BuzzFeed approach. It\u2019s a much more updated version of the kind of crap you see that passes as journalism. Clickbait, things like that.\n\nIt\u2019s so well-versed in that gross, jargony language that internet journalism has become. Are there words that have been ruined for you by the internet?\n\n\u201cFail.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t stop watching\u201d will ruin it for me. \u201cYou have to read this.\u201d I\u2019m just so skeptical now of anything that tells you that you should read it. I\u2019m much more interested in boring, flat headlines than I am in anything that tells me it\u2019s a \u201cwin.\u201d \u201cThis couldn\u2019t get more perfect.\u201d Stuff like that is such obvious clickbait that I\u2019m not into it.\n\nYou\u2019re right that ClickHole is bizarre yet grounded in this language we all know and hate, but it\u2019s also almost wacky at times. Does that work for you?\n\nIt\u2019s wacky, but it\u2019s a dark wacky. I\u2019m looking at one right now, \u201cAn Incredible Prodigy: This 4-Year-Old Wine Taster Just Became the Youngest Person Ever to Pass the Master Sommelier Exam.\u201d You read it and it sounds like [normal content] from somewhere else, until you realize it\u2019s a 4-year-old drinking wine. I love that kind of absurd darkness. Or the absurdity of \u201cThe First Time I Drank Gatorade.\u201d Everyone is making no sense, but they\u2019re speaking so seriously. I\u2019m a big fan of \u201cTwo Years Ago, This Man Was 500 Pounds. Now He Is Two Men Who Weigh 250 Pounds.\u201d They play it so sincerely. It kills me; it cracks me up every time.\n\nOne of my favorites is a listicle, which might be my least favorite way to consume information: \u201c5 Times the Animatronic Fox on Splash Mountain Addressed Me by Name and Told Me He Was Going to Marry My Dad.\u201d\n\nI remember that one, that\u2019s a great one. And I\u2019ve never been on Splash Mountain, but I get the joke immediately. It\u2019s like an insane person wrote it, with utter confidence. I always think that is funny: insanity with complete confidence. You reminded me of one of my favorites, \u201c5 of My Father\u2019s Funerals Where He Turned Out to Be Alive and in Attendance, and 2 Funerals Where He Was Actually Dead.\u201d It\u2019s so stupid. Oh wait, I\u2019m remembering so many more. \u201c4 Times My Dad Ate a Single Oyster and Started Acting Like the Horniest Person in the World Because He Read Online They Were an Aphrodisiac.\u201d It\u2019s grounded in just enough reality to get that moment of recognition, but they\u2019re insane. I love it.\n\n5 Of My Father\u2019s Funerals Where He Turned Out To Be Alive And In Attendance, And 2 Funerals Where He Was Actually Dead https://t.co/JvZGKBqoJN pic.twitter.com/WOQFcqJW6m \u2014 ClickHole (@ClickHole) March 3, 2019\n\nWait, \u201cGarbage Sons\u201d is also about a dad. Are dads just inherently the funniest member of a family?\n\nIf you think about the pictures they use, then yes. The picture of the dad with the oysters looks like a fucking soccer coach, and it\u2019s hilarious. I love jokes that only work in this format. A ClickHole headline or an Onion headline only works if it looks like it\u2019s in a newspaper or on a news site, if it has a picture that goes along with it. You could never get away with these jokes onstage.\n\n4 Times My Dad Ate A Single Oyster And Started Acting Like The Horniest Person In The World Because He Read Online They Were An Aphrodisiac https://t.co/3AcTMxlmPl pic.twitter.com/cuHzbEOwjk \u2014 ClickHole (@ClickHole) August 20, 2018\n\nBut there are shared skills. Your jokes are really tight, and ClickHole headlines have to be really tight because they have to contain the whole joke. A lot of people skip the article and just read the headline. What do people who don\u2019t do this for a living not know about making really concise jokes?\n\nYou have to take off as many words as you possibly can. People think that the setup has to lead you one way or another, but you still have to do that with an economy of words. That\u2019s one thing I love about ClickHole: There\u2019s a set of rules that they follow when they write. The entire joke has to be in the headline. It can\u2019t be the kind of thing where you have to click on something to get the joke. It\u2019s all there. Same with Onion headlines. I haven\u2019t read an Onion article in years, but I always read the headlines. It really is looking at your joke and taking out every word that you don\u2019t need. A first draft of a joke, you always think you\u2019re going to need more because you\u2019re trying to hide this punch line. So you think you need more camouflage, and you really need less. The audience isn\u2019t watching a magic trick, they\u2019re just listening to you. You don\u2019t need as many words as you think you do.\n\nSome people are just telling stories, and economy of words is not important. There are people who you\u2019re happy to listen to prattle on. But I\u2019ve got to be very short and sweet.\n\nGoing back to ClickHole\u2019s institutional voice, it\u2019s only recently that people have been able to claim their ClickHole or Onion articles. And then, unfortunately, it\u2019s been after they were laid off.\n\nIt sounds, frankly, devastating. I would hate to be writing something so fun and not get any credit whatsoever. They don\u2019t even get bylines. And I know they don\u2019t get paid that well. It\u2019s kind of a thankless job, but I am thankful they do it. I\u2019ve met people who\u2019ve come from the Onion who now have great careers, but it breaks my heart that something I love so much \u2026 everyone who works there is trying to move on from there. They\u2019re trying to get into advertising, or get a TV writing gig because you really can\u2019t make a living writing for a humor site \u2014 even a great one.\n\nClickHole and the Onion, the whole Gizmodo Group actually, were sold to a private-equity firm recently.\n\nThat makes sense \u2014 all these assets combining into one, where they shear content and clearly cut staff. ClickHole used to have five new articles a day. Now it\u2019s one or two if you\u2019re lucky.\n\nI miss the celebrity-gossip offshoot, StarWipe.\n\nStarWipe was great. It was really funny, but didn\u2019t last that long. But I think ClickHole cannibalized a lot of what StarWipe did. What I wish ClickHole would do more of is the \u201cThey Said What?\u201d when they fake a celebrity quote that is clearly bonkers. Sometimes you see celebrities get mad about them on Twitter, saying, \u201cI never said this!\u201d\n\nTell me about the new show.\n\nThe show is called Good Talk With Anthony Jeselnik. There are thoughtful questions, there\u2019s stuff to make you think, Oh, I\u2019m learning about comedy! \u2014 things you won\u2019t hear unless you\u2019re backstage before a show. But it\u2019s also got jokes. Just putting my friends in the hot seat and making them squirm a little bit is always fun.\n\nI got into comedy partially because when two comedians do a comedy show, they cross the stage and shake hands, and they whisper something into each other\u2019s ear. And I always wanted to know what they were saying. It\u2019s half of why I got into comedy. And Good Talk is for people who want to know what we\u2019re talking about in that moment.\n\nThe handshake always fascinates me at a stand-up show. No matter how inconvenient it is for a performer with a guitar or notebook or whatever, they have to do the handshake. It\u2019s like you have to physically touch the host to transfer control of the stage.\n\nYeah, it is weird. Not everybody does it. Some people will say, \u201cDon\u2019t shake my hand,\u201d or will exit on the other side of the stage to avoid the awkwardness entirely. I always like it. I like that moment of \u201cLet\u2019s say something to each other.\u201d One time I said, \u201cLet\u2019s keep talking for a long time and see if the audience thinks it\u2019s funny.\u201d And they did not. They kind of laughed for a second, but then they thought we were just having a side conversation, and I definitely dug a hole immediately.\n\nThis is reminding me of one of the ClickHole stories you sent as one of your favorites, \u201cComedians Talk About the First Time Johnny Carson Invited Them Up on His Roof to Shotgun a Diet Dr Pepper.\u201d\n\nThat one, the article killed me. The article destroyed me. \u201cI hope you\u2019re thirsty, motherfucker.\u201d That sent me over the edge.\n\nIt was great because the author clearly knew the history of comedy, the stand-up boom, and what an asshole Carson could be.\n\nAnd the comics that sang his praises. Choosing Ellen DeGeneres and Drew Carey, they can\u2019t talk enough about getting called to the couch. I thought that was perfect.\n\nWhat has felt most like shotgunning a Dr. Pepper with Carson to you? Something that made you go, Oh! I\u2019m a part of this now.\n\nProbably the Donald Trump roast. When I did that, it felt like one of those make-or-break moments. And it changed things for me. But the fear is still there. If you take too much time off, you are quickly forgotten. But at this point, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a Dr. Pepper out there I haven\u2019t chugged. Having a failed TV show, and then coming back and doing a couple successful specials, then getting another TV show, that kind of lets you know that you\u2019re in business. In football, if you\u2019re a coach that\u2019s fired and then rehired, that lets you know you\u2019re in the system. It\u2019s only now that I feel in the system.", "description": "Ahead of the premiere of his new Comedy Central series, Anthony Jeselnik chatted with us about why he loves the humor site ClickHole so much.", "authors": ["Bethy Squires"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/27/27-anthony-jeselnik.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
