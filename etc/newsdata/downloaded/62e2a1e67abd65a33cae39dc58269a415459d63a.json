Ethereum is often sought after for its smart contract capabilities, making it one of the top blockchain to build new coins and decentralized apps on.\n\nUnfortunately, according to co-founder Vitalik Buterin, the network has become overstuffed in recent years, accounting for very high gas prices and slow transaction times. Other competing networks, like EOS and Tron, are starting to look pretty good by comparison, but IKEA suggests that perhaps Ethereum isn\u2019t as old or as done for as Buterin may have thought.\n\nThe transaction was initiated by a company called Trade Shift, a blockchain firm based in the United States. Fintech enterprise Monerium served as the \u201cmiddleman,\u201d overseeing the transaction and ensuring both parties received their dues.\n\nTrade Shift co-founder Gert Sylvest comments:\n\nProgrammable money regulated by governments will become the foundation for e-commerce payments because they enable so called \u2018smart contacts.\u2019 Smart contracts have many use cases. For example, they can be used to generate \u2018smart invoices,\u2019 which are invoices that basically settle themselves.\n\nThis would be revolutionary in that the invoices would not need to be overseen by either the sending or the receiving party. In addition, no middlemen would be required, and the steps often necessary for ensuring everything falls into place will occur on their own.\n\nEarly this year, the Icelandic government issued new laws that allowed the digitization of the country\u2019s national currency the krona. It was the digitized version of this money that was used to finalize the transaction between the two parties.\n\nSveinn Valfells, co-founder and CEO of Monerium, says:\n\nAs the first company authorized to issue e-money on blockchains, we are delighted to demonstrate the benefits of blockchains for mainstream B2B transactions using a legal form of digital money. Unlike cryptocurrency, which is volatile, e-money is a proven digital alternative to cash, regulated and redeemable on demand. Using programmable e-money in smart contracts heralds a new category of payments.\n\nThe digitized krona is now allegedly ready to be used throughout the country, according to reports from Monerium. The company also says that it\u2019s looking to expand its international territory and be utilized throughout all of Europe.\n\nWhat This Does for Future Crypto Payments\n\nDiscussing the circumstances of the event, CFO of Ikea Iceland Stefan Arnason explains that the recent transaction involving the ETH network is likely to open many doors for businesses to conduct business like this in the future:", "description": "IKEA Iceland has become one of the first companies to initiate a transaction via the Ethereum network with digital krona.", "authors": ["Nick Marinoff"], "top_image": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2018/09/shutterstock_497026894-iceland.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
