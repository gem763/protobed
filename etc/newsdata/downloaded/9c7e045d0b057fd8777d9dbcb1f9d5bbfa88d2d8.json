Instead, get ready for a small one.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at a press conference in Washington on January 30, 2019. (Leah Millis/Reuters).\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell faces one of the toughest moments of his tenure on Wednesday as he faces close scrutiny -- from Wall Street and the White House -- about his leadership of the central bank.\n\nHe is widely expected to lead the Fed to cut interest rates at their Wednesday meeting, which would be the second reduction this year. But just as revealing will be how Powell justifies this cut and what signals he sends about his outlook for the rest of the year.\n\nPresident Trump nominated Powell to run the Fed. Powell took over in early 2018, but he has found himself caught in the middle of dueling arguments for much of the past year. Trump and many on Wall Street want several more cuts by the end of the year, but some economists and top Fed leaders say the economy is doing well enough that it doesn\u2019t need extra stimulus from the Fed right now.\n\nThe benchmark U.S. interest rate is just shy of 2.25 percent, a low level by historical standards, and the Fed is expected to lower it to just under 2 percent on Wednesday.\n\n[Trump is handing Democrats an opening on the economy]\n\nPowell is not expected to commit to any additional rate reductions when he speaks at a press conference Wednesday. But he risks triggering a sea of red in the markets if he does not at least leave the door open to the possibility of more cuts. Wall Street is still penciling in one or two more reductions by December, according to the FedWatch tracker.\n\n\u201cI think Powell is going to have a hard time managing the committee and a hard time managing the message,\" said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust and a former Fed economist during the financial crisis.\n\nPowell has tried to cast the rate cuts as an insurance move that is meant to protect the economy against headwinds from the trade war and slower growth in Europe, China and other nations. But it remains unclear how much more insurance Powell thinks the economy needs at a time when the U.S. unemployment rate is near a half-century low, the economy is growing at a healthy pace, and inflation is showing signs of returning to the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent.\n\n[For the first time, most new working-age hires in the U.S. are people of color]\n\nIn recent speeches, Powell has portrayed the economy as \u201cin a good place.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen [Powell] spoke in Switzerland, he was really pretty upbeat about the U.S. economy and the current state of things,\" said Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS and a former Fed economist. \u201cThat could spook markets if he\u2019s implying he might be done with rate cuts.\u201d\n\nA committee of 10 meets Wednesday to vote on the interest rate level and at least two members of the committee are expected to vote against a rate cut, a signal of how much resistance there is to lowering the rate now, let alone doing additional cuts.\n\nIn addition to releasing a statement about the new interest rate level, the Fed will also release its quarterly economic projections on Wednesday. When the projections last came out in June, the Fed forecast 2.1 percent growth this year and the committee was split over whether to do any interest rate cuts at all this year. What those projections show now will be telling about where the Fed is likely to head.\n\nTrump called again this week for a \u201cbig\u201d reduction in the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate. The president has even suggested that he would like to see negative interest rates, an unprecedented move in the United States that many Fed watchers say should only be used in worst case scenarios.\n\n\u201cThe United States, because of the Federal Reserve, is paying a MUCH higher Interest Rate than other competing countries. They can\u2019t believe how lucky they are that Jay Powell & the Fed don\u2019t have a clue. And now, on top of it all, the Oil hit. Big Interest Rate Drop, Stimulus!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday.\n\nA cut typically stimulates growth because after the Fed reduces its interest rate, banks usually turn around and lower the rates on home mortgages, business loans, auto loans, and credit cards for consumers. Borrowers tend to like lower rates, while savers do not since banks usually lower the interest rate paid on savings accounts as well.\n\nBut there is concern that the Fed should not use all of its ammunition now when the economy is not yet showing major signs of weakness. While manufacturing has struggled and business investment has pulled back, consumer spending remains strong and that accounts for the bulk of the U.S. economy.\n\nWhen prior recessions hit, the Fed\u2019s interest rate was above 5 percent, allowing the central bank to cut swiftly -- and deeply -- but there\u2019s concern that the Fed\u2019s best tool is blunted this time around since rates are already so low.\n\nThere\u2019s a \"limit to how much lower to [rates], so I\u2019d rather wait until we really need it. If it looks like the economy is getting much weaker, then we aggressively try to address it. I don\u2019t think doing it gradually is likely to have that much of an impact,\u201d said Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed, told The Washington Post earlier this month.\n\nRosengren voted against the July cut and is expected to vote against lowering rates this week.\n\nThe attack on the Saudi oil fields over the weekend that sent oil prices up over 10 percent is also expected to be a topic of discussion, but former Fed staff point out that the central bank tends to be conservative in its projections and has typically viewed any price spikes in oil as temporary blips.\n\n\u201cFed staff will always be cautious. Their starting point will be \u2018we don\u2019t know very much yet, we don\u2019t know how persistent the shock will be, so let\u2019s not overreact until we know more,\u2019\u201d said Daniel Sichel, an economics professor at Wellesley College and former senior Fed economist who advised the chair.\n\nRelated:\n\nFor the first time, most new working-age hires in the U.S. are people of color\n\nTrump calls the Fed chair an \u2018enemy\u2019 after Powell said trade war is \u2018turbulent\u2019\n\nU.S. economy is \u2018relatively strong\u2019 and doesn\u2019t need lower interest rates, key Fed leader says", "description": "Fed Chair Jerome Powell faces his trickiest test yet Wednesday as he will try to tell America the economy is doing well -- but it needs a little boost from an interest rate cut.", "authors": ["Heather Long", "Economics Correspondent", "September At Am", "Heather Long Is An Economics Correspondent.
