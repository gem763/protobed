I think I have more mugs in my kitchen cabinets than I do any other drinking vessel. And while my collection has been cobbled together with dollar store finds and collectibles, there is a new category of mugs that I\u2019m obsessed with. Travel cups have been a mainstay in commuting for years, but now there are mugs, handle and all, that hold the perfect amount of liquid while on the go. I\u2019ll say it again: A HANDLE. Typical travel mugs are more like travel bottles: They\u2019re smooth and handle-free. That proves difficult to hold on to when you\u2019re hanging onto subway poles, pressed against a stranger\u2019s body, and wrangling a bag with a laptop in it. You deserve to be comfortable wielding a handle-adorned travel mug.\n\nElevation 14 Mug, $25 at Otterbox: This mug was made for the outdoors but you can use it on your desk, at home, and on your commute. The handle on the Otterbox mug is big enough to slide three fingers into, which gives enough grip to hold onto it no matter the traffic ahead. It\u2019s dishwasher and microwave safe so you can put any kind of liquid you sip in it without much consequence. The best part is that this ain\u2019t no dinky 8 oz mug. The 14 in the name means it holds up to 14 oz, so you can get all the caffeine you can handle without having to refill.\n\nSkyline Series 12 oz Coffee Mug, $30 at Hydroflask: The Coffee Mug from Hydroflask was designed to feel like you\u2019re just sipping your morning coffee no matter where you are. It has an insulated lid that was designed for both temperature control and spill resistance. It\u2019s BPA-free and has a lifetime warranty. Even though it only holds 12 oz, those ounces will stay warm thanks to Honeycomb Insulation.\n\nEllo Campy Vacuum-Insulated Stainless Steel Travel Mug, $17 on Amazon: If you\u2019re more into the traditional silhouette of a travel bottle, this one from Ello is a great option. It\u2019s made from insulated stainless steel and can keep drinks warm up to 10 hours. The best part is a slightly hidden feature. The inside of the handle is coated in cork, which means you\u2019ll never have a hot handle to hold. Everything is dishwasher safe and BPA-free. Plus, the camp-inspired colors and speckled exterior make it a unique on-the-go option.\n\nYETI Rambler 14 oz Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Mug, $25 on Amazon: Similar to the Otterbox mug, this one from Yeti fits your hand beautifully. It\u2019s dishwasher-safe and made to stay chip-free even if you drop it. The only difference between this and the Otterbox mug is that the lid doesn\u2019t have a sealing mechanism, so traveling with it may be a little harder.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
