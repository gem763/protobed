Elijah Cummings\u2019 (D-Md.) memorial service at the Capitol last Thursday went viral for refusing to shake Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s (R-Ky.) hand. The defiant act instantly rocketed him to internet fame. Now, he\u2019s speaking out about the snub.\n\nBobby Rankin, Cummings\u2019 close friend, told The Washington Post that he skipped over McConnell at the service as the senator waited with his hand extended because Rankin was reminded of his brother Jerry.\n\nJerry served in the Marines and died of cancer last October after exposure to tainted water at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. According to Rankin, Jerry never received the veterans benefits he had earned before his death. Rankin said he felt McConnell was partly to blame.\n\n\u201cI could not put my hands in the man\u2019s hand who refused to help somebody who served his country,\u201d Rankin said in an interview with the Post, published Monday. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it, because I was thinking about my brother.\u201d\n\nRankin said Cummings had \u201creached across party lines trying to help my brother get his military benefits\u201d by contacting McConnell\u2019s office. However, Rankin did not offer a clear explanation as to why Jerry didn\u2019t receive the benefits or what role McConnell had in the matter, if any.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s office did not confirm to HuffPost whether the senator had worked on the issue, and has offered no details.\n\nA Twitter user filmed the snub while streaming Cummings\u2019 service online, and her video has received more than 44,000 views.\n\nCummings, the first Black lawmaker to lie in state at the Capitol, served as chair of the House Oversight Committee, one of three of the chamber\u2019s panels helming an impeachment probe of President Donald Trump. The committee has also separately investigated potential power abuses by the Trump administration.\n\nThough Cummings received praise after his death for his ability to work with both parties, Trump called Cummings a \u201cbrutal bully\u201d and labeled his Baltimore district a \u201crodent infested mess\u201d in a racist Twitter rant over the summer.\n\nCummings died at age 68 on Oct. 17 after facing \u201ccomplications concerning longstanding health challenges,\u201d his office said.", "description": "Bobby Rankin told The Washington Post he refused to shake the Senate majority leader's hand for personal reasons.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db71a77200000de2f507034.jpeg?cache=avdzo5rmab&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
