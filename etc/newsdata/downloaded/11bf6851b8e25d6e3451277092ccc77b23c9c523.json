About $300 million of that will be split among 47 states and Washington, D.C. in the first year.\n\nThis funding is part of the White House\u2019s ongoing efforts to combat the opioid crisis, including reducing the demand and over-prescription of drugs; raising awareness through anti-drug campaigns and ramping up illegal drug seizures.\n\nIn 2018 Trump worked with Congress to pass the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which makes medical treatment for opioid addiction more widely available. The White House says this is the \u201clargest legislative package addressing a single drug crisis in history.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo many lives are stopped cold by drugs,\u201d Trump said in his address. \u201cMy administration is determined to use every resource at our disposal to smash the grip of addiction.\u201d\n\nAbout 130 Americans die every day from opioid-related drug overdoses, the CDC reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "\"These funds will be delivered to the communities where their help is most needed,\" the president said.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
