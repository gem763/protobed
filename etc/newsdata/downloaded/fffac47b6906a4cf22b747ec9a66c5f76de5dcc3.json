A protective award is additional redundancy compensation ordered by an employment tribunal if the staff weren\u2019t consulted by their employer before being let go.\n\nAlthough there is no guarantee the claims will be successful, they are \u201cworth bringing\u201d, says Richard Linskell, employment partner at law firm Gunnercooke.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

They were trying very hard to avoid the insolvency but that does not preclude them consulting at the same time.\u201d\n\nSimpson Millar gave the example of one ex-employee who found out she had lost her job from a generic email at 1am on Monday morning.\n\n\u201cWe knew there were difficulties earlier in the year, but they were played down internally,\u201d Claire Hoang from Stalybridge in Manchester was quoted as saying.\n\nIn other cases, former Thomas Cook workers didn\u2019t even receive the email and instead learnt of their fate via the news, the law firm said.\n\nEx-employees can claim a protective award only if they were made redundant alongside at least 19 other people at the same place of work. That would exclude people from smaller Thomas Cook stores.\n\nThe compensation is separate from basic redundancy pay and wages and benefits owed, but both are paid by the government\u2019s Insolvency Service if the employer has gone under.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Insolvency Service, 6,002 out of 9,041 Thomas Cook employees in the UK have been made redundant since the firm collapsed on Monday.", "description": "Over 100 former Thomas Cook employees are preparing to launch legal action against the collapsed travel firm over the way they lost their jobs.
