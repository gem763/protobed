He succeeded Barack Obama\u2019s first Energy secretary, Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate and a celebrated physics professor at UC Berkley.\n\nEven George W. Bush seemed to recognize the importance of having someone with a strong scientific background in this post, making Samuel Bodman, who had an MIT chemical engineering background, as his Energy secretary.\n\nTrump, however, went in a very different direction, tapping Texas Gov. Rick Perry for the job, despite the fact that the governor had no scientific background, and despite the fact that Perry had publicly called for the elimination of the cabinet agency he\u2019d soon lead.\n\nEmbroiled in scandal, Perry is stepping down, and now we know whom the Republican president has in mind as his successor in the cabinet.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday tapped Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette to succeed Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who is expected to leave the agency\u2019s top post at the end of the year. Brouillette \u2013 whose broad experience in Washington\u2019s backrooms includes stints as a top lobbyist for the Ford Motor Company, the chief of staff for the House Energy and Commerce Committee and senior Energy Department roles in multiple administrations \u2013 is a \u201ctotal professional,\u201d Trump said in nominating him.\n\nIn a GOP-led Senate, Brouillette\u2019s confirmation is a safe bet, and when he arrives in the White House cabinet, he\u2019ll be one of several members with backgrounds in corporate lobbying. Indeed, Brouillette was a top lobbyist for Ford, and his nomination comes on the heels of Trump tapping Mark Esper, a former lobbyist for a leading defense contractor, to serve as the secretary of Defense.\n\nThat nomination came just one month after the president traveled to Orlando to officially launch his re-election campaign, boasting to supports, \u201cWe stared down the unholy alliance of lobbyists and donors and special interests, who made a living bleeding our country dry. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nAs regular readers know, it\u2019s not at all what Trump and his team have done. In fact, at the next cabinet meeting, Brouillette and Esper will be joined by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt who lobbied for the energy industry, and EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, who also lobbied for the energy industry.\n\nThere\u2019s also HHS Secretary Alex Azar who helped oversee the lobbying efforts for a giant pharmaceutical company.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just at the cabinet level. As we discussed a while back, much of the White House and federal agencies have been populated with former lobbyists. ProPublica reported last week on the \u201cstaggering\u201d number of lobbyists who\u2019ve worked in the Trump administration.\n\nThis isn\u2019t exactly what voters were told to expect when Candidate Trump was seeking the presidency. On the contrary, the Republican spent months telling voters how tired he was of everyone in D.C. \u201cbeing controlled by the special interests and the lobbyists.\u201d At one point, he went so far as to say he\u2019d have \u201cno problem\u201d banning lobbyists from his administration altogether.\n\nIn 2016, Trump even unveiled a fairly specific blueprint for \u201cending government corruption,\u201d which included a series of provisions pertaining to limiting the influence of lobbyists.\n\nI have some bad news for voters who took the rhetoric seriously.", "description": "It's not just the fact that Trump keeps tapping former lobbyists for his cabinet; it's also the fact that Trump promised voters he'd do the opposite.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_velshi_brk_energy_secy_191018_1920x1080.jpg?itok=7TrIZS-G", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
