Unconscious, she was transported to an area hospital where she was pronounced dead.\n\n'It appears it was a very busy morning for the family. They have several other children as well and in an effort to get everybody where they needed to go, the toddler was left in the backseat,' said Steve Hegarty with the Tampa Police Department.\n\nA family forgot to check the backseat of this Jeep Monday and their 1-year-old died after sitting in the hot car for hours\n\nThere have been nearly 50 child deaths this year related to heatstroke from being in a car\n\nTampa police were called to scene Monday evening after a 1-year-old was mistakenly left in their car and later died\n\nTampa police's Stephen Hegarty said a tragic result was caused by confusion: '[He] then took a separate car to work that caused him to forget the child was in the backseat of the car'\n\nTampa police said the death appears to be accidental, and there are no signs of foul play.\n\n'The dad used the vehicle the toddler was in to take people to school, to work, and all that,' Hegarty said.
