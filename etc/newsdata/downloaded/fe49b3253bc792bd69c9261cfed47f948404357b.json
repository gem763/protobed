Now, it's assembled a new team of execs and a big re-branding push to focus on its human advice.\n\nThe 10-year-old wealth management firm offers free personal finance tools that it uses to help funnel potential clients to human advisers. But despite its online presence, it sees traditional full-service broker-dealer \"wirehouses\" as its main competitors, not young robo-advice companies.\n\nExecutives said that they are trying to make Personal Capital a household brand, and say they are banking on a marketing overhaul inspired by the aesthetic of companies like Apple and coffee-seller Blue Bottle.\n\nPure robo-advisers and self-directed investing options have meanwhile proliferated since Personal Capital first launched, and the digital-only wealth offerings have far outpaced the firm in terms of gathering assets.\n\nWe spoke with a half-dozen executives and senior leaders at Personal Capital about what the firm can do differently as the digital wealth management and advice industry Personal Capital had a hand in pioneering quickly transforms around it.\n\nGrowing up in the industry it helped launch\n\nThe Redwood Shores, California-based firm \u2014 which now has some 130 advisers based across offices in California, Colorado, Georgia, and Texas \u2014 came onto the scene in 2009 before Wealthfront and Betterment launched. But the robo-advisers have eclipsed Personal Capital in assets under management \u2014 while Personal Capital has roughly $11 billion, as of September Wealthfront has $20 billion; Betterment has $16 billion in assets as of last week.\n\nMeanwhile traditional wirehouses \u2014 large full-service broker-dealers which can boast some 15,000 financial advisers \u2014 manage trillions in wealth even as some lose advisers to the independent registered investment adviser (RIA) space.\n\nThe firm's new logo. Personal Capital\n\nPersonal Capital's assets under management have trended steadily higher in recent years, adding roughly between $2 billion and $3.5 billion per year since 2016.\n\nThe firm has in recent months added capabilities for high-net-worth and less-affluent customers alike \u2014 far more like big banks' aspirations to go both up-market and down-market, and less like a purely digital robo-adviser.\n\nTo date, the firm has raised some $290 million in funding from firms including BlackRock, USAA, IGM Financial, and BBVA Ventures. Personal Capital declined to comment on whether it had plans to go public.\n\nPersonal Capital in June launched a high-yield savings account and a tool for savings and planning. Robos like Wealthfront have looked to high-yield accounts to draw in cash \u2014 though recent Fed rate cuts have upped pressure on firms to cut yields they had been touting to consumers.\n\nMeanwhile Personal Capital's most well-heeled clients earlier this year gained access to private equity investments through a partnership with the BlackRock-backed financial technology company iCapital; that firm last week was linked to Charles Schwab in a similar relationship.\n\nIt's also made hires to focus on growth and marketing. Personal Capital brought on its first chief growth officer, a new marketing chief, and a leader overseeing a new \"voice of the customer\" group focused on incorporating user feedback into the rest of the business.\n\nA new look\n\nThe firm earlier this year brought on Porter Gale as its marketing chief to scrap the firm's old branding. In developing new branding that went live on Tuesday, Gale said she looked to what she calls \"challenger,\" or disrupter, brands like the coffee chain Blue Bottle and Apple's clean, straightforward advertising.\n\nThe new branding places a big emphasis on the \"Personal\" in its name, with what it calls a \"modern\" electric blue color running through its online dashboard, new logo, and mobile application rather than its previous navy, royal blue, and green scheme. Gale said in a release that it's \"essential to demonstrate that we know the importance of the 'personal' in our name and that we're here to help.\"\n\nGale, who also sits on the board of Reddit, told us that through research she found people have misunderstood what Personal Capital actually does.\n\n\"Some people perceived us primarily as a personal finance tools company. Then there is some misperception that, and I'll be honest, it's mainly on the journalistic side, where people are reporting that we're a robo-adviser \u2014 and we're not,\" said Gale. \"We actually are a combination of amazing technology and financial tools.\"\n\nThat notion has turned into a sticking point, said David Goldstone, the head of research at industry research firm Backend Benchmarking, who said the firm is \"less of a mass-market solution.\"\n\n\"They're different from Wealthfront and Betterment. They used to stand out more in the universe. A little bit less so now, especially considering Vanguard,\" Goldstone said, referring to the investment behemoth's recent efforts to pair human advice with digital planning tools.\n\nVanguard, the firm that popularized cheap investing, said in September that it was pilot-testing a digital advice and planning tool, and four years ago debuted a hybrid robo tool called Personal Advisor Services.\n\nStill, Personal Capital chief executive Jay Shah said the firm serves people of all ages, not only those who have accumulated a reasonable amount of wealth.\n\n\"We have people in their twenties, thirties, forties, and 50s, well into retirement. We serve that entire spectrum, in terms of users as well as clients. So many of them are discovering this as a solution,\" Shah, who was a founding executive member and formerly the chief operating officer, told us.\n\nPersonal Capital's new dashboard comes with a different color scheme. Personal Capital\n\nPersonal Capital now has around 130 advisers. Human advice starts at clients with at least $100,000 in assets. Those with $100,000-$200,000 are served by the investment services group, those with $200,000 to $1 million are considered the wealth management group, and those with more than $1 million go in the private client group.\n\nFees for investment advice on the first $1 million are 0.89% of assets under management. From there, fees scale down to bottom out at 0.49% of assets under management for $10 million or more.\n\nThe firm's most affluent clients, with an average age in the mid-50s, fall under Michelle Brownstein.\n\nAn alum of Fisher Investments who joined the firm in 2011, Brownstein said her goal for Personal Capital's current fiscal year \u2014 which ends in June 2020 \u2014 is to grow the private client group by $1 billion. Some two-dozen advisers work in that group; the firm declined to comment on its total assets under management.\n\n\"One of the biggest reasons people hire us is because of our fiduciary duty, whereas at a lot of the wirehouses, many of the financial advisers are technically a dual adviser,\" she told us in an interview.\n\nThe duty of the financial adviser is one that's come to the fore this year with the Securities and Exchange Commission's passage of Regulation Best Interest, or \"Reg BI,\" as it's known in the industry. The rule is a new rubric intended to set up a new standard of financial advice for broker-dealers. A spokesperson said the firm's brand re-design is not connected to Reg BI.\n\nBut hitting the refresh button on Personal Capital has long been in the making.\n\nWhen Gale first joined Personal Capital earlier this year, she and Shah spoke about the desire to become a truly household name. At the time, there was a feeling that the firm needed to better convey its human touch.\n\n\"I've got my fingers crossed, but I don't know if in 12 months we will be that household name that we talked about,\" Shah said. \"But I think we're going to be well on our way.\"", "description": "Personal Capital has enlisted a cadre of new leaders as it seeks to re-tool its look and define its identity as a wealth management firm.", "authors": ["Rebecca Ungarino"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8286ff2e22af0385388066?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
