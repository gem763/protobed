In a statement, the speaker called her brother \u201cthe finest public servant I have ever known.\u201d\n\nKnown as \u201cYoung Tommy,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Alesandro was the oldest son of Thomas J. \u201cBig Tommy\u201d D\u2019Alesandro Jr., who had been one of Maryland\u2019s dominant civic leaders in the mid-20th century as a state delegate, congressman and, from 1947 to 1959, the mayor of Baltimore. Pelosi, Mr. D\u2019Alesandro\u2019s youngest sibling and only sister, grew up to become a California congresswoman and twice the nation\u2019s most powerful female elected official.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen Mr. D\u2019Alesandro took the oath of office as Baltimore mayor on Dec. 5, 1967, it seemed like the fulfillment of a political prophecy that he might take over the Democratic fiefdom that his father had stitched together over three decades.\n\nMr. D\u2019Alesandro\u2019s four years as mayor began at a wrenching time for U.S. cities with large African American populations. Violent civil unrest had unfolded from the Watts neighborhood in Los Angeles to Newark. Baltimore, Mr. D\u2019Alesandro later reflected to NPR, was \u201ca segregated city . . . a Southern city,\u201d but he held out hope that its long-established black middle and professional class would help his metropolis avoid upheaval.\n\nHe had been in office only four months when King\u2019s assassination in Memphis on April 4, 1968, triggered rioting in more than 100 cities. During that brief period, Mr. D\u2019Alesandro had appointed African Americans to several city commissions and boards where none had previously served, and he took stands in favor of civil rights and integration that led to him getting booed at \u201cI Am an American Day\u201d parades.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe had a track record of personal commitment \u201cto equality and civil rights,\u201d said Matthew Crenson, a Johns Hopkins University scholar of Maryland politics.\n\nIn the early days after the assassination, Baltimore remained quiet while Washington, Chicago and other cities erupted in violence. \u201cI was starting to feel it was too calm,\u201d he told the Baltimore Sun years later, recalling the preparations that he began making for potential unrest, including meeting with police and local African American leaders.\n\nBut then, on April 6, late in the afternoon of a warm spring Saturday, someone tossed a brick through a plate-glass store window in a black neighborhood. Within hours, the city was engulfed in rioting, burning and looting.\n\nAD\n\nIt took all of Baltimore\u2019s police force, 500 Maryland State Police officers, thousands of members of the Maryland National Guard and 5,000 soldiers from the Army\u2019s 82nd Airborne Division to restore order.\n\nAD\n\nThe riots left six dead and 700 injured. There were 1,032 fires, 4,500 arrests and 1,075 businesses looted; many of the stores never reopened.\n\nAfter the riots, Mr. D\u2019Alesandro presided over the enactment of a Baltimore civil rights bill guaranteeing access to public accommodations, won approval of an $80 million bond issue to build schools and created summer recreation programs that included mobile swimming pools and day camps for city youths.\n\nAD\n\nBaltimore also suffered from loss of manufacturing jobs, labor strife and white flight, but, for years, observers speculated that the riots were principally responsible for driving Mr. D\u2019Alesandro out of politics, an interpretation that he rejected. He told the Sun decades later that, while in office, he continued to map out his political trajectory, including a possible run for governor, before deciding against it.\n\nAD\n\nHe cited financial concerns among the chief reasons that kept him from seeking another term in 1971. He had five children to support, he said, and couldn\u2019t do it on the mayor\u2019s salary. \u201cI was clearing only $695 every two weeks,\u201d he told the Sun in 1998. \u201cI couldn\u2019t make ends meet.\n\nMr. D\u2019Alesandro began to hint in the final year of his mayoralty that he would serve only one term. The decision still came as a shock when he made it official. \u201cMy father was devastated,\u201d he told the Sun. \u201cHe thought I was crazy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe went into legal practice in Baltimore, away from the public spotlight, specializing in workers\u2019 compensation and personal injury cases. He retired in 1994.\n\nThomas Ludwig John D\u2019Alesandro III was born in Baltimore on July 24, 1929, and grew up in the Little Italy neighborhood near the city\u2019s Inner Harbor. His mother, the former Annunciata \u201cNancy\u201d Lombardi, was born in Naples, grew up in Baltimore and became a devoted political wife, helping organize her husband\u2019s campaigns and representing him when he was unavailable to constituents.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1952, when Mr. D\u2019Alesandro married Margaret \u201cMargie\u201d Piracci at the Baltimore Basilica, the Sun called it \u201cBaltimore\u2019s equivalent of a royal wedding,\u201d and more than 5,000 people were present. The city fire department had to turn some away.\n\nAD\n\nBig Tommy was his son\u2019s best man. The pope sent his blessing, and President Harry S. Truman sent a silver tray. Little sister Nancy was a bridesmaid.\n\nIn addition to his wife and his sister, survivors include five children; a brother; 10 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.\n\nMr. D\u2019Alesandro graduated from Baltimore\u2019s Loyola College in 1949 and from the University of Maryland law school in 1952. He served four years in the Army, won a seat on the city Board of Elections Supervisors and then, in 1962, on the City Council, where he served the next year as president. In his 1967 race for mayor, he crushed the opposition \u2014 lawyer and future Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos \u2014 in the Democratic primary. Mr. D\u2019Alesandro easily won the general election in November. He was 38.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to financial pressures, the social imperatives of politics weighed on him, Mr. D\u2019Alesandro told the Sun.\n\n\u201cI never liked the social aspect of politics. I loved government. My father loved it all. He loved the people. He loved everything about it. Not me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy father would go into a funeral establishment,\u201d he said, \u201cvisit the party of the deceased he had known. Then he\u2019d visit every other alcove in the funeral home. He\u2019d turn his visit into a political rally. I\u2019d go into a funeral home, pay my respects to the one person I knew there, sign the book and leave. Nobody would know I was there.\u201d\n\nMr. D\u2019Alesandro toyed with the idea of running for governor, mostly because the job came with a bigger salary, but other Democrats stood in his way. Maryland House Speaker Marvin Mandel had been elevated in 1969 to finished the term of Gov. Spiro T. Agnew, who resigned to become Richard M. Nixon\u2019s vice president. Kennedy in-law R. Sargent Shriver, a Maryland native, former Peace Corps director and U.S. ambassador to France, was also exploring a run.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMandel had the advantage of incumbency,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Alesandro recalled to the Sun in 1998. \u201cHe had a political base in Baltimore. Shriver had all that Kennedy money.\u201d Mandel went on to serve as the state\u2019s chief executive for much of the 1970s.\n\nMr. D\u2019Alesandro became an occasional adviser to his sister, 11 years his junior, who carried the family\u2019s political ambitions to a national level. Often asked to comment on the environment that shaped her, he spoke with admiration about her decision to start a political career in San Francisco, across the country from her home city. And he offered a bit of personal insight about her drive toward public service. \u201cIt\u2019s not a choice,\u201d he once told the Orlando Sentinel. \u201cIt\u2019s just innate in her.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries", "description": "The scion of a civic dynasty \u2014 and brother of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 he served as Baltimore\u2019s mayor from 1967 to 1971 before abruptly leaving politics.", "authors": ["Bart Barnes"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ik1hjJyLf35U33fH3u8Wi4ilVek=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZR6XTVXTNAI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
