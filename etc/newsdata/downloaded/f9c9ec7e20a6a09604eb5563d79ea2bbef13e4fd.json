I think people should just listen to it, think about it, and then make up their own minds as to what it says to them... Bohemian Rhapsody didn't just come out of thin air.\n\n\"I did a bit of research, though it was tongue-in-cheek and mock opera. Why not?\"\n\nMusic scholar Sheila Whiteley believes the song is about Freddie's first gay love affair after seven years of living with Mary.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nShe says that the word 'Mama' in the song actually means 'Mary' - as in Mother Mary - so therefore the line 'Mama Mia let me go' really means 'Mary let me go'.\n\nAfter they split, Freddie and Mary remained close friends until the day he died.\n\nHe moved out of the flat they shared and bought a home in Kensington, buying her a house of her own nearby.\n\nFreddie would often refer to Mary as his only true friend.\n\n(Image: YouTube)\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nSpeaking in 1985, he said: \"All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary, but it's simply impossible.\n\n\"The only friend I've got is Mary, and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that's enough for me.\"\n\nFreddie is said to have written many songs about Mary, including Love Of My Life.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe even became the godfather to her oldest son, Richard.\n\nOther theories about Bohemian Rhapsody are that it tells the story of a suicidal murderer being hunted by demons or that it depicts the events preceding an execution.\n\nIt was originally dismissed by the band's record label, who said it was too long - at 5 minutes 55 seconds.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
