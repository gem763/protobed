If Joe Biden can use the threat of withholding US aid to Ukraine to benefit his son, then why can\u2019t Trump do the same thing to benefit himself? And if it\u2019s an impeachable offense for one, why not the other?\n\nThe New York Times reported this past May on Biden\u2019s intervention as Vice President in the Ukrainian prosecution in 2016. The same elements of the so-called crime were in place \u2014 the personal gain, the use of US power to achieve it, the threat that make Ukrainian national security the ransom in the deal. It worked for Biden in 2016, too:\n\nIt was a foreign policy role Joseph R. Biden Jr. enthusiastically embraced during his vice presidency: browbeating Ukraine\u2019s notoriously corrupt government to clean up its act. And one of his most memorable performances came on a trip to Kiev in March 2016, when he threatened to withhold $1 billion in United States loan guarantees if Ukraine\u2019s leaders did not dismiss the country\u2019s top prosecutor, who had been accused of turning a blind eye to corruption in his own office and among the political elite. The pressure campaign worked. The prosecutor general, long a target of criticism from other Western nations and international lenders, was soon voted out by the Ukrainian Parliament. Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden, Mr. Biden\u2019s younger son, who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general. \u2026 The broad outlines of how the Bidens\u2019 roles intersected in Ukraine have been known for some time. The former vice president\u2019s campaign said that he had always acted to carry out United States policy without regard to any activities of his son, that he had never discussed the matter with Hunter Biden and that he learned of his son\u2019s role with the Ukrainian energy company from news reports. But new details about Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement, and a decision this year by the current Ukrainian prosecutor general to reverse himself and reopen an investigation into Burisma, have pushed the issue back into the spotlight just as the senior Mr. Biden is beginning his 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nAt that point, the stars were aligned for Trump. The Ukrainians were reopening the investigation into Burisma, perhaps raising hopes that their new investigation would highlight Biden\u2019s use of US diplomatic pressure to rescue Hunter\u2019s bosses. However, Petro Poroshenko suffered a surprising loss in the national elections to Volodymyr Zelensky, who planned to replace the prosecutors in his new government. That\u2019s what apparently prompted Trump to pressure Zelensky to keep the investigation open, with or without an explicit quid pro quo \u2014 the exact same thing Biden had done with Poroshenko to get the Burisma probe shut down three years earlier.\n\nKen Vogel, the lead NYT reporter on the story in May, told MSNBC that the situations are similar enough that perhaps the Left might want to tread carefully. If Democrats nominate Biden, this story would become \u201ca significant liability\u201d to their White House hopes. Vogel also suggested that Rudy Giuliani was making issues exponentially worse for Trump by opening his mouth, but Vogel\u2019s main observation was as popular across the aisle as you\u2019d expect:\n\nHere's @kenvogel of the New York Times saying on MSNBC that he views Joe Biden son's work in Ukraine as \"a significant liability for Joe Biden.\" \"There is a story here,\" Vogel adds, saying \"we're going to continue to, sort of, pull that back.\" (I'm sure Trump is very grateful!) pic.twitter.com/HSl90pk6Zn \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 20, 2019\n\nToday, Politico\u2019s team of reporters bolster Vogel\u2019s argument, although they also write that Biden\u2019s team has begun pushing back more aggressively on the comparison:\n\nDespite the outrage that greeted reports of the president\u2019s actions, Biden\u2019s immediate response was no simple matter. His son Hunter Biden\u2019s lucrative contracts with Ukraine \u2014 at the same time the vice president was in charge of U.S. policy toward the country raised \u2014 raised the prospect of fueling a narrative with downside political risk for Biden. \u201cThis puts him on the ropes over having to talk about this,\u201d said Patrick Murray, a pollster with Monmouth University. \u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t want to talk about this, his family.\u201d Murray suggested the ethical dimensions of the controversy \u2014 and the implications of Trump\u2019s actions for impeachment, which Biden at present does not support \u2014 made any extended discussion of the story potentially perilous for Biden. \u201cAt the primary level, I don\u2019t think Democrats would believe these charges [concerning Biden] because of how polarized the debate is right now, but then they could start worrying that this could hurt him if he is the nominee,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018can Biden fight back? Will this hurt his ability to take Trump on fully?\u2019 And will it undermine that electability argument that he\u2019s been making?\u201d\n\nDemocrats are trying to argue that Biden should go on full attack because the two incidents aren\u2019t similar, but that\u2019s poppycock \u2014 and Biden knows it. Remember when his team leaked that he might not run at all because people would attack his family? At the time, the comment was a headscratcher, considered maybe to be just a general commentary on the state of politics as bloodsport these days. In retrospect, it looks much more like a serious attempt to lay the groundwork for an argument that any investigation into Biden\u2019s official actions as VP on behalf of his son\u2019s financial interests would amount to a personal attack on his family.\n\nUnfortunately, Biden can\u2019t have it both ways \u2014 and for that matter, neither can Trump. If Trump abused his office to force Ukraine to go after his political opponent, it\u2019s every bit the same as Biden using his office to protect his son\u2019s financial arrangements with Burisma, and vice versa. It\u2019s a swampy stalemate, and Trump can mostly thank Giuliani for his end of the predicament. If Giuliani hadn\u2019t shot his mouth off over and over about forcing an investigation by Ukraine into Burisma, perhaps the sotto voce approach might have worked and kept Trump\u2019s actions out of the papers.\n\nDemocrats could avoid the whole mess by finding someone else to run against Trump, of course. No one in the top tier has Biden\u2019s draw in the Midwest and Rust Belt, however, and it\u2019s getting very late in the day for a dark horse like Steve Bullock to make a move from the outside. As long as Biden keeps running, Democrats can\u2019t do a thing about this Trump scandal.", "description": "The swampy stalemate.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/biden-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
