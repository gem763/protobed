This is based on the finding of two leopards that were previously spotted in Cauvery.\n\nAnother key recommendation they have made is not to make any more roads along the park as the cases of roadkills are already on the rise.\n\nThey have also suggested that the 3,250 acres of deemed forests, Gullalligudda, BM Kaaval, UM Kaaval Reserved Forests, and Roerich Estate should be together notified as a Conservation Reserve. It will act as a buffer between BNP and human habitations, hence reducing human-wildlife conflict in addition to protecting watersheds.", "description": "The Bannerghatta National Park (BNP) on the outskirts of Karnataka's capital Bengaluru is known as a hotspot for biodiversity.
