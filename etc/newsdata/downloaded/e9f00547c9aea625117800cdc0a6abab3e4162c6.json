Overall, these top 400 wealthy Americans paid just a 23 percent tax rate, which the Times\u2018 op-ed columnist David Leonhardt notes is a combined tax payment of \u201cless than one-quarter of their total income.\u201d\n\nThis 23 percent tax rate for the rich means their rate has been slashed by 47 percentage points since 1950 when their tax rate was 70 percent.\n\nThe analysis finds that the 23 percent tax rate for the wealthiest Americans is less than every other income group in the U.S. \u2014 including those earning working and middle-class incomes, as a Times graphic shows.\n\nLeonhardt writes:\n\nFor middle-class and poor families, the picture is different. Federal income taxes have also declined modestly for these families, but they haven\u2019t benefited much if at all from the decline in the corporate tax or estate tax. And they now pay more in payroll taxes (which finance Medicare and Social Security) than in the past. Over all, their taxes have remained fairly flat. [Emphasis added]\n\nThe report comes as Americans increasingly see a growing divide between the rich and working class, as the Pew Research Center has found.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), the leading economic nationalist in the Senate, has warned against the Left-Right coalition\u2019s consensus on open trade, open markets, and open borders, a plan that he has called an economy that works solely for the elite.\n\n\u201cThe same consensus says that we need to pursue and embrace economic globalization and economic integration at all costs \u2014 open markets, open borders, open trade, open everything no matter whether it\u2019s actually good for American national security or for American workers or for American families or for American principles \u2026 this is the elite consensus that has governed our politics for too long and what it has produced is a politics of elite ambition,\u201d Hawley said in an August speech in the Senate.\n\nThat increasing worry of rapid income inequality is only further justified by economic research showing a rise in servant-class jobs, strong economic recovery for elite zip codes but not for working-class regions, and skyrocketing wage growth for the billionaire class at 15 times the rate of other Americans.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
