The tabloid said that Bayern had been \u201cmerciless\u201d and that the victory had \u201cshocked Europe\u201d.\n\nIrresistible Gnabry shreds Spurs after Lewandowski\u2019s decisive incision | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nMatthias Br\u00fcgelmann noted that Bayern have, in Joshua Kimmich and Robert Lewandowski, leaders who want two win everything, similar to the desire shown by Liverpool when they won the Champions League last season. \u201cThey want to win \u2018the big one\u2019 and that is why they always give everything on the pitch,\u201d he wrote before adding: \u201cand that is why they don\u2019t care if they annoy the top people at the club, the coach or their teammates.\u201d\n\nBild also wrote about Karl-Heinz Rummenigge\u2019s speech after the game and before the dinner, in which he described the performance and result as \u201cmemorable\u201d and added that the team \u201chad made history\u201d.\n\nHe especially thanked the coach, Niko Kovac, who has had a difficult time at Bayern since joining at the start of last season, saying that they had seen something \u201cunbelievable\u201d at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nRummenigge also said that Bayern had proved that a Bundesliga team were capable of beating a top Premier League side and for that he was thankful.\n\nKicker, notoriously stingy when it comes to player ratings, handed out three \u201cEinser\u201d, the best possible mark, to Manuel Neuer, Serge Gnabry and Lewandowski, while Toby Alderweireld suffered the ignominy of being given the rarely seen \u201c6.0\u201d. Son Heung-min was the only Spurs player to escape with a decent mark.\n\nPlay Video 1:26 Ashamed, embarrassed, hurt: Tottenham reaction to 7-2 defeat by Bayern Munich \u2013 video\n\nThe local Munich paper, Abend-Zeitung, said Bayern had won \u201cwith an impressive canter\u201d and there was special praise for Gnabry, who was labelled \u201cthe Fourminator\u201d after his four-goal haul.\n\nBut what was his reward, wondered Patrick Strasser in the same paper. \u201cHis reward seemed to be a sliding tackle from Niklas S\u00fcle that made Gnabry fly out of the pitch as the players celebrated, and then followed the next setback as Javi Mart\u00ednez took the match ball and booted it high into the stands where the Bayern fans were standing. Both actions worthy of a yellow.\u201d\n\nGnabry spoke of \u201cone of the best games of his career\u201d and \u201ca wonderful feeling in what was for us a super night\u201d. The former Arsenal player added: \u201cI could never have dreamed of scoring four in a Champions League game. That is incredible. I haven\u2019t won 7-2 that often and I haven\u2019t scored four in a game since I was playing for the youth teams.\u201d\n\nChristopher Gerards, in S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, took a moment to reflect on those surreal moments in added-on time when it finally dawned on everyone what had happened. \u201cThe Bayern fans started to sing the song that was unavoidable on a night like this. \u2018Dass einer noch reingehe, einer gehe noch reeeiin\u2019 [another one goes] could be heard from the area with the Bayern fans. It is a song that is only sung when a game has lost any tension, when one team has already scored a large number of goals. No more goals came but by then Bayern had already scored enough.\u201d", "description": "There was praise for Serge Gnabry, Joshua Kimmich and Robert Lewandowski as the German press celebrated Bayern\u2019s win", "authors": ["Marcus Christenson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55853113d8f90b409acfd03fedbe3f33104e82a1/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4c597a48afbf0cd075b7678724160880"}
