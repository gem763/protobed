Wouldn\u2019t it be incredible?\u201d asked 22-year-old Valentina Sampaio. \u201cIt would mean that it\u2019s normal and it happens all the time.\u201d\n\nThe Brazilian model has brought us a little bit closer to that future. Victoria\u2019s Secret announced last month that Sampaio would be the brand\u2019s first transgender model.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of these achievements, but this is only the beginning,\u201d Sampaio told HuffPost Brazil in an email. \u201cI am very proud of representing positive change in the fashion industry. It\u2019s important to use my voice and visibility to try and change the status quo, not just in the fashion industry, but in society as well.\u201d\n\nThe model, a native of Fortaleza, a city in northeastern Brazil, has been making waves in the fashion world in recent years.\n\nHer career took off in 2014 with her runway debut at Drag\u00e3o Fashion Brasil, a traditional fashion event in her home state. She caught the eye of the international press two years later by becoming one of the first transgender women to model for L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris; she made her debut at S\u00e3o Paulo Fashion Week that same year. In 2017, she was once again a trailblazer, becoming the first transgender model to make the cover of Vogue Paris.\n\nSampaio told the magazine at the time that the ascent of her career was \u201cvery fast\u201d and surprising. She was just 18 years old when she signed with L\u2019Or\u00e9al.\n\nJoining Victoria\u2019s Secret had long been one of Sampaio\u2019s goals. But it wasn\u2019t easy to reach. She recalls that she had to pass a series of tests before she could become a representative of the brand. She had to complete a challenging virtual casting call first, followed by a formal Skype interview, before she finally got the job.\n\nShe did a shoot with American fashion and portrait photographer Sebastian Kim in New York in June to appear in the Victoria\u2019s Secret Pink catalog.\n\nGABRIEL BOUYS via Getty Images Brazilian model Valentina Sampaio during the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week in Madrid on July 10, 2019.\n\nThe model recognizes these breakthroughs are not just her own, but that her presence in the industry shows that changes have been happening gradually.\n\n\u201cObviously I\u2019m very happy with the changes taking place in our industry. And not just for the trans community. It\u2019s inspiring to see many minorities represented, whether by gender, body type, or ethnicity,\u201d she told HuffPost Brazil. \u201cEveryone needs to be represented in fashion and in society. I feel proud and inspired to be a part of that evolution, and I plan to continue using my voice to push boundaries.\u201d\n\nThese boundaries seem particularly challenging in Brazil right now. The country has the highest rates of homicide of transgender people in the world, according to Transgender Europe, an organization that monitors global violence against trans people. About 163 trans people were murdered in the country in 2018, according to a study by two Brazilian transgender advocacy and education groups. While homicide rates in Brazil are high generally, LGBTQ advocacy groups point out that many incidents of violence are directly related to homophobia and transphobia.\n\nAlthough the trans community continues to be misrepresented and underrepresented in popular media, Sampaio says she hopes her successful career at such an early age will have a positive impact on future generations.\n\n\u201cWe still have a long way to go,\u201d Sampaio said, \u201cbut I believe we\u2019re making some strides toward representation and inclusion, and this needs to continue happening in all areas.\u201d\n\nShortly after Victoria\u2019s Secret announced it had hired Sampaio, Chanel also signed its first contract with a transgender model, with Teddy Quinlivan joining the brand.\n\nThe Victoria\u2019s Secret announcement came on the heels of controversy for the company, which had long been criticized for lacking diversity among its models.\n\nVictoria Secret\u2019s chief marketing officer Ed Razek resigned early last month, almost a year after he was lambasted for saying he would not hire transgender or plus-sized models for the fashion show. His comments inspired trans model Nikita Dragun to protest by making her own \u201cangel\u201d event \u2014 a play on the iconic Victoria\u2019s Secret Angels \u2014 and sharing it across social media.", "description": "The model told HuffPost Brazil that she wants to be a positive force in the fashion industry.", "authors": ["Andrea Martinelli", "Huffpost Brazil"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8bc6e41e0000580072422b.jpeg?cache=krr9f6jrnl&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
