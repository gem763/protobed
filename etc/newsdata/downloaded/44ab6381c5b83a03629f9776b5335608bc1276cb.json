I\u2019m not hugely opposed to them but I\u2019d be content if one was never announced again.\n\nI think I\u2019ve bought one ever, which was The Secret Of Monkey Island one on the Xbox 360.\n\nDespite the constant stream of horror stories about worker exploitation in the industry over the last few years, man hours are ultimately still a finite resource in video game development and every one of them used to produce a remake could have been used on something new instead.\n\nEven with something like the Resident Evil 2 remake, which objectively was a dynamite game, there\u2019s a tinge of disappointment to it because for me it feels like Capcom putting their hands up and saying \u2018we haven\u2019t got it anymore\u2019. Like they\u2019ve forgotten how to build something from the ground up and get people excited about it. Where do they go once they\u2019ve remade them all?\n\nI accept there are shades of grey, like perhaps for storyline reasons a sequel or prequel to a game might not be feasible so the only way to feed the appetite for more that\u2019s out there is with a remake. I also accept that some remakes have got a lot more passion behind them than others, like to bring the game to a wider audience or to right some sort of wrong from the original.\n\nIt also can\u2019t be denied that a remake must often make a lot of financial sense because as we know, nostalgia is usually a pretty bankable commodity. They can also be a means to an end in trying to drum up fan interest in a full-blown sequel.\n\nBut ultimately, they just feel a bit lowest common denominator to me and I\u2019d rather see more risks being taken on new things. I won\u2019t labour the point anymore.\n\nCharlie", "description": "GameCentral readers decide which classic video games they\u2019d most like to see get a remake, from GTA: Vice City to Panzer Dragoon Saga.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/screenshot_1-e035_1571443018.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
