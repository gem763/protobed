Trump\u2019s former United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, appended a tweet critical of Turkey with the hashtag #TurkeyIsNotOurFriend.\n\nTrump said in a tweet that Erdogan will visit Washington on Nov. 13. He also said Turkey makes the steel frame for the U.S.\u2019s F-35 fighter, without mentioning that the Pentagon suspended Turkey from participating in the multinational project after Erdogan purchased an anti-aircraft missile system from Russia over Washington\u2019s objections.\n\nTurkey\u2019s currency, the lira, erased earlier losses and gained as much as 0.8% to a session high of 5.7837 per dollar following Trump\u2019s tweets.\n\nThe White House on Sunday said American troops \u201cwould no longer be in the immediate area\u201d if Turkey moves into Syria, sparking outrage from GOP lawmakers who are normally allies of Trump.\n\nBut on Monday, administration officials who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity sought to minimize the impression created by the commander-in-chief: The U.S. still urges Erdogan not to invade Syria or to attack U.S.-allied Kurdish forces that the Syrian leader considers terrorists, they said.\n\nOnly a few dozen U.S. troops were being pulled back, they said. The Defense Department added that Turkish aircraft have been removed from daily air operations by the U.S. and allies above southern Turkey and northern Syria.\n\nTrump seemed to adjust his message as well, saying Turkey would be held responsible for reining in Islamic State terrorists -- and that he\u2019d \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it did anything he considers \u201coff limits.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Jordan Fabian.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Alex Wayne in Washington at awayne3@bloomberg.net;Nick Wadhams in Washington at nwadhams@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, Justin Blum, Larry Liebert\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump complimented Turkey a day after clearing the way for the NATO ally to invade Syria, calling the country a \u201cbig trading partner\u201d as the White House said its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, plans to visit the U.S. in November.The U.S. president\u2019s posture toward the NATO ally", "authors": ["Alex Wayne", "Nick Wadhams"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
