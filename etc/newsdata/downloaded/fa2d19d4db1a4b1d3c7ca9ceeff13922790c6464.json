He was granted asylum and lived on the property for nearly seven years prior to being ejected in April and promptly arrested by British police at the request of U.S. authorities.\n\nThe Department of Justice has subsequently charged Assange with 18 criminal counts, including several violations of the U.S. Espionage Act related to soliciting and publishing secret military and diplomatic documents, putting him at risk of spending the rest of his life in prison if extradited abroad and found guilty. He has argued he acted as a journalist and is fighting extradition to the U.S.\n\nAssange was under house arrest when he sought asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy, and a British judge ruled that he effectively jumped bail by entering the embassy and punished him accordingly. That prison sentence had been set to expire this month, but he was recently ordered to remain behind bars pending the result of extradition proceedings set to start in February 2020.\n\n\u201cHe was right by seeking asylum, because everything he said that was going to happen happened,\u201d Ms. Anderson said during the television interview. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s in prison.\u201d\n\n\u201cI care a great deal about Julian and I think he\u2019s been psychologically tortured,\u201d added Ms. Anderson, a longtime friend of Assange who visited him several times at the Ecuadorian Embassy and more recently at London\u2019s Belmarsh Prison.\n\nNils Melzer, the United Nations special rapporteur on torture and ill treatment, similarly stated after visiting Assange at Belmarsh in May that he believed the WikiLeaks publisher \u201cshowed all symptoms typical for prolonged exposure to psychological torture.\u201d\n\n\u201cI condemn, in the strongest terms, the deliberate, concerted and sustained nature of the abuse inflicted on Mr. Assange and seriously deplore the consistent failure of all involved governments to take measures for the protection of his most fundamental human rights and dignity,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
