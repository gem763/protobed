In fact, less than one out of 10 referrals to Prevent have resulted in deradicalisation action.\n\nEvery police force can add people to the database, and the Home Office is able to access the information it holds. We don\u2019t know how long the information is held or whether other Government departments or outside organisations \u2013 like the NHS or local authorities \u2013 can access it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis database isn\u2019t about keeping us safe. It\u2019s about keeping tabs on and controlling people, particularly minority communities and political activists.\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how many people this affects, but we do know that in 2017-2018 alone there were 7,318 referrals. Over half of those people were under 20 years old, and one third of referrals were made by the education sector.\n\nThe majority of information on the database is gathered by public servants who have been co-opted by the Home Office under Prevent and encouraged to view even very young children as potential future criminals. Four years ago, a mum arrived at her sons\u2019 primary school to be told her boys were being held in the library, awaiting police questioning. The majority of information on the database is gathered by public servants who have been co-opted by the Home Office under Prevent and encouraged to view even very young children as potential future criminals. The boys had told a teacher who had received training for Prevent that they had toy guns and the school had called the police to alert them to that the children were at risk of radicalisation. After legal action by Liberty on the children\u2019s behalf, the local education authority admitted the boys had been discriminated against and their human rights had been breached. Later, the school also raised other \u2018concerns\u2019; one of the children said he had been to a mosque when he hadn\u2019t and that he speaks Arabic, even though he doesn\u2019t. Worryingly, the teachers failed to understand that even if this was true, these are not signs of radicalisation. The way the system forces teachers \u2013 as well as nurses, doctors and other public servants \u2013 to report purported signs of so-called extremism destroys the trust that should underscore relationships like those between teachers and pupils. It forces teachers to be suspicious, and leaves pupils and their families afraid to speak openly. Along with the Domestic Extremism Database, Gangs Matrix and the massive migrant database, Prevent is just the latest example of the Government\u2019s increasingly totalitarian approach to policing. Ministers and the police must do the right thing and tell people if they are on this database, what information is stored and how this is or will be used. Only then can the Government and police truly be held accountable for what they do with it. Without transparency, it\u2019s near impossible to challenge what\u2019s on the database.

Any review which fails to examine the problematic premise that Prevent was founded on \u2013 or how it\u2019s worked in the past \u2013 can only fail. It\u2019s essential that the option to scrap Prevent and start again is kept on the table. As the first step to show they are serious about getting this review right, Ministers must rethink their appointment of a biased reviewer. Lord Carlile, who is undertaking the review, not only gave Prevent the green light in the first place but has been recorded saying \u2018may be somewhat biased\u2019 towards it. The communities worst affected by Prevent hope for this review to provide the robust, independent scrutiny it desperately needs \u2013 only a truly independent reviewer can deliver that. The Prevent strategy stifles speech, spreads fear and distrust, and encourages discrimination. It will continue to ruin lives until the Government takes action.
