Many analysts say that is unlikely.\n\n\"The latest numbers are not likely to have much impact on the trade negotiations with the US,\" said Ross O'Brien, principal analyst at consultancy firm Intercedent in Hong Kong.\n\nHe said that China is less fixated on top-line growth than the US is, and has for years signalled its intentions to manage a slowdown. Beijing has been trying to curb excessive lending in unproductive areas of the economy that have resulted in dangerously high prices of assets such as property in some parts of the country.\n\n\"All this predates the trade war,\" O'Brien told Al Jazeera.\n\nStill, the uncertainty surrounding trade tensions is likely to continue affecting business decisions, which could further dampen economic prospects for China and its neighbours.\n\nContinuum's Ng noted that any dampening of growth in China has \"always shown an adverse effect on most Asian economies.\"\n\n\"Unchecked, the US-China trade conflict is set to sink growth [in China] well below 6 percent, very quickly,\" Mizuho's Varathan said.\n\nLimited policy measures available\n\nOfficials have focused their attempts to boost growth on limited measures, such as encouraging commercial banks to lend more by reducing the amount of excess reserves they have to maintain with the central bank. And the central bank has been trying to increase lending to small firms.\n\nBut they have appeared wary of expanding the nation's already heavy debt load.\n\nNg doubts there will be any \"big-ticket spending\" by China's government, although it may continue to execute smaller stimulus measures.\n\nVarathan says Beijing will also be reluctant to use stimulus measures such as a drastic devaluation of its currency to boost exports. Doing so could encourage investors to take their money out of China and antagonise the US during the delicately poised trade negotiations.\n\n\"Underlying financial risks constrain ability to fire up full-fledged credit-driven growth,\" he said.\n\nThe likelihood, therefore, of China taking any bold steps to ramp up growth is unlikely.\n\n\"China has been anticipating slower growth for years, and has been carefully managing a gradual slowdown as its economy, which is still growing fast and nearly twice the global average, matures and transitions to one driven by domestic consumption and not exports,\" O'Brien said.", "description": "Ongoing trade tensions with US and limited space for stimulus measures further dampen China's economic outlook.", "authors": ["Samantha Ho", "About The Author"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/6/15/4548b62910864d9f8f28d1732d5ae3ea_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
