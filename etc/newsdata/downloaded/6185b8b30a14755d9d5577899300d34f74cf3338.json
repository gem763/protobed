Defense attorneys presented their case for about two hours on Saturday, the sixth day of the trial of Amber Guyger in the fatal shooting last September of Botham Jean.\n\nGuyger, who was fired after the shooting, testified Friday that she mistook Jean's fourth-floor apartment for her own, one floor below Jean's. Guyger said she thought he was a burglar. The jury is considering whether Guyger is guilty of murder, a lesser crime such as manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide, or if she is not guilty.\n\nProsecutors have argued Guyger never faced a threat from Jean, who was sitting on his couch eating a bowl of ice cream when Guyger entered. Dallas County prosecutor Jason Hermus honed in on Guyger's assertion that she was scared during the encounter, asking her if she could imagine the fear Jean must have felt.\n\nThe jury heard again Saturday from a Texas Ranger called by the defense for about five minutes. The jury is excused until Monday.", "description": "Defense attorneys presented their case for about two hours on Saturday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/27/a3f26fbd-8f08-47c3-b4d0-481fa819892f/thumbnail/1200x630g2/77df013a531a7a3219825b00ebce9bad/ap-19270564287737.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
