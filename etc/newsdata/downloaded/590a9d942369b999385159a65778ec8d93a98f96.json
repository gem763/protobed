The NBA fined the team Tuesday after Bucks general manager Jon Horst said the team planned to give Giannis Antetokounmpo a max offer once he was eligible.\n\nEven though Horst was talking about a player on the Bucks, the timing of his statement violated NBA rules.\n\nBucks get hit with a $50k fine for discussing Giannis\u2019 possible extension. NBA Commish Adam Silver, as we discussed yesterday, has decided to take on tampering https://t.co/SWZUlhpILm pic.twitter.com/F7upfRXlus \u2014 Sam Amick (@sam_amick) September 24, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIn a release, the NBA explained its decision:\n\n\u201cUnder NBA rules, teams cannot commit to offer a \u2018supermax\u2019 extension prior to the summer following a player\u2019s seventh season in the NBA.\u201d\n\nThe 24-year-old Antetokounmpo is slated to begin his seventh season in the league in October. Over his previous six seasons, Antetokounmpo has developed into one of the game\u2019s best players. He\u2019s made the All-Star team in three straight seasons and was named the NBA MVP last year.\n\nAll of that made Antetokounmpo an obvious choice to receive a supermax deal from the Bucks as soon as he was eligible. That will still happen, but don\u2019t expect anyone from the Bucks to talk about it on the record until next summer.\n\nThe Bucks plan to give Giannis Antetokounmpo a max deal, but they can't talk about it now.
