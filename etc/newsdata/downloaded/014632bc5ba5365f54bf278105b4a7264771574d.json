Her prepared remarks were obtained by The Associated Press. She left without answering questions.\n\nNew York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat, said Yovanovitch occasionally had to leave the room because she was overcome with emotion as she was \u201crecounting how she was thrown to the wolves\u201d in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt is clear to me that she was fired because she was a thorn in the side of those who sought to use the Ukrainian government for their own political and financial gain \u2013 and that includes President Trump,\u201d Maloney said.\n\nLawmakers leaving the meeting would not provide specifics from the confidential deposition. But they indicated that Yovanovitch was providing information that would help with the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cIt was compelling, it was impactful, it was powerful and I just feel grateful for the opportunity to have received that information,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Denny Heck, who flew in from Washington state for the interview. He said the eight hours he was there \u201cwent like a New York second.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch \u201cset a very powerful, courageous example,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey.\n\nRepublicans leaving the meeting focused their criticism on Democrats, arguing that the president\u2019s lawyers should be able to attend the hearings and cross examine witnesses. \u201cThis process is a joke, and the consequences are huge,\u201d said New York Rep. Lee Zeldin.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio defended Yovanovitch\u2019s removal from Ukraine, saying the president is entitled to have the ambassador he wants.\n\nThe former ambassador said she was fired from her post after insisting that Giuliani\u2019s requests to Ukrainian officials for investigations be relayed through official channels, according to a former diplomat who has spoken with her. That former diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the private conversation.\n\nTrump, in a July 25 phone call, told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Yovanovitch was \u201cbad news,\u201d according to a partial transcript released by the White House. Neither Giuliani nor Trump has publicly specified their objections to her.\n\nShe said in her statement Friday that she was abruptly told this spring to depart Ukraine \u201con the next plane.\u201d She left her post in May and was later told the president had lost confidence in her and had been pressuring State Department officials for many months to remove her, she said.\n\nDemocrats leading the investigation said they subpoenaed Yovanovitch on Friday morning after learning late Thursday night that the State Department had directed her not to appear. Trump has forbidden all government employees to cooperate, and Yovanovitch remains employed by the State Department. She is doing a fellowship at Georgetown University.\n\nHer testimony in the face of Trump\u2019s opposition won\u2019t be the last as the congressional panels hold a flurry of depositions to investigate the president\u2019s efforts to jump-start foreign investigations that could help his 2020 reelection campaign. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she wants the committees to move \u201cexpeditiously\u201d as they decide whether to move forward with a formal impeachment vote.\n\nPolls show the nation now generally split as to whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office.\n\nOn Monday, Fiona Hill, a former White House adviser who focused on Russia, is expected to appear, and three current State Department officials are tentatively scheduled next week. They include Gordon Sondland, who was blocked from appearing this week but whose attorney said he would testify next Thursday.\n\nAs for Yovanovitch\u2019s dealing with pressure from Washington, the former diplomat who spoke with her said the ambassador refused to do \u201call this offline, personal, informal stuff\u201d and made clear that the U.S. government had formal ways to request foreign governments\u2019 help with investigations.\n\nThe State Department traditionally relies on mutual legal assistance treaties, under which U.S. and foreign officials agree to exchange evidence and information in criminal investigations.\n\nIn her statement to lawmakers, Yovanovitch said that \u201cfalse narratives\u201d had resulted from \u201can unfortunate alliance between Ukrainians who continue to operate within a corrupt system, and Americans who either did not understand that corrupt system, or who may have chosen, for their own purposes, to ignore it.\u201d\n\nShe said she had only \u201cminimal contacts\u201d with Giuliani \u2014 three that she could recall \u2014 and none related to \u201cthe events at issue.\u201d She speculated that \u201cindividuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani\u201d may have believed their personal financial ambitions were stymied by U.S. anti-corruption policy.\n\nTwo Florida businessmen tied to Giuliani were arrested on Thursday and are facing federal charges of campaign finance violations. An indictment filed in the case alleges that the men, who were raising campaign funds for a U.S. congressman, asked him for help in removing Yovanovitch, at least partly at the request of Ukrainian government officials.\n\nYovanovitch also said in her statement that she had never met Hunter Biden and that Joe Biden, the former vice president, had never spoken to her about his son or the gas company with which he was involved.\n\nState Department officials have said previously that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had tried to protect her but was forced to concede when he realized the White House was intent on removing her. Four current and former officials said Pompeo arranged for her to have a \u201csoft landing\u201d after her recall from Kyiv. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the confidential arrangement.\n\nShe met with the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees Friday despite Trump\u2019s declaration earlier this week that he would block all officials from testifying in the impeachment probe. Trump lambastes the investigation daily and now contends it is illegitimate because the full House has not voted on it.\n\nDespite the officials\u2019 expected testimony next week, former Ambassador Sondland\u2019s attorney said he would not be able to produce documents \u201cconcerning his official responsibilities,\u201d as they are controlled by the State Department.\n\nDemocrats want to ask Sondland about text messages released last week that show him and two other U.S. diplomats acting as intermediaries as Trump urged Ukraine to investigate Ukraine\u2019s involvement in the 2016 U.S. election and Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement with a gas company there.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Adam Geller and Jocelyn Noveck in New York and Lisa Mascaro and Padmananda Rama in Washington contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Testifying in defiance of President Donald Trump's ban, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told House impeachment", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/11/e9c147_trump-impeachment-ukraine-ambassador-98290-marie-yovanovitch-ambassador-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
