He wrote: \u201cWhen a poet\u2019s mind is perfectly equipped for its work, it is constantly amalgamating disparate experience; the ordinary man\u2019s experience is chaotic, irregular, fragmentary. The latter falls in love, or reads Spinoza, and these two experiences have nothing to do with each other, or with the noise of the typewriter or the smell of cooking; in the mind of the poet these experiences are always forming new wholes.\u201d Whether such a process exists only in the heads of male poets (very doubtful, I think) or is fundamental to most memory-forming, this \u201camalgamation\u201d certainly seems to be present, swirling and fizzing somewhere in the deep wells where we haul out our poems. Poetry, after all, is much less \u201cabout\u201d a subject than a network of pathways through many subjects and in all directions but \u201cabout\u201d.\n\nTara Bergin provides an endnote in the collection where Drama Lessons for Young Girls appears, one that usefully cross-sections the poem to reveal her triad of sources. These were a visit to an exhibition at the Ashmolean Museum of classical sculpture, Gods in Colour, \u201ca news report on the failure of authorities in Oxfordshire to act on the claims of the abuse of young girls, and attending a lecture given by playwright Margaret Wilkinson on how to read a script\u201d.\n\nSome ideas connect more immediately than others, but affinity doesn\u2019t make transformation easier. Two of Bergin\u2019s themes resonate with each other: the female statues in the Oxford museum who look as if they\u2019ve suffered abuse, and the contemporary girls living in the same county whose actual abuse has been covered up. What makes the connection so forceful, and lifts it entirely above the expected, are the interspersed sets of script-reading instructions.\n\nAnd yet there\u2019s no jarring disruption. Drama and ritual are implicit in the culture the sculptured girls represent, and the poem seems to suggest a botched religious ceremony, from which the girls\u2019 deity has absconded and where they suffer a mutilation that may have been ritual punishment. A small, vital hinge lies in the word \u201ccast\u201d. It occurs twice (lines six and 31) punningly connecting statues to actors (another fused antithesis). It\u2019s suggested that the girl we meet in line five was in fact a real girl who had only been cast \u201cas a young girl from the Acropolis\u201d.\n\nBecause the girls are made to play parts, the story has to be read as an oblique feminist parable, in which they\u2019re damaged by gendered social expectations. The story is told crisply and simply, in a sometimes disingenuous tone, and the drama builds steadily, as the script-reading handbook advises, leaving much unsaid. The dramatic climax is in the sixth stanza, where, unexpectedly, \u201chundreds of girls come bleeding to the door\u201d.\n\nAthena has set her young girls an example of transgressive behaviour. She has run off with the wolves, recalling her part in the myth of Mount Lycabettus and now the maidens are given new parts, \u201ccast as naughty young girls from the Acropolis\u201d, falsely accused and falsely chastised. The story reminds us that colour was the theme of the classical exhibition, and that its presence shocks our piety and aestheticism towards the past. It reminds us of society\u2019s frequent preference for whitewash and silence when contemporary young women report abuse. Significantly, although mutilated and bleeding, the girls continue to succeed in looking like pretty girls. They are doubly miscast, in fact. The speaker\u2019s crisp, faintly didactic style leaves us in no doubt of the subtext. This dramatic monologue is angry but restrained, superbly controlled, coloured by the knowledge of terrible secrets.\n\n\u2022 Drama Lessons for Young Girls was first published in Granta 135, a special issue focused on New Irish Writing. It appears in Bergin\u2019s most recent book, shortlisted in 2017 for the TS Eliot prize and the Forward prize for best collection, The Tragic Death of Eleanor Marx.", "description": "Three strikingly different subjects are fused into one powerful feminist parable", "authors": ["Carol Rumens"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc000890e7e16fa24c962e98a79c79b83fbb98bd/331_0_3533_2120/master/3533.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=01a230c62c8a8e032eb66e8de2512972", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
