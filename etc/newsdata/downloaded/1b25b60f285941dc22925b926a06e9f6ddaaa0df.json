His great passion was his clocks \u2014 he had five grandfather clocks \u2014 and his barometers which were his \u201cchildren\u201d.\n\nMechanic Ron Bell, 66, still lives in an original 1922-built bungalow next door at No. 163, though he\u2019s just leasing it from the new owner who paid $3.3 million for it at auction last December after the death of his mother, Mabel.\n\nMr Bell expects his old home and Mr Bowden\u2019s to have a date with a bulldozer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly the end of an era \u2026 the older homes are disappearing,\u201d he lamented.\n\nFor his part, Ms Raye said old Ernie told her: \u201cI want it to be bulldozed \u2026 I want to raise as much money as we can for the animals.\u201d\n\nAt the grand age of 102, Mr Bowden was declared Australia\u2019s oldest animal activist by Animals Australia.\n\nMs Raye helped him prepare a poster slamming the live trade of animals which went viral on Facebook.\n\n\u201cHe received over 40,000 likes from all over the world,\u201d Ms Raye said.\n\nErnie\u2019s house is just two doors from the five-bedroom luxury Hamptons-inspired residence sold by News Corp Australasia executive chairman Michael Miller and his wife Tonya for $6,575,000 a year ago.\n\nThe result of that auction, through Mr Pallier, had been $570,000 above reserve.
