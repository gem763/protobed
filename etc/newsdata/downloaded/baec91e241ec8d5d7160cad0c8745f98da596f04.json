I understand but there\u2019s no life without risk.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather have more time on my allotment but there\u2019s nothing more urgent than the climate. My grandchildren are my motivation.\n\n\"I have learned too much about what faces them. Whether we can turn this around I have no idea. I increasingly believe that we cannot.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m hoping there will be an awakening.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday Phil was led away for blockading London City Airport. On Monday and last week he was arrested for spray painting the Treasury.\n\nDuring last April\u2019s protests he was nicked four times in 11 days \u2013 once was for gluing himself to the roof of a train.\n\nThe former lecturer and probation officer said he plans to keep getting arrested until he sees \u201creal change\u201d and encouraged others to do the same.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s very important to get arrested. More conventional methods of campaigning are soaked up by the system.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an old man now and I can do anything.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nPhil isn\u2019t afraid of getting prosecuted and ending up in prison.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019d like the experience. I was a probation officer most of my career so I think I may have some things to offer.\u201d\n\nPhil began protesting in 2012 when he co-founded Grandparents for a Safe Earth in his home city of Bristol.\n\nHis wife Cathy died 25 years ago before he began researching climate change but he says he feels she would support him.\n\nDaughter Ann Marie Nyarko, 58, said: \u201cThe worry is always there but we are also very proud. I am glad I can call him my dad.\u201d", "description": "Phil Kingston, 83, has been held three times in the past week alone during demos in London", "authors": ["Jeremy Armstrong", "Image", "Swns", "Pa", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20563905.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_PHIL_KINGSTON_09.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
