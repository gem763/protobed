Pixabay\n\nYou\u2019re at home on a sweltering Sunday, opening a parcel containing the latest designer wear you really wanted \u2013 and you didn\u2019t even need to step out of your house to get it.\n\nFor many, online shopping has become a routine activity, and even more are turning to digital shopping platforms for their everyday needs and wants.\n\nA Facebook-comissioned study by Bain & Company has found that there were 250 million South-east Asian digital consumers in 2018. By 2025, this number is expected to grow to 310 million.\n\nAs part of the study, 12,965 respondents were surveyed across Indonesia, Malaysia, Phillippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, and over 30 CEOs in the region were interviewed.\n\nReleased on Friday (Oct 18) at Facebook\u2019s Marina One office in Singapore, the study also found that by 2025, the increase in South-east Asia\u2019s online spending will outpace the growth of digital consumers by three times \u2013 with clothing, personal care and beauty as the leading categories.\n\nAccording to Bain, the average spend per digital consumer in the region is expected to grow from US$125 (S$171) in 2018 to US$390 by 2025, bringing total online spend to US$120 billion, up from US$31.2 billion.\n\nThe growth in online spend and digital consumers is expected to rise explosively. Bain & Company\n\nDigital spending is discovery-driven, consumers using multiple platforms\n\nAccording to the study, discovery platforms are social channels like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Bain & Company\n\nFacebook said that its study also identified \u201cdiscovery\u201d as a key driver of growth for e-commerce businesses in Singapore.\n\nSandhya Devanathan, country managing director of Facebook Singapore, said that there is no longer just one way to shop, and \u201cdesigning for discovery\u201d is \u201cabsolutely crucial\u201d because customers engage with a business through multiple channels at the same time.\n\n\u201cIn Singapore alone, 75 per cent of the respondents said that they are either open to other brands or will buy from multiple brands when shopping online,\u201d she added.\n\nOn top of that, over eight in 10 respondents said they compare prices across different platforms -including offline \u2013 before they purchase something, and 40 per cent said they have tried an online store they had never heard of.\n\nThe top three reasons for making an online purchase were positive reviews from other users, good deals, and interesting products.\n\nMost respondents said that they were open to buying from other brands. Bain & Company\n\nBusinesses should capitalise on fragmented market by building brand loyalty\n\nBeyond discovery, the study found that South-east Asian consumers shop-hop across 3.8 platforms on average. This is even higher in Singapore, where online buyers shop across 5.1 websites before making a purchase.\n\nAccording to the report, this fragmentation shows an \u201cimmense potential\u201d to build brand loyalty and growth.\n\nRespondents who were loyalty programme members indicated that they are 45 per cent more likely to recommend the brand or product. Around 25 per cent said that their purchasing frequencies are more likely to increase if they are rewards programme members, and a further 20 per cent said they would spend more.\n\nAdditionally, shopper experience also helps e-commerce firms retain brand loyalty. Praneeth Yendamuri, partner at Bain & Company, said the use of gamification, such as those used by Shopee, can help to add a different element into the shopping experience.\n\n\u201cBrands need to be very savvy and re-imagine their marketing and trade spend to be in sync with the ever-evolving omnichannel consumer journey.\n\n\u201cThey also need to build new muscles to ensure a positive online shopping experience to their digital consumer,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the study, e-commerce sites from the US and China have the highest market share in South-east Asia. Facebook said this showed that there is \u201cimmense potential\u201d to build brand loyalty and growth in South-east Asia.\n\nSingapore has a 1.7x market share, as compared to the US\u2019 6.5x.
