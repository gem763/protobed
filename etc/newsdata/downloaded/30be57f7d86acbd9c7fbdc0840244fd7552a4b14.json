I believe it\u2019s driven not so much by subsidies as by genuine desire of the public to have silent and non-polluting vehicles.'\n\nDyson\u00b4s new campus at at Hullavington Airfield in Wiltshire (Fred MacGregor/PA)\n\nDyson said today that its sites including Malmesbury, in Wiltshire, and its Singapore facility will be expanded and the company will concentrate on the 'formidable task' of manufacturing solid state batteries and other technologies.\n\nHe added: 'In summary, our investment appetite is undiminished and we will continue to deepen our roots in both the UK and Singapore.'", "description": "Sir James Dyson has scrapped his bold plan to make a Tesla-rivalling electric car as it would not be commercially viable.", "authors": ["Simon Lambert For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
