PCG, +1.23% previously said it would begin precautionary power shutoffs affecting nearly 180,000 homes and businesses in portions of 17 counties, mostly in the Sierra foothills and north of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe outages will last about 48 hours, the utility said.\n\nMeanwhile, Southern California Edison said it could cut power Thursday to more than 308,000 customers in seven counties, and San Diego Gas & Electric was warning of power shutoffs to about 24,000 customers.\n\nThe utilities say they\u2019re concerned that winds forecast to top 60 mph could throw branches and debris into power lines or topple them, sparking wildfires.\n\nPG&E cut power to more than 2 million people across the San Francisco Bay Area in rolling blackouts from Oct. 9-12, paralyzing parts of the region in what was the largest deliberate blackout to prevent wildfires in state history. Schools and universities canceled classes and many businesses were forced to close.\n\nPG&E\u2019s new warning just two weeks later prompted feelings of frustration and resignation among some residents and business owners and renewed rushes to stock up on batteries and other emergency supplies.\n\nLove Birds Coffee & Tea in the old Gold Rush town of Placerville lost about $6,000 in the last outage \u2014 a huge chunk of change for a mom-and-pop business and a hit from which the store hasn\u2019t yet recovered, owner Garrett Sanders said.\n\n\u201cWorking this close to the last outage is going to be a true trial by fire,\u201d he said.\n\nThis time, Sanders plans to brew coffee and stock up on handmade pastries before the shut-off, then sell them on the sidewalk \u2014 along with a smile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a sober morning for people waking up without their coffee,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do, like, all of our espressos and milk-based drinks but we\u2019ll have coffee. It\u2019ll be better than nothing.\u201d\n\nSanders said he is sympathetic to the argument that the outages are designed to prevent wildfires, especially since a dozen people settled in Placerville after they were burned out of the town of Paradise by a fire that killed scores of people last year.\n\n\u201cOf course, none of us wants the devastation\u201d of a wildfire, Sanders said, \u201cbut I think the measures that PG&E is taking are to the ultimate extreme.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin sent a sharply worded letter Tuesday to Bill Johnson, PG&E\u2019s CEO, blaming the unprecedented mass outage earlier this month on the company\u2019s failure to maintain and upgrade its equipment.\n\n\u201cI believe the unacceptable scope and duration of the previous outage \u2014 deliberately forcing 735,000 customers to endure power outages \u2014 was the direct result of decades of PG&E prioritizing profit over public safety,\u201d Newsom wrote, referring to the number of businesses and households affected, not the total number of people.\n\nPG&E says the shutdowns are not about money.\n\nThe only goal \u201cis to prevent a catastrophic wildfire,\u201d Johnson said in a Tuesday briefing.", "description": "The state\u2019s largest utility began another widespread blackout Wednesday that could affect hundreds of thousands of people as dangerous fire weather returns...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT896_powerl_ZG_20191023195326.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
