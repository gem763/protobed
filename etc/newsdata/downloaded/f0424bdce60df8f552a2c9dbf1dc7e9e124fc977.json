The stock had risen more than 17% this year but is down more than 13% over the past year.\n\nChanos, whose firm manages around $2 billion in assets, said in 2017 he was betting against dialysis companies. Thursday market the first time he revealed DaVita as one of his short positions.\n\nDaVita did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is DaVita's largest shareholder. The conglomerate owns 24% of the company's shares outstanding. Ted Weschler, a portfolio manager at Berkshire, is responsible for the position.\n\nWeschler told CNBC's Becky Quick in a 2014 interview that \"You got an incredibly talented team running that company. I'm not sure what the stock will do over the next year or the next two years, but very comfortable at five years from now it'll be a more valuable franchise.\"\n\nChanos bashed Berkshire for its stake in DaVita. On Thursday, he noted DaVita's earnings per share have not grown over the past 10 years, adding this is \"a very bad look for an insurance company like Berkshire Hathaway to be promoting a company that I think is running an insurance scam.\"\n\nCNBC reached out to Berkshire for comment.\n\n\u2014CNBC's Alex Crippen contributed to this report.", "description": "DaVita shares fall to their session lows following Jim Chanos' comments at the Delivering Alpha conference.", "authors": ["Fred Imbert"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106138846-1568907930799img_9463.jpg?v=1568908322", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
