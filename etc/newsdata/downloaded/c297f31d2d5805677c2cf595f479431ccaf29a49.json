REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nTrump\u2019s suggestion on Sunday that Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) or another U.S. oil company operate Syrian oil fields drew rebukes from legal and energy experts.\n\nThe United States will strengthen its military presence in Syria with \u201cmechanized forces\u201d to prevent Islamic State fighters seizing oil fields and revenue, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Friday.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif addressed the issue at a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday evening after meeting with his counterparts, Russia\u2019s Lavrov and Turkey\u2019s Mevlut Cavusoglu.\n\n\u201cWell it seems that the United States is staying to protect the oil. And at least President Trump is honest to say what the United States intends to do,\u201d Zarif said to laughter.\n\n\u201cIran and Russia are there on the invitation of the Syrian government, and we intend to stay there as long as the Syrian government and Syrian people want us to be there,\u201d he said.\n\nLavrov said that the return of U.S. forces to Syria, after their transfer to Iraq, was \u201cunder the pretext of protecting oil deposits from the Islamic State.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe essence is that any illegal exploitation of natural resources of a sovereign state without its consent is illegal and that is the view that we share,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur U.S. colleagues are aware of our position and we will defend that position,\u201d Lavrov said.\n\nFahrettin Altun, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s communications director, said in a tweet later on Tuesday: \u201cSyria\u2019s natural resources belong to Syrians.\n\n\u201cOil or other types of revenue should be used for reconstruction efforts including local infrastructure, support for civilians, IDPs (internally displaced persons), and refugees. Just as Syrians should be able to determine their own political future, they should also be allowed to decide how the resources of their own land should be spent,\u201d Altun said.\n\nThe United States Special Envoy for Syria Joel Rayburn, speaking to reporters in Geneva earlier on Tuesday, voiced concern at what he said was the \u201ccontinuing dangerous situation in northeast Syria\u201d and urged all sides to work to stabilise the situation.", "description": "Iran and Russia on Tuesday condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to maintain a military presence near oil fields in northeastern Syria, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov saying any exploitation of resources would be illegal.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay", "Babak Dehghanpisheh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446328769&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1YM", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
