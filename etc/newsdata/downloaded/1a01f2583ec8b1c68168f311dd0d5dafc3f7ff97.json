After Donald Trump was elected we heard many of his supporters saying they felt unseen in our politics. They aren\u2019t alone. Many low-income and working-class people \u2013 black, Latinx, Native, Asian, as well as many white folks \u2013 feel unseen in our politics.\n\nWe often bemoan the low voting rates in this country, and we try to fix it with more money for voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives. These are important strategies and I support them, but they don\u2019t address the more fundamental fact that people do not see themselves or their concerns represented in our politics.\n\nThat is why People\u2019s Action, the working-class people\u2019s organization where I serve as director, has created a new kind of presidential debate. Last month, more than 2,000 people gathered in person \u2013 with thousands more watching via the Guardian\u2019s live stream \u2013 for a People\u2019s Presidential Forum in Des Moines, Iowa, hosted by People\u2019s Action, Iowa CCI Action Fund and Student Action.\n\nIn a candidate-centric political culture, we want to make sure that we can hear the voices of the people, not just the voices of candidates. This radical approach seems to be working. The Nation\u2019s John Nichols described the People\u2019s Presidential Forum with a word not often associated with politics: \u201cpoignant\u201d.\n\nNichols writes: \u201cThe format \u2013 the most impressive I have seen at a forum so far this year \u2013 had the candidates listen to testimony from immigrants, refugees, fast-food workers, daughters caring for ailing parents, moms struggling to find adequate housing, and people who have been racially profiled. Farmers who were well into their eighties and LGBTQ+ students who were just into their 20s asked precise questions about issues raised by the testimony. There were no moderators, no panels of cable news show hosts, no \u2018gotcha\u2019 questions.\u201d\n\nIn a much-needed twist, we asked candidates to agree that there would be no stump speeches \u2013 or any speeches, for that matter\n\nThe forum was emceed by Barb Kalbach, a fourth-generation family farmer, registered nurse and Iowa CCI Action Fund board president. She was joined by Lizeth Chac\u00f3n, director of Colorado People\u2019s Action, who moved to the United States from Mexico when she was 12. Lizeth\u2019s father has worked at a meat-packing plant for 19 years, and her mother has struggled with punishing medical debt. And, like many in mixed-status families, Lizeth has lost family members to deportation in the last year.\n\nIn a much-needed twist, we asked candidates to agree that there would be no stump speeches \u2013 or any speeches, for that matter. Big kudos goes out to Pete Buttigieg, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren for agreeing to this format.\n\nCandidates spent roughly the same amount of time listening as talking, and all their answers had to respond to personal experiences from everyday people from all walks of life.\n\nDana Burtness, a Minnesota family farmer and member of Land Stewardship Action, described how a 5,000-sow factory farm fouled the waterways near her home and asked Warren how she plans to save family farms from extinction.\n\nIowa: progressives to the fore as Sanders and Warren attend 'people's forum' Read more\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna break up big ag,\u201d Warren told her. \u201cWe have the laws to break up big ag, and I have the courage to enforce these laws. We\u2019re going to adopt the policies that will let our farmers be good stewards of the earth, and we need Washington to be a good partner in this.\u201d\n\nKelvin Dunigan, a member of Iowa CCI Action, told Buttigieg how he was racially profiled by Des Moines police. He felt humiliated, and feared for his life.\n\n\u201cThis is about whether community members feel that they can trust those who are sworn to keep them safe, and whether there will continue to be systematic disempowerment of black people in our country,\u201d Buttigieg answered. Buttigieg has joined the call to ban racial profiling in Des Moines.\n\nLillian Cheesman is a member of Citizen Action of Wisconsin who told Castro how she left a law firm to care for her mom, who has Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt feels like getting stabbed in the heart when she doesn\u2019t recognize who I am,\u201d Lillian told Castro. \u201cWhat I need is what millions do: respite care \u2013 someone qualified to come in, even for just a few hours a day \u2013 or intergenerational daycare. I wouldn\u2019t make any other choice; I just wish we had more support.\u201d\n\nCastro listened, then endorsed Lillian\u2019s call for Universal Family Care.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure that as the baby boomer generation turns 65, we have a plan to make sure they\u2019re well taken care of. And that includes a place to live, it includes good healthcare,\u201d Castro answered.\n\nJuliza Cortes shared how she had walked 2,000 miles to escape gang violence in El Salvador, only to be forced to sleep standing up in a cell with 17 other pregnant women. Sanders listened attentively to Juliza, and apologized to her. \u201cWe have a president who believes he can win re-election by demonizing, by criminalizing you,\u201d he said. Then he pledged to fight for comprehensive immigration reform and abolish Immigration Customs and Enforcement (Ice).\n\nIf we truly want more people to engage in elections, we need to center people in the process. As many said at the forum, we have found the leaders we are looking for, and it\u2019s not the candidates, it\u2019s all of us.\n\nOur next People\u2019s Forum will be in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 26 October.", "description": "The biggest reason for low turnout is that people don\u2019t feel represented in our politics.
