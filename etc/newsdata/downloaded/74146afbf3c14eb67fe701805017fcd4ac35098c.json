In the United States, Oyo is rebranding the Hooters Casino Hotel in Las Vegas as its own.\n\nAgarwal has said India and China account for two-thirds of the company\u2019s total revenue, while a fifth comes from Europe and the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, as the company pushes for profits, many hotel owners who partnered with it complained of their income being hurt by higher fees Oyo charges them.", "description": "Indian hospitality startup Oyo, backed by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp <9984.T>, announced on Monday a $1.5 billion deal with its existing investors that will tighten the founder's control and provide fresh capital to the money-losing firm.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438008274&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960I5", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
