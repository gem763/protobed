Adam Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, who is spearheading the investigation.\n\nTrump, who as recently as last week said, somewhat incomprehensibly, that \u201cNancy Pelosi, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is no longer the speaker of the House,\u201d more recently has fired off multiple tweets attacking Schiff, on Monday suggesting he could be arrested for inaccurately summarizing Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE & terrible statement, pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President, and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nTrump was reacting to Schiff\u2019s opening statement at last Thursday\u2019s Intelligence Committee hearing, saying it amounted to putting words into his mouth.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t Congressman Adam Schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to Congress as if this statement, which was very dishonest and bad for me, was directly made by the President of the United States? This should never be allowed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\nHere is the complete video of Schiff\u2019s opening statement, in which he describes \u201cthe essence of what the president communicates\u201d in his call with Zelensky.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear what crime Trump is imputing to Schiff. Members of Congress are given broad immunity for anything they say on the floor of the House or Senate. Republicans called on Schiff specifically to explain a passage in which he paraphrased the substance of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, using quotes that were never actually spoken:\n\n\u201cWe've been very good to your country. Very good. No other country has done as much as we have. But you know what? I don't see much reciprocity here,\u201d Schiff, interpreting the president\u2019s meaning, said Trump essentially told Zelensky. \u201cI will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing, and they should be helping you more than they are.\u201d\n\nSchiff explained that his statement \u201cwas meant to be, at least in part, in parody.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that that\u2019s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself,\u201d Schiff explained. \u201cOf course, the president never said, \u2018If you don\u2019t understand me I\u2019m going to say it seven more times.\u2019 My point is, that\u2019s the message that the Ukraine president was receiving in not so many words.\u201d\n\nTrump and his press secretaries have frequently explained away his controversial statements as a joke and accused his critics of lacking a sense of humor \u2014 most conspicuously, in his public request during the campaign for Russia\u2019s help in locating emails deleted from Hillary Clinton\u2019s account.\n\nLike the summary released by the White House of Trump\u2019s self-described \u201cperfect\u201d call with Zelensky, the debate over Schiff\u2019s characterization of it has broken down along partisan lines.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and President Trump (Photos: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images, Chris Kleponis/CNP/Bloomberg via Getty Images) More\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer and most vocal defender, Rudy Giuliani, who has been asked to supply documents to the committee, said Sunday that he would refuse to cooperate with an investigation headed by Schiff.\n\n\u201cI think Adam Schiff should be removed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they remove Adam Schiff, if they put a neutral person in, who hasn\u2019t prejudged the case, if they put someone in, a Democrat who hasn\u2019t expressed an opinion yet \u2014 if I had a judge in the case and he had already announced I\u2019m going to impeach, if he already went ahead and did a whole false episode, wouldn\u2019t I move to recuse that judge?\u201d\n\nAs a former prosecutor, Giuliani knows that to open an impeachment inquiry \u2014 the equivalent of a grand jury investigation \u2014 involves at least a presumption of wrongdoing on the part of the target. Otherwise why bother? The role of the judge, or jury, in an impeachment proceeding falls to the Senate, if and when the House passes a resolution of impeachment.\n\nIf Giuliani is looking for an example of a legislator who has already made up his mind in advance, he could look to the Senate\u2019s second-ranking Republican, Sen. John Cornyn, who was described by one of his home-state newspapers as \u201cone of Trump\u2019s most outspoken Twitter defenders.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n", "description": "The president continues to rail over Rep.
