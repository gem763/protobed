Now we need a five bed home.\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\n\u201cWe were a family of seven allocated a three bedroom house, and one of the rooms is a box room with half of it being taken up by the stairs, it\u2019s more like two and a half bedrooms.\u201d\n\nShaffina Hassam, her husband Sajid and their five children, three daughters aged 17,16 and 14 and two boys aged 12 and 10, share the house in North Evington.\n\nHer son Mohammad Yaseen is in remission after receiving treatment for a rare cancer. It\u2019s something that has added to Shaffina\u2019s worry about their living situation.\n\n\u201cMohammad has to have a colostomy bag because of the treatment, we only have one bathroom and we don\u2019t have a shower in there.\n\n\u201cAnyone who knows about the bags will know that showers are much more hygienic and dignified for a boy in his situation.\n\n\u201cI have his bags, dressings, medications all out on show because there\u2019s two of them in a bedroom barely big enough for one person.\u201d\n\nMohammad\u2019s oncologist has also written to the council advising them that he needs his own room meaning the family need a five bedroom house - something in short supply.\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\nIn 2018/19 there were just five lettings of five bedroom homes, there are currently 122 families waiting for one, 27 are a higher priority than the Hassams.\n\nShaffina\u2019s daughters also struggle for space.\n\nShe said: \u201cMy three girls are all in full time education still, they all share one bedroom, they have bunk beds and a pull out bed - one of them sleeps on a pull out bed.\n\n\u201cThere are three teenage girls in a room together, they are all still studying. There\u2019s no room for a desk in there, there\u2019s not much room for anything.\u201d\n\nShaffina said she has already been waiting years for a bigger house. The city council confirmed they applied to the housing register in 2017 and have been bidding on properties since then.\n\nThey were originally band three, a lower level of need, but were moved into band two when Mohammad became poorly.\n\n(Image: BPM Media)\n\nShaffina said: \u201cI bid each week on properties that are available. In the past I\u2019d think about things like schools and staying in the same area but it\u2019s got to the point now where I\u2019ll think about moving anywhere so we don\u2019t have to live like this any more.\u201d\n\nShaffina also said she has asked for her existing home to be adapted or extended.\n\n\u201cIf we could extend and have a downstairs bathroom and create an extra bedroom we\u2019d be happy to stay here.\n\n\u201cWe realise that there are lots of other people waiting for housing but it\u2019s really difficult living like this.\n\n\u201cOne bedroom between seven of us would be a struggle anyway but with Mohammad\u2019s needs it\u2019s even harder.\u201d\n\nA city council spokesman said: \u201cThis family registered for a move in 2017 and have been a high priority for a move since 2018 but five-bedroom homes are in desperately short supply across the city, with only five coming available across the whole of the city in the past year.\n\n\u201cWe are going to talk to them about considering bidding for four bedroom houses rather than just five-bed, which would at least provide one extra bedroom.\n\n\u201cWe are also in the process of buying up private properties to add to our housing stock, and are looking for five-bedroom and adapted properties, as well as bungalows, because of the growing need for them.\n\n\u201cWe have recently established a pot of money to enable us to extend and adapt some of our homes , and are currently looking at our stock to see where this is physically possible and where there is greatest need.\n\n\"We can look at this family\u2019s house as part of that review with a view to seeing if it is possible to extend it.\u201d", "description": "The family of seven are living in a three-bedroom council house in Leicester", "authors": ["Amy Orton", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Bpm Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20751522.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Shaffina-Hassam.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
