One thing led to another and they introduced me to someone else running a start-up, and I also invested in that,\" he said.\n\n\"All the maths shows to have a decent portfolio you need at least 25 investments.\n\n\"Through Investible's fund they'll be able to back 40 start-ups, so you'll get that diversification, as well as their experience and due diligence.\n\nMr Lederer said regardless of how much money an angel investor had, they would struggle to be able to back 40 companies due to the time commitment needed to conduct due diligence and then continue to support and advise the budding start-ups.\n\n\"I have just under 30 investment and I've found it's almost unmanageable,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"With the club model, it's easier because you can leverage off other people's knowledge and experience.\"\n\nEstablished in 2014 by former Blueprint Management Group entrepreneurs Mr Price and Mr Folsom, to join the Investible club must be able to commit $100,000, but most are not accepted unless they can invest $250,000.\n\nThe club uses 16 criteria to guide its investments, incorporating 250 data points, covering the strength of a start-up's business model plan, pitch, investor deck and the chemistry of the founders.\n\nThe members choose which companies they want to back, how much they're going to contribute to the capital raises and are also involved in sourcing the deals.\n\nMr Veytsblit joined Investible in 2017, having worked in early stage start-up advisory previously where he recognised a funding gap for companies just starting out.\n\n\"Seed funding is the stage where we're a little short ... People who have scaled and exited a business are the best people to have around you at an early stage,\" he said.\n\n\"But we need more education around the potential benefits of investing early and education for angels about how to do it the right way. Investing in seed makes sense when you're diversifying your risk.\"\n\nA report commissioned by Victorian state government-funded body LaunchVic released last week revealed investment in seed-stage deals dived from $280 million in 2016-17 to less than $90 million the following year, despite more money going into venture capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Investible fund has an initial deployment period of three years in which it intends to make 40 to 45 investments of around $300,000 each, but it then also has the capacity to make larger follow-on investments in between seven to 10 companies around $750,000 to $1 million.\n\nMost venture capital funds in the country focus on Series A raises and later, although some like Blackbird Ventures do also make seed investments.\n\nMr Veytsblit urged more funds to consider investing earlier and following their portfolio companies through the life cycle.\n\nHe said the most common thing that killed start-ups before they ever get going is a lack of product market fit.\n\n\"Usually the founders have misread the need for their solution, or they've created something where there isn't enough of a problem. It's the vitamin versus the pain killer,\" he said.", "description": "Investible has closed its first VC fund above its initial target, as it aims to de-risk angel investing to attract more early stage investors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4536%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_338%2C$y_179/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0dd48c7593cc25d7e5672600df6ec1fa7814b971", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
