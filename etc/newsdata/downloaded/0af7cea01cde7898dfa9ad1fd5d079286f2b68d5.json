They got a good result last week, but Brighton also beat Spurs at home 3-0 recently, so it\u2019s going to be a difficult match for Everton.\n\nDimitar\u2019s prediction: 1-2\n\nBetfair Exchange match odds Brighton: 34% (2/1) Draw: 29% (12/5) Everton: 37% (13/8)\n\nWatford vs Bournemouth\n\nWatford were unlucky last time out at Spurs. Sometimes teams just have a winning mentality, others don\u2019t and they suffer, even if they are playing well. At the moment for me, Watford need to find that but I can\u2019t see it against Bournemouth this weekend.\n\nDimitar\u2019s prediction: 0-1\n\nBetfair Exchange match odds Watford: 44% (5/4) Draw: 26% (11/4) Bournemouth: 30% (12/5)\n\nWest Ham vs Sheffield United\n\nSheffield United beat Arsenal last time and nobody saw that coming, it just shows that anyone can beat anyone in the Premier League, West Ham will be up for it after a poor showing last time out but it\u2019s not going to be easy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDimitar\u2019s prediction: 1-1\n\nBetfair Exchange match odds West Ham: 46% (11/10) Draw: 27% (11/4) Sheff United: 27% (11/4)\n\nBurnley vs Chelsea\n\nThey love their team up in Burnley and it can be a tricky place to go but for me Chelsea are performing really well. Lampard is counting on the young talent in the team and although N\u2019Golo Kante is missing again through injury, Jorginho has really stepped up in recent weeks.\n\nDimitar\u2019s prediction: 0-2\n\nBetfair Exchange match odds Burnley: 21% (7/2) Draw: 23% (100/30) Chelsea: 56% (4/5)\n\nNewcastle vs Wolves\n\nWolves had a great result midweek and they are on a bit of a run but they could be mentally and physically tired, St. James Park is a big stadium and the fans there really give their team a lift and because of that I can see both teams sharing the points for this.\n\nDimitar\u2019s prediction: 1-1\n\nBetfair Exchange match odds Newcastle: 32% (2/1) Draw: 31% (11/5) Wolves: 37% (7/4)\n\nArsenal vs Crystal Palace\n\nIt was good to see Pepe producing for Arsenal midweek because he has had faced a bit of criticism recently, I like him though and he\u2019s fast and runs at people. Arsenal\u2019s confidence will be high and I think they will have too much for Crystal Palace.\n\nDimitar\u2019s prediction: 3-1\n\nBetfair Exchange match odds Arsenal: 66% (1/2) Draw: 20% (4/1) Crystal Palace: 14% (6/1)\n\nLiverpool vs Tottenham\n\nLiverpool are probably in the top five teams in the world right now and I think it will be very tough for Spurs to take something. They will be in their faces straight away at Anfield with Mane, Salah, Firminho and everyone behind them, they are going to run like crazy and pressure them, so they need a good plan to approach that game. I think Liverpool will continue with their unbeaten run.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDimitar\u2019s prediction: 2-1\n\nBetfair Exchange match odds Liverpool: 65% (8/15) Draw: 20% (4/1) Tottenham: 15% (6/1)\n\nNorwich vs Manchester United\n\nNorwich will show no respect and will try to go at United. But as long as Solskjaer\u2019s team they keep their shape and form, their winning DNA is still there, they know how to score one goal and take the three points and I think this is one of those games where they will be happy with that.\n\nDimitar\u2019s prediction: 0-1\n\nBetfair Exchange match odds Norwich: 21% (7/2) Draw: 25% (3/1) Man United: 54% (5/6)", "description": "The Premier League's big guns all fared well in Europe during midweek but there is no respite for title-chasing pair Liverpool and Manchester City, while the race for the top...", "authors": ["Dimitar Berbatov"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_92246419_1572016199.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
