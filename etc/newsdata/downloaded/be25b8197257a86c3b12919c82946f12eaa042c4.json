He was previously the head of AMP's financial services division during a 13-year career at the financial services group.\n\nWhile the royal commission's 2018 final report found that AMP had charged customers fees for no service between 2008 and 2015 and criticised its audit practices, Mr Dunn was not personally found liable for any misconduct.\n\nCGI said Mr Dunn's time running AMP's financial services division before 2008 \u201cwould have afforded him significant insight\u201d into its financial advice business while he was the company's CEO.\n\nCGI also last year recommended against Mr Dunn's re-election to the Westpac board, which he joined in June 2015. Some 35 per cent of Westpac shareholders subsequently voted against his re-election.\n\n'Qualified support'\n\nBut Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has given \u201cqualified support\u201d for Mr Dunn's re-election to the Telstra board, arguing it was not clear whether AMP's misconduct occurred under his watch.\n\nThe Australian Shareholders Association (ASA), which represents retail investors, has also backed Mr Dunn's re-election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nASA guidelines require consideration of whether a CEO \u201chad been demonstrably responsible for key decisions which have led to poor performance over a sustained period\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe do not consider that this link has been demonstrated,\u201d the ASA said. The organisation also noted Telstra had been transparent about Mr Dunn\u2019s resume.\n\nBut the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors is against another term for Mr Dunn.\n\n\u201cThe performance of AMP over the past decade, and the royal commission process, have highlighted the poor outcomes AMP delivered to shareholders and many customers,\u201d ACSI said.\n\nThat included AMP\u2019s share price being 20 per cent lower when he finished than when he started \u201cduring the middle of the GFC\u201d, ACSI said. The council also noted AMP had started reviewing advice dating back to 2008, and associated provisions were most recently priced at $670 million.\n\nStill, ACSI said Telstra representatives had maintained Mr Dunn \u201cwas no longer at AMP \u2018long before\u2019 issues arose and no evidence has been raised indicating his culpability\u201d.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the board discussed the matter with Mr Dunn who was open, transparent and reflective, commenting that they would not support board members if they felt they would cause disrepute or embarrassment to Telstra,\u201d ACSI said.\n\nDirectors up for re-election under ordinary resolutions need more than 50 per cent of votes to be cast in their favour to continue sitting on a board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTelstra has this year garnered support for its remuneration report, potentially avoiding a second \u201cstrike\u201d against pay. That is when more than 25 per cent of votes are against the remuneration report two years in a row, triggering a board spill.\n\nAdvisory groups including CGI, ISS and the ASA have supported Telstra's new pay scheme. ACSI said reforms included reducing maximum potential pay by 20 per cent for chief executive Andy Penn and 13 per cent for other executives.\n\nTelstra also issued one of the \u201cbest examples of disclosure\u201d around bonuses of any ASX-listed entity, ACSI said. The telecommunications company disclosed its bonus scorecard and targets as the year started.\n\nBut ACSI detailed governance concerns about \u201caccounting risk\u201d given the jump in use of \u201creverse factoring\u201d, in which companies use a financier to quickly pay supplier bills.\n\nThe suppliers will be paid earlier by the financier if they take a discount on the total amount due. The system helps the billed company lengthen and smooth out its own cash flows.\n\n\u201cTelstra\u2019s cash flow received a significant benefit from extending payment terms for its suppliers \u2013 from a disclosed maximum of 45 to 90 days \u2013 in conjunction with a rapid increase in the use of \u2018reverse factoring\u2019 arrangements,\u201d ACSI said.", "description": "The banking royal commission fallout continues with shareholder advisers split over re-electing Craig Dunn as a Telstra director.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/002fcd16b3c16fab235bd5f4a3140c3b63128da4", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
