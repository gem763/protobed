Now that order is being recorded on paper and put into action.\n\nThat may cause some political difficulties for the president, but it's clear he believes the potential damage from not following through on his 2016 border-wall campaign pledge - even if the funds are coming from US taxpayers, not Mexico - is greater than the risk of disgruntled constituents and interested parties.\n\nIt wasn't too long ago that border walling was a non-controversial proposition, tucked into larger spending legislation. That was before Donald Trump made it the most visible embodiment of his immigration policies, however.\n\nMr Trump has already tweeted aerial video of new border wall construction (technically, just replacement barriers). His goal is to have even more footage to point to - and, perhaps, stand smiling alongside - as his 2020 presidential re-election campaign picks up steam.\n\nWhat is being defunded?\n\nIn a letter released on Wednesday evening, first reported by The Daily Beast, Mr Esper identifies 127 projects that stand to lose funding at the expense of the border wall.\n\nThis list includes projects across 23 US states, three US territories and 20 countries. More than $1bn in mainland projects - with a wide array of purposes -will likely be shelved, including $40m to update hazardous waste storage in Virginia and $95m for an engineering centre in New York.\n\nNearly $700m will be diverted from projects in US territories Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam. Of these Puerto Rico will be hit hardest: the island stands to lose $400m worth of planned projects.\n\nApproximately $770m will be taken from projects across Europe, directed at helping allied countries deter a possible attack from Russia.\n\nNine projects overall affect the renovation and replacement of schools for children on US military bases across the world.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon, the affected projects have not been cancelled outright but have been \"deferred\".\n\nFor the projects to be resumed, however, Congress must agree to do so in its annual defence policy bill. If Congress fails to do so, they will be stuck in legislative limbo and effectively defunded.", "description": "The US president made building a wall a major campaign pledge but it has faced stiff opposition.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4C54/production/_108604591_gettyimages-1164452134.jpg"}
