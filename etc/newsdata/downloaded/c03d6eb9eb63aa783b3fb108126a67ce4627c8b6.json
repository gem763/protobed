At the last election, most of his inner team thought on election night that Theresa May was heading for a large majority. Nick Brown, Labour\u2019s chief whip, is said to have argued against backing an election at shadow cabinet this morning.\n\nBut this is a tactic, not a real change in Labour\u2019s view. The ground was cut from under Corbyn\u2019s feet by Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, and Ian Blackford, the Commons leader of the Scottish National Party. It became clear overnight that Boris Johnson had the votes he needed for a December election, so the shadow cabinet had to decide whether to accept it or to go to the polls having opposed the idea.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAnd the Lib Dems and SNP have reasons of their own for wanting an early election. Both parties stand to gain seats. The Lib Dems are at 18 per cent in national polls, twice the 8 per cent share they won last time. The latest poll in Scotland suggested the SNP would gain 13 seats to take 48.\n\nThey even have arguments of principle for backing an election. It may be that an election is the best hope of preventing Britain leaving the EU. Swinson and Blackford can point to the vote last week for the principle of the legislation to put Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal into effect.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

If the Conservatives and DUP together lose just seven seats compared with 2017 (and assuming the Brexit Party doesn\u2019t make up the losses), then there will be a majority for Labour\u2019s plan to hold a second referendum.\n\nBut the hard truth is that this is an election that Labour MPs do not want. They have been betrayed by the SNP, in echoes of 1979, when an SNP motion of no confidence in James Callaghan\u2019s government triggered its downfall seven months early. Many Labour MPs will refuse to vote for an election today, but Corbyn has already been on TV welcoming the challenge.\n\nThis election is what Boris Johnson wants. The Dominic Cummings faction in 10 Downing Street has won out, and the Cummingsesque side of the prime minister\u2019s brain has prevailed. If Johnson had written two articles, in favour of and against an early election, he would have preferred the one in favour.\n\nIt would have set out the argument of his chief of staff that a December election is Johnson\u2019s best chance to win a secure majority. He can fight it on a clear message of promising to deliver a Brexit that has been blocked and delayed by a naysaying parliament.\n\nIn the other article setting out the arguments for an election after Brexit, Johnson would have noted that the voters rarely reward politicians for delivering what they want. He probably would have quoted his hero Winston Churchill, thrown out by an ungrateful nation after winning the war.\n\nJohnson starts this campaign in a commanding position, but he should worry about holding an election when it is not strictly necessary. He may be right that parliament, having voted for his Brexit deal in principle, would have dithered and delayed in practice. But he never tested MPs\u2019 willingness to agree a more reasonable timetable for his bill. The voters did not like May holding an election when she did not need to. Will they be more forgiving of Johnson?", "description": "No sooner had I written about the election paradox \u2013 that, if it looks as if one side will win, the other side won\u2019t vote for an election \u2013 than Jeremy Corbyn decided his side would vote for an election after all.", "authors": ["John Rentoul"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/23/boris-johnson-loses-election-vote.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
