They should, a perfect call \u2014 got them by surprise!\u201d Suffice it to say, there were no apologies after the release of the Memorandum of Telephone Conversation (TelCon) between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. This isn\u2019t a verbatim transcript, and it\u2019s always possible that it was doctored in some way, but what is revealed in its five pages is deeply damaging to Trump.\n\n\u201cThe United States has been very very good to Ukraine,\u201d Trump tells Zelensky with an undertone of menace. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very.good to Ukraine.\u201d Eager to placate Trump, Zelensky thanks him \u201cfor your great support in the area of defense.\u201d \u201cWe are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.\u201d (The Javelin is an antitank missile.)\n\nThe very next words out of Trump\u2019s mouth are: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.\u201d Quid, meet quo. Trump is explicitly tying U.S. military aid to Ukraine to Ukraine\u2019s willingness \u201cto do us a favor.\u201d He then makes clear that the \u201cus\u201d he is referring to is not the United States of America. It is the Trump campaign.\n\nJosh Rogin: The White House\u2019s Ukraine memo destroys Guiliani\u2019s attempts to frame the State Department\n\nTrump refers to a ridiculous conspiracy theory that the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email server has somehow wound up in Ukraine and says, \u201cI would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.\u201d In other words, Trump is politicizing the U.S. legal system and compromising U.S. national security by demanding that the president of Ukraine cooperate with the Justice Department in a far-fetched attempt to absolve Russia of having hacked the DNC \u2014 and Trump of having won in 2016 with Russian help. \u201cWhatever you can do, it\u2019s very important that you do it if that\u2019s possible,\u201d he emphasizes.\n\nTrump leaves no doubt that, in addition to relitigating the 2016 election, he wants the Ukrainians to help him win in 2020: \"There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nZelensky tries to placate Trump by assuring him that the next prosecutor \u201cwill be 100 percent my person.\u201d Trump doesn\u2019t give up. \u201cI will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I\u2019m sure you will figure it out.\u201d Trump stresses the point once more before they hang up: \u201cI will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.\u201d\n\nDavid Ignatius: This isn\u2019t just another spat. Trump compromised our security for his gain.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Trump didn\u2019t say, \u201cIf you expect to see any more aid from us, you\u2019d better investigate Joe Biden and Clinton,\u201d but the threat came through loud and clear, given that at least a week before, he had put a hold on nearly $400 million of aid to Ukraine. On the call itself, Trump pivoted from Zelensky\u2019s request for missiles to Trump\u2019s request for an investigation of his political opponents.\n\nTrump did no business on behalf of the United States on this call. He did not once mention any desire to root out corruption in Ukraine or achieve any other foreign policy objective. It was all campaign business \u2014 dragging a foreign head of state and his own attorney general into his desperate efforts to win reelection and remove any taint from his initial election. As Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, notes: \u201cThe transcript of the call reads like a classic mob shakedown.\u201d\n\nThe TelCon, far from absolving Trump, greatly strengthens the case for impeachment. If this is supposed to be exculpatory, can you imagine what the inculpatory material contained in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint looks like? What\u2019s truly astonishing is that Trump could have thought anything else. The most devastating aspect of this rough transcript is that Trump didn\u2019t realize how devastating it would be for him.\n\nThat shows he literally has no idea of what a president is supposed to do \u2014 and not do. Recall that Trump\u2019s former secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said Trump often made illegal requests. The Trump-Zelensky phone call is Exhibit A.\n\nRead more:\n\nGreg Sargent: New revelations on Trump call and Giuliani make impeachment more likely\n\nJennifer Rubin: Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president should seal his fate\n\nAlexandra Petri: Donald Trump might get impeached?
