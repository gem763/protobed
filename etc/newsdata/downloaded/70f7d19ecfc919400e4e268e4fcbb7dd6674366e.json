They were adjusted after it came to Walker's attention that she had violated the rules by having her caddie line her up on the putting surface at the Pete Dye Course.\n\nWalker incurred a two-stroke penalty for each time it happened, adding 42 strokes to her opening score of 85 on Monday and 16 additional strokes to her second-round score on Tuesday. That's a total of 58 penalty strokes.\n\nLPGA rules official Marty Robinson said another caddie in the group informed Walker of the rules infraction midway through the front nine of her second round.\n\nSCORES: Senior LPGA Championship\n\nWalker then brought the situation to an official's attention on the 14th hole (her fifth), Robinson said.\n\n\"We had her recreate the times that that happened,\" said Robinson.\n\nEarlier this year, the USGA and R&A implemented a change that prohibited caddies from lining up a player on the putting surface under Rule 10.2b.\n\nLee Anne Walker's adjusted scorecard from her first round at the 2019 Senior LPGA Championship.
