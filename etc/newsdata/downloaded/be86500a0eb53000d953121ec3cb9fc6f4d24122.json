He paid another $50,000 in bribes to get her into the University of Southern California as a water polo player. He was set to pay another $200,000 as part of the scheme, but was arrested before the deal was finished. (His daughter was ultimately not admitted.)\n\nActor Felicity Huffman, who last month became the first parent to be sentenced in the scam, got 14 days in prison, a $30,000 fine and 250 hours of community service. Three other parents sentenced so far were given one to four months in prison for trying to bribe their kids\u2019 way into schools. \u201cFull House\u201d actor Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, have also been accused of paying bribes to get their daughter into college, and have pleaded not guilty.\n\n\u201cThe outrage in this case is a system that is already so distorted by money and privilege in the first place,\u201d the judge said last month in handing down Huffman\u2019s sentence. \u201cIn a system in that context, that you took the step of having one more advantage to put your child ahead.\u201d\n\nEarlier Friday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation meant to make the college admissions process more fair in the state. One bill requires colleges to disclose whether they give preferential treatment in admissions to applicants related to donors or alumni. Another bans those found guilty in the admissions scandal from getting tax deductions for donations they made as part of the scheme.", "description": "The judge\u2019s sentence was the most severe yet for a parent in the elite college bribery scandal.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d97bace210000330030d72d.jpeg?cache=vuhgy8bc1p&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
