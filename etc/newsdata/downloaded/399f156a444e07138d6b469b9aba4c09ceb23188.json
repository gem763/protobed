Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has scurried across the globe over the past year to deliver, time and again, a blunt reminder that the world is not doing enough to combat climate change \u2014 and to implore leaders to act with more urgency.\n\n\u201cWe still lack the global political will to take the kind of transformational measures necessary to make these trends be reversed before it is too late,\u201d he warned an audience in Beijing in April.\n\n\u201cClimate change is running faster than our efforts to address it,\u201d he said during a May visit to Fiji, where he\u2019d come to witness the impacts of rising seas on small island nations.\n\n\u201cWe are in a battle for our lives,\u201d he said in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, in June.\n\nA much-anticipated climate summit at the United Nations on Monday will test whether Guterres\u2019s relentless campaign to nudge nations toward more aggressive climate action is working. It also will help reveal whether the world\u2019s nations, which came together to sign the Paris climate accord in 2015, can muster the resolve to slash carbon emissions as rapidly as scientists say is needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change.\n\n\u201cThis is not a regular meeting of the U.N.,\u201d Luis Alfonso de Alba, a Mexican diplomat whom Guterres appointed as a special envoy for the summit, said in an interview. \u201cThis is a sounding of the alarm at the highest level.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Guterres has demanded that the countries attending Monday\u2019s summit bring with them promises of tangible action, such as vowing to reach net zero emissions by 2050, scaling back fossil fuel subsidies and halting construction of coal-fired power plants.\n\n\u201cI told leaders not to come with fancy speeches, but with concrete commitments,\u201d Guterres told reporters this week. \u201cWe are losing the race against climate change. Our world is off track.\u201d\n\nU.N. officials have said that only the countries that have promised meaningful new pledges \u2014 probably about 60 nations \u2014 will be allowed one of the three-minute speaking slots throughout the day.\n\nThat means high-profile nations such as the United States, which has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement next year, will not be invited to weigh in.\n\nBan Ki-moon, the former U.N. secretary general who made finalizing the Paris accord one of his top priorities, said Guterres is taking a hard line with countries in an effort to extract ambitious commitments ahead of a major climate summit next year. At that gathering, nations will be asked to increase the initial pledges to cut carbon emissions they made five years earlier in Paris \u2014 pledges that were nowhere near enough to keep global warming from rising two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.\n\nDe Alba said the main goal of Monday\u2019s gathering is to demonstrate that the \u201ctransformative\u201d actions necessary to combat climate change do exist.\n\n\u201cWe need to demonstrate that it is possible to make these changes,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the same time, however, a group of nearly three dozen prominent figures \u2014 including Ban and Microsoft founder Bill Gates \u2014 called the Global Commission on Adaptation will use the summit to press for measures to cope with the impact of climate change that has happened or is inevitable.\n\nMonday\u2019s summit comes amid a growing focus on climate change around the world and mounting pressure to address it, including among young activists and corporate investors.\n\n\u201cIf there is a silver lining, it is that the reality of the worsening impacts around the globe and dire predictions of impacts to come have galvanized a global citizen movement calling for climate action from their leaders,\u201d Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, wrote in a blog post ahead of Monday\u2019s summit. \u201c. . . In short, the real world is moving faster than the politicians.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, hundreds of thousands of teenagers around the world are expected to hold demonstrations to push for more urgent climate action. Among the largest of those protests is the one that will be led in New York by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nIn testimony before Congress this week, Thunberg submitted a report from a U.N.-backed panel of scientists that found nations must take \u201cunprecedented\u201d actions to cut their carbon emissions over the next decade to keep the world from racing past warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over preindustrial levels.\n\n\u201cI am submitting this testimony because I don\u2019t want you to listen to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you to listen to the scientists. And I want you to unite behind the science. And then I want you to take real action.\u201d\n\nIf the world is to meet the aims of the Paris agreement, real action will be a necessity. A recent U.N. report found the current pledges from countries leave the world on track for a rise in emissions of more than 10 percent above 2016 levels by 2030 \u2014 a trend sharply at odds with pleas for deep cuts.\n\nAt the same time, there are signs of rising ambition in corners of the globe. For instance, the same report found that at least 112 nations, representing 53 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, have signaled an intention to revise their plans for combating climate change over the next decade.\n\nOf course, one major world power notably absent is the United States, which under President Trump has relinquished its role as a global leader in pushing for climate action. Trump has insisted the Paris accord would have hurt the United States financially and said the nation already has a stronger environmental record than most other countries. (It is also the world\u2019s second-largest emitter of carbon, behind China.)\n\nTrump has the support of many Republican lawmakers. Even those who concede that man-made climate change is real remain reluctant to support actions they say are not reciprocated by countries such as China or India.\n\nRep. Garret Graves (La.), the ranking Republican on the House Select Climate Crisis Committee, said in a statement after the hearing on Wednesday that \u201cwe need aggressive and sustainable action that\u2019s grounded in more science \u2014 not less.\u201d He also lamented that \u201cfor every ton of emissions we cut, China adds four tons: more than offsetting what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nAsked about the U.S. absence, Guterres found slivers of optimism.\n\n\u201cIt is very important for the United States to come back to the Paris agreement. But that is not only a question for the government; it\u2019s a question for the whole of American society,\u201d he said, adding that he was inspired by the positive changes being made by cities, states and the business community.\n\nUltimately, Guterres said Monday\u2019s summit is the latest step in the long fight to avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change, for people who are already feeling its effects and for generations to come.\n\n\u201cI have three grandchildren,\u201d the 70-year-old leader of the United Nations said, \u201cand I don\u2019t want to be responsible for them to live in a semi-destroyed planet when they come to my age.\u201d", "description": "U.N.
