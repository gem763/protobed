The missile hit its target after more than 500 kilometers (310 miles) of flight, the Pentagon said.\n\nThe test would have been previously banned under the now-defunct Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. Officials stressed that the missile is designed to carry a conventional payload, not a nuclear one.\n\nThe US withdrew from the INF Treaty with Moscow earlier this month after years of accusing Russia of violating the treaty via its deployment of its nuclear-capable SSC-8 missile. The arms control pact had limited the development of ground-based missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers.\n\nRead More", "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to prepare a \"symmetrical response\" to a recent US test of a cruise missile, the Kremlin said in a statement Friday.", "authors": ["Mary Ilyushina", "Nathan Hodge", "Ivana Kottasov\u00e1"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190816122849-02-putin-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
