You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nPayday lenders have long been the target for consumer groups as well as regulators for pilling excruciatingly high interest loans on those least able to pay them back. QuickQuid\u2019s interest rates had been as high as 1,300 per cent.\n\nThe financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, introduced tighter rules for payday lenders in 2014 and 2015, including more robust affordability checks on applicants and a cap on the total a business can demand in repayments to twice the original amount borrowed.\n\nBut the number of complaints made against QuickQuid has soared in recent years, according to data from the financial ombudsman. Between the second half of 2017 and the second half of 2018, the number of people making formal complaints, including demands for compensation, rose from just over 1,500 to more than 5,700.\n\nWith a total of 10,400 complaints made against the firm over 2018, QuickQuid was the most complained-about banking and credit firm in Britain last year.\n\nBy comparison, Wonga\u2019s compensation claims \u2013 widely accepted as the key reason for its collapse \u2013 merely doubled in the year before the administrators were called in.\n\nSome 40,000 complaints were made about the payday industry in 2018-19 and, crucially. the ombudsman typically upholds somewhere between 60 and 70 per cent of them a year.\n\nFinancial fight back\n\nCommenting on the QuickQuid reports, Peter Briffett, co-founder and CEO of the income streaming app Wagestream, said: \u201cThis is another nail in the coffin of the payday loans industry and a fantastic day for consumers.\n\n\u201cThose under financial pressure are better informed and more financially literate than they\u2019ve ever been and there has never been a wider variety of alternatives to payday loans available.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, the amount of free financial education available online has ballooned in the past five years as financial services companies have started to realise the value of offering greater guidance to customers.\n\n\u201cQuickQuid\u2019s demise is symptomatic of this disappearing knowledge gap as well as a dramatic shift away from exploitative interest rates.\n\n\u201cAfter Wonga\u2019s collapse, and now QuickQuid\u2019s woes, this finally looks like the twilight of this greedy industry.\u201d\n\nTwist of fate\n\nThere\u2019s only one snag. If QuickQuid had somehow survived, there was decent precedent for refunds and or compensation. Back in 2015, CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid and Pounds to Pocket, agreed to redress almost 4,000 customers to the tune of \u00a31.7m after the regulator raised concerns about the firm\u2019s lending criteria.\n\nMore than 2,500 customers had their existing loan balance written off and more almost 460 also received a cash refund. (The regulator had said at the time that the firm had also made changes to its lending criteria.)\n\nBut experts are warning those pursuing complaints against QuickQuid may now never see the compensation they believe is owed to them.\n\nAfter Wonga\u2019s collapse, administrator Grant Thornton revealed that 40,000 alleged victims of misselling were unable to compensation.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re currently claiming compensation from QuickQuid for a missold loan you will need to wait until the administrators have wound up the company,\u201d says Tola Fisher, personal finance specialist at money.co.uk. \u201cUnfortunately, you might find yourself at the back of a long queue to get hold of your money.\u201d\n\nConsumers who are paying back a loan can\u2019t relax either. Their accounts will most likely be bought by another business and the repayments will still have to be made. Sadly, you can\u2019t just stop paying.\n\n\u201cMake sure you stick to your repayment plan and pay up on time, otherwise you could face extra fees and charges,\u201d adds Fisher.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to remember that if you miss repayments this could harm your credit rating as future lenders look at how you\u2019ve managed your existing credit when making a decision to lend or not.\u201d\n\nThe Money Advice Service provides information on alternatives to high-cost payday loans.", "description": "A massive increase in the number of people demanding compensation for alleged missold loans has forced the closure of yet another payday lending giant.
