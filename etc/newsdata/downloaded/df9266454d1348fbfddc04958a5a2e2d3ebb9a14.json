I'm signing off.'\n\nFans of the star quickly rallied with supportive tweets, urging him to come back soon.\n\n@Loobylou65 urged: 'Don't sign off! Keep talking, keep crying if you need to. We're listening! Xx'\n\n@ZitahM penned: 'Hope there's someone with you in your sign-off so you can talk when you need to.'\n\n@ChazH8593 added: 'Hang on in there John and ride through the storm; feel the love and care that people here are offering you in support. You are definitely not alone.'\n\nEarlier this year, Whaite revealed the impact winning the then BBC cooking show at just 23 had on his mental health.\n\nAlthough he insisted he'd do it all over again, the former-law student urged this year's hopefuls to 'be careful what you wish for'.\n\nIn August, Whaite (pictured during his former cookery spot on Lorraine) revealed that every year following his win on the show his appeal would diminish as new bakers came through\n\nIn a column for the Telegraph, he wrote that 'as the next batch of Bake Off starts emerged, my appeal shrank. Year on year, the working days became fewer and financial offers were smaller. The life to which I had become accustomed slowly dissolved.'\n\nIn August, the star, from Chorley, Lancashire, made a plea for help on Twitter following the disappearance of his older sibling Victoria Cunningham at Faro airport.\n\nAt the time he tweeted: 'My sister has gone missing from Faro Airport. We are all worried for her welfare. Portuguese police aren't interested in helping us search for her.'\n\nMiss Cunningham was eventually found by a stranger, alive but 'very, very distressed'.\n\nJohn (pictured, left) made an appeal in August after his sister, Victoria Cunningham (pictured, right) went missing in Portugal, later revealing she was found and returned home safely\n\nThe TV star shared this desperate plea with his followers on Twitter\n\nMr Whaite tweeted: 'Sister is home and safe and so it\u2019s now business as usual. Thanks again for all your love and help. If you want more info on PMDD see @viciouscyclepmd.'\n\nMr Whaite said she was suffering form a hormonal-based illness known as Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD).\n\nIn a follow up tweet, he said: 'We are now going to focus on getting her home and back in good health in the privacy and protection of our family.\n\n'My gratitude to each one of you is undying. You've helped save a sister, a daughter and a mother - thank you.'", "description": "The 2012 Bake Off star took to social media on Tuesday to say that he was suffering with a 'serious bout of depression' telling his 90,000 followers 'I'm signing off'.", "authors": ["Jo Tweedy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/10/19483714-0-image-a-12_1570614510969.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
