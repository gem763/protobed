There is now the real prospect of England salvaging a draw from the series and maintaining their five-year unbeaten record on home soil.\n\n\n\nJofra Archer was England\u2019s star, proving once again that when he is on song he is among the most dangerous bowlers in the world. The challenge for England\u2019s strategists is to ensure the all-format weapon is physically capable of hitting that sort of form regularly, and for Joe Root (or someone in England\u2019s party) to become an Archer whisperer and understand how to coax out those game-changing spells on matchday.\n\n\n\nBut as much as Archer\u2019s six-for dominates the scorebook, the hustle of Sam Curran should not be overlooked. The Surrey allrounder provided some welcome variation to England\u2019s attack with his left-armers but it was his infectious enthusiasm that shone. Diminutive and babyfaced Curran resembled an eager puppy learning how to bare his teeth in sibling combat, but it was long overdue aggression, especially to Steve Smith. It\u2019s a shame Curran has been the only newcomer on display in south London with his youthful exuberance restoring some pep to a line-up that looked weary at Old Trafford.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of Smith, he continued his extraordinary summer with another half-century (natch), but it is a measure of his mind boggling form that 80 is now considered something of a failure. Once again the rest of Australia\u2019s top order struggled, ramming home the point that this series will rightly be remembered as one of the all-time great individual performances.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know the drill by now, I\u2019m around for an hour or so but when play begins Adam Collins will take over.
