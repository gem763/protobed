Snyder worked for J.Crew when the brand first rented the space in 2008, and watched it become a gathering place for menswear enthusiasts from around the world.\n\n\u201cThis place is special to me, and to menswear in general,\u201d the fashion designer told the Cut before his store\u2019s opening this week. It was a place for discovery, for like-minded people to gather and geek out over clothes \u2014 not to mention an architectural gem. When Snyder eventually decided to leave J.Crew in 2009 and launch his own label, the store\u2019s success had a lot to do with it. \u201cI wanted a chance to have my own crack at it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe \u201cFOR SALE\u201d sign seemed to say that his chance had arrived. So he went straight to its owner \u2014 a third-generation New Yorker who still lives part-time above the space. He told her his plans to \u201ckeep it alive.\u201d He wanted to preserve the integrity of the architecture, but also give the shop a new life. She approved. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s always been about paying homage to something that\u2019s original, but then upgrading it,\u201d Snyder said of his aesthetic.\n\nPhoto: John Keon Photo/Courtesy of Todd Snyder\n\nThe building was originally built in the early 1800s, eventually becoming a liquor store in the back and a barber shop in front. (Way ahead of its time.) It\u2019s now a New York City landmark building, which means the facade is basically frozen in time. \u201cWe can\u2019t even touch the door handles,\u201d said interior designer James Mills. Even the new gold \u201cTodd Snyder\u201d lettering in the window had to be painted by hand, just like the original.\n\nMills said that Snyder \u2014 who studied architecture before switching to fashion design \u2014 made a master Pinterest board for decorating the space. He wanted it to look like an old men\u2019s club in London, but \u201cmixed in a New York way.\u201d The main upgrades include reclaimed French oak floors, coffered ceilings, and and a coat of \u201cmilitary olive\u201d paint (the brand\u2019s signature color) throughout. It\u2019s got a distinctly downtown feel in comparison to the Madison Avenue flagship \u2014 a little more \u201cmoody,\u201d as Snyder describes it.\n\nThere are also items exclusive to the space, including a custom-embroidered bowling shirt and a Champion sweatshirt with a chain stitch \u201cLiquor Store\u201d logo on it. Customers will also be able to experience made-to-measure bespoke tailoring, just like the good old days.\n\nAnd of course, there will be booze. \u201cAs soon as you come in, the first question is: What would you like to drink?\u201d Synder said. But within reason. This is 2019, after all. And Snyder is a good neighbor.\n\nPhoto: John Keon Photo/Courtesy of Todd Snyder", "description": "Menswear designer Todd Snyder, who used to work for J.Crew, bought the brand\u2019s old Liquor Store space in Tribeca as soon as he saw that the landmark space was back on the market.", "authors": ["Emilia Petrarca"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/13/todd-snyder/LS-Ext.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
