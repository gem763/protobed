Itoje says he has teammates who have been the target of abuse and believes the time has come for more black sports people to take a public stand.\n\nJonny May reaches England 50 and reflects how missing a big night out paid off Read more\n\nThe Saracens forward, preparing for the biggest game of his life in the shape of the World Cup quarter-final against Australia on Saturday, has been sickened by events in Bulgaria and is urging rugby to do more to combat racism and discrimination of all kinds.\n\nAs a keen football fan Itoje has particular sympathy for the England footballers who were abused during their Euro 2020 qualifier in Sofia on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s just appalling, it\u2019s abysmal,\u201d said the London-born 24-year-old, whose parents hail from Nigeria. \u201cYou would think they wouldn\u2019t have to go through that. It sends a poor message about the game of football \u2026 it\u2019s a shame because it\u2019s such a beautiful game and it\u2019s being tarred by people with racist thoughts and racist minds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible that players have to experience that when they just want to go out and play the game they love. It is important that those who are subject to this kind of abuse and discrimination speak up and highlight the wrongs and the issues. I also think associations and teams need to take a tougher stand. Punishment needs to be more severe because it is not acting as a deterrent, especially when they go abroad to places like Bulgaria. They need to make it crystal clear.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nAccording to Itoje, that is equally the case in rugby. While he acknowledges that \u201cfor the most part in rugby there\u2019s a different climate and that kind of stuff doesn\u2019t happen\u201d, he suggests the sport needs to remain vigilant.\n\n\u201cI know people in rugby who have experienced it in the professional game \u2013 not necessarily in the Premiership but playing in different parts of the world \u2013 and grass roots. In rugby you don\u2019t have microphones everywhere so it\u2019s hard to prove.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important never to just assume that this is a free zone from any form of discrimination. I think rugby is probably, from the sports I\u2019ve seen, right up there in terms of integrity, respect and how they treat people. But I think it is important to never just assume that it\u2019s always going to be that way. -\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure, a couple of years ago, when this sort of thing wasn\u2019t as rife in football, they assumed it was all OK. I remember a period when I didn\u2019t really hear much about racism in football but then over the last two years there have been several incidents with Raheem Sterling, Dele Alli and with a whole number of black players who play for England or in the Premier League. It is important never just to assume that these things are all hunky dory \u2013 it is something we have to keep on top of.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Maro Itoje rides a challenge during England\u2019s match against Argentina.

Itoje has been impressed with how Mings has handled the situation. \u201cI\u2019m all for player empowerment, I\u2019m all for players speaking up when they feel there are injustices done to them. It is important for players who are subject to this kind of abuse and discrimination that they speak up and highlight the wrongs and the issues.\u201d\n\nBilly Vunipola looks set to start against Australia after training boost Read more\n\nSuch forceful opinions have even greater resonance in a week when England are preparing for their most significant game for four years. Itoje has been involved in numerous big matches for club, country and the British & Irish Lions but, at this moment, the looming encounter with the Wallabies on Saturday tops the lot.\n\n\u201cIt feels huge,\u201d he acknowledged, looking ahead to his first taste of World Cup knockout rugby. \u201cThis is a scenario I haven\u2019t been in before, which is partly why it is so exciting for me. You don\u2019t think about tomorrow or three years ago. What is important is what is in front of you and what you have to deal with.\u201d\n\nHe also hopes to repay some of the faith Eddie Jones has shown in him, whether or not that means collecting a few more of the \u201cbattle scars\u201d his coach has previously suggested all truly world-class warriors need. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t have too many battle scars \u2026 I would like to leave rugby blemish-free,\u201d Itoje joked. \u201cI definitely don\u2019t want to end up looking like [the forwards coach] Steve Borthwick. That would be a sad day for me.\u201d", "description": "England\u2019s Maro Itoje has slammed this week\u2019s racist abuse in football and warned rugby union should not consider itself immune from similar problems", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d9293276dce850e427a2c5687d38ff8eeeb847b/442_50_2474_1484/master/2474.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=03914fb2079026afa439f59e29f8ee8a", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
