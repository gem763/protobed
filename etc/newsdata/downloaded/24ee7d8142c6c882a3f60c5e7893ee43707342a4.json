Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into digging up dirt on the president\u2019s political rival.\n\nHill said Bolton, who instructed her to raise the matter with White House lawyers, even likened Giuliani to a \u201chand grenade,\u201d according to two people familiar with her testimony. Hill also testified that Bolton wanted to make clear he was not involved and very opposed to what he described as the \u201cdrug deal\u201d between Mulvaney, and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who were also involved in the effort, the people said.\n\nSome lawmakers and congressional aides have spoken privately about possibly summoning Bolton and Mulvaney to testify, although they deferred to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on next steps.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.\n\nConversations about deposing Bolton and Mulvaney come as Democrats weigh whether to hold a full House vote for an impeachment inquiry, a step that is not required by the Constitution or House rules.\n\nTrump and Republicans have repeatedly criticized Democrats for refusing to hold a formal vote as has been done in past impeachments of presidents. The White House has cited the absence of a vote in refusing to comply with subpoenas for documents and witness summons.\n\nDemocrats, who returned from a two-week recess Tuesday, began discussing the idea of putting Republicans on record by holding the vote. Aides to House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) have begun reaching out to lawmakers to gauge interest, according to two Democratic aides.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have suggested that the House schedule a vote to defuse that criticism, but others are wary of bowing to Republican pressure on the issue \u2014 noting that Trump's defenders will simply move on to criticize other aspects of the probe. Some aides are also reticent to change course after House lawyers who are seeking access to grand jury records generated by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III recently argued to a federal judge that a formal vote is not necessary for the House to enjoy the full legal rights it is afforded in an impeachment proceeding.\n\nDiscussions about next steps comes as the Pentagon, Office of Management and Budget as well as Vice President Pence face a Tuesday deadline to turn over all documents pertaining to Ukraine. Giuliani has also been subpoenaed for relevant materials, though his lawyer told Congress Tuesday that he would not comply.\n\nMany of the revelations about Bolton\u2019s stance were first reported by the New York Times.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump ousted Bolton last month after a rocky relationship in which the two men clashed over policy toward North Korea, Iran and Afghanistan, among other issues. The president even disparaged Bolton as he left, saying he made \u201csome very big mistakes.\u201d\n\nBolton, who initially declined to comment, said in a text: \u201cI will have my say in due course.\u201d He is reportedly writing a book.\n\nAccording to one person familiar with Hill\u2019s testimony, Bolton was so alarmed by the efforts of Giuliani, Sondland and Mulvaney to circumvent the NSC and diplomatic corps that he dispatched her to raise the concern with White House lawyers.\n\nThe order came after then-special envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker, Bolton, Sondland, Hill and Energy Secretary Rick Perry met in early July. During the meeting, Sondland blurted out to the other officials present that there were \u201cinvestigations that were dropped that need to be started up again\u201d in Ukraine, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter. The officials understood him to be referring to Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, and former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden, who sat on its board.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBolton went \u201cballistic\u201d after the meeting, the official said.\n\nHill herself got into a confrontation with Sondland over his involvement in Ukrainian affairs, according to one person familiar with her testimony, as Ukraine is not in the European Union and thus not part of his ambassadorial portfolio. Sondland said he had been put in charge by Trump, the person said \u2014 something Hill likened to the bravado of when Alexander Haig, then secretary of state, said he was in charge after a 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan.\n\nSondland, who obeyed State Department orders not to show up for a planned deposition last week, is expected to testify in the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry Thursday under subpoena. Text messages provided to the panel by Volker showed it was Sondland who defended the president in early September, when other diplomats expressed concern that U.S. military assistance was being withheld from Ukraine to push Ukrainian leaders to conduct a politically motivated investigation of Burisma.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHunter Biden served on Burisma\u2019s board for five years; Joe Biden is currently making a 2020 White House bid.\n\nTrump told Mulvaney in mid-July to hold back almost $400 million in congressionally approved military aid for Ukraine. That order came the same week that Hill resigned from the NSC; it also took place one week before Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by phone on July 25, when he appeared to pressure Zelensky to investigate the Bidens and purported Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether the White House will attempt to block parts of Sondland\u2019s testimony by asserting executive privilege over the president\u2019s interactions with the ambassador. But any claim of privilege could be distinctly weakened by the White House\u2019s decision to release a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe White House could have also missed an opportunity on claiming privilege over Sondland\u2019s conversations, by failing to assert privilege over Volker\u2019s testimony. If lawyers for Sondland \u2013 or eventually the courts \u2013 decide that means the president waived his right to claim privilege over the matters that were discussed in the texts Volker shared with the committees, Sondland would be able to speak freely.\n\nThe White House sent Hill letters in advance of her deposition Monday warning her about respecting executive privilege, though it was never claimed officially to the committee. For those in government, testifying even as the White House asserts privilege could come with professional consequences, but the White House has essentially no way to punish former officials \u2013 unless the information they share is classified, in which case disseminating it could be a crime.\n\nGreg Miller contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Former top NSC official Fiona Hill testified that Bolton wanted it to be clear he was not involved in the \u201cdrug deal\u201d on Ukraine being cooked up by others, including Trump\u2019s chief of staff, according to people familiar with her testimony.", "authors": ["Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZCNyQ4pbCp_COqFBFIjFL__LFUI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TLJ7PEFKJMI6TBZTJDEHENPTSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
