An example of this is harbours.\n\nEconomists.co.za\u2019s chief economist Mike Sch\u00fcssler is critical about how much there is for taxpayers to get excited about.\n\nHe points out that the tariff for the transport of petrol from the coast to Gauteng has increased by 301% over the past nine years, while inflation during the same period has increased by just 59%.\n\nThis is just one of the examples of how Transnet has made its own financial affairs look good while it strangles the economy with higher tariffs, said Sch\u00fcssler.\n\nHe said that Transnet\u2019s pipelines had increased income by more than 9% in the financial year ending in March, while its rail freight division, which is considerably larger than its other divisions, saw a decline in its income and volume.\n\nIn the 2017/18 financial year, the petrol pipeline tariff was 41.5c/litre. This increased by nearly 25% to 51.7c/litre and then to 57.5c/litre, to the present level, an increase of more than 12%, said Sch\u00fcssler.\n\nThis all happened while Transnet\u2019s principal activity, rail freight, continued to decline.\n\nCoal volumes have declined from 77 million tons to 72 million tons, and general freight from 90.8 million tons to 84.7 million tons.\n\nIron ore volumes remained relatively stable.\n\nWith the world economy slowing, and the tide of public opinion turning against coal worldwide, these volumes could decline even further. This does not bode well for Transnet.\n\nThe carrying capacity of Transnet\u2019s network is underutilised, with the Richard\u2019s Bay line capable of carrying 90 million tons.\n\nTo allow private operators on to the network for a price could be a good idea and, over the long term, it would be advisable to separate the rail network from the rail operator, said Sch\u00fcssler.\n\nThese are also suggestions that Finance Minister Tito Mboweni advocates in his economic growth plan.\n\nHowever, Transnet\u2019s acting CEO, Mohammed Mahomedy, said during the release of the results that it would be very complex to allow private operators on to the network.\n\nAt least Transnet is making a profit, but it\u2019s important that it facilitates economic growth through its tariffs, rather than feeding itself as a monopoly\n\nJoubert said that the high point of Transnet\u2019s results presentation was that it wouldn\u2019t require bailouts or state guarantees to ensure its survival.\n\n\u201cAt least Transnet is making a profit, but it\u2019s important that it facilitates economic growth through its tariffs, rather than feeding itself as a monopoly,\u201d he said.\n\nJoubert also warned against the decline in rail freight volumes, and said that large volumes of commodities should be transported by rail, rather than by road.\n\nAnother warning sign lurks in Transnet\u2019s expenses. Joubert said Transnet\u2019s workforce declined by 600 people over the financial year, but personnel costs had increased by more than R1 billion, which was concerning.\n\nAccording to Sch\u00fcssler, the average annual income of a Transnet employee is R450 000, which is relatively high.\n\nIn addition, Transnet had to record a devaluation of R1.4 billion on its books as a result of assets that had been derailed.", "description": "Transnet\u2019s 24% profit increase could be too good to be true.", "authors": ["Antoinette Slabbert"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9024/dc5e423158c248c9bd0c1bf8714456c8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
