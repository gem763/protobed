Democrats would use the federal purse to provide more grant aid and support services to students while imposing tougher regulations on colleges that produce poor outcomes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSpending more money runs counter to Republican priorities to limit taxpayers\u2019 stake in financing of higher education and the federal role in the sector. The ideological differences have made a bipartisan overhaul of the Higher Education Act elusive. The federal law, originally passed in 1965, is supposed to be renewed every five years but was last reauthorized a decade ago.\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 latest effort to reauthorize the law, through legislation dubbed the College Affordability Act, could move quickly through the chamber, albeit with revisions. Democrats have made higher education restructuring a priority.\n\nAspects of the legislation could garner bipartisan support. A number of provisions mirror elements of a bill introduced last month by Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), including proposals to overhaul the financial aid application and extend Pell Grants to prisoners. Other provisions of the House bill, including restoring Obama-era regulations aimed at for-profit colleges and giving the federal government more power over accreditation, will probably rankle Republicans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRep. Robert C. \u201cBobby\u201d Scott (D-Va.), chairman of the House Education Committee, which drafted the legislation, said lawmakers across the political spectrum should be able to support a package that is a \u201cnecessary and sensible response to the challenges that students and families are facing every day.\u201d\n\nHe said the proposal \u201cimproves the quality of education by holding schools accountable for their students\u2019 success, and it meets students\u2019 needs by expanding access to more flexible college options and stronger support \u2014 helping students graduate on time and move into the workforce.\u201d\n\nThe bill calls for expanding federal aid to low-income families by increasing Pell Grants and tying them to inflation so the value doesn\u2019t diminish. It would also create a grant program to help needy students address emergencies such as loss of housing or not having enough to eat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats are proposing creation of a partnership between the federal government and states to help them waive tuition at community colleges for residents. In exchange for federal funding, states would have to commit to sustained investment in public colleges and universities. The legislation creates a $600 million fund for states to identify gaps in academic achievement and per-student spending and prioritize aid for colleges that serve minorities, low-income students and those in need of academic help.\n\nStates that agree to cover tuition and fees before any other grants or scholarships are applied \u2014 what\u2019s known as a first-dollar program \u2014 would receive federal grants to assist with the cost. This model would allow students who receive need-based financial aid, such as Pell Grants, to stretch those dollars further and reduce the need to borrow.\n\nStudents who borrow would no longer pay loan origination fees and would have simpler options for repaying the debt. House Democrats want to whittle the suite of eight student loan repayment plans down to two: one standard 10-year plan and one income-based plan.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs it stands, people can opt to have their monthly loan payment capped to a percentage of their earnings, with the remaining balance forgiven after 20 to 25 years. The House bill would require borrowers to pay nothing until their income exceeds 250 percent of the federal poverty line, about $31,225 for an individual in 2019.\n\nWhile the 1,200-page legislative package is being lauded for its comprehensive approach, it is receiving mixed reviews from higher education experts. Some worry Democrats are missing an opportunity to push liberal goals such as lowering interest rates on student loans or capping interest that can accrue.\n\n\u201cThere is more work to be done in terms of ensuring affordability at both the front and the back end,\u201d said Ashley Harrington, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, an advocacy group.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther experts say the legislation would increase micromanagement of colleges, with requirements such as having civil rights compliance personnel on staff. \u201cThe bill is going to increase the cost of doing business for most institutions,\u201d said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president for the American Council on Education, a higher education group.\n\nHartle said the proposed legislation has merit but needs to be fleshed out.\n\nAD", "description": "Ideological differences have made an overhaul of the Higher Education Act fraught.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9KARPSGsm7LuktHpVoQXGwwSPVY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JQOLQDHCHAI6RORQU7PNATMPVQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
