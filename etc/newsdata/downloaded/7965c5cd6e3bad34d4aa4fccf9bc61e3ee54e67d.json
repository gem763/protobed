We get no credit for having a sound economic plan.\"\n\nSir John replied that he had \"the same problem\" in the UK, and \"no one sees the gains\" in the economy.\n\nLater in the meeting the president ruminated on the underlying political changes they faced.\n\n\"The central problem of our time\", he said, is that \"the whole idea of progress is being questioned\".\n\nHe added: \"The people are very susceptible to divisive policies. This is seen in the rising opposition to affirmative action, welfare and immigration.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption There were trade tensions between Europe and the US when the two leaders met in 1993\n\nIn a phone conversation in May 1995, Sir John told President Clinton that the IRA ceasefire at the time had not given him a popularity boost.\n\n\"For most people here, Ireland is just another island,\" explained the British prime minister.\n\n\"They don't really care what happens elsewhere in the world.\"\n\nThe president sympathised, tell the prime minister: \"I know how you feel\".\n\nIn July 1995, the prime minister commiserated with the president over the continuing inquiries the latter faced relating to an alleged property development scandal.\n\n\"I sympathize with you about the Whitewater stuff. I'm sorry it keeps coming up. You don't need that sort of rubbish,\" he told President Clinton.\n\nThe two compared their electoral position. Sir John told President Clinton in 1995 that Labour's big polling lead was \"ephemeral\" and he expected \"a massive return of voters\", but he needed to \"play it long\" and go the full five year period before holding an election.\n\nSir John went on to lose the 1997 general election in a Labour landslide.\n\nThe pair also discussed the stresses of leadership. In a 1996 call, the PM told the president he felt better after a holiday in France and a few days watching cricket. President Clinton replied \"I think we don't realise how mentally tired we get\", and Sir John responded \"I absolutely agree\".\n\nImage copyright Clinton Library\n\nSir John clearly tried hard to build up their personal relationship, particularly given the initial anger in the Clinton team over earlier Conservative Party support for the incumbent Republican president he ousted, George H W Bush.\n\nSoon after Bill Clinton was elected, the prime minister gave him a present which seemed to particularly please him. It was a tie in the colours of University College, Oxford, which the president had attended as a postgraduate student. On a White House memo informing President Clinton of the gift's arrival, in what appears to be his handwriting there is written \"I want the tie!\".\n\nThis correspondence also illustrates an apparent difference between US and UK policies on disclosing records.\n\nThe president's letter of thanks for the tie (\"Its colors bring back some of the happiest memories of my time spent in your country\") has been published by the Clinton Presidential Library. But in the UK's National Archives, where some material relating to the initial phase of their joint time in office has been released, this letter is omitted from the public file, instead listed as \"temporarily retained\".\n\nThe two men clearly got friendlier over time, and the relationship appears cordial and constructive. But it doesn't exhibit the relaxed bonhomie and banter of the much closer friendship between President Clinton and Sir John's successor, Tony Blair.", "description": "Newly released files shed light on the relationship between Sir John Major and Bill Clinton when they were in power.", "authors": ["Martin Rosenbaum", "Freedom Of Information Specialist"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13DE4/production/_109408318_gettyimages-590886166.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
