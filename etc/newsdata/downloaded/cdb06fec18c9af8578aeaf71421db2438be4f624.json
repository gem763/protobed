Easier central bank policy has effectively removed the last vestiges of hope for AUD & NZD, as these currencies succumb to the USD carry king.\n\n\"Absent an appreciable and sustained positive global macro impulse, these currencies will continue to languish in FX purgatory. We see clear risks that they continue to grind towards new cycle lows. While there is room for fiscal maneuvering, hedging costs and loss of yield advantage to the USD will likely continue to starve these currencies - NZD especially - of foreign capital flows.\n\n\"As a result, our expectation for these currencies to flat line over the next 6m could be too optimistic. Tactically, we see room for AUDNZD to temporarily dip before returning towards 1.10 by year-end.\"\n\nCommodities\n\nWhy taxpayers should fund Aussie rare earth miners: There is a special case for subsidising a sector, dominated by China, which produces materials essential to the defence industries, writes Matthew Stevens.\n\nCopper held steady on Wednesday before high-level talks between China and the United States but low expectations for a swift end to the prolonged trade dispute kept prices in a tight range.\n\nBenchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange ended up 0.1% at $US5684 a tonne.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrices of the metal used widely in power and construction fell to $US5518 early last month, the lowest since May 2017 on concern about demand in top consumer China.\n\nA tighter copper market can be seen in bonded copper stocks in Shanghai, which at 290,000 tonnes are down from 600,000 tonnes in March and at their lowest since late 2011, Deutsche Bank analyst Nick Snowdon said.\n\nHe added that higher copper prices on the Shanghai Futures Exchange than on the LME meant Chinese imports would stay strong through the fourth quarter.\n\n\"Short term it's a positive for prices but it's come two quarters later than was originally expected, largely due to large China trader stock liquidation in April,\" Snowdon said.\n\nAustralian sharemarket\n\nThe trade war gets real for Aussie investors: Aussie investors had hoped they could avoid becoming collateral damage in the US-China trade war. But their confidence has been shaken as Beijing struggles to fire up the Chinese economy, writes Karen Maley.\n\nAustralian shares fell sharply on Wednesday as US-China trade tensions moved up another notch and a profit warning put a dent in Flight Centre shares, offsetting a stellar performance from Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe S &P/ASX 200 index fell 0.7 per cent, or 46 points, to 6546.70 during the session.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStreet Talk\n\nBig PE players shortlisted for Archer Capital's illion\n\nCS, UBS take bids for MPC Kinetic and keep IPO hopes alive\n\nAussie fintech Verrency in Series B funding pitch", "description": "Australian shares are poised to follow Wall Street's lead and open higher, amid hints the US and China are keen to secure at least a partial trade deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/da89004a5278150eb6a9b2e9751ef3f4a19fc486", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
