Rudy\u2019s doing it? Rudy called?\u201d\n\nAs the investigation heads into its second month, this is how the facts and disinformation surrounding the possible impeachment of the 45th president of the United States are seeping into the minds of voters in New York\u2019s 11th Congressional District, a swath of the country as good a place as any to gauge how a defining moment in American democracy is playing out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is confusion about the details, especially as those details become ever more intricate. There is also an evolving sense of what is at stake \u2014 not so much among Democrats, whose reactions have changed little, moving from \u201cthat mofo needs to go\u201d in the first week to \u201cthey should nail his ass\u201d in the fourth, but among Trump supporters, whose opinions matter to Republican lawmakers who could ultimately decide the president\u2019s fate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all nonsense,\u201d one of those supporters said in the first days of the inquiry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m watching it very closely,\u201d another said last week.\n\nThe district they live in encompasses a sliver of un-gentrified Brooklyn and all of Staten Island, the \u201cforgotten borough\u201d of New York City that is home to many civil servants, police officers, firefighters and the Wu Tang Clan. It has an expressway that locals call the \u201cMason-Dixon line,\u201d which roughly divides the more diverse, more Democratic northern crescent of the borough from the whiter, more Republican rest of it. Its voters backed Donald Trump for president in 2016 and elected to Congress in 2018 a Democratic centrist named Max Rose who has called progressives \u201chipster socialists\u201d and a GOP opponent \u201ca mouth-pisser.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor any voter, there has been a lot to process in the inquiry so far \u2014 a country called Ukraine, a whistleblower, another whistleblower, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, various ambassadors, and two men named Igor and Lev. There has been real news and fake news and all of that has been pouring through a filter of mistrust evident here since the earliest days of the investigation, when Gregory Berg said he felt like he was being dragged into something he wished to avoid.\n\n\u201cLook, I care about infrastructure,\u201d he said one afternoon, ranking that as a priority far above the impeachment of a president he supports.\n\nBy then, the first crucial facts had come to light: A whistleblower alleged that President Trump had called the Ukrainian president and asked him to investigate discredited allegations about the son of Joe Biden, a potential 2020 rival. A summary of the phone call had documented this, after which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had opened the impeachment inquiry, saying the president had \u201cseriously violated the Constitution.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, on the following Sunday, people had been out at a street fair.\n\n\u201cYou put on the news and all you hear is impeachment,\u201d said Linda Sagebick, whose priority remained her medical bills. \u201cI got stitches that cost me $8,000,\u201d she said, walking with two friends past stands selling mangoes, sunglasses and \u201cTrump 2020: No More Bull----\u201d hats.\n\n\u201cWe got the problem of opioids here, and homelessness,\u201d said Mike Rehberg, a retired firefighter.\n\n\u201cThings like that are much more important to us than what Donald Trump said to Ukraine,\u201d added Brian Pritchard, a retired fire captain who did not support Trump but shared the widespread sense that whatever was about to happen would be motivated by \u201cpolitics\u201d rather than the nation\u2019s best interests.\n\nAD\n\nIt was a cynicism that transcended party lines, even as Week 2 of the impeachment inquiry began.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all corrupt,\u201d Michael Bisignano, who supports Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) in their presidential runs , said while working on his laptop at Fab Cup. \u201cThey\u2019re all addicted to power and money, and impeachment is just taking us away from what\u2019s really going on. Health care, global warming \u2014 people are really suffering in this country.\u201d\n\nBy that point in the inquiry, a second whistleblower had emerged. House Democrats had subpoenaed Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, who had acknowledged that he was working on behalf of Trump to gather damaging information about Biden, Biden\u2019s son and others. Trump had said that his call with the Ukrainian president was \u201cperfect,\u201d and a conspiracy theory was taking hold that the inquiry was only the latest \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and \u201ccoup attempt\u201d against the president.\n\nAD\n\nBehind the counter at the Bagel Bin, Joe Mastrapaolo was just trying to keep up.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019d stopped watching CNN and turned to Fox. He\u2019d stopped watching Fox and turned to the even more pro-Trump One America News Network. He\u2019d stopped watching OANN and started watching YouTube videos featuring psychics.\n\n\u201cWho do you trust anymore?\u201d he said to a customer ordering a roast beef sandwich. \u201cLike this week, I heard they changed the whistleblower law or something? Doesn\u2019t the law say a whistleblower has to have firsthand knowledge of what took place?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d said the customer, Paul Solaequi, a retired transit worker. \u201cI\u2019m so tired. Joe, I need a pound of coleslaw.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOver by a rack of potato chips, a woman named Janice, a retired civil servant who did not want to give her last name, was trying to put it all together.\n\n\u201cSo, they have this whistleblower, right?\u201d she began. \u201cAnd the whistleblower is part of the government, I dunno what agency, right? Seems like a plan to me. It doesn\u2019t seem real. It seems like they\u2019re doing whatever they have to do to take him down. It\u2019s very complicated.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe went to the counter, where sheets of notebook paper with handwritten prices of bagels, coffee and beer were taped to the Formica, and Sandra Villacampa was ringing up customers.\n\n\u201cYou know Max Rose?\u201d Villacampa said to one of them, referring to the congressman who had just held a town hall event. \u201cHe did that pro-impeachment speech and he\u2019s going to pay.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe pointed to a stack of newspapers under the counter. \u201cCongressman criticized for impeachment inquiry decision,\u201d read the headline.\n\nThat decision had also come during the second week of the inquiry, when Rose had faced 200 voters and declared, \u201cThe American people have a right to know if our president used the power of his office to get a foreign power to interfere in our election.\u201d He had spent the rest of the time fielding audience questions about senior express bus fares and $18 bridge tolls, but the inquiry was still looming over the conversations.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMaybe some of it has some validity,\u201d said Candace Crupi, a Trump supporter.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a perfect person,\u201d said her friend Michele Kunz, who also supports Trump.\n\nBy the third week, as more administration officials were coming forward to say there was more to the Ukraine matter than Trump\u2019s phone call, national polls were starting to show a slim majority of the public supporting the inquiry, including an uptick among Republican voters.\n\nAt the Bagel Bin, Joe Tompkins was not quite one of those, not yet.\n\nAD\n\nHe described himself as a \u201cgay sheet metal worker,\u201d a disillusioned Democrat turned Trump supporter. He had read the whistleblower complaint and found its professionalism \u201csuspicious\u201d rather than convincing. He had watched the Democratic leader of the impeachment inquiry, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), paraphrase the complaint during a congressional hearing, and thought Schiff was \u201ca total joke.\u201d He had seen how Trump was reacting, and thought the president was \u201ca total and complete buffoon\u201d capable of anything, and all of this had left him saying, \u201cI\u2019d be open to it if I saw that the facts were there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn the front page of the newspapers under the counter, a headline read, \u201cStone Wall vs Dems,\u201d and a story on page 7 was about a White House letter sent to House Democrats calling the impeachment inquiry \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and refusing to respond to congressional subpoenas. A customer buying a gallon of milk glanced at the cover.\n\n\u201cThe cynic in me thinks it\u2019s a witch hunt but the realist in me thinks it was quid pro quo,\u201d said the man, who gave his name only as Fallon, explaining that he worked in law enforcement.\n\nHe was a Libertarian-leaning Republican and was no fan of Schiff, saying, \u201cWhen you rush to the podium to embarrass someone, that tells me you have other motives.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, he said, \u201cI\u2019m firmly behind the rule of law, and if they have enough proof to impeach the president, they need to move forward.\u201d\n\nLater, Joe Garofolo, who owns the Bagel Bin, was behind the counter, his cellphone beeping with news alerts about the latest developments.\n\n\u201cI try not even to listen to half of it \u2014 I get aggravated,\u201d said Garofolo, a Democrat who was usually in the minority in his own store.\n\n\u201cCan I get two Advil PMs?\u201d a customer asked.\n\n\u201cHe should be impeached, but as long as the Republicans are in [control of] the Senate, they\u2019re not going to go against him,\u201d Garofolo said. \u201cEvery one of them is compromised. I think they\u2019re all corrupt, every one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d said another customer.\n\n\u201cWhatever?!\u201d Garofolo said. \u201cWell, the president is not supposed to ask foreign countries to go against his opponent, that\u2019s whatever.\u201d\n\nHe tried to stay calm.\n\nA regular named Gary came in and offered his solidarity.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s walking around like he\u2019s untouchable,\u201d he told Garofolo. \u201cThey should nail his ass. \u201d\n\nAnd now Robert Rusello was at the counter. He was a Trump supporter who was only beginning to tune in to the news about impeachment.\n\nBut now Trump was moving on to a different subject. Syria. Turkey. U.S. troops. A different phone call with a different president.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d Rusello said. \u201cIf he did something illegal with \u2014 who was it, Turkey? Or Syria?\u201d\n\nHe paused for a moment, trying to keep it all straight.\n\n\u201cUkraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing. If he did something illegal, then that\u2019s no good.\u201d\n\nNow it was the beginning of the fourth week. Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas had been arrested and charged with campaign finance violations, legal experts were saying the United States was descending into a constitutional crisis, Congress was on its way back to Washington to sort it all out, and that was what Richard Wickstrom was trying to do.\n\nHe was a retired system analyst and \u201creluctant Trump supporter\u201d who had stopped watching Fox News and turned to CNN. He\u2019d stopped watching CNN and turned to the BBC, and now he was following the news almost hour to hour.\n\n\u201cI think what he did was wrong,\u201d Wickstrom said. \u201cWas he criminal in it? I don\u2019t know. I think he went overboard. Was it a treasonous thing?\u201d\n\nHe was not sure whether the 45th president of the United States should be removed from office. But in this fourth week, he wanted to know more.", "description": "On New York\u2019s Staten Island, Trump voters are wary of the impeachment inquiry but are starting to pay attention.", "authors": ["Stephanie Mccrummen", "National Enterprise Reporter Covering An Array Of Subjects"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nzLEIlrc5COdOpImmKRsS5tUF8M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HIHRNTHO7EI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
