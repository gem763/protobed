He has been living in a fantasy land ever since, splashing thousands on jewellery, watches and cars while his new California mansion is understood to have set him back a seven-figure sum.\n\nPut simply, Ruiz has cracked it. But, like the great Marvin Hagler once said, it can be hard to get out of bed to go running at 5am when you\u2019re wearing silk pyjamas. When that famous old quote was put to Ruiz in London last week, he responded with a belly laugh.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThese are all material things,\u201d Ruiz says, gesturing to the necklace before raising his huge wrists now permanently adorned by precious metal. \u201cMaterial things that I always wanted.\n\n\u201cBut what I really want is legacy. I don\u2019t want my 15 minutes of fame or anything like that. I need to remain humble, stay disciplined and keep training. That\u2019s how I will continue to be a champion.\n\n\u201cEver since I won the world title I\u2019ve been getting so much love from my people, from a lot of different people. But I know the hunger remains there because I don\u2019t want to let my people down or my kids down. This is something new but I don\u2019t want to give it away.\u201d\n\nRuiz and Joshua last week played their part in a three-continent press tour to promote the rematch which started in Diriyah, stopped off in New York and then finished in London on Friday. \u201cIt has all been a bit of a blur,\u201d admits Ruiz.\n\nBut the 29-year-old, who has barely stopped smiling since the beginning of fightweek three months back, begins his long, punishing training camp under the watchful eye of Manny Robles this week adamant that he is still the same fighter despite the belts.\n\n\u201cTo this day I\u2019m still the nice guy,\u201d he adds. \u201cI still respect Anthony Joshua and I\u2019m a big fan of what he did in boxing. He has been a champion since his 16th fight or something.\n\n\u201cBut inside the ring, and I even told him this, there are no friends and no respect. There\u2019s nothing, just me and you trying to rip each other\u2019s face off.\n\n\u201cIn my eyes, when we\u2019re in the ring, I feel like he\u2019s trying to take my kids\u2019 Cheerios, my kids\u2019 Fruit Loops and that\u2019s what\u2019s giving me extra motivation, for real, honestly.\u201d\n\nBut while Ruiz\u2019s passion for the sport burns more brightly than ever, there have been questions asked of Joshua\u2019s mindset ever since he admitted during an interview with Sky Sports that he has grown disillusioned with boxing.\n\nIt has even been suggested that such feelings influenced the decision to take such a lucrative opportunity in Saudi Arabia instead of securing a home advantage for the biggest fight of his life. Ruiz does not seem to care whatsoever.\n\n\u201cIs he doing it for a massive payday? Maybe,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t know until December 7 but as long as we stay disciplined, we will get the same result as June 1.\n\n\u201cHis eyes are focused but deep inside we don\u2019t know what he\u2019s really thinking. Does he have doubts? Of course, we all have doubts. It\u2019s our choice to overcome them and to not overlook our opponents.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really know what he\u2019s thinking in his mind. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re only going to Saudi Arabia because he\u2019s getting a really good payday or what. All I know is December 7 is when we will both be prepared and it\u2019s my job to make sure he doesn\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nJoshua was also criticised for attributing Ruiz\u2019s stunning victory to a \u2018lucky punch sent from the Gods\u2019 in reference to the left hook, landed high on the head, which began his downfall in round three. The insinuation is that the first heavyweight champion of Mexican descent will not find such a shot for a second time.\n\nRuiz responded: \u201cCan I do it again? Of course. I know Joshua said I hit him with a \u2018shot from God\u2019 and I agree. It was a shot of the Gods because I\u2019ve been praying and wishing for this opportunity for a long time. I give all glory to God.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched the fight back a lot of times, man. A lot. I was pinching myself to see if this was real. I was watching it and watching it to see the mistakes I made and where I could improve. There were things I could have done a lot better, where I hesitated a bit.\n\n\u201cAnd when people say it was a punch from God, I say \u2018do you know what, it was. But God is still with me.\u2019\u201d", "description": "The diamond-encrusted \u2018AR\u2019 around his neck might be new but history\u2019s latest heavyweight champion of the world insists nothing has changed within the heart it hangs over since his seismic victory over Anthony Joshua.
