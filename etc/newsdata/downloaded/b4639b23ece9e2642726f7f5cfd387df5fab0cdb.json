Sign up here.\n\nLast week\u2019s turmoil in money markets raises questions about the appropriate level of bank reserves in the financial system, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said.\n\nIt is \u201cimportant that we examine these recent market dynamics and their implications for the liquidity needs in relation to the overall amount of reserves held at the Federal Reserve,\u201d Williams said Monday in a speech in New York.\n\nThe New York Fed chief\u2019s comments follow a week of volatility in money markets that was unprecedented in the years since the financial crisis. Short-term interest rates jumped amid the strain, pulling the U.S. central bank\u2019s benchmark rate above the target range and forcing the New York Fed to intervene with overnight cash loans for the first time in a decade to quell the surge.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to monitor and analyze developments closely,\u201d Williams said, adding that officials \u201cwill assess the implications for the appropriate level of reserves and time to resume organic growth of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet.\u201d\n\nThat remark echoed a comment Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made to reporters at a press conference on Wednesday after the central bank cut rates for the second time in two months.\n\nIn the years after the crisis, the Fed expanded its balance sheet to $4.5 trillion through bond purchases designed to drive down long-term interest rates. From October 2017 through July 2019, it partially unwound its bond portfolio, draining cash out of the banking system in the process.\n\nLast week\u2019s turmoil -- which centered on the market for repurchase agreements, or repos -- put attention on whether the Fed went too far in shrinking its securities holdings, and when the central bank would begin resuming balance-sheet expansion to keep pace with the needs of a growing economy.\n\nWilliams\u2019s predecessor, William Dudley, said during an interview Monday on Bloomberg Television that Fed officials will probably also seriously consider a new tool to contain short-term interest rates.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll increase the size of their balance sheet. So, they\u2019ll start to buy Treasury securities again,\u201d Dudley said. \u201cAnd the second thing that they are going to strongly consider, I think, is introducing a standing repo facility, so whenever there is upward pressure on short-term rates, there is a facility that people can come to and do repo with, and that would sort of take away any risk of a big upswing.\u201d\n\n(Updates with comments from former N.Y.
