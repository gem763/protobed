As birth rates decline globally, young people are becoming an increasingly rare sight in rural areas \u2013 and those who are born in small enclaves often leave for professional and cultural opportunities elsewhere.\n\nThe exodus of young people means that villages are left without a next generation to whom they can pass along traditions, including trades.\n\nOf course, ageing populations aren\u2019t the only reason some trades and traditions are disappearing. New technology has provided convenient replacements for some, while restrictive government regulations have impeded others. Some older trades, conversely, have been rejuvenated by social media interest.\n\nUltimately, though, family businesses can\u2019t survive in remote outposts when potential successors either don\u2019t want to take over \u2013 or, in some cases, don\u2019t exist at all.", "description": "Traditional trades have flourished in small villages for years.
