But before their reunion, Meghan spoke to British media about just how dearly she missed her husband during their separation.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex got visibly flustered talking about Harry in footage that came out of her discussion with a press reporter. \"Being able to be in Africa\u2014and South Africa, it's my first time being in this country\u2014has been really powerful,\" she started. \"And Harry has continued on to other countries. We're reuniting tonight. I can't wait for him. I miss him so much.\" (Harry visited Botswana, Angola, and Malawi while Meghan remained in South Africa with their five-month-old son Archie. Meghan did solo events while there.)\n\n\u201cwe\u2019re reuniting today, which i\u2019m excited for. i\u2019ve missed him so much.\u201d \u2013meghan gushing over harry and talking about archie is so adorable pic.twitter.com/lVIPq3wHQK \u2014 meredith (@meghvnmarkle) October 1, 2019\n\n\"But I think for us, it's just been a really special trip,\" Meghan said, regaining her composure. \"Because you get to see when you're focusing on the causes that are really important to us, you can see the impact is good, and it feels meaningful.\"\n\nWhen asked how the two were coping with having a four-month-old, Meghan laughed and said, \"five months now,\" then added, \"oh my goodness, well, we're doing well. I think the schedule\u2014they've been very kind to me, because everything is based around Archie\u2019s feed times. So it\u2019s a full plate, but we\u2019re making it work. It\u2019s worth it. So, thank you!\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Meghan and Harry spent the last couple days apart on their royal tour.", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xC1Br0XKsHW9FETBNYN9zg--~B/aD0xMDQ3O3c9MjA4OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/664826a3aacdea91aa81466f4152a8ce"}
