Scott was left heart-broken when the young man chose Cleo, and then proceeded to ask her to move in with him.\n\nIn the coming episodes, this love triangle seemingly persists, as Mitchell asks Cleo to move in once more so that he can prove how much he loves her.\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nNot too pleased with the way things are playing out, Scott later confronts Mitchell and berates him for not being truthful about what transpired to Cleo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMitchell\u2019s angry at Scott\u2019s words, and thus calls him deluded, before going one step further and telling him that he regrets ever kissing him.\n\nAs a result, Scott is left heartbroken once more and proceeds to get drunk. Later, he drunkenly posts a note under Cleo\u2019s door \u2014 a note which claims that Mitchell is a liar.\n\nOn Scott\u2019s actions, actor Imran Adams said: \u2018Cleo finds it and she wants to know who sent it and what\u2019s going on.

Before they were in this situation, they were becoming very close friends and that then led to something else but the love that they have for each other is making them make decisions that they wouldn\u2019t normally make and are quite out of character for them.\u2019\n\nWill Cleo discover the truth?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, will Scott come to regret his actions once he\u2019s sobered up?\n\nEither way, Mitchell\u2019s going to have some explaining to do!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Will Cleo discover the truth as a result of Scott's actions?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HO-EP-5274-ANITA-AND-MITCHELL-02-097d_1570116141.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
