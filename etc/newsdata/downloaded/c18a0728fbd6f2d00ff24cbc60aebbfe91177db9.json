The last weekend in September sees the Fuente de las Batallas fountain in the city centre transformed. Stalls run by local farmers are piled high with seasonal fruit. Quinces emit a subtle fragrance across the square. Vendors sell local pomegranates, jujube berries and acerolas. Local chestnuts are roasted on street corners. Torta de la Virgen pastries are also a delicious tradition at this festival. Only available that week, they are baked by local nuns and filled with sweet pumpkin. In the festival\u2019s religious activities, locals line up to place bunches of flowers on the facade of the church, covering it entirely. An incense-swathed procession through the city streets closes the celebrations.\n\nMolly Sears-Piccavey, Piccavey.com\n\nMarket restaurant, N\u00eemes, France\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest La Pie qui Couette serves dishes of food from the surrounding market stalls\n\nUntil a few years ago, a stroll through Les Halles de N\u00eemes could be very frustrating. Viewing the spectacular produce on sale \u2013 including sweet C\u00e9vennes onions and iridescent pink rougets \u2013 made one yearn for a place to sample it all. This is why chef Emmanuel Leblay\u2019s 25-seat counter restaurant, La Pie qui Couette, has been a hit since it opened in late 2015. Leblay changes his menu daily according to what he finds while shopping at the surrounding stalls. Certain dishes, however, have become classics, including a hand-chopped steak tartare and a luscious brandade de morue, a N\u00eemes speciality, here made with salt cod, Camargue potatoes, olive oil and organic lemon zest. He also pours an excellent selection of local wines, and after finishing with some fresh apricot soup or chocolate mousse, you\u2019ll understand why this place is called the Jabbering Magpie; these birds can get noisy after they\u2019ve eaten and drunk well.\n\n\u2022 Mains from \u20ac14-35, 5 rue des Halles, on Facebook, 11.30am-3pm, Tues- Sun, no reservations\n\nAlexander Lobrano, author of Hungry for Paris and France\n\nFull-on feast, Georgia\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lobio (spiced beans) is a Baia speciality. Photograph: Tommo J Williams\n\nAt Baia\u2019s vineyard, outside Kutaisi, Georgia\u2019s third largest city, rustic tables look out on thousands of vines backed by rolling hills. The supra (Georgian feast) begins as a stream of homemade dishes are set in front of you. The food is accompanied by natural wine, created by Baia herself, a third-generation winemaker who started her own vineyard in 2015, aged 22, using 8,000-year-old techniques. You\u2019ll salivate at the khachapuri (cheese-stuffed bread), roasted village chicken with tkemali (sour plum sauce), lobio (spiced beans), and peppers stuffed with bazhe, Georgia\u2019s famous walnut paste, as you fill yourself to bursting point. Certainly an unforgettable experience.\n\n\u2022 Book Baia\u2019s meal and wine tasting (from \u00a311) on Facebook\n\nMegsy Williams, Food Fun Travel\n\nFood festival, Miranda do Douro, Portugal\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pauliteiros folk dance at the Sabores Mirandeses Festival. Photograph: Joao Almeida/Alamy\n\nIn remote north-east Portugal, the small historic town of Miranda do Douro has beautiful views of the Douro river across to Spain and rocky mountain cliffs. It\u2019s home of the second language of Portugal, mirand\u00e9s \u2013 and is famous for mirandesa beef, the churra breed of sheep and b\u00edsaro pork. All these take centre stage at Sabores Mirandeses Festival in February which highlights regional specialities, from local meats and traditional smoked sausages, to olive oil, almonds and bola doce (a multi-layered cake). It\u2019s a chance to learn about culinary traditions as well as the town\u2019s culture, with Pauliteiros folk dance displays among entertainment.\n\n\u2022 14-16 February 2020, free admission, cm-mdouro.pt\n\nC\u00e9lia Pedroso, head of Culinary Backstreets Lisbon and co-author of Eat Portugal\n\nThe perfect sandwich, Porto, Portugal\n\nTasca de Badalhoca is just a sandwich shop in Porto. Yet stepping through its heavy doors into the dimness within, felt like entering another world: a Porto of yesteryear (it\u2019s been open for 120 years). Nothing flashy, no nonsense \u2013 just great honest food costing practically nothing. It was 11.30am and everyone held glass mugs of bubbly pink espadal wine. Legs of dry-cured pork hung from the ceiling, the fast-talking staff were busy, the queue moving \u2013 and I couldn\u2019t decipher the taped-up menu. I managed to order three sandwiches: presunto (ham), eggs and presunto, and leit\u00e3o (roast suckling pig), plus a mug of wine. All of it perfection. I walked out giddy on something more than ros\u00e9 \u2013 I felt I\u2019d been immersed into something dear to Porto\u2019s heart, if only for a few minutes.\n\n\u2022 Rua Dr Alberto Macedo 437, on Facebook\n\nLaura Siciliano-Rosen, Eat Your World\n\nOyster safari, Denmark\n\nDenmark may be famous for open sandwiches, but foodies know it\u2019s really all about the oysters. The Scandinavian country has two types of the marine delicacy. Head to northern Jutland for the slow-growing, native Limfjord oyster, which is celebrated for its texture and taste. (The area is a protected sea zone with stringent regulations applying to all fishing.) Or pack a bottle of bubbly and head to the Wadden Sea at Unesco-listed Vadehavscentret, south of Esbjerg, for a Pacific oyster buffet. Oyster safari tours in Denmark run from October to April (weather and tides willing).\n\n\u2022 Oyster safaris range from \u00a325 to \u00a335pp. Book a Wadden Sea tour at vadehavscentret.dk and Limfjord \u00d8sterssafari at enjoy-limfjorden.com or skaldyrcenter.dk\n\nJaughna Nielsen-Bobbit, To What Place\n\nIce-cream fantasyland, Girona, Spain\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rocambolesc serves flavours such as baked apple tart. Photograph: Age Fotostock/Alamy\n\nPlayfully decorated with candy cane poles and a wall filled with colourful, round ice-cream pints, Rocambolesc is an ice-cream lover\u2019s version of Willy Wonka. Crowds have flocked to this Girona gelateria since Jodi Rocca i Fontan\u00e9, winner of Restaurant magazine\u2019s inaugural \u201cworld\u2019s best pastry chef\u201d award, opened it in 2012. Chefs concoct gastronomic ice-cream flavours such as baked apple tart and exotic sorbets like pineapple coconut. And there are dozens of tasty toppings to choose from including sugar pearls, dried fruit, caramel syrup and candy floss. Don\u2019t skip the specially \u201cpressed\u201d brioche sandwiches \u2013 warm outside and magically cool inside.\n\n\u2022 Prices range from \u20ac3-5 for a cone or cup, depending on the number of toppings.

Photograph: George Munday/Alamy\n\nMy home county of Waterford is very much under the radar, although I expect not for much longer, since it just won Irish food destination of the year. We have wonderful producers \u2013 particularly for oysters, gin, beer and cheese \u2013 and a local soft, white, floury bread roll called blaa, that can be traced back to the arrival of the Huguenots in the 1690s.\n\nThere\u2019s a majestic coastline and the gorgeous West Waterford Festival of Food, held in Dungarven every spring (17-19 April 2020). You can go on seafood foraging walks (the Sea Gardener is running a walk on 12 October); visit the Dungarvan Brewing Company, where beers are bottle-conditioned (eliminating the need to add further gas) and named after local landmarks; the Blackwater craft gin distillery); and devour local oysters at The Tannery in Dungarvan \u2013 chef-patron Paul Flynn cooked at two-Michelin star Chez Nico in London before moving home. The Tannery also has a cooking school (courses from \u20ac75) and rooms in the Townhouse. Grow HQ in Waterford City is the national headquarters of GIY Ireland, a grow-it-yourself movement, and has a terrific cafe. And you can burn it all off on the 44km Greenway, a cycle path on a disused railway that hugs the coast all the way from Dungarvan to Waterford City.\n\nNiamh Shields, Eat Like a Girl\n\nArctic crabbing, Isles of Scilly and Norway\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Near Kirkenes, crabs are caught beneath the ice covering the fjord. Photograph: Luis Davilla/Getty Images\n\nI\u2019m a seafood lover, so the Crab Shack, at Hell Bay hotel on Bryher in the Isles of Scilly, always sticks in my mind. The setting is rustic \u2013 a converted cowshed with zero pretension and lots of cataplanas (wok-shaped Portuguese pans) brimming with shellfish (from \u00a320, depending on the size of crab).\n\nIn Norway, take things up a notch with a king crab safari from the town of Kirkenes, 250 miles north of the Arctic Circle. A snowmobile takes visitors out on the frozen fjord to pull traps from holes drilled in the ice, and later you feast on the freshest crab at a farmhouse restaurant. If you\u2019re lucky, you might even see the northern lights.\n\n\u2022 \u00a3145 per adult, snowhotelkirkenes.com\n\nMichelle Minnar, Greedy Gourmet\n\nCooking classes, Agriturismo Alle Camelie, Tuscany, Italy\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Agriturismo Alle Camelie is a superb base for foraging trips.\n\nAt Agriturismo Alle Camelie, forage for citrussy leaves of calamint, punchy stems of cicoria, starflower, sow thistle and braschetta or cavolo nero (Italian kale), deep in the folds of Pisan mountains. Spring brings banks of camellias to these naturally terraced plots, lending the agriturismo its name; autumn\u2019s olive harvest, led by resident farmer, Claudio Orsi, means hands-on fun for foodies. A seasonal highlight, zuppa alla frantiana, is based around made from red Lucca beans, cavolo nero and bread. Traditionally served to olive mill workers, it has been made regionally here \u201cas long as beans and olives have been farmed\u201d says chef Elena Pardini, whose winning variant topped the first Disfida della Zuppa slow food soup tournament.\n\n\u2022 Cooking classes on request, minimum two people, four hours from \u20ac65 including dinner, allecamelie.it\n\nSarah Barrell, editor and writer\n\nLooking for a holiday with a difference?
