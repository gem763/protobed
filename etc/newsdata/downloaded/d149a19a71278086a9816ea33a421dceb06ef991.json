I thought it was funny. What it proves is they had no point. They had no evidence of anything. When it boils down to just name-calling people, and you don\u2019t show any proof and you refuse to talk to them\u2026they refused to even come in. There were no Klansman or Neo-Nazis in there or alt-right people.\u201d\n\nAntifa was welcomed to the afterparty, but they were party poopers.\n\n\ud83d\ude41\n\nDaryl expounded:\n\n\u201cThey [Antifa] want to shut down any dialogue with racists, people who have differing views of their own. Their thing is, you know, just beat it out of them or make it impossible for them to meet. \u2026 \u201cA lot of these groups \u2013 let\u2019s take Black Lives Matter, let\u2019s take Antifa, let\u2019s take the Ku Klux Klan \u2013 none of these groups today are centralized. They\u2019re all autonomous \u2026 It\u2019s the same thing with Antifa. \u201cHalf of them may believe (in) what they\u2019re doing\u2026they may believe that they\u2019re doing some good. But I truly believe that the other half of them are simply into anarchy \u2026 They\u2019re anti-racist, so they\u2019re gonna go beat up people who are racist \u2013 but this is the exact same thing the racists do. They\u2019re not behaving any differently.\u201d\n\nOn Facebook, the black Caucasian who hates himself and others (not) like him noted that he\u2019d been called lots of names before, but \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d takes the cake.\n\nAnd in case you\u2019re wondering why the \u201c#MINDS New Jersey: Ending Racism, Violence and Authoritarianism\u201d event was held at a center in Pennsylvania: It was originally planned for a theater in New Jersey.\n\nBut Anti-fascism threatened to burn it down.\n\nWay to go, everybody.\n\nStellar work.\n\n-ALEX\n\nSee 3 more pieces from me:\n\nCandace Owens Relives Last Year\u2019s Chicken And Waffles Antifa Antagonism And Pegs The Group Perfectly (Video)\n\nCruz & Cassidy Introduce A Resolution Labeling Antifa A Terrorist Organization, But Here\u2019s Why It\u2019s Ridiculous\n\nEx-Democrat Dave Rubin\u2019s Spreading The Word: If You\u2019re A Liberal, Don\u2019t Get It Twisted \u2013 The Mob Is Coming For You (Video)\n\nFind all my RedState work here.\n\nAnd please follow Alex Parker on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThank you for reading!
