Their latest offering: this surprisingly chic Scandinavian-style sofa, coming to their Special Buys section next week for a measly $249.\n\nThe two-seat sofa comes in a standard grey polyester, or a way more exciting (and realistic-looking) tan faux leather, and features a fun double-cushion design that demands some cozy Netflix cuddles. It\u2019s also a \u201ccompact design\u201d that\u2019s \u201cperfect for small spaces\u201d, which as far as I\u2019m concerned means one thing and one thing only: bedroom sofa. The height of luxury!!!\n\n(Plus it comes with a one-year warranty \u2013 always reassuring when you\u2019re paying a pittance for a piece of high-traffic furniture.)\n\nThe tan beauty is part of ALDI\u2019s \u201cMid Century Living\u201d range, which also features a series of hotel lobby-style rugs, a collection of wood and black metal furniture (including a pair of nesting side tables for just $29.99), and some fun storage baskets that your houseplants would look great in.\n\nAlso on the special buys list for next week: a bunch of Indian cooking stuff, including a roti maker and a samosa maker, neither of which I knew existing and both of which I must have immediately.\n\nALDI\u2019s special buys \u2013 housed in the hallowed middle aisle, that jumble of dreams and wonders \u2013 are legendary for their deep discounts and occasional deep weirdness.
