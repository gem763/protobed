I was finishing on the fourth of July so I didn\u2019t think anyone was going to be around. So they caught me the night before and I was totally off guard.\n\n\u2018Everyone was gathered, there was this gorgeous cake that was Michonne with the sword and everything\u2026 Norman [Reedus] and, of course, Darrell Pritchett, the amazing man in charge of our special effects, they had this massive, really gorgeous, overwhelming fireworks display.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe big question now is how Michonne\u2019s exit will pan out on the show, and whether she could potentially return for the planned Rick Grimes movies.\n\nDanai Gurira at New York Comic Con (Picture: Ilya S.
