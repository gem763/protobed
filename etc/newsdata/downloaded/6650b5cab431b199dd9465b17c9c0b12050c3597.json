Never has British politics seen a better embodiment of the malevolent and nihilistic clown of DC Comics fame ahead of his much-hyped solo film, to the cost of all of us.\n\nThose despairing at the appalling misrule of the country courtesy of him, his henchman/puppet master Dominic Cummings and their cabal could be forgiven for wondering where Batman is when we need him.\n\nMaybe he's emerged. Step forward Philip Hammond.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOn the face of it, there could scarcely be a less likely candidate for taking on the mantle of the caped crusader than the former chancellor of the exchequer.\n\nHammond earned the nickname \u201cSpreadsheet Phil\u201d while occupying No 11 and seemed to positively revel in it. He embodied a certain grey competence, which is not an insult by the way. Britain could arguably do with a little more of it given the state it has been driven to.\n\nBut there was nothing grey about his Today Programme interview this morning, during which there were shades of the Dark Knight\u2019s icy fury.\n\nThe leading Tory rebel rained blow after blow down upon his foe, or rather, his foes. And they hit home.\n\nUsing his bat-scalpel, he excoriated the Johnson Joker government for having no negotiation strategy or even a negotiating team. The clear implication was that the leaks suggesting that Cummings views the \u201ctalks\u201d as \u201ca sham\u201d are correct and that the government is actively pursuing no deal. In which case the joke will be on the entire country.\n\nHe also lambasted the firing of his former aide Sonia Khan, who was escorted out of Downing Street by a gun-toting plod on the orders of \u201cDon\u201d Cummings.\n\nAnd he warned that should the Johnson-Joker attempt to follow through with his threat to bar him from standing as a Conservative, a Sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of all the rebels who back the latest cross-party attempt to frustrate a no-deal Brexit, he\u2019ll be in for the fight of his life at the next election.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty\n\n\u2018\u2018This is my party. I\u2019ve been a member for 45 years. I will defend my party against entryists who would turn this party into a narrow faction,\u201d Hammond said. About time too.\n\nThis was no idle threat. Listen to the tone.\n\nHammond is a Tory, or at least he\u2019s what we used to know and understand as a Tory in the days before the entryists he spoke of grabbed hold of the party in an attempt to tip the country over the edge.\n\nHe believes in the things that Tories are supposed to believe in: Low taxes but also sound public finances, British institutions, the rule of law, the nation state and the Union. Upon his appointment as foreign secretary by David Cameron, he was, in fact, considered something of a Eurosceptic (as was Dominic Grieve, by the way).\n\nHe hasn\u2019t changed much. It is the party that has, ever since Cameron made perhaps the worst decision in British political history in calling the EU referendum.\n\nDoing the rounds yesterday were but 20 or so names of the more or less declared members of the Rebel Alliance, (pop cultural references abound at the moment) out of more than 300 Tory MPs.\n\nThat speaks to the degeneration of their party into an extreme nationalist sect propped up by cynical careerists (I see you Matt Hancock, Nicky Morgan, Amber Rudd).\n\nThe ranks of those who can still claim to be serving as Conservatives are declining at a rapid pace. Just before Hammond spoke, his former government colleague Justine Greening became the latest moderate to announce her intention to stand down at the next election.\n\nDoes Hammond\u2019s fight stand much of a chance? Even the Batman, with all his experience of fighting against odds, might baulk.\n\nTo avert the imminent crisis and save the country from the Joker\u2019s wrath, it will only require sufficient rebels\u2026 sorry\u2026 it will only require sufficient Conservatives to stand alongside him. There may be just enough.\n\nSaving his party will be a lot harder.\n\nBut don\u2019t underestimate Britain\u2019s Batman. Or should that be BatHam?", "description": "Boris Johnson is the Joker.
