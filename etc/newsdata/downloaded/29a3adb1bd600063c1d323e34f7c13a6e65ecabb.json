We have to do something,\" said the minister in French at a media conference, echoing repeated calls by western Quebec MNAs Mathieu Lacombe and Mathieu L\u00e9vesque to implement safety measures.\n\nThe Quebec government hopes its pilot project will show the barriers are an innovative, cost-effective solution that could work on other collision-prone roadways.\n\nEngineer \u00c9rick Abraham says the Quebec government's plan will be largely unhelpful since the cables will stretch into the oncoming lane when there's a collision. (Jonathan Dupaul/Radio-Canada)\n\nWrong solution, say experts\n\nThere are concerns, however, that Quebec is introducing the barriers on a highway that doesn't have enough space between opposing lanes, going against minimum safety standards established across North America.\n\nEngineer \u00c9rick Abraham, a road safety specialist at Montreal's \u00c9cole Polytechnique, said the cables won't reduce the risk of a head-on collision.\n\nNowhere else in Canada and the U.S., said Abraham, are the barriers used to divide opposite directions of a single-lane highway that has no median, grass or otherwise.\n\n\"This barrier was not designed for where it will be installed,\" said Abraham in a French interview with Radio-Canada.\n\nAbraham pointed to a report from Alberta's Ministry of Transportation that examined the use of HTCBs in a province that boasts the longest stretches of the barriers in North America.\n\nThat report notes that when a vehicle strikes the cable, it acts like an elastic band, absorbing the vehicle's energy and preventing it from crossing into the oncoming lane.\n\nBut the cable needs some room: too little, and the cable stretches into oncoming traffic, taking the vehicle with it.\n\nHow HTCBs work \u2014 and how they could go wrong\n\nWhen there's enough space\n\nWhen there's not enough space\n\n'Not our practice': Alberta\n\nThe 20-page report notes HTCBs are unsuitable for medians less than six metres wide.\n\n\"When it is struck, the cable barrier can deflect two metres or more,\" said Peter Mah, an engineer with the ministry. \"So that's why it's important to have that allowance for safety for vehicles in the opposite direction.\"\n\nWhile Alberta has seen a dramatic decrease in injuries and deaths with the installation of HTCBs, Mah said his province wouldn't allow what Quebec is considering.\n\n\"When it comes to installing on a centre line of an undivided highway, that's not our practice,\" he said.\n\nThere's less than one metre of space between the lanes of Highway 50 between Gatineau and L'Ange Gardien, Que. Experts say the cable barriers need significantly more than that to be useful. (Radio-Canada)\n\nNo federal guidelines, motorcycle concerns\n\nThe five manufacturers that supply HTCBs in the U.S. and Canada report that vehicles that strike the cables continue to travel forward anywhere from two to 3.7 metres before their momentum comes to a halt.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration recently warned that range \"is the minimum deflection distance\" and can actually be greater, depending on how and where the cables are installed.\n\nCanada's federal government offers no such guidelines, with each province setting its own standards, according to an email from Transport Canada.\n\nThe U.S. warning also raises concerns about motorcyclist safety when barriers are built with little room between lanes.\n\nA motorcyclist that hits that will literally become mincemeat. - Michel Audy\n\n\"The proximity of the barrier to traffic also results in an increase in the number of impacts, but motorcyclists are much more vulnerable and have more reported crashes,\" it says.\n\nMembers of the Outaouais Motorcyclists' Association want Quebec to reconsider the barriers.\n\n\"Any extremity, arms, legs, can get caught up in that at high speeds,\" said Michel Audy, who deals with safety issues for the association.\n\n\"A motorcyclist that hits that will literally become mincemeat. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nMichel Audy of the Outaouais Motorcyclists' Association says HTCBs are particularly dangerous for motorcycle riders.\n\nBarriers to be installed quickly\n\nRosalie Faubert, spokesperson for Quebec's transport ministry, said there are few other options, as the stretch of Highway 50 lacks enough room or adequate visibility to install concrete blocks between the two lanes.\n\nFaubert said the province will try to carve extra space for the cable barriers out of the highway's shoulders.\n\nShe said they're eager to install them quickly, given public safety concerns. The ministry plans to have the HTCBs installed along the five-kilometre route by next spring, before the work on twinning that section begins in spring 2021.", "description": "A pilot project that would install\u00a0high-tension cable barriers on a stretch of Highway\u00a050 east of Gatineau isn't in line with North American safety rules and may not prevent\u00a0head-on collisions, according to transportation experts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5300607.1569612552!/fileImage/httpImage/image._gen/derivatives/16x9_620/quebec-autoroute-50.", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
