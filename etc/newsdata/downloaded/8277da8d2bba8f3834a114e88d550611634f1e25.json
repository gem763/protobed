Doha has responded by enacting a broad reform program in which it has scrapped exit permits for most workers, established a minimum wage and launched dispute committees to hear worker grievances.\n\n\u201cThere has been some small improvement but generally we\u2019ve found there\u2019s been a real lack of progress and workers are paying the price,\u201d said Amnesty International\u2019s Deputy Director of Global Issues, Stephen Cockburn.\n\nIn a report last week Amnesty documented the cases of about 2,000 workers unable to recover unpaid wages, despite the dispute committees and a fund established to pay them back, with many forced to return home unpaid.\n\n\u201cWe do believe that the bodies like FIFA sponsors and others and national football associations all have a role in highlighting these issues, in speaking out and to try and encourage and pressure the Qatar authorities to do what it said it would do,\u201d Cockburn said.\n\nQatar said in a statement responding to Amnesty\u2019s report that it was working to make sure its reforms are \u201cfar-reaching and effective\u201d and that \u201cany issues or delays with our systems will be addressed comprehensively\u201d.", "description": "World Cup 2022 host Qatar has made improvements in labor rights for its two million foreign workers, but reforms have not lived up to promises made, Amnesty International told Reuters in an interview.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
