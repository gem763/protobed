He suggested that public opinion should be taken into consideration, even for senators who preferred to vote their conscience, since it was the choice of the electorate that lawmakers presumed to override.\n\n\u201cThis. Is. Their. President,\u201d he thundered at an event in November 1998 as President Bill Clinton\u2019s fortunes rested with Congress, summarizing the view of Democratic voters whom Mr. Biden said he had met. \u201cDon\u2019t screw with him unless you have an overwhelming case that you can make that you\u2019re being fair about it.\u201d\n\nAnd in an early signal of Mr. Biden\u2019s deference to formal protocol, his experiences in the 1970s and 1990s seemed to crystallize the abiding faith in institutions \u2014 deep respect for the Senate, a reverence for process \u2014 that remains his hallmark, even as his current competitors suggest he is out of step with the crackling tribalism of the Trump era .\n\n\u201cHe stuck with kind of an institutional approach to things, which he did for his whole career,\u201d said Ted Kaufman, a longtime friend and aide who worked for Mr. Biden during Watergate and later succeeded him briefly as senator. \u201cLet the system work.\u201d\n\nFor a young lawmaker straining to find his way amid personal tragedy, the Nixon fracas was an early test of Mr. Biden\u2019s defer-to-convention instincts and a jarring introduction to the capital. After his election in 1972, Mr. Biden had spoken to Mr. Nixon in an uncomfortable, minute-long courtesy phone call from the president after Mr. Biden\u2019s wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash that December. (\u201cI understand you were on the Hill at the time, and your wife was just driving by herself,\u201d Mr. Nixon said, stammering for a few beats, according to a recording. \u201cThe main part is, you can remember that she was there when you won a great victory.\u201d)", "description": "Until Wednesday, he had resisted calling for President Trump\u2019s impeachment.
