He took leave when the investigation started and then resigned.\n\nIn Khosa\u2019s suspension letter he was told to answer to charges of gross misconduct that include making allegations against SANParks and certain officials, challenging authority and being disrespectful.\n\n\u201cThe investigation will look into your apparent behaviour that is damaging to the image of SANParks and/or mission of SANParks, bringing SANParks\u2019 name into disrepute, non-adherence to the grievance policy and procedure and matters related thereto,\u201d said the suspension letter, signed by chief ranger Nicholus Funda.\n\nBlack employees have told City Press about being assaulted, maimed and charged on baseless allegations of rhino poaching.\n\nKhosa\u2019s union, the National Union of Public Service and Allied Workers, has dismissed SANParks\u2019 allegations against Khosa as being \u201cvague\u201d.\n\nKhosa declined to comment for fear of facing more charges.\n\n\u201cOur office is facing difficulties in responding to your allegations in that your letter, specifically paragraph one, which was meant to address the allegations levelled against our member, are vague.\u201d\n\nThe union\u2019s case management officer, Siphiwe Ngalo, asked SANParks to provide further particulars about the allegations Khosa made against SANParks, as well as the officials he had mentioned.\n\nIt asked what authority he had challenged and what alleged disrepute he had brought to SANParks.\n\nSANParks spokesperson, Isaac Phaahla, said Khosa\u2019s suspension would not be discussed in the public domain.\n\nPhaahla confirmed that SANParks had received the final report into the investigation but declined to share its findings and recommendations.\n\nREAD: Investigation into staff complaints of racism, torture at Kruger Park\n\n\u201cWe are not able share the details as we have repeatedly implored your publication to respect the process as it is highly regulated and complex. This was an internal investigation and affected stakeholders are being engaged,\u201d he said.\n\nRegarding Phillips\u2019 resignation, Phaahla repeated that it was a \u201cpersonal choice\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe was not implicated in any way by the outcomes of the investigation. More than 80% of the allegations levelled against Kruger management were not substantiated,\u201d he said.\n\nSANParks, said Phaahla, was building social cohesion among its staff through various internal programmes as part of nation building, but that did not mean there was racism in the organisation.\n\nAlthough Phaahla downplayed the allegations of racism, incidents reported in the Kruger National Park suggest otherwise, City Press has been told.\n\n\n\n", "description": "SA National Parks (SANParks) has suspended a whistle-blower whose claims about racism and the arbitrary torture of black rangers on suspicions of rhino poaching in the Kruger National Park precipitated an investigation.", "authors": ["Sizwe Sama Yende"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7938/327ae856b4ef407faff7c663f8e01f00.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
