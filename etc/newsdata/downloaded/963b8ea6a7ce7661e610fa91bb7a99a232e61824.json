Bernie Sanders and his wife Jane arrive at a campaign event in California in July. (Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who is in Las Vegas recovering from a procedure to treat a blocked artery, is expected to return home to Vermont by Sunday and plans to participate in the upcoming Democratic debate, according to his wife, Jane Sanders.\n\n\u201cHis doctors are pleased with his progress, and there has been no need for any additional procedures,\u201d Jane Sanders said in a written statement released by the campaign on Thursday. \u201cWe expect Bernie will be discharged and on a plane back to Burlington before the end of the weekend.\u201d\n\nShe said Sanders would \u201ctake a few days to rest, but he\u2019s ready to get back out there and is looking forward to the October debate.\u201d\n\nThe next debate will be held on Oct. 15 near Columbus, Ohio. CNN and the New York Times will host the debate, which will air in prime time and is expected to draw millions of viewers.\n\nThursday\u2019s announcement was the most concrete indicator of the Vermont senator\u2019s timeline for returning to the campaign after doctors found the blockage and inserted two stents earlier this week.\n\nIt remained unclear whether Sanders, 78, would resume his normal campaign activities before the debate. Jeff Weaver, a senior Sanders adviser, said Wednesday that Sanders had canceled appearances \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d\n\nThe overall state of Sanders\u2019s health was also unclear. A spokesman declined to provide more specifics about his condition beyond the statement from Jane Sanders.\n\nBut the campaign signaled Thursday that it intended to keep pressing ahead in the early nominating states. A TV ad campaign in Iowa the Sanders team had abruptly put off will begin on Tuesday, a campaign spokesman said. It is backed by $1.3 million and is slated to run for two weeks.\n\nSanders was hospitalized during a trip to Nevada after experiencing chest pains at a Tuesday campaign event, according to Weaver. He was still recovering in a hospital on Thursday, the campaign said.\n\nJane Sanders flew to Las Vegas to be with him on Wednesday, according to the campaign.\n\nAn artery blockage such as Sanders\u2019s normally has a good prognosis and does not tend to require a long recovery period, medical experts said.\n\nThe senator thanked those who have wished him a speedy recovery, taking the opportunity Wednesday to highlight Medicare-for-all, his proposal for universal health care. \u201cNone of us know when a medical emergency might affect us. And no one should fear going bankrupt if it occurs. Medicare for All!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nSanders has been campaigning at an aggressive pace in recent weeks, often holding multiple events per day, sometimes in more than one state.\n\nSanders generally appears robust and energetic, but he has dealt with minor health issues over the past few months, such as losing his voice during a trip to Denver and injuring his head on the edge of a shower door in March, opening a wound that required seven stitches.\n\nSanders has vowed to release his health records before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses, the first contest of the primary season. Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), two other candidates in their 70s, have made the same promise.\n\nPolls show Biden, Warren and Sanders are the three leading candidates for the Democratic nomination, and a younger generation of White House hopefuls has struggled to keep pace with them.\n\nSanders received encouragement and well wishes from near and far as he recovered in Las Vegas. Harry M. Reid, the Nevada Democrat and former Senate majority leader who served in the upper chamber of Congress with Sanders, paid him a visit, according to the Sanders campaign.\n\nSanders\u2019s Democratic rivals have wished Sanders a speedy recovery, and at least one campaign has sought to help his team deal with the difficult moment. Warren\u2019s campaign sent dinner to Sanders campaign staffers working at his D.C. headquarters on Wednesday, prompting a public thanks from a Sanders aide.\n\n\u201cbig thank you to @Team\u00adWarren for sending dinner to our dc headquarters. the team is very grateful (and started with the cookies first),\u201d tweeted Sanders spokesman Mike Casca.\n\nChelsea Janes in Las Vegas contributed to this report.", "description": "The Vermont senator will return home by Sunday after having two stents inserted, and he plans to appear at the Oct. 15 Democratic debate.", "authors": ["Sean Sullivan", "Reporter Covering National Politics", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TM_U5XNT4t7j1DlUTqJvPwwp9_A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7LCS26XGCYI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg"}
