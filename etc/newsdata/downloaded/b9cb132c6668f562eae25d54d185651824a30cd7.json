Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nOsaka, who brought 15-year-old American Coco Gauff\u2019s New York run to an end in the third round, will kick off the day session inside Arthur Ashe Stadium when she faces Swiss 13th seed Belinda Bencic.\n\nThe Japanese 21-year-old has had an up-and-down year since her Australian Open win and she has her hands full against a rested Bencic, who enjoyed a walkover into the last 16.\n\nBencic will bring plenty of confidence given she beat Osaka in their two meetings this year to improve to 2-1 in their head-to-head record.\n\n\u201cI mean, for me playing her is always super challenging,\u201d said Osaka, who beat Bencic in 2013 but lost to her this year at Indian Wells and Madrid.\n\n\u201cI just expect a fight. She doesn\u2019t really ever give up. She kind of fights for every point.\u201d\n\nNadal, who retired injured from last year\u2019s New York semi-final with knee trouble, kicks off the evening session inside Ashe and will be rested and raring to go against the 2014 champion Cilic after smooth passage to the last 16.\n\nThe 18-times Grand Slam champion has not dropped a set and had a walkover in the second round when Australian Thanasi Kokkinakis withdrew with injury.\n\nBut the Spaniard knows he faces a tough test against the big-serving Croat.\n\n\u201cI need to be focused with my serve, as always. I need to be ready to accept the challenge that brings the competition in days like these ones,\u201d said Nadal. \u201cAnd I hope to be ready to play my highest level, because that\u2019s what I am going to need.\u201d\n\nIn other action, German sixth seed Alexander Zverev will face Argentine Diego Schwartzman while Russian Andrey Rublev, who upended Nick Kyrgios in the third round, meets Italian Matteo Berrettini.\n\nCanadian teenager Bianca Andreescu will close out proceedings under the Arthur Ashe lights when she battles American qualifier Taylor Townsend, who has found success with a throwback game of aggressive net play.", "description": "Defending champion Naomi Osaka will seek a spot in the U.S. Open quarter-finals when she returns to the court on Monday while second seed Rafa Nadal faces former winner Marin Cilic in last 16 action.", "authors": ["Frank Pingue", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425261438&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8108T"}
