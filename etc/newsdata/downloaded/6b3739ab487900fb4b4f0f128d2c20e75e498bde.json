He said he\u2019d left the other bodies in his apartment in Roseville, Calif., more than 200 miles away.\n\nMount Shasta police contacted authorities in Roseville who confirmed at a press conference on Monday night that three bodies had indeed been found in the man\u2019s apartment. The identities of the victims and their relationship to the suspect have not been made public.\n\nSgt. Robert Gibson of the Mount Shasta Police Department told The New York Times that the suspect had been very calm and \u201cmatter of fact\u201d when he spoke to them. He was so composed that officers initially didn\u2019t believe he was telling the truth, Gibson said \u2015 until he handed over the keys to the car he said he\u2019d driven to the station with the body inside.\n\n\u201cHe just came in and told our dispatcher that I want to confess to a murder, and then just gave it up,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cI have never had someone come in with a body and turn themselves in here. This was unusual for us.\u201d\n\nMount Shasta and Roseville police said they are conducting a joint investigation into the killings. The suspect has been detained but has yet to be formally charged, the Times said.\n\nRoseville police are investigating a quadruple homicide. Three victims were found in an apt in Roseville and the other body was found in a vehicle in Mt. Shasta. Police found out after a man turned himself in today. @ABC10 pic.twitter.com/xA5TyjkGTh \u2014 Ananda Rochita (@AnandaRochita) October 15, 2019", "description": "The suspect told California's Mount Shasta Police Department on Monday that he'd killed four of his relatives, including the dead person in the car.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da58bee210000510facdda0.png?cache=ciarswnuds&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
