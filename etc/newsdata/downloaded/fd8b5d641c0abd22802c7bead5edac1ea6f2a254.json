UPDATE 6-Oil steadies amid fall in U.S. inventories, weak economic data\n\n* U.S. crude stocks fell 5.9 mln bbls last week - API\n\n* Weak U.S. manufacturing data weigh on global shares\n\n* Iran predicts slight supply surplus next year\n\n\n\n(Updates prices, adds Putin's comments)\n\nBy Bozorgmehr Sharafedin\n\nLONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Oil steadied on Wednesday,\n\nfollowing several days of declines, after industry data showed\n\na surprise drop in U.S. crude inventories, although gains were\n\ncapped as weak economic readings in the United States depressed\n\nglobal markets.\n\nBrent crude futures , an international benchmark for\n\noil prices, were up 20 cents to $59.09 a barrel at 1153 GMT.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 40\n\ncents to $54.02 a barrel.\n\nFront-month WTI prices settled down for a sixth straight\n\nsession on Tuesday, their longest losing streak this year, after\n\nU.S. manufacturing activity dropped to a 10-year low as\n\nU.S.-China trade tensions weighed on exports. But prices found some support from American Petroleum\n\nInstitute (API) data which showed U.S. crude stocks fell last\n\nweek by 5.9 million barrels, against expectations for an\n\nincrease of 1.6 million barrels. API/S\n\n\"It seems to be a fight between two opposing forces; On the\n\nbullish side another draw in U.S. inventories, on the bearish\n\nside concerns on weaker economic data, and currently ebbing\n\ntensions in the oil market,\" said Giovanni Staunovo, an oil\n\nanalyst at UBS.\n\n\"I still hold a constructive outlook short term,\" he added.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration's (EIA) weekly oil\n\ninventories report is due at 1030 EDT (1430 GMT). EIA/S\n\n\"Even if the EIA were to confirm the API crude oil number\n\nthis afternoon, the momentum off a single number can easily fade\n\nas the economy is front and centre for global markets right\n\nnow,\" said Harry Tchilinguirian, global oil strategist at BNP\n\nParibas.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would continue\n\nto be a responsible player in the alliance between OPEC and\n\nnon-OPEC oil-producing nations, known as OPEC+.\n\nSpeaking at an energy forum in Moscow attended by the Saudi\n\nand Iranian energy ministers, Putin said it was important to use\n\nall available tools to balance the energy markets. Iran's Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said he expected a slight\n\nsurplus on the oil supply side next year. United Arab Emirates Minister of Energy and Industry Suhail\n\nal-Mazrouei said OPEC and its allies were monitoring global oil\n\nmarkets, and that conformity levels were the same as previously\n\nannounced at the last OPEC+ joint ministerial monitoring\n\ncommittee meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, Ecuador, one of the smallest members of the\n\nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said it would\n\nleave the 14-nation bloc from Jan. 1 due to fiscal problems.\n\nEcuador will be the second country to withdraw from OPEC in the\n\nlast year after the departure of Qatar.\n\n\n\nU.S. manufacturing https://tmsnrt.rs/2pcL2gs\n\nOPEC Production png https://tmsnrt.rs/2nl7GCI\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 6-Oil steadies amid fall in U.S. inventories, weak economic data", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA5T0AF_L.jpg"}
