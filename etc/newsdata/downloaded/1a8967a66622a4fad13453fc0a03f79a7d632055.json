Which is why we did a double-take when we saw these Levi\u2019s on sale at Shopbop, since they seem like the Goldilocksian ideal of our favorite jeans. They have an 11-inch rise with a button fly. The straight legs flare out just ever-so-slightly at the hem, which hits right above the ankle. The blue wash looks broken in but not sloppy. And though the style name \u2014 Ribcage \u2014 makes them sound intimidatingly rigid, they\u2019re also made with stretch denim, which means they should be comfortable to wear all day, too. To sweeten the deal even more, these Levi\u2019s are 20 percent off at check-out, part of Shopbop\u2019s Event of the Season, with the code STOCKUP19.\n\nLevi's Ribcage Straight Ankle Jeans $78 (was $98, now 20% off) $78 at Shopbop Buy with code: STOCKUP19\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
