Users can share pictures and videos in the app, and share automatic status updates with them based on a user's movements throughout the day.\n\nInstagram says that feature shares small pieces of context with friends but will not give away their exact location, can only be seen by selected contacts and is opt-in.\n\nInstagram has previously been accused of aggressively targeting Snapchat and its popularity with teenage smartphone users \u2013 a demographic with which Snapchat remains one of the most commonly used social media platforms.\n\nThe new app will begin to roll out globally this week for both iOS and Android.\n\nThe automatic status updates can be chosen from a list of pre-made options \u2013 for example 'studying' or 'on the move', or can be created and personalized by the user to express what they are currently doing -- similar to how the nostalgic AIM messenger status worked.\n\nThe standalone app is a companion to the main Instagram service, the firm said, and is based on the Close Friends feature of Instagram \u2013 a select list of contacts users can edit and then share content directly with.\n\nInstagram's Threads app (pictured) has rolled out to the masses and is being criticized for looking very similar to Snapchat.\n\nThe Facebook-owned company confirmed Threads users will only be able to message those contacts on their Close Friends list.\n\nThe rest of an account's messaging content will continue to appear in the Instagram Direct section of the main Instagram app, the platform confirmed.\n\nFacebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has previously said that private messaging is a key part of the company's future.\n\nHowever, the company has faced repeated suggestions it has targeted Snapchat when introducing new features.\n\nThe social networking giant and its wider family of apps \u2013 which also includes WhatsApp \u2013 introduced Stories, the chronological collection of pictures and videos which appear on user's profile for 24 hours, after Snapchat had achieved success with the format.", "description": "Instagram is testing a 'Group Stories' feature, after it was dropped by Facebook last month for lack of engagement.
