The Discover feed, Google said in its launch announcement, \u201cmakes exploring your interests easier than ever.\u201d BuzzFeed News spoke to eight people who saw articles in their feeds that refute climate science. Each of the people it spoke to either works in an environmental field or is interested in climate change.\n\nThe content that users reported seeing had titles like \u201cBipartisan Panel of Scientists Confirms Humans are NOT Responsible for Past 20,000 Years of Global Warming.\u201d In reality, mountains of evidence have led to a scientific consensus that points to humans as the culprit behind climate change.\n\nMountains of evidence have led to scientific consensus that points to humans as the culprit behind climate change\n\nGoogle\u2019s search tool and feed are supposed to help users find information that will be most \u201cuseful.\u201d The company reassures users that it works with external search quality raters to assess \u201chow well a website gives people who click on it what they are looking for, and evaluate the quality of results based on the expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness of the content.\u201d Its search page is one of the most trafficked websites in the world.\n\nSeeing inaccurate or deceptive content on climate change on a trusted platform like Google can be eyebrow-raising at best and misinforming at worst. H. Curtis Spalding, an environmental professor at Brown University who had previously worked as a regional administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency, told BuzzFeed News that when he saw a blog denying climate change on Discover, \u201cat first, I was confused by them.\u201d Spalding clicked on one that he thought might be credible. After that, he said, similar content appeared on his feed.\n\nWhat's worth noting on our Google Discover story is that this is separate from search. Google's service determined users were interested in a topic like global warming and then proactively sent them links to climate change denier sites https://t.co/dyW0ImLjcq \u2014 Ryan Mac (@RMac18) September 5, 2019\n\nPushing climate-denying content to users isn\u2019t exactly the image Google wants to project. It has several initiatives to combat climate change in the works. Last year, it started an initiative that estimates the carbon footprint of individual cities, and in 2017, it committed to purchasing as much renewable energy as it uses. By the following year, it had exceeded that goal. The company prides itself on \u201cmaking decisions that have an impact beyond our walls,\u201d it said in a June blog post. However, Google also came under fire earlier this year for financially supporting a conference that featured a talk focused on denying climate change.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Verge.", "description": "Google\u2019s Discover feed has promoted climate change-denying content to readers, according to a report published by BuzzFeed News on September 5th.", "authors": ["Justine Calma", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgQPa968-qvHamQ5HmpQ7A0ttOc=/0x302:4256x2530/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19174033/1040640412.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
