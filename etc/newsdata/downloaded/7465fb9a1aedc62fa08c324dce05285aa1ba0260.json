At the time, she said, an abusive mother told her she could keep her first-born Tiffany or baby Kristin, according to Berajano\u2019s husband, Eric Gardere.\n\nUpon Kristin\u2019s birth, Berajano\u2019s mother told her that the baby had died 15 minutes after she had given birth. She never even saw the child, according to Gardere. Berajano and Gardere, whom she met months after Kristin\u2019s birth, have celebrated the birthday of the child they believed to be dead every single year since.\n\n\u201cIt was a hard time every year,\u201d said Gardere, according to Fox 26. \u201cShe would go into major depression.\u201d\n\nLOS ANGELES TO STUDY $30 HOURLY MINIMUM WAGE FOR UBER, LYFT DRIVERS\n\nLast year, Berajano\u2019s first child, Tiffany, convinced her mother to take a DNA test. Soon after, she received an email. \"I think we need to talk, it says we're related, and it says you're my mom.\"\n\nInstead of the daughter she\u2019d given birth to, Berajano found out now she has a son. \u201cI don't care. I don't care if he's in transition. I don't care if he hasn't transitioned. I don't care. That's my kid,\" said Berajano. \u201cWe\u2019re just glad he\u2019s alive,\u201d added Gardere.\n\nVIDEO SHOWS UTAH TROOPER RISK HIS LIFE TO SAVE DRIVER STUCK ON TRAIN TRACKS\n\nKristin was adopted by a loving family five days after birth and grew up in Las Vegas, never knowing how much his biological mom thought about him. He now lives in New Jersey with his wife and new baby.\n\n\"Looking at him just makes me want to cry,\" said Bejarano.\n\nThough Gardere is not Kristin\u2019s biological father (he fathered three other children with Berajano), he said he considers Kristin his son. \u201cWe've been communicating with Kristen for a few months now. He calls me Dad, I call him Son, I text him every morning.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKristin, his wife and their baby are all visiting Bejarano and Gardere in Los Banos, Calif. on Nov. 24.", "description": "After taking a DNA test, a California woman learned her child, who she\u2019d been told had died as an infant, was actually alive and well-- and now thirty years old.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Tina-Bejarano.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
