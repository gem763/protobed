According to a report issued this year, anti-Semitic incidents around the world rose 13 percent in 2018.\n\nIn October 2018, an armed gunman opened fire inside Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life synagogue, killing 11 people and wounding many more. The massacre became the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\n\nAD\n\nAt the time, police said the motive of the alleged shooter, Robert Bowers, was \u201cto kill Jews.\u201d\n\nWhile synagogues in Germany are usually protected by police, worshipers and officials around the world are increasingly forced to weigh tighter security measures. In the United States, the Pittsburgh massacre prompted many to debate the idea of ramping up security measures in and around holy buildings.\n\nAD\n\nThose in support of the measures think tighter security would make people feel safer, while others fear the protective steps could make a place of worship less welcoming.\n\nWhile speaking to reporters after the attack, President Trump was asked whether the shooting would prompt the United States to revisit its gun laws. \u201cThis has little to do with it. If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better,\u201d he said, suggesting that armed guards could help prevent atrocities.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s remarks, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto hit back, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think that the answer to this problem is solved by having our synagogues, mosques and churches filled with armed guards.\u201d\n\nJust six months after the Tree of Life shooting, a 19-year-old white man killed one person and wounded three more when he opened fire at a California synagogue. The shooting, which took place on the last day of the Jewish holiday of Passover, sent shock waves through the local community.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn May, a man threw molotov cocktails at a Chicago synagogue in an effort to set it on fire, police said. After the attempted arson attack and other reports of vandalism at synagogues in the surrounding area, the Chicago Police Department was forced to ramp up security outside Jewish schools, businesses and synagogues.\n\nAccording to a report released this year, the most serious anti-Semitic incidents of 2018 took place in the United States and the United Kingdom, followed by France, Germany and Canada.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a record number of anti-Semitic incidents were recorded in the first six months of 2019 by Jewish charity Community Security Trust. The report, which was shared in August, said that 892 incidents had been recorded \u2014 a 10 percent increase from the 810 incidents recorded during the first six months of 2018.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn July, a far-right extremist set fire to a synagogue \u2014 and himself \u2014 after pouring fuel through a synagogue\u2019s windows in Devon, a seaside county in England. The attack coincided with a Jewish feast day that is used to commemorate the Holocaust.\n\nDuring his arrest, the suspect allegedly said: \u201cPlease tell me that synagogue is burning to the ground. If not, it\u2019s poor preparation,\u201d the BBC reported at the time.\n\nAD", "description": "Once considered places of refuge, synagogues around the world are often targeted.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hassan", "Social Media Editor For The Foreign Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KqqEcVHEMvSXppRsvPB0DoETs50=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VMBVOJHKUUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
