(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nFor the first time, the National Prescription Drug Take Back Day on Oct. 26 \u2014 a semi-annual initiative by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) that encourages people to anonymously and safely dispose of expired and unused medications \u2014 will accept vapes and cartridges.\n\nIn a statement, the DEA cites \u201cconcerns\u201d that have been raised across the U.S. over \u201cillnesses and death caused by vaping and the high youth vaping initiation rates.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the total number of lung injury cases linked to e-cigarettes or vaping products has now reached 1,604, extending to every state except Alaska, and has led to 34 deaths.\n\n\u201cIn an effort to support a healthy lifestyle and energetic population, especially amongst America\u2019s youth, DEA is committed to doing all it can to help safely dispose of vaping devices and substances,\u201d the agency said in the statement.\n\nExperts say the DEA\u2019s decision to include vaping devices this year is a good step. Mark Calarco, the national medical director for clinical diagnostics at American Addiction Centers, tells Yahoo Lifestyle: \u201cWhile we will have to wait to see if this new initiative is actually effective, it does send a powerful message that vaping is not inherently safe and people may need to take action to protect their health. In light of the recent deaths and health consequences linked to vaping, this is a step in the right direction because it continues to raise the alarm about the potential dangers.\u201d\n\nKevin Wolowiec, retail pharmacy manager at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Yahoo Lifestyle: \u201cI am supportive of any effort to remove addictive or harmful substances from our community.\u201d\n\nAlong with vaping devices and cartridges, the National Prescription Drug Take Back Day is also the time to dispose of any old prescription drugs taking up room in your medicine cabinet.\n\nThe free service, which launched in 2010, is part of an effort to stop drug abuse. The DEA noted that having unused prescription medications at home means they\u2019re \u201cvulnerable to misuse, theft or abuse by family members and visitors, including children and teens. That's dangerous and often tragic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen old or unused prescriptions are not properly discarded, there is the potential for misuse or even theft,\u201d explains Calarco. \u201cIn fact, when analyzing prescription misuse in the United States, we find the majority of people surveyed indicate they got their drugs from a friend or relative. A recent study from River Oaks Treatment Center found this to be the case for 52.8 percent of respondents, compared to 36.4 percent who were prescribed a pain reliever. About 4 percent of the time this happens without the knowledge of the friend or relative.\u201d\n\nCalarco continues: \u201cWith prescription and illicit opioids accounting for 68 percent of overdose deaths, it\u2019s important we do all we can to keep these medications off the streets and out of the wrong hands. National Prescription Drug Take Back Day is a day set aside to make it convenient for the public to safely discard of these medications with hundreds of drop off locations across the country.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s about preventing the misuse of the medications and saving lives.\u201d\n\nWolowiec says the program can also help patients who are taking daily medications, but may \u201cexperience medication discontinuations and dosage changes.\n\n\u201cKeeping old prescriptions may lead to confusion about therapies and a patient inadvertently taking a medication that was discontinued or the wrong dose of a medication,\u201d he says.\n\nIf you have vaping devices or prescription medications you\u2019d like to safely dispose of on National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, you can either search for the nearest collection center by using your zip code or city and state on the DEA\u2019s site or by calling 800-882-9539. There are more than 6,000 collection sites across the U.S., which will be open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time on Oct. 26.\n\nHowever, before dropping off any e-cigarettes or vaping devices, you have to first remove the battery (the collection centers can\u2019t take lithium-ion batteries). If you\u2019re having trouble removing the battery, the DEA suggests consulting \u201cwith stores that recycle lithium-ion batteries.\u201d Or you can dispose of it through local e-waste recycling programs or events. You can find local programs by searching by state here.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "For the first time, the National Prescription Drug Take Back Day on Oct. 26, where people can anonymously dispose of unused or expired drugs, will accept vaping devices and cartridges.", "authors": ["Rachel Grumman Bender", "Beauty", "Style Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vfmswMFuSGkt4rP_TlkqNg--~B/aD0yMDYzO3c9Mzg0MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/dacca6c0-f745-11e9-93ae-6d4cb73f35e9", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
