Dealt with two early high kicks comfortably, made a fine tackle on Carreras in the corner and took his try well. 8/10\n\n14 Anthony Watson Not necessarily his fault but did not see the ball nearly as often as he would have liked. On the rare occasion he was given space he looked bright. 6/10\n\n13 Manu Tuilagi Fortunate to escape further sanction for taking Boffelli a moment early in the air and one poor knock-on. All in all not at his most conspicuous. 5/10\n\nEngland dismiss feisty Argentina after Tom\u00e1s Lavanini sees red Read more\n\n12 Owen Farrell (capt) Again the recipient of a high tackle that led to a red card and four consecutive missed kicks is practically unheard of. Gathered himself after the interval. 6/10\n\n11 Jonny May Could not really fail to score his first try of the tournament and showed how well rounded his game is now. Once or twice ran backwards, though. 7/10\n\n10 George Ford Argentina\u2019s big runners sought him out at every occasion so he will have enjoyed bursting through two defenders for his try. Another superb performance. Man of the match. 8/10\n\n9 Ben Youngs Still not quite happening for him \u2013 perhaps he\u2019s trying to force things too much \u2013 but he took his try well on his 92nd appearance and remains a key senior figure. 6/10\n\n1 Joe Marler Among England\u2019s most fearsome tacklers. Gave away one silly penalty but he does not want to lose his place to Mako Vunipola and he is doing all he can to keep it. 7/10\n\n2 Jamie George There is an argument to say he is fast becoming the player England could least live without. Solid rather than spectacular here but he is so reliable. 7/10\n\n3 Kyle Sinckler Conceded an early penalty but made up for it by winning one at key scrum. The kind of player it must be a nightmare to play against when down to 14. 7/10\n\n4 Maro Itoje Imposed himself on opponents as the match wore on. Only his fifth international appearance all year and he is evidently hungry for four more. 7/10\n\n5 George Kruis England\u2019s lineout was not flawless but it is easy to see why Eddie Jones turns to him for the harder matches. A quiet time in the loose, though. 6/10\n\n6 Tom Curry Natural tendency is to involve himself as much as possible but as he grows into blindside role he is learning to pick and choose his moments. 7/10\n\n7 Sam Underhill Two thunderous hits early in the second half typified his effort as England turned the screw. He ended as England\u2019s top tackler and with tank emptied. 8/10\n\n8 Billy Vunipola Half-time departure with left foot heavily strapped is a concern. Apart from one powerful run he was not having his best game and coughed up two turnovers. 6/10\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Elliot Daly scores for England against Argentina.
