The claims include racketeering, invasion of privacy and fraud.\n\nMcGowan alleges that when Weinstein learned in 2016 that she planned to write about the alleged rape said to have taken place in 1997, he unleashed a team of fixers to ensure her story \u201cnever saw the light of day, and \u2013 if it did \u2013 that no one would believe her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWeinstein\u2019s campaign against McGowan and others involved some of the most powerful forces that money could buy,\u201d according to the suit.\n\n\u201cHe enlisted prominent, media-savvy representatives David Boies and Lisa Bloom. He hired the international spy agency, Black Cube.\u201d\n\nThe suit says Weinstein and his team worked in concert for more than a year to try to silence his victims and journalists reporting on the abuses.\n\nBloom\u2019s attorney Eric George said in a statement to AFP on Wednesday that \u201cit is inexcusable that Ms McGowan chose to include my client in her lawsuit.\u201d \u201cFacts matter,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThere is simply no credible factual or legal basis for her claims against my client. We look forward to our day in court to set the record straight.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for Weinstein and the other defendants in the suit could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nMcGowan says in her lawsuit that at the time of the alleged rape, she was a budding star with lead roles in two Weinstein-produced films and that she finally ended up agreeing to a settlement as she sought to move on with her career.\n\nYears later, however, she says began working on a memoir \u2013 published last year \u2013 that included details about the alleged abuse and how Weinstein\u2019s conduct toward her and others \u201cpoisoned the film and television industry.\u201d\n\nApart from McGowan, Weinstein has been accused of sexually assaulting dozens of other women during his decades in the entertainment industry.\n\nIn 2018, he was arrested in New York on charges of rape and sexual abuse and is awaiting trial.\n\nHe has denied allegations of non-consensual sex.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "US actress Rose McGowan filed a lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein, alleging he conspired to discredit her when she accused the disgraced movie mogul of rape.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harvey-Weinstein-Rose-McGowan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
