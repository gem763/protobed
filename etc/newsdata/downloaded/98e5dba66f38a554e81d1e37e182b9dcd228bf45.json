It is not only yesterday and today. He is feeling the supporters don\u2019t like him.\n\n\u201cHis commitment with the club is a great commitment every time. He wants to help.\n\n\u201cHis behaviour was perfect in training, with the group and with the club. He knows he was wrong.\n\n\u201cHe was wrong and he feels it inside very deeply. But that is normal as a human.\u201d\n\nEmery admitted he felt Xhaka \u2013 who joined from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2016 \u2013 should have said sorry to supporters but insists he is not interested in receiving an apology of his own.\n\n\u201cI spoke to him this morning about him only, his personal moment,\u201d added the Spaniard.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need his apology. Because I know he is devastated, we can speak about all the situation but first it\u2019s him.\n\n\u201cHe is now very down and we need to support him. I don\u2019t need his apology to me now.\u201d\n\nEmery revealed he had spoken to Josh Kroenke immediately after the game, with the club director making a rare visit to the Emirates Stadium, and that they had agreed between them that Xhaka was in the wrong \u2013 but he wants to see the player win back the trust and faith of supporters.\n\n\u201cMy ideal future is to watch again Xhaka playing and every supporter supporting him,\u201d he said.\u201dThis is my ideal. I don\u2019t know if I can or will achieve it but this is my ideal. Also for him it\u2019s the same but also I think we need now to be calm step by step so we can progress.\n\n\u201cBut my idea is to achieve a big connection collectively and individually with the supporters.\n\n\u201cWe can maybe remind some similar situations in the past for players, and they came back.\n\n\u201cFor example, I was speaking with Hector Bellerin and he said to me that he received some criticism three years ago at Emirates Stadium in one moment because people weren\u2019t happy with his performance and then he came back.\n\n\u201cThe most important is to keep moving ahead, working, improving and showing and transmitting to people that if one moment they don\u2019t like him, to work to change that situation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know not today how it will be in the future, the most important for me is the present.\u201d\n\nThe present for Xhaka is being left at home for Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup fourth-round clash at Liverpool, although Emery was adamant that decision had been made before Sunday\u2019s flashpoint.", "description": "Arsenal will offer counselling and other supportive measures to Granit Xhaka as talks continue over whether he should be stripped of the club captaincy for swearing at his own fans.
