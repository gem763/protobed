Credit LITs have their place, but most retail investors are unfamiliar with alternative lending and different debt risks. Also, the LIT structure adds complexity because the LIT can trade at a discount to NTA.\n\nAndrew Lockhart, Metrics Credit Partners managing partner, says investors are recognising the benefits of investing in listed credit products for income, rather than shares. \u201cInvestors should buy equities for long-term capital growth and debt for income,\u201d says Lockhart.\n\nAndrew Lockhart believes non-banking lending has solid long-term prospects. Jeremy Piper\n\n\u201cYet retail investors in Australia typically buy blue-chip shares for yield. They may not realise how much company-risk and equity-market risk they are taking on, or that better risk-adjusted returns are available from a well-managed, diversified portfolio of credit.\u201d\n\nLockhart believes non-banking lending has solid long-term prospects. \u201cMore companies are struggling to raise debt as major banks reduce lending in some areas as a result of regulatory changes that are impacting the banks,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is creating an opportunity for alternative lenders. At the same time, investors are searching for yield in a low-rate environment. Interest and fee income from corporate loans is a way to provide reliable monthly income. Credit LITs give investors exposure to a less liquid asset class via the ASX that has traditionally only been available to institutions in Australia.\u201d\n\nMartin Scott, Partners Group Australia managing director, says the ability of credit funds to conduct due diligence on companies they lend to is a strength. \u201cPrivate debt issued to a company might not be rated like a corporate bond, but the difference is we will have done months of due diligence before choosing to lend to a company, will have access to its management and the boards, monitor that loan closely during its life, and have structures in place to minimise risk. Lenders have a lot more say in the company\u2019s strategy compared to investors in a corporate bond or share if something goes wrong,\u201d he says.\n\nScott says the Partners Group Global Income Fund invests in the debt of around 150 global companies, most of them well known and with strong balance sheets. \u201cThe fund is very diversified across countries and sectors and we avoid highly cyclical industries. No single loan is worth more than 1.5 per cent of the fund, so a loan default, which has been rare in Partners Group funds worldwide, would have a limited impact.\u201d\n\nCredit LITs add to rising retail interest in debt products, off a low base. Fund flows into fixed-interest exchange traded funds (ETFs) soared 78 per cent to $9.5 billion at the end of September, ASX data shows, and the volume of these ETFs is proliferating. Slowly and surely, Australia is building a much-needed culture in fixed-interest investing.\n\nWhere they sit\n\nCredit LITs sit at the intersection of debt and alternative assets. Non-bank lending to companies or private-equity syndicates is included within the alternative asset universe. Giant pension funds and some local superannuation funds are increasing their exposure to alternative assets, such as private capital, to enhance returns and portfolio diversification.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrent targeted returns of credit LITs range from 4 to 10 per cent, depending on the type of debt issued. That is higher than the yield on cash and government bonds, comparable with fully-franked yield from bank stocks, telcos and utilities (for some credit LITs), and better than the average yield on bank hybrids, which have become popular among income investors.\n\nQualitas co-founder and group managing director, Andrew Schwartz, says the Qualitas Real Estate Income Fund\u2019s targeted 8 per cent net annual return appeals in an economy with interest rates approaching zero. \u201cIt\u2019s an attractive return relative to the risk taken. People invest in property or a real estate investment trust (REIT) for a similar or lower yield, yet in doing so take on that equity risk. The smart money is getting yield from the debt side of property,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Qualitas LIT provides exposure to commercial and residential property loans secured by first and second mortgages, mostly in Australia. Debt sits in a more secure part of the real estate capital structure than equity because debt investors get preferential treatment for income distribution and capital return \u2013 appealing for conservative investors.\n\n\u201cEssentially, investors in a property loan have someone else\u2019s equity supporting that loan,\u201d says Schwarz. \u201cIf a property company goes into liquidation, secured credit, which is the majority of the Qualitas portfolio, gets paid first. The flipside is investors in property debt can only earn the income from the loan and get their capital back. They do not benefit if the value of equity in the property rises. Conservative investors may be happy with that risk/return trade-off.\u201d\n\nKey benefits\n\nThe potential risk-adjusted return of credit LITs is their main selling point. An income investor who buys Commonwealth Bank for an expected franked dividend yield of around 7 per cent might instead buy MCP Income Opportunities for its targeted 7 per cent cash yield (and 8-10 per cent targeted total return). CBA\u2019s total return could be much higher than the MCP LIT if the CBA share price rises, boosting capital growth. But an investment in CBA provides exposure to one company: the MCP LIT provides private-credit exposure to more than 100 companies.\n\nDiversification is the other key benefit of credit LITs. Alternative assets have a lower correlation (relationship) with equity markets: when sharemarkets rise or fall, the value of a portfolio of corporate loans is less affected. The price of credit LITs on the ASX probably would fall in a sharemarket correction, but less so than LICs/LITs that invest in shares.\n\nWhat to watch\n\nIn spite of these benefits, prospective investors in credit LICs need to apply caution.\n\nThe starting point with any fund is assessing the manager and its record. On that score, the current batch of credit LITs come with mostly well-known Australian and international managers. But that could change as newer firms are attracted to non-bank lending and credit LITs.\n\nTargeted returns are another issue. They are a goal rather than a promise. The MCP Master Income Trust has bettered its targeted return of the RBA cash rate (currently 75 basis points) plus 3.25 per cent annually, since inception. The Qualitas LIT had an annualised return of 7.2 per cent in the year to September, below its 8 per cent target. Investors should assess the average return from credit LITs over longer periods and understand if and why it has fallen below target. Qualitas\u2019 performance gap is partly because it decided to have more first-lien loans (the most secure form of private debt) to reduce portfolio risk.\n\nBe aware of the composition of targeted returns. The Partners Group Global Income Fund, for example, targets a net annual distribution of the RBA cash rate plus 4 per cent. The LIT can invest 60-100 per cent of its portfolio in secured first-lien loans, 0-20 per cent in second-lien loans including mezzanine debt (a riskier form of private debt) and up to 25 per cent in special situations, such as distressed debt.\n\nMezzanine debt and special-situation debt should pay a higher return than the cash rate plus 4 per cent, given the risk. There is nothing wrong with the Partners Group LIT targeting debt that provides higher return as situations arise. The Switzerland-based firm has an excellent record in private debt and equity overseas and in Australia. Prospective investors just need to understand that a low headline targeted return is not always commensurate with lower-risk secured debt.\n\nCynics might argue that a lower target return helps credit LIT managers achieve their performance fees by setting the bar lower. Performance fees in credit LITs are complex and can vary according to the type of debt issued. But it is worth understanding how much the manager could earn if it beats its targeted return and how much risk was taken to get there.\n\nCurrency is a further consideration. The Partners Group Global Income Fund and NB Global Corporate Income Trust invest in offshore assets, creating currency exchange risks for Australian investors. Some credit LITs have currency hedging strategies and prospective investors should understand how a falling Australian dollar could affect returns.\n\nLeverage within credit LITs is a key issue. The Qualitas LIC, for example, has no leverage, eliminating the risk that a third-party lender will call in its loan in a downturn, potentially crunching the trust\u2019s returns. Most credit LICs have debt facilities they can draw on and it is not unusual to raise debt capital to help fund loans, as banks do. The issue is how much leverage is in credit LICs and whether it is being used to lift returns, and what that does to underlying risk.\n\nThe reliability of a credit LIT\u2019s published NTA is also important. Credit LITs invest in a portfolio of loans, which by their nature are blind to investors. The manager cannot disclose loan details for confidentiality reasons, so investors rely on credit LITs to state an accurate NTA. Metrics Credit Partners, for example, uses a global accounting firm to independently determine monthly NTA. And there is a risk of conflicts of interest if an LIT invests in funds owned by its manager, paying layers of fees.\n\nPrivate credit is a highly illiquid asset. A credit LIT manager cannot easily call in a loan if unitholders want to redeem their funds in a bear market. The LIT structure, to varying degrees, suits illiquid assets because of the closed-end capital model. The LIT manager oversees a fixed pool of capital that changes with capital raisings. Investors buy and sell units in the credit LIT, not its underlying fund.\n\nThe downside is that illiquidity of an LIC/LIT\u2019s underlying asset can cause it to trade at a persistently large discount to NTA. An LIC, for example, might have assets of $1 a share yet trade at 90\u00a2 on market. In theory, credit LITs should trade near NTA unless there are non-performing loans, and that has been the NTA experience so far.\n\nAs with all LICs/LITs, investors must watch the NTA closely. Signs of rising loans in arrears or loan impairment or defaults could crush a credit LIT\u2019s NTA and drive its unit price sharply lower. But there have been no signs of non-performing loans in key credit LITs so far.\n\nNTA premiums are another matter. Most credit LITs currently trade at a small premium to NTA. Paying more for an asset than it is worth is illogical and credit LITs should not warrant large premiums over time, given their portfolio returns are mostly fixed.\n\nCaveats aside, credit LITs could become a useful tool for income investors. It is too soon to know if they will consistently achieve their target returns over long periods; choose and manage the right loans as they have more capital to deploy; how they will respond to rising competition as alternative-lending increases; what would happen if the banks fight back in parts of corporate lending; and how portfolios would perform if there was an economic or financial market shock and loan defaults spiked.\n\nThe early signs, at least, are promising as investors embrace credit LICs and more companies use non-banking lenders in a capital-constrained market.", "description": "Credit listed investment trusts are finding a large audience: income-starved investors crushed by falling returns from cash and fixed interest and worried about buying stocks in a mature bull market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5926%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_4%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9b8b7e6c1648f38e6b7dfbae75d4903d68bb0b8c", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
