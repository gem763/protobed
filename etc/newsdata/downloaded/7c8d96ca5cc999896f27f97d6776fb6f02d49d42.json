Libra will be a global payment system fully backed by a reserve of cash and highly liquid assets. Now I believe that this is something that needs to get built but I get that I\u2019m not the ideal messenger for this right now. We\u2019ve faced a lot of issues over the past few years and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of people that wish it was anyone but Facebook who were helping to propose this.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg stated that he is unsure about the success of the project stating: \u201cI actually don\u2019t know if Libra is going to work, but I think it\u2019s important to try new things as long as you\u2019re doing so responsibly. That\u2019s whats made America successful and it\u2019s why our tech industry has led the world.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg then discussed the Libra association which is comprised of 21 companies and organizations that aim to develop the Libra cryptocurrency. \u201cEven though the Libra association is independent and we don\u2019t control it,\u201d said Zuckerberg, \u201cFacebook will not be a part of launching the Libra payment system anywhere in the world even outside the U.S. until the U.S. regulators approve.\u201d\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
