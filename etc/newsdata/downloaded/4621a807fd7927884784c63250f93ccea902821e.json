Boris Johnson was thwarted last Saturday and again on Monday, first by the sinuous Tory Remainer Sir Oliver Letwin, and then by the shamelessly pro-Remain Speaker, John Bercow.\n\nAt last has Boris Johnson has won a longed-for victory, and by a surprisingly comfortable margin \u2014 only to have the prize immediately snatched from his hands by a familiar combination of a self-serving Labour front bench and irreconcilable Remainer MPs\n\nAlthough Mr Johnson threatened yesterday in the Commons to pull the bill rather than \u2018allow more months of this\u2019, last night he spoke only of \u2018pausing\u2019 it\n\nThere have been hundreds of hours of Commons deliberation, repeated EU summits, millions of words in newspapers and on TV, countless journeys to and from Brussels by officials and politicians. Brexit has driven the country and much of Europe half mad.\n\nYet at last the Prime Minister has won a longed-for victory, and by a surprisingly comfortable margin \u2014 only to have the prize immediately snatched from his hands by a familiar combination of a self-serving Labour front bench and irreconcilable Remainer MPs.\n\nJust when it seemed we might be on the road to some sort of resolution, hopes have been dashed by members demanding more time to scrutinise the Government\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement Bill.\n\nThe consequence might well be more chaos in the short-term. Although Mr Johnson threatened yesterday in the Commons to pull the bill rather than \u2018allow more months of this\u2019, last night he spoke only of \u2018pausing\u2019 it.\n\nMillions of people will be bemused, depressed, exasperated or infuriated. In normal times, MPs would have been justified in asking for more time to look at a bill of such complexity, though there is much in it that is familiar from Mrs May\u2019s deal. But these are far from normal times.\n\nBefore we sink into despair, though, let\u2019s recognise that the PM has won a great symbolic victory, if not yet one nailed down in law. One way and another, I believe he will be able to build on yesterday\u2019s considerable achievement.\n\nMany reasonable voters, including Remainers, will acknowledge that he finally got a Brexit vote through the Commons, and did so less than three months after becoming Prime Minister.\n\nAnd this was accomplished despite many in Parliament and the media accusing him of engaging in a sham negotiation whose only purpose was to provide bogus cover for what was allegedly his real intention of finagling a No Deal.\n\nSuch scepticism was not confined to opposition parties. Many supposedly on his side doubted his ability to close a deal with Brussels. One of them was Rory Stewart, a candidate in the recent Tory leadership contest won by Boris.\n\nThis is what Mr Stewart said almost exactly a month ago: \u2018If he does get a deal through, I would not stand again. I would be the first to apologise. I would get down on bended knees in front of Boris and admit I\u2019d been wrong.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s true he acknowledged a few days ago that his pessimism had been misplaced, but he has certainly not yet gone down \u2018on bended knee\u2019. Nor has he given us any clue that he will give up his political career by not standing to be the next Mayor of London.\n\nI\u2019m not particularly gunning at Mr Stewart. The point is that, despite been surrounded by naysayers, Mr Johnson has triumphantly delivered a deal which many people had declared impossible \u2014 before being tripped up by an obdurate House of Commons.\n\nWhatever happens, as a result of events last night, it now seems inconceivable that Britain can leave the EU on October 31, as the PM has endlessly promised that we would\n\nOnly last week, after being deserted by the Democratic Unionist Party \u2014 and I fear the PM did betray them over his new customs proposals for Northern Ireland \u2014 many sages forecast that he could never win a pro-Brexit vote. Last night he did, by a whopping 30 votes.\n\nHowever maddening the subsequent vote to drag out the progress of the bill, it is surely highly likely that Boris\u2019s single-mindedness and determination will have put him on the high ground of British politics in many voters\u2019 minds.\n\nWhatever happens, as a result of events last night, it now seems inconceivable that Britain can leave the EU on October 31, as the PM has endlessly promised that we would.\n\nBut it\u2019s not implausible, though perhaps unlikely, that he could come to an agreement with opposition parties to limit the process of scrutinising the bill to two or three weeks, after which time we might be able to leave the EU if the bill were approved in anything like its existing form.\n\nNor is it beyond the realms of possibility that Brussels will only offer a short extension of a few weeks. In that case, there would be pressure on Remainer MPs (who are terrified of No Deal) to limit whatever delaying or wrecking tactics they may be self-indulgently dreaming up.\n\nIf Mr Johnson were able to deliver Brexit in, say, late November, I don\u2019t believe the electorate would accuse him of having inexcusably prolonged the agony. Fair-minded people can see he had done his utmost to fulfil his promise, only to be frustrated by scheming MPs.\n\nSo notwithstanding his warning yesterday that he would not countenance \u2018months\u2019 of delay, I can imagine him putting up with a few more weeks if there seemed a reasonable chance of \u2018getting Brexit done\u2019.\n\nBut I\u2019m not at all sure that he needs to achieve such an outcome this side of an election. In the past few days, Remainer MPs have been defining themselves in exactly the way Mr Johnson wants to present them \u2014 as incorrigible opponents of almost any version of Brexit.\n\nThe stage is now set \u2014 from the Prime Minister\u2019s point of view more favourably than ever before \u2014 for a Parliament versus the People election in which he can portray himself as the democratic defender of the 2016 referendum result, as well as a decisive and indomitable leader.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly true, of course, that due to the ill-conceived and idiotic Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, Boris can\u2019t call an election at a time of his choosing.\n\nThat said, there are various ways by which he could precipitate one. The Scots Nats might be encouraged to call a vote of No Confidence in the Government in which the Tories abstained.\n\nIf Jeremy Corbyn cowers in the shadows, producing increasingly implausible reasons for refusing to engage, he and his party will inevitably suffer\n\nOr the PM could present a short bill, which might be supported by opposition parties other than Labour, negating the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act and enabling an immediate election.\n\nEven if these or other ruses failed, is it really conceivable that Labour could continue to resist an election day after day, week after week, having so frequently and so vehemently demanded one?\n\nQuite possibly Labour might attempt to worm its way out of its existing commitment to embrace an election once No Deal is off the table. But if it did so, it would risk damaging its electoral prospects.\n\nPolitical parties exist to fight elections and win power. If Jeremy Corbyn cowers in the shadows, producing increasingly implausible reasons for refusing to engage, he and his party will inevitably suffer.\n\nAfter last night\u2019s debacle, some will say that things have gone from bad to worse. I don\u2019t believe they have. Even if it\u2019s not possible to predict every step by which Boris Johnson will deliver Brexit and vanquish Labour, I\u2019m increasingly confident that he will.", "description": "At last Boris Johnson has won a longed-for victory, and by a surprisingly comfortable margin - only to have the prize immediately snatched from his hands writes STEPHEN GLOVER.", "authors": ["Stephen Glover For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/22/20056086-0-image-a-5_1571778999790.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
