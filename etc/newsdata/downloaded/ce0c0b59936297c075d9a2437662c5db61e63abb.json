A photographer. A lighting crew, wind machine, props, and a computer .... asking you to think I woke up like this.\"\n\nShe's only been on Instagram for less than a week, and she's already killing the caption game.\n\nOf course, considering she's admitted to having had a secret \"stalker\" account before making her official Instagram, it might not be such a surprise that she's already so good at the 'gram.\n\n\"When I was thinking of doing this, I sort of figured it was time to kind of understand the world and dip my toe into the sort of social media pool,\" she said during a guest appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live last week.\n\nShe also beat a record when she joined the platform. In just five hours and 16 minutes, Aniston gained a million followers, besting the previous record holders, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who gained a million followers in five hours and 45 minutes.\n\nRELATED: Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston Just Re-Enacted Their Favorite Friends Scene\n\nCould we be any more impressed?", "description": "Jennifer Aniston made a reference to Julia Roberts in 'Notting Hill' in a pants-less Instagram photo.", "authors": ["Kimberly Truong"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XPSL5JVkPAteU7.Ijlpmew--~B/aD01MTg5O3c9MzYyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/instyle_846/2d8251b303f596b1693b9130bbfe907c", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
