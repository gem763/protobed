His muscle tone approximates a fresh tennis ball.\u201d\n\nSeven years have passed since that interview, but even a casual observer could attest that his physique remains as taut as ever \u2014 the perfect frame for his wardrobe of tight T-shirts and skinny jeans that have long been his trademark.\n\nWhile we can\u2019t account for his diet or anti-aging regimens, frequent updates about his workouts pour in from Jersey Shore spies: \u201cI just saw The Boss on the treadmill at WorkOut World in Tinton Falls,\u201d or, \u201cHe was swimming in the ocean at the Chapel Beach Club in Sea Bright all summer,\u201d they tell The Post.\n\nYou know, regular guy stuff fit for a regular guy, who just happens to be worth $500 million.\n\nMost recently, he\u2019s been sweating at Jersey Strong gym (the re-branded Workout World) in Marlboro, NJ, where he\u2019s seemingly sticking to that same old routine: treadmill and weights.\n\nHear about that boutique fitness devotees who are going into debt just to pay for pricey classes that keep them in their size two jeans? Springsteen has found the fountain of youth in a mega gym that charges $9.99 a month.\n\nBut his fit physique isn\u2019t a facade for vanity\u2019s sake. As recently as three years ago, during \u201cThe River\u201d tour, he was performing electric four-hour shows so energized, one would assume he has a special Duracell battery pack attached to his impossibly toned back.\n\nAt most concerts, the then-66-year-old would submit himself to his adoring crowds and allow them to pass him, on his back, to a platform where he\u2019d quickly stand, chug a beer, and continue belting out \u201cHungry Heart.\u201d\n\nAfter the encore, he\u2019d send thousands of fans half his age home with the fatigue of having run 10 miles uphill \u2014 and saying, \u201cI\u2019ll have what he\u2019s having.\u201d\n\nAnd he isn\u2019t using his milestone birthday as an excuse to take up less rigorous pursuits.\n\nLast December, the age-defying dynamo wrapped up a grueling 236-show run on Broadway. In June, he put out a solo album, \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d and most recently, he announced another 2020 tour with the E Street band.\n\nForget asking fitness advice from the Hollywood hunks and starlets getting in shape for superhero movies. Maybe we should be following the real superhero, otherwise known as \u201cThe Boss.\u201d\n\nA version of this report appears on NYPost.com.", "description": "He sticks to his same old routine: treadmill and weights.", "authors": ["Kirsten Fleming"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FV581_Spring_ZG_20171004002013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
