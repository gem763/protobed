The GSOMIA is about to reach its expiry and was expected to be extended for another three years, but South Korea has pulled away from the agreement in light of the trade dispute.\n\nThe agreement has traditionally acted as an important symbol of security cooperation for the US, South Korea, and Japan in the region.\n\nThe US had strongly urged South Korea to not withdraw from the agreement before the announcement.\n\nThe latest move by South Korea further increases uncertainty for the global electronics supply chain as the country is a leader in making consumer electronics and the components that go into their production.\n\nThe trade dispute has also put a cloud over other local electronics maker such as LG Display, the world's largest Liquid Crystal Display maker, and SK Hynix, the world's second largest memory chip maker.\n\nEarlier this week, Japan reportedly approved the export of a second batch of photoresist to Samsung -- a key material for making semiconductors -- that will allow the company to maintain logic chip production for the next nine months.\n\nThe trade dispute started last year when South Korea's highest court ordered Japanese company Mitsubishi to compensate Koreans who were used as forced labourers during World War Two. The company refused to provide compensation and Japan claimed that all grievances were settled during a treaty in 1965.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nSamsung boss visits Tokyo amid Japan-Korea trade scuffle escalation\n\nSamsung boss JY Lee is reportedly planning talks with Japanese business leaders to discuss how to go forward with Japan's export restrictions.\n\nSamsung to prepare contingency plans for Korea-Japan trade scuffle\n\nSamsung leader JY Lee has told the company's semiconductor and display businesses to make contingency plans in the event that the trade dispute between South Korea and Japan continues to drag on.\n\nJapan imposes trade restrictions on South Korea for smartphone and chip materials\n\nThe Japanese government is also seeking consultation on whether South Korea should be removed from its 'white country list'.\n\nJapan to restrict foreign investment for domestic tech and telco companies\n\nAmong the affected industries are the telecommunications, semiconductor manufacturing, and mobile phone manufacturing sectors.\n\nJapan telcos pull back sale of new Huawei smartphones\n\nCiting consumer safety concerns and uncertainty over Google's Android support, SoftBank and KDDI have delayed the sale of new handsets from the Chinese vendor, specifically, the Huawei P30 lite, which had been slated to hit the local market on May 24.", "description": "Withdrawing from an intelligence sharing agreement with Japan alarmingly expands the scope of their trade dispute beyond being purely political and economic, making it also about security.", "authors": ["Cho Mu-Hyun"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/01/11/5bb1b79c-1d12-11e4-8c7f-00505685119a/thumbnail/770x578/9b2a030a734535cb2f27e308e91ea610/south-korea-flag.jpg"}
