The seller of the spot, Johnny Cheung Shun-yee, had recently moved three other parking spots at the same location, each of which has reportedly gone for six-figures in other sales.\n\nThe Center already set another record. In 2017, it became the world\u2019s most expensive commercial real estate transaction when it sold for $5.15 billion.\n\nData on what is the world\u2019s most expensive parking space is a bit cloudy. There is a claim that a luxury project in Hong Kong held the previous mark with a spot there costing $760,000.\n\nDespite recent pro-democracy protests having shaken Hong Kong, the value is apparently still strong in the luxury car space market. The parking space at The Center \u201cIs currently vacant\u201d according to the South China Morning Post.\n\n\u201cThe lot is on the top of The Center\u2019s three-level basement, reserved as executive parking for tenants only, and the sold unit sits against a wall with an alcove, which provides easier access for the owner,\u201d the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nThis sticker price isn\u2019t a huge shock for Hong Kong, which is tied with Paris and Singapore as the world\u2019s most expensive place to live. The average home price in Hong Kong is $1.2 million, putting into perspective the cost for prime parking.\n\nNew York City, of course, where space is at a premium, routinely sees parking spaces for sale in the seven figures. Brooklyn, for instance, is now seeing spaces going for $300,000.\n\nRenting in the city comes at a cost too, ranging in most areas from $400 a month to upward of $1,200 a month to lease a spot. Parking in the six figures, even in hip and trendy Brooklyn, is often the norm.\n\nBoston parking spaces are at a premium too, the market ranging from $50,000 to $350,000.", "description": "A parking spot at a high-rise office building in Hong Kong went for almost $1 million this week.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Hong-Kong-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
