The criminal gangs who perpetuate this are ruthless and do not care about loss of life.\n\n'We are working closely at all levels with the French authorities to tackle this dangerous and illegal activity.\n\n'In addition, Border Force cutters are patrolling the Channel and we have deployed equipment to detect migrant activity.\n\n'In August, the Home Secretary and her French counterpart agreed to intensify joint action to tackle small boat crossings in the Channel.\n\n'This includes drawing up an enhanced action plan to deploy more resource along the French coast to intercept and stop crossings.'\n\nLast month more than 20 migrants were picked up travelling across the English Channel in a single morning.\n\nMigrants are pictured being helped by authorities in Dover on Tuesday 10 September\n\nTwo small boats with 11 migrants each travelled across the Channel towards the UK shoreline in the early hours of Tuesday 10 September.\n\nThe two boats had nationals of Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, and the Philippines on board.\n\nThe individuals were taken to Dover, where they were medically assessed and found to be well, before being transferred to immigration officials for interview.", "description": "A group of ten migrants crossed the Channel and were intercepted by a Border Force coastal patrol vessel off the Kent coast around 8am today.
