So these casting announcements are roughly as big a deal to the Wheel of Time show as the reveal about which actors would play Harry, Ron, and Hermione in a Harry Potter adaptation.\n\nThe first casting announcement came a few weeks back \u2014 Rosamund Pike as Moiraine, a mysterious woman from a group of all-female magic wielders called the Aes Sedai, who serves as a mentor for the young heroes. (She\u2019s a sort of Dumbledore, to continue the Harry Potter analogy.) But unlike that announcement, today\u2019s casting is largely made up of young, relatively unknown actors, which reveals a lot about what Amazon is aiming for this show to be.\n\n\u201cIt was not about me. It\u2019s never been about me.\u201d @joshastradowsk1 as Rand Al\u2019Thor #WoTWednesday #TwitterOfTime pic.twitter.com/09sArPoM1g \u2014 The Wheel of Time on Prime (@WoTonPrime) August 14, 2019\n\nBy not investing in huge, big-name stars, Amazon is giving the show a chance to grow over time, without encountering a Game of Thrones situation. The length and popularity of that series meant that by the final season, Game of Thrones\u2019 A-list stars were demanding huge paydays. Along with the ballooning special-effects budget, that dynamic led the show to become the most expensive series ever made.\n\nWith potential for a Wheel of Time series to run as long as the Game of Thrones adaptation (even with heavy cuts to Jordan\u2019s admittedly bloated novels, there\u2019s tons of source material), the fact that Amazon isn\u2019t looking to blow its entire budget on established names seems encouraging. It gives fans the benefit of something new \u2014 instead of featuring familiar actors who come with their own preconceptions from earlier roles, the new cast will get a chance to make a fresh impression as these characters.\n\nThere\u2019s obviously still a long way to go before The Wheel of Time hits screens, and Amazon has yet to announce a release date. But each new piece of news makes it seem increasingly clear that the show is actually happening, as opposed to being some sort of late-night fever dream on FXX.", "description": "Amazon\u2019s upcoming adaptation of Robert Jordan\u2019s The Wheel of Time novels has announced its cast for the books\u2019 five central characters: Madeleine Madden as Egwene al\u2019Vere, Marcus Rutherford as Perrin Aybara, Barney Harris as Mat Cauthon, Zo\u00eb Robins as Nynaeve al\u2019Meara, and Josha Stradowski as Rand al\u2019Thor.
