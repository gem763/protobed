(Photo: Facebook)\n\nWhen a Texas school bus driver noticed that his elementary school passengers were standing in waist-high grass and weeds at their bus stop, in front of a vacant house, he took it upon himself to rectify the situation.\n\nJerry Martin Jr., who has been driving a school bus for Copperas Cove Independent School District for 18 years, finished his route on Wednesday, drove home and loaded up his lawnmower in his truck.\n\n\"I\u2019ve done it several times,\u201d Martin told KWTX. \u201cBut this time someone just took a picture.\u201d\n\nThe district recently applauded Martin's dedication to his students on their Facebook page, where they shared a photo of Martin mowing the lawn that serves as a bus stop.\n\nThe bus driver explained to the station that he worried the young students would be bitten by infant mites in the grass, called chiggers, that result in an itchy rash that could last for days.\n\n\u201cI mowed that lawn because my kids have to stand there, and tall grass attracts chiggers, so I didn\u2019t want my kids having to stand in it and get chigger bites,\u201d Martin told KWTX.\n\nAfter the district shared the photo, over 100 students and parents shared their own experiences with Martin.\n\n\u201cMr. Martin was my elementary bus driver and he would always have fresh fruit for us to take home and was my favorite bus driver ever. I\u2019m so happy he\u2019s still shedding some positive lights on students today,\" one person commented.\n\nOne mother shared: \"Mr. Martin is a genuinely great person. He drove my sons bus in kindergarten and Gage thought he hung the moon.\"\n\nAnother mom agreed: \"Mr Martin is a wonderful man we appreciate everything he does. We couldn\u2019t ask for a better bus driver to take care of our children.\"\n\n\"Not too surprised to see he\u2019s doing amazing things! He\u2019s an awesome person! Who remembers when he used to DJ at the school when we were kids?!\" a former student wrote, proving that Martin wears many hats to make sure \"his kids\" are taken care of: bus driver, groundskeeper, and now DJ.\n\nMartin's storied career as a bus driver also includes driving a Heisman Trophy winner and quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens.\n\n\u201cI used to drive a junior high student to his football games named Robert Griffin,\u201d Martin told the station.\n\nRepresentatives for Copperas Cove Independent School District did not immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment. Yahoo Lifestyle was not immediately able to locate Martin for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A Texas school bus driver took it upon himself to mow an overgrown bus stop, so his young students didn't have to stand in the weeds.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BYjowRWRyX2JORkDCLh2aQ--~B/aD04MTY7dz0xNDY4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/eb2ae5a0-e16e-11e9-8dc6-bb021db87f6a", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
