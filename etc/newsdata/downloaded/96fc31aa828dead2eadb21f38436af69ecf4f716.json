AP\n\nNorth Korean documents say Mr Kim's grandfather and national founder Kim Il Sung had an anti-Japan guerrilla base on Paektu's slopes during Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula. The official biography of Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, says the second-generation leader was born on Paektu when a double rainbow filled the skies.\n\nThe white horse is also a propaganda symbol for the Kim family, which has ruled North Korea for seven decades with a strong personality cult surrounding family members. State media have occasionally shown Mr Kim, his sister and his father riding white horses. The symbolism goes back to Kim Il Sung, who according to the North's official narrative rode a white horse while fighting Japanese colonial rulers.\n\nThere have been other horse-riding leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was photographed riding a horse bare-chested, and Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, who took part in horse races and erected a massive monument featuring his likeness atop a golden horse.\n\nKCNA said Mr Kim also visited nearby construction sites in Samjiyon County and complained about US-led UN sanctions imposed on his country because of its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The situation of the country is difficult owing to the ceaseless sanctions and pressure by the hostile forces and there are many hardships and trials facing us,\" Mr Kim was quoted as saying. \"But our people grew stronger through the trials and found their own way of development and learned how to always win in the face of trials.\"\n\nKim also said \"the pain the US-led anti-(North Korea) hostile forces inflicted upon the Korean people ... turned into their anger,\" according to KCNA. \"No matter what persistent efforts the enemy make, we can live well with our own efforts and pave the avenue to development and prosperity in our own way.\"\n\nNorth Korea has been slapped with 11 rounds of sanctions since 2006. The sanctions have been toughened since 2016, when Mr Kim began conducting a series of high-profile nuclear and missile tests, and they include a full ban on key exports such as coal, textiles and seafood and a significant curtailing of oil imports.\n\nDuring his second summit with President Donald Trump in Vietnam in February, Mr Kim demanded the United States lift the newer and more biting sanctions in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, a limited denuclearisation step. Mr Trump rejected that, and the summit collapsed without reaching any deal. The two leaders held a brief, impromptu meeting at the Korean border in late June and agreed to resume talks.\n\nTheir negotiators met in Sweden earlier this month for the first time since the Vietnam summit, but the talks broke down again. North Korea blamed the US for the breakdown and threatened to resume nuclear and long-range missile tests.\n\nNorth Korea's lifting of its self-imposed moratorium on major weapons tests would be a blow to Trump's reelection campaign, as the president has boasted that the moratorium is a big foreign policy achievement.\n\nSome experts say North Korea is not likely to carry out its threat to restart nuclear and long-range missile tests because that could scuttle diplomacy with Mr Trump and dim the chances of winning sanctions relief.\n\nMr Trump has downplayed the significance of North Korea's recent series of short- range missile tests. But the European members of the UN Security Council earlier this month urged Pyongyang to abandon all weapons of mass destruction and engage in \"meaningful negotiations\" with the United States.\n\nAAP", "description": "In a bizarre incident, the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is depicted riding a white horse to a snow covered mountain - a trip that is often a precursor to major policy announcements.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0527%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1009%2C$y_461/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/960feaf47a89575e9d54c36e7723abfe0d5c659e", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
