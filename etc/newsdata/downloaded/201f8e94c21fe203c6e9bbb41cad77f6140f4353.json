MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, one of the network\u2019s biggest stars, called out the company last week, saying she had confirmed some of Farrow\u2019s claims herself.\n\n\u201cNBC News repeatedly refused calls for an independent review on both counts despite numerous such requests from staff,\u201d the NBC News Guild said in a statement. \u201cThis lack of transparency and NBC News\u2019 troubling trend of passing on stories which investigate the powerful ultimately harm our credibility as journalists.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTwo NBC reporters who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity because they feared retribution cited those issues as a motivating factor for something like a union.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThose of us [who] may have not have had a stake in it directly now see another reason why it would be a good thing,\u201d one of the reporters said.\n\nBoth cited reports documenting college newspaper columns written by Noah Oppenheim, an executive at the company, more than 20 years ago. As a Harvard student, Oppenheim reportedly mocked feminists and blasted NBC for firing a sportscaster accused of sexual assault.\n\nFarrow wrote that Oppenheim was involved in the process that effectively killed a story about Weinstein. Oppenheim has said that Farrow distorted and exaggerated his depiction of the network in response. Some NBC reporters told The Post previously that they disputed Farrow\u2019s characterization of events, saying they stand by Oppenheim and a team of producers at NBC who have said his Weinstein story didn\u2019t meet NBC\u2019s reporting standards.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther issues cited by the NBC News Guild in its statement included pay disparities that split along racial and gendered lines, understaffing, excessive work, and transparency.\n\n\u201cManagement has indicated they are committed to addressing some of these issues\u2014ending nine-hour working shifts, adjusting weekend staffing, increasing standard vacation time, and implementing select pay raises,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile we strongly welcome any steps forward, we want to cement these adjustments into an enforceable contract.\u201d\n\nOne of the NBC reporters said a spreadsheet had circulated among staff where people self-reported their salary and demographic information anonymously. He said that gave people the impression that white men in the office were paid more than others.\n\nAD\n\nThe four NBC employees the News Guild said could speak on the record either declined interviews or did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAD\n\nThe union announcement, which was first reported by the New York Times, is part of rapid growth of union membership in newsrooms in the past few years, first at digital outlets in New York City and then in more traditional newsrooms like the Miami Herald, the Los Angeles Times and New York magazine.\n\nNewsrooms that have unionized in recent years include Vice, Slate, HuffPost, MTV News, the Intercept, the New Yorker and Vox Media.\n\nThe number of employees who have been unionized through these efforts has not been enough to stanch the loss of jobs that have dragged union participation down to its lowest percentage in decades. But the high visibility enjoyed by media companies and their reporters and editors has drawn outsize attention to these campaigns and helped give unions a feeling of growth and relevancy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe union drives are part of a broader trend toward employee activism in an era where political issues seep into nearly every aspect of life.\n\nNBC Universal, the group\u2019s parent company, declined to say whether it would voluntarily recognize its staff\u2019s union. Spokeswoman Emily Passer distributed a note Chris Berend, an executive vice president at the company, sent to digital staff on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI want you to know we are deeply committed to a fair and healthy workplace for all our employees,\u201d the email said. \u201cWe welcome this dialogue from within our digital organization, and any constructive conversation aimed at building the future of NBC News Digital and ensuring that we\u2019re the best we can be. We will address this request quickly, and will keep you updated every step of the way.\u201d\n\nSarah Ellison and Paul Farhi contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The company has been under public scrutiny after reporter Ronan Farrow alleged that it suppressed his reporting on sexual assault allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein and covered up accusations against Matt Lauer.", "authors": ["Eli Rosenberg", "Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pQdMt6LmQdDeJVdS_R71fK88t4c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/74QTXJWZLMI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
