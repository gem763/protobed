Jerrold Nadler and Adam B. Schiff late Thursday condemned the Justice Department for transforming its Russian probe review into a criminal investigation.\n\nIn a joint statement, Mr. Nadler of New York and Mr. Schiff of California, both Democrats and chairmen of the Judicial Committee and Intelligence Committee respectively, said the Justice Department has become a \u201cvehicle for President Trump\u2019s political retribution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese reports, if true, raise profound new concerns that the Department of Justice under AG [William P.] Barr has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump\u2019s political revenge,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cIf the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage,\u201d it continued.\n\nThe New York Times on Thursday reported the Justice Department shifted its probe of the Russia investigation\u2019s origins into a criminal investigation.\n\nJohn Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, is conducting the review, which is being closely watched by Mr. Barr.\n\nIt is not clear what prompted the change or what evidence of a potential crime Mr. Durham has uncovered.\n\nThe change gives Mr. Durham power. He can now subpoena documents and witness testimony.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
