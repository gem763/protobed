They are also now starting up in Colombia.\n\nCEO Mario Anglada told Yahoo Finance that Hoy Health is \u201ctaking time and distance out of the medical relationship. All we did was invent how to gift medication.\u201d\n\nRight now, Hoy has 8 employees, and a business model that\u2019s founded on one of the best kept secrets in health care: That cash payments often result in lower price tags for health services and products.\n\nAnglada views at current market as archaic and needlessly complex, and trying to simplify it. Given the silos that exist among providers due to increasingly complex systems like hospitals, he felt confident Hoy Health could offer improvements.\n\nBut the company insists it\u2019s not out to transform the health care market, or take on those who are trying to disrupt it \u2014 like Haven, the health venture formed by Amazon (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).\n\n\u201cI am not in the disruption business, and we don\u2019t need to be,\u201d Anglada said. \u201cYou can\u2019t disrupt health care.\u201d\n\nServing where Big Pharma doesn\u2019t\n\nBottles of medicine ride on a belt at the Express Scripts mail-in pharmacy warehouse, Tuesday, July 10, 2018, in Florence, N.J. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) More\n\nThe company\u2019s entry into health care comes at a time when the ranks of the uninsured having grown in 2018, according to U.S. Census Data \u2014 thanks in part to the repeal of Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, and mounting challenges to immigrant benefits.\n\nHoy\u2019s volume-driven model offers low-cost services and products, with the objective of penetrating one of the hardest markets for health care giants: Minority communities.\n\nAt around 2,500 users, Hoy\u2019s client base is still relatively small. The company has also faced some traditional startup headwinds like access to funding, but has successfully raised half of the $4 million in seed funding it needs.\n\nThe Hoy concept came from the collective experience of the team behind the startup; All served in leadership positions at some of the biggest health care companies in the country, including Bayer (BAYZF), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Novartis (NVS), and United Health (UNH), just to name a few.\n\nThat collective experience helped create Hoy Health\u2019s services, but it didn\u2019t solve the original problem: penetrating the Latin-American market.\n\nAccording to Anglada, big pharmaceutical companies do not engage with the Latino market \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t understand the nuances of how to engage.\u201d\n\nChief strategy officer Jose Aguilar told Yahoo Finance that Hoy is \u201ctargeting populations that Pharma is not targeting,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you hear about [ideas like Haven], it\u2019s all for employed populations. Nobody is talking about those who don\u2019t have insurance and don\u2019t have premiums,\u201d he added.\n\nHoy Health is on the ground floor searching for customers, in places like unions, trade groups, hospitals and clinics \u2014 and advertising to them directly or through social media.\n\nBut in order to attract customers, the company needed to employ a grassroots-level strategy and create a strong tracking model. That\u2019s how it came around to delivering medication to remote areas \u2014 within 36 hours of filling a prescription, according to Anglada.\n\n\u2018Next steps up the evolutionary ladder\u2019\n\nStory continues", "description": "Hoy Health launched less than two years ago, but sees strong growth potential in paving the way to the Latin American health care market.", "authors": ["Anjalee Khemlani", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_FGyPr3G3nWcJOwnTGdAvA--~B/aD0yNDYzO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/66075570-d4d5-11e9-98f7-1a40c1a07d2d", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
