But when Cormie attended the church\u2019s Sept. 8 service, he said he was surrounded by about 12 to 15 congregants, who held him down and demanded he renounce his sexuality.\n\n\u201cThey hold me down, pin me down, and I\u2019m crying, and the Holy Spirit just comes through me, and they keep speaking in tongues, praying over me,\u201d the 23-year-old recalled in a Monday interview with KFOR-TV, NBC\u2019s Oklahoma City affiliate. \u201cI was just crying, \u2018Mercy, mercy.\u2019\u201d\n\nCormie\u2019s partner, Gary Gardner, elaborated on the allegations further. Churchgoers, he told KWTV Monday, \u201csort of picked [Cormie] up and body slammed him over and started praying on him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSean ended up with marks on his arms, a black eye and sort of blacked out,\u201d Gardner added.\n\nCormie said his sister eventually convinced congregants to let him go. Upon leaving the church, he filed a police report with the Blackwell Police Department. While local law enforcement has not commented publicly on the allegations, Police Chief Dwayne Wood confirmed to NBC News Tuesday that an investigation is ongoing.\n\nFirst Assembly of God pastors Bill and Tami McKissick, meanwhile, responded to the accusations with a statement on the church\u2019s since-deleted Facebook page. Their congregation \u201cloves and is comprised of people from all different backgrounds,\u201d while the incident itself was \u201ca family matter that escalated.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur church would never condone restraint of any person unless they were engaged in violent activity,\u201d they wrote in the statement, which has been cited by The Advocate and the New York Daily News, among other outlets. \u201cThere is much more to this incident, and we are cooperating fully with law enforcement to hopefully bring all of the facts to light as a rush to judgment is not in anyone\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nCormie, meanwhile, is hopeful the church will be held accountable for its actions.\n\n\u201cI love the pastors with all my heart, but what they did was totally wrong, and I want some kind of consequences out of it,\u201d he told KFOR-TV. \u201cI\u2019m full-fledged gay, you can\u2019t change it. It\u2019s my nature. I\u2019m born that way, so let it be.\u201d", "description": "Sean Cormie said more than 10 congregants of the First Assembly of God Church also demanded he renounce his sexuality following a Sept. 8 service.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d829442230000170e57177f.png?cache=rxijw6jbll&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
