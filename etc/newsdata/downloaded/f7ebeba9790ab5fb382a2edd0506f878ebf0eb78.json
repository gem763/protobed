Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe 29-year-old, who had entered the competition with the fastest time of the season, ran the first kilometre in less than three minutes and stayed ahead of the pack for most of the race.\n\nWith four laps remaining, Germany\u2019s Konstanze Klosterhalfen and Margaret Kipkemboi of Kenya were a stride behind Obiri but she resisted the pressure and stayed in front.\n\nObiri\u2019s lead came under threat again at the bell but the Kenyan kept her composure, sprinting to increase the gap between herself and the pack to cross the finish line in 14 minutes 26.72 seconds, a championship record.\n\n\u201cWe have such great runners in Kenya,\u201d Obiri said. \u201cI worked hard to prove that we can win.\u201d\n\nKipkemboi won silver, finishing less than one second after Obiri, drawing applause and cheers from flag-waving Kenyan supporters.\n\nKlosterhalfen took the bronze with 14:28.43.\n\nKlosterhalfen is part of the Nike Oregon Project (NOP), an elite long-distance running training centre led by American coach Alberto Salazar who earlier this week was banned for four years for doping violations.\n\nThe 22-year-old German joins other NOP athletes to step on to the podium in Doha, including Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, who won gold in the 1,500m and 10,000m.\n\nKlosterhalfen said the scandal around Salazar had not disrupted her preparations for the race.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see the whole team performing well,\u201d she said. \u201cIt showed how good we trained.\u201d\n\nObiri had finished a disappointing fifth in the 10,000m last Saturday but refocused in time to redeem herself in the shorter race.\n\n\u201cI just told my coach to let me focus on the 5,000m and I will do my best,\u201d said Obiri, who added she might try the 10,000m again at next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics.", "description": "Hellen Obiri of Kenya displayed her dominance of the 5,000 metres at the world athletics championships on Saturday by winning a second consecutive world title in a tight race at Khalifa International Stadium.", "authors": ["Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437680897&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF950A2-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
