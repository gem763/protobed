In July, Attorney General William P. Barr said his department will use pentobarbital when the government resumes federal executions later this year.\n\nIt is not clear why the department contemplated and rejected fentanyl. Consideration of using the drug was disclosed in a court filing last month, Reuters reported.\n\nThe full contents of the filing are not public. The Justice Department declined to comment to Reuters.\n\nThe department mulled fentanyl as law enforcement continues to combat the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic. Fentanyl has become a common substitute for heroin because of its cheaper cost to manufacture and more powerful highs.\n\nIn 2017, Nebraska and Nevada accounted they would switch to fentanyl for state executions.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
