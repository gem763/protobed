(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Nationals won an elimination game for the first time on Tuesday, and they\u2019re not anxious to play in another one soon. But the Nats are facing that possibility after dreadful showings from their hitters and relievers in a 6-0 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the National League Division Series. Against this Dodgers juggernaut, the winners of the last two National League pennants, the Nationals know they cannot afford to return to Nationals Park on Sunday down 2-0 in a best-of-five series. They have Stephen Strasburg on the mound Friday night in Game 2, when they\u2019ll attempt to avoid that fate.\n\nThe Nationals are starting Strasburg three days after he tossed three crucial, scoreless innings in his first career relief appearance to set up a stunning comeback against the Milwaukee Brewers in the wild-card game. It\u2019s unclear how much Strasburg will have in the tank after he threw 34 pitches on Tuesday, in addition to his normal pregame routine. (Strasburg was on regular rest Tuesday.) This is a sharp departure from the routine Manager Dave Martinez credited for keying one of the most dominant and durable seasons of the pitcher\u2019s career. It\u2019s unclear how Strasburg will respond to the challenge, but the Nationals need him to rise to the occasion. The Dodgers are starting Clayton Kershaw, a dominant force in his own right and the man who closed out Game 5 against the Nats in the 2016 NLDS.\n\nThe biggest question for Washington is how long Strasburg can go. The best chance the Nationals have is if he goes at least seven innings, because the middle relief showed itself Thursday night as an existential threat to this season. If a left-handed hitter comes up in a crucial situation before the eighth inning, will Martinez deploy his only left-handed reliever, Sean Doolittle? Or will he trust veteran right-hander Fernando Rodney again? That, and the quiet bats, are the most important question marks headed into Friday night. The continued viability of the Nationals\u2019 season might depend on the answers.\n\nHow to watch\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers lead Washington Nationals, 1-0\n\nWhen: 9:37 p.m.\n\nWhere: Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.\n\nTV: TBS.\n\nStream: TBS.com.\n\nStarting pitchers: Stephen Strasburg (18-6, 3.32 ERA) vs. Clayton Kershaw (16-5, 3.03 ERA).\n\nLineups\n\nNationals\n\nTrea Turner SS\n\nAdam Eaton RF\n\nAnthony Rendon 3B\n\nJuan Soto LF\n\nHowie Kendrick 2B\n\nRyan Zimmerman 1B\n\nKurt Suzuki C\n\nVictor Robles CF\n\nStephen Strasburg P\n\nDodgers\n\nJoc Pederson RF\n\nJustin Turner 3B\n\nA.J.

There were tears in his eyes. \u201cI started thinking about my kids, my family, my players, this team,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I thought: \u2018Man, I am going to let so many people down.\u2019 \u201d (Read more)\n\nWith a playoff history full of nightmares, the Nats enter this year eyes wide open.
