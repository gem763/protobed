(John Raoux/Associated Press)\n\nOn Nov. 6, 1869, Rutgers defeated College of New Jersey (later Princeton) in the first known college football game, after which Rutgers established itself as the Power One, while New Jersey resorted to a less-moneyed but proud division known as Group of One.\n\nThe latter part of that actually didn\u2019t happen, but as college football reaches age 150 this fall, historians and other revelers should not overlook the sacred role of snobbery and entitlement and caste in helping build college football into a perennial national festival of resentment cherished by so many.\n\nAlso, Stanford (1-1) of the alleged Power Five will play at No. 17 Central Florida (2-0) of the alleged Group of Five on Saturday, weather permitting.\n\nAt this moment in the 150 years, UCF and the fans of a program merely 40 years old breathe as exemplars of the tradition of ambitious outsiders. They ram against a football caste system in a country where people often take a rugged sport and refer to its titans as \u201cblue bloods,\u201d sometimes quibbling over which programs are \u201cblue bloods\u201d and which are not and which are not quite. The Knights (27-1 since 2017) aren\u2019t in the Power Five but have shown in recent years a caliber superior to so much of said Power Five.\n\nThis creates a setting in which Power Five schools have caught the newfangled viral strain of fear of UCF, thus shrink from any unselfish future scheduling of UCF, all while UCF needs to schedule Power Five schools to attain Power Five caste.\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar brew of snobbery and resentment, as when one Knights fan said, \u201cOh, we\u2019re on Cloud Nine,\u201d and then followed up that immediately with, \u201cWe\u2019re still fighting the fight against the Power Five. I hate to even say \u2018Power Five,\u2019 because it really doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\u201d\n\n[Alabama is penalizing students for leaving football games early. Is that normal?]\n\nThat fan, Andrew Phegley, co-hosts the oldest Knights-centered podcast and views home games from the stands in part because he finds the hushed neutrality of the media box too confining. He played walk-on defensive back at Kansas from 1992 to \u201996. He moved to Orlando in 2008. Before a date invited him to a UCF home game against Rice in 2010, he had not heard of any football at UCF.\n\nHe became part of that rare fan base which witnessed a program going from 12-1 (2013) to 0-12 (2015) to 13-0 (2017), for an Orlando school with the nation\u2019s largest undergraduate enrollment, where classes began on Monday, Oct. 7, 1968, or just as No. 4 Ohio State prepared to shut out No. 1 Purdue and remind Purdue of the accepted order.\n\nUpon request, Phegley supplied a state of the union of UCF fans, for whom caste-system issues take up much more chatter time than they do for, say, Alabama fans.\n\n\u201cTons of it,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially on social media. The UCF Twitter mafia argues with these people all the time. Because they\u2019re the ones who don\u2019t understand. They don\u2019t understand where we\u2019re coming from. Because they\u2019re with teams have been around a hundred years or something. They had it all handed to them.\u201d\n\nSuch an arrangement has occasional value. It lent untold meaning on Oct. 28, 2000, when Javier Beorlegui kicked a 37-yard field goal with three seconds left to give UCF a 40-38 win at Alabama, a game whose accounts included unthinkable passages such as \u201cthe Crimson Tide (3-5).\u201d\n\nThat game stood as paramount in UCF football history, until a 10-6 win over Georgia in the December 2010 Liberty Bowl, which stood until a 52-42 win over favored Baylor in the 2013 Fiesta Bowl, which stood until a 34-27 ransacking of a pitiful Auburn in the 2017 Peach Bowl. That last one almost got a rival with the 2018 Fiesta Bowl, but UCF lost, 40-32 to LSU, some 39 days after a horrendous injury took away UCF quarterback McKenzie Milton.\n\nIn the day-to-day, meanwhile, UCF fans ingest social-media sneering from the blue-blooded, including unsolicited recommendations that UCF ought to join a bigger conference which, of course, would require an invitation.\n\nMeanwhile, the conference in which UCF plays, the 12-team American Athletic, is good.\n\nIts prospective pathways to the four-team College Football Playoff are less good.\n\nThose in the know recommend a scenario like the one envisioned for a spell with Houston in 2016: beat a nonconference somebody like Oklahoma (which Houston did), then go unbeaten (which Houston didn\u2019t).\n\nGood luck with that, and compound that with the fact that in recent years, UCF has seen potentially helpful games with Power Five opponents Georgia Tech and North Carolina canceled due to scary weather. Now comes Stanford, fresh from rankings removal after the unexpected 45-20 mauling it took at Southern California, and nobody\u2019s idea of a villain, unless one counts Cal. After that comes a trip to Pittsburgh.\n\nPower Five is inbound, and the buzz ticks upward for fans and key visitors. \u201cYou know, we typically have a bunch of recruits at every one of our home games,\u201d UCF Coach Josh Heupel said at his weekly news conference, \u201cbut, you know, the guys that we\u2019re recruiting are excited about this game. We\u2019re going to have a large contingency of recruits that will be here. It\u2019s going to be an electric atmosphere.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the second part of a home-and-home, the first concluded in 2015, the year Stanford beat visiting UCF, 31-7, with such delights as a seven-yard touchdown reception by Christian McCaffrey and a 93-yard touchdown reception by Bryce Love. This one finds UCF with a compelling puzzle at quarterback featuring the true freshman Dillon Gabriel (from the same Hawaiian high school as Milton), the Notre Dame graduate transfer Brandon Wimbush and the freshly available Darriel Mack Jr., who shined at times last December in replacing Milton.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different type of football game that we\u2019re getting ready to play,\u201d Heupel told reporters, citing Stanford\u2019s renowned physicality and foreseeing a \u201climited number of opportunities, number of drives for you offensively. You\u2019ve got to maximize those things.\u201d\n\nAbout 2,500 miles away last Monday, Stanford Coach David Shaw spoke of UCF\u2019s offense, No. 5 total and No. 11 in yards per play in major college football, and said: \u201cWe\u2019ve played fast teams before but I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve played anybody this fast in multiple years. This will be the quickest-tempo team we\u2019ve played in years. .\u201d\n\nUCF is, of course, the touchdown-ish favorite.\n\nIt could raise its record in the 2010s to 8-13 against teams that inhabit the Power Five.\n\nIt could raise its record since 2017 against those teams to 4-1.\n\nIt could continue perfecting the hard, old art of the simultaneous winning of the game and the argument, a burden first felt surely by the College of New Jersey.", "description": "The No. 17 Knights, who will host Stanford on Saturday, are the current exemplars of the college football tradition of ambitious outsiders.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports.", "September At Pm", "Chuck Culpepper Covers National College Sports", "As Well As Some Tennis", "Some Golf"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Y_1_eVgoOhQ3xOBnEpZGC6QDRJ4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/U3FQLSXX54I6RDLEJZ45WMZYF4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
