The complaint also demonstrated that many of his own advisers understood the explosive nature of the conversation, which Trump insists \"was perfect.\"\n\nThis was evident in one camp of Trump aides who sought to \u201clock down\u201d the official record of the conversation. Someone in that camp moved the record from the normal computer platform on which it would reside and could be viewed by Cabinet members and other senior aides. Instead, it was placed on a separate computer system reserved for highly secretive matters.\n\nThat act alone was inappropriate and smacks of a cover-up. (And there might have been others: The whistleblower said White House officials told him this was \"not the first time\" a presidential transcript was moved to the more secure system for political reasons.) The whistleblower\u2019s complaint provides ample reason for Congress to subpoena witnesses to ascertain who was hiding what, why and on whose orders.\n\nInvestigators should also look into whether the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel and White House counsel's office acted properly in providing legal cover for trying to keep the complaint away from the congressional intelligence committees.\n\nRedacted pages of the whistleblower complaint released on Sept. 26, 2019.

In fact, the old adage that \u201cthe cover-up is worse than the crime\u201d might not be true in this instance.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint lays out a detailed, credible case that the president misused the power of his office \"to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\" using Attorney General William Barr and personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani as intermediaries.\n\nAs with the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s, a president seeking reelection sought to undermine his Democratic Party rivals. Even Richard Nixon, however, tried to stay at arm's-length from the campaign of dirty tricks.\n\nIn this case, the dirty tricks are alleged to have come from the president himself. With the power and prestige of the United States behind him, and knowing that Ukraine is reliant on U.S. military aid, Trump asked Zelensky only July 25 to investigate former Vice President Biden, then his toughest potential opponent in next year\u2019s election.\n\nThe cover-up alleged by the whistleblower is troubling enough. But the underlying acts and flagrant abuse of presidential power are the most damning.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.
