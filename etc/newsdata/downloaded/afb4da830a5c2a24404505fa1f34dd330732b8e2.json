'Scout leaders' are pictured\n\nThe unique aspect of the adult-only festival is a far cry from many of the UK\u2019s mainstays where the focus is on survival rather than thriving the day after the night before.\n\nCamp Wildfire, which takes place in West Kingsdown - near Sevenoaks, boasts a choice of dozens of activities with each person sorted into a scout group under the banner of an animal patrol, a place to act like kids, without bringing - or being allowed to bring - them.\n\nBut whether you\u2019re a Hawk or a Badger, Fox or Squirrel, Lee says the goal remains on creating a unique atmosphere which brings people together, partly through competitive tasks between the scout groups.\n\n\u2018People challenge themselves, learn new things, make new friends and feel really great! This gives the event an incredible atmosphere of camaraderie and joy, which in turn creates another amazing party,\u2019 Lee said.\n\nCamp Wildfire, which takes place in West Kingsdown - near Sevenoaks, boasts a choice of dozens of activities alongside live music spanning everything from folk to house\n\nOne of the activity leaders in the beautiful, off the beaten track setting for the festival addresses a jubilant bunch of scouts\n\nLee created the festival with his partner Jules in 2014, and their inspiration for the niche theme emanated from their love of Wes Anderson\u2019s film Moonrise Kingdom. Quad bikes are pictured\n\nThe Londoner added: \u2018Rekindling our innate sense of curiosity and providing opportunities to satisfy it seems to make people truly happy.\u2019\n\nHe created the festival with his partner Jules in 2014, and their inspiration for the niche theme emanated from their love of Wes Anderson\u2019s film Moonrise Kingdom where the two main characters are young scouts.\n\nMuch of the focus is on the activities, with the roaring of quad bikes taking place in a field also occupied by a trapeze, zorbing arena, rifle shooting, crossbow shooting and archery lanes - but it is not without its music.\n\nAmong the 60 plus choices of activities is a huge trapeze, not for the feint-hearted\n\nThis year\u2019s installment, the fifth anniversary of Camp Wildfire, was closed by none other than DJ Carl Craig and the line up included other big names like DJ Yoda, and even Jules\u2019s band Keston Cobblers Club.\n\nLee admits it is hard to define the festival due to its many facets but puts it simply when turning to why he has put five years of his life into perfecting it.\n\n\u2018One day we were discussing what we want to contribute to the world and we came up with an idea\u2026 what if we could combine the best bits of the festivals with the incredible feeling you get from learning and discovery?\u2019\n\nThis year\u2019s installment, the fifth anniversary of Camp Wildfire, was closed by none other than DJ Carl Craig and the line up included other big names like DJ Yoda, and even Jules\u2019s band\n\nHe added that he and Jules set out to \u2018create the UK's first-ever Summer Camp for Adults.\u2019\n\nHe calls the boutique festival, which plays host to just a couple of thousand people, \u2018A place that people can feel as confident, inspired and silly as they did when they were kids; making it easy to try new things and meet new people.\u2019\n\nLee added: \u2018That was five years ago and we've been developing the idea with the amazing community that has snowballed around it since!\u2019\n\nTree climbers take the canopies of the beautiful forest that surrounds the festival grounds, and plays host to many of the activities\n\nThe festival now is an explosion of colour and energy set in the clearing of a forest on the edge of an old family estate dating back centuries - but it has its roots in Lee\u2019s mother and father\u2019s back garden.\n\nAs a 16-year-old Lee threw a party in his back garden in Beckenham when his parents were holidays - and the avid organiser took it to thee extreme, inviting hundreds of people to \u2018LeeFest\u2019 - which still runs today under the new name of Neverworld.\n\nOn that day in August 2006, 150 people attended to watch seven bands perform on a garden stage and the money raised from ticket sales went to the charity, Teenage Cancer Trust.\n\n\u2018People challenge themselves, learn new things, make new friends and feel really great!' Lee, pictured with his partner Jules, told Femail\n\nCamp Wildfire\u2019s success hasn't gone unnoticed, it won the Best Small Festival gong at the Festival Awards and The Independent described it as \u2018something more exciting\u2019\n\nThe following year the festival took place again in Lee's garden, with an increase of attendees to around 350 and money raised was donated to Save The Children.\n\n\u2018Since then we've put on hundreds of club nights and festivals. Those taught us how to put on an amazing party, but we always felt that there was something missing. We wanted our work to give people more than just a hangover!\u2019 he said, explaining the transition towards Camp Wildfire.\n\nCamp Wildfire\u2019s success hasn't gone unnoticed, it won the Best Small Festival gong at the Festival Awards and The Independent described it as \u2018something more exciting\u2019 than your usual festival and one attendee, one of many escaping their hectic London lives for three days, said on the way out: \u2018I\u2019ve done so much in three days that I would have been happy achieving in a lifetime.\u2019\n\nPeople queue up for the giant waterslide which straddles the same hill that the quad bikes zip by to go off road in the countryside", "description": "Tucked away in a secluded corner in the rolling hills of Kent, Camp Wildfire is a party with a difference - that is changing how people think about music festivals.", "authors": ["Leigh Mcmanus For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/21/00/18742418-0-image-a-118_1569022043279.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
