(Richter still played, at No 8, and had been responsible for both SA tries, a quirky carbon copy of the situation against the Romanians.)\n\nBut then perpetual tetchiness suddenly exploded into more violent, open warfare through a mass brawl which saw two Canadians - flyhalf and captain Gareth Rees and prop Rod Snow - red-carded and the Boks losing volatile hooker James Dalton in the same way.\n\nAn emotional, contrite \u201cBullet\u201d protested later that he had gone in as a peacemaker \u2026 though his body language had looked well less than conciliatory as he galloped into the fray.\n\nBut both he and wing Pieter Hendriks, who had also been deemed a central figure in the almost ice hockey-like punch-fest, were banned from the tournament.\n\nOn the brighter side, the Boks were through to the quarter-finals, and Hendriks\u2019 omission paved the way for fit-again icon Chester Williams to return to the mix: he promptly scored four tries in a 42-14 dismantling of Samoa.\n\nSA 51 Canada 18 (East London, 2000)\n\nFive years on, there was very little, lingering acrimony from the PE slugout as the Boks opened their 2000 Test year with a \u201cwarm-up\u201d encounter (ahead of a two-Test visit from emerging heavyweights England) against the Canadians.\n\nNow led by second-rower Al Charron, the Canadians proved spirited enough, reasonably durable opponents - especially considering that they leaked roughly a point a minute for the high-tempo first 25 or thereabouts from the Boks - but were still much better beaten than in \u201995.\n\nThis time, the floodgates opened in a more pronounced way in the try column, South Africa dotting eight alone of the 10.\n\nIt was the first game as new, full-time Bok skipper by loose forward Andre Vos, although he had led the cause against Spain at the 1999 World Cup.\n\nThe Boks fielded a notably Stormers-heavy starting XV, including pairing green-and-gold first-timer De Wet Barry in midfield with his more established Newlands ally Robbie Fleck, who was also the only noteworthy disciplinary transgressor in the Test, earning a yellow card.\n\nBut there were two further Bok debutants off the bench, Thinus Delport \u2026 and a certain John \u201cBarney\u201d Smit.\n\nLittle would the watching East Londoners at ABSA Stadium know at the time that the versatile front-rower would go on to earn a massive total of 111 caps in an 11-year Bok career and lead the national team to glory along the way at RWC 2007.\n\nThe Bok try list on the day include a brace each for Breyton Paulse (one a thrilling 75-metre dash) and Fleck, while the line-up was also notable for current coach Rassie Erasmus playing at No 6 flank.\n\nIt was a deceptive Bok triumph, as clouds would soon start to gather around then-coach Nick Mallett, not helped by a one-from-five record in the next handful of Tests that year \u2026\n\nTuesday's match at Kobe Misaki Stadium is scheduled for 12:15 (SA time).\n\nTeams:\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Damian Willemse, 14 Warrick Gelant, 13 Damian de Allende, 12 Frans Steyn, 11 Sbu Nkosi, 10 Elton Jantjies, 9 Cobus Reinach, 8 Francois Louw, 7 Kwagga Smith, 6 Siya Kolisi, 5 Franco Mostert, 4 RG Snyman, 3 Vincent Koch, 2 Schalk Brits, 1 Thomas du Toit\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Frans Malherbe, 19 Eben Etzebeth, 20 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 21 Herschel Jantjies, 22 Handre Pollard, 23 Willie le Roux\n\nCanada\n\n15 Andrew Coe; 14 Jeff Hassler, 13 Conor Trainor, 12 Ciaran Hearn, 11 DTH van der Merwe; 10 Peter Nelson, 9 Phil Mack; 8 Tyler Ardron (captain), 7 Matt Heaton, 6 Lucas Rumball; 5 Kyle Baillie, 4 Evan Olmstead; 3 Jake Ilnicki, 2 Andrew Quattrin, 1 Hubert Buydens\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Benoit Piffero, 17 Djustice Sears-Duru, 18 Matt Tierney, 19 Josh Larsen, 20 Michael Sheppard, 21 Jamie Mackenzie, 22 Shane O'Leary, 23 Guiseppe du Toit\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "<strong>Rob Houwing</strong> winds back the clock to the two (far from uneventful) earlier tussles between South Africa and Canada, Tuesday\u2019s RWC 2019 combatants.", "authors": ["Rob Houwing", "Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7901/9ee841f0530c45618e9185c9c7c79a02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
