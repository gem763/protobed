In retrospect, I realize that my comments were unprofessional and inappropriate. My overexuberance in support of a player has been misrepresented as a demonstration of a regressive attitude about an important social issue. Those that know me know that I am a progressive member of the community, and a loving and committed husband and father. I hope that those who do know me understand that the Sports Illustrated article does not reflect who I am or my values. I am sorry if anyone was offended by my actions.\"\n\nPer USA Today's Bob Nightengale, Major League Baseball announced an investigation into the incident that includes interviewing those involved before making an official comment.\n\nOsuna, who gave up a game-tying two-run homer to DJ LeMahieu in the top of the ninth inning against the Yankees, was acquired by Houston in July 2018.\n\nThe 24-year-old was serving a 75-game suspension for violating MLB's domestic violence policy at the time of the trade following a May arrest in which he was charged with assaulting a woman.\n\nLast September, the charge against Osuna was dropped when the complainant\u2014with whom Osuna has a son\u2014declined to travel to Canada from Mexico to testify. Osuna also agreed to a deal that would require him to stay away from the woman for one year and continue to attend counseling.\n\nTaubman had worked with the Astros since 2013 when he was hired to their baseball operations department. He was promoted to assistant general manager prior to the 2018 season.", "description": "The  Houston Astros  have fired assistant general manager Brandon Taubman in the wake of his comments to a group of female reporters about closer  Roberto Osuna .
