REUTERS/Andres Martinez Casares\n\nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has deported over 300 Indian nationals to New Delhi, the National Migration Institute (INM) said late on Wednesday, in what it described as an unprecedented transatlantic deportation.\n\nThe 310 men and one woman that INM said were in Mexico illegally were sent on a chartered flight, accompanied by federal immigration agents and Mexico\u2019s National Guard.\n\nThe people had been scattered in eight states around the country, INM said, including in southern Mexico where many Indian migrants enter the country, hoping to transit to the U.S. border.\n\n\u201cIt is unprecedented in INM\u2019s history - in either form or the number of people - for a transatlantic air transport like the one carried out on this day,\u201d INM said in a statement.\n\nThe Mexican government in June struck a deal with the United States, vowing to significantly curb U.S.-bound migration in exchange for averting U.S. tariffs on Mexican exports.\n\nCaitlyn Yates, a research coordinator at IBI Consultants who has studied increasing numbers of U.S.-bound Asian and African migrants arriving in Mexico, said the backlog of migrants in southern Mexico has grown as officials have stopped issuing permits for them to cross the country.\n\n\u201cThis type of deportation in Mexico is the first of its kind but likely to continue,\u201d Yates said.", "description": "Mexico has deported over 300 Indian nationals to New Delhi, the National Migration Institute (INM) said late on Wednesday, in what it described as an unprecedented transatlantic deportation.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441985971&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1WB", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
