Funny or Die isn\u2019t an Emmy-winning TV and film production company, but an incipient start-up best known for a cell-phone video of a swearing child. Zach Galifianakis isn\u2019t beloved by throngs of frat boys and alt-comedy fans alike because of The Hangover and Baskets; instead, he\u2019s merely recognized by a smaller faction of those groups for cult hits like Out Cold and The Comedians of Comedy. And in the era before Comedy Bang! Bang! became a podcast, the name Scott Aukerman probably only rang a bell to L.A.-based comedy nerds and literary agents. That all started to change when Between Two Ferns, co-created by Aukerman and B.J. Porter, was uploaded to Funny or Die. The show helped put that company and those comedians on the map, and had a big hand in shaping the next decade of comedy, online and off.\n\nThis week, we\u2019ll find out the answer to the age-old question: \u201cCan a short-form absurdist web series about celebrities being berated in between two potted plants translate into a feature-length film?\u201d In honor of the debut of Aukerman and Galifianakis\u2019s Between Two Ferns: The Movie on Netflix on Friday, we\u2019ve ranked all 22 episodes that have been released since 2008. Despite this being a list from worst to first, it\u2019s a testament to Galifianakis and his writers that there really aren\u2019t that many clunkers.\n\n22. \u201cBruce Willis\u201d (2010)\n\nBruce Willis is usually pretty good at the whole acting thing. However \u2014 and my apologies to devotees of the 1999 Matthew Perry vehicle The Whole Nine Yards and its 2005 sequel The Whole Ten Yards \u2014 comedic acting is not his strong suit. Willis spends most of the episode answering questions with one-word grumbles, then launches into a monologue reminiscing about his sordid glory days as a 20-something in Hollywood. There\u2019s also an advertisement for Speed Stick deodorant sandwiched in between. Compared to the put-on irritation of other guests, Willis seems genuinely annoyed to have to do this. You\u2019re better off watching Red, the movie Willis was promoting, than this episode. Here\u2019s a clip from Red where Dame Helen Mirren fires a machine gun. You\u2019re welcome.\n\n21. \u201cBrad Pitt\u201d (2014)\n\nCompared to comedy movies and TV shows, short-form comedy like sketches, web videos, and stand-up tend to age poorly. Sometimes it\u2019s due to changing societal standards or simply a style becoming hack. Other times it\u2019s because admitted serial sexual abuser Louis C.K. interrupts the show to do a minute of stand-up. Galifianakis bringing Louis on might\u2019ve helped this episode go a pinch more viral in 2014. But watching it in 2019, it\u2019s just a turd in Brad Pitt\u2019s very handsome and funny punch bowl.\n\n20. \u201cJon Hamm\u201d (2008)\n\nJon Hamm is every L.A. comedian\u2019s funniest non-comedian friend. Unfortunately, that makes this episode that much more disappointing given that we know from the handsome Mad Men star\u2019s IMDb page just how funny he is. To be fair, this episode was released several years before both Mad Men\u2019s explosion in popularity and Hamm\u2019s comedic breakthrough in Bridesmaids, so our higher expectations are literally from the future. But the episode would rank much higher if Hamm displayed his now-evident comedic chops instead of playing the steely straight man \u2014 especially when Galifianakis sneezes directly into his notorious Hamm hog.\n\n19. \u201cJames Franco\u201d (2013)\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing James Franco loves doing, it\u2019s alluding to possibly, just maybe, being a 1 on the Kinsey Scale. A soft 1. So it\u2019s not shocking that Franco agreed to appear in this fake-out episode that morphs into a typically boisterous Lonely Island music video about gay marriage. Gay marriage and spring break. It\u2019s a little one-note, missing the third-verse turn that sets the Lonely Island apart from other musical comedy acts. Then again, we also have to judge it in context of the year it was released: 2013, which saw a floodgate of legislative statutes and court decisions legalizing gay marriage in 8 more states, bringing the total to 17 and helping solidify what would soon become the law of the land. Clearly, the episode is very much a product of its time.\n\n18. \u201cJennifer Aniston & Tila Tequila\u201d (2011)\n\nTila Tequila, huh? Who would\u2019ve thought that the model, reality star, and winner of the Spike TV Guys Choice Award for \u201cSo Hot They\u2019re Famous\u201d would be so prophetic about the rise of 21st-century neo-Nazism!? Alas, this interview was filmed a couple years before the decidedly not-white Tequila came out of the closet as someone devoted to preserving the white race. Lucky for us, Jennifer Aniston \u2014 along with an appearance from Brody Stevens \u2014 is played onstage to a MIDI cover of the Friends theme song to save the episode from the uncharismatic Tequila. She and Galifianakis bond over their shared Greek heritage; whereas Aniston\u2019s fellow thespian father, John, changed his last name from Anastassakis, Zack reveals that his surname was shortened as well from Galifianakisberg. This episode is also notable for being the last episode directed by B.J. Porter, BTF co-creator and former comedy partner of Scott Aukerman.\n\n17. \u201cMichael Cera\u201d (2008)\n\nThe very first episode of BTF is nowhere near its best, but it serves its purpose as a clear blueprint for the series. Released in January 2008 \u2014 a year before The Hangover made Galifianakis a household name and several years before most of those households could pronounce his name \u2014 episode No. 1 sets the tone, with the combative host grilling a then-rising Michael Cera. Given Galifianakis\u2019s lack of mainstream fame at this point, you can imagine early viewers wondering why this weird man was being so rude to the nice young boy from Superbad and Juno. The episode also features a rougher production quality and 480p resolution that\u2019s a more natural fit to its public-access inspirations. I kind of wish they\u2019d kept the aesthetic for bigger episodes like President Obama, which was shot in HD and ended on a gag revealing they were in the White House. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.\n\n16. \u201cOscar Buzz Edition Part 1\u201d (2013)\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus, BTF returned in 2013 with a two-part Oscar special where Galifianakis slung rapid-fire insults at some of that ceremony\u2019s A-list nominees. As you might expect, it\u2019s hit or miss, but at least the bombs are swiftly ushered offstage in a manner that\u2019d make the Apollo Theater\u2019s Sandman proud. First up is Jennifer Lawrence in a try-hard appearance that won\u2019t win over her detractors. J.Law is a great actress, but her fake anger at Galifianakis pales in comparison to the real anger she\u2019s shown in the past to interviewers. Speaking of contrived performances, Anne Hathaway shows up playing fake drunk. She would win an Oscar just days after this though, so I\u2019m guessing her character in Les Mis\u00e9rables did not imbibe. Thankfully, all of this is followed by the much-funnier fantasy police-procedural duo of (Christoph) Waltz and (Naomi) Watts. The MVP of the episode, though, is Amy Adams, who lends her gravitas to the line \u201cDon\u2019t you ever fart on my tits again\u201d to close things out.\n\n15. \u201cSteve Carell\u201d (2010)\n\nSteve Carell has long been Tom Hanks\u2019s chief competitor for the title of Hollywood\u2019s No. 1 Nice Guy, but he comes in hot and nasty on this 2010 episode. It\u2019s almost like a comic book where the main villain is vanquished by an even more \u00dcber-powerful bad guy on page three, forcing him to team up with the hero (the audience) to restore the usual good guy\u2013bad guy dynamic of its universe. At first, Galifianakis combats the reverse flow of insults by trying to conduct a straight interview with normal questions. But when that fails, he feigns sadness over the pressure he feels from \u201cthe Jews\u201d about Hollywood\u2019s distaste for actors who fall in between comically overweight and super fit. It stops Carell in his tracks and allows Galifianakis to regain the upper hand, not unlike Captain America gaining the ability to use Thor\u2019s hammer at the end of Avengers: Endgame.\n\n14. \u201cHillary Clinton\u201d (2016)\n\nThe 2016 election was supposed to be a cakewalk for Hillary Clinton. A little Nae Nae on Ellen here, a little Pok\u00e9mon Go to the polls over there, and then to tie a nice bow on it, an episode of BTF. But whereas President Obama\u2019s episode felt truly shocking and groundbreaking, this one has the unmistakable stench of a late-September Hail Mary to increase her relatability. The ironic thing is \u2026 it actually works. Clinton is relaxed and charming on this public access\u2013meets\u2013Charlie Rose Show scenario. Unfortunately, that didn\u2019t necessarily translate into a top-ten Between Two Ferns installment \u2026 or, you know, an election win.\n\n13. \u201cJimmy Kimmel\u201d (2008)\n\nLike most stand-up appearances, TV shows, and films that Brody Stevens turned up in, this episode was stolen by the late, great comedian. Kimmel does a fine job reacting with mild disgust to Galifianakis\u2019s treatment to him, but it\u2019s Stevens, dressed in a banana suit to hawk bananas \u2014 no particular brand, just the fruit \u2014 whom viewers will remember. Galifianakis and Stevens were longtime pals, and when the former\u2019s career skyrocketed, he made sure that his talented but troubled friend\u2019s genius wouldn\u2019t be limited to L.A. comedy-club audiences. But Stevens didn\u2019t just steal scenes in blockbuster movies. Galifianakis used his immense post-Hangover clout to sell Brody Stevens: Enjoy It!, an HBO (and later, Comedy Central) show that documented Stevens\u2019s struggle with the mental illness that eventually led to his suicide. Stevens\u2019s cameo here reminds you that Galifianakis\u2019s BTF persona is far from the kind and thoughtful person he is in real life.\n\n12. \u201cNatalie Portman\u201d (2009)\n\nWhether playing a little girl who befriends an assassin, a teenage queen turned guerrilla fighter turned galactic senator, or a brilliant astrophysicist forced to babysit a bumbling hammer-wielding god, Natalie Portman has routinely taken on roles where she portrays the only grown-up in the room. It\u2019s not much different in this solidly funny episode from early on in BTF\u2019s run. There\u2019s very little comedy on Portman\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but she\u2019s a very commendable straight woman, letting the silence build when asked if she shaved her \u201cV for Vagina\u201d during the filming of V for Vendetta. The real star of the episode is Portman\u2019s toy dog, who plops on his back for much of the interview, serving up Galifianakis\u2019s improvised close-out line: \u201cI got a bigger dick than that.\u201d\n\n11. \u201cHappy Holidays Edition\u201d (2013)\n\nThis unlisted holiday episode from 2013 is hard to find; it\u2019s only available if you have the link. Why is it unlisted, you (and a YouTube user named Cleezus) might ask? \u201cMaybe because of the jokes? People nowadays tend to be offended easily,\u201d posits another YouTube commentator named Animus Zero. But to paraphrase Jane\u2019s Addiction, there\u2019s nothing particularly shocking about this episode. It\u2019s just your typically great episode of BTF where two A-listers (Samuel L Jackson and Tobey Maguire) get roasted over the greatest hits on their IMDb page. Besides Christmas lights in the ferns, the only holiday-related aspect of this episode is a special appearance by all 87 members of Reflektor-era Arcade Fire to close out the episode with a lo-fi rendition of \u201cLittle Drummer Boy.\u201d\n\n10. \u201cWill Ferrell & Jon Hamm\u201d (2011)\n\nA strangely nice episode, at least in its first few minutes. In a welcome reprieve from the web series\u2019s usual shtick of Galifianakis playing an alt\u2013insult comic, the appearance of Funny or Die boss man Will Ferrell is notable for its fist bumps, bro hugs, and cherry feedings by hand and mouth. But the pleasantries quickly vanish as Galifianakis soon finds himself being verbally abused by a young girl who strolls on set. The episode is also noteworthy for prominently featuring a clip of a chimpanzee forcing a frog to go down on him while a child wails in the background. When the oral history of Funny or Die is written, I hope they interview the clearance coordinator responsible for bringing that clip to the attention of over 12 million viewers.\n\n9. \u201cOscar Buzz Edition Part 2\u201d (2013)\n\nPart two of BTF\u2019s first and only Oscar special features the series\u2019s best sight gag: Galifianakis introducing Daniel Day-Lewis, only for Webster\u2019s Emmanuel Lewis to walk on set. Unlike the late Gary Coleman, Lewis\u2019s fellow diminutive actor who starred in an \u201980s sitcom about a black child adopted by a rich white family, the Webster star has mainly stayed out of the spotlight since his heyday. Lewis\u2019s surprising cameo appearance is brief, as are the appearances by Jessica Chastain and Sally Field. That\u2019s because this episode belongs to repeat guest Bradley Cooper. Galifianakis\u2019s former co-star returns this time as an Oscar nominee, the first of seven nominations he\u2019s received for acting, producing, and writing. He and Galifianakis get into a very realistic argument that ends with the latter getting knocked unconscious by a plant to the head. Don\u2019t worry, it wasn\u2019t one of the ferns.\n\n8. \u201cJerry Seinfeld & Cardi B\u201d (2018)\n\nPoor Jerry Seinfeld. First those damn college kids don\u2019t laugh at his jokes, then he gets upstaged by Cardi B on his own episode of BTF! Though to be fair, it\u2019s nearly impossible to not get upstaged by Cardi B. Seinfeld is the perfect guest for BTF, as his public persona has only grown more cantankerous as the years pile on. Yes, this episode has the expected barbs traded back and forth about Bee Movie, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, and \u201cKramer\u2019s great stand-up bit.\u201d But the episode\u2019s highlight is a sweet moment between Seinfeld and Wayne Knight, best known as his sitcom nemesis Newman. When Seinfeld lambastes Galifianakis for having Knight show up in a \u201cclich\u00e9d, exploitative way,\u201d Knight meekly tells his former co-star, \u201cI thought that\u2019s what you wanted.\u201d I wonder how often in the last two decades has that conversation played out in Knight\u2019s mind for real?\n\n7. \u201cBradley Cooper\u201d (2009)\n\nReleased just days before The Hangover launched Galifianakis into an excruciating bout with fame, this episode with co-star Bradley Cooper reminds you why the first installment of the movie franchise was so winning despite it\u2019s fratty inclinations: chemistry! It\u2019s too bad Galifianakis is, you know, a brilliant artist with self-respect instead of a Hollywood stooge, because if he were the latter, there would already exist a buddy comedy with these two. But at least we\u2019ll always have Cooper\u2019s two heated episodes of BTF. This first one features an exchange that sums up the entire show. Cooper: \u201cWhy are you being mean to me?\u201d Galifianakis: \u201cI\u2019m not. Just asking questions.\u201d\n\n6. \u201cCharlize Theron\u201d (2009)\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of solid or gaseous states of matter, sorry, this ain\u2019t the episode for you. But if you\u2019re a big liquid head, dive right in! In this episode, Charlize Theron tears up while talking about her cancer-stricken dog, sensually describes the sweat dripping down her inner thigh, and almost breaks Galifianakis\u2019s brain by whispering her desire to jump into a pool. The fluids don\u2019t stop, as it ends with Theron pissing herself over the thought of a \u201cfat garden gnome\u201d like Galifianakis joining her in the deep end. Theron may be best known for prestige dramas and summer action blockbusters, but this episode proves she\u2019d be great top-lining a straight comedy\n\n5. \u201cJustin Bieber\u201d (2013)\n\nIn 2013, Justin Bieber had firmly exited his cute-as-a-button Tiger Beat\u2013cover model era but had not yet crisis-managed his way into his role as a man devoted both to Jesus Christ and singing the guest hooks on other artists\u2019 songs. Because in the year of Justin\u2019s Lord 2013, Bieber was firmly in the period that necessitated his current persona. I\u2019m talking about, of course, his bad-boy years. Remember those? In a two-year span, Bieber got a DUI, peed in a janitor\u2019s bucket, egged his neighbor\u2019s house, and wrote that Anne Frank would\u2019ve been a Belieber. This was a time when Bieber was a very easy target, but he takes Galifianakis\u2019s insults like a champ, even if it was because his PR handlers were just out of his eyeline. Galifianakis uses this episode as an opportunity to ask a question many people had been wondering for years: When he said Anne Frank would\u2019ve been a Belieber, did he mean an 80-year-old Anne Frank would be a fan? Or was Bieber positing a scenario where he can time-travel? And if it\u2019s the latter, would he kill baby Hitler or leave him alone because he\u2019d also be a Belieber? In other words: a truly excellent interview.\n\n4. \u201cConan O\u2019Brien & Andy Richter\u201d (2009)\n\nIt\u2019s always jarring to see a talk-show host interviewed by a peer. Why is James Corden on Stephen Colbert\u2019s set? What\u2019s David Letterman doing on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s couch? Are they going to fight?! It\u2019s doubly strange when a talk-show host is interviewed between two large vascular plants on a Dadaist web series. In what shouldn\u2019t come as a total surprise, Conan O\u2019Brien and longtime sidekick Andy Richter make for a classic episode of BTF filled with backhanded compliments, seething rage, and awkward intervals shot only a couple months into Conan\u2019s abbreviated Tonight Show run. The only detriment of the episode is an unwanted surprise appearance by Andy Dick. Unwanted Surprise With Andy Dick, huh? That sounds like both a failed Comedy Central talk-show pilot and the legal-troubles section of his Wikipedia page.\n\n3. \u201cPresident Barack Obama\u201d (2014)\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s BTF episode was astonishing for many reasons. But the biggest stunner was that it\u2019s reason for existing \u2014 to enroll young people in Obamacare after a disastrous two months when HealthCare.gov was basically inaccessible \u2014 surpassed all expectations. The White House said that traffic to the website increased by 40 percent in just one day, with most of that traffic surely coming from the young YouTube-watching Americans who were essential to propping up the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut the episode wouldn\u2019t be the second most-watched video on Funny or Die\u2019s YouTube account (sandwiched in between two Justin Bieber clips) if not for the jokes and the assured comedy styling of our nation\u2019s first black president. Sure, the \u201cWhat\u2019s it like to be the nation\u2019s last black president?\u201d and running for a third term would be \u201csorta like doing a third Hangover movie\u201d are the jokes everybody remembers. But I\u2019m partial to Galifianakis\u2019s bored remark after Obama implores viewers to sign up for health care: \u201cIs this what they mean by drones?\u201d\n\n2. \u201cSean Penn\u201d (2010)\n\nThe only episode to feature Galifianakis\u2019s affable twin alter ego Seth Galifianakis, this episode with Hollywood curmudgeon Sean Penn is also one of the shortest. And for good reason: Galifianakis revealed on David Letterman\u2019s My Next Guest Needs No Introduction that he believed Penn was legitimately angry with him. So Galifianakis abruptly walked over to director Scott Aukerman and told him the shoot was over. But it turns out that the two-time Oscar winner was just being good at the job that\u2019s earned him those two Oscars, as Galifianakis tells Letterman that they went out for a nice dinner later that evening. This episode may be truncated, but it\u2019s perfect the way it is.\n\n1. \u201cBen Stiller\u201d (2010)\n\nThere are several routes comedians can choose when playing themselves as fictionalized assholes. After more or less creating cringe comedy with bits like the Fridays incident, Andy Kaufman morphed into a literal wrestling heel who only fought women. Tim Heidecker\u2019s annoyed, pissy persona heard in early episodes of Comedy Bang! Bang! has slowly evolved with every new layer added to the On Cinema cosmos into a fully fleshed right-wing alternate-universe Tim. And then you have Ben Stiller, who has mastered the art of playing a singular pompous version of himself, dripping with disdain toward the people around him. Yes, Stiller is rightfully lauded for playing cartoonishly villainous characters in films like Heavyweights, Dodgeball, and Greenberg (I consider him that film\u2019s antagonist). But my favorite Stiller is when he, as himself, can\u2019t stop lording his arrogance over those around him in shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm and Extras, music videos like Puff Daddy\u2019s \u201cBad Boys for Life,\u201d and countless awards-show appearances.\n\nWatching Stiller go fern-to-fern with Galifianakis is like watching the LeBron versus Jordan fantasy matchup of NBA fans\u2019 dreams. It\u2019s two legends in complete control of contempt, trading passive-aggressive insults like two Wasps continuing a centuries-long dispute that was started by their great-great-grandfathers over a fountain pen. It\u2019s two men wanting to strangle each other with their eyes. It\u2019s Galifianakis referring to Stiller\u2019s most famous role as \u201cJewlander.\u201d You won\u2019t find more realistic scorn featured in these 22 episodes, and for that reason, this is the best episode of BTF.", "description": "In honor of the debut of Zach Galifianakis\u2019s \u201cBetween Two Ferns: The Movie\u201d on Netflix this Friday, we\u2019ve ranked all 22 episodes that have been released since 2008.", "authors": ["Pablo Goldstein"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/18/18-between-two-ferns-ranking-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
