Pulverising synth sounds, thunderous drumming and frantic keyboard arpeggios create a manic bubble gum-pop and power-metal hybrid explosion.\n\nBut from here, the duo really start to experiment with styles \u2013 with mixed results.\n\nVideo of BABYMETAL - Shanti Shanti Shanti (OFFICIAL)\n\nElevator Girl and Night Night Burn throw in some jazz piano breakdowns underneath old-skool pop-punk vocals. Meanwhile, In The Name Of and Pa Pa Ya merge gothic choirs and doomsday-sounding church bells with Cuban-inspired reggaeton beats.\n\nBut the group save the worst for back-to-back tracks Shanti Shanti Shanti and Oh Majinai, an accordion-heavy sea shanty which could only really be described as pirate-folk-metal.\n\nSaving graces include Kagerou and Starlight, while ultra-heavy metal closer Arkadia provides a dramatic ending.\n\nAll in all, Babymetal will really test your mettle with this one.", "description": "The duo's attempt to mix different styles and instruments - like reggaeton and accordions - falls flat", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/ea830ff8-efd1-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires170733.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
