This has added up to $75 billion each day in the banking system.\n\nOn Friday, the New York Fed, which implements the central bank\u2019s market actions, said it will conduct more repo operations into October in overnight and longer-term loans.\n\n\u201cQuarter-end is the issue. There is too much collateral out there that needs funding,\u201d said Steven Zeng, interest rates strategist at Deutsche Bank in New York. \u201cThe Fed is essentially helping to provide a funding backstop for those positions.\u201d\n\nRepo rates USONRP= hit 10% on Tuesday, propelling other short-term rates sharply higher. They were at 1.85%-1.95% early Friday afternoon.\n\n(GRAPHIC: U.S. repo rate - here)\n\nAnalysts blamed the repo swings on huge demand for cash to pay for quarterly corporate taxes and the prior week\u2019s $78 billion worth of coupon-bearing Treasury supply for the market ruction earlier this week.\n\nTreasury issuance will be a factor again as the quarter comes to a close: Monday, Sept. 30, will be the settlement date for $113 billion of Treasury notes that will be auctioned next week.\n\nAnalysts also said a decline of bank reserves contributed to the market\u2019s choppy behavior. They are down to about $1.4 trillion from $2.3 trillion in 2017 as the Fed has reduced its bond holdings.\n\nThe Fed jumped into action early on Tuesday, adding temporary cash on a large scale for the first time in more than a decade to calm jittery markets.\n\nThis move was on top of the Fed cutting the interest it pays banks on reserves and reverse repos on Wednesday.\n\nWhat alarmed the Fed on Tuesday, some analysts say, unlike recent episodes when repo rates spiked, was that there was a strong indication the borrowing cost in the federal funds market was rising above the top end of the central bank\u2019s target range, which was 2.00%-2.25% at the time.\n\nThe Fed targets the federal funds rate USFOMC=ECI to conduct monetary policy.\n\nIf this condition were to persist, it could stoke fears in markets that policymakers are losing control of short-term interest rates, analysts said.\n\nDallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told reporters after an event in Corpus Christi, Texas that the central bank \u201cshould be seriously examining plans to let the balance sheet increase with growth in the demand for reserves.\u201d\n\nUntil the Fed comes up with longer-term fixes such launching a standing repo facility and/or increasing purchases of Treasuries for its balance sheet growth, the central bank will likely keep up with these repo operations to fill gaps in daily funding, analysts said.\n\n\u201cFunding conditions are getting better,\u201d Zeng said. \u201cThis is the Fed being cautious.\u201d\n\n(GRAPHIC: U.S. primary dealers' Treasury holdings - here)", "description": "The Federal Reserve plans to keep pouring tens of billions of dollars a day into the U.S. banking system through early October in a bid to avert another market disruption as the end of the quarter approaches, a time when lending typically diminishes.", "authors": ["Richard Leong", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
