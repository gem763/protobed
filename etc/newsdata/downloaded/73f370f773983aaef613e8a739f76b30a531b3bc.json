See how he did in this video archive.\n\nBithell regaled me with the story of pitching the producers of perhaps the most third-person-shootery film franchise alive on, of all things, a tactics game. He discussed the involvement of the film\u2019s directors and stuntmen in the game\u2019s design process. He answered many of my questions about what Ian McShane is like.\n\nJohn Wick Hex struck me, the first time I played, as a perfectly cohesive work of game design. Every system supports every other system. So, naturally, I asked Bithell to walk me through the timeline of its development. It all started with what he calls a simple, no-frills clone of XCOM. Given that John Wick is a master gun-shooter and expert dude-killer, Bithell and his team found it a ridiculous proposition to have John Wick \u201clevel up.\u201d It would clearly be insulting to Keanu.\n\nSo rather than complicate their no-frills, one-guy XCOM with a rich skill tree or expanding moveset, they laser-focused on the logistics and repercussions of even the tiniest action. I wanted to know when the \u201cfocus\u201d metre and the \u201crefocus\u201d mechanic (which I call the \u201cdeep breath\u201d) entered the picture. We talked about Into the Breach. We discussed roughly 47 specific details per minute.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was the John Wick films\u2019 director \u2014 former Keanu Reeves stuntman Chad Stahelski \u2014 who suggested the game\u2019s unique, dynamic approach to fog of war. (And he did it without even knowing what 'fog of war' was.)\n\nBased on the chapters I\u2019ve played so far, John Wick Hex is both a great work of design and a great video game. Before meeting and talking to Bithell, I had massive respect for what I perceived as the result of a wildly complicated series of design decisions. After meeting its director, I still had that massive respect, though I also had obtained audio of him telling the world his game is \u201cExactly like the Goose Game[...].\u201d\n\n(Watch the video for the full details on that \u201c[...].\u201d Spoiler: It\u2019s a dumb joke, and it\u2019s my fault.)\n\nAlso, as of October 8th, 2019, I now possess just one degree of separation from Ian McShane. Dad, if you\u2019re reading this: Yes, yesterday I talked to a guy who has met Ian McShane. I\u2019ll have you a signed Deadwood Blu-Ray box by Christmas 2023, at this rate.\n\nBy the way, if you personally liked, commented, and / or subscribed to our YouTube channel, that would definitely fuel my habit of making a lot more videos like this. I promise you might love it.", "description": "Yesterday I invited John Wick Hex director Mike Bithell to come into Kotaku headquarters\u2019 streaming studio, where he answered my increasingly specific questions about his difficult game while playing its hardest difficulty setting.
