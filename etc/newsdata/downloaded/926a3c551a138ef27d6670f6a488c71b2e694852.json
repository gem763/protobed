Supplied\n\nAs a November 7 vote on the takeover offer fast approaches, majority shareholder Hume Partners \u2013 formally Taverners Group \u2013 has upped its stake in the property trust from 6.65 per cent to 7.88 per cent.\n\nThe $10 million increase, revealed in an ASX announcement lodged on Friday, would've been alarming news for hedge fund owners that have piled into the stock on the expectation the vote would proceed with ease.\n\nHistory tells us that when such a shareholder increases their stake before a scheme vote they are normally buying more shares to vote no, not to vote yes. And such a deal needs three-quarters of shares cast at the meeting to be successful.\n\nHume Partners is run by Ross Burney, who did not return Street Talk's calls on Monday.", "description": "One of the Australian Unity Office Fund's largest shareholders could refuse to go quietly in the takeover process.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.5936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_913/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b1cb08ebbbbdbb14ba8d05c224d959931d49c8d6", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
