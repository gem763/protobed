More than 100 protesters are also expected to camp in Carlton Gardens each night this week to prompt government action on climate change.\n\nAccording to Commander Tim Hansen of the north-west metropolitan police unit said the force will be closely monitoring crowd behaviour throughout the week.\n\nThe Spring Rebellion protests will take place all across the globe this week, with Melbourne protesters planning multiple peaceful disruptions across the city.\n\nYou can expect protests at RMIT on Swanston St, Alexandra Gardens and Batman Park as well as a string of other protests that will pop up at undisclosed locations across the city over the week. The unannounced protests aim to create maximum disruption to the public in an attempt to raise awareness for the issue of climate change.\n\n\u2018\u2018Everyone has a right to protest peacefully without impacting the rest of the community, who also have the right to go about their daily business,\u2019\u2019 Commander Tim Hansen said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Transport has also warned that some tram services, particularly those in the CBD will likely be affected by the protests planned throughout the week.\n\n\u2018\u2018Tram passengers travelling in the CBD or Carlton area this week should allow extra time and check the PTV website or smartphone app to get the latest travel advice.\u201d\n\nSo far, there\u2019s a \u201cswarm for survival\u201d planned for Wednesday before an \u201cextinction rave\u201d on Friday night and the \u201cnudie parade\u201d that\u2019s scheduled for Saturday.\n\nCommander Tim Hansen and event organisers have both warned that arrests are expected throughout the week.\n\n\u201cAnyone coming to an event in Melbourne looking to disrupt others or create conflict and incite violence can expect a firm response from police,\u201d Hansen said.\n\nHowever, many members of the Extinction Rebellion are willing to be arrested in order to spread their message.\n\n\u201cBusiness as usual is ecological and climate disruption. Business as usual is mass extinction, famine, and drought. So it\u2019s time to disrupt business as usual and fight for our survival,\u201d a statement on their Facebook page reads.", "description": "Extinction Rebellion protests are ramping up across Melbourne's CBD this week for the 'Spring Rebellion' global movement.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1172677867.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
