I feel so bad I\u2019ve let Nadiya down in a sense. I\u2019ve enjoyed it but I\u2019ve put some weight on though.\"\n\nSending out an emotional message to his co-stars while discussing his highlights, David added: \"Having the best partner and the guys up there. Everyone\u2019s lovely.\n\n\"Just a word to Will: I think I work hard, but, man, that guy puts a shift in.\"\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nThis came after the Paralympic gold medalist, who was born with Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita or AMC (curvature of the limbs), left almost everyone in the studio in tears with his moving performance.\n\nPraising her partner, Nadiya said: \"He\u2019s done so well. I\u2019m so proud of you.\n\n\"From the first day he couldn\u2019t lift his elbows up or stand straight and now he\u2019s delivered such an amazing jive. I\u2019m so proud.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nCraig Revel Horwood admitted that neither of the couples were technically sound but decided to save Mike.\n\nHe said: \"Well for me both couples were pretty much technically equal but the couple who I\u2019d like to save were the most confident performers and that was Mike And Katya.\"\n\nMotsi Mabuse, who also chose to save Mike, said: \"Well I felt that one couple gave me a better performance than I saw the first time so I\u2019m going to save Mike and Katya.\u201d\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nSpecial guest judge Alfonso Ribeiro, who was standing in for Bruno Tonioli, put the final nail in the coffin.\n\nThe Fresh Prince Of Bel Air star said: \"The couple who I\u2019m going to save put on a great show. The technique wasn\u2019t there but they came out and delivered a showstopper for the audience to love so I\u2019m going to save Mike And Katya.\"\n\nHead judge Shirley Ballas agreed with her fellow judges and revealed she would have also chosen to save Mike and Katya.\n\n*Strictly Come Dancing air Saturdays and Sundays on BBC One", "description": "Former footballer David James and his professional partner Nadiya Bychkova were sent home after a tense dance-off", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Bbc Guy Levy", "Bbc", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20660875.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EMB-19102263-high_res-strictly-come-dancing-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
