And many of the victims are journalists who got the word out.\u201d\n\nQuick guide 10 key films at the Venice film festival Show Hide The Truth\n\nVenice\u2019s opening night spot goes to the latest film by Hirokazu Kore-eda, whose Shoplifters won top prize at Cannes last year. Catherine Deneuve plays an ailing French star who returns home for a tricky reconciliation with daughter Juliette Binoche, accompanied by her husband (Ethan Hawke) and young child. Joker\n\nJoaquin Phoenix is the cracked aspirant comedian in this drama from Todd Philips that\u2019s reportedly 80% King of Comedy to 20% The Dark Knight. Robert De Niro co-stars in what could well be the first comic book movie to bag a best picture Oscar. Marriage Story\n\nNoah Baumbach\u2019s latest is the story of a cross-coastal divorce starring Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson. Like his most recent film, The Meyerowitz Stories, this has been bankrolled by Netflix. Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta co-star as loved ones \u2013 and lawyers. The King\n\nMan of the moment Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is Henry V in this lush, tough Shakespeare adaptation from David Mich\u00f4d. Ben Mendelsohn is Henry\u2019s father; Robert Pattinson, Joel Edgerton and Chalamet\u2019s girlfriend, Lily-Rose Depp, offer support. The Laundromat\n\nMeryl Streep leads Steven Soderbergh\u2019s fictionalised take on the Panama Papers leak. Streep and Soderbergh are sailing to Europe on the Queen Mary 2, shooting another feature en route. Seberg\n\nKristen Stewart plays Jean Seberg in this biopic focusing on the actor\u2019s years as an FBI target on account of her support for the Black Panther party \u2013 taking a role which Stewart\u2019s mentor, Jodie Foster, first considered playing in 1991. An Officer and a Spy\n\nA controversial slice of history \u2013 the Dreyfus affair \u2013 is brought to the big screen by a controversial director: Roman Polanski. Starring Jean Dujardin, it is based on the book by Robert Harris. The Perfect Candidate\n\nSaudi Arabian director Haifaa Al-Mansour \u2013 one of only two women with films in competition \u2013 returns after the success of 2012\u2019s Wadjda with the tale of a young doctor who makes a bid for office in a municipal election. Ad Astra\n\nBrad Pitt follows in the footsteps of Sandra Bullock, Ryan Gosling and Matt Damon by heading into space in search of awards. James Gray\u2019s drama will be a major player at Venice; Liv Tyler, Tommy Lee Jones and Ruth Negga co-star. American Skin\n\nNate Parker\u2019s slavery epic Birth of a Nation won raves in 2016 before allegations of sexual misconduct by Parker took the shine off considerably. His belated return is a revenge drama about a janitor whose son is killed by a police officer.\n\nStreep singled out Daphne Caruana Galizia, the Maltese investigative reporter who was killed by a car bomb outside her home in 2017. \u201cPeople died and people die still to get the word out. This movie is fun and it\u2019s funny but it\u2019s really, really, really important.\u201d\n\nAsked about her character\u2019s motivation in her search for answers, Streep said: \u201cGrief is a great motivator. The parents of the children shot at Parkland high school, the parents of the children shot at Newtown, Connecticut \u2013 those people don\u2019t stop; they don\u2019t stop in trying to change the world. If it\u2019s personal, you don\u2019t stop, and we rely on those people, for whom it really counts, to save us all.\u201d\n\nStreep and Soderbergh arrived in Europe a few days before the premiere on the Queen Mary 2, the ocean liner on which most of their next film, Let Them All Talk, was shot.\n\nCiting Dr Strangelove \u2013 Kubrick\u2019s satire about the nuclear arms race \u2013 as inspiration for The Laundromat\u2019s tone, Soderbergh said he felt \u201ca dark comedy would have the best possible chance of remaining in the minds of the viewers and also gave us the opportunity to use the complexity of these kind of financial activities almost as a joke, almost as a setup for a punchline. Otherwise viewers would feel as if they were being educated as opposed to entertained.\u201d\n\nThe director praised the UK for recently enacting legislation \u2013 in the form of unexplained wealth orders \u2013 to identify and potentially investigate people purchasing UK assets with \u201cextreme wealth that seems to have come from nowhere\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a really interesting way to attack this. There\u2019s no universe in which that legislation would be enacted in the US. Which begs the question: why would you be against this?\u201d\n\nDespite Streep being a vocal critic of Donald Trump, none of the panel named the current White House administration, but Soderbergh alluded to a heightened relationship between such financial scams and climate change. He then cited figures suggesting that about 50 of the world\u2019s richest people now hold the same wealth as the poorest half of the world\u2019s population. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem to me to be a sustainable paradigm, and I think transparency is the only solution.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very troubling time,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut speaking about it is the beginning. You can get people wondering on a day-to-day basis: how am I participating in this?\u201d\n\nJake Bernstein, on whose nonfiction book Secrecy World the film is loosely based, exploded the common misapprehension that tax havens are \u201cwarm and sunny and have palm trees. One of the the biggest tax havens is the United States of America.\u201d\n\nBernstein claimed that anonymous shell companies make over $1bn (\u00a3822m) a year in Delaware, monies which may be funding shady enterprises in other parts of the world. \u201cIt\u2019s about raising awareness and having people demand better of their government and their public servants.\u201d\n\nOldman said he hoped the film\u2019s release model \u2013 its distributor is streaming giant Netflix \u2013 would aid its chances of having a real-world impact. \u201cYou\u2019ve got something this serious and you wanna get that out to as many people. Can art bring about change? Yeah \u2013 if people see it. And this movie will reach a lot of people.\u201d\n\nStreep, fresh from success on the second season of HBO series Big Little Lies, reiterated her personal preference for cinema over TV. \u201cI\u2019d rather see it big. But the kids these days, they don\u2019t care.\u201d", "description": "Ahead of the Venice premiere of The Laundromat, actor pays tribute to murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia", "authors": ["Catherine Shoard"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/686c9e461603f9f07abf822118568663f548b44a/0_322_4836_2902/master/4836.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f9eeb4b2c57b837002ce8fc2ebc35176"}
