(It slows down the flow at rush hour.) According to a recent Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) report, all the walkers are breaking escalators faster. The Otis Elevator Company even says that walking on the escalator is a safety hazard. But that\u2019s not what we\u2019re here to talk about. We\u2019re here because of a dumbfounding revelation from Otis.\n\nWhy You Should Always Walk On Escalators On Tuesday, The New York Times decided to reignite the age old debate of walking versus standing on escalators. And do you know what the paper concluded? \"You shouldn't walk on escalators.\" This is a patently incorrect conclusion for at least four reasons. Read more\n\nAccording to the CBC:\n\nOtis, a manufacturer of escalators (and the trademark owner of the word escalator) actually recommends users stand in the middle of the escalator with hands on both railings for maximum safety.\ufeff\n\nWhen asked for comment, an Otis rep confirmed that the company discourages walking on the escalator, and that riders should \u201cstep on, hold on to the rail and stay alert.\u201d The 22 safety recommendations listed on Otis\u2019s website include \u201cstand in the centre of the step and face forward,\u201d but they do not mention double-fisting the handrails.\n\nBut just to be safe, we illustrated Otis\u2019s utopian vision for a safely escalated world.\n\nIllustration: Benjamin Currie\n\nHere are some things the Otis safety page does explicitly advise:\n\nDon\u2019t use a stopped escalator as stairs (sorry Mitch Hedberg)\n\nNo leaning\n\nNo canes\n\nDon\u2019t sit\n\n\u201cTake extra care if you are wearing bifocals\u201d\n\n\u201cHold children firmly with one hand\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep loose clothing clear of steps and sides\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t stand at the top or bottom of the damn escalator like it\u2019s your living room\n\nThere really is a small risk to escalator walking: As the CBC points out, in the U.S. about 10,000 people get injured on an escalator each year. And one Tokyo study blamed walking for a decent portion of Tokyo\u2019s escalator injuries.\n\nMuch as I\u2019d love to manipulate these stats to make everyone behave the way I\u2019d like you to, it is obviously not particularly dangerous \u2014 just pointless \u2014 to walk up a normal escalator. But one injury firm connects the dots: Escalators can malfunction, so badly that people die. And when an escalator breaks, all these paranoid safety precautions can suddenly make a difference.\n\nLife is about weighing risk, and the risk is pretty low that you\u2019ll be the one to fall through a missing escalator step. But sometimes, someone does, and if you\u2019re sprinting up the magical moving staircase every day, you are buying a few more lottery tickets for that particular prize. I\u2019m not saying you should death-grip the handrail. But watch your step, yeah?", "description": "People shouldn\u2019t walk on escalators. (It slows down the flow at rush hour.)
