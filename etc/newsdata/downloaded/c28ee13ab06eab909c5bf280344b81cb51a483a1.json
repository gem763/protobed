Partly it\u2019s because those troops, who had been tasked with fighting ISIS in Syria, might be needed to \u2026 fight ISIS in Syria.\n\nThat is, the event that triggered U.S. withdrawal from the country \u2014 Turkey\u2019s onslaught against the Kurds \u2014 may destabilize northern Syria to the point where U.S. troops are forced to re-enter sooner rather than later. The difference being that ISIS will have had time amid the chaos of Turkey\u2019s incursion to gather strength before American soldiers have to deal with them again.\n\nEsper said the troops going into Iraq will have two missions. \u201cOne is to help defend Iraq and two is to perform a counter-ISIS mission as we sort through the next steps,\u201d he said. \u201cThings could change between now and whenever we complete the withdrawal, but that\u2019s the game plan right now.\u201d\u2026 Esper said he will talk with other allies at a NATO meeting in the coming week to discuss the way ahead for the counter-IS mission. Asked if U.S. special operations forces will conduct unilateral military operations into Syria to go after IS, Esper said that is an option that will be discussed with allies over time.\n\nThe \u201cendless war\u201d isn\u2019t ending. We\u2019re just going to fight it from a less advantageous position, with our key ally either evacuated or decimated in the zone of likely future combat.\n\nTrump tweeted about this earlier and appears to have quoted Esper on something he never said:\n\nI\u2019m not sure who Trump is referring to, but I\u2019m travelling with Defense Secretary Esper and cant recall the quote Trump is using. While speaking with us Enroute to Afghanistan, Esper also made no mention of new areas being resettled with Kurds or oil. pic.twitter.com/VAN9IQ13At \u2014 Idrees Ali (@idreesali114) October 20, 2019\n\nThat tweet was deleted due to his misspelling of Esper\u2019s name, which was almost certainly an autocorrect snafu on his phone. The revised tweet is almost as strange, though:\n\n\u201cThe ceasefire is holding up very nicely. There are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. New areas being resettled with Kurds. U.S. soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zone. We have secured the Oil.\u201d Mark Esper, Secretary of Defense. Ending endless wars! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2019\n\nFrom what I can tell, Esper never said most of that. He did tell reporters that the ceasefire \u201cgenerally seems to be holding,\u201d according to the AP, but the rest is a Trumpian hash. He\u2019s not \u201cending endless wars,\u201d as I just noted. If anything, he\u2019s extended the one in Syria and our potential involvement in it by giving ISIS a chance to break out. No one seems to know what he\u2019s talking about when he mentions securing \u201cthe oil\u201d either. He made that point a few days ago as well (\u201cWe\u2019ve taken control of the oil in the Middle East\u201d) and the media\u2019s been scratching its head over it ever since. Presumably he means that troops haven\u2019t withdrawn from Syrian oil fields that were already occupied by American and Kurdish forces.\n\nAs for the Kurds being \u201cresettled,\u201d that\u2019s the politest possible way to describe Erdogan\u2019s plan to have them ethnically cleansed from the area so that he can start dumping Syrian refugees currently living in Turkey back across the border.\n\nRepublican voters are still with the president on this matter, by and large, although not by the usual 85-90 percent margins one tends to see from GOP voters on Trump initiatives. Support on the right for withdrawal from Syria in polling over the past week has ranged from low-majority numbers (mid-50s) to mere pluralities in favor, and one poll found 44 percent of Republicans agreeing with the statement that retreating from northern Syria while the Kurds are under fire from Turkey is damaging America\u2019s reputation as a trusted ally.\n\nTrump\u2019s best asset in repelling political attacks is the universally shared perception that the U.S. has never had good options in Syria and thus criticism of any particular decision to deploy or to retreat can seem opportunistic. For instance, here\u2019s staunch libertarian Justin Amash insisting that U.S. troops never should have been in Syria (because there was never an AUMF passed by Congress) and certainly should have been withdrawn before now \u2014 and yet he criticizes Trump for not trying to reach a deal with Erdogan before the Turks invaded, the catalyst for Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the area. That\u2019s not strictly contradictory, I suppose, but \u201cWithdraw! Wait, no, not yet!\u201d is a hard argument to make, and comes off as a longtime antagonist dinging Trump just to ding him. Then again, the libertarian alternative to Amash is Rand Paul, who went so far as to call in 2015 for giving the Kurds their own independent state if they agreed to lead the fight against ISIS and, now that they have, has spent the last 10 days cheerleading America\u2019s betrayal of them seemingly without a care. At least Amash is worried about what comes next with ISIS.", "description": "End endless wars?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/u.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
