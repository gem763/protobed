Bush, has come out in support of the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI do think that an impeachment inquiry is warranted,\u201d Card said during an appearance Monday on MSNBC. \u201cClearly lines have been crossed.\u201d\n\nCard, who also served as Transportation Secretary during George H.W. Bush\u2019s presidency, said he\u2019s not sure yet whether Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine amount to an impeachable offense.\n\n\u201cI want people to calm down, take a look at it, don\u2019t call a molehill a mountain,\u201d he said, suggesting Democrats were drawing conclusions prematurely. \u201cThis is a serious process. ... I do want the impeachment process, if it\u2019s going to go forward, to be done deliberately, without hyperbole.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry last month after a whistleblower report filed by a U.S. intelligence official surfaced. In the complaint, the whistleblower alleged Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary race.\n\nThe whistleblower, whose identity hasn\u2019t been released to the public, accused Trump of seeking foreign assistance to help his reelection campaign and possibly using American aid to Ukraine as leverage.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing and said his phone call with Zelensky was \u201cperfect.\u201d", "description": "\"Clearly lines have been crossed,\" said Andrew Card, who served during George W.
