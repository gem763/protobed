Youtube 8/25 18. Britney and Madonna kiss at the VMAs (2003) An obvious and bizarre publicity stunt, but this split-second snog at the MTV VMAs is surely the most famous same-sex kiss of all time. Getty 9/25 17. The Golden Girls tackle gay marriage (1991) Our beloved Miami foursome weren\u2019t just camp icons \u2013 they were ardent LGBT allies.

Queer As Folk (1999) Russel T Davies\u2019s groundbreaking Channel 4 series was unapologetic in its portrayal of gay men and their sex lives, and taught a pearl-clutching British public about rimming.

Getty Images 15/25 11. Modern Family (2009) One of the most successful TV shows in the world, Modern Family succeeded in portraying Mitchell and Cameron as parents just as capable of raising (and embarrassing) their daughter as any straight couple. 20th Television 16/25 10. Boy George on Top of the Pops (1982) When Culture Club appeared on Top of the Pops to perform \u201cDo You Really Want To Hurt Me?\u201d, the androgynous look of its colourful frontman threw viewers and the UK tabloids into a spin. BBC 17/25 9. Lady Gaga - \u201cBorn This Way\u201d (2011) Lady Gaga\u2019s love of the LGBT community, and her status as \"Mother Monster\" for all outcasts, was brilliantly channelled into this mainstream dance hit.

George Michael - Outside (1998) Six months after being spectacularly outed after an incident in a Los Angeles public toilet, George Michael decided to own it, with this number one single, complete with an outrageously tongue-in-cheek video about cruising. Jaw-dropping to this day. Youtube 20/25 6. Glee (2009) Glee presented high-camp musical numbers and wacky plot lines alongside some of the first openly gay and transgender characters seen within a high school setting.

Focus/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock 22/25 4. Queen at Live Aid (1985) Freddie Mercury wasn\u2019t open about his sexuality when he stole the show at Live Aid, but he was unmistakably one of our own. His 20-minute tour de force in front of two billion TV viewers goes down in history as the greatest rock performance of all time. Alamy Stock Photo 23/25 3. Philadelphia (1993) The first mainstream film to portray the HIV/Aids crisis was built on a haunting performance from Tom Hanks and brought an understanding of the issue to millions of cinemagoers. Rex Features 24/25 2. RuPaul's Drag Race (2009) The show that launched a thousand memes. RuPaul\u2019s incredible popularity is a testament to how widely the show reached out beyond the LGBT community and into the wider public, who have been duly educated about drag culture and the courage of those who take part. Getty Images 25/25 1. Will and Grace (1998) Will and Grace was the first time a sitcom put gay characters front and centre, and delighted audiences with its razor-sharp wit.
