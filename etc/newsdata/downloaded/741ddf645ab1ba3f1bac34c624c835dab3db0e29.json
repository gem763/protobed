She said the allegations that she was disloyal to Mr. Trump, circulated by allies of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, were totally \u201cfictitious.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats try to protect their witnesses.\n\nThe House Democratic committee chairmen leading the impeachment inquiry know that any witnesses who defy the president\u2019s order not to cooperate risk retaliation, even the loss of their jobs. So they announced witnesses like Ms. Yovanovitch have no choice but to cooperate.\n\nRepresentatives Adam B. Schiff of California, Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, and Eliot L. Engel of New York said on Friday that the State Department on Thursday tried to block the appearance of Ms. Yovanovitch, so the committees issued a subpoena Friday morning.\n\n\u201cThis duly authorized subpoena is mandatory, and the illegitimate order from the Trump Administration not to cooperate has no force. As is required of her, the Ambassador is now complying,\u201d they said in a joint statement Friday afternoon.\n\nThey continued:\n\n\u201cAny efforts by Trump Administration officials to prevent witness cooperation with the Committees will be deemed obstruction of a coequal branch of government and an adverse inference may be drawn against the President on the underlying allegations of corruption and cover-up.\u201d\n\nIn judge\u2019s dissent, did a Trump appointee bolster impeachment?\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2-1 on Friday against the White House\u2019s effort to crush an effort by House Democrats to extract Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns from his accounting firm, Mazars USA.\n\nThat had nothing to do with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, but the dissenter, a Trump appointee, Judge Neomi Rao, raised it, saying that the House\u2019s efforts were clearly looking for illegality and therefore those efforts should be done through an impeachment inquiry.", "description": "The former American ambassador to Ukraine delivered a scathing takedown of the Trump administration\u2019s conduct of foreign policy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/us/politics/11dc-impeachbriefing/11dc-impeachbriefing-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
