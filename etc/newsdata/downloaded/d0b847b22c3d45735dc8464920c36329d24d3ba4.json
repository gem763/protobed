In January, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism proposed a Long March cultural park as well.\n\nThe recent central meeting points out that construction of the three national cultural parks should be integrated with land space planning and stick to the principles of protection and inheritance first. All kinds of cultural relics and the surrounding environment will be strictly protected and managed, in order to protect the ecology and traditional culture.\n\nAs the Great Wall and Grand Canal are both trans-provincial key cultural protection projects, which require coordination among different departments, cooperation and joint management, experts suggest the central authorities build a sound coordination and negotiation mechanism to deal with the national cultural park projects well.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201908/02/5d43813ca310cf3e9794f63f.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-08-02"}
