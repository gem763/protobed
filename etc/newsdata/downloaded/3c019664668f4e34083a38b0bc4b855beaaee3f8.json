They had strong preset views on this subject,\u201d the minister argued.\n\nIn many ways, they did not present a fair picture. Maybe they did not absorb a fair picture either.\n\nJaishankar did not cite any concrete examples of the coverage he thought was unfair.\n\nAlso on rt.com Clashes along Kashmir border as India claims 2 soldiers & 1 civilian killed in Pakistani attack\n\nThe international media have reported on instances of human rights violations in the Indian-controlled part of disputed Kashmir after New Delhi revoked the area\u2019s decades-old self-governing status in early August. The decision was followed by imposing a communication lockdown and curfew-like restrictions in Kashmir.\n\nIndia denied violating the human rights of Kashmiris, saying that the restrictions were introduced to maintain law and order, and will be gradually lifted once the situation on the ground becomes less dangerous.\n\nIndia\u2019s neighbor Pakistan, which claims the whole of Kashmir as its territory, meanwhile, says that revoking the region\u2019s autonomy violated international law and has warned that it would lead to widespread violence. Indian officials claim the step was necessary to fight Islamist insurgents there, and will boost the region\u2019s economy.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
