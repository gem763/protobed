It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election,\u201d the chair\u2019s original message read.\n\nIs this thing on? \ud83c\udf99 https://t.co/K6phZRex8k \u2014 Ellen L Weintraub (@EllenLWeintraub) October 3, 2019\n\n\u201cThis is not a novel concept,\u201d the original post continued. \u201cElectoral intervention from foreign governments has been considered unacceptable since the beginnings of our nation. Our Founding Fathers ... knew that when foreign governments seek to influence American politics, it is always to advance their own interests, not America\u2019s.\u201d\n\nWeintraub was prompted to post that reminder in June after Trump told ABC News that he would consider accepting information on a political rival from a foreign national and dismissed the idea that such an act would constitute foreign interference in a U.S. election. The Mueller report, released earlier in the year, outlined Russian interference in the 2016 election along with 10 instances in which Trump may have sought to obstruct the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nNow, the president has apparently become bolder than ever.\n\nDespite White House officials\u2019 alleged efforts to cover up a July conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2015 in which the U.S. leader asked his Ukrainian counterpart to dig up dirt on Biden \u2015 Trump solicited help from another foreign country before news cameras on Thursday.\n\nHe did so even as the House is conducting an impeachment inquiry centered on Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky, which came to light in a whistleblower complaint.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe president is thought to view Biden as his chief rival in the 2020 election.", "description": "President Trump publicly called on Ukraine and China to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d961a0a2200007d03dccc2c.jpeg?cache=nv2hlfe5x9&ops=1778_1000"}
