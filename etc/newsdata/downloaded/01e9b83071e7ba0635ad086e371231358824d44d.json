That definition defines a family pass as consisting of a group of three or more members residing at the same residence, with at least one parent, and children under 18 or full-time students.\n\n\"The classification of a family pass at Marble Mountain is comparable to various other ski hills in Atlantic Canada,\" said the statement, which did not have a name attached to the comment.\n\nDawn Leja of Corner Brook went public after she bought the family passes online for her and her son, only for Marble to later tell her purchase didn't qualify for the discount and she would have to spend an extra $150 for the two of them to purchase individual passes for the upcoming ski season. Leja said Marble should reword the rate to call it a group rate, or expand its definition of \"family.\"\n\nMarble's statement did not address those concerns.\n\nFlexible definitions\n\nThe statement cited White Hills in Clarenville, as well as New Brunswick's Crabbe Mountain and Nova Scotia's Ski Wentworth, as offering similar passes.\n\nDawn Leja and her son take a picture at the top of Marble Mountain. Leja says since she already paid for a family pass rate, she would like it honoured by the resort. (Submitted by Dawn Leja)\n\nThe family passes at those ski resorts all require at least three members to qualify. But to purchase one adult pass and a child pass at White Hills, as Leja sought to do, is cheaper than its bundled family pass. Marble Mountain's pricing system, however, separates individual passes for sale at the family rate.\n\nFurther west, large resorts like Quebec's Mont Tremblant and Ontario's Blue Mountain offer only individual passes at various rates, while Mont-Saint-Anne, near Quebec City, offers family passes in a variety of formats, including one adult and one child.\n\nThe YMCA in St. John's is also flexible in its definition of a family pass, as including at least one adult and dependant child, with prices discounted based on the number of members.\n\nMarble's statement came after CBC was initially told the resort had no comment on the matter, as it was being referred to the provincial government.\n\nThe province owns Marble Mountain and operates it through the Marble Mountain Development Corporation, an entity that originally comprised community members and civil servants, but since mid-2017 has been operating solely under provincial government staff.\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "description": "The ski resort is sticking by its family pass rules, despite a single mom complaining it's discriminatory.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4968544.1546890159!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/marble-monday-skiing.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
