Colleagues inside the State Department and their allies in the broader foreign policy community are quietly hailing them as heroes, with special praise for those testifying despite still being on the government payroll.\n\nIn their testimonies, the diplomats have described being sidelined on Ukraine policy as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and other Trump political appointees \u2014 apparently at the president\u2019s direction \u2014 pursued a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy that included withholding some $400 million in military aid to Kyiv. Their boss, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has attacked the House process as \u201ctroubling\u201d and defended the legitimacy of Giuliani\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cImagine the uproar if any senior U.S. official, let alone the secretary of State, made a public speech and then put out the remarks via official U.S. government channels titled \u2018Being a Buddhist Leader.\u2019\" \u2014 U.S. diplomat\n\nOverall, the diplomats\u2019 testimony has bolstered allegations that Trump tried to improperly pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival. But some also used the platform to air long-held grievances over Trump and his aides\u2019 treatment of the State Department\u2019s career staffers, several of whom were demoted or sidelined following attacks by the conservative media.\n\nThe defiance has risks: that it will deepen the rift between Trump and the State Department while fueling more global confusion over U.S. foreign policy positions. Many of Trump\u2019s top aides view Foggy Bottom as a den of Democratic intrigue \u2014 a long- and widely held suspicion on the right with roots in the Cold War.\n\nFor now, though, it feels pretty good to hit back.\n\n\u201cPeople are fed up,\u201d said Laura Kennedy, a former U.S. ambassador who remains in touch with officials still in the State Department. \u201cThere\u2019s a deep well of resentment that\u2019s just bubbled toward the top.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also anxiety.\n\nServing diplomats say the impeachment inquiry has become a constant source of questions from their foreign counterparts and overseas press, and that it\u2019s a challenging issue to explain, especially given the State Department\u2019s role.\n\nFormer officials say they\u2019re fielding calls from still-serving diplomats worried about their futures. The possibility that the impeachment inquiry could rope in junior diplomats, or grow beyond Ukraine and Europe, isn\u2019t far from people\u2019s minds. A private Facebook group for Foreign Service officers considering quitting their jobs has seen a significant jump in participants.\n\n\u201cLower-level people are still terrified they\u2019ll be wrapped up in this,\u201d a former State official said. \u201cThey\u2019re glad to see Masha, Mike and George wave the flag for the Foreign Service but still not convinced people won\u2019t get screwed.\u201d\n\n\u201cMasha\u201d is a reference to Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who gave a deposition to lawmakers on Oct. 11 under subpoena from the investigating House committees and despite State Department objections. Her opening statement decried Trump\u2019s machinations on Ukraine while calling for more support for the Foreign Service.\n\nYovanovitch was recalled from Ukraine in May, a few months before her tenure was up, after Trump allies spread rumors that she was biased against the president. In a July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s leader that\u2019s at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, Trump called her \u201cbad news\u201d and said she was \u201cgoing to go through some things.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch told lawmakers that, in her 30-plus years as a diplomat, she always stuck to the required ethos of non-partisanship. So she was \u201cincredulous\u201d at being recalled over \u201cfalse claims.\u201d She warned that the State Department is being \u201cattacked and hollowed out from within\u201d and stressed that the repercussions go beyond Foggy Bottom.\n\nThe harm will also \u201ccome when those diplomats who soldier on and do their best to represent our nation face partners abroad who question whether the ambassador truly speaks for the president and can be counted upon as a reliable partner,\u201d she said in her opening statement.\n\nYovanovitch was followed on Capitol Hill by two other prominent career Foreign Service officers: George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary whose portfolio includes Ukraine; and Michael McKinley, who just days ago resigned as a senior adviser to Pompeo. Three other State Department officials \u2014 Bill Taylor, now the top U.S. diplomat in Kyiv; Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs; and Suriya Jayanti, a Foreign Service officer based in Kyiv \u2014 have been summoned to testify; others could follow.\n\nKent described being told by a superior to \u201clay low\u201d on Ukraine policy as Giuliani, the politically appointed U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and others allegedly ignored established diplomatic paths to pursue questionable interests in Ukraine.\n\nMcKinley told impeachment investigators that he resigned in part because of Trump\u2019s attacks on Yovanovitch and Pompeo\u2019s seeming unwillingness to protect career diplomats from political retaliation. McKinley had grown to find the situation \u201cunbearable,\u201d a former colleague told POLITICO.\n\nLike Yovanovitch, Kent testified in defiance of instructions from the White House and Pompeo. Both remain on the State Department payroll.\n\nHill staffers have indicated that they subpoenaed the diplomats to give them some cover so they could cooperate. McKinley, having resigned from State, testified voluntarily.\n\nA current State official said that, within the department, Yovanovitch and Kent in particular are being viewed with \u201cstrong respect and sympathy.\u201d They are seen as \u201ccareer public servants who became collateral damage in political issues,\u201d the staffer said, adding that there\u2019s a \u201cpretty long line of them in this administration.\u201d\n\nMcKinley, too, is viewed in positive terms for testifying, but many career staffers are wondering why it took him so long to resign \u2014 Yovanovitch was, after all, recalled around five months ago.\n\nNeither the State Department nor the White House responded to a request for comment on this story. On Thursday, however, Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, took a shot at the diplomats who testified, calling them \u201ccareer bureaucrats who are saying, \u2018You know what? I don\u2019t like President Trump\u2019s politics so I\u2019m going to participate in this witch hunt.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we all leave when it gets hard, who will be left to champion American diplomacy?\u201d \u2014 Elizabeth Fitzsimmons, deputy assistant secretary of State\n\nAlso testifying this month were Sondland, a Trump donor who was named an ambassador despite no diplomatic experience; and Kurt Volker, a former Foreign Service officer who took on an unpaid political appointment as a special U.S. envoy tasked with shepherding peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. Volker quit the position before testifying.\n\nThe inquiry\u2019s revelations have alarmed even the most diplomatic of diplomats.\n\nIn a furious essay in Foreign Affairs, William Burns, a highly regarded and famously measured Foreign Service veteran who now leads the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, turned heads in Washington when he compared Trump\u2019s treatment of U.S. diplomats to the days of communist-hunting led by Joseph McCarthy.\n\n\u201cThe damage from this assault \u2014 coming from within the executive branch itself, after nearly three years of unceasing diplomatic self-sabotage, and at a particularly fragile geopolitical moment \u2014 will likely prove to be even more severe to both diplomatic tradecraft and U.S. foreign policy,\u201d Burns warned in the essay, which was widely read at the State Department.\n\nDepartment employees say that in Foggy Bottom and beyond, civil and Foreign Service officers are doing their jobs and there are no work stoppages or visible expressions of protest. For instance, U.S. officials smoothly carried out their duties at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, whose main session last month coincided with the Democrats\u2019 launch of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nYet the frustration inside the department has occasionally spilled out into public, even before the Ukraine revelations placed the Trump administration\u2019s unorthodox approach to diplomacy at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn August, two Foreign Service officers announced their departures in tough-worded op-eds describing their deep disappointment with Trump.\n\nOne dismissed the belief, widespread among Trump aides, that a \u201cDeep State\u201d exists within the federal bureaucracy that is determined to thwart Trump\u2019s agenda. \u201cIf the resistance does exist, it should be clear by this point that it has failed,\u201d wrote the outgoing diplomat, Chuck Park.\n\nThe next month, another U.S. diplomat argued in an op-ed that now\u2019s the time to stay. \u201cIf we all leave when it gets hard, who will be left to champion American diplomacy?\u201d wrote Elizabeth Fitzsimmons, a deputy assistant secretary of State.\n\nMuch of the wrath is directed at Pompeo.\n\nState Department employees say they\u2019re furious that he hasn\u2019t publicly supported Yovanovitch, who testified that the deputy secretary of state, John Sullivan, admitted to her that she\u2019d \u201cdone nothing wrong\u201d but was being recalled anyway. (Pompeo declined to discuss Yovanovitch in an interview with POLITICO on Friday.)\n\nState Department staffers also are livid that Pompeo has framed his resistance to congressional demands for information as being about protecting U.S. diplomats.\n\nPompeo took over the department in April 2018, after morale had sunk unusually low under Trump\u2019s first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. Tillerson had largely sidelined career diplomats and seemed willing to go along with steep budget cuts Trump proposed for the State Department \u2014 cuts Congress has repeatedly blocked.\n\nPompeo earned goodwill early by naming career staffers, such as McKinley, to top posts and saying he wanted to give State its \u201cswagger\u201d back. And he still has his fair share of defenders: An administration official who watches State closely dismissed allegations of a morale problem under Pompeo as \u201cgarbage\u201d and said complaints were overblown.\n\nBut many State staffers say there\u2019s a growing sense Pompeo is willing to sell out the department to keep favor with Trump, whose backing he\u2019ll likely need if he runs for the Senate as many expect he will.\n\n\u201cPeople are generally disappointed that Pompeo seems to have abdicated principled leadership in favor of political games,\u201d a U.S. diplomat overseas said in a text.\n\nThe disappointment in Pompeo isn\u2019t limited to the Ukraine controversy.\n\nHe\u2019s been slammed for not immediately firing an assistant secretary of State, Kevin Moley, after an August inspector general report found that Moley had subjected career staffers to political retaliation. Pompeo aides say he can\u2019t fire a Senate-confirmed official, but there\u2019s no sign he\u2019s asked Trump to oust Moley, either. On Friday, Foreign Policy reported that Moley has announced he\u2019ll retire at the end of November.\n\nThe State Department inspector general is still probing other cases of alleged political retaliation. In some of those cases, which date to Tillerson\u2019s time, longtime career staffers found themselves demoted or otherwise poorly treated after being cast as disloyal \u201cObama holdovers\u201d by the conservative press.\n\nAt least one Trump political appointee accused of carrying out the retaliation, Iran envoy Brian Hook, still works for Pompeo. The inspector general report is due out this month, and career employees are watching closely to see what, if anything, Pompeo does in response.\n\nPompeo\u2019s delivery this month of a speech to the American Association of Christian Counselors about how his faith influences him also troubled many U.S. diplomats. It didn\u2019t help that the State Department heavily promoted the speech, including splashing the title of the speech, \u201cBeing a Christian Leader,\u201d atop its homepage. Amid complaints that the department was violating the traditional separation of church and state, officials changed the headline.\n\n\u201cImagine the uproar if any senior U.S. official, let alone the secretary of State, made a public speech and then put out the remarks via official U.S. government channels titled \u2018Being a Buddhist Leader.\u2019 Or \u2018Being a Muslim Leader.\u2019 So bizarre,\u201d the U.S. diplomat overseas said.\n\nFor his part, Pompeo insists he\u2019s happy to cooperate with the impeachment probe as required \u201cunder the law,\u201d but he\u2019s criticized Democrats for not permitting State Department lawyers to sit in on the testimonies.\n\nAs for diplomats who are testifying? \u201cI hope they go to tell the truth,\u201d he said.\n\nThe defiance shown by Yovanovitch and others may only deepen Trump and his top aides\u2019 long-standing suspicion of the State Department.\n\nJust days after Trump took office, White House officials were infuriated after around 1,000 State Department officials signed a \u201cdissent channel\u201d memo criticizing Trump\u2019s \u201ctravel ban\u201d on people from several Muslim-majority countries. The affair hardened perceptions among political appointees that the department was a Democratic bastion.\n\nLater in 2017, when he was pressed on why he\u2019d left so many top State Department positions empty, Trump said he simply didn\u2019t need them.\n\n\u201cThe one that matters is me,\u201d Trump told Fox News. \u201cI\u2019m the only one that matters, because when it comes to it, that\u2019s what the policy is going to be.\u201d\n\nBut for now, as the impeachment inquiry leads their colleagues to Capitol Hill, State Department staffers feel like they matter, too. \u201cThey are sad, tired and scared,\u201d one former State Department official said, \u201cthough glad to see colleagues stand up and fulfill their oaths.\u201d\n\nJake Sherman contributed to this report.", "description": "As U.S. diplomats defy the president and the secretary of State to testify before impeachment investigators, they\u2019re being hailed as heroes by colleagues who\u2019ve long felt abused.", "authors": ["Nahal Toosi", "Kyle Cheney", "Andrew Desiderio", "Michael Kruse"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1180430419-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
