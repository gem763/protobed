Sports gear and equipment are among luxury goods subject to UN sanctions.The official also said that North Korea has not responded to Seoul\u2019s offer for talks on the issue of sending a cheering squad for the upcoming football match. Any South Koreans seeking to visit North Korea should receive invitations from the North and also the Seoul government\u2019s approval for their trips to the communist state.On Monday, Unification Ministry spokesperson Lee Sang-min told reporters that it appears it will be difficult to send a cheering squad to Pyongyang for next week\u2019s match.How the players will travel to Pyongyang has not been decided yet, though it appears likely they will fly to the North\u2019s capital via Beijing rather than using other transportation modes. The official said that no discussions have been held between the two Koreas on the possibility of the use of a direct cross-border flight or land routes for transporting the players.A source said that Seoul is currently considering sending a few government officials to handle administrative affairs for the players as it did in April 2017, when the AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup qualifying tournament was held in Pyongyang, but it added that they will not include high-ranking officials. Observers hope that the game in Pyongyang could serve as a chance to bolster contact between the two Koreas at a time when cross-border exchanges have been mostly stalled amid a lack of progress in denuclearization talks.Yonhap", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
