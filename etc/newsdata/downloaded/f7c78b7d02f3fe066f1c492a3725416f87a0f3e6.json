Surrounded by my heroes, I watched Denzel , Queen Oprah Whoopi , Sir (Sidney) Poitier Halle , Dame Cicely (Tyson) and our angels John Singleton and Diahann Carroll honored,\" she captioned the gallery.\n\n\"The Armand de Brignac crashed against each soundstage as fireworks lit up the sky. Generations of blood, sweat and tears, success, excellence and brilliance.\"\n\nThe mother-of-three, who was widely praised for her acting role in the 2006 movie \"Dreamgirls,\" continued: \"It makes me so proud, so full, I could not stop crying.
