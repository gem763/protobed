If he manages to get it through parliament, we should see a wave of 'risk-on' trades coming into UK market.\n\n'However, let us wait and see all the details and then let the markets decide how likely it is for the UK parliament to accept it. For now, expect some positive momentum in sterling and domestically focused asset classes.'\n\nThis six-month graph shows how the pound has risen over the past week to a five-month high\n\nMichael Brown, senior analyst at Caxton, added: 'Sterling has gained over 1 per cent this morning on news that the UK and EU have reached a deal on Brexit.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson leaves the back of Downing St today on his way to Brussels\n\n'However, some of the wind has been taken out of the pound's sails after reports that the DUP are not yet onboard to back a deal. Therefore, the Parliamentary arithmetic for passing a deal looks challenging.\n\n'Attention will continue to focus on whether the new agreement will pass in the Commons on Saturday, while sterling traders will continue to pay close attention to developing headlines from this afternoon's EU summit.'\n\nThe announcement by Mr Johnson followed days of intense negotiations, but he is expected to face a tough task getting the agreement through Parliament.\n\nWith the Commons expected to sit on Saturday to discuss it - the first weekend session for 37 years - the DUP insisted it still could not yet back the Government's Brexit plans.\n\nThe stance of the DUP is important because the party wields influence over some Tory Brexiteers.\n\nAnti-Brexit demonstrators continue to protest outside the Houses of Parliament this morning\n\nIn Mr Johnson's announcement today, he tweeted: 'We've got a great new deal that takes back control.\n\n'Now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.'\n\nEuropean Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker tweeted: 'Where there is a will, there is a deal - we have one!\n\n'It's a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions. I recommend that EUCO endorses this deal.'", "description": "Sterling rose 1 per cent against the dollar this morning above $1.29 which marked a five-month high for the currency as the Prime Minister headed for a crunch EU summit in Brussels.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/10/19830790-0-image-a-357_1571306272976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
