To carry out the euthanasia, the physician drugged the patient\u2019s coffee without her knowledge and then had family members physically restrain the woman while delivering the fatal injection.\n\nProsecution spokeswoman Sanne van der Harg said prosecutors would carefully study the judgment before deciding whether to appeal.\n\nUnder Dutch law, people are eligible for euthanasia if they make a considered, voluntary request for it and if their suffering is hopelessly \u201cunbearable\u201d. Patients can draw up a written request for euthanasia to be performed sometime in the future, in an advance directive, which should specify the conditions determining when they want to be euthanised. Doctors must also seek the advice of at least one other independent physician before killing the patient.\n\nEuthanasia cases among people with advanced dementia are extremely rare; there have been fewer than 20 cases since the procedure was legalised in 2002.\n\n\u201cThe most important issue we have to judge as doctors is whether there\u2019s unbearable suffering for the patient,\u201d said Dr Rene Heman, president of the Royal Dutch Medical Association.\n\nHe said the organisation is currently working on guidelines for how doctors should handle euthanasia cases in people with advanced dementia.\n\n\u201cAs a doctor, you need to make sure people don\u2019t change their minds,\u201d he said.\n\nDutch investigators began scrutinising the case last December, marking the first time a doctor was criminally investigated for euthanasia.\n\nThe 74-year-old woman had renewed her living will about a year before she died, writing that she wanted to be euthanised \u201cwhenever I think the time is right\u201d. Later, the patient said several times in response to being asked if she wanted to die: \u201cBut not just now, it\u2019s not so bad yet!\u201d according to a report from the Dutch regional euthanasia review committee.\n\n", "description": "Prosecutors had accused doctor of failing to properly consult 74-year-old woman before administering lethal drugs", "authors": ["Associated Press In The Hague"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c5b10c3f9b5bed8f9554dfd9ba2da3a684d1caf/0_0_4032_2420/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ae0645e7e84082fdf6d4f4e2e7aff5ee", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
