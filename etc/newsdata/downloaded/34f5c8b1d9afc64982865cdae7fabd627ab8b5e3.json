Tehran has denied involvement in the attack.\n\n\u201cThe Yemeni people have a right to respond\u201d to Saudi military aggression, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Monday, calling the attack \u201creciprocal\u201d and \u201clegitimate defense.\u201d\n\nThe Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement that initial investigations \u201cindicated that the weapons used in the attack were Iranian weapons.\u201d The statement said that Saudi authorities were still working to determine the source of the attack.\n\nIran maintains advanced missile and drone programs as part of its national defense strategy and has transferred some of those weapons and technology to allied forces in the region, including Houthi fighters in Yemen, U.S. officials and weapons experts say. Tehran\u2019s drone and missile arsenals allow it to deter adversaries and support regional proxies, who can strike on Iran\u2019s behalf, analysts say.\n\n\u201cThe same strategic logic that animates Iran\u2019s missile program is evident in its drone program: it enables Iran to operate from range, keep its territory safe and strike at far-away targets,\u201d said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\n\u201cDrones, missiles and rockets all feature into Iran\u2019s asymmetric security strategy and are relatively cheaper to produce,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the Washington-based Brookings Institution, Iran has become a \u201csignificant exporter of missiles, missile production capability and missile technologies,\u201d including a long-range land-attack cruise missile experts say may have been used in Saturday\u2019s assault.\n\nThe sophisticated nature of the attack, which targeted sensitive oil installations and took roughly half of the state oil company\u2019s production offline, signaled a significant departure from previous operations claimed by Houthi rebels or launched by Iranian forces or their proxies in Syria.\n\nIran and Saudi Arabia are chief rivals in the region and the Saudi leadership has been a key advocate of the Trump administration\u2019s campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d against Iran. The United States has imposed harsh sanctions on the Iranian economy in a bid to compel Tehran to negotiate constraints on its missile programs and support for regional proxy forces.\n\n\u201cIf it is proven that cruise missiles came from Iranian territory, that would be a marked escalation and indicate a measure of confidence that Iran does not fear kinetic reprisal\u201d from either Saudi Arabia or the United States, said Taleblu.\n\n\n\nThis satellite overview shows damage to oil/gas infrastructure from weekend drone attacks at Abqaig on September 15, 2019 in Saudi Arabia.

There were between 17 and 19 direct hits on Saudi oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais, some 500 miles from Yemen\u2019s border, the U.S. official said.\n\nSaudi defense systems apparently failed to detect the cruise missiles and drones swarming over its borders, underscoring the kingdom\u2019s vulnerability to asymmetric warfare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just surprised that they got caught with their pants down,\u201d a contractor working for the Pentagon on drone defenses said of the Saudi security services. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.\n\n\u201cThey should have seen this coming,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to a United Nations expert panel on Yemen, Houthi fighters have in the past used what are known as \u201csuicide\u201d or \u201ckamikaze\u201d drones, some of which are similar to Iranian models. The Houthis have \u201cretained access to the critical components, such as engines, guidance systems, from abroad that are necessary to assemble and deploy them,\u201d the panel report said.\n\nA combined assault using both drones and cruise missiles could in theory \u201chelp with confusing and overwhelming defense systems,\u201d said Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, offering strategic advantage to the attacker.\n\nAccording to Markus Mueller, an analyst at the German Fraunhofer Group for Defense and Security, radar systems are typically able to identify drones flying over vast stretches of land, especially on even surfaces and outside cities or mountains areas.\n\nThe challenge, said Mueller, whose research focuses on unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, is to be able to respond to sightings and immediately protect sensitive infrastructure.\n\nBut analysts also pointed to the alleged use of cruise missiles in the assault, which experts say are low-flying and far more difficult to detect, as a more worrying development. The missiles can be precision guided and allow for more devastating strikes on specific targets.\n\nIran has reverse-engineered a former Soviet land-attack cruise missile, the Kh-55, and has also used Chinese anti-ship missile technology to bolster its own capabilities and those of its proxies, weapons analysts say. During the 2006 war in Lebanon, Iran-backed Hezbollah militants targeted an Israeli vessel with what weapons experts say was likely a Chinese C-802 anti-ship missile provided by Iran.\n\nIn its 2018 Worldwide Threat Assessment, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said that Houthi rebels attempted a cruise missile attack on an unfinished nuclear reactor in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nSuch missiles are \u201charder to detect and defend against than drones,\u201d said Rawan Shaif, an investigator at Bellingcat, a website specializing in open-source intelligence. \u201cThey can be incredibly precise if the person who is guiding them knows what [they] are doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a precision attack,\u201d she said of the assault on the Saudi oil facilities. \u201cIt was accurate to a \u2018T\u2019 if their aim was to hit\u201d specific infrastructure at the site.\n\nHenry Rome, an analyst at the New York-based political risk firm Eurasia Group, said that if Iran is responsible, that its strategy is to \u201cbuild leverage for eventual talks with Washington.\u201d\n\nIran wants to \u201ccompel the Trump administration to put their foot on the brakes of sanctions and push other countries to stand up for them,\u201d Rome said. The attacks on the oil facilities would be \u201cpushing the limits,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s too early to say that the guardrails are off.\u201d\n\nNoack reported from Berlin.
