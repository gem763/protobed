Monica Rochester said at a late afternoon press conference. \u201cWe should all be prepared for the very worst outcome.\u201d\n\nThe fire broke out on the Conception, owned by Truth Aquatics, around 3:00 a.m. PST, while it was anchored overnight only about 20 yards off Platts Harbor on Santa Cruz Island, officials said.\n\nFirefighters were still trying to douse the flames hours later when the 75-foot vessel sank in 60-foot waters.\n\n\u201c You can only imagine the tragedy. It\u2019s horrendous. There are some things you can\u2019t unsee \u201d \u2014 Bob Hansen, who rescued survivors of the dive boat fire\n\nFive crew members were awake and on the bridge when the flames began to consume the wooden-hulled vessel. Mayday calls captured the chaos at sea.\n\n\u201cI can't breathe,\u201d one person on the ship reportedly said in a call, according to ABC News. CNN reported that a Coast Guard dispatcher was heard questioning a Conception crew member about firefighting equipment and an \u201cescape hatch\u201d for passengers during a mayday call.\n\n\u201cCan you get back onboard and unlock the boat?... you don\u2019t have any firefighting gear at all? No fire extinguishers or anything?\u201d the dispatcher is heard asking. The crew member\u2019s replies were reportedly inaudible.\n\nThe five crew members fled and were rescued by a pleasure boat moored nearby.\n\nBob Hansen, the owner of Grape Escape, told The Daily Beast that he and his wife were out on the water for the weekend, anchored in a cove on Santa Cruz Island, when they heard pounding.\n\n\u201cI put on some shorts and walk outside and open the door and here\u2019s five guys in a little rubber boat and a 75-foot commercial boat on fire,\u201d said Hansen, 73, from Madera, California. \u201cIt was really on fire... the whole thing engulfed in flames.\n\n\u201cThe flames were shooting up 25 feet. I felt so helpless. It\u2019s just burning. There were five tanks that were blowing up\u2014or we thought there were\u2014these big pops.\u201d\n\nHansen brought the five crew members on board; one had a badly broken leg. He radioed the Coast Guard and waited for them to arrive, watching the scene unfold in horror, before ferrying the crew back to land.\n\n\u201cYou can only imagine the tragedy. It\u2019s horrendous,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cThere are some things you can\u2019t unsee.\u201d\n\nThe Coast Guard struggled to put out the fire\u2014which kept reigniting\u2014before it burned the Conception down to the waterline. Then the flaming hulk sank, leaving its bow pointing out of the water.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the worst case scenario you probably could have,\u201d Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.\n\n\u201cTo be in a remote location, to have a fire, to have minimal firefighting resources, and to have a fire that spreads quickly while most of the passengers are asleep\u2014you can imagine how bad that is.\u201d\n\nThe missing included one crew members. None of the passenger names were released, and authorities said the bodies that were retrieved would need to be identified through DNA.\n\nThe Conception came to rest at an unstable angle, complicating the recovery effort. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting to find the right time to go in and recover those bodies,\u201d Brown said.\n\nShayna Kreps, who lives in the Bay Area, told The Daily Beast one of her family members was on the trip. She said her family learned of the disaster on the news and had not been able to reach authorities.\n\n\u201cWe're angry that we\u2019re unable to get any information,\u201d she said.\n\nThe cause of the blaze was unknown, but because it was a diving trip, there could have been air tanks on board exploding and reigniting the flames. The FBI was on the scene and the National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a crew to the site.\n\nThe Coast Guard said the vessel was \u201cin complete compliance\u201d and that the owner was cooperating with the operation and investigation.\n\nTruth Aquatics\u2019 fleet is custom-designed for diving, according to its website, which says the company \u201ccaters to divers or ocean enthusiasts seeking a stress-free getaway.\u201d\n\nA calendar of events on the website indicated a three-day $665 Labor Day weekend trip was scheduled and being run by Worldwide Diving Adventures.\n\n\u201cDivers have the unique opportunity to explore the pinnacles of San Miguel Island,\u201d World Diving wrote of the trip. \u201cThe beginning of September is the best time to be at San Mig, which see strong winds and swell during much of the year.\u201d\n\nEfforts to reach Truth Aquatics and Worldwide Diving were unsuccessful. But the founder of Truth Aquatics, who has been retired for years, was stunned by the tragedy.\n\n\u201cI spent 40 years running boats and we never had a fire... I'm just flabbergasted,\u201d Roy Hauser told The Daily Beast, adding that he commissioned the Conception in 1980 and that it had undergone \u201ctremendous remodeling\u201d in the last three years.\n\nHauser wondered whether something electrical could have sparked the blaze given that it happened in the dead of night.\n\n\u201cThe galley wouldn't be open at that hour... The generator is running all the time. There'd be no cooking activity at 4 o\u2019clock in the morning. The crew only starts getting everything ready at 5:30 in the morning.\u201d", "description": "Four bodies have been recovered, and four others were spotted on the ocean floor after the vessel sank off Santa Cruz Island.", "authors": ["Tarpley Hitt", "Audrey Mcnamara", "Tracy Connor", "Julia Arciga", "Executive Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_6/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567439428/fireboat_invhs2"}
