That would be heartbreaking. It would be devastating. I don\u2019t want to celebrate being gay just one day at the end of June every year. I want to be able, every day, to say this is why I am as successful as I am, why I have a beautiful family\u2014this is how I think, this is how I feel, this is how I crave. It all comes from this well of my gayness. If we\u2019re going to get to our liberation just to say gay is just a matter of fact, then we\u2019re colluding with our adversaries.\n\nAn audience member followed up.\n\n\u201cI'm the mother of an 18-year-old who has two moms,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is profoundly straight. If your son were not gay, would you advocate that his straightness be as defining a characteristic or would you be okay with it just being a part of his life?\"\n\nHe answered that Gay Like Me \u201cis a permission slip for anybody who has something unique about them. And straightness is not unique. So many people have it.\u201d Being gay is different, he continued, in that \u201cwe\u2019re not taught to feel good about it. And to me, being gay is the best thing about me. It is the most important thing about me. And it\u2019s been a blessing. He doesn\u2019t have to make it the most important thing about him. He doesn\u2019t have to say it\u2019s the best part about him. But I do want him to think it\u2019s a blessing. And that\u2019s why I wrote the book.\u201d\n\nHe regards his son\u2019s statement that gayness is \u201cnot a big deal to him\u201d as a sign that \u201che\u2019s not taking full advantage of the gift that it is. And I want him to have faith in his gayness. I want him to rely on it, to invest in it, and that\u2019s what the book is. Here\u2019s how you build up your gay self-esteem. Here\u2019s your permission to take what is special about you, what is unique about you, and hit the gas on it.\u201d He added: \u201cI hope we start making being gay the gift that it is. We\u2019re 4.5 percent of the population. We\u2019re not a defect. We are a gift. We\u2019re chosen. And we have to make sure that it\u2019s treated like a gift, and I want people to join me in that.\u201d\n\nRead: How gay marriage became a constitutional right\n\nThe convergences and divergences with Sullivan are interesting.\n\nOn the one hand, Sullivan urged \u201cearning a living, raising kids in some cases, pursuing careers, sustaining marriages, and everything every straight person does without thinking twice about it,\u201d and declared that he seeks, in that sense, \u201ca kind of irrelevance for our sexual orientation\u2014a world in which the hetero and homo categories define none of us, straight or gay, and the category of human includes us all.\u201d On the other hand, he writes that \u201cthere\u2019s more to the souls of gay folk than just this kind of normalcy.\u201d Gay people remain a specific minority \u201cwith life experiences that do shape us differently, and a way of life that will always, in some ways, be a subculture, as well as a counterculture.\u201d", "description": "Richie Jackson and Andrew Sullivan disagree about how central being gay should be to one\u2019s identity.", "authors": ["Conor Friedersdorf", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/9_24_LGBTQ_Facebook_Stage_23/facebook.jpg?1569449273", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
