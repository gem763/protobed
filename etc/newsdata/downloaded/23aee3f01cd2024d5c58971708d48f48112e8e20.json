The international evidence tells us that it can have serious adverse impacts on children, and that it is not an effective.\"\n\nOpinion polls have suggested a majority of people in Scotland are opposed to a smacking ban - with critics arguing that the current law is sufficient, and that the changes risk criminalising \"good\" parents.\n\nBut most of the responses to a consultation on Mr Finnie's bill were in favour of a ban, and the move has been widely supported by children's charities.\n\nWhat physical punishment are parents currently allowed to use?\n\nIn Scots Law, all physical attacks on adults can be treated as assault - but children do not have the same protection.\n\nThis is because a person accused of assaulting of a child can claim a defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" or \"justifiable assault\" when they have used physical force as a form of discipline on children under the age of 16.\n\nWhen deciding whether the chastisement was reasonable, the courts take into account factors such as the nature of the punishment, its duration and frequency, the age of the child and the effect - both physical and mental - it had on them.\n\nIn practice, this generally means parents are allowed to smack their children on the body - but blows to the head, shaking or the use of an implement are illegal.\n\nAll physical punishment in schools and other education settings is already completely banned.\n\nHow will this change?\n\nImage caption John Finnie has won the backing of the Scottish government in his bid to change the law\n\nMr Finnie's bill will end the defence of reasonable chastisement, meaning parents could face prosecution for any use of physical punishment on their children.\n\nThis will mean that children have the exact same protection from assault as adults.\n\nThe bill uses the same definition of physical punishment, sometimes referred to as corporal punishment, used by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.\n\nIt includes hitting such as smacking, slapping and smacking with a hand or an implement, as well as kicking, shaking or throwing children, scratching, pinching, biting, pulling hair or boxing ears, forcing children to stay in uncomfortable positions, burning, scalding or forced ingestion.\n\nHow widespread is smacking anyway?\n\nA report published by a group of Scottish children's charities in 2015 found that the physical punishment of children was more common in the UK than in similar countries such as the US, Canada, Italy, Germany and Sweden.\n\nThe researchers estimated that between 70% and 80% of parents in the UK have used physical punishment, with children aged between three and seven the most likely to be smacked.\n\nThey also found that many parents do not view smacking as a \"good thing\", but believe that sometimes it is the \"only thing that will work\".\n\nAnd they said the use of physical chastisement has declined over the years alongside a shift in public attitudes, with \"convincing evidence\" that the decline has been steeper in the more than 50 countries around the world that have already banned smacking.\n\nResearch examining the views of children on smacking has suggested that it hurts and upsets them, and does not always stop bad behaviour.\n\nWhat do opponents of the ban say?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Opponents of the ban say mild smacking does no long-term harm to a child, but many charities and educational psychologists disagree\n\nA campaign against the ban has been led by the Be Reasonable Scotland group, which argues that the move - while well-intentioned - could do more harm than good.\n\nThe group argues that the current law only allows parents to use \"very mild discipline\" such as a smack on the hand or bottom - which would become a criminal offence in the future.\n\nThey say that the \"unnecessary\" changes will therefore do nothing more to help vulnerable children who are the victims of serious physical abuse, but will cause traumatic interventions in \"good\" families.\n\nAnd they have urged the government to instead invest in social work and other services to improve their ability to identify and tackle genuine abuse.\n\nWhat is the law elsewhere?\n\nIn 1979, Sweden became the first country in the world to ban corporal punishment in the home - with Scotland set to become the 58th to do so.\n\nParents in England and Wales can currently face criminal charges if they hit a child so hard that it leaves a mark, or causes bruising, swelling, cuts, grazes or scratches.\n\nHowever Wales is close to an outright ban, with a bill currently working its way through the Welsh assembly that would remove the defence of \"reasonable punishment\" that has been in force since Victorian times in England and Wales.\n\nThere have been calls for England to follow suit, with the Association of Educational Psychologists saying last year that smacking is harmful to children's mental health and should be banned.\n\nNorthern Ireland has similar legal provisions to those in England and Wales, while Ireland banned smacking in 2015.", "description": "A change in the law will make it a criminal offence for parents to use any physical punishment on their children.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17D00/production/_109063579_gettyimages-466347619.jpg"}
