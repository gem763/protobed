Maxine Waters Maxine Moore WatersOn The Money: Waters clashes with Trump officials over 'disastrous' housing finance plan | Dems jump into Trump turf war over student loans | House passes bill targeting anonymous shell companies House passes bill taking aim at anonymous shell companies Avoiding the snake in the grass: Let's not allow impeachment to divide us MORE (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nThe Hill's Emily Birnbaum and I take you there.\n\nHow Zuckerberg handled the heat:\n\nZuckerberg remained serious and reserved throughout the six-hour hearing, and even seemed aggravated during particularly rough lines of questioning as the day wore on.\n\nZuckerberg offered a staunch defense of the controversial cryptocurrency project, which has faced skepticism and pushback from regulators around the world since Facebook announced its plans over the summer. He said the cryptocurrency project could help bring financial services into the hands of billions of people worldwide.\n\n\"We've faced a lot of issues over the past few years,\" Zuckerberg conceded. \"I'm sure there are a lot of people who wish it was anyone but Facebook who is helping to put this forward.\"\n\n\"But there's a reason we care about this,\" he continued. \"Facebook is about putting power in peoples' hands.\"\n\nReactions:\n\n\"I think we should advance. I think we should seek innovation. I'm not opposed to some of the things that you're trying to do,\" said Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.). \"I'm gravely, gravely concerned about the implications they may have.\"\n\n\"I actually don't know if Libra is actually going to work,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nAnd to recap the hearing, check out our live blog on Zuckerberg's testimony.\n\nON TAP TOMORROW:\n\nThe Senate Banking Committee holds a hearing on data privacy, 10 a.m.\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\nGOP chairman expects another funding stopgap, potentially through March: Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby Richard Craig ShelbySenators have chance to double funding for women entrepreneurs\u2014they should take it On The Money: Trump dismisses 'phony Emoluments Clause' after Doral criticism | Senate Dems signal support for domestic spending package | House panel to consider vaping tax Senate Dems signal they'll support domestic spending package MORE (R-Ala.) on Wednesday said that deadlock over spending negotiations would likely require Congress to pass a new funding stopgap measure, called a continuing resolution, to prevent a shutdown after Nov. 21.\n\n\"Unless a miracle happens around here with the House and Senate, we will have to put forth another CR,\" Shelby said.\n\nWhile the House has passed 10 of its 12 annual spending bills, the Senate has not yet succeeded in passing a single funding bill, largely due to disagreements over Trump's proposed border wall.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate introduced a package of four smaller, non-controversial spending bills and is expected to begin the process of voting on amendments next week.\n\nUnlike the eight-week stopgap that extended funding past the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1, Shelby said that rumors of a longer CR into February or March were \"probably in the ballpark.\"\n\nThe Hill's Niv Elis explains why here.\n\nSenate rejects Dem measure on SALT workarounds: The Senate on Wednesday rejected a Democratic effort to overturn IRS regulations blocking workarounds to a portion of President Trump Donald John TrumpGraham to introduce resolution condemning House impeachment inquiry Support for impeachment inches up in poll Fox News's Bret Baier calls Trump's attacks on media 'a problem' MORE's tax law that is disliked by high-tax states.\n\nThe Senate voted against the Democrats' resolution, introduced by Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerTurkey says soldier killed despite cease-fire in Syria Schumer calls for FDA to probe reports of contaminated baby food How Trump and Pelosi went from bad to worse MORE (D-N.Y.), by a vote of 43-52. It was a mostly party-line vote, with Sen. Michael Bennet Michael Farrand BennetThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Trump's impeachment plea to Republicans Bennet, Udall aim to conserve 30 percent of US lands by 2030 From learning on his feet to policy director MORE (Colo.), a 2020 presidential candidate, the only Democrat to vote against the resolution and Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulSenate Democrats to hold caucus meeting Wednesday with ex-ISIS envoy Partisan squabbles endanger congressional response to Trump's course on Syria Paul blocks vote on House-passed Syria resolution for second time MORE (Ky.) the only Republican to vote in favor.\n\nWhile Democrats' effort was unsuccessful, it is notable because it's the first time they forced a vote to overturn IRS rules relating to Trump's tax law. The vote highlights how Democrats from high-tax states -- such as New York, New Jersey and California -- view the tax law's cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction as a top priority and the challenges they face in doing away with it.\n\n\"As bad as the Trump tax bill is for the whole country, it's even worse for states like New Jersey,\" Sen. Bob Menendez Robert (Bob) MenendezTurkey sanctions face possible wall in GOP Senate Paul blocks Senate vote on House-passed Syria resolution House to vote on resolution condemning Trump's Syria pullback MORE (D-N.J.) said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.\n\nThe details: The tax law Trump signed in December 2017 imposed a cap on the SALT deduction of $10,000.\n\nRepublicans capped the deduction in order to raise revenue to pay for tax cuts elsewhere in the law, and because they viewed the deduction as subsidizing higher state taxes. They have noted that analysts have estimated that most people got a tax cut for 2018 under Trump's law, even in high-tax states.\n\nBut efforts to repeal the SALT deduction cap have also faced criticism among progressives, because analysts across the ideological spectrum have estimated that repealing the SALT deduction cap would primarily benefit high-income taxpayers.\n\nThe Hill's Naomi Jagoda has more on the vote and the complicated politics here.\n\nHouse committee advances measure taxing nicotine in vaping products: The House Ways and Means Committee approved legislation Wednesday that would impose a federal tax on the nicotine used in liquid vaping products.\n\nThe panel approved the measure in a mostly party-line vote of 24 to 15, with Rep.

Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.) said at Wednesday's markup. \"For young people especially, who have less money and therefore higher price elasticity, taxes on vaping products are an effective way to decrease usage.\"\n\nThe Hill's Naomi Jagoda has more here.\n\nGOOD TO KNOW\n\nAn attorney for President Trump told a federal appeals court Wednesday that Trump could not be prosecuted even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York amid a legal fight over his financial records that seems destined for the Supreme Court.\n\nPresident Trump announced Wednesday that his administration would lift sanctions on Turkey after Ankara agreed to stop an offensive in northern Syria and agreed to a permanent cease-fire.\n\nUnemployment may be hovering near a 50-year low, but only 40 percent of America's workers say in a new survey that they are working in \"good\" jobs.\n\nODDS AND ENDS", "description": "Happy Wednesday and welcome back to On The Money.
