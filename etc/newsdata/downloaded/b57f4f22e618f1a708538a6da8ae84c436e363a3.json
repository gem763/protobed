From wandering through the birthday cake-coloured historic downtown streets; to swaying gently on a rocking chair on a porch of an old clapboard house; to exploring layers of history and its pencil-thin church spires: this is a place that encourages a second look. Uniquely for America, the heart of the historic downtown core is entirely walkable... if you don\u2019t want to clop about on a traditional horse and carriage ride, that is. And the beach is just a 20-minute drive.\n\nIn spring 2019, British Airways launched twice-weekly direct flights to the South Carolinan city, departing on Thursday afternoon and returning Monday morning, offering the intoxicating opportunity for a weekend break.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhat to do\n\nSee the Pineapple Fountain\n\nA sweet, if rather odd, icon of Charleston is the Pineapple Fountain frothing in the Waterfront Park. In the hot summer months, it\u2019s also a good place to cool off, and local kids enjoying splashing about in it. The pineapple is the defacto icon of Charleston: it\u2019s believed that on one of his voyages to America, Christopher Columbus discovered the fruit and brought it back to Europe.\n\nWander Rainbow Row\n\nGround zero of Charleston\u2019s cutesy Historic District, which stretches down to oak tree-shaded White Point Park, is the pastel row of houses that make up Rainbow Row on East Bay Street. A stretch of 13 fondant fancy-coloured townhouses, the longest stretch of Georgian houses in America, line up prettily with white shutters and historic plaques. Just follow the gaggle of Instagrammers taking selfies.\n\nVisit the Old Slave Mart Museum\n\nThis city, like many in the American south, has a complicated relationship with slavery. This history is examined to some degree at the Old Slave Mart Museum on Chalmers Street in the Historic District. It\u2019s built on the site of the former slave mart, believed to be the last slave auction facility in the state. Open Monday to Saturday, 9am-5pm; entry $8.\n\nSnoop around a historic house\n\nThe Historic Charleston Foundation maintains a number of historic houses in downtown Charleston. There are plenty to choose from, but perhaps the grandest are the Nathaniel Russell house, the Georgian double-style Heywood-Washington house and the buttermilk yellow Aiken-Rhett mansion, where governor of South Carolina William Aiken Jr once lived.\n\nExplore the Lowcountry\n\nThe Lowcountry \u2013 the coastal, marshy lands that stretch from South Carolina into Georgia further south \u2013 is picture-perfect with dripping Spanish moss, forests of oak trees and heat like an electric blanket.\n\nPalmetto Bluff, two hours\u2019 drive south from Charleston towards Savannah, Georgia, is set in the midst of this marshland and home to the upscale resort of Montage Palmetto Bluff, where alligators prowl the waters and \u201cporching\u201d is a local sport. Rooms from $405 a night, B&B.\n\nTrot around town in a horse-drawn carriage\n\nThe quintessential Charleston thing to do is to be pulled around the shaded historic streets in a traditional horse-drawn carriage. In an hour-long narrated tour, carriages set off from Anson Street and go on a random route chosen by a bingo ball. Tours cost $25 per person.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe Dewberry, a dowdy former federal building from the outside, is a whirr of mid-century flair inside: think burgundy leather banquettes and armchairs, period features and a giant metal-worked map of South Carolina on the wall. There\u2019s a boutique outpost of beloved southern magazine Garden & Gun on the ground floor and Henrietta\u2019s brasserie serves reimagined Lowcountry cuisine. Rooms from $246, room-only.\n\nHotel Bennett, which calls itself the south\u2019s \u201cgrandest hotel\u201d, has a far more luxury vibe with a grand lobby and bowls of tightly packed flowers. If you\u2019re not staying, come for a coupe at the baby-pink champagne bar. Rooms from $314, room only.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nSlightly North of Broad (or Snob for short) does a decent line in fun southern cuisine on the well-trodden East Bay Street in the Historic District. The shrimp and grits, a quintessential southern dish, comes with giant prawns and creamy local grits (a sort of minced corn) packed with plenty of flavour. Brunch is popular, so book ahead.\n\nHenrietta\u2019s, on the ground floor of the Dewberry, is an upscale French-American brasserie ideal for a smart-casual dinner or weekend brunch. Belly-busting options include cheddar biscuits or buttermilk fried chicken and waffles.\n\nBe prepared to queue for the fresh-fresh-fresh seafood at 167 Raw, which is first come, first served. Oysters, clams, shrimps and lobster rolls are very much the order of the day here.\n\nWhere to drink\n\nEight floors above the Dewberry is playful cocktail lounge Citrus Club, serving look-at-me concoctions such as the frozen pina colada and the Polynesian pearl diver. You can only get up here either by being a guest of the hotel or by booking in advance. Open Wednesday to Sunday, 2-10pm.\n\nIn a secret space just off East Bay Street is the dark speakeasy Gin Joint, which sorts its cocktails into categories such as \u201cstrong and stirred\u201d and \u201cnot for the faint at heart\u201d. Bar snacks include a cheese selection and roasted bone marrow. Between 5-7pm daily, cocktails are just $5. Open Monday to Wednesday 5pm-12am; Thursday 3pm-12am; Friday to Saturday 3pm-2am; Sunday 3pm-12am.\n\nBlue clapboard-fronted Second State Coffee is the place to sit among Charleston\u2019s movers and shakers while propping up a heart pine wood table sipping a cold brew. Open Monday to Friday, 7am-7pm; Saturday to Sunday, 8am-6pm.\n\nWhere to shop\n\nCrossing four blocks in the Historic Quarter is the fan-cooled Charleston City Market, which first opened in 1804. Today it sells trinkets such as local art, ceramics, coffee and clothing \u2013 if you need a souvenir, this place is the first place to look.\n\nEvery Saturday morning, Marion Square hosts a farmers\u2019 market selling food and local art.\n\nKing Street is one of Charleston\u2019s main spines and home to big American brands including Madewell, Sephora and Anthropologie.\n\nArchitectural highlight\n\nThere\u2019s a riot of architectural styles in Charleston, ranging from Art Deco and Queen Anne to Italianate and Gothic Revival, but the one defining style is the \u201csingle house\u201d, which are all over the Historic Quarter, usually hiding under a the shade of an oak tree. They are narrow, single-room houses that date back to the 1800s.\n\nNuts and bolts\n\nWhat currency do I need?\n\nUS dollars.\n\nWhat language do they speak?\n\nEnglish.\n\nShould I tip?\n\nThere is a strong tipping culture, where 20 per cent on top of any restaurant or bar bill is expected. It might occasionally be added on already, in which case you only need to add extra if you were particularly impressed with the service.\n\nWhat\u2019s the time difference?\n\nFour hours behind GMT.\n\nWhat\u2019s the average flight time from the UK?\n\nBritish Airways runs a twice-weekly direct service from London Heathrow to Charleston, which takes nine hours. Fares start from \u00a3500 return.\n\nPublic transport\n\nRide-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft are your best bet.\n\nBest view\n\nCharleston isn\u2019t a tall city (if you discount the church spires, of which there are hundreds) so from Citrus Club atop the Dewberry Hotel, there are 360 degree views across the city and the impressive Arthur Ravenel Jr cable-stayed bridge to the beaches beyond.\n\nInsider tip", "description": "Rarely has a city captured the imagination quite like Charleston, a port town\u00a0set on a peninsula in the low-lying South Carolina flatlands.", "authors": ["Cathy Adams"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/26/11/shutterstock-406879552-0.jpg"}
