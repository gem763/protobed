(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News)\n\nPacific Gas and Electric Co. is warning of another potential round of electrical outages later this week as Northern Californians prepare for a bout of dry, offshore winds predicted to create dangerous fire conditions. More than 200,000 customers could be affected, according to PG&E, while the National Weather Service hoisted fire weather watches for millions in the Golden State.\n\nThe fire danger will rise thanks to northeasterly winds and plummeting humidity beginning late Wednesday and extending until early Friday. Wednesday evening into Thursday afternoon looks to be the most dangerous time for potentially rapid fire spread should ignition occur.\n\nThe area at greatest risk stretches from the northern Coast Range and foothills through the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys, as well as the northern Sierra Nevada.\n\n\n\nDry air with low dew points surges in as northeasterly winds push air down the mountains. (Weatherbell.com)\n\nNorth and northeasterly winds will gust 30 to 40 mph in the foothills, and closer to 50 mph in the mountains. The \u201cdownsloping\u201d effect means any air swept downhill will both dry out and accelerate, sapping ground vegetation of moisture. Relative humidities could fall as low as 10 to 15 percent. Napa and Sonoma counties are areas of particular concern.\n\nThreat expands south by Thursday\n\nThose same tinderbox conditions will overspread central and southern California by Thursday morning. A fire weather watch includes Los Angeles and reaches down to the Mexico border. Their dangerous weather will be even more intense, with high temperatures in the mid- to upper 90s, humidity as low as 2 percent and stronger winds reaching up to 60 mph in the mountains.\n\n\n\nBurned trees stand on the empty lot of a home destroyed in last year's Camp Fire in Paradise, Calif. (Jim Mcauley/Bloomberg News)\n\nThe forecast is for \u201cwidespread critical conditions to Los Angeles and Ventura Counties,\u201d the National Weather Service in Los Angeles wrote in its morning forecast discussion. The agency went further on an ominous note, stating, \u201cThis has all the makings for a dangerous fire weather scenario, similar to worse than the recent October 10-11 event that produced the Saddleridge Fire.\u201d The Saddleridge Fire, which has since torched 8,800 acres, was at 92 percent containment Tuesday.\n\nDangerous fire weather conditions possible Thu-Fri as moderate-strong #SantaAna winds combine with hot temperatures, single digit humidities, and very dry fuels.

Instead, sundowner winds \u2014 caused by the cooling and downhill surge of air adjacent to the mountains \u2014 will kick in after dark. And with little overnight recovery in humidity, this has the makings of a 48-to-72-hour period of extreme fire danger.\n\nConditions will improve into the weekend for Northern and central California, and by early next week to the south.\n\nPlanned outages are a new reality\n\nAhead of the dangerous forecast, utility provider PG&E has advised 209,000 customers of a potential \u201cpublic safety power shut-off\u201d planned in Northern California, depending on how the forecast evolves. Among those affected are 9,197 \u201cmedical baseline\u201d customers who depend on electricity for various health reasons. Each customer has been notified of the possible shut-off; electric-dependent customers with medical issues who have not responded to PG&E\u2019s notification will be visited by a company employee.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Strong winds and extremely dry conditions will bring critical fire weather concerns Wednesday - Thursday. A fire weather watch has been issued.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udca8 Strongest winds will be Wednesday - early Thursday.

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News)\n\nThe \u201cpublic safety precautionary shut-offs\u201d are a new implementation by PG&E, after the sparking of the Camp Fire in 2018. That fire killed 86 people, reducing the town of Paradise to ashes. PG&E reached an $11 billion settlement that covers Northern California fires from 2017 and the 2018 Camp Fire. This could be the second precautionary shut-off in California this month. Between Oct. 9 and 12, power was cut to more than 738,000 customers in 30 California counties because of the wildfire threat.\n\nOne of the most robust conclusions of climate change research is that wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent and severe in large parts of the American West as the climate warms, particularly in California. This is occurring as summers become hotter and drier and precipitation becomes more variable in the winter, with lurches from drought to flood and back again becoming the norm.\n\nIn an indication that an uptick in large wildfires is already occurring in California, 15 of the top 20 largest wildfires in state history have all occurred since 2000.\n\nAndrew Freedman contributed to this report.", "description": "As dangerous fire weather builds Wednesday and Thursday, more than 200,000 customers could lose service to \u201creduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire ignitions.\u201d", "authors": ["Matthew Cappucci", "Meteorologist", "Capital Weather Gang", "October At Pm", "Matthew Cappucci Is A Meteorologist For Capital Weather Gang.
