Thousands of IS prisoners are held in Kurdish-run camps in the region.\n\nEurope has taken an increasingly tough line with Turkey and several countries, including Britain, France and Germany, have imposed arms embargoes on Ankara over the operation.\n\n- Jihadist fears -\n\nThe UN Security Council warned in a unanimously adopted statement of a risk of \"dispersion\" of jihadist prisoners, but stopped short of calling for an end to Turkey's offensive.", "description": "US Vice President Mike Pence arrived in Turkey Thursday to push President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for a ceasefire in Syria after Ankara rebuffed international pressure to halt its deadly offensive against Kurdish forces.", "authors": ["Shaun Tandon With Nazeer Al-Khatib In Ras Al-Ain"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.4ro6_Mxeu38vJYSD2xagA--~B/aD01NjA7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/0be8ce08fe4191d3e57c3134cd98d5c40897e109.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
