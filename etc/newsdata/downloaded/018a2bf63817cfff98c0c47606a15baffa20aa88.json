Amy Klobuchar on Sunday criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy style and cast doubt on the explanation of why peace talks with the Taliban have been put on hold indefinitely.\n\n\u201cTo me, this is just no way to conduct foreign policy,\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate and Minnesota senator said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201c\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cYes, we should be negotiating with the Afghan government, and we should be negotiating with the Taliban to try to end the bloodshed in this country, which has been going on for decades.\u201d\n\nTrump on Saturday said he had intended to hold peace talks involving the Taliban and Afghanistan\u2019s government at Camp David, but that they had been shelved because of a Taliban attack.\n\n\u201cThe whole focus of this, of course, is to bring our troops home, which I strongly support,\u201d Klobuchar added.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

But then they kept negotiating after that happened, through Saturday, so the whole thing doesn\u2019t quite make sense to me.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that peace negotiations with the Taliban are off indefinitely after the Islamic militia admitted responsibility for a recent attack in which a U.S. soldier died.\n\nSgt. 1st Class Elis A. Barreto Ortiz, a paratrooper, was killed in the attack that Trump tweeted last night had also killed 11 other people. The president said the Taliban admitted to the attack in an attempt to build \u201cfalse leverage.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported Sunday, citing anonymous officials, that suspension of the talks had happened more so because the Taliban was resisting American terms and plans for the Camp David summit had been rushed.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game show \u2014 these are terrorists,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cThe way he conducts foreign policy \u2014 this reminds me exactly of North Korea. He loves the showmanship. He wants to have that moment but then all the details aren\u2019t done, and then we end up in a worse place on the world stage than we were before.\u201d", "description": "\u201cTo me this is just no way to conduct foreign policy,\u201d she said.", "authors": ["Victoria Guida"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fb/56/e4faebb74834abe464bf43e5d4d6/190624-klobuchar-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
