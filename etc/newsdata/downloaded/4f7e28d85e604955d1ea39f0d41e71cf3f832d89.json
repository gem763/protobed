The people of the DA know that we went out and fought for an incredible dream, and we went hard and fought for holding the centre of politics,\" said Maimane.\n\nBut the writing was on the wall. Five months later, it seems the DA's dream is all but dead and Maimane's departure has left South Africa's biggest opposition in turmoil, with the ruling ANC laughing all the way to the 2021 local elections.\n\nThis week in Friday Briefing, we consider whether the DA's liberal agenda has been its undoing. Assistant-editor Pieter du Toit compares Maimane's departure to that of his predecessor in the liberal opposition of 33 years ago, Frederik Van Zyl Slabbert. Editor Adriaan Basson explains how Helen Zille broke the party she built up over the years, and analyst Mpumelelo Mkhabela asks if the DA pursued the wrong liberalist ideals in its quest for power.\n\nAlet Janse van Rensburg\n\nOpinions editor", "description": "Recent developments have exposed deep seated divisions in the DA on which direction it should take ideologically to renew its legitimacy as an opposition party capable of winning elections.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9516/0739edf481ed43f4b028f21e9128cb80.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
