The report does not explore this or similar challenges.\n\nIt merely states: \u201cEU tariff and non-tariff requirements will apply to UK exports crossing the land border from Northern Ireland into Ireland, and exporters will need to ensure that they comply with these requirements.\u201d\n\nAnd it restates the policy, outlined by Theresa May in March, that tariffs will not be applied to any goods entering Northern Ireland from Ireland.\n\nIt also reconfirms its commitment to the common travel area, allowing British and Irish citizens to enjoy equal rights on both islands \u201ceven in the event of leaving without a deal\u201d.\n\nPeople holding a UK driving licence will need a motor insurance green card if they are taking a UK-registered vehicle into Ireland, something that will impact on the thousands of Irish-heritage families in Britain who spend their holidays in the Republic.\n\nPeople living in border areas might incur roaming charges on their mobile phone bills, something that was done away with several years ago as part of an all-island telecommunications policy.\n\nEU citizens currently in the UK\n\nThe report says Brexit will end free movement of people, allowing the government to \u201cboost the labour market\u201d through a \u201cfairer immigration system\u201d based on skills and talent.\n\nIt restates its commitment to EU citizens who \u201cwill continue to be able to work, study and access benefits and services such as the NHS\u201d on the same basis after 31 October.\n\nEU citizens wishing to remain in the country have until 31 December 2020 to apply for settled status.\n\nSome 1.5 million EU citizens have already been granted settled status and 1.7 million have already applied.\n\nEU citizens entering the UK after 31 October\n\nA new scheme, called European temporary leave to remain, will be introduced for EU citizens who want to settle in the UK after 31 October.\n\nFrom January 2021 the government will introduce an Australian-style points based system that will apply to all EU citizens newly entering the country.\n\n\u201cEU citizens moving to the UK if we leave without a deal on 31 October 2019 will be able to work, study and access benefits and services in the same way as EU citizens resident before exit day.\n\n\u201cHowever, to remain in the UK after 2020 they will be able to apply for European Temporary Leave to Remain (Euro TLR) which will last three years,\u201d it says.\n\nThe paper makes it plain that employers will be expected to look to employ and train up workers locally.\n\nEU citizens visiting the UK after Brexit may have to get health insurance if current reciprocal arrangements, through the European health insurance card, do not survive after Brexit.\n\nThere are also clear instructions for employers.\n\nUp to 2021 employers will not need to distinguish between EU citizens with settled status and those without, or to distinguish between EU citizens who are already entitled to live in the country and new arrivals.\n\n\u201cIn the interim, EU citizens will be able to evidence their right to live and work in the UK by using valid EU passport or national identity card, as now.\u201d\n\nBorder\n\nPlanes will continue to fly.\n\nBut trains and coach journeys may be impacted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Planes will continue to fly in and out of the UK after a no-deal Brexit. Photograph: Hannah Mckay/EPA\n\nTrade\n\nTrade will be heavily impacted.\n\nIn a no-deal scenario, the UK and the EU will trade on World Trade Organization terms. For the first time in 50 years the UK will be able to \u201carticulate\u201d its \u201cown voice\u201d in the WTO and set its own tariffs, the report claims.\n\nExporters to the EU should check the additional paperwork required by the EU and ensure they are ready.\n\nHauliers should explain to drivers that a customs export declaration (P2P) must be completed before they will be allowed to progress on a ferry journey to the EU. The driver should check with the trader that the goods have received the P2P from HMRC before going across the border.\n\nThose in the fishing industry will need to fill out catch certificates for all exports and potentially three other additional documents to fulfil EU laws.\n\nHauliers can refer to a checklist of must-dos provided by the government.\n\nThe chapter also runs through the many other requirements, such as the \u00a310 permit required by UK hauliers on export routes, and challenges that could disrupt cross-border trains and coach services.\n\nImporters will need to pay tariffs on a range of goods including meat, dairy produce and clothing. The government finalised its tariff schedule on Tuesday 8 October with just three changes to the tariff schedule published in March.\n\nExporters will also face hefty tariffs overnight for goods sold in the EU and to other countries where there is no deal. In a no-deal Brexit this will include the 52 countries which already have a deal with the EU.\n\nThe paper says the government \u201cis working intensively to deliver continuity\u201d on EU trade but warns that the EU\u2019s common external tariff will apply on 60% of the UK\u2019s exports to the EU.\n\nIn some sectors such as life sciences and electronics, the effect of these taxes will be \u201cminor\u201d but, in what farmers will consider an understatement, it says \u201cother sectors will be more affected\u201d with, for example, tariffs of 65% on boneless beef and 53% on fresh bone-in lamb.\n\nServices\n\nUK companies and British citizens living in the EU who rely solely on EU rights to work, will no longer be able to provide services on the same terms in the event of no deal.\n\nIn practice this means companies exporting services, which have not established a legal entity elsewhere in the bloc, will not be able to continue to do so.\n\nFor Britons living in the EU who trade services such as accountancy, translation services and architecture will not be able to continue to do so outside the country of their residence unless they have acquired such a right through alternative routes such as citizenship.\n\nData\n\nAnyone trading or storing data in the EU faces immediate consequences in a no deal.\n\nThis includes police, hotels, businesses, social media companies, transport and tech companies.\n\nThe report states that the government intends to bring the General Data Protection Regulation that governs data in the EU into domestic law.\n\nBut as this will not happen overnight and the EU is not making an exception. \u201cOrganisations receiving personal data from the EU/EEA need to make alternative legal arrangements,\u201d it says.\n\nThe government is continuing to press for the EU to change its mind and grant the UK an exemption if Britain leaves without a deal, the report adds.", "description": "From employing EU citizens to driving in Ireland, plan aims to show UK ready for crashing out", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf308d7aa5141672a2ef0e11e385a8879334c019/0_4_4470_2682/master/4470.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d56c58af7c9a2881392a371dc8f20da4", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
