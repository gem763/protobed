And there\u2019s one theory that has taken the clear lead.\n\nWas Clayton Kershaw tipping his pitches?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt's possible, many keen viewers believe, that the Nationals spotted something in Kershaw\u2019s delivery that tipped them off to which pitch was coming next.\n\nFabian Ardaya, who covers the Los Angeles Angels for The Athletic, was among those pushing the theory after spotting Nationals' lead-off hitter Trea Turner demonstrating what appeared to be Kershaw's pitching motion in the dugout.\n\nIs Trea Turner explaining how Clayton Kershaw may be tipping his pitches? pic.twitter.com/oOjsKBhpoi \u2014 Fabian Ardaya (@FabianArdaya) October 5, 2019\n\nTo be clear, the suggestion is not that Washington was stealing signs. The thought is they were able to spot some of Kershaw\u2019s tendencies before and during his pitches, and then exploited them when proven correct.\n\nSeven of Washington's first 13 batters reached base in Friday\u2019s 4-2 victory. Two of those batters reached after being hit by a pitch, so those might be less important to the story. On the other side, two of the outs recorded by Kershaw were given away by Washington on bunts.\n\nOf the remaining nine batters he faced in the first two innings, the sequence was double, walk, single, pop out, strikeout, ground out, single, double and strikeout.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough Kershaw appeared to settle down beginning in the third inning, the hard contact didn\u2019t end there. Howie Kendrick just missed a home run and the exit velocity allowed by Kershaw remained abnormally high.\n\nThe Nationals haven't capitalized on every opportunity, but they're barreling up Clayton Kershaw tonight.\n\n\n\nHe allowed an average exit velocity this season of 87.2 mph. The Nationals, through three innings, are at 98.3 mph. \u2014 Sam Fortier (@Sam4TR) October 5, 2019\n\nThat suggests it\u2019s possible Washington had a good idea what was coming next more often than not over the first three innings.\n\nTo Kershaw\u2019s credit, he did manage to limit the damage in the early going and eventually settled down by retiring nine of the final 11 batters he faced. Over his six frames, he allowed just those three early runs on six hits.\n\nWas Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw tipping his pitches during NLDS Game 2? (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\nClayton Kershaw\u2019s response\n\nDespite Kershaw\u2019s improvement as the game went along, the speculation over whether he was tipping pitches continued to grow.\n\nAfter the game, Kershaw was questioned about the possibility and offered a not surprisingly vague response.\n\nClayton Kershaw was asked about possible pitch tipping. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll check it out.\u201d \u2014 J.P. Hoornstra (@jphoornstra) October 5, 2019\n\nKershaw\u2019s not the type of guy to make excuses. Even if he knows or feels he was tipping pitches, it\u2019s not something he\u2019d likely admit. In fact, given how he improved in the middle innings, it\u2019s possible he did know or did feel it and adjusted adequately enough to keep his team in the game.\n\nOf course, some fans are just hanging their hat on the Clayton Kershaw is bad in the postseason narrative that\u2019s followed him around for nearly a decade. To each their own. Everyone has to have to a reason to help everything make sense or fit their own narrative.\n\nThe only thing that matters now for Kershaw and the Dodgers is what happens moving forward. At this point, there is no guarantee Kershaw will pitch again this postseason. If he does, his performance will answer a lot of questions. More importantly, it will help determine the Dodgers\u2019 postseason fate.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Was Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw tipping his pitches during NLDS Game 2?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7aeRbwNLjI06l5QQYdRDjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HPosYefbZDJi1egwdS9YDQ--~B/aD0xOTAzO3c9Mjg1NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/aa89b980-e7aa-11e9-bcb7-1f41289b35dc", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
