Protesters gathered nearby. But inside, the president found a friendly audience of legislators whose political futures are closely tied to how well he performs in next year\u2019s election. They greeted him a chant of \u201cfour more years.\u201d\n\nTrump obliquely addressed his earlier insults against Baltimore, promising Republicans would \u201cfight for the future of cities like Baltimore that have been destroyed by decades of failed and corrupt rule.\u201d\n\nHe said crushing regulations, crippling taxes and \u201cunrestricted migration\u201d have undermined law enforcement and devastated America\u2019s inner cities. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to step up and doing something about it because we can\u2019t allow that to happen to our great cities,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump had lashed out at Baltimore in a series of July tweets critical of Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, who represents the city\u2019s majority-black 7th Congressional District. Cummings also chairs the House oversight panel conducting numerous investigations of the administration\u2019s policies and work.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump emphasized some of the biggest wins of his presidency, such as boosting military spending, slashing regulations and expanding a program that gives veterans the option to see private doctors outside the Veterans Affairs medical system. He touted the $1.5 trillion tax cut package passed in 2017 and promised to deliver another tax cut proposal next year.\n\n\u201cWe are working on a tax cut for the middle-income people that is going to be very, very inspirational. It\u2019s going to be something that I think it\u2019s what everyone\u2019s really looking for,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt will be a very, very substantial tax cut for middle-income folks, who work so hard.\u201d\n\nLawmakers gave him a standing ovation when he promised to uphold the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nThe president hasn\u2019t committed to specific gun legislation, but White House officials, lawmakers and Capitol Hill staff have held frequent meetings to discuss options aimed at curbing gun violence following shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, that left more than 30 people dead over a single August weekend.\n\nThe president addressed lawmakers one day after the Supreme Court cleared the way for his administration to deny nearly all asylum claims from Central Americans. He highlighted that win as well as the victories of Republicans Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy in special elections this week in North Carolina. He told the Republicans he expected them to win back the majority in the House next year.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re loved out there,\u201d he asserted.\n\nTrump spoke as Democratic presidential candidates debated in Houston. The audience laughed as he mocked some of his top challengers and claimed that more people would be watching him. \u201cThey should be watching the debate but they\u2019re probably watching this,\u201d Trump said.\n\nPolice blocked off a wide perimeter around the hotel. But a few blocks away, demonstrators inflated a giant rat carrying a cell phone and adorned with yellow hair and a red tie to make clear their mocking intentions. Protesters waved signs with messages like \u201cTrump and the GOP are the real rats\u201d and \u201cWelcome rat king.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the president should apologize for his Baltimore comments, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Trump \u201cmade a very good case why many major cities have challenges.\u201d He said the president\u2019s trip \u201csymbolizes that, yes, he cares about Baltimore,\u201d adding that Trump is working to give people in poverty \u201ca better opportunity.\u201d\n\nJennifer Amann, who lives in Fells Point, not far from the hotel where Trump was speaking, laughed when told that McCarthy said Trump\u2019s visit demonstrates that he cares about the city and its residents.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need visits, we need policies that help the people,\u201d Amann, who moved to Baltimore 16 years ago, said of Trump and Republican lawmakers. \u201cThe proof\u2019s in the pudding and they don\u2019t do anything to support this city.\u201d\n\nOn an adjacent corner, a smaller yet vocal group of Trump supporters gathered, and the two groups engaged in an extended back-and-forth.\n\nJoe Murphy, of Owings Mills, Maryland, called the Trump protesters \u201cso un-American and disgusting.\u201d He said Trump was not a racist.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s here today to talk about opportunity zones, where he\u2019s going to clean up the most disgusting parts of this city \u2014 and I\u2019ve lived here all my life and there are a lot of disgusting parts,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you guys have against that?\u201d\n\nThe GOP retreat was scheduled for Baltimore before Trump got into his spat with Cummings.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s verbal broadsides, Cummings invited the president to join him on a tour of his district, from the poorest parts of Baltimore to more well-to-do areas in suburban Baltimore and Howard counties.\n\nTrump has not backed away from his charges that Democratic leaders are responsible for the ills of America\u2019s biggest cities. But for now, he\u2019s making the argument in a less personal and less hostile manner. He\u2019s also trying to win over blacks and Hispanics by citing employment gains they have made during his tenure.\n\nBaltimore, a once-gilded American seaport, has undeniable drug and violent crime challenges. The city saw more than 300 homicides in 2018 for the fourth year in a row. It also contends with deep-rooted poverty and swaths of the city are populated with vacant, boarded-up homes.", "description": "President Donald Trump sought to boost the spirits of Republican lawmakers Thursday, mocking Democrats and promising a new tax cut package, as he returned to...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR229_19trum_ZG_20190912221258.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
