They have even promised a referendum campaign against it, putting a repeal on the 2020 ballot.\n\nUber and Lyft aren\u2019t making money even as they deny drivers the usual benefits of employment. Losses have increased as the two companies have scaled. I have written that Uber is barreling toward worthlessness.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe new bill, if signed into law by California Governor Gavin Newsom, may just hasten the inevitable.\n\nThe Bill\u2019s Threat to Uber Stock\n\nThe business model of Uber and Lyft has always been based on flexibility. But the requirements for driving \u2014 a license and simple background check \u2014 don\u2019t guarantee safety. Since the drivers are contractors, the companies deny responsibility for incidents, which has led to lawsuits.\n\nAB5 bill codifies an \u201cABC Test\u201d for determining whether workers are employees or contractors. Contractors would have to be free of the employer\u2019s control and direction. They would have to be working outside the normal course of the company\u2019s business. The work would also have to be outside the worker\u2019s normal occupation.\n\nWest said in his press conference Uber can show its drivers meet that test and thus aren\u2019t employees. Then how can Uber guarantee rider safety?\n\nThis has always been the problem with gig-economy jobs. There\u2019s no worker protection, so drivers don\u2019t get Social Security, health insurance, paid sick days, workers\u2019 compensation or overtime. There\u2019s also no consumer protection. Miriam Pawel of The New York Times says AB5 calls that arrangement feudalism.\n\nLimited Jurisdiction\n\nAB5 only applies to California.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board has ruled that, as a matter of federal law, Uber and Lyft drivers are contractors. A judge has agreed, although drivers are appealing. A new class action suit, based on AB5, was filed in federal court Sept. 12.\n\nWith an unemployment rate of 3.7%, and even many fast food jobs paying over $15 per hour, it\u2019s surprising that Uber and Lyft can get enough qualified drivers to meet demand.\n\nUber and Lyft get around consumer protection by looking the other way. They fight against stronger checks before courts and regulators and take their lumps when they lose.\n\nThis Is a Global Story\n\nUber\u2019s efforts to expand globally have run into stiff resistance in Europe. The company sold its business in Asia but is gaining some traction in Africa.\n\nThe best-performing units of Uber appear to be Uber Eats (its food delivery service) and Uber Freight (which links trucks with freight loads). Both were specifically excluded from a recent Uber layoff, where 435 people, 8% of the workforce, went out the door.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Uber and Lyft Stock\n\nUber next reports earnings Nov. 7. Analysts are expecting a loss of about $1.4 billion on revenue of $3.7 billion. Lyft reports Nov. 6 and is expected to report a loss of about $450 million, $1.60 per share.\n\nThe original vision for Uber may just not work. But if Uber Freight can arbitrage trucking rates, and Uber Eats gains traction, the company could use that success to find a business model that does work.\n\nIt needs to, because investors are rapidly losing patience. Even with recent gains Uber stock remains 18% below its initial trade in May, and Lyft is now 40% below its initial trade in April. The meter is running on both companies, and time is running out.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.
