Chinese defence minister Wei Fenghe said on Monday the South\n\nChina Sea is an inalienable part of China's territory. \"We will\n\nnot allow even an inch of territory that our ancestors have left\n\nto us to be taken away,\" Wei said. The Chinese vessel had been thought to have stopped the\n\nsurveys when it headed away from Vietnam's exclusive economic\n\nzone in early August to Fiery Cross Reef, a man-made island\n\ncontrolled by China that was built on a disputed South China Sea\n\nreef. Vietnam and the Philippines also have competing claims on\n\nthe reef.\n\n\"It's very likely that China will send an oil rig to drill\n\nin the area where the Haiyang Dizhi 8 had conducted seismic\n\nsurveys in Vietnam's exclusive economic zone,\" Hop said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Chinese ship heads away from Vietnam after disputed surveys in South China Sea", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/Brazil-Stock-Market_3_800x533_L_1414427437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
