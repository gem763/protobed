(AP) - Sam Kerr scored in the ninth minute and the Chicago Red Stars advanced to the National Women\u2019s Soccer League championship match with a 1-0 victory over the Portland Thorns on Sunday.\n\nThe Red Stars are heading to a final for the first time after four straight semifinal losses. They\u2019ll play the North Carolina Courage, which defeated the Reign FC 4-1 in Sunday\u2019s early semifinal.\n\nThe Red Stars finished second in the league with a 14-8-2 regular-season record, including victories in their final five games.\n\nKerr, the league\u2019s Golden Boot winner, scored 18 goals in 21 matches to break her own league record for goals in a single season. Widely expected to leave the NWSL and play in Europe next season, Kerr\u2019s goal Sunday was her first ever in the playoffs.\n\nThe Thorns, who finished third in the standings with an 11-6-7 record, had won just once in the last five matches with only one goal over that span. Portland had not dropped a match to the Red Stars since the 2013 season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sam Kerr scored in the ninth minute and the Chicago Red Stars advanced to the National Women's Soccer League championship match with a 1-0 victory over the Portland Thorns on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/nwsl_thorns_red_stars_soccer_94040_c0-146-3500-2187_s1200x700.jpg?50e117847fba66c2d01efa712c1454d317fcd0c6", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
