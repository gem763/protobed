Globally, protectionism seems to be intensifying, and it\u2019s bleeding into the real economy, undermining business confidence and investment. The global economic expansion is slowing down. The U.S. clearly isn\u2019t immune, despite Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that trade wars are easy to win. Monetary policymakers are busily scrambling to avert disaster. The European Central Bank unveiled a huge stimulus program in September; Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell is getting the Fed back into quantitative easing (which he is careful to stipulate isn\u2019t quantitative easing), and just about everyone expects another cut to the target interest rate later this month, with more to come. If the yield curve isn\u2019t outright inverted \u2014 a classic recession sign \u2014 it\u2019s as close as darnit is to swearing.\n\nThe global political mess isn\u2019t helping calm fears. The U.S.-China trade war seems to be escalating, depending on which day you look at it. The impeachment investigation of Trump is only getting more contentious, and U.S. foreign policy seems to be becoming more unpredictable by the day. (As the Kurds can now attest.) As for the U.K. and Brexit, with an Oct. 31 deadline looming \u2014 well, let\u2019s not even go there.\n\nAnd yet, despite all this awfulness and uncertainty, the S&P 500 isn\u2019t very far off its all-time high. Neither is the S&P/TSX composite. The EuroSTOXX 50, comprising the biggest and most liquid stocks in Europe \u2014 benighted, low-growth, recession-fearing Europe \u2014 is up nearly 16 per cent on the year; the smaller-cap STOXX Europe 600 is up nearly 13 per cent.\n\nHas sentiment ever been so negative when markets have been so buoyant? Surely, something has got to give, right? And given the indicators flashing yellow or red lately, it\u2019s safe to assume that the stock market is due for a comeuppance.\n\nThe thing, though, is this: \u201csafe\u201d doesn\u2019t always turn out to be right. As much as there looks to be plenty of downside risk to equities, investors might want to be careful not to overreact to data or news and abandon equities altogether.\n\nFor instance, consider the U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index for September, which came out at the start of this month. The PMI came in at 47.8 per cent \u2014 a sub-50-per-cent read for the second month in a row, suggesting that U.S. manufacturing activity was contracting. (Anything above 50 per cent indicates growth.) That is the lowest mark for the manu PMI since June 2009, at the tail end of the Great Recession. Meanwhile, the index for new manufacturing export orders was an even worse 41 per cent \u2014 the lowest level since March 2009, again marking a second straight month of decline.\n\nIt\u2019s quite reasonable to infer from these numbers that the Trump trade war is starting to bite at home, and that it could very well bleed out beyond manufacturing and undermine the rest of the real economy. You could look at the immediate reaction of the stock market \u2014 the S&P 500 fell sharply after the PMI\u2019s release \u2014 and conclude that at least some investors were getting the point by getting out.\n\nAnd yet, it\u2019s also reasonable to note the counterbalances to the gloom in this case. One is that employment and consumer spending (supported by low interest rates) remain very strong \u2014 and consumers account for about two-thirds of U.S. GDP. Another is that manufacturing now represents barely more than 10 per cent of U.S. economic activity. Manufacturing companies, however, represent more than 40 per cent of the S&P 500\u2019s market capitalization, which helps to explain the post-PMI swoon in a way that doesn\u2019t suggest widespread fear so much as tactical reallocations.\n\nThe point is, with so much uncertainty, downside risk might be getting too much play, and that might lead some investors to ignore upside risk.\n\nSo where\u2019s the upside? Easy money. Low, low rates. Central bankers who will do anything to forestall a recession.\n\nThe continuing low-to-lower interest rate environment could do a few positive things for equity valuations. One is that as much as policy-watchers worry that central banks are pushing on a rope in hopes of stimulating economic activity, in the end it just might work. Monetary stimulus typically takes a while to kick in; it\u2019s possible we\u2019re just in the lag phase now, and come this time next year we\u2019ll be talking about an earnings rebound rather than an earnings recession.\n\nThe other big point about low interest rates is that they create very few places \u2014 other than equities \u2014 for money to go if investors want to generate return. Fixed income? Yes, big investors will plow into government bonds for safety, especially with risk aversion running so high, but the returns will be low and, in a declining interest rate environment, seem bound to get lower. There is already more than US$17 trillion in negative yielding debt out there, and this dark-mirror pool is getting bigger \u2013 Greece just issued a three-month note at a negative yield.\n\nCompare all that negativity with just the dividend yield of the S&P 500 \u2014 it\u2019s almost two per cent, and it\u2019s higher than the yield on a 20-year U.S. Treasury. In fact, low rates put a premium on dividend-paying equities, and many of those are blue chip companies in defensive sectors. So they might provide a hedge against a downturn while offering exposure to the upside in terms of yield. And on the earnings side, low rates support higher stock valuations \u2014 historically, anyway.\n\nOf course, the global economy could still go completely pear-shaped and everyone will lose. But we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know. Even though things look gloomy, investors might regret it if they completely run for cover \u2014 the gloom might turn out to be a passing cloud.", "description": "Joe Chidley: Investors might want to be careful not to overreact to data or news and abandon equities altogether", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trader-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
