The lead guest is defense secretary Mark Esper, who\u2019s set for \u201cFace the Nation\u201d and \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d to defend Trump\u2019s orders. He\u2019ll emphasize that the U.S. opposes the Turkish offensive against the Kurds, even if it\u2019s not prepared to stand in the way. (Does he support non-military pressure on Erdogan, such as sanctions, to pressure him to retreat?) He\u2019ll also be asked about the curious incident from Friday in which U.S. troops in one Syrian town came under Turkish artillery fire. Supposedly the Turks were given the exact location of all Americans in the area in order to avoid precisely that scenario. What happened? Is Trump\u2019s former lead envoy in the war against ISIS correct in believing that it was no innocent mistake?\n\nThe two most interesting commentators on Trump and Syria today will each appear on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d One is Rand Paul, who in 2015 went as far as to call for American support for an independent Kurdish state if the Kurds agreed to take the lead in the war against ISIS. They did take the lead, yet Paul now applauds Trump\u2019s decision to abandon them to Erdogan\u2019s onslaught. He\u2019ll be asked to explain whether there\u2019s any such thing in his mind as a too-hasty withdrawal. The other guest is James Mattis, who\u2019s been under heavy pressure from anti-Trumpers to voice his criticisms of the president but has resisted so far. The pressure this morning will be tremendous \u2014 not only are we in the middle of an impeachment inquiry, with Trump having recently reiterated his hope that Ukraine will investigate the Bidens in front of the cameras, but it was Trump\u2019s desire to retreat from Syria that led Mattis to resign in protest as SecDef in the first place. He\u2019ll be asked what he thinks of the president choosing to turn his back on an ally that led the fight against ISIS\u2019s caliphate. What will he say?\n\nImpeachment is in the mix this morning too, of course. If it\u2019s Sunday, it means Adam Schiff is on TV somewhere: He\u2019ll talk to \u201cFace the Nation\u201d about how far Democrats might be willing to go if Rudy Giuliani and others flatly refuse to provide evidence after being subpoenaed. Meanwhile, Eliot Engel, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee that\u2019s investigating the Ukraine matter, will appear on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d They\u2019ll both be asked what the arrests of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman mean for the impeachment inquiry going forward. The criminal jeopardy in which Parnas and Fruman find themselves presumably gives Democrats more leverage to extract information from the two about what they and Rudy were doing in Ukraine, and maybe how much the president knew about it.\n\nOne more person to watch on Syria is Dem Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who\u2019ll be on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Van Hollen is partnering with Lindsey Graham on a bill that would slap sanctions on Turkey if they don\u2019t end their offensive against the Kurds. What are the prospects of veto-proof majorities in both houses of Congress? He\u2019ll chat about it with Chris Wallace.
