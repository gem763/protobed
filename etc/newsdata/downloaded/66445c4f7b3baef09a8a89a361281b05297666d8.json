Zarif said on Thursday any U.S. or Saudi military strike against Iran would result in \"all-out war\". REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina/File Photo\n\nThe United States has been discussing with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies possible responses to Saturday\u2019s attack, which they blame on Iran and which U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described as an act of war on the kingdom.\n\n\u201cI am making a very serious statement that we don\u2019t want war; we don\u2019t want to engage in a military confrontation ... But we won\u2019t blink to defend our territory,\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif told CNN in an interview.\n\nAsked what the consequence of an American or a Saudi military strike on Iran would be, Zarif said \u201can all-out war\u201d.\n\nZarif earlier warned on Twitter that what he described as the B team - including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman - was deceiving U.S. President Donald Trump into a war against Iran.\n\nMeanwhile, a senior advisor to Iran\u2019s top authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on Gulf countries to \u201ccome to their senses\u201d, Iran\u2019s semi-official Fars news agency reported.\n\n\u201cThey (U.S. and Saudi Arabia) have realized that playing with the tail of a lion is highly dangerous and that if they take action against Iran at any time, they know there will be no tomorrow for them in the region,\u201d Fars quoted Hossein Dehghan as saying.\n\nIran\u2019s regional rival Saudi Arabia is leading a Sunni Arab coalition fighting the Houthis in the impoverished state on the tip of the Arabian peninsula - part of a regional proxy war between Tehran and Riyadh across the Middle East.\n\nIran has denied any involvement in the attacks, which was claimed by Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group.\n\n\u201cThey accuse Iran because they don\u2019t believe the oppressed Yemeni nation has reached such a capability,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said, state news agency IRNA reported.\n\nMANY OPTIONS SHORT OF WAR\n\nTrump struck a cautious note on Wednesday. He said there were many options short of war with Iran, which denies involvement in the Sept. 14 strikes that initially halved Saudi oil output. He ordered more sanctions on Tehran.\n\nZarif also said in a tweet on Thursday that Pompeo was trying to delay issuing visas for the Iranian delegation to the upcoming United Nations General Assembly.\n\nTrump said he is not looking to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during a U.N. event in New York later this month, where Pompeo said the Aramco attacks would be a major focus and suggested Riyadh could make its case there.\n\nTensions have been high between arch foes Washington and Tehran since last year, when President Donald Trump quit Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear pact with world powers and reimposed sanctions on Tehran that had a crippling impact on its oil-reliant economy.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday he had ordered his Treasury Secretary to substantially increase sanctions on Iran.
