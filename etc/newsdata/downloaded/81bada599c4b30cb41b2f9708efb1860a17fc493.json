Photo: Ricky Havlik\n\nIt\u2019s mid-September, and Rafael Morffi and his team still have two weeks to do the seemingly impossible: launch a live, weekly, nationally broadcast two-hour wrestling show in prime time, for a major cable network. It\u2019s something no company has endeavored to do since Ted Turner\u2019s now-defunct World Championship Wrestling premiered its Monday-night Nitro program on TNT in September 1995.\n\nAs it happens, Morffi\u2019s in-progress production has a home on TNT as well. It\u2019s called AEW Dynamite, and debuts October 2 at 8 p.m., live from Washington, D.C.\u2019s Capital One Arena. (The show will broadcast from different cities each week.) AEW stands for All Elite Wrestling, the buzziest and most audacious promotion to put its hat in the ring in at least a generation. Morffi, who has worked for Vince McMahon\u2019s World Wrestling Entertainment, as well as perennial upstart rival Impact Wrestling, is AEW\u2019s live-events director. At the time of our conversation, he\u2019s about halfway through his fourth month on the job, which makes him a relatively senior staffer.\n\n\u201cWe know we have a challenge in front of us,\u201d Morffi says, understating the matter. \u201cWe\u2019re moving fast and furious. We\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nThat goes twofold for wrestling fans, who for two decades have had few televised alternatives outside routine WWE programming, anchored by USA stalwart Monday Night Raw and the more mobile SmackDown, which has bounced around the schedule and shifts to Fox on Fridays beginning October 4. But while WWE has been preoccupied with expanding its global footprint, and adding subscribers to its fledgling streaming network since acquiring WCW in 2001, an independent wrestling culture has flourished, ironically reminiscent of the sprawling territorial patchwork synonymous with the sport before McMahon and WWE barnstormed the business in the 1980s.\n\nBy the turn of the 2010s, Impact (originally branded as TNA) surfaced on Spike, one of its several landing spots, and grassroots promotions such as Philadelphia-rooted Ring of Honor found their way onto the cable guide\u2019s outer margins. Today, a modest cluster of competitive outfits \u2014 and enterprising TV executives \u2014 has seized on the sport\u2019s renewed, cultish buzz. New York-based Major League Wrestling airs its Fusion series every Saturday night on beIN Sports, while the Mark Cuban-founded and Anthem-owned AXS TV airs Impact Tuesday nights and New Japan Pro Wrestling and WOW-Women Of Wrestling Saturday nights.\n\n\u201cThe overall atmosphere of pro wrestling is very similar now to what it was in 1995,\u201d observes Bryan Alvarez, co-host of popular podcast Wrestling Observer Live, co-author of The Death of WCW, and author of 100 Things WWE Fans Should Know & Do Before They Die. \u201cIn 2010, WWE was a lot stronger in a lot of ways than they are now. They had way more viewers. The level of disgruntlement among fans today is much higher. People were not as hungry for an alternative then as they are now.\u201d\n\nOn cue, along came the cohort of Cody Rhodes, the Young Bucks (brothers Matt and Nick Jackson), Kenny Omega, Marty Scurll, and \u201cHangman\u201d Adam Page. Collectively, they dubbed themselves The Elite, complete with a YouTube series titled Being the Elite that boasts close to 400,000 subscribers and formally declared AEW\u2019s formation via a viral New Year\u2019s Day video.\n\nRhodes, son of late legend Dusty and brother of active fan favorite and AEW signee Dustin (long known as Goldust in WWE), left WWE in 2016 and made waves in Ring of Honor and New Japan. It was on that sojourn that he struck an alliance with the other Elite members, who\u2019d been top-billed guys for some time in those same organizations. A brainstorming session led to a hugely successful, independently produced live event, All In, which sold out the 10,000-plus capacity Sears Centre in suburban Chicago last September and led them to billionaire Jacksonville Jaguars co-owner Tony Khan (his father, Shahid, is principal Jaguars owner), an avowed wrestling nut with cash to spare. (Unsubstantiated reports have suggested the Khans made an up-front investment of $100 million in AEW. When asked for clarification, AEW reps responded that they do not disclose financial information.)\n\nBy fall 2018, the groundwork for AEW was laid, followed by months of personnel tweaks (Scurll stayed on with Ring of Honor), crunching numbers, and careful hiring (veteran play-by-play man Jim Ross as commentary lead and backstage consultant, former WWE World Champion Jon Moxley as a marquee main-eventer). By late summer \u201919, the company had pulled off two well-regarded pay-per-view events \u2014 May\u2019s Double or Nothing in Las Vegas and August\u2019s All Out, an ostensible sequel to All In that sold out in 15 minutes \u2014 partnered with Bleacher Report\u2019s streaming service, B/R Live, for a pair of exhibition-like free specials, and crowned its first-ever world champion, ex-WWE/WCW icon Chris Jericho. All of it was preparation for Dynamite\u2019s October 2 bow.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate to have that summer run,\u201d Morffi concedes. \u201cThat helped us iron out everything and get the kinks out, while still getting our brand out there in a tangible format.\u201d\n\nEx-WWE/WCW icon Chris Jericho was recently crowned AEW\u2019s first-ever World Champion. Photo: James Musselwhite\n\nAEW\u2019s shotgun approach is effectively an inversion of how a promotion typically evolves \u2014 from broadcast to PPV, not the other way around \u2014 and it\u2019s reflective of Khan\u2019s top-down emphasis on analytics, an extension of his approach to the Jaguars (not to mention soccer club Fulham FC, which he co-owns as well) and TruMediaSports, his analytics-driven engineering firm.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason why we did two shows on B/R Live was to harvest data,\u201d confirms Morffi. \u201cWe offered it for free purposely to expose the product and collect that information, to know where our fanbase is coming from initially.\u201d\n\nJudging by the names and faces who\u2019ve been front and center on Dynamite marketing materials, fans are looking for characters like towering MMA expert Luchasaurus (whose tag partner, Jungle Boy, is the late Luke Perry\u2019s son, Jack) and openly transgender woman Nyla Rose as much as they\u2019re banking on the star power of company figureheads like co-executive vice presidents Cody Rhodes and Omega. Beyond that, it remains to be seen how Dynamite might pare down the B/R Live events\u2019 open-audition atmosphere into a precision combat-sport and storytelling machine.\n\nTherein lies the most pressing question for TNT and Dynamite, and above all wrestling fans and potential converts: Will all the beta testing and sunk costs translate into an awesome and inspiring two hours of TV every Wednesday? If it can\u2019t satisfy that initial threshold, any discussion about whether AEW can ultimately share the air with WWE \u2014 which cannily resituated its streaming network\u2019s NXT program, a showcase for developing talent, to USA directly opposite Dynamite \u2014 will feel premature at best. (Neither WWE nor Fox made anyone available for comment as of press time.)\n\nAEW World Champion Jericho was part of both Nitro and SmackDown\u2019s earliest days, so he knows a thing or two about how WWE operates. Yet, in a phone interview just eight days prior to Dynamite\u2019s inaugural effort, he betrays no worries about McMahon\u2019s maneuvering. Nor, for that matter, is he sweating any outside skepticism about whether AEW can distinguish itself.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve assembled this amazing roster with six to eight top main-event stars, which is what you need to start a wrestling company,\u201d Jericho outlines, adding that the financial backing and TV deal are, without a doubt, equally instrumental. But AEW\u2019s status as an industry disrupter also hooks onto a narrative with baked-in appeal for today\u2019s super-attentive pop-culture polyglots, regardless of how steeped they are in wrestling lore.\n\nAs Jericho pointedly notes, \u201cThis is the first time ever in the history of wrestling that fans can be with a major company from the start \u2026 It\u2019s a new-age promotion where I can go, \u2018These are my guys, and I want to grow with them.\u2019 You can see all this loyalty we have from fans who aren\u2019t even watching WWE programming. They\u2019re not watching WrestleMania, but they\u2019re watching All In.\u201d\n\nThe fact that AEW\u2019s leadership had already gathered metrics to back up Jericho\u2019s assertion, not to mention having sold out arenas like Las Vegas\u2019s MGM Grand, was plenty to grease the wheels with TNT. (Khan\u2019s deep pockets and devotion to the product didn\u2019t hurt, either.) And from the get-go, AEW was keenly aware that for Dynamite to succeed on its own merits \u2014 not purely in terms of whether it can pull some of WWE\u2019s market share \u2014 the packaging and presentation had to lean into the show as sport, not spectacle. (WWE had long since messaged its content as \u201csports entertainment.\u201d)\n\nNyla Rose, the first openly transgender woman to sign with a major U.S. pro wrestling promotion, has been front and center in AEW\u2019s promotion for Dynamite. Photo: James Musselwhite\n\nThat calculus neatly coincided with the owner-wrestlers\u2019 central philosophy about their trade. AEW chief brand officer Brandi Rhodes, who also performs in the women\u2019s division and frequently accompanies her husband Cody to the ring, underscores that point when she reminds everyone that from AEW\u2019s onset, she and her colleagues have \u201cbeen very honest about feeling like the bell-to-bell action needs to be well represented in wrestling, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re making our main focus.\u201d Rhodes, speaking a week and a half before Dynamite\u2019s unveiling, expresses appreciation for WWE and others\u2019 heightened theatrics, but is firm that with Dynamite, \u201cYou\u2019re probably going to see everything happen inside the arena. You\u2019re probably not going to see a lot of things backstage. Everything is directed toward the sports end of the show.\u201d\n\nThat suits the suits at TNT just fine. The network has an established reputation broadcasting the NBA and NCAA, as two examples, and sees Dynamite as a natural fit in that rubric as opposed to a novelty outlier.\n\n\u201cLive television is still the king of the castle,\u201d asserts Brett Weitz, general manager of TNT, TBS, and TruTV. \u201cAnd what we looked at [with Dynamite] was a live sporting event that we felt was serving an underserved marketplace.\u201d Referencing the public perception of WWE\u2019s ubiquity, Weitz adds that, \u201cWhen you just have a monopoly for 20 years, you don\u2019t know who\u2019s out there in the wings waiting for something different. \u2026 I will bet there is a very different audience in the AEW audience that is hopefully migrating to this network because of this offering.\u201d\n\nIf Weitz is right, it could paradoxically forecast doom for the MLWs and Impacts of the world, which are at varying stages in their life cycles but conjoined in their struggle to stay relevant and grow viewership. If Dynamite soars, the benefits could trickle down \u2014 or AEW could become an unwitting accomplice to a duopoly alongside WWE. It\u2019d be nice to think that there\u2019s enough talent and time and innovation to make everyone whole, but fans could become overwhelmed by choice and limit their intake to the most readily available and broadly appealing options.\n\nImpact executive vice president Scott D\u2019Amore is focusing on the former likelihood for now, looking to the world of fast food to illustrate his optimism. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s is number one,\u201d he begins, speaking on a conference call with Ed Nordholm, executive vice president of Anthem Sports & Entertainment. \u201cBurger King is number two. That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not a market share for Subway and Wendy\u2019s and everybody else.\u201d Tellingly, Nordholm adds the caveat that Anthem, which recently acquired a majority stake in AXS from Cuban, views the acquisition less as a chance to \u201cgird itself in any war\u201d with other wrestling companies and more as an opening to widen its portfolio of general-interest entertainment. In effect, it\u2019s the polar opposite of TNT\u2019s approach in integrating AEW. \u201cCertainly, having a recognized destination network is great for Impact,\u201d D\u2019Amore elaborates. \u201cBut it is much more than that from an Anthem perspective.\u201d\n\nPush comes to shove, a still-nebulous formula of ratings results, social-media engagement, pay-per-view buy-ins, and overall brand filtration will determine Dynamite\u2019s fate, and possibly answer the question of whether this latest wrestling boomlet has legs. Lifelong fans and passionate pundits like Alvarez hope the resolution is a resounding yes.\n\n\u201cIn the \u201990s, even if you weren\u2019t a fan, people knew The Rock, they knew Stone Cold Steve Austin,\u201d he reminisces, hopeful that Dynamite will spark a similar phenomenon. \u201cI feel like people are just waiting. If the show is great, they\u2019re going to be excited. That level of mainstream appeal of professional wrestling could be coming back. We just have to wait and see.\u201d\n\nJericho, for one, is tired of the speculation and anticipation, and can\u2019t hardly wait until the opening bell sounds.\n\n\u201cEnough\u2019s enough,\u201d he avers. \u201cLet\u2019s get out there and start walking instead of just talking.\u201d", "description": "A behind-the-scenes look at the television debut of upstart promotion All Elite Wrestling, whose primetime bow on TNT represents a critical juncture for wrestling\u2019s evolution beyond WWE.", "authors": ["Kenny Herzog"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/01/all-elite-wrestling/all-elite-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
