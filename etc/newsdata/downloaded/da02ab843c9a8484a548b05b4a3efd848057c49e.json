The German was up 1.3%, back above 12,000 for the first time since Aug. 1, while France\u2019s was up 1.2%.\n\nThe wave that lifted all boats was a report in the South China Morning Post saying that the embattled head of Hong Kong\u2019s legislature, Carrie Lam, is about to withdraw a controversial bill that sparked what morphed into three months of protests against encroachments on citizens\u2019 rights.\n\nThe news was a particular boon to luxury goods companies, which derive a disproportional amount of their revenues and profits from Hong Kong\u2019s boutiques, and which cited the protests as hitting their performance in the last quarter. French-based Kering (PA: ), the owner of Gucci, rose 3.7%, while Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy rose 3.4%. U.K.-listed Burberry gained 3.6%, while Italy\u2019s Moncler and Salvatore Ferragamo rose 3.5% and 2.7%, respectively. Switzerland\u2019s Richemont rose 3.9%.\n\nAsia-focused banks also stood out in London, with HSBC rising 2.1% and Standard Chartered (LON: ) rising 3.6%.\n\nMore localized support came from the U.K., where parliamentary opponents of a No Deal Brexit won a motion late on Tuesday to wrest control of the House of Commons agenda, effectively wrecking Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s tactics for extracting last-minute compromises from the EU on life after Brexit. The U.K. was one of the worst-performing indexes in Europe on Wednesday, as a 1.5% surge in sterling hit the multinational components of the index, but still rose 0.8%.\n\nThe biggest outperformer was again Italy, where the 30 rose 1.6% after the members of the Five Star Movement voted to support a deal with the center-left Democratic Party to form a new government.\n\nEven so, it may be too early to get the champagne out. The developments \u2013 all three of them positive at first glance \u2013 have their own shadows. There was no mention of whether Lam had sought or received Beijing\u2019s blessing for her climbdown. That means the threat of more forceful intervention has not been banished.\n\nSecondly, Prime Minister Johnson responded to his defeat by saying he wants a general election, which on the evidence of the past three years \u2013 and current opinion polls - is no guarantee of an end to the whole Brexit psychodrama.\n\nThirdly, the tensions between the members of Italy\u2019s new coalition are so obvious and ingrained that it seems unlikely the government will last much longer than any other of its 70 predecessors since the Second World War.\n\nHowever, those all seem like being problems for another day.", "description": "StockBeat:  Triple Boost from Politics Send Europe's Markets Flying", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF030BG_L.jpg"}
