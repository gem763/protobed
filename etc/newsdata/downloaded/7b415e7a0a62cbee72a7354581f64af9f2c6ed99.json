Bernie Sanders hosted a Medicare for All town hall Monday. During the Q&A portion of the event, he was asked about how he would pay for his proposal. When Sanders said taxes would go need to go up (while premiums went away) he got a follow-up question.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling us you\u2019ve got to raise taxes to do this. Why can\u2019t we adjust the current budget, for defense, and pay for us now as opposed to making us, you know, this futuristic thing?\u201d a woman asked. She added, \u201cI think it\u2019s a great idea, we just have to turn it around because raising taxes is not probably going to fly for everyone here in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the issue. This is why some people don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Sanders replied. He didn\u2019t identify who the \u201csome people\u201d were but he does have a rival candidate who has repeatedly refused to admit that taxes would need to go up: Elizabeth Warren.\n\nAfter agreeing that the defense budget was too high, Sanders continued, \u201cI don\u2019t want to lie to you. If I told you, magically, that you\u2019re going to have great health care and it\u2019s not going to cost you a penny would you believe me? So we got to be honest.\u201d\n\nIt sort of sounds like Sanders is calling Warren a liar. Warren appeared on Stephen Colbert\u2019s show two weeks ago and refused to admit that her plan would raise middle-class taxes. She did the same thing in an interview with NBC News last week.\n\nSanders even seemed to express some sympathy for Warren\u2019s position. \u201cNow I understand what the media will do. Every time I go on the media \u2018How much are you going to raise taxes?\u2019 not \u2018How much are you going to reduce\u2014what does it mean to reduce premiums, co-payments, and out-of-pocket expenses,'\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo we have to be mature enough to say, okay, if I\u2019m stopping you, hypothetically, from paying $20,000 a year in premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, you\u2019re paying $10,000 more in taxes. Last I heard, you\u2019re in pretty good shape,\u201d he continued.\n\nSanders went on to emphasize again that he\u2019s telling the truth: \u201cI can\u2019t lie. I can tell you this is what goes on in Canada. People pay for it but they pay less than what we pay here.\u201d\n\nGood for Sanders for admitting the obvious about taxes, I guess, but Tommy Christopher points out that his $20,000 in premiums example isn\u2019t very realistic:\n\nSanders is absolutely correct that his plan would be far more comprehensive than most any other plan, but on average, most Americans don\u2019t pay anywhere near what Sanders says in premiums and out-of-pocket costs. People with employer-sponsored health insurance pay an average of $1400 a year in premiums and $800 a year in out-of-pocket costs, and individual plans average a little over $5000 a year in premiums without subsidies \u2014 which families earning less than 100,000 a year qualify for.\n\nSanders has actually used the figure $28,000 before as the cost of health care for a family of four, but that figure includes the portion of the payment (nearly 60%) paid by an employer. So the actual out-of-pocket would be closer to $12,000 as the Post\u2019s fact-checker pointed out. So if taxes do go up $10,000 you\u2019re not going to feel like you\u2019re saving much at all. And if, like every other big entitlement program in history, taxes go up more than anticipated you might be paying more.\n\nFinally, if Sanders wanted to be really honest, he could have told the woman who suggested taking money out of the defense budget that our current defense budget is about $700 billion a year while Medicare for All would probably cost about $33 trillion over 10 years. That works out to more than four times the entire defense budget per year. So you could zero out defense spending and it would only cover a small fraction of the cost of his plan.", "description": "He means you, Elizabeth Warren.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Bernie-Sanders-magically.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
