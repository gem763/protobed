'We know as a group how much better we can be. 'You look around and you see the ability in the squad. We just didn't knuckle down and transform what we had been doing in training into the game.\n\n'This is a whole new experience for some of the lads. We hadn't lost a qualifier in a decade which is unbelievable. Hopefully this is a blessing in disguise.\n\nThe Everton man was left demoralised after Czech Republic took a late victory in Prague\n\n'We all play well for our clubs and get picked for England because of that. Everyone is fighting for positions. I don't think (the goals) are a concern.\n\n'I hate getting beaten, I hate conceding goals. It was a missed opportunity but we will bounce back and learn from it. It is about keeping a clean sheet as a collective.\n\n'Everyone knows about the attacking ability and depth we have got. Qualification is still there for us.'", "description": "DOMINIC KING IN SOFIA: Jordan Pickford has claimed that England's ambition is to have the best defence in Europe, and demanded they take the first step towards that target in Bulgaria.", "authors": ["Dominic King For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/22/19666980-0-image-a-54_1571001523134.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
