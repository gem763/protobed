Last year\u2019s concert was devoted to another favorite theme of Pope Francis, the issue of migrants and refugees.\n\nOne of the organizers of the event, the Scholas Occurrentes Foundation, is endeavoring to engage the students from the 450,000 schools in its network in reforestation activities as well as in \u201crebuilding a harmonious rapport between nature and humanity.\u201d\n\nAlong with the aforementioned performers, the concert will also feature Scottish artist Susan Boyle, the Italians Elisa, Simone Cristicchi, Fabio Rovazzi, Noemi, Davide Merlini, Giorgio Albiani, and Fabio Armiliato. The Italian Cinema Orchestra will be conducted by Maestro Renato Serio and Maestro Adriano Pennino, and a Gospel choir from the USA will also play, as well as the Corps Band of the Vatican Gendarmerie.\n\nThe Vatican has been holding its annual Christmas concert at the Paul VI Audience Hall since 1993, playing host to a broad range of Italian and international music artists.\n\nOver the years, representatives of diverse genres have graced the Vatican hall, including Patti Smith, Annie Lennox, Al Jarreau, Andrea Bocelli, B.B. King, Bryan Adams, Bryan Ferry, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Gloria Gaynor, Tom Jones, and Sarah McLachlan.\n\nIn 2003, the concert was interrupted by soul artist Lauryn Hill, who seized the opportunity to lecture the prelates present on the issue of clerical sex abuse.\n\n\u201cI am sorry if I am about to offend some of you,\u201d Hill told the 7,000 guests at the concert. \u201cI did not accept my invitation to celebrate with you the birth of Christ. Instead I ask you why you are not in mourning for him in this place?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to ask you, what have you got to say about the lives you have broken?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat about the families who were expecting God and instead were cheated by the Devil?\u201d\n\n\u201cHoly God is a witness to the corruption of your leadership, of the exploitation and abuses which are the minimum that can be said for the clergy. There is no acceptable excuse to defend the church,\u201d she said.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The Vatican announced artists including Lionel Ritchie and Bonnie Tyler will be playing at its annual Christmas concert on Dec. 14.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
