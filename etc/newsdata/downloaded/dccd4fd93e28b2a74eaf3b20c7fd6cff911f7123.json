I think with mental health, you have to be very careful what words you use but that was the story I found and it seemed the right journalistic thing to do, to tell that story as empathetically as I could.\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\n\"You know as well as I do as a journalist, there are different moments and that just felt like the approach I should take on this occasion.\"\n\nThe documentary has caused a huge debate around the world, with many praising the couple for speaking so honestly about subjects not normally addressed by members of the royal family.\n\nBut others have criticised them for \"moaning\" from such a place of privilege, especially while in a country like South Africa.\n\nInsiders claim William and other members of the royal family are extremely worried about Meghan and Harry after seeing the show, adding that the breakdown in the brothers' relationship was \"desperately sad\".\n\n(Image: Ian Vogler / Daily Mirror)\n\nThey said: \"They\u2019re going completely separate ways and Harry is the one who seems to be visibly struggling.\n\n\u201cIt seems the boy who walked behind their mother\u2019s coffin, which is so vividly seared onto the nation\u2019s consciousness, has never fully recovered, which is an utter tragedy.\n\n\"Charles has sought to help the young men, even that hasn\u2019t helped.\n\n\u201cMany inside the family have said how seeing her sons drifting apart would be the last thing Diana would have wanted.\u201d", "description": "Tom Bradby spoke to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry about a number of serious issues including mental health and the pressures of royal life for his TV documentary Harry and Meghan: An African Adventure", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Twitter", "Ian Vogler", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20661999.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/5_Screen-Shot-2019-10-17-at-174719.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
