Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu described it as a pause, solely to allow the Kurdish fighters to withdraw.\n\nKurdish fighters would be forced to give up their heavy weapons and their positions would be destroyed, Cavusoglu said. He declined to call the agreement a \u201cceasefire\u201d, saying ceasefires could be agreed only by legitimate sides, and not by a Kurdish militia that Turkey considers a terrorist group.\n\n\u201cWhen the terrorist elements completely leave the safe zone, we can stop the operation,\u201d Cavusoglu said.\n\nWashington and Ankara will cooperate to handle Islamic State (IS) fighters and their families held in prisons and camps, the joint statement said, addressing concerns that the militant group might reconstitute and again attack Western targets.\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUT KURDISH RESPONSE\n\nPence said Washington had already been in contact with the Kurdish-led SDF, which had agreed to withdraw and were already pulling out.\n\nHowever, the Kurdish position was not clear. Speaking to Ronahi TV, SDF commander Kobani said the agreement is \u201cjust the beginning\u201d and will not achieve Turkey\u2019s goals.\n\nAldar Xelil, a leading Syrian Kurdish politician, told Al Arabiya television that the Kurds would abide by the ceasefire but would defend themselves.\n\nPence said that once the pause became permanent, Washington would go ahead with its own plans to withdraw its forces from northern Syria, which had partnered with the Kurds to fight against Islamic State. However, there were no signs that U.S. forces had ceased their withdrawal, a U.S. official said.\n\nTrump tweeted: \u201cGreat news out of Turkey\u201d.\n\n\u201cThank you to Erdogan,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMillions of lives will be saved!\u201d\n\n\u201cToday the United States and Turkey have agreed to a ceasefire in Syria,\u201d Pence told a news conference after more than four hours of talks at the presidential palace in Ankara.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary meets with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan at the Presidential Palace in Ankara, Turkey, October 17, 2019. REUTERS/Huseyin Aldemir\n\n\u201cThe Turkish side will pause Operation Peace Spring in order to allow for the withdrawal of YPG forces from the safe zone for 120 hours,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAll military operations under Operation Peace Spring will be paused, and Operation Peace Spring will be halted entirely on completion of the withdrawal.\u201d\n\nThe deal struck with Erdogan also provided for Turkey not to engage in military operations in the flashpoint Syrian border town of Kobani, Pence said. Cavusoglu said Turkey had given no commitments about Kobani.\n\nU.S. Special Representative for Syria Engagement James Jeffrey said the agreement covered central northeastern Syria and Turkey was in separate talks with the Russians and the Syrians about other parts of the region.\n\n\u201cWe have a very (convoluted) situation with Russian, Syrian Army, Turkish, American, SDF and some Daesh (Islamic State) elements all floating around in a very wild way,\u201d he told pool reporters as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo flew to Tel Aviv from Ankara.\n\nHUMANITARIAN CRISIS\n\nSenator Mitt Romney, a Republican, said the agreement \u201cis far from a victory\u201d and demanded the administration explain what will happen to the Kurds, what will be the future U.S. role in the region and why Turkey \u201cwill face no apparent consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat President Trump agreed to today is a capitulation to Turkey at the expense of our Kurdish allies,\u201d Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, said in a statement, saying \u201cthe agreement lets Turkey off the hook for slaughtering innocent civilians.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish assault has created a new humanitarian crisis in Syria with 200,000 civilians taking flight, a security alert over thousands of Islamic State fighters potentially abandoned in Kurdish jails, and a political maelstrom at home for Trump.\n\nThe Turkish assault began on Oct. 9 after Trump moved U.S. troops out of the way after an Oct. 6 phone call with Erdogan. Trump announced sanctions on Turkey on Monday, after the assault began, but critics said these were too little, too late.\n\nPence said the sanctions would be lifted once the ceasefire became permanent.\n\nIf successful, the deal could smooth over a major rift between Washington and Turkey, the only Muslim NATO ally.\n\nSlideshow (21 Images)\n\nBut the U.S. withdrawal also leaves U.S. adversaries Russia and Iran in a far stronger position in Syria. The Kurds responded to the U.S. withdrawal by effectively switching allegiances and inviting Syrian government forces, backed by Moscow and Tehran, into towns and cities in areas they control.\n\n\u201cThe United States essentially agreed to everything Turkey was seeking: a green light to invade, the creation of a huge \u2018safe zone\u2019 that Kurdish fighters have to leave, and the end of Kurdish autonomy,\u201d said Phil Gordon, an Obama administration official now at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\u201cDeeply damaging to U.S. credibility, not just because Trump betrayed the Kurds but because it once again makes Trump look like a paper tiger: after all his big threats to Turkey he gave it everything it wanted for almost nothing in return,\u201d Gordon said.", "description": "Turkey agreed on Thursday to pause its offensive in Syria for five days to let Kurdish forces withdraw from a \"safe zone\" Ankara had sought to capture, in a deal hailed by the Trump administration and cast by Turkey as a complete victory.", "authors": ["Humeyra Pamuk", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442091535&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1K5", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
