Scroll down for a photographic feast for the eyes.\n\nThis image by British photographer Jonathan Banks, taken in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, is the overall winner of the 2019 Siena International Photo Awards contest. Called A Boy In The Crowd, it shows a child in a festival crowd guarded by armed soldiers trying to retrieve his ball. Banks, an award-winning professional photographer and British Red Cross volunteer, said: 'At this particular three-day festival on the outskirts of Monrovia in 2008, the crowd was tens of thousands strong. I started by photographing the soldiers, but then changed to what was more interesting in the crowd. I had been circling this particular soldier, when suddenly out of the crowd leaned this boy reaching for his precious ball, scared of soldiers and their guns. This all happened in the blink of an eye and resulted in this picture, which seems to represent the precariousness of peace, as seen through the eyes of a young child with little understanding of the greater dynamics at play. All he knew was, he wanted his ball back, but also to stay safe'\n\nSurfing monster waves up to 100ft high is one extreme activity in Nazar\u00e9 in Portugal, another is clipping into a safety harness and walking along a rope fixed between a lighthouse and a rocky outcrop as the Atlantic Ocean rages all around.
