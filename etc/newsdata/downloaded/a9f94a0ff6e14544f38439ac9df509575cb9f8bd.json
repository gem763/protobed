Local stories from several of the largest U.S. cities will also make the grade; headlines from smaller towns are on their way, Facebook says.\n\nTapping on those headlines will take you directly to publisher websites or apps, if you have any installed. Which is more or less what publishers have been requesting from Facebook for years.\n\nIt\u2019s potentially a big step for a platform that has long struggled with both stamping out misinformation and making nice with struggling purveyors of news. Though media watchers remain skeptical that Facebook is really committed to helping sustain the news industry.\n\nFacebook declined to say who is getting paid and how much, saying only that it will be paying \u201ca range of publishers for access to all of their content.\u201d Just last year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wasn\u2019t sure it \u201cmakes sense \u201d to pay news outlets for their material.\n\nBut now, as Zuckerberg told The Associated Press in an interview, \u201cthere\u2019s an opportunity to set up new long term, stable financial relationships with publishers.\u201d\n\nNews executives have long been unhappy about the extent to which digital giants like Facebook make use of their stories - mostly by displaying headlines and short summaries when users post news links. A bipartisan bill introduced in Congress this year would grant an antitrust exemption to news companies, letting them band together to negotiate payments from the big tech platforms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good direction that they\u2019re willing for the first time to value and pay for news content,\u201d said David Chavern, head of the News Media Alliance, a publisher trade group. \u201cThe trouble is that most publishers aren\u2019t included.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg said Facebook aims to set up partnerships with a \u201cwide range\u201d of publishers.\n\n\u201cWe think that this is an opportunity to build something quite meaningful here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have journalists curating this, we are really focused on provenance and branding and where the stories come from.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Los Angeles Times said it expects the Facebook effort will help expand its readership and digital subscribers.\n\nFacebook killed its previous effort to curate news, the ill-fated Trending topics, in 2018. Conservatives complained about political bias, leading Facebook to fire its human editors and automate the section until it began recycling false stories, after which the social giant shut it down entirely.\n\nBut what happens when the sprawling social network plays news editor? An approach that sends people news based on what they\u2019ve liked before could over time elevate stories with greater \u201cemotional resonance\u201d over news that \u201callows public discourse to take place,\u201d said Edward Wasserman, dean of the graduate journalism program at the University of California-Berkeley.\n\n\u201cIt deepens my concern that they\u2019ll be applying Facebook logic to news judgment,\u201d he added.\n\nThe social network has come under criticism for its news judgment recently. In September, it removed a fact-check from Science Feedback that called out an anti-abortion activist\u2019s video for claiming that abortion is never medically necessary. Republican senators had complained about the fact check.\n\nFacebook says a small team of \u201cseasoned\u201d journalists it employs will choose the headlines for the \u201cToday\u2019s Story\u201d section of the tab, designed to \u201ccatch you up\u201d on the day\u2019s news. The rest of the news section will be populated with stories algorithmically based on users\u2019 interests.\n\nThat sounds similar to the approach taken by Apple News, a free iPhone app. But Apple\u2019s effort to contract with news organizations has been slow to take off. Apple News Plus, a $10-a-month paid version, remains primarily a hub for magazines; other news publishers have largely sat it out.\n\nApple\u2019s service reportedly offered publishers only half the revenue it pulled in from subscriptions, divided according to how popular publishers were with readers.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Over the course of its 15 year history, Facebook has variously ignored news organizations while eating their advertising revenue, courted them for video projects it subsequently abandoned, and then largely cut their stories out of its newsfeeds .", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barbara Ortutay", "Tali Arbel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/25/facebook_news_tab_82382_c0-64-3053-1844_s1200x700.jpg?d0e9a7e6f1592171ad13ef3f908cd74494fac168", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
