Rather, it is designed to be a precision tool for shooters. To that end, Sig Sauer worked to shift weight from one part of the pistol to another, to provide a trigger that\u2019s smooth and predictable, and to outfit the gun with a front sight that is easy to find and, therefore, lends itself to quick target acquisition.\n\nThe grip on the XFive is Tungsten-infused, for additional weight in the hand. This is coupled with cut-outs in the slide\u2013for weight reduction in that part of gun\u2013together with solid steel guide rod and heavy duty spring. The result? A tremendous reduction in felt recoil and muzzle flip reduced by \u201cup to 50 percent.\u201d\n\nThe XFive is a designed with competition shooters in mind, but is also a fine choice for anyone who is honed in on precision during their time at the range.\n\nThis is a pistol that allows a fair shot, like myself, to shoot at much higher level right out of the box.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
