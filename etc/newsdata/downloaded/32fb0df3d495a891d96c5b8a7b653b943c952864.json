(Unless we\u2019re talking about the Wisconsin old fashioned, which is an entirely different situation.) If you\u2019re looking to ease your way into bourbon-focused cocktails with a little southern charm, consider looking to the 1930s with the Kentucky River.\n\nI can\u2019t find a verified history of exactly who or where this cocktail was first made, but it appears in at least one cocktail book from the 1930s.\n\nIt\u2019s as easy to make as any old fashioned, but the sugar is replaced with cr\u00e8me de cacao, and classic angostura bitters are swapped out for peach bitters. It\u2019s a touch more dessert-like than its classic counterpart, but still quite boozy, and completely delicious. To make it, you will need:\n\n60mL bourbon\n\n15mL cr\u00e8me de cacao\n\n3 dashes of peach bitters\n\nAdd everything to a lowball with a great big cube and give it a little stir. Garnish with a strip of lemon zest if you need a garnish (and are ok with upping your ingredient count).", "description": "Most old fashioneds have a little sugar, either by way of cube or syrup, but it\u2019s not what I\u2019d call a \u201csweet\u201d cocktail.
