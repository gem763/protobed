The rest of the demonstration passed without issue.'\n\nThe protest is believed to have been organised by the paedophile hunter group Predator Awareness, who posted the protest on Facebook and gained over 2,400 shares.\n\nThey were not available for comment.\n\nEarlier this month, George was photographed enjoying the sunshine outside hostel for the first time since her controversial release from jail two weeks ago.\n\nIn July, a Parole Board panel cleared her for release, saying she was no longer a \u2018significant risk to the public\u2019 despite pleas to keep her behind bars\n\nVanessa George, 49, looked relaxed, wearing a navy blue top, grey shorts and black slip-on shoes.

No one had a clue who she was until a few days in.\n\n\u2018She spent a lot of time in the yard outside when it was warm, lapping up the sunshine and laughing and joking.\u2019 The source added: \u2018She didn\u2019t come across as the type who\u2019s too troubled by what she was banged up for.\u2019\n\nThe photos show that her hair is now a natural mousey blonde. And she looks relaxed, wearing a navy blue top, grey shorts and black slip-on shoes.\n\nFollowing her release from prison, the mother of one victim wrote a heartbreaking open letter to George. She told how her crimes had left her family with a \u2018legacy of pain\u2019.\n\nThe mother said her child, who has had to have counselling, is aged 13 but still wets the bed and has never had a sleepover at a friend\u2019s house. \u2018It\u2019s not fair that you get to move on now and start a fresh life and we are left to continue suffering,\u2019 she added.\n\nEven George\u2019s own family say that she should not have been released. One member, who did not want to be named, told the Daily Mail: \u2018It might have been easier to just lock her up and throw away the key. She\u2019s clearly not a decent member of society.\u2019", "description": "Protestors attempted to swarm Crowley House Probation Hostel in Selly Oak, Birmingham yesterday to demonstrate against prolific paedophile Vanessa George.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/12/19953610-0-image-a-2_1571571250482.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
