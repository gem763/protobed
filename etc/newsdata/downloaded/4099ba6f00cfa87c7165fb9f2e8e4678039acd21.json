Bernie Sanders said in a recent interview that China has done more for poverty eradication than America \u2014 more \u201cthan any country in the history of civilization,\u201d in fact.\n\nWow. Talk about throwing America under the bus. And in such ignorant fashion, to boot.\n\nHere\u2019s what he said, in an interview with Krystal Ball of Hill.TV: \u201cChina is a country that is moving unfortunately in a more authoritarian way in a number of directions. But what we have to say about China in fairness to China and its leadership is if I\u2019m not mistaken they have made more progress in addressing extreme poverty than any country in the history of civilization, so they\u2019ve done a lot of things for their people.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s unwind.\n\nFirst off, \u201cin fairness to China and its leadership\u201d \u2014 why? Why do we have to be fair to tyrants and communists? So we don\u2019t offend them? Geesh.\n\nSecond off, as much as China has indeed made gains in reducing poverty in recent years, the point is: China is communist. And corrupt. And oh yes, hmm, let\u2019s see \u2014 communist.\n\nAmerica is not China.\n\nAmerica is not a country with an authoritarian government, with leaders who are free to control the economy as they see fit \u2014 disbursing dollars here, commanding higher wages there.\n\nRegistering citizens in government databases here and there.\n\n\u201cBy registering the poor on a national database, the government [of China] is able to effectively monitor and implement domestic strategies,\u201d The Borgen Project reported, in its \u201cPoverty Reduction Strategies in China\u201d post. \u201cThis registration system also allows for a more targeted approach.\u201d\n\nWould Sanders have the poorest of America register likewise?\n\nHere\u2019s another point to consider: Poverty in China means dying from starvation. Poverty in America means possessing only one television.\n\nAnd guess why that is.\n\nBecause America is the land of opportunity, the country of freedom, the nation of pulling oneself up by one\u2019s bootstraps to achieve great things. In a word: capitalist. In another word: free.\n\nChina\u2019s economy is controlled. It also rates among the world\u2019s worst in terms of income inequality \u2014 meaning the very, very rich skew some of the economic statistics, painting in some reports a rosier picture than reality.\n\nAmerica\u2019s economy is a free market.\n\nIt\u2019s an apples to prison bars analogy.\n\nChina in 2016 ranked No. 144 on the Index of Economic Freedom, behind Brazil, India and Pakistan. Hong Kong, land of shining capitalism, on the other hand, ranked first. America that same year came in at No. 11.\n\nWhich means that Sanders ought to rethink his whole pro-commie, anti-capitalistic view. If anything, when it comes to the economy, it would seem China could learn a thing or two from America.\n\nBut that\u2019s the problem with socialists such as Sanders: They\u2019re blind to truths; bonkers to control. And if it means destroying freedoms and nations in the process, so be it.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
