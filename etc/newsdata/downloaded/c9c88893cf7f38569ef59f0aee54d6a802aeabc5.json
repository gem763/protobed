Weeks after they were set free, three of the five birds disappeared over moors.\n\nCurrently, the endangered bird of prey faces threats from illegal persecution, as it is poached to protect grouse.\n\nThe RSPB has criticised the scheme, asking Natural England to focus its efforts on wildlife crime rather than \"meddling\" with wild birds.\n\nA spokesperson for the bird charity added: \u201cThe RSPB has made it very clear that the idea that brood management is about helping hen harriers was a nonsense.\n\n\u201cThe tragic disappearance of three harriers from Natural England\u2019s brood management scheme over grouse moors in England only serves to underline this point. The only reason there are so few hen harriers on our uplands is because of illegal persecution. Stop this, and the birds may have a chance. But if it continues, no matter what schemes are cooked up, then these birds will never return. And that is a national disgrace.\u201d", "description": "Natural England has been criticised after three of the five hen harriers it attempted to protect by raising them in captivity before releasing them into the wild have disappeared and are presumed to be dead.", "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Allister Heath", "Sherelle Jacobs", "Stephen Bush"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000066066711-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwQSLAVq99dI0mw5i7f8C4rA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
