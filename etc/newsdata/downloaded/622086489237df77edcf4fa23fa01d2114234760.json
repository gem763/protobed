But the implicit categorisation of all these fires as \u201cwildfires\u201d or even just \u201cbad\u201d fires hides the fact that fire is also used sustainably in the region. In fact, for numerous smallholders and Indigenous peoples, it is part of their livelihood and cultural practices.\n\nThe Amazon isn\u2019t one continuous block of lush rainforest as in the Western imagination, but rather a landscape of multiple ecosystems including forest, wetlands and savannas. Indigenous and local communities use fire within these habitats in different ways.\n\nFor example, fire is used in small-scale rotational forest farming where typically half-hectare plots are cut, burned and planted for a number of years, before being left to regenerate. And in the fire-prone savanna, Indigenous people use fire to drive and trap game such as deer or the pig-like peccary.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

This reduces fuel loads, introduces natural firebreaks and limits the potential for catastrophic fires.\n\nFor many Indigenous groups in the Amazon, their entire way of life is predicated on sustainable fire. For example, the Meb\u00eangokr\u00ea (Kayap\u00f3) people, who live in a remote region of the Brazilian Amazon, use fire to hunt for tortoises. Fire is used to clear tall savanna grasses, thus making tortoise burrows more visible and accessible. Hunts like this form part of extended traditional festivals with implications for social processes including courtship, community cohesion, youth initiation and inter-generational knowledge transfer.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

bees before collecting honey and stimulating certain trees to fruit, as well as using fire to protect important areas such as sacred forests, farming plots and homes. For all these groups, fire intimately connects livelihoods, culture, history and beliefs.\n\nAnti-fire discourse\n\nIndigenous management has a wider impact: evidence from several satellite studies indicate that Indigenous lands have less deforestation and habitat conversion compared to surrounding areas. This means these areas are more biodiverse and store more carbon.\n\nYet, there is still a pervasive anti-fire discourse targeting Indigenous peoples and smallholders in the Amazon. In Venezuela, for example, the Indigenous Pem\u00f3n have been labelled with the derogatory phrase \u201cPemones los quemones\u201d (crudely translated as \u201cPem\u00f3n the pyromaniacs\u201d), and in Brazil there is a notion that Indigenous burning activities represent an inherently destructive mentality. This anti-fire rhetoric is widely used by interest groups in the Amazon, such as the powerful agribusiness lobby, to discredit Indigenous and local communities and as political narratives contesting rights to land.\n\nIt does not help that the satellite imagery currently used to monitor fires in the Amazon is typically 4km x 4km resolution \u2013 that is, it can only \u201csee\u201d in blocks of four kilometres. That means it cannot distinguish between small, controlled fires \u2013 perhaps only the size of a field, but large enough to trigger the satellite \u2013 and much larger wildfires.\n\nConflating distinct fire types \u2013 small, large, controlled, uncontrolled, intentional, accidental, sustainable, unsustainable \u2013 raises more problems. It impedes our understanding of the root causes of destructive wildfires, and aids the formulation of restrictive policies that further disempower already marginalised groups while giving more power and control to established hierarchies.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In a vast region with limited infrastructure, resources and on the ground enforcement, firefighting alone is not viable and not effective, today or in the future.\n\nAt the G7 summit, a group of wealthy nations pledged $22m (\u00a318.2m) for firefighting planes and military support to tackle the Amazon fires. But it\u2019s a top-down, sticking plaster approach. That money may be much better spent on strengthening Indigenous and local community land rights, while supporting local communities to share their fire knowledge with decision-makers in order to revalorise and implement traditional fire management grounded in local realities and a changing climate.\n\nJayalaxshmi Mistry is a professor of environmental geography at Royal Holloway, University of London.
