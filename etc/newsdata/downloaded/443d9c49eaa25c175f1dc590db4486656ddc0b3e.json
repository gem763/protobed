Studies suggest that the cognitive-boosting board game, which has endured around the world for more than 15 centuries, improves a child\u2019s visual memory, attention span, spatial-reasoning ability, critical thinking, mental discipline, creativity, math skills, and logical reasoning. One study found that children who played chess scored an average of 10 percentage points higher on reading scores than their peers who didn\u2019t play.\n\nIn the short documentary The Magic of Chess, which premieres on The Atlantic today, a cadre of pint-size chess champions reveals how the practice has enriched their lives. The director Jenny Schweitzer Bell shot the film on location at the 2019 Elementary Chess Championships, a high-stakes tournament held annually in Nashville. In attendance\u2014and interviewed in the film\u2014was Tani Adewumi, the 8-year-old Nigerian refugee who, while living in a homeless shelter with his family, beat elite-private-school kids in the New York Chess Championships.\n\nThe children interviewed in the film are articulate and wise beyond their years. \u201cWhen I asked the kids questions like, \u2018What has chess taught you?,\u2019 I was surprised, given their limited life experience, that they could formulate a response beyond the obvious mechanics of the game,\u201d Schweitzer Bell told me.\n\nChess \u201cteaches you how to make a plan,\u201d one child says in the film.\n\n\u201cWhen you lose, you learn from your mistakes,\u201d says another.\n\nJennifer Shahade, the program director of the Women in Chess Initiative and a chess champion herself, told me that the game\u2019s time-honored\u2014and generationally agnostic\u2014appeal lies somewhere in the delicate balance between the strategic long-term planning and immediate tactical creativity it requires. \u201cThe trick is knowing when to use which type of thinking,\u201d Shahade said. \u201cChess is a constant challenge where creativity meets rigorous analysis.\u201d", "description": "Meet pint-size future grand masters at the 2019 Elementary Chess Championships.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/09/Atlantic_Still3/video-featured.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
