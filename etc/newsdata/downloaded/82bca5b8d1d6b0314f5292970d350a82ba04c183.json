The judge called Trump\u2019s claims of immunity \u201crepugnant\u201d to the US Constitution.\n\nTrump immediately appealed and in less than two hours won a delay to give the federal appeals court in Manhattan time for expedited review. The delay postponed what would have been a Monday afternoon deadline for Mazars to begin turning over the records to prosecutors.\n\nThe ruling means that Trump is closer to losing control of his tax filings and other financial records after years of defying a modern presidential norm of disclosing them to the public.\n\nUS District Judge Victor Marrero rejected Trump\u2019s request for an injunction to block a grand jury subpoena for Trump\u2019s personal and business records, ruling that the case should have been filed in state court rather than federal court. But he also ruled against the president\u2019s constitutional claims, calling his argument for immunity from investigation \u201cvirtually limitless.\u201d\n\nTrump asserted broad claims of presidential immunity from criminal investigation, extending to his company and business associates as well. But the judge found the assertion overly broad and dismissed Trump\u2019s argument, saying it \u201cwould constitute an overreach of executive power.\u201d\n\nMarrero\u2019s ruling marked another crack in the legal wall Trump has constructed around his personal financial records. Two judges have already ruled against Trump in other federal cases involving his financial records, and the president is appealing those decisions. The stakes of the legal fight have only increased with the Democrats starting a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump assailed the ruling in a tweet shortly before the appeals court issued its temporary order.\n\nThe Radical Left Democrats have failed on all fronts, so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democrat prosecutors to go get President Trump. A thing like this has never happened to any President before. Not even close! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nEven if New York prosecutors obtain the financial records, the public won\u2019t see them. Lawyers from Vance\u2019s office told Marrero that New York law and legal ethics rules required them to keep the material secret. But information from the returns, or the documents themselves, could be used to develop cases or presented as evidence in a trial.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis court cannot endorse such a categorical and limitless assertion of presidential immunity,\u201d Marrero wrote in his ruling. \u201cThe expansive notion of constitutional immunity invoked here to shield the president from judicial process would constitute an overreach of executive power.\u201d\n\n\n\nHarry Sandick, a former federal prosecutor and partner at Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler in New York, said the ruling was clear.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe court was unwilling to accord the type of absolute immunity Trump\u2019s lawyers asked for,\u201d Sandick said. \u201cThe founders meant to give us a president, not a king.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf Trump loses in the federal court system, he could still try to block the subpoena by suing in state court, potentially drawing out the process. Mazars took no position in the case.\n\n\n\nVance is seeking evidence about hush payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who say Trump had extramarital trysts with them. Federal prosecutors last year charged Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, with coordinating payments to Daniels and McDougal at the direction of Trump, whom federal prosecutors famously referred to as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d in court papers.\n\n\n\nCohen pleaded guilty last year to campaign-finance violations, tax evasion, bank fraud and lying to Congress and is serving a three-year prison term. In a remarkable turnabout, the same Justice Department that prosecuted Cohen and labeled Trump as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d took preliminary steps this month to back Trump\u2019s argument that the president can\u2019t be investigated by state authorities.\n\n\n\nThe appeals court set October 21 as the soonest date it may hear arguments in the appeal. The court ordered Trump\u2019s legal team and lawyers from the Justice Department to file briefs by October 15. Vance has until October 17 to respond.\n\n\n\nJustice Department policy, dating back to 1973 and reaffirmed in 2000, holds that a sitting president can\u2019t be charged with a crime. But the policy doesn\u2019t address whether a sitting president can be investigated, or whether that protection extends to investigations by non-federal law enforcement agencies. And although that policy remains in effect, it hasn\u2019t been ruled on by a court or enacted into law by Congress.\n\n\n\nIn another case involving Trump\u2019s records, the House Ways and Means Committee is trying to get six years of his tax records from the Internal Revenue Service. Trump also sued separately to block a New York law that would let Congress get his state tax returns.\n\n\n\nTrump is also fighting subpoenas from other House committees that are trying to get financial information from Mazars, the president\u2019s accounting firm, and from his bankers at Deutsche Bank and Capital One Financial. Federal judges in New York and Washington have ruled against Trump in those two cases, and he\u2019s appealing.\n\n\n\nCongressional Democrats want to get hold of the records to investigate matters including Trump\u2019s possible business ties to Russia and potential violations of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses, which curbs a president\u2019s ability to take payments from foreign and domestic governments or officials.\n\n\n\nVance\u2019s investigation is focused on determining whether business records were falsified to hide the nature of the payments to Daniels and McDougal, which were made before the 2016 presidential election. The Justice Department has for decades taken the position that the Constitution protects presidents from being charged criminally while in office. But the question of whether he can be probed by state authorities has never been tested in court.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Vance declined to comment.", "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s accounting firm was ordered by a federal court to turn over his tax filings and other financial records to New York state prosecutors, though the president won a last-minute delay pending an emergency appeal.", "authors": ["Bob Van Voris", "Christian Berthelsen"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8991/023e60bbe62c45a0b0a0a24f8ee07a10.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
