Zelda reads all your letters but regrets that she cannot answer them all personally\n\nI can\u2019t stop thinking about my late first love\n\nI fell in love at 16 with a boyfriend I was with for three years. I moved on because of work, then met someone else and got married. I\u2019m 70 now and recently found out that my ex had died a few years ago. Since then I can\u2019t stop thinking about him \u2013 when I hear music that we both liked, it brings a tear and sadness. Am I being a selfish old lady? I had a good husband and family. I did see my ex at a party once with his wife and family, and he bought some drinks for me and my friends, but we didn\u2019t talk \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to intrude. I wish I had now.\n\nYou are not being selfish at all. It is perfectly all right and normal to have these feelings. I think that there are many things happening here. Sometimes a first love can have a really strong hold on the memory and often people tend to idealise it because feelings as a teenager can be so powerful. Perhaps you are also partly mourning your own lost youth \u2013 70 is not very old but it is not young either, and I think that remembering your ex-boyfriend also brings back memories of yourself at that age. It makes you aware of the time that has passed and all the dreams and aspirations you once had (and you may be sad if some of them didn\u2019t work out). Sometimes people feel the same kind of wistfulness when a famous pop star or actor who they admired dies. I wonder if you are also a little lonely. You say you had a good husband \u2013 I imagine you are now widowed and perhaps feeling a little unfulfilled. It is good to look back as well as forward, so instead of trying to bury these feelings, find a friend who you can really confide in \u2013 perhaps someone who also knew your ex well. Tell them all about your first love and the good times you shared. But also make sure that you plan plenty of fun things to do: see your family and friends, and maybe take up some hobbies, as learning new things at any age is a great distraction. I can understand that you feel sad about not speaking to your ex, but think of it this way: he may have been slightly unhappy in his marriage at the time (or perhaps you were) and he might have still harboured feelings for you (or vice versa), so if you had talked to him, maybe you would both have wanted to rekindle a friendship or more. That could have got very complicated. Buying you and your pals some drinks may have been his way of saying that he remembered you fondly and was glad to see you happy. Cherish those memories rather than feel guilty.\n\nHow do I tell my cousin to give me some space?\n\nI have always been fond of my younger cousin, but now she is leaning on me for advice all the time \u2013 it\u2019s wearing me down because I have problems of my own. She is 33 and desperate to find a partner and have children, but has been single for about five years. She is quite lonely and doesn\u2019t have many friends. She keeps wanting to come round every weekend but all she does is moan and, to be honest, my marriage is a little shaky at the moment. We are struggling with our very demanding teenage daughter (we also have an 11-year-old son), so my husband and I desperately need any time we can get to ourselves.\n\nI expect you haven\u2019t told your cousin that you are having a difficult time at the moment. You need to explain that you love her and want to help, but that you and your husband need some time alone. Also tell her very gently that her negative mindset is not helping her to make friends or find a partner. Suggest that she needs more help than you can give and that she could try counselling by contacting Relate (relate.org.uk) or the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (bacp.co.uk). You could also suggest that she reads The Science of Self Talk: How to Increase Your Emotional Intelligence and Stop Getting in Your Own Way by Ian Tuhovsky. Maybe instead of her coming round at weekends, you could do an exercise class or a sport with her on a weekday evening. It would probably make her feel better \u2013 and give her less time to moan.", "description": "I fell in love at 16 with a boyfriend I was with for three years.
