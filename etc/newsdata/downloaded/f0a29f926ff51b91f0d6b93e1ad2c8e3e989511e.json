She left the Trump administration shortly before the 25 July call with Mr Zelensky.\n\nA rough transcript of the call released by the White House shows Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky to investigate Mr Biden, now a Democratic frontrunner for next year's White House election.\n\nBut Mr Trump denies any wrongdoing, or that he withheld military aid in order to pressure Ukraine.\n\nWhat did Hill testify?\n\nFiona Hill's testimony, as reported by the New York Times, Politico and NBC News, revealed what Mr Bolton thought of an effort by some White House officials to pressure Ukraine.\n\nMs Hill said Mr Bolton told her to discuss the matter with the top lawyer at the National Security Council after he had a testy exchange on 10 July with Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU.\n\nMr Sondland was involved in the Ukraine pressure campaign, along with Mr Giuliani. Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, was also seen as a key player, according to Ms Hill's testimony.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Who is Rudy Giuliani?\n\nMr Bolton, who left the White House in September, said he wanted no part in their scheme, Ms Hill told lawmakers.\n\n\"I am not part of whatever drug deal Rudy and Mulvaney are cooking up,\" Ms Hill said Mr Bolton told her, according to Politico. The New York Times reports the same line but says Ms Hill said Mr Bolton referred to Mr Sondland and Mr Mulvaney, not Mr Giuliani and Mr Mulvaney.\n\nResponding to the testimony on Monday, Mr Giuliani said, \"I don't know Fiona and can't figure out what she is talking about\", according to the Washington Post.\n\nWho else has been called to testify?\n\nLast week Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, told lawmakers she was sacked over \"unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives\".\n\nMs Yovanovitch said she was \"incredulous\" at being dismissed by President Trump in May. The decision to dismiss her reportedly followed Mr Giuliani and other conservatives arguing she was biased against the president.\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Marie Yovanovitch (centre) arrives for a closed-doors deposition\n\nEarlier this month, House Democrats also heard from former US special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker.\n\nBefore he testified, Mr Volker handed over text messages between US diplomats documenting the Trump administration's efforts to have Ukraine investigate the energy company that employed Mr Biden's son when his father was Barack Obama's vice-president.\n\nLast week, Mr Sondland confirmed he would comply with a House subpoena to face the Democratic-led committees on 17 October.\n\nMr Sondland's first scheduled appearance earlier in the week was blocked by his bosses at the Department of State.\n\nWhat's the inquiry about?\n\nAccording to the whistleblower's complaint, some aides were concerned Mr Trump was soliciting interference from a foreign government for his own personal political interests during his 25 July call with President Zelensky.\n\nDemocrats have accused Mr Trump of withholding US aid while urging Ukraine to investigate corruption claims against his rival, 2020 Democratic contender Mr Biden and his son, Hunter, who worked with a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nOfficials in Kiev have said there is no evidence to support the allegations, which the Biden camp calls a smear.\n\nThe president denies any wrongdoing and Mr Zelensky also said there was \"no blackmail\" in the phone call.\n\nHunter Biden has given an interview, due to air Tuesday, where he has addressed the row.\n\n\"I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That's where I made the mistake,\" he told ABC News.\n\n\"So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.\"", "description": "John Bolton likened the lawyer's efforts to pressure Ukraine to a \u201cdrug deal\u201d, lawmakers hear.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/938D/production/_109237773_057304794-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
