The book is a wrenching and intimate story of sexual assault, survival, self-discovery, trauma, family, and friendship. It\u2019s a beautiful, revealing self-portrait. It\u2019s funny, and it\u2019s heartbreaking, and it\u2019s an inspiration.\n\nThere\u2019s just no other way to say it: The writing is exquisite. Describing a drunk voicemail she left her boyfriend the night of the assault, she wrote: \u201cThe words were indistinguishable, my voice sliding like butter in a hot pan, dragging from one to the next.\u201d\n\nThe memoir is also an indictment of the criminal justice system, of former Judge Aaron Persky\u2014who was recalled after controversy erupted over the short sentence\u2014and of the case\u2019s media coverage, which often featured glowing quotes about Turner\u2019s soft-spoken manners and impressive swimming career alongside grisly details of the assault.\n\nFrom the moment she woke up in the hospital, Miller tried to protect everyone in her life\u2014her sister, her boyfriend, her friends, her parents\u2014from what Turner had done to her. Of course, that was impossible, but her sincere efforts make for some of the most touching moments in the book.\n\n\u201cEvery time it rained, my dad said, \u2018The plants must be so happy!\u2019 How would it feel when he\u2019d learn his daughter had been raped?\u201d she wrote. \u201cI would\u2019ve wanted someone to have looked me in the eye, lowered their voice, gently laid their hand on mine. Perhaps I could do this for them.\u201d\n\nThe next morning\u2014after she told them, then collapsed into her mother\u2019s arms\u2014she found a lemon pie on the counter.\n\n\u201cIn the hushed hours of morning while I\u2019d been sleeping, my dad had picked lemons from the backyard, boiled sugar and eggs over the stove, pressed fingertips into crust along the edge, sprinkled powdered sugar on top,\u201d Miller wrote.\n\n\u201cYou looked dead.\u201d\n\nBut the story really begins in January 2015, when Miller awoke in the hospital without underwear, her hair covered in thousands of pine needles, with dried blood on her hands. Around 4 a.m., two Swedish cyclists had found Turner on top of Miller\u2019s half-naked, unconscious body. They yelled at him, chased him down when he ran, and waited for police to arrive.\n\nWhen Miller\u2019s horrified dad saw the evidence photos in court, he told her \u201cyou looked dead,\u201d like \u201csomeone tried to toss a body into the dumpster and missed.\u201d\n\nPolice were vague when they first explained what happened, she wrote. Someone had been acting \u201chinky\u201d around her body, and \u201cthere is reason to believe you have been sexually assaulted,\u201d they told her.\n\n\u201cThere was subtext that something grave had happened,\u201d she wrote, but it didn\u2019t really click until the local news picked up the police report, in which the deputy wrote that she was found in the fetal position, with her polka-dot underwear on the ground nearby, her dress gathered up near her waist, entire buttocks uncovered and pubic area visible.\n\n\u201cI feel embarrassed on an airplane when I wake up and realize I\u2019ve been sleeping with my mouth open,\u201d she wrote of her horror when she realized that 16 men saw her naked that night.\n\n\u201cI counted: Peter (1), who chased Brock (2), Carl (3), who squatted beside me. Guys from the fraternity (4, 5, 6, 7), who called the police. One guy (8) had been seen standing and shining a light over my body, before fleeing the scene. Deputy Taylor (9) was dispatched, a guy (10) led him to me. Next came Deputy Sheriff Braden Shaw (11), partner Eric Adams (12). Followed by paramedic Shaohsuan Steven Fanchiang (13), his partner Adam King (14), pinching my fingernails until I briefly opened my eyes, responding to the pain before slipping back out,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201c He\u2019d force moans in my mouth, assign lecherous behavior, to shift the blame onto me. \u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole time I was lying there, left nipple out, ass bare, stomach skin folded, while polished shoes stepped on mulch around me,\u201d Miller wrote.\n\nTurner\u2019s defense centered around the argument that Miller had not just consented, but \u201cenjoyed\u201d the encounter. He told the jury that she orgasmed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d force moans in my mouth, assign lecherous behavior, to shift the blame onto me,\u201d Miller wrote.\n\nBut the jurors didn\u2019t believe him. They convicted Turner of three counts of felony sexual assault.\n\n\u201cGoodbye to becoming an orthopedic surgeon.\u201d\n\nMiller also described the sea of local and national news stories, about Turner\u2019s arrest and subsequent conviction, which mourned his long-lost future. Reporters quoted his sister\u2019s letter to the judge asking for a lenient sentence: \u201cGoodbye to the Olympics. Goodbye to becoming an orthopedic surgeon.\u201d\n\nWhen he was arrested, one outlet noted: \u201cIf convicted Turner, who raced in the London 2012 U.S. Olympic trials, could face up to 10 years in prison.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf my name came out, what would they even say?\u201d she asked, then wrote: \u201cChanel, who works a nine-to-five entry-level job, has never been to London.\u201d\n\nAn article in The Washington Post about the verdict included the lines: \u201cCritics argued that the jury was harsh on Turner and treated an ambiguous and alcohol-fueled moment with black-and-white certainty,\u201d and, \u201cWith sentencing June 2 and an appeal possible, Turner\u2019s once-promising future remains uncertain. But his extraordinary yet brief swim career is now tarnished, like a rusting trophy.\u201d\n\nMiller wrote: \u201cHis was still the notable loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not a question of if you will survive this, but what beautiful things await you when you do.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, Miller\u2019s story is a guide to the hard work of living with trauma and the slow pace of recovery. Her legal case began the day of the assault, and it didn\u2019t truly conclude until more than three years later in August 2018, when Turner\u2019s appeal was denied.\n\nDuring that time, she quit her job and moved to Providence, Rhode Island to take an art class. Then to Philadelphia, to live with her boyfriend. She was frustrated, and sad, and angry\u2014at Turner, at online commenters, at the epidemic of campus sexual assault, at street harassment, at the millions of slights that women must ignore and accept every day.\n\n\u201cWalking down the street was like being tossed bombs,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI fiddled with the wires, frantically defusing each one. Each time I was not sure which wire would cause it to detonate, tinkering while sweat ran down my forehead. Women are raised to work with dexterity, to keep their nimble fingers ready, their minds alert. It is her job to know how to handle the stream of bombs, how to kindly decline giving her number, how to move a hand from the button of her jeans, to turn down a drink.\u201d\n\n\u201c Many wrote to me saying they had been in my position before, wanted to show me who survivors become ... They gave me one thousand futures to grow into. \u201d\n\nShe spent those years in the thick of PTSD. She was depressed, she was anxious, she cried. She was unemployed and unable to sleep, afraid that being unconscious again would make her vulnerable to attack.\n\nBut through therapy, support from her family, the justice of the trial\u2014and then the injustice of the sentencing and then Internet fame\u2014and with the help of art and performing comedy and writing and gifts from strangers and elderly foster dogs, Miller slowly recovered.\n\n\u201cI survived because I remained soft, because I listened, because I wrote,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I huddled close to my truth, protected it like a tiny flame in a terrible storm.\u201d\n\nPeople all over the world sent her bicycle earrings to remind her of the men who saved her, a watercolor painting of a lighthouse for the symbol she hoped to embody, and chocolate bars, like the kind her grandmother slipped her during the two-week trial.\n\n\u201cMany wrote to me saying they had been in my position before, wanted to show me who survivors become, told me about their careers, their kids, caring partners,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is what your life can look like in ten, twenty years. They gave me one thousand futures to grow into.\u201d\n\nBut it was Miller\u2019s mother, an author who witnessed atrocities growing up during the Cultural Revolution in rural China, who made her realize: \u201cIt is not a question of if you will survive this, but what beautiful things await you when you do.\u201d\n\nThis book is the answer.", "description": "Chanel Miller's memoir tells of her extraordinary courage after surviving sexual assault by Brock Turner, and of those who reached out with support\u2014including the vice president.", "authors": ["Olivia Messer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569272591/190923-Messer-Know-my-name-tease_m8xvb7", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
