But its exposure, and the resultant scandal and house-cleaning at one of the world\u2019s most renowned academic institutions, was at least in part down to the bravery of one female whistle-blower.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joi Ito, former head of MIT\u2019s Media Lab.

Then three months into her job she was directed to \u201cwipe every trace of Epstein from the university\u2019s record\u201d.\n\nThat order was Swenson\u2019s first clue that the Media Lab\u2019s relationship with Epstein, who killed himself in a jailhouse suicide after being arrested on sex-trafficking charges in July, was highly sensitive to the institution. As it would turn out, the link was so sensitive that toxic fallout at the Media Lab has proven to far-ranging and ongoing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein gave millions to MIT.

He had previously claimed the lab only received $525,000 in Epstein donations and that had been just an \u201cerror in judgement\u201d.\n\nThis week, Brown University also announced the suspension of Peter Cohen, a fundraising director who reportedly helped cover up Epstein\u2019s connections when he was working as the Media Lab\u2019s director of development, despite MIT listing Epstein as \u201cdisqualified\u201d in its donor database.\n\nBrown claims the fundraising practices at MIT were \u201cauthorized by and implemented with the full knowledge of MIT central administration\u201d \u2013 a claim that the woman who blew the whistle on MIT finds hard to believe.\n\nThe Epstein scandal at MIT shows the moral bankruptcy of techno-elites Read more\n\nThe directive, Swenson recalls, came after Epstein gave a relatively small gift \u2013 \u201c50 or a hundred thousand dollars\u201d \u2013 to help restore a Rothko painting. Three months later he unexpectedly acknowledged the gift in a press release.\n\nHe was, Swenson believes, \u201cshowing Joi that he had to keep him happy\u201d. \u201cHe was saying to Joi, \u2018I can destroy you by telling people you know me.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were all frantic,\u201d Swenson recalls. \u201cThe MIT press office reached out to investigate. They were wanting to refute or play down what he\u2019d said. If it came out, Joi was ready to call Epstein to ask him to take it down.\u201d\n\nIn that event, the press release was not widely picked up so there was no need to spring into action.\n\nBut in the larger picture, Swenson said she finds Ito\u2019s denial that he ever saw anything suspicious over the course of his long friendship with Epstein, including trips to Epstein\u2019s homes in New York, the Caribbean and New Mexico \u201cimplausible\u201d.\n\nAccording to Swenson, who witnessed Epstein\u2019s visit to the lab accompanied by two eastern European \u201cassistants\u201d, Ito and his colleagues were \u201cat best complicit in denying a problem\u201d.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to think about the worst,\u201d she says. \u201cJoi spent time in Epstein\u2019s homes and regularly socialized with him. It felt like bringing these two women everywhere, especially to scientific meetings, was a distraction. And the idea that they thought nothing was underfoot is impossible to believe.\u201d\n\nSwenson now recognizes that Epstein was \u201cusing the lab as a social thing and he knew that academics would be weak for money\u201d. Beyond that,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s hard to think further.\u201d\n\nI don't want to think the worst. Joi spent time in Epstein's homes and regularly socialized with him. And the idea that they thought nothing was underfoot is impossible to believe Signe Swenson\n\nSwenson says that a \u201csmall group of women in the office realized this was wrong, that this should not be happening, and that Epstein should not be running around MIT \u201d.The women had a name for Epstein: Voldemort.\n\nAfter working at the lab for three years, Swenson stepped away when, she says, \u201cshe realized her opinions and those of other women at the lab who had expressed discomfort at Epstein\u2019s visits and efforts to obscure his donation would not be heard.\n\n\u201cI realized that the job was never going to be what I wanted it to be,\u201d she concluded.\n\nSwenson first came forward to the New Yorker earlier this month. She produced emails that showed MIT had grossly underplayed the relationship with Epstein and the sums that he had given, or directed to be given, to the institution.\n\nThe university said that it received $800,000 from Epstein\u2019s foundations over 25 years. MIT president Rafael Reif, wrote, \u201cwith hindsight, we recognize with shame and distress that we allowed MIT to contribute to the elevation of his reputation, which in turn served to distract from his horrifying acts. No apology can undo that.\u201d\n\nIto disclosed that he had separately received $1.2m from Epstein for investment funds under his control, in addition to $525,000 he\u2019d donated to the lab.\n\nBut the New Yorker story blew that limited admission and apology out of the water. Reif called the relationship \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and announced a \u201cthorough and independent investigation\u201d by an outside law firm. Ito\u2019s resignation followed soon after.\n\nSwenson\u2019s decision to come forward, she says, came after Epstein was arrested in early July. She recognized that the discomfort she felt, specifically around the women Epstein brought with him to the lab, were well founded. She wondered if they had on some level been kidnapped.\n\n\u201cI thought: \u201cThank God he\u2019s been arrested\u201d. At last they can figure out how he\u2019s getting away with all this. When Epstein committed suicide I felt heartbroken for his victims. That\u2019s so convenient that the truth won\u2019t need to come out now.\u201d\n\nHer disgust mounted when she saw MIT\u2019s director of the Center for Civic Media, Ethan Zuckerman resign saying the lab\u2019s dealings with Epstein had compromised its values, followed by the weakness of Ito\u2019s admission and president Reif\u2019s letter essentially saying no one would be held to account.\n\n\u201cI fully saw MIT closing ranks, protecting their own, and letting out just enough information to apologize and offer some atonement \u2013 protect and hope the story died. They could just go on with the values of restorative justice that Joi had proposed.\u201d\n\nSwenson holds that the lab should return the full amount of money that came via Epstein.\n\n\u201cMoney is just the start,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of healing that needs to happen, for sure. But anything short of MIT being fully transparent is not good enough. Epstein is the extreme example but he\u2019s not the only bad actor.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s any explanation for the lapse in judgement, she says, it might be that MIT was in the midst of a campaign to raise $5bn \u2013 the largest of its history. \u201cThe pressure was on to meet that goal above all else,\u201d Swenson says.\n\nIf any good can come out of the MIT-Epstein debacle, Swenson hopes, it is that, with Ito gone, the faculty will be able to go through a \u201ctransition\u201d that will start when MIT starts listening to women in the faculty.\n\n\u201cI saw women at the lab speak out and their word meant nothing because Joi refused to admit the truth,\u201d Swenson says. \u201cFor those women who stuck around, I hope they are given some control and influence over the Media Lab and to shape it into something more equitable and safe. If they just start listening to the women it\u2019ll be a very different place.\u201d", "description": "Signe Swenson exposed the story of powerful men and millions of dollars in donations to the school\u2019s Media Lab", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/992784d5b4b55f7de8da8bdddb2783e62a01ea68/77_0_3710_2227/master/3710.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=69729744d99c7e3916a6674db45ef18c", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
