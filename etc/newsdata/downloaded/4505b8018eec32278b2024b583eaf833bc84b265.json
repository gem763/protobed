If, as a child, you have had to overcome abuse and discrimination, on one side it makes you a stronger personality. But on the other side it also leaves scars.\n\n\u201cToday Lewis has a good and mature perspective, but the scars are certainly there. That is not the only motivating factor for him \u2013 those scars are a witness of having survived.
