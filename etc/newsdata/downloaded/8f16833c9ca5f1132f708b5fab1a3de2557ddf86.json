Dickson's email said the FAA is working to provide regulators with \"useful information as you make your individual decisions on safely returning your fleets to service.\"\n\nThe meeting, to be held on Monday, is taking place in connection with the International Civil Aviation Organization World Aviation Forum.\n\nBoeing plans to revise the 737 Max software to take input from both angle-of-attack sensors in the MCAS anti-stall system linked to the two deadly crashes. It is not clear when Boeing will conduct a key certification test flight, a step needed before the FAA can return the plane to service.\n\nSome government officials do not believe Boeing will conduct that flight until October.\n\nThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency said last week it \"intends to conduct its own test flights separate from, but in full coordination with, the FAA. The test flights are not scheduled yet, the date will depend on the development schedule of Boeing.\"\n\nSeparately, a joint governmental review of the Boeing 737 Max that includes aviation regulators from around the world is expected to be released in the coming weeks. The review is expected to find places where regulations need to be harmonized internationally and where communications could be improved at the FAA and among international regulators, a person briefed on the matter said Tuesday.\n\nMajor U.S. airlines have canceled flights into December as a result of the Max grounding, including American Airlines and United Airlines , while Southwest Airlines has canceled flights into early January.", "description": "Reports of the briefing come a week after European regulators signaled they would not rely on the FAA's findings when Boeing submits its 737 Max fix.", "authors": ["David Shepardson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8152ac2e22af53cf709516-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
