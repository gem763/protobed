With a debut album that has struck a chord with a legion of female fans, Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O\u2019Connell is the biggest new star of 2019. Her UK tour next July has driven parents of teenage daughters into a frenzy in the scramble for tickets.\n\nBillie\u2019s older brother is part of the picture, too. Finneas O\u2019Connell co-writes and produces his 17-year-old sister\u2019s music, and accompanies her on tour playing guitar and keyboards.\n\nIt was a song he wrote and gave to Billie, Ocean Eyes, that kick-started her career when they recorded it in their childhood home in Highland Park and shared it online.\n\nBillie Eilish's older brother Finneas O\u2019Connell co-writes and produces his 17-year-old sister\u2019s music, and accompanies her on tour playing guitar and keyboards\n\nFinneas, 22, is striking out in his own right, too. The musician and actor, who played Alistair in the TV musical series Glee and has been co-writing with Latin star Camila Cabello, is releasing a seven-track mini-album of songs documenting the ups and downs of the past 18 months.\n\nBlood Harmony was made while Finneas was touring Europe with his sister this summer.\n\nLike singer-songwriter Jackson Browne\u2019s Running On Empty, it was put together in hotel rooms and on tour buses between concerts. Says Finneas: \u2018We\u2019d come offstage and I\u2019d run straight into my dressing room and get back to work.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s an assured solo bow. Billie doesn\u2019t sing here, but Blood Harmony complements her own material well. The lean electronics and resilient hooks of her chart- topping debut When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? were put in place by her brother rather than a middle-aged Svengali, and Finneas\u2019s sure-footed touch is evident again.\n\nFinneas, 22, is striking out in his own right, too. The musician and actor, who played Alistair in the TV musical series Glee and has been co-writing with Latin star Camila Cabello, is releasing a seven-track mini-album of songs documenting the ups and downs of the past 18 months\n\nHis songs fall roughly into two camps \u2014 McCartneyesque piano ballads and upbeat, digital pop. Of the former, Partners In Crime is a tender piece about camaraderie and I Lost A Friend addresses the impact of sudden fame.\n\n\u2018He don\u2019t need me because he made a little too much money to be 20 and sad,\u2019 sings Finneas against a backdrop of gospel handclaps and auto-tune. Is he talking of a former companion or parroting the reaction of others to his success? It\u2019s ambiguous, but still mightily effective.\n\nThe faster songs are clever and quirky. Shelter is punctuated by flamenco guitar rasgueados and, reiterating that Blood Harmony was made in Europe, I Don\u2019t Miss You At All namechecks F. Scott Fitzgerald while conjuring up images of an American abroad in Paris. It also nods towards the FM\u2011radio pop of Hall & Oates.\n\nWith his sister on the path to superstardom, Finneas may ultimately find his niche as a supportive backroom boy. But Blood Harmony \u2014 its title a reference to the pair\u2019s \u2018biological chemistry\u2019 \u2014 confirms there are additional strings to his bow.\n\nMika topped the charts with his debut album and was subsequently crowned best breakthrough act at the BRITs, but has largely disappeared from view since his fourth album No Place In Heaven in 2015.\n\nMIKA is now back with an album that revisits the theatrics of 2007\u2019s Life In Cartoon Motion. He is pictured here on stage at Party like a Deejay in Milan, Italy in June\n\nThe singer-songwriter, who was born in Beirut and raised in Paris before his parents moved to London when he was nine, has actually been hard at work outside the UK, maintaining his profile as a judge on The X Factor in Italy and The Voice in France while continuing to tour.\n\nHe\u2019s now back with an album that revisits the theatrics of 2007\u2019s Life In Cartoon Motion.\n\nWorking with Bastille producer Mark Crew and co-writers including former Fame Academy winner David Sneddon and Ed Sheeran associate Amy Wadge, his big-hearted songs are distinctive but can sometimes be overcooked. Tiny Love, built around a pounding piano, Bohemian Rhapsody guitars and lush harmonies, typifies his baroque extravagance. It\u2019s even reprised with strings and a children\u2019s choir.\n\nElsewhere, Stay High is a lively soul pastiche and Sanremo a sunny pop number in the style of Club Tropicana by Wham!.\n\nMika, 36, admits to having faced \u2018painful issues\u2019, and his personal songs resonate.\n\nReady To Call This Love is a potent duet with Jack Savoretti, while Paloma addresses the trauma of nearly losing his sister, who fell from a tall building in 2010, an incident so harrowing he has only been able to write about it now.\n\nMika plays Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, London, on November 10 (mikasounds.com)\n\nNICK CAVE & THE BAD SEEDS: Ghosteen (Ghosteen Ltd)\n\nRating:\n\nDescribed as a record about a wandering spirit, Cave\u2019s 17th album with his band is a double set.\n\nPart one consists of conventional songs illuminated by piano, strings and soft, falsetto vocals.\n\nPart two comprises a poem and two longer pieces. The accidental death in 2015 of Cave\u2019s teenage son Arthur isn\u2019t addressed directly, but the spectre of tragedy and an afterlife hangs over this compelling collection.\n\nDES\u2019REE: A Love Story (Stargazer)\n\nRating:\n\nShyness and stage fright drove Des\u2019ree Weekes away from music after 2003\u2019s Dream Soldier \u2014 she qualified as a nutritionist \u2014 but the London singer is looking to spark a mid-life career renaissance.\n\nMade with her established co-writers, A Love Story sticks to standard R&B and soul grooves. Fake It is lifted by smoky vocals and Love Me features an exquisite harmonica break.\n\nKIM GORDON: No Home Record (Matador)\n\nRating:\n\nIn Sonic Youth, the punk band she co-founded in the Eighties, guitarist Kim Gordon was New York cool epitomised.\n\nHer first solo album charts a similarly noisy path, with producer Justin Raisen\u2019s abrasive beats making it an uneasy listen.\n\nSketch Artist is a typically scratchy sound collage, while AirBnB is a playful paean to the modern hospitality economy.\n\nBACH: Organ Works (BIS BIS-2421, SACD)\n\nRating:\n\nThe organ here is the 1714 Gottfried Silbermann in Freiburg Cathedral and Hans Kipfer has captured its vast range superbly.\n\nMasaaki Suzuki\u2019s programme for his third organ volume takes in two Preludes and Fugues, a Fantasia and Fugue, a Toccata, beautiful Chorale Preludes and a Chorale Partita.\n\nHe finishes with the great Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor: the Passacaglia unfolds over a tread-like bass and the Fugue is one of Bach\u2019s greatest.\n\nBUSONI: Piano Concerto (Myrios Classics MYR024)\n\nRating:\n\nIf a 71-minute Piano Concerto does not turn you white at the gills, you may like to try this amazing monster.\n\nFerruccio Busoni wrote it in 1904 and this performance by Kirill Gerstein and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, with Sakari Oramo conducting, is terrific.\n\nOnly a few pianists have had the temerity to record the piece but Gerstein passes all his tests with honour.", "description": "ADRIAN THRILLS: These are exhilarating times for the O'Connell siblings of Los Angeles.
