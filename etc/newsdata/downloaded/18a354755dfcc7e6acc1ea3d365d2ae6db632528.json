Throughout their existence, congressional representatives from both sides of the aisle have supported them, recognizing their importance to land conservation, outdoor recreation and economic investment. Together, Republicans and Democrats have created a network of over 400 parks, landmarks, wild and scenic spaces, and historical sites, totaling over 85 million acres that provide a lifetime of memories for visitors and generate billions of dollars for our nation\u2019s economy.\n\nBut the bipartisan consensus to support our treasured National Park System is being undermined by a persistent and unprecedented effort from President Trump Donald John TrumpDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Trump adviser: 'He should stop saying things that are untrue' US moves British ISIS suspects from Syria amid Turkish invasion MORE and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to weaken protections for these special places, thus rendering them more vulnerable to fossil fuel companies looking to exploit our nation\u2019s natural resources for private gain.\n\nNow, the administration is turning their attacks towards their own federal employees, the men and women tasked with protecting our public lands, national parks and the millions of visitors they welcome every year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Department of the Interior (DOI) has made the misguided decision to reorganize the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and relocate senior officials from Washington, D.C. to Grand Junction, Colorado. This action effectively undermines the partnership between the National Park Service (NPS) and BLM officials who often work in close collaboration. This move also leaves BLM lands more vulnerable to industry and local officials looking to exploit America\u2019s rich natural resources for personal and corporate profit. In fact, BLM employees will now sit in the same office building in Grand Junction as oil companies like Chevron.\n\nDOI claims that this reorganization will allow BLM officials to better understand concerns in the field. This rationale is contradicted by a second move just announced by DOI, NPS superintendents around the country must notify Washington supervisors before issuing comments to other parts of the federal government, particularly those that concern energy extraction and industry development near national parks.\n\nNPS employees are hired based on their area of expertise. Their position descriptions and performance standards require them, among other things, to apply relevant laws and regulations, science and professional judgement while doing their jobs.\n\nIn addition, NPS employees assigned to comment on proposals from energy extraction industries must uphold the NPS Organic Act to leave parks \u201cunimpaired for future generations.\u201d When energy or other development could adversely impact park resources, NPS employees assigned to review these proposals must ensure no derogation of park resources would occur. This must be conducted professionally and without due influence from political agendas, both on a local and national level.\n\nYet, the administration is now calling for review of staff work by senior officials leaving park resources vulnerable to a political decision, not based on science and subject matter expertise.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis is hypocrisy. This administration is only concerned with hearing voices from the field when those voices support their pro-industry agenda. They do not want to hear the voices urging caution, those who speak up for the protection of our national parks and public lands. But these actions are consistent with a DOI \u2014 led by a former oil and gas lobbyist \u2014 who has enacted numerous and unprecedented rollbacks in environmental protections.\n\nThe attacks on our national parks and public lands by this administration, are part and parcel to a larger testing of our American values. We need to stand up and advocate for these irreplaceable natural and cultural resources. We need to defend the experts who are working to protect them. That\u2019s the only way we will preserve the things that matter most.\n\nSarah Bransom is a member of the executive council of the Coalition to Protect America\u2019s National Parks, an organization that represents over 1,700 current, former, and retired employees and volunteers of the National Park Service, with over 40,000 collective years of stewardship of America\u2019s most precious natural and cultural resources.
