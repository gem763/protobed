I didn't think it was going to come to the point where I'm in this situation now,\" he said.\n\nFolau is reportedly seeking Aus$10 million, including for lost sponsorship and marketing opportunities, in compensation.\n\nHe is cashed up after the Australian Christian Lobby raised more than Aus$2 million in just two days to help pay his legal fees.\n\nA trial has been set for February unless a court-ordered mediation in December is successful.", "description": "Former Wallabies star Israel Folau Saturday admitted he knew his social media post saying \"hell awaits\" gay people would be offensive.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9410/9b252d7d6d304980a83829d1ddf72965.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
