They can't win.\"\n\nGoodman added that he was an \"old traditionalist\" but added that \"if it's done in a tasteful way, I think it would be OK\".\n\nWelsh star Watkins, 43, will be joined on Dancing On Ice by celebrities including model Caprice Bourret, Love Island's Maura Higgins and TV presenters Trisha Goddard and Michael Barrymore.\n\nThey will all be judged on their moves by a panel including Jayne Torvill, Christopher Dean and new judge John Barrowman.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Ben Hunte, LGBT correspondent\n\nWhile some may see this as a gimmick, many LGBT people will see this as a necessary step to have their lives reflected on prime-time TV.\n\nFor a long time, heterosexual couples have been shown to be the norm. In adverts, films and television dancing competitions, straight pairings were all people saw. However, times really have changed.\n\nFor a prime-time family show to take this step is big, and it means that families up and down the country will be seeing and discussing same-sex pairings.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
