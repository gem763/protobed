It\u2019s not only to refuse to cooperate in the impeachment probe, but it\u2019s also practically to deny that Congress has any legitimate right to impeach President DONALD TRUMP -- period. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising. We\u2019ve been headed in this direction for a while now. It basically ensures the president will be impeached for interfering with the work of Congress.\n\nKYLE CHENEY and ANDREW DESIDERIO write that this will set up a \u201cconstitutional clash with Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the three committee chairs leading the impeachment probe, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone all but declared that the Trump administration will refuse to engage with a process it considers to be constitutionally invalid. \u2018Given that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the executive branch cannot be expected to participate in it,\u2019 Cipollone wrote.\n\n\u201cThe eight-page letter reads more like a political document than a legal one, echoing many of President Donald Trump\u2019s claims about the House Democrats who are investigating him. It also calls on Democrats to dismantle the process they set up to impeach Trump over allegations that he abused his power by pressuring Ukrainian leaders to help discredit his political rivals.\u201d POLITICO \u2026 The letter\n\n-- AP\u2019S JONATHAN LEMIRE, JIM MUSTIAN and MIKE BALSAMO: \u201cThe White House document, for its part, lacked much in the way of legal arguments, seemingly citing cable news appearances as often as case law. And legal experts cast doubt upon its effectiveness.\u201d AP\n\n\u2026 AND HERE IS HOW HOUSE REPUBLICANS plan to handle it. They are saying that House Intelligence Chairman ADAM SCHIFF and Speaker NANCY PELOSI -- a pair of California Democrats the GOP believes is unpopular with their base -- are trying to railroad a duly elected president just before an election. They are saying that Democrats are ignoring decades of precedent -- somewhat true, somewhat false -- to slag Trump. They won\u2019t even hold a vote to start the process of throwing him out, Republicans say -- even though it\u2019s not necessary.\n\nOF COURSE, this does not deal squarely with the substance: whether it is appropriate to invite foreign interference in American elections, and whether the president has done that. Nor does it deal with Trump turning the machinery of the U.S. government against JOE BIDEN, his main rival.\n\nBUT THIS IS THE GOP STRATEGY, and here is what you\u2019ll be hearing a lot of in the coming days. \u2026\n\n\u2026 HOUSE MINORITY LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY told us this Tuesday: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to undo the 2016 election, hold a vote for the American people to see. It\u2019s what Congress did for Nixon and Clinton. If Democrats rush an unfair process, we\u2019ll hit them every step of the way. They\u2019ve gone everything against what has been done in the past.\u201d\n\nNEW YORK GOP REP. LEE ZELDIN -- a close Trump ally who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee -- caught the eye of many in Trump\u2019s orbit Tuesday when he defended the president in front of the cameras in the Capitol. He told us this: \u201cIf there is going to be an impeachment inquiry, it should start with a vote by the full House, not by a press statement without a vote or any formal process. There should be minority subpoena power. The president should be allowed to have his counsel present at these depositions, to ask questions, present evidence, etc.\n\n\u201cALSO, THE SELECTIVE CHERRY-PICKING of information to leak, deliberately withholding numerous massively important facts, is disgusting. The Volker transcript should be released. It destroys Schiff\u2019s quid pro quo claim that President Trump issued a quid pro quo to President Zelensky that U.S. aid to Ukraine was linked to opening a corruption investigation against the Bidens. The Volker transcript blows a massive hole in the middle of that bogus charge.\u201d\n\n-- WSJ ED BOARD: \u201cImpeachment in Secret: Closed hearings and selective leaks won\u2019t persuade the public.\u201d\n\nGood Wednesday morning.\n\nA message from The Coalition Against Socialized Medicine: Nancy Pelosi\u2019s drug pricing proposal would put foreign bureaucrats in control of Americans\u2019 medicine cabinet, lead to access restrictions for America\u2019s patients, and stifle innovation, threatening the cutting-edge treatments and cures of tomorrow.

Now, he is trying to make lawlessness a virtue. The American people have already heard the president\u2019s own words \u2013 \u2018do us a favor, though.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s actions threaten our national security, violate our Constitution and undermine the integrity of our elections. The White House letter is only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the president is above the law.\u201d More from John Bresnahan, Heather Caygle and Sarah Ferris on Dems\u2019 strategy\n\nSHOT \u2026 SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-S.C.): \u201cIf Turkey moves into northern Syria, sanctions from hell \u2013 by Congress \u2013 will follow. Wide, deep, and devastating sanctions. \u2026 To the Turkish Government: You do NOT have a green light to enter into northern Syria.

The Turkish military, together with the Free Syrian Army, will cross the Turkish-Syrian border shortly.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- \u201cKurds mobilize in Syria as Turkey poised for imminent attack,\u201d by AP\u2019s Bassem Mroue in Beirut\n\nNEW \u2026 \u201cPoll: Half support impeaching and removing Trump,\u201d by Steven Shepard: \u201cHalf of voters support the impeachment and removal of President Donald Trump, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll. The poll, conducted Monday and Tuesday, shows that 50 percent of registered voters surveyed would support the Senate\u2019s removing Trump from office, while 43 percent oppose the president\u2019s removal. Seven percent of voters were undecided.\n\n\u201cThe 50 percent who support Trump\u2019s removal is identical to the percentage who approve of the intensifying impeachment inquiry into the president, and who would support the House\u2019s voting to impeach Trump. Similarly, 44 percent of voters oppose the inquiry, and 43 percent would oppose the House\u2019s impeaching the president.\u201d POLITICO\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

A palpable sense of concern had already taken hold among at least some in the White House that the call had veered well outside the bounds of traditional diplomacy, the officer wrote.\u201d NYT\n\n-- \u201cFormer national security officials fight back as Trump attacks impeachment as \u2018deep state\u2019 conspiracy,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s David Nakamura\n\nWHERE\u2019S MICK? -- \u201cThe shelter-in-place strategy to survive Trump\u2019s impeachment,\u201d by Nancy Cook and Gabby Orr: \u201cMick Mulvaney has gone noticeably quiet over the past week, just as the president\u2019s impeachment fight picks up. The White House\u2019s acting chief of staff has not appeared on any major TV shows to defend President Donald Trump, nor has he had any success in setting up an internal White House war room to respond to Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cInstead, the president\u2019s top aide has found his influence dwindling inside the West Wing as Trump faces the greatest threat to his presidency to date. It\u2019s the same place where Reince Priebus and Gen. John Kelly found themselves, despite each having a wildly different management style and philosophical approache to the chief of staff job. Trump sidelined all three of them, even after Mulvaney made nice with his family and adopted his \u2018let Trump be Trump\u2019 ethos.\u201d POLITICO\n\nCOURT WATCH -- \u201cJudge signals Dems may get to see Mueller\u2019s secrets,\u201d by Darren Samuelsohn: \u201cA federal judge signaled Tuesday that she might give House Democrats access to some of Robert Mueller\u2019s remaining secrets.\n\n\u201cDuring a two-hour hearing, Beryl Howell, chief judge for the U.S. District Court, challenged the Justice Department to explain its \u2018extraordinary position\u2019 of trying to block lawmakers from seeing the special counsel\u2019s grand jury materials, which include testimony and evidence that has been kept private since the Mueller probe ended in March. Grand jury material is protected by law, but judges can release information under special circumstances.\n\n\u201cIf Howell rules in Democrats\u2019 favor, it would represent a major legal victory for them and could help expand Congress\u2019 impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump. While the probe started earlier this year with a broader focus on Mueller\u2019s findings, the Democrats in recent weeks have homed in on the president\u2019s alleged attempt to pressure Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\u201d POLITICO\n\nA message from The Coalition Against Socialized Medicine: Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Price Controls on prescription drugs are Bad for Patients, Bad for Innovation, and Bad for America.

But there\u2019s little evidence that Biden has been significantly bloodied, according to a raft of new polls.\n\n\u201c In more than a dozen state and national Democratic primary polls since Trump launched his near-daily fusillade of attacks accusing Biden and his son, Hunter, of corrupt business dealings in Ukraine, Biden\u2019s standing has remained largely static.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cSanders Says He Will \u2018Change the Nature\u2019 of His Campaign After Heart Attack,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Sydney Ember and Jonathan Martin in Burlington, Vt.: \u201cSenator Bernie Sanders, in a striking concession for a leading presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that he planned to slow down his pace on the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack a week ago, and acknowledged that voters would likely consider his health when deciding whether to support him.\n\n\u201c\u2018I think we\u2019re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u2019 Mr. Sanders told reporters after a visit with a local cardiologist. \u2018Make sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\u2019\n\n\u201cMr. Sanders\u2019s remarks stood in sharp contrast with comments in recent days from his campaign advisers, who have insisted that the Vermont senator was neither changing course nor easing his trademark intensity as a result of the heart attack.\n\n\u201cGiven Mr. Sanders\u2019s influential role in the Democratic race, not only as a top candidate but also as a driving force in policy debates, his decision to pull back campaigning injects new uncertainty into the contest \u2014 both for the future of Mr. Sanders\u2019s candidacy and the possible ramifications for other contenders.\u201d NYT\n\nTHE JUICE \u2026\n\n-- FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: PLANNED PARENTHOOD is ramping up its political activity ahead of the 2020 election.

Listen to the podcast \u2026 Story by Zack Stanton\n\n-- ON THE CLINTON IMPEACHMENT: \u201cBecause the Clinton White House was so deliberate about keeping the impeachment effort, counter-impeachment effort, in a very tight and isolated circle, and preserving our ability to continue to govern on everything else, it didn\u2019t get into our national security bloodstream the way it is today. \u2026 And it is today, because one, it\u2019s a national security issue that\u2019s led to the inquiry, but also because the president seems to be taking this all on himself, and all of the public communication from him these days is about impeachment or some threat related to impeachment.\u201d\n\n-- ON U.S. STANDING IN THE WORLD IN THE TRUMP ERA: \u201cWe are denigrating our allies; we\u2019re starting trade wars and other conflicts with our allies; we\u2019re embracing our opponents like Putin, like Kim Jong Un, and heralding them as great leaders and friends when they are anything but,\u201d said Rice. \u201cRight now, up is down and down is up. ...\n\n\u201cCountries around the world have long started to question our interests, our purpose, and I think in particular they question the president\u2019s interests.

In almost every case of an international business enterprise stoking the authoritarian regime\u2019s ire, the company bowed to Chinese pressure, quickly apologizing in fear of losing access to a powerful economy of 1.4 billion people.\n\n\u201cBut the NBA may be more strongly positioned to push back than other U.S. businesses that have run afoul of the Chinese government. It\u2019s the most powerful sports league in the country and plays such an outsize role in local sporting culture that China without the NBA is increasingly unimaginable. Shortly before he became president, in fact, Xi Jinping went to a Lakers game in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIt was a useful reminder of how much both sides of this dispute rely on each other: China is a huge market for any enterprise, but there\u2019s only one NBA. There are other hotels, airlines and clothing brands.

Whether it be the wholesale elimination and prohibition of private insurance and imposition of socialized medicine in the form of Sen. Sanders\u2019 $32 trillion Medicare for All plan, or Speaker Pelosi\u2019s glidepath toward the same goal with her prescription drug pricing plan, these misguided proposals pose grave threats to the quality and availability of every single Americans\u2019 health care, to the cutting-edge treatments and cures of tomorrow, and to our nation\u2019s economy. Single payer health care schemes and drug price controls have been tried abroad with the same results: access restrictions for patients, decisions made by bureaucrats rather than patients and doctors, stifled innovation, and crippling taxes. This is not the policy prescription for health care in America.
