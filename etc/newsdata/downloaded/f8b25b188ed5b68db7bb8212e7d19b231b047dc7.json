There was no way our anxiety-prone Hot Dad would ever willingly place himself in a situation \u2014 especially one as important as trying to win over his fellow city councilmembers \u2014 in which he\u2019s not in control. Randall\u2019s a planner, people. So when Randall tells the councilmen he\u2019s ditched on multiple occasions that he has an in at an exclusive golf course and then goes on about how bad he is at golf before accepting the invitation to be their fourth (they want to make some money off of him), you know something\u2019s up.\n\nRandall is an excellent actor. He\u2019s shanking balls (I don\u2019t play golf, insert shrug emoji here), he doesn\u2019t even yell \u201cfore!\u201d when he almost hits some innocent bystanders. He takes the heat from his competitors, remaining charming and hapless, until one of the councilmen takes pity on him and begins giving him some tips. Take it slow, change your grip, follow through. And magically, Randall\u2019s not so bad anymore. Who knows how Randall knew the councilman would want to help him out on the golf course, but he played all of those guys perfectly and in the end, they\u2019re talking about helping each other out on votes and becoming the best of friends. Of course, by the end of \u201cThe Club,\u201d This Is Us makes the big reveal \u2014 the show cannot help itself \u2014 that Randall is actually great at golf by having him stay behind and crush some balls at the driving range. Randall is a tricky bitch and I am very much here for it.\n\nThe reveal is directly connected to a visit back to 1992 in which Jack sees just how close Randall\u2019s getting to his English teacher Mr. Lawrence and gets his back up about it. We\u2019ve seen Jack feel threatened by Randall\u2019s desire to have black male role models before (remember crying over pushups at a dojo?), but Randall\u2019s never been old enough to really understand what\u2019s going on, and certainly not old enough to call Jack out. But he\u2019s old enough now.\n\nJack sees how close Randall and Mr. Lawrence are getting when he drops Randall off at school early and watches the two chat about James Baldwin\u2019s Notes of a Native Son. Okay, can we first talk about how Randall makes his parents take him to school at 6 a.m.? Of all the ridiculous things Randall does on this show \u2014 at any age \u2014 this one cuts me deepest. No wonder Little Kevin makes fun of him so much.\n\nAnyway, Jack has nothing to contribute to Book Club, but when he sees Randall taking an interest in a young up-and-coming golfer named Tiger Woods, Jack pounces. He\u2019ll take Randall golfing. He wants to bond with his son! But Jack ends up being so Jack on this outing that things take a turn. Randall tells his dad about everything Mr. Lawrence has said about Tiger Woods breaking barriers and how Randall is breaking barriers by being the first black student on the debate team at school, and he even opens up about how he knows things won\u2019t be so easy for him in life. Jack misses the point completely, and eventually when he tells his young son that he \u201cjust doesn\u2019t see color,\u201d Randall has to explain to his father that this means he doesn\u2019t actually see him.\n\nThat one hits Jack hard. He tells his son that he\u2019s sorry and would like to be a better listener and less of a lecturer \u2026 and then follows that up with another Jack Lecture, so, like, did he learn anything today out on the golf course? This lecture, though, is about how Randall is going to be important and important relationships happen on the golf course. I mean, I don\u2019t see Jack taking his daughter out on the golf course to learn how to play, but I guess that\u2019s a conversation for another time. But it\u2019s here, from Jack, where Randall learned that he might have to \u201cplay down\u201d to the competition in order to really \u201cwin,\u201d if you know what I mean. And we see Jack making Randall practice over and over and over until Randall becomes an excellent golfer. Excellent enough to scam all of the Philadelphia city council. Jack\u2019s dreams for his son really do come true!\n\nIn the end, Jack does at least a little introspection and ends up inviting Mr. Lawrence and his wife over for dinner. Fingers crossed we see this dinner because it will be so awkward and I\u2019ve decided that an awkward meal is what This Is Us does best.\n\nWe learn about Jack\u2019s relationship to golf, too, because yes, what everyone wants in their primetime melodrama is more golfing storylines! Jack\u2019s aversion to golf comes from the time he was forced to go play a round with Rebecca\u2019s father and his friends. We head back to Jack and Rebecca\u2019s courtship, not long after their big dinner in which Dave Malone flat out tells Jack that there\u2019s no way in hell he\u2019ll be marrying his daughter. But good ol\u2019 Jack can never say no to Rebecca, and so when she encourages him to take her father up on his offer to go to the country club, he begrudgingly agrees.\n\nIt\u2019s a disaster, obviously. Dave is condescending and spends most of the time trying to get Jack a job interview with one of his buddies, something that Jack refuses to do out of principle. Meanwhile, Jack\u2019s coping with this awkward situation by swallowing full gin-and-tonics. That snack cart girl has never made so many drinks in one day! Just kidding, you know all those country clubbers are fully buzzed 90 percent of the time.\n\nJack continues to drink and also to refuse help from Dave\u2019s friends. As they\u2019re leaving, Dave gives Jack a big dressing down about how his daughter will be married in a big church wedding and the reception will be at this country club and like, who knew Dave was so into wedding planning? It\u2019s a big signal to Jack that once again, Dave doesn\u2019t see this relationship with Rebecca working out. He\u2019ll never be good enough. Jack, super drunk on G-and-Ts (which Dave knows), dishes it back once they arrive at the Malone\u2019s. He tells Dave he\u2019ll definitely be marrying his daughter, and they\u2019re going to have a happy home with lots of kids running around \u2014 does Dave see himself in that future? It\u2019s a great mic drop moment \u2026 until a drunk Jack gets in Dave\u2019s face and then trips on the lawn.\n\nIt\u2019s not a great look for Jack, but we know who wins this battle in the end.\n\nThis Is the Rest:\n\n\u2022 KaToby\u2019s trying to keep the fire going in their relationship, which has been nonexistent since Baby Jack was born. After some hurdles that include Kate worrying that Toby 2.0 is not attracted to her anymore and Toby feeling hurt that Kate might not totally support his weight loss, that fire burns brightly. It in no way fixes the problems in their relationship and I fear this isn\u2019t the end of their marital strife, but hey, it\u2019s nice that they\u2019re getting some.\n\n\u2022 Toby\u2019s latest nickname for Miguel is \u201cMiggy Stardust\u201d and it is perfect.\n\n\u2022 Speaking of! Kevin\u2019s getting bored in Bradford (he\u2019s staying until Nicky\u2019s court hearing). When a hike with Nicky doesn\u2019t work out, he heads to the gym, where he quickly lands a date with an employee. But in the end, it\u2019s Cassidy who provides some much needed distraction: When Kevin brings his date home, he finds Cassidy waiting there, upset after a fight with Ryan, and it\u2019s those two \u2014 you know, the ones with the simmering sexual tension \u2014 who end up in bed together.\n\n\u2022 The Kevin/Nicky buddy comedy continues: When Kevin informs his uncle that he was \u201cjust creeping on his ex\u201d after a little Instagram stalking, Nicky\u2019s pitch-perfect response is \u201cWhat\u2019s that even mean?\u201d\n\n\u2022 I so badly wanted the camera to zoom out in that final scene to show someone watching Randall as he turned around and hit a golf ball directly into a water hazard and said \u201cThat\u2019s for you, pop\u201d and be like \u201cWTF is going on here?\u201d Because that was\u2026 a lot.", "description": "Ah yes, what this show needed was definitely more golf storylines.
