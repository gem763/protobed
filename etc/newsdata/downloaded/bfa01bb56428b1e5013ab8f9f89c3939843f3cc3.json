REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/Files\n\nOther factors helping support risk sentiment, were reduced chances of Britain crashing out of the European Union on Oct. 31 without a deal, and a potential breakthrough in the Hong Kong political crisis following a move to withdraw an extradition bill that had sparked mass protests.\n\nSterling held onto gains made overnight, after the British parliament voted to stop a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit and to prevent Prime Minister Boris Johnson from calling a snap election that could have given him the mandate to keep alive the threat of \u201cno deal\u201d.\n\nIt still leaves Brexit up in the air, with possible outcomes still ranging from a no-deal exit to abandoning the whole endeavour.\n\nThe pound sat around $1.2241 and the euro at $1.1027, mostly holding on to overnight gains.\n\nFor the broader market, the resumption of China-U.S. trade talks was the main factor at play. Talks will be held in Washington in early October, China\u2019s commerce ministry said.\n\n\u201cThis news has injected a fair amount of optimism in markets,\u201d said Prashant Newnaha, senior rates strategist at TD Securities in Singapore.\n\n\u201cIt does seem that the markets were positioning more bearishly, and now we\u2019ve gotten this potential good news and the markets are running with it,\u201d he said, adding global economic indicators had also recently been showing some green shoots.\n\nSentiment has been skittish, however, and some analysts sounded a note of caution.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is still going to raise tariffs next month and December, as far as we know,\u201d said Joe Capurso, senior currency strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a negative for the world economy and the Chinese economy.\u201d\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar lifted a little from a one-week low to 98.482.\n\nThe Australian and New Zealand dollars, Chinese yuan and South Korean won all jumped against the dollar, while the yen fell nearly 0.4% to 106.75 per dollar, its weakest in more than three weeks.\n\nThe Australian dollar touched a one-month high of $0.6825, seen as a technical resistance level while the New Zealand dollar hit a one-week peak of $0.6377. The trade-exposed won climbed the most of Asia\u2019s currencies, rising about 0.5% to 1198.00 per dollar.\n\nThe Canadian dollar spiked sharply to C$1.3344 per dollar after the Bank of Canada left interest rates on hold and sounded less dovish than the market had expected.", "description": "China's yuan and the Australian dollar rallied after news on Thursday that China-U.S. trade talks would resume next month, but investors sold the safe haven yen, even though any de-escalation in the trade war would benefit Japanese exporters.", "authors": ["Tom Westbrook", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426433973&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840FY", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
