Those meetings and a gathering Friday of finance ministers and central bankers of the world\u2019s 20 biggest economies are expected to be dominated by efforts to de-escalate trade wars.\n\nThe new forecast predicts global growth of 3% this year, down 0.2 percentage point from its previous forecast in July and sharply below the 3.6% growth of 2018. For the United States this year, the IMF projects a modest 2.4% gain, down from 2.9% in 2018.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

But with no formal agreement reached and many issues yet to resolved, further talks will be needed to achieve any meaningful breakthrough. The Trump administration\u2019s threat to raise tariffs on an additional $160 billion in Chinese imports on Dec. 15 remains in effect.\n\nThe IMF\u2019s forecast predicted that about half the increase in growth expected next year will result from recoveries in countries where economies slowed significantly this year, as in Mexico, India, Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThis year\u2019s slowdown, the IMF said, was caused largely by trade disputes, which resulted in higher tariffs being imposed on many goods. Growth in trade in the first half of this year slowed to 1%, the weakest annual pace since 2012.\n\nKristalina Georgieva, who will preside over her first IMF meetings after succeeding Christine Lagarde this month as the fund\u2019s managing director, said last week that the various trade disputes could produce a loss of around $700 billion in output by the end of next year or about 0.8% of world output.\n\nIMF economists said one worrisome development is that the slowdown this year has occurred even as the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been cutting interest rates and deploying other means to bolster economies.\n\nThe IMF estimated that global growth would have been about one-half percentage point lower this year and in 2020 without the central banks\u2019 efforts to ease borrowing rates.\n\n\u201cWith central banks having to spend limited ammunition to offset policy mistakes, they may have little left when the economy is in a tougher spot,\u201d Gopinath said.\n\nIn addition to trade and geopolitical risks, the IMF envisions threats arising from a potentially disruptive exit by Britain from the European Union on Oct. 31. The IMF urged policymakers to intensify their efforts to avoid economically damaging mistakes.\n\n\u201cAs policy priorities go, undoing the trade barriers put in place with durable agreements and reining in geopolitical tensions top the list,\u201d Gopinath said. \u201cSuch actions can significantly boost confidence, rejuvenate investment, halt the slide in trade and manufacturing and raise world growth.\u201d\n\nThe IMF projected that growth in the 19-nation euro area will slow to 1.2% this year, after a 1.9% gain in 2018. It expects the pace to recover only slightly to 1.4% next year.\n\nGrowth in Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, is expected to be a modest 0.5% this year before rising to 1.2% next year.\n\nChina\u2019s growth is projected to dip to 6.1% this year and 5.8% next year. These would be the slowest rates since 1990, when China was hit by sanctions after the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square.\n\nFor Japan, the IMF expects growth of just 0.5% next year. It foresees an expansion in Russia of 1.9%, up from 1.1% this year.\n\nAnd Mexico is forecast to experience growth of 1.3% next year, far better than the lackluster 0.4% gain envisioned for this year.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The IMF is decreasing its outlook for the world economy, predicting that growth this year will be weak because of widening global conflicts.", "authors": ["Martin Crutsinger"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gita-gopinath.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
