VanZant appeared on Ariel Helwani\u2019s MMA Show on Monday to discuss her career\u2019s trajectory.\n\nIn a clip from the interview, which was shared on Twitter and quickly went viral, VanZant explained that she is seeking a pay raise although she\u2019s already been told that she wouldn\u2019t earn pay that\u2019s on par with a UFC champion.\n\n\u201cI make way more money sitting at home, posting pictures on Instagram than I do fighting,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I did my contract negotiation the last time, the talk was, 'I can\u2019t pay you more than a female champion.\u2019 Okay, but why are you comparing me to just women? All of us should be getting paid more in general.\u201d\n\nShe added that if she didn\u2019t make a living outside of the sport and lived off UFC fights and endorsements alone, she would be at a loss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want a significant pay raise, to be completely honest. I\u2019ve just been extremely accomplished outside of the UFC, as well as inside of the UFC,\u201d she told Helwani. \u201cFive wins in the UFC, four finishes, I've been main event twice, and I think someone with those accolades should be paid more.\u201d\n\nHowever, with injuries holding her back from her fighting career, it\u2019s not hard to see why VanZant has leveraged her 2.3 million Instagram followers and TV appearances as a source of income, some of which include her appearances on Dancing with the Stars,\u201d \u201cChopped\u201d and varied entertainment platforms as a sports commentator.\n\nVanZant was also a model in the 2019 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and has landed a feature in Adidas\u2019 \u201cShe Breaks Barriers\u201d campaign.\n\nDespite being a recognizable and beloved star, she has only entered the octagon eight times since joining the American mixed martial arts promotion company in 2014 as a flyweight.\n\nVanZant\u2019s last fight was on Jan. 19 at UFC Fight Night: Cejudo vs. Dillashaw, which took place at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y. There, she defeated Rachel Ostovich in round two with an armbar submission.\n\nPrevious to that, VanZant lost two consecutive fights; one to Jessica Rose-Clark on Jan. 14, 2018 and the other to Michelle Waterson on Dec. 17, 2016.\n\nHowever, this gap in her resume is a result of a slew of serious arm injuries that sidelined her from fighting for an entire year. A month after her fight with Ostovich, VanZant reinjured her arm with another fracture. By June, she revealed that the fracture hadn\u2019t healed properly and would need more surgery to properly recover.\n\nCurrently, VanZant has one fight left on her UFC contract.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "UFC starlet Paige VanZant doesn't make enough in The Octagon to sustain her lifestyle.
