When the reward for self-critical engagement with regulators is prosecution, people tend to clam up. Response turns to defence, which becomes legalistic rather than substantive.\n\nIn the combined 75 years that the three of us have been representing clients in this area, we have seen ASIC staffers become much more knowledgeable about the way corporates and industry players operate. This has been a direct result of industry engagement. A lack of openness and an adversarial atmosphere will reverse that trajectory. As for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, it was doing a lot right before the regulatory pendulum swung hard off the back of the royal commission. We shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that Australian banks weathered the financial crisis spectacularly well and APRA\u2019s light-but-effective touch played a big part in that.\n\nImpact on individuals\n\nFifth, litigation has a disproportionate impact on individuals caught up in it. It can and does ruin (often innocent) careers. In so many cases that we see, earnest and hard-working people get burnt. You only need to think about this point for a few seconds to realise that the most public instances in recent years form no \u201crogues\u2019 gallery\u201d.\n\nSixth, there is too much lag and often a lot of uncertainty while cases are dealt with. A case that takes some years to go through the court system with an uncertain outcome is not the best regulatory tool. Clear wrongdoing cannot go unpunished and litigation will often be appropriate \u2013 but it must not be the default or \u201cfront-line\u201d response to an alleged contravention.\n\nSeventh, the recommendation has come from litigators. As the old saying goes, never ask a surgeon whether to operate.\n\nThe \u201cshoot first\u201d concept was transplanted into the royal commission from the experience \u2013 strategically showcased \u2013 of the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission. You cannot compare the role of the two bodies. The ACCC is a genuine policeman in a narrow field, whereas ASIC has a broad licensing and conduct remit.\n\nLast, the regulators don\u2019t want it. They have been dragged to it. We accept that regulators have to be tough. They get accused of being toothless often, but that is because it is a cheap soundbite and an easy accusation to make. We can tell you, from representing clients for our whole careers, that ASIC has never been toothless. The minute an ASIC communication or formal notice arrives, clients stand to attention. And we also accept that the royal commission aired instances when parties were not transparent with regulators. That is unacceptable.\n\nBut litigation should always be a last resort. Not a default position.\n\nThe authors are partners at King & Wood Mallesons.", "description": "Eight good reasons why the Hayne royal commission's recommendation for ASIC to litigate as a starting point for non-compliance is not the right idea.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.209%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_1/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1bf988d7ef4739267dcf0521a225e07ec1873c0e", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
