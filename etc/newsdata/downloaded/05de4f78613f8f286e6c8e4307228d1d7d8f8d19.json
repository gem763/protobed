Again, if the \u201cthing\u201d was a property, it would need to be \u201cbusiness real property\u201d for this to be allowed.\n\nThe second situation is if \u2013 once the fund owns it \u2013 the trustee wishes to rent it to a related party. Again, SMSF trustees are quite entitled to own any kind of property and rent it out to someone else (in fact, there\u2019s not much point owning it if they don\u2019t). But if the person, company or trust that they are renting it to is a related party, they can only do that if it\u2019s business real property.\n\nTo re-cap, it\u2019s fine for an SMSF to own pretty much any property. Whether or not it\u2019s business real property only matters if the trustees want to buy it (or receive it without money changing hands) from a related party or rent it to a related party.\n\nIf they plan to buy it from strangers and rent it to strangers, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s a house, a shop or a bit of both. If they plan to buy it from a family member and then rent it to strangers, they only care whether it\u2019s business real property at the time it\u2019s being bought \u2013 once it\u2019s in the fund it doesn\u2019t matter any more.\n\nSo on those occasions when it really does matter whether the property is business or residential, what are the important things to look out for?\n\nIf there is anything at all going on at the property other than a business, don\u2019t assume it meets the definition of business real property.\n\nBusiness real property in a superannuation sense means that the property is actively being used in a business or normally would be (even it's between tenants). So, for example, just being zoned for commercial purposes isn\u2019t enough. And generally vacant land doesn\u2019t make the grade either because it\u2019s not actually being used for anything. Of course there are exceptions \u2013 if the property in question is a farm, it\u2019s fine to have some empty paddocks. But a property that is simply an empty block in an industrial estate that\u2019s not being used for anything would be a problem.\n\nIt must also be \u201cwholly and exclusively\u201d used in the business \u2013 a shop that has a residence upstairs normally fails here. There are exceptions where there\u2019s only a small part of the property that\u2019s not used by the business or where it\u2019s a farm that has a family home on it. But in short, if there is anything at all going on at the property other than a business, don\u2019t assume it meets the definition of business real property.\n\nOverall, business real property is a key piece of superannuation language and has a very specific meaning. When it\u2019s important, it\u2019s really important. But sometimes it doesn\u2019t matter whether a property is business real property or not. It always pays to check.\n\nMeg Heffron is MD at SMSF specialist firm Heffron.", "description": "It's got to be classified as 'business real property'.
