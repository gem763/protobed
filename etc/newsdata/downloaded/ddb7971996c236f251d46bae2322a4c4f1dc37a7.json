However, Johnson's indicates looser ties and a simple free trade agreement.\n\nRead more: What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal with the EU and what does it all mean?\n\nPro-EU campaigners piled more pressure on Javid to publish a new impact assessment.\n\n\"The chancellor's refusal to publish information about the impact of Boris Johnson's deal will send alarm bells ringing around the country,\" Naomi Smith, CEO of Best For Britain, told Business Insider.\n\n\"If the deal could stand up to scrutiny, there would no reason to hide the detail.\n\n\"Instead, what little we know about the deal shows it's even more of a national humiliation than Theresa May's botched effort.\n\n\"That's why this deal must be put to the people for the final say. They've played no part in negotiating this wretched deal, and it would be plain wrong to force it upon the country without their consent.\"", "description": "UK Chancellor Sajid Javid told reporters that Johnson's government sees \"no need for a new impact assessment\u201d.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9490/2f444f9bbdbf4fbca127caf653fc7eef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
