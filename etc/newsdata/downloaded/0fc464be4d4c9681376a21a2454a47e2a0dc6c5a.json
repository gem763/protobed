And this time, YouTube changed its strategy again, and the show \u2014 along with all YouTube's other premium original programming starting in September \u2014 has come out from behind the paywall.\n\nThe science-fiction drama, based on the Steven Gould novel, stars Maddie Hasson as a rebellious 17-year-old girl named Henry with the ability to teleport and Missi Pyle, who plays Henry's mother, Cleo Coles.\n\nViewers can watch weekly episodes of \"Impulse\" for free (with ads), or pay to unlock all 10 episodes with a YouTube premium membership ($11.99 a month).\n\n\"I've always wanted the show to be free,\" Liman said, adding that the budget remained the same for season two.\n\n'Impulse' took inspiration from YouTube and its authenticity\n\nLiman said he took inspiration from YouTube as a platform when crafting \"Impulse.\"\n\nYouTube has a certain level of honesty and viewers come to \"watch content that's real,\" Liman said. \"When I'm doing action sequences, I'm looking to things on YouTube that are exhilarating and real.\"\n\nPyle agreed, and said the cast was constantly changing up the lines and improving scenes as they went along.\n\n\"You can create something that's authentic when you're finding it as you go, not just painting by the numbers,\" Pyle said. \"On some shows and movies that's really just not allowed.\"\n\nCreating a show for a certain TV network means thinking about that network's brand, Liman said.\n\nBut the audiences on YouTube are vast, and vary between channels, videos, and programs. Each piece of content on the platform is wildly different, even down to YouTube's original programming, which ranges from popular internet star Liza Koshy's hit show \"Liza on Demand,\" a comedy where Liza is tasked with odd jobs and gigs, to YouTube creator Joey Graceffa's fantasy horror, \"Escape the Night.\"\n\n\"We are in the forefront for them, and they are making the rules up as we go,\" Liman said.\n\nKnown to sit in the back of movie screenings and watch people watch his films, Liman said he values the real-time comments left below episodes of \"Impulse.\"\n\n\"TV doesn't normally give you that experience,\" he said. \"I could go on right now, and there's gonna be someone watching an episode, posting comments. I'm very interested in my relationship with my audience, and I do it for them.\"", "description": "YouTube Originals show \"Impulse\" returned with a 10-episode second season, with weekly episodes available free online.", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da868ebcc4a0a3027359b57?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
