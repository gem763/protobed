Another requires annual reviews by the U.S. secretary of state of Hong Kong\u2019s special economic and trade status, providing a check on Beijing\u2019s influence over the territory. A third bill would ensure that U.S. weapons are not being used against protesters by police.\n\nAll three bills were approved on separate voice votes.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

China has benefited from this special status and used it to evade U.S. export controls and sanctions, Pelosi and other lawmakers said.\n\n\u201cSolemn promises made by Beijing are rarely kept and far too many leaders of the free world are far too eager to blindly accept fiction over fact,\u201d said Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., a lead sponsor of one of the Hong Kong bills.\n\nUnder President Xi Jinping, human rights abuses in China have significantly worsened, including the pervasive use of torture, religious persecution and human trafficking, Smith said.\n\nChina \u201cexcels in crushing bodies, shattering bones, torturing dissidents and filling concentration camps \u2014 massive crimes against humanity for which there has been little or no accountability or sanction,\u201d Smith said. \u201cToday we\u2019re simply urging the Chinese president and the Hong Kong Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, to faithfully honor the government\u2019s promises.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s bill would require a report by the Commerce Department on whether the Hong Kong government adequately enforces U.S. export controls and sanctions laws. It also allows qualified Hong Kong residents to work or study in the U.S. even if they have been arrested for participating in nonviolent protests.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said last week that he would \u201clike to see a very humane solution\u201d to the Hong Kong protests. \u201cI hope that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said Oct. 7 at the White House. \u201cAnd, you know, Hong Kong is very important as a world hub \u2014 not just for China, but for the world.\u201d\n\nMany protesters fly American flags, and Trump said he is hopeful a humane deal can be worked out, adding: \u201cI think President Xi has the ability to do it.\u201d\n\nPelosi was less optimistic. Since China used its military to crush the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in Beijing, \u201cwe have seen that commercial interest always win,\u201d she said during House debate. \u201cIt\u2019s always about the money.\u201d\n\nCiting the Bible, Pelosi said, \u201cWhat does it profit a person if he gains the whole world but loses his soul?\u201d\n\nRep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., who sponsored one of the Hong Kong bills, said that \u201cthe world is watching Hong Kong, and Hong Kong is watching the floor of the House of Representatives\u201d to see if lawmakers support the protesters instead of the Chinese government.\n\nUnder pressure from China, tech giant Apple removed a smartphone app that enabled Hong Kong protesters to track police, while the National Basketball Association has seen its once-thriving relationship with China become strained after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for the Hong Kong protesters.\n\n\u201cCorporations bow down to China for profit,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cIt\u2019s time we stand up to China.\u201d\n\nThe three bills now head to the Senate. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday he had no scheduling announcement.\n\nMcConnell chided the NBA, saying in a tweet last week that \u201cthe people of Hong Kong have risked much more than money to defend their freedom of expression, human rights and autonomy. I hope the @NBA can learn from that courage and not abandon those values for the sake of their bottom line.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee last month advanced an amendment that McConnell said would ensure \u201cthe U.S. maintains a watchful eye on the Chinese government\u2019s aggressive encroachment on Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The House passed three bills Tuesday aimed at showing U.S. support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Matthew Daly"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ap19288510726698.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
