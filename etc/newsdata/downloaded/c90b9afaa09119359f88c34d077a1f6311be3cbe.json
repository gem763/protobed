The site does not allow the documents to be downloaded.\n\nThe Information Ministry did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nOpposition leader Juan Guaido in January invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency after declaring Maduro's 2018 re-election a fraud.\n\nThe two sides in May opened dialogue mediated by Norway, but talks stalled after the Trump administration announced a new round of sanctions.\n\nOne opposition official said the government may be using the Boston Group talks to divide the opposition.\n\n\"The government uses this to sustain the idea that there isn't a single opposition but rather several oppositions,\" said the official. \"Then it decides which one it wants to talk to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Writing by Brian Ellsworth; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne)", "description": "A group of Venezuelan government officials and opposition activists are quietly holding talks focused on the economy despite the stalling of a formal dialogue mediated by Norway, according to nine sources involved.
