The top decile of companies within the S&P 500 that improved their ESG scores over a five-year period, as ranked by Sustainalytics, put up over 4,500 basis points of outperformance relative to the index overall. A basis point is 1/100th of 1%.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up roughly 19% in the year to date, up 58% over the past five years.\n\nSome notable names on the outformance list include Facebook FB, -2.38% , Mastercard MA, -2.13% , Visa V, -1.25% , Salesforce CRM, -1.42% , and Microsoft MSFT, -1.63% .\n\nOpinion: For ESG investors, the newest challenge is separating fact from \u2018greenwashing\u2019\n\nTech-sector companies drove much of this ESG-over-S&P 500 outperformance, but even within that group, companies that improved their ESG scores outperformed industry peers by 3,700 basis points.\n\nOther data show the growing importance of ESG factors, even the perception of such factors, in investing decision-making, including in the fund industry. In 2018, US SIF, also known as the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, identified $12 trillion in U.S.-domiciled assets whose managers either review ESG issues as part of their investment analysis or portfolio selection or file shareholder resolutions on ESG issues at their portfolio companies\u2019 annual meetings. This total is an increase of 38% since 2016.\n\nLisa Woll, CEO of US SIF, has been outspoken on what she says can be unfair analysis of ESG-linked stock returns. She wrote about it in a counter argument for MarketWatch this summer, saying that critics, including noted retirement expert Alicia Munnell, also writing for MarketWatch, too easily dismiss a \u201cpreponderance of substantive evidence that sustainable investing does not produce worse results for investors.\u201d", "description": "Companies that improve their environmental, social and governance reputations outperform the S&P 500 \u2014 big tech and financial services firms among them.", "authors": ["Rachel Koning Beals", "News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT416_5_logo_ZG_20191016105109.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
