Deals are being done and early signs are that business could be brisk this autumn even as Westminster continues to argue over Brexit.\u2019\n\nHouse price inflation has slipped slightly but remained relatively stable this year, says Halifax\n\nA separate report today from property website Zoopla highlighted the increasing importance of first-time buyers in recent years, as their numbers finally revive after the post financial crisis years.\n\nIt said: \u2018In recent years, first time buyers have been the driving force behind housing sales. First-time buyer numbers have grown for eight consecutive years, up 85 per cent since 2010, outpacing other buyer groups\n\nIt said that new homeowners were the largest purchaser group in 2018, accounting for 36 per cent of sales and half of all mortgages for home purchase and it expected this to be the same this year.\n\nMike Scott, chief property analyst at estate agent Yopa, said: \u2018There is no sign of any sustained fall in house prices on the horizon. Mortgage approvals remain strong, and HMRC\u2019s gloomy provisional figures for the numbers of homes sold in May and June have now been revised upwards as more returns have been received for those months.\u2019", "description": "Halifax said that the average UK house price rose 1.8 per cent in the year to August to reach \u00a3233,541, but this is \u00a3654 cheaper than the peak of \u00a3234,195 reached in February.", "authors": ["Simon Lambert For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
