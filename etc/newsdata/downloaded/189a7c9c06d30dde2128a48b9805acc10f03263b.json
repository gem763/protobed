In many cases, business credit cards offer similar perks to their non-business counterparts, often with additional benefits or bonus categories thrown in to address business owners' particular needs.\n\nIf you have a company or a side gig that qualifies you for a business card and you could make use of some extra Marriott points, now's a good time to look at the Marriott Bonvoy Business Amex.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nRead more: The best business credit cards available now\n\nMarriott Bonvoy Business Amex offer details\n\nThe Marriott Bonvoy Business is currently offering 100,000 Marriott points to new cardholders who spend $5,000 in the first three months. The standard welcome offer is for 75,000 points, so you can get 25,000 more points right now.\n\nThis a limited-time offer, available though October 23, so don't wait too long if you're interested.\n\nAs part of this offer, the card's also available with 0% APR for the first six months. After that, the APR is a variable rate of 17.74% to 26.74%. There are better 0% options for carrying a balance, especially if you need to carry it for longer than six months, but if your business is short on cash flow in the first few months and you know you'll be able to pay it off before the six-month period ends, this offer is something to consider.\n\nHow much is this offer worth?\n\nTravel website The Points Guy values Marriott points at 0.8 cents apiece, which would mean the Bonvoy Business Amex card's 100,000-point offer is worth $800.\n\nThis valuation is based on the various options you have for using Marriott points. The most obvious way to redeem your points is to book free hotel nights, and with 100,000 points you have plenty of options.\n\nAs just one example, you could put 100,000 Marriott points to use at a Category 4 hotel that costs 25,000 points per night and get four free nights. I took a look at the Marriott properties in Italy and saw some nice options, including the Renaissance Tuscany II Ciocco Resort & Spa and the Eremito, Parrano, a Member of Design Hotels in Umbria.\n\nOf course, you could also splurge for a higher-end hotel like the Category 8 St. Regis Florence, where a free night costs 85,000 points.\n\nMarriott Bonvoy Business Amex benefits\n\nThe Bonvoy Business Amex earns bonus points on a handful of spending categories:\n\n6x points on eligible Marriott purchases\n\n4x points at US restaurants, US gas stations, on wireless telephone services purchased directly from US service providers, and on US purchases for shipping\n\n2x points on everything else\n\nIt's probably not the best option if you just want one business credit card for all your spending \u2014 you could do better with an option that earns a flat rate on all purchases, like the Ink Business Unlimited.\n\nThe card comes with several other benefits for Marriott guests:\n\nA free night award each year after your card account anniversary for hotels that cost up to 35,000 points per night\n\nComplimentary Marriott Silver status\n\n15 elite night credits toward status each year\n\nThere's a $125 annual fee, and no foreign transaction fees.", "description": "Now is a great time to apply for this Marriott Amex business credit card, since you'll earn 25,000 more points than the standard welcome offer.", "authors": ["Sarah Silbert"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7655732e22af725b6c1974-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
