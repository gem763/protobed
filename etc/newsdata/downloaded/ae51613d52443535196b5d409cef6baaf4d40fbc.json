Chants of \"lock him up\" could also be heard, an effort to appropriate the \"lock her up!\" mantra begun by Trump supporters in 2016 against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cLock him up,\u201d said Lahren, \"How original. It\u2019s sad these Trump haters can\u2019t even come up with their own jeers. Still, our president didn\u2019t seem fazed by the booing whatsoever.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s not surprising these heckling jerks didn\u2019t seem to bother our president,\" Lahren went on. \"Sure, a baseball stadium setting during the World Series is certainly a popular place -- but our president fills comparably-sized stadiums like that at almost every rally and he does it with just a podium and an American flag!\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s do some math, shall we?\" the Fox Nation host continued. \"Nationals Park seats about 41,000 people. If one-third of those people were jeering and booing the president, that\u2019s roughly 13,500 people. Compare that the approximately 20,000 Trump supporters who packed into a sold-out American Airlines Center in Dallas for his rally just a couple of weeks ago- all cheering for their president,\" she said.\n\n\"And that doesn\u2019t even include the overflow crowd waiting outside, also cheering for their president!\"\n\nLater in the episode, Lahren showed a clip from last year's Army-Navy football game, showing a loud cheering crowd as the president stood up.\n\n\"Soldiers and sailors giving our president a standing ovation, cheering, clapping and supporting their president. Yeah, .I\u2019d guess Trump places a little bit more weight on a reaction from a crowd like that than some baseball fans who disrespect not just Donald Trump, but the office of the presidency,\" Lahren said, \"especially on the day after our U.S. special forces killed the number one most wanted terrorist in the world under the leadership of their commander and chief, Donald J. Trump,\" a reference to the death of ISIS mastermind Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\n\"Oh, and side note,\" Lahren concluded, \"the Nationals lost that game 7-1. President Trump won the 2016 election and is well on his way to winning again in 2020 and their boos and jeers won\u2019t change that.\n\n\"Play ball!\"\n\nTo see Lahren's full remarks and for more episodes of Tomi Lahren's daily commentary offering a refreshing and unfiltered perspective on issues across the country, join Fox Nation and watch \"Final Thoughts\" today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
