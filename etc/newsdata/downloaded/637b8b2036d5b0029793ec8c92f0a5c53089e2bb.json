Tolerance for homosexuality has also risen, the Copenhagen Post reported.\n\nAt the same time, the number of \u2018new Danes\u2019 who believe women should only be allowed to marry a man approved by their family has risen.\n\nThe results give cause for concern, according to Immigration Minister Mattias Tesfaye, who told the BT tabloid that while he understood that Middle Eastern immigrants want to \u201chold onto the values they were raised with,\u201d it should be the case that \u201cmore and more accept the values of democracy from generation to generation.\u201d\n\nWhen half of the descendants [of immigrants] believe that religion should be exempt from criticism, I interpret that as people thinking that democracy must step out of the way.\n\nDemocracy in Europe means that people are given the freedom to practice their religion, but \u201cequally crucial,\u201d Tesfaye said, is that religion has to be able to \u201cwithstand criticism.\u201d\n\nFor instance, while the Koran says a woman may only marry another Muslim, one must accept that there will be people who want to challenge that and they must be allowed. \u201cThe Constitution states that we are all free people, and that rule is above everyone else\u2019s rules,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the subject of religious symbols in dress, 88 percent of immigrants\u2019 descendants said it was important that people should be allowed to wear religious symbols freely, while 68 first-generation immigrants felt the same. A smaller majority of 63 percent of ethnic Danes agreed.\n\nThe idea of religion being protected from criticism is not unusual in Europe, where, in many countries, anti-blasphemy laws are still in place.\n\nAlso on rt.com Denmark repeals blasphemy law, Koran burner walks free\n\nAn Austrian woman was convicted last year after she called the Prophet Mohammed a \u201cpaedophile\u201d in seminars she delivered in Vienna, during which she said the prophet had married a six-year-old girl and consummated the marriage when she was nine years old \u2014 a subject of some historical debate. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) upheld the conviction, saying it \u201cserved the legitimate aim of preserving religious peace.\u201d\n\nIn other parts of Europe, things are moving in a different direction, however.\n\nIreland deleted an outdated blasphemy law from its constitution in a 2018 referendum, which saw almost 65 percent voting yes to removing the ban \u2014 though it had been 150 years since anyone was actually prosecuted for blasphemy in Ireland. Denmark repealed its own blasphemy law in 2017.\n\nLike this story?
