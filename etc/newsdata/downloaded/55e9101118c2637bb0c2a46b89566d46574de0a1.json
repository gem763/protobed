But not so fast.\n\nAs the Chinese curse portends, \u201cmay you live in interesting times,\u201d and we definitely do. When new jobs are created and added to the labor pool, it is usually seen as evidence of a growing economy and as a vital necessity to driving down unemployment. However, what if there isn\u2019t any unemployment? What happens then?\n\nThe current unemployment rate of 3.7 percent is the lowest America has seen in 50 years, and it has remained pretty much unchanged over the past year or so. Economists define full employment as an economic state where unemployment hovers somewhere between 4 percent and 6 percent \u2014 some employable folks choose to watch daytime TV instead of getting a job even when one is available. The \u201cinteresting times\u201d we find ourselves in are a period where the labor force is actually overemployed.\n\nAsk any first-year economics student and they will tell you that the demand for labor is a derived demand. What that means is that the demand by businesses for employees is driven by the demand for the goods and services they sell. If business is good, they hire (demand) more employees. If business slows down, they let folks go. But we haven\u2019t seen times like these for half of a century, so maybe it doesn\u2019t work that way when we\u2019re beyond full employment.\n\nSure, new job creation is slowing \u2014 albeit, one month isn\u2019t a trend \u2014 but it is slowing. And the GDP growth rate is slowing, too. These are both signs that pundits point to as indicators the economy is headed down. But what if growth is slowing because firms can\u2019t hire enough workers? Yes, the derived demand for labor is there, but output can\u2019t increase because there\u2019s nobody to fill the jobs. What would be a sign that this may be the case? Wage gains, of course.\n\nWhen the supply of something is constricted, its price goes up. In the case of labor that price is the wage rate, and we\u2019re seeing stronger gains in that area the past 18 months than have been seen in a decade. The current 3.9 percent increase exceeds inflation and is close to pre-2008 recession levels.\n\nThe last time the unemployment rate moved beyond the full employment level a recession didn\u2019t immediately follow, but slowing job growth did, and also slowing GDP growth. That was in 1968 and 1969, and inflation started rising along with wage levels. The Federal Reserve tried to stem the rapidly rising price level with higher rates, but its efforts were ineffective.\n\nLooking at the economic picture in 1970 \u2014 essentially 2020 in our current world \u2014 the GDP only grew 0.2 percent, compared to 3.1 percent the previous year. Currently, the U.S. GDP is growing at about 2.1 percent down from a decade high of 3.1 percent in 2018. In 1970, the economic growth was slowing just like today, while low unemployment drove wage growth upward, along with inflation.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, the ultimate result of this inversion between unemployment and full was stagflation \u2014 a flat economy with high inflation and high interest rates, but not a recession. Nonetheless, political pundits laid the blame on the administration and things escalated from there. The outcome was capped with Congress holding impeachment hearings.
