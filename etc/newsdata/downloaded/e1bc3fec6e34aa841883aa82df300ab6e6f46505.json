Beating Donald Trump requires getting out the vote. And in order to get people to turn out and vote, a presidential candidate has to be inspiring. Which means big ideas, a vision of an America that could become a reality if we all got behind it, a sense of where we need to be heading.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled. This primary is not a contest between someone who\u2019s electable and someone who has big ideas. Big ideas are essential in order to be electable.\n\nSomething else I\u2019m hearing is that the contest is between someone who\u2019s a moderate and a candidate who\u2019s on the left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, that\u2019s rubbish. All the babble about moderate or left assumes we\u2019re back in the old politics where the central question was the size of government.\n\nBut today the real contest is between the people and the powerful \u2013 the vast majority of Americans versus an oligarchy that\u2019s amassed most of the nation\u2019s wealth and power.\n\nThat small group of hugely wealthy and powerful people got a giant $2 trillion tax cut from Trump and his Republican enablers, and they want to pay for it by trashing Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe oligarchy would rather we fight among ourselves for the scraps they\u2019ve left behind than see what\u2019s really happening. Divide and conquer: Middle class against poor, white against black, native-born American against immigrant, Christian against Muslim. That way we don\u2019t see that they\u2019ve been looting America.\n\nTrump\u2019s followers don\u2019t see he\u2019s really a tool of the oligarchy, doing their bidding, reorganizing America so they accumulate even more wealth and power. And as long as we fight among ourselves, we don\u2019t join together and reclaim our economy and our democracy.\n\nOne final thing I\u2019ve been hearing is that we should go back to the way it was before Trump. That\u2019s baloney.\n\nThe way it was before Trump brought us Trump. The way it was before Trump was an economy rigged for the benefit of the few, stagnant wages, socialism for the rich and harsh capitalism for everyone else, a health care system whose co-payments and deductibles were out of control and still didn\u2019t cover 30 million Americans, and big money controlling our politics.\n\nNo, we don\u2019t want to go back to the way it was before Trump. We have to go forward.\n\nSo don\u2019t accept false choices about who\u2019s electable versus who has ideas, who\u2019s moderate versus who\u2019s on the left, or whether we need to go back to the way it was before Trump.\n\nIn reality, what\u2019s going to beat Trump are new ideas that mobilize America, that let Americans see what the wealthy and powerful who bankroll Trump have done to this nation, and get us looking forward to what America should be rather than backward to an America that was never as good as it could be.", "description": "", "authors": ["Robert Reich", "Robert Reich'S Blog"], "top_image": "https://www.alternet.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/centrists.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
