Mark Phelan, Detroit Free Press Auto Critic\n\nThe menacing image of a king cobra poised to strike has been synonymous with Shelby Cobra Mustangs since 1965, but the badge for Ford\u2019s new 2020 Mustang Shelby GT500 \u2014 at 760 horsepower, the most powerful street-legal Ford ever \u2014 could equally easily be a winged pillow.\n\nIt\u2019s brutally quick \u2013 3.3 seconds to go from 0 to 60 mph and 10.7 seconds to go a standing quarter-mile \u2013 but not remotely punishing, simultaneously the fastest and most comfortable GT500 ever.\n\nThank a brand new dual-clutch seven-speed automatic transmission and Magneride adaptive shocks, plus the undivided attention of Ford Performance chief engineer Carl Widmann\u2019s team virtually since the day the last killer Shelby, the Mustang GT350, hit the road in 2015.\n\nThe GT350\u2019s handling raised the stakes for the GT500. The new car answers with a straight flush: handling, straight-line speed, dramatic looks, ride comfort and a dynamite dual-clutch automatic transmission.\n\nPrices for the 2020 Shelby GT500 start at $70,300. It should be in dealerships any day.\n\nHowling on the outside, quiet on the inside\n\nThe magic starts with the engine, a supercharged 5.2L V8 that can howl like a banshee but leaves the cabin quiet enough for conversation at normal levels. There\u2019s even a \u201cgood neighbor mode\u201d you can program so\u2019s not to wake somebody sleeping next door.\n\nFloor it and the engine races to its 7,500 rpm redline, pushing occupants back like a runaway, well, mustang.\n\nThe 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT 500 is the most powerful street-legal vehicle in Ford's history.

The Porsche 911\u2019s DCT was the benchmark as Ford developed the new gearbox. Sport mode delivers the quickest shifts, just 8 milliseconds \u2014 quicker than a human can press the clutch in, let alone change gears, according to Ford engineers.\n\nGM earnings: GM says UAW strike cost nearly $3 billion but still turns third-quarter profit\n\nAdaptive shock absorbers keep the car from squatting back on its rear wheels even with the accelerator floored. The ride is surprisingly smooth.\n\nFord specified 20-inch wheels to make room for massive 16.53-inch front brake discs that deliver 25% more heat dissipation than the GT350\u2019s brakes. Improved heat dissipation means the brakes continue to work longer under sudden extreme stops and deceleration from high speeds.\n\nThe 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT 500's supercharged 5.2L V8 generates 760 horsepower and 650 pound-feet of torque.

The carbon fiber aerodynamics package produces a maximum of 550 pounds of downforce to keep the GT500 from leaving the ground \u2014 at 180 mph.\n\nThe thick steering wheel wrapped in suede-like Alcantara sets you up for success when the white line is at 12 o\u2019clock to let you know when wheels are aimed dead ahead, an important consideration when you could be drag-racing at wide-open throttle from a standstill.\n\nThat same steering wheel connects to a rack that\u2019s unique to the GT500, with extra-large electric motors to turn the big, sticky tires. Response is quick, but not nervous, just what you want driving around the technical street course at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.\n\nEvery GT500 engine is signed by the person who built it.

You can dial in launch control and heat the tires with electronically controlled burnouts for maximum traction. I hit 111 mph in a quarter-mile run, despite accidentally short-shifting with the steering wheel-mounted paddle shifter.\n\nThe high-bolstered optional two-tone Recaro front sport seats look great, but I found the seat-bottom bolsters so high that I continually bumped my head getting in and out of the Shelby.\n\nThe rest of the interior is comfortable and easy to use, with a combination of dials, buttons, voice recognition and touch screen.\n\n2020 Mustang G500. (Photo: Ford Motor Company)\n\n$21,495 gets you lots of options\n\nThe Shelby GT500 I drove had $21,495 in options, mostly the $18,500 carbon fiber track pack that includes 20-inch exposed carbon fiber wheels, assorted other carbon fiber pieces and leather trimmed Recaro seats. Its total price of $91,795 also included a $2,600 gas guzzler tax.\n\nThe GT500 lineup is as colorful as a bag of Skittles: bright green and orange in addition to deep metallic blue, gray, black, red and silver.\n\nStandard features on the GT500\n\n1,000-watt B&O audio\n\nTouch screen\n\nNavigation\n\nApple CarPlay\n\nAndroid Auto\n\nOne-piece carbon fiber drive shaft\n\nLaunch control with line lock\n\nDriver-programmable settings for suspension, exhaust note, steering and powertrain\n\nDrive modes for normal, sport, track, drag and wet weather\n\nDual zone climate control\n\nPaddle shifters\n\nPush button start\n\nDriving 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT 500s in Nevada.
