Guyger was convicted of murdering Jean and sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nJacquerious Mitchell, 20, Michael Mitchell, 32, and Thaddeous Green, 22, allegedly traveled to Dallas from Alexandria, Louisiana, to purchase drugs from Brown when a physical altercation took place, leading to gunfire in the parking lot, Assistant Police Chief Avery Moore said at a press conference.\n\nDallas PD Thaddeous Green, 22, and Michael Mitchell, 32, remain wanted in Joshua Brown's shooting death, Dallas police said on Tuesday. A third suspect, Jacquerious Mitchell, is in custody.\n\nJacquerious Mitchell told police Brown shot him in his chest before Green shot Brown twice, killing him. The three of them then fled the scene. Jacquerious Mitchell was dropped off to seek medical help at a hospital, which is where he was taken into police custody, Moore said.\n\nA later search of Brown\u2019s apartment recovered 12 pounds of marijuana, 149 grams of THC cartridges and $4,000 cash. Green and Michael Mitchell remain at large as of Tuesday afternoon, Moore said.\n\nAuthorities went on to stress that rumors linking Brown\u2019s death and the Guyger trial are \u201cfalse\u201d and jeopardize the integrity of the city and its police force.\n\nThe rumors shared by community leaders that Mr. Brown\u2019s death was related to the Amber Guyger trial and that DPD was responsible are false. We encourage those leaders to be mindful because their words may jeapordize the integrity of the city of Dallas and DPD. @ChiefHallDPD \u2014 Dallas Police Dept (@DallasPD) October 8, 2019\n\nIn a statement released by attorney Lee Merritt, Brown\u2019s family responded Tuesday by urging the Dallas police department to turn the investigation over to an outside agency. Merritt represented Jean\u2019s family in the murder trial.\n\n\u201cThis family and their representatives have consciously avoided speculating about law enforcement involvement in this tragedy, however, due to the proximity of this murder with the trial of Amber Guyger \u2014 rumors abound,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cIt will be nearly impossible to conduct a reliable investigation in a climate where the investigating agency has been implicated in the murder itself,\u201d it continued. \u201cA cloud of suspicion will rest over this case until steps are taken to ensure the trustworthiness of the process.\u201d\n\nMerritt earlier in the day had said that Brown pleaded not to testify on the stand in the Guyger trial, fearing that it could put his life at risk. Brown had survived a shooting last November that left one man dead and one of two shooters at large, and was concerned he would be at risk.\n\n\u201cJosh was concerned that these people still meant him harm so when he was subpoenaed to testify against Amber Guyger he was conflicted,\u201d Merritt said in a Facebook post. \u201cUltimately he decided that it was just too dangerous.\u201d\n\nJeremy Lock / Reuters Botham Jean's family attorneys, Benjamin Crump, Lee Merrit and Daryl Washington, address the press after the conviction charge of murder was delivered on Oct. 1.\n\nMerritt said Brown left the state and was in California when prosecutors caught up with him and threatened to issue a warrant for his arrest if he didn\u2019t return and appear in court.\n\n\u201cSo he got on a plane and came straight from the airport to the courthouse,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cBrown\u2019s testimony was powerful but it was also duplicative. Nothing he testified to couldn\u2019t have been brought in by other witnesses. It wasn\u2019t worth his life.\u201d\n\nThe Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment on Brown\u2019s testimony.", "description": "Dallas police said they have issued three capital murder arrest warrants in Brown's shooting death.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9cd33f210000e70633db83.jpeg?cache=qn2zffngzc&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
