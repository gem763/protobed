The index was already under pressure from Micron\n\nTechnology Inc's , which tumbled after it forecast a\n\ndisappointing first-quarter profit. The S&P technology index dropped 1.3%. U.S.-listed\n\nshares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N , Baidu Inc\n\nand JD.com Inc all slid.\n\nAdding to the negative momentum in afternoon trade, the S&P\n\n500 index briefly fell below its 50-day moving average.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 70.87 points,\n\nor 0.26%, to 26,820.25, the S&P 500 lost 15.83 points, or\n\n0.53%, to 2,961.79 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped\n\n91.03 points, or 1.13%, to 7,939.63.\n\nAll three indexes ended lower for the week as well, with the\n\nS&P 500 and Nasdaq registering their biggest weekly percentage\n\ndrops since August. The Cboe volatility index ended at a\n\nthree-week high.\n\nShares of Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N rose 3.8% and the stock\n\nwas the top gainer in the S&P 500 after the lender named banking\n\nveteran Charles Scharf as chief executive officer. Data early in the day showed U.S. consumer spending barely\n\nrose in August, suggesting that the economy's main growth engine\n\nwas slowing after accelerating sharply in the second quarter. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a\n\n1.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.94-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the\n\nNasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 118 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 6.68 billion shares, compared\n\nto the 7.2 billion average for the full session over the last 20\n\ntrading days.\n\n\n\n", "description": "US STOCKS-Wall St drops; White House considers delisting Chinese companies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_2_800x533_L_1412601599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
