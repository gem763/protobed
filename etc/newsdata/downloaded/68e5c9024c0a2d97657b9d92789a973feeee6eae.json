It\u2019s the day after the Toronto International Film Festival premiere of Johnson\u2019s feature-film directorial debut, Tammy\u2019s Always Dying, in which Huffman plays an alcoholic and verbally abusive mother who threatens to jump off a bridge every month in order to keep her adult daughter tethered to their small town. Huffman gives a jarring and transformative performance that I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be promoting under different circumstances. (The actress is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to committing mail fraud in the now-infamous U.S. college admissions scandal.)\n\nJohnson doesn\u2019t reference Huffman\u2019s situation directly, but she does reveal the \u201cmortifying\u201d mistake she made in sending the actress an invite to the Tammy premiere. \u201cI did accidentally CC Felicity on a massive email to a bunch of friends, going \u2018Did everybody get your tickets?'\u201d Johnson laughs nervously. \u201cAnd then [Felicity] texted me, \u2018Hey pal, sounds really exciting. Congratulations!\u2019 I was like, \u2018Oh my God. Felicity, I\u2019m so sorry!'\u201d It was an honest mix-up (she meant to include her friend Felix) but Johnson is clearly still embarrassed \u2014 she tells the story in a polite and profusely apologetic way that feels very Canadian. It\u2019s fitting that the Massachusetts-born actor-turned-filmmaker is now an official citizen of the North.\n\nAfter starting her career as the pink Power Ranger on Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and landing a supporting role as Julie on the classic J.J. Abrams-helmed teen drama Felicity, Johnson spent much of the rest of her acting days in Canada, with a role on the hit show Flashpoint, which filmed in Toronto. A decade later, she\u2019s settled down in the city with her daughter and moved behind the camera. Here, she tells Refinery29 why her feature-length directorial debut means so much to her, what she loved about working with Huffman, and revisits her days in pink spandex and playing the other Felicity\u2019s roommate.\n\nCongrats on Tammy\u2019s Always Dying. Tell me about your personal connection to the film.\n\nI connected to it on a cathartic core-deep level because my father struggles with depression and alcoholism and my mother passed away from cancer. It was the first time I directed something that I didn\u2019t write, but the fact that I could climb my way inside the story because of so many personal connections was helpful. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have tried to make it.\n\nSo, you could see your father in Tammy.\n\nOh god, yeah. My dad is a non-functioning alcoholic. Now, it\u2019s just sad and depressing how far gone he is, but he was a very funny person and so eccentric. He used to wear a baseball cap with a fake ponytail on the back. Seriously.\n\nFelicity Huffman was not at the premiere. I imagine you\u2019re disappointed that she couldn\u2019t make it.\n\nAll I will say is it would have been lovely to have her here, because she\u2019s so good in the movie. And she\u2019s been really wonderful through the whole thing, even the editing process.\n\nShe goes through a complete transformation for this role. Where did that come from?\n\nYeah, she\u2019s unrecognizable in the film. Jessica Adams, the film\u2019s producer, and I met with her in New York. Felicity took a minute to sort of wrap her brain around the script and then she said, \u201cIf I sign on, I\u2019m going to need to make this decision really quickly because it\u2019s only two months away to shooting and I have work I need to do [before].\u201d And it was like, \u201cGod, what is she going to do for two months?\u201d It was really exciting to me to see who was going to show up on set and she delivered. She does her homework. Watching her, I was like, \u201cI was such a lazy actress.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s go back to Power Rangers. You\u2019ve said that, for a time after that role, you were really trying to escape it. How do you feel about the experience now?\n\nI mean, it was a bad, terrible show.\n\nHey! I grew up with that show and loved it.\n\nYou know what I mean. The acting! You could see the ropes hanging from the [stunt doubles]. It was cheesy. [Laughs.]\n\nBut seriously, looking back now, it was such a gift that fell into my lap. It\u2019s really cool how positively it affected so many kids. I hear stories from people whose parents were going through a divorce and it was their reprieve from that pain. I met this guy named Matt at the last convention I was at. He said when he was a kid, Power Rangers was his best friend because he was so bullied. Then he looks at me and he goes, \u201cThank you for being there before I knew how to laugh.\u201d It was just the sweetest thing anybody has ever said to me.", "description": "Amy Jo Johnson is covering her face with her hands while she tells me about the recent email she accidentally sent Felicity Huffman.
