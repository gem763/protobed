This comes after hitting a 17-year low in July at 4.8%, a figure that missed estimates considerably (Bloomberg reported that estimates were at about 5.2%.)\n\nFor economists, the worry is that this fall in Chinese manufacturing will have a knock-on effect on the US.\n\n\"Manufacturing is in recession,\" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics in a note, who added that it doesn't look like there are any signs of recovery for the US just yet.\n\n\"The sector initially was dragged down by China's cyclical slowdown, but the intensifying trade war is now the dominant factor, dragging down the ISM manufacturing survey even as its Chinese equivalents have stabilized.\"\n\nShepherdson said that usually Chinese manufacturing figures lead ISM by \"two or three months,\" but he warned that currently there are clear red flags as ISM manufacturing hit a 3-month low in August.\n\n\"If the trade war continues for some time, as we expect, then the modest improvement we anticipate in the Chinese manufacturing sector by the early part of next year will not deliver the usual bounce to the US,\" said the economist.\n\n\"For now, we expect US manufacturing output to trend slowly downwards, extending the decline which began in the first quarter,\" he added.\n\nShepherdson also warned that this decline could play a major part when it comes to next year's election cycle.\n\nHe said: \"The weakness of the industrial economy matters disproportionately to markets, the media, and politicians, given the importance of manufacturing-heavy swing states in presidential elections.\"\n\nLast week, the trade war looked like it was starting to thaw as China announced that it would restart its buying of American agricultural goods such as pork and soybeans, while Trump announced he would delay the next round of tariff hikes to mid-October.\n\nLiao Min, China's deputy finance minister will be travelling to the US on Wednesday ahead of talks according to China's Xinhua News Agency. The state-owned agency said that the visit will \"pave the way\" for talks in October.\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics\n\nSee More: Trump's trade war is triggering a 'sharp slowdown' among American small businesses.", "description": "Data released on Monday showed that Chinese industrial production fell in August \u2014 that's after hitting a 17-year low in July, just showing how much...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d80978b2e22af17190d135a-2000/gettyimages-819845162.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
