(Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nA Washington D.C. circuit court upheld on Friday a lower court ruling that the House Oversight Committee is entitled to subpoena President Trump\u2019s financial records.\n\nTrump had appealed the lower court\u2019s ruling but his appeal was rejected in Friday\u2019s decision. The judges rejected the appeal 2-1.\n\nMazars, the accounting firm that handles Trump\u2019s financial records, will now likely be compelled to turn them over to Congress.\n\nTrump has repeatedly refused to publicize his tax returns, despite promising to do so during his 2016 presidential campaign. The refusal has drawn the ire of Democrats, who have tried in vain to force Trump to release his tax returns through the courts.\n\nA Manhattan judge ruled on Monday that Mazars must submit eight years\u2019 records of Trump\u2019s tax returns to the Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., as part of the latter\u2019s investigation into former Trump attorney Michael Cohen\u2019s hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nCohen is currently serving a three year prison sentence for campaign finance violations in connection with the payment. Daniels has said Trump had an affair with her, while Trump has denied the allegation.\n\nJustice Department lawyers tried to block Vance\u2019s subpoena citing presidential immunity from criminal prosecution, but were overruled by federal judge Victor Marrero.\n\nTrump\u2019s defense was \u201crepugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values,\u201d wrote Marrero in his ruling.\n\nDemocrats argue that Trump\u2019s finances should be revealed in order to determine whether Trump is implicated in conflicts of interest stemming from his continued involvement with his business organization while serving in the presidency.", "description": "Trump had appealed the lower court's ruling, however his appeal was rejected in Friday's decision.
