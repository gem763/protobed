Jeff Flake (Ariz.) has a grim warning for Republican lawmakers continuing to support President Donald Trump amid an impeachment inquiry into his solicitation of election assistance from Ukraine: You can find another job, but not another soul.\n\nIn a Washington Post op-ed published Monday, Flake pleaded with members of his party to oppose Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection, even if they cannot back impeachment.\n\n\u201cIf the House decides against filing articles of impeachment, or the Senate fails to convict, Senate Republicans will have to decide whether, given what we now know about the president\u2019s actions and behavior, to support his reelection,\u201d Flake wrote. \u201cObviously, the answer is no.\u201d\n\nFlake has been a frequent critic of Trump, refusing to back him in 2016 and declining to seek another Senate term in 2018, citing the president\u2019s behavior as \u201cdangerous to democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me when I say that you can go elsewhere for a job,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut you cannot go elsewhere for a soul.\u201d\n\nFlake noted he is \u201cnot oblivious to the consequences\u201d of breaking with Trump.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I am living those consequences,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI would have preferred to represent the citizens of Arizona for another term in the Senate. But not at the cost of supporting this man. A man who has, now more than ever, proved to be so manifestly undeserving of the highest office that we have.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) last week announced the impeachment inquiry into Trump after a whistleblower raised alarm over a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A transcript summary of the conversation revealed that Trump repeatedly pressed Zelensky to aid lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr in a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son based on unsubstantiated corruption allegations.\n\nTrump has since railed against the anonymous whistleblower, questioning his patriotism and demanding to meet him in person. He claimed the complaint filed by the individual was \u201cfake,\u201d and the phone call with Zelensky was \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nFlake, noting that Trump\u2019s conduct was unsurprising, slammed the GOP for tolerating it without taking action.\n\n\u201cFrom the ordeal of this presidency, perhaps the most horrible \u2015 and lasting \u2015 effect on our democracy will be that at some point we simply stopped being shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in that, we have failed not just as stewards of the institutions to which we have been entrusted but also as citizens. We have failed each other, and we have failed ourselves.\u201d\n\nDuring an appearance at the Texas Tribune Festival on Thursday, Flake said he believes that at least 35 Republican senators would approve Trump\u2019s ouster if the vote took place in secret.\n\nNow he\u2019s asking Republicans to \u201crisk your careers in favor of your principles,\u201d and cut ties with Trump.\n\n\u201cOur country will have more presidents,\u201d Flake said. \u201cBut principles, well, we get just one crack at those. For those who want to put America first, it is critically important at this moment in the life of our country that we all, here and now, do just that.\u201d", "description": "The Republican former senator urges members of his party to oppose the president's reelection if he's not impeached.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d922e0f2400005f00d51e60.jpeg?cache=kob346wr3w&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
