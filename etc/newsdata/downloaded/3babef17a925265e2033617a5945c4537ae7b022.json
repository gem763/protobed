According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), Turkish-backed forces have swept control of 11 villages and encircled two Kurds-held Syrian towns Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain since President Erdogan launched his offensive on Wednesday to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d.\n\nAt least 10 civilians, including three children, have been killed in Syria, while Turkish officials reported at least six civilians, including a 6-month-old baby, were killed by mortar fire from Syria.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Kurdish forces warned Friday they would have to evacuate a camp west of Ras al-Ayn, sheltering more than 7,000 displaced people from other regions of the country and will move a second camp for 13,000 people including families of Isis fighters after both were hit by shelling.\n\nIn Washington, Andrea Mitchell from NBC TV channel asked officials during a press briefing to address the worries of regional partners including Saudi Arabia and Israel, pushing officials on why US troops were redeployed in northern Syria and if \u201cthe Turkish authorities saw this as a green light\u201d.\n\nThe unnamed official replied: \u201cI\u2019m extremely distressed about this, too. I\u2019m right up there with the Saudis and Bibi Netanyahu. This was a very big mistake and it has very big implications for all of our security.\u201d\n\nThe official added: \u201cI don\u2019t know of anybody who isn\u2019t upset with it. But I also don\u2019t know why anybody thinks that we gave the Turks a green light.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump sparked uproar when late Sunday he announced US troops would step aside in north-eastern Syria and not hinder an imminent Turkish cross-border incursion against the Kurds.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The White House and other branches of the government have since denied that it \u201cgreen-lighted\u201d Mr Erdogan\u2019s offensive.\n\nBut Mr Trump appears to have flip-flopped, at one point defending his withdrawal decision by incorrectly asserting the Kurds \u201cdidn\u2019t help us in the Second World War\u201d. On Thursday he changed tack, tweeting about mediating a deal between Turkey and the Kurds and possibly imposing sanctions on Turkey.\n\n\u201cI hope we can meditate,\u201d he later said when asked about the options by reporters at the White House.\n\nTurkey reported its first fatality during action in Syria in the offensive which has moved into its third day. The Turkish defence ministry said on Friday that three soldiers were wounded, without providing details.\n\nFunerals were held on Thursday for civilians who were killed by Kurdish fire in south Turkey. \u200b\n\nSeparately, the Turkish defence ministry said that it had killed 277 fights from the Kurdish side. The SOHR, however, has said that number is \u201chugely inflated\u201d putting the death toll from the SDF and its allies at around 46.\n\nRights groups have been quick to warn of the potential humanitarian crisis if the fighting continues in north-eastern Syria which is home to some 1.7 million people. The International Committee of The Red Cross warned that there are more than 100,000 people currently being hosted in displacement camps that rely on humanitarian aid and so are at serious risk.\n\nSave The Children, meanwhile, has sounded the alarm about accessing to 8000 foreign children, held in camps for Isis suspects and fighters in the area. Medecins Sans Frontieres warned on Friday, the only public hospital near the frontline has been forced to shut after most of its staff fled from bombings over the past 24 hours.\n\nThere are also concerns the battle between Turkey and Kurdish forces will allow the resurgence of the global jihadist group. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that Isis militants held in northeast Syria could escape from jail because of the operation, the Interfax news agency reported.\n\nKurdish forces at the same time said they were having to move at least one camp holding Isis suspects because of shelling.\n\nThe UK, the European Union, most of the US\u2019s allies in the Middle East including Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the UAE as well as Finland, Denmark and India have joined a chorus of condemnation of Turkey\u2019s military operation.\n\nFrench officials on Friday signalled the EU may even consider sanctions. Back in Washington dozens of President Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives said they would try to introduce legislation to impose sanctions against Turkey.\n\nMr Erdogan has lashed back warning he would \u201copen the gates\u201d and send 3.6 million Syrian refugees to Europe if the EU and others label the offensive an \u201cinvasion.\u201d\n\nEuropean Union Council chief Donald Tusk said Mr Erdogan's remarks were \"totally out of place,\" adding that the EU will never accept \"that refugees are weaponised and used to blackmail us.\"\n\n\n\nMr Tusk urged Turkey to halt the fighting before the conflict triggers a \"humanitarian catastrophe\".", "description": "Senior US officials have admitted they were \u201cextremely distressed\u201d by the pullback of\u00a0US troops in northern Syria,\u00a0calling it a \u201cvery big mistake\u201d, as Turkey pressed ahead with its offensive in\u00a0Syria against Washington\u2019s Kurdish allies.", "authors": ["Bel Trew"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/12/syria-turkey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
