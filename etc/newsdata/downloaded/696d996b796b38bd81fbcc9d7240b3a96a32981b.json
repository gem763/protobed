Actions count, not words. Members of the Iranian government talk, but have no power. Those who have, like the Revolutionary Guard, don't want to negotiate,\" al-Jubeir told the Liberation newspaper in an interview on Thursday.\n\nHe was responding to a question about French attempts to bring the United States and Iran together, including by convincing US President Donald Trump to lift sanctions on Iran.\n\nFailed efforts\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron attempted and failed last month to broker talks between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in New York City at the UN General Assembly.\n\nProspects of any talks in the coming weeks seem slim, with Tehran demanding US sanctions be lifted first.\n\n\"As far as we're concerned, maximum pressure is the only way,\" al-Jubeir said.\n\nWhen asked about the status of talks between Yemen's Saudi-backed government and southern separatists, al-Jubeir said it was crucial to end their differences to ensure focus could turn to battling the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels and al-Qaeda armed group.\n\n\"We are trying to reach peace between the [separatist] Southern Transition Council and the [President Abd-Rabbu Mansour] Hadi government. I think we are close,\" he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has hosted indirect talks between them to rebuild the coalition fighting against the Houthis who expelled Hadi's government from the capital Sanaa five years ago.", "description": "Policy of appeasement will not work with Iran, says Saudi minister of state, dismissing option of US lifting sanctions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/24/937f9c2d8a10401e9eac6e2e875c06ae_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
