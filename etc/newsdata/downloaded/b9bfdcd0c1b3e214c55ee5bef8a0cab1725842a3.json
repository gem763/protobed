China's third-quarter GDP growth was slightly below expectations, Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, said it was not \"a shock to traders and oil trading volumes are low,\" as the weak data had been expected.\n\nAdding to the downward pressure, U.S. crude oil stockpiles surged last week as refinery output dropped to a two-year low, while gasoline and distillate fuel inventories decreased, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. EIA/S\n\n\"It's a bit of tough time for markets because we have questions about supply and demand. Last night's EIA data was a bit of surprise,\" said McCarthy.\n\nU.S. crude inventories increased by 9.3 million barrels in the week ended Oct.11, compared with analysts' expectations for an increase of 2.9 million barrels.\n\nElsewhere, the joint technical committee monitoring a global deal to cut output between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and partners, including Russia, found compliance with cuts for September stood at 236%, according to four OPEC sources. about softer growth in the demand for oil and doubts about OPEC's ability to rebalance the market on the current production cut rate will be key drags on prices in the near term,\" ANZ Research said in a note.\n\nOPEC and its allies have agreed to limit their oil production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2020.\n\nOPEC lowered its 2019 global oil demand growth forecast to 0.98 million bpd, while leaving its 2020 demand growth estimate unchanged at 1.08 million bpd, according to OPEC's latest monthly report.", "description": "UPDATE 1-Oil dips as China posts slowest GDP growth in almost 3 decades", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA8809L_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
