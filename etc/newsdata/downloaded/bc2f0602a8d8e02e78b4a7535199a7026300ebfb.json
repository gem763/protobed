Kiyosaki\u2019s \u201cRich Dad, Poor Dad\u201d (Plata Publishing, $8.99).\n\nThey all have something worthwhile to offer, but after rereading them, I found that all had a glaring omission: a lack of substantive advice on investing. You will have to go elsewhere for an in-depth discussion of how to set up a portfolio and choose among stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds or mutual funds.\n\nWhat all three books do emphasize is the need to buttress your finances by doing such things as reducing debt and expenses. And they share a constant refrain: You are ultimately responsible for your own financial success.\n\nThe authors have different takes on how to succeed, though. Ms. Orman says trust your instincts. Mr. Ramsey says relentlessly eliminate every last shred of debt. And Mr. Kiyosaki says emulate the rich, who have figured out how to \u201chave money work for them.\u201d", "description": "Books by Suze Orman, Dave Ramsey and Robert Kiyosaki don\u2019t tell us much about investing, our reviewer says, but their counsel still has value.", "authors": ["Paul B.
