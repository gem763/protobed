Waters and Walters are MPs. Waters was the deputy chief whip in the Fifth Parliament, but lost out to Jacques Julius for the current Parliament.\n\nShortly before the deadline for nominations closed on Friday, Zille announced that she was in the running, after \"careful consideration and consultation\" and approaches from senior party members in the week.\n\nOn Monday, she told eNCA's morning host Jane Dutton she decided to make herself available firstly, because she was \"asked to\" and secondly, because she believed she could bring \"unity and stability to the party again\".\n\n\"Many people approached me. I can't let the DA simply unravel without putting in a huge and final effort to help stop it,\" Zille said in the interview.\n\n\"If I'm not elected, then I'm not elected, and I'll move on. But if I can have one last chance at making sure we are on track again then I'd like to do that.\"\n\nShe led the party between 2007 and 2015. During this period, the party experienced electoral growth allowing them to govern the Western Cape from 2009 onwards, with Zille as premier until her second term came to an end before this year's election.\n\nA dismal showing at this year's polls places Maimane's leadership under pressure while fissures in the party are seemingly opening up.", "description": "Helen Zille is cleared to run for the position of the Democratic Alliance's chairperson of the federal council, according to the party's presiding officer on council elections.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5089/ea083b4ac6d647c69f9a780f593f9470.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
