She pulled out of the base on the wrong side of the road, apparently forgetting for a moment the rules of left-lane British driving.\n\nDunn had no time to react when Sacoolas came straight at him, the Dunn family spokesman told The Daily Beast. The impact sent him flying over the top of the heavy SUV, causing multiple injuries. He died a few hours later in a local hospital.\n\nAt the scene of the accident, Sacoolas, whose 12-year-old son was reportedly a passenger in the Volvo, was hysterical over what she had done. The car had diplomatic plates, but witnesses who rushed to the crash site told Northamptonshire police that Sacoolas immediately took the blame and gave all her details, including her British and American cellphone numbers.\n\nDMV records in Virginia, where Sacoolas previously was resident, show she had been cited for failing to pay attention while driving in 2006 but had paid the fine with no other penalty. Because Dunn was still alive when he was taken away by ambulance after the accident, Sacoolas was not arrested at the scene\u2014nor was she checked for alcohol or drug use, according to a Northamptonshire Police spokesperson.\n\n\u201c We can confirm the family has left the U.K. \u201d \u2014 U.S. Department of State\n\nWhen police went to the Croughton base the next day to tell Sacoolas that Dunn had died, she was understandably upset and assured them she had no plans to leave the country. When they came back a second time to get more information, she was lawyered up and assisted by officials from the U.S. Embassy to the U.K.\n\nThe police went back again Sept. 15 to place Sacoolas under formal questioning in a wrongful death inquiry but she, her husband, Jonathan, and their three children had left the country, claiming diplomatic immunity. The U.S. Embassy in London said they did so on the advice of the U.S. State Department.\n\nThe Sacoolas family has a home outside Washington, D.C., but they have so far not been spotted there. Calls to the home by The Daily Beast were met with a busy signal. The State Department issued a statement confirming they had left the U.K. but would not confirm where the family is. \u201cWe express our deepest sympathies and offer condolences to the family of the deceased in the tragic Aug. 27 traffic accident involving a vehicle driven by the spouse of a U.S. diplomat assigned to the United Kingdom,\u201d the State Department statement reads. \u201cWe can confirm the family has left the U.K.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Mark Stephens, described as an expert in diplomatic law, told The Guardian newspaper that Jonathan Sacoolas was not listed in London as a diplomat and questioned whether his family indeed had full immunity. U.S. personnel working at Croughton, reportedly a major listening post for the Americans' CIA and National Security Agency, have been granted special diplomatic immunity.\n\nThe British Foreign Office did not respond to a call for confirmation of Sacoolas\u2019 status and whether it should be waived. But the U.S. State Department was quite clear on the matter. \u201cAny questions regarding a waiver of immunity with regard to our diplomats and their family members overseas in a case like this receive intense attention at senior levels and are considered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry,\u201d it said in a statement, adding, \u201cimmunity is rarely waived.\u201d\n\nDunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, was only told last week that Sacoolas had left Britain. She is now pleading that Sacoolas come back to the U.K. to meet with her of her own accord. She isn\u2019t even asking that the supposed spy\u2019s wife be punished for accidentally killing her son.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t understand from one human to another, one mom to another, how you could just get on a plane and leave behind the devastation she has without even speaking to us, without an apology of any kind?\u201d Charles told Sky TV on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re not a horrible family, we\u2019re a usual U.K. family that just need to put a face to\u2014what we have now is a name\u2026 without knowing who this person is properly we can\u2019t begin to try and start our grieving process.\u201d\n\nThe case has rattled the United Kingdom and of course has had a huge impact on the small community where the death took place and where the locals all refer to RAF Croughton as the \u201cspy base.\u201d They are used to mingling with families stationed inside. In fact, the Sacoolas children had just started attending a private school called Winchester House nearby, where Dunn\u2019s father works as head of maintenance.\n\n\u201c I do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose. \u201d \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also involved, promising to take the matter up with President Donald Trump if the American diplomatic process won\u2019t compel Sacoolas to return.\n\n\u201cI do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose,\u201d Johnson told reporters Monday. \u201cI hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country... If we can\u2019t resolve it then of course I will be raising it myself personally with the White House.\u201d\n\nFor the record, Sacoolas and her husband are both registered Republicans. If she does come back, it will likely be of her own free will. It is highly unlikely the American government would force her to return.\n\nNormally, diplomatic immunity is granted only to those working out of the embassy in London under the 1961 Vienna Convention, which is meant to protect families of those working for foreign governments from politically motivated prosecution.\n\nBut in 1994, a special arrangement was reached to extend it to those at RAF Croughton, which is a \u201clistening\u201d post that handles a third of the U.S. intelligence surveillance in the region. Britain\u2019s Independent newspaper reported in 2013, based on documents supplied by whistleblower Edward Snowden, that Croughton is one of two centers for \u201ctech support activity\u201d run by the Special Collection Service (SCS)\u2014a joint CIA/NSA unit that operates a network of about 100 listening posts. Among its reported accomplishments: tapping into the cellphone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\n\u201c President Trump, please listen. We\u2019re a family in ruin. We\u2019re broken. We can\u2019t grieve. Please, please, let her get back on a plane. \u201d \u2014 Charlotte Charles, Harry Dunn\u2019s mother\n\nThat neither Trump nor his State Department have seen fit to waive Sacoolas\u2019 immunity has not stopped Dunn\u2019s family from campaigning for Sacoolas to do the right thing. The family has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money to fight for justice for their son, even if that means traveling to the U.S. to petition Trump in Washington or even to find Sacoolas in person.\n\n\u201cThis funding page is being set up to help the family and his twin brother Niall through these traumatic times,\u201d the campaign note says. \u201cAnd to build up a fund as the family embark on a campaign to search for Justice for Harry as the legal process unfolds.\u201d They have also set up Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook pages under the #justice4harry hashtag where they post articles and information from the family.\n\nIn one message, the family thank well-wishers for showing the respect for Harry they would like from Sacoolas. \u201cHis love for his family and friends outshone everything and made him the caring and loving young man he was,\u201d they write. \u201cIt\u2019s not until now, with all the messages we have received, that we have come to realize how many people\u2019s lives he has touched.\u201d\n\nRAF Croughton would not comment on the matter, but the Dunn family spokesman, Radd Seiger, whose own son was Harry Dunn\u2019s best friend, told The Daily Beast that the family will not stop fighting for justice until Sacoolas is back in the U.K.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump, please listen,\u201d Dunn\u2019s mother said in her interview with Sky TV. \u201cWe\u2019re a family in ruin. We\u2019re broken. We can\u2019t grieve. Please, please, let her get back on a plane, come back to the U.K. We could understand how she\u2019s feeling, but more importantly, she needs to face justice, see what she\u2019s done.\u201d", "description": "Anne Sacoolas fled London, claiming diplomatic immunity\u2014shocking the family of the 19-year-old motorcyclist who was killed.", "authors": ["Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_540,w_960,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570552922/harrydunn_hw38v0", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
