There\u2019s no penalties for bad shots. It\u2019s tough when you come back when it\u2019s like that. I don\u2019t feel like good golf is regarded as well as it could be.\u201d\n\nMcIlroy was previously disappointed by the set up at the Scottish Open at the Renaissance Club in North Berwick in July.\n\nHe shot 13 under par that week and finished equal 34th.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good test,\u201d he said.\n\nWind is usually the best defence for links courses, but both tournaments were played in fairly calm conditions.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether McIlroy\u2019s latest frustration affects his European Tour schedule.\n\nHe almost quit the tour this year to focus solely on the U.S.-based PGA Tour, but subsequently decided to play enough tournaments to maintain his membership and remain eligible for Ryder Cup selection.\n\nMcIlroy has played five times in Europe this year, including the British Open.\n\n\u201cI think if The European Tour want to put forth a really good product, the golf courses and set-ups need to be tougher,\u201d said the four-times major champion.", "description": "Rory McIlroy slammed the European Tour after the final round at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship at St. Andrews on Sunday, saying courses were often too easy to properly test the world's best players.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435312243&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0VA", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
