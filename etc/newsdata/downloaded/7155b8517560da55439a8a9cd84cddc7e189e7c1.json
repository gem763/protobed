Emile Smith Rowe suffered a concussion against Nottingham Forest last week and continues to be assessed. Liege looks like it\u2019ll come too early for him but everybody else is fit for selection.\n\nStriker, Orlando Sa will miss the game for Liege as he has an Achilles injury which has kept him out for the season so far.\n\nOdds\n\nArsenal 4/11\n\nDraw 19/5\n\nStandard Liege 7/1\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nArsenal: Martinez; Bellerin, Mustafi, Holding, Tierney; Torreira, Willock, Ozil; Nelson, Martinelli, Saka\n\nStandard Liege: Milinkovic-Savic; Vojvoda, Bope, Laifis, Gavory; Bastien, Cimirot, M\u2019Poku; Carcela-Gonzalez, Lestienne, Limbombe\n\nPrediction\n\nArsenal will need to win and win well to breed confidence back into Emirates Stadium after a string of indifferent performances. Hector Bellerin and Kieran Tierney returning could breathe new life into the Arsenal attack and give Arsenal something more when trying to impose themselves on the game.\n\nThe Belgians only had five shots in their win over Vit\u00f3ria at home which doesn\u2019t suggest they\u2019ll come out swinging. Arsenal may have to be on the lookout for Maxime Lestienne, however, as he has bagged five goals this term. A 3-1 home win.", "description": "Arsenal are back in Europa League action as they host Standard Liege at Emirates Stadium.
