The official count from the Fire and Disaster Management Agency was 19 dead and 13 missing.\n\nHagibis dropped record amounts of rain for a period in some spots, according to meteorological officials, causing more than 20 rivers to overflow. In Kanagawa Prefecture, southwest of Tokyo, 100 centimeters (39 inches) of rainfall was recorded over the last 48 hours.\n\nSome of the muddy waters in streets, fields and residential areas have subsided. But many places remained flooded, with homes and surrounding roads covered in mud and littered with broken wooden pieces and debris. Some places normally dry still looked like giant rivers.\n\nSome who lined up for morning soup at evacuation shelters, which are housing 30,000 people, expressed concern about the homes they had left behind. Survivors and rescuers will also face colder weather with northern Japan turning chilly this week.\n\nRescue efforts were in full force with soldiers and firefighters from throughout Japan deployed. Helicopters could be seen plucking some of the stranded from higher floors and rooftops of submerged homes.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government will set up a special disaster team, including officials from various ministries, to deal with the fallout from the typhoon, including helping those in evacuation centers and boosting efforts to restore water and electricity to homes.\n\n\u201cOur response must be rapid and appropriate,\u201d Abe said, stressing that many people remained missing and damage was extensive.\n\nDamage was serious in Nagano prefecture, where an embankment of the Chikuma River broke. Areas in Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures in northern Japan were also badly flooded.\n\nIn such areas, rescue crew paddled in boats to each half-submerged home, calling out to anyone left stranded.\n\nTokyo Electric Power Co. said 56,800 homes were still without electricity Monday in Tokyo and nearby prefectures that the utility serves. Tohoku Electric Power Co. said 5,600 homes were without power in Miyagi, Iwate, Fukushima and Niigata.\n\nEast Japan Railway Co. said Hokuriku bullet trains were running Monday but reduced in frequency and limited to the Nagano city and Tokyo route.\n\nAn image of the aerodynamically curved bullet trains sitting in water, was seen by many as a sad but iconic symbol of the typhoon\u2019s devastation.\n\nMimori Domoto, who works at Nagano craft beer-maker Yoho Brewing Co., said all 40 employees at her company had been confirmed safe. But deliveries had temporarily halted, and an event to promote the beer in Tokyo over the weekend was canceled for safety concerns.\n\n\u201cMy heart aches when I think of the damage that happened in Nagano. Who would have thought it would get this bad?\u201d she said.\n\nTama River in Tokyo also overflowed, but damage was not as great as other areas. Areas surrounding Tokyo, such as Tochigi, also suffered damage.\n\nMuch of life in Tokyo returned to normal. People were out and about in the city, trains were running, and store shelves left bare when people were stockpiling were replenished.\n\n___\n\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en", "description": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Rescue crews in Japan dug through mudslides and searched near swollen rivers Monday as they looked for those missing from a typhoon that left", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/13/9c04a7_japan-asia-typhoon-29950-debris-caused-by-typhoon-hagibis-are-left-on-street-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
