But the end of the week has started to provide some clarity to the wave counts.\n\nSo let's get into the review before we get into where we see us heading into this new week.\n\nKey Moments (30 Sep - 4 Oct 2019)\n\nIt was a most interesting week, with lots of major events and headlines. Here are some of the biggest ones from the last 5 days:\n\nANC & Mboweni economic plans - some relief for the as the tabled ideas from Mboweni seem to have been taken on board by the ANC.\n\n- some relief for the as the tabled ideas from Mboweni seem to have been taken on board by the ANC. Eskom & Moody's - the time is ticking toward Moody's review, and Eskom has already been further downgraded.\n\n- the time is ticking toward Moody's review, and Eskom has already been further downgraded. US Economy major downturn - manufacturing and ADP (NASDAQ: ) private-sector data are down...is the next recession starting?\n\n- manufacturing and ADP (NASDAQ: ) private-sector data are down...is the next recession starting? Trade War - rumours around Chinese companies being delisted from US stock exchanges rattled the markets\n\nAs far as the goes, it had a really bad start to the week, losing ground immediately to trade over R15.20, as markets were startled by a report that the US is considering delisting Chinese companies from the US stock exchanges.\n\nThe US Treasury has subsequently denied these rumours, but the volatility continued to wobble markets globally.\n\nChinese out on Monday morning showed the 5th month of contraction but was better than initially forecast. While the US has suffered from the Trade War, it is clear that China is doing so more, and the US has the resources to last out longer. However, a US recession or severe economic downturn would possibly change this advantage that is there over China. Hopefully, the mid-October talks result in some clarity for the markets. Interesting times...\n\nAnd things became even more interesting as US Economic Figures came out during the week:\n\nThe (Institute of Supply Management) manufacturing index fell to 47.8, the worst figure in more than 10 years. Although not recession numbers, the indicator clearly shows at least a slowing in the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\ncame through on Friday at 136k, below the expected 145k - Dollar negative.\n\nDespite this, the unemployment rate dropped to a 50 year low of just 3.5%!\n\nThe came through slightly narrower than June, but the gap with China surged to a 6 month high - surely much to the chagrin of President Trump\n\nSouth Africa also had some big economic figures:\n\nThe South African balance of trade figure for August was released and we saw the trade deficit of R3.72 billion from July turn around to a R6.84 billion surplus. The majority of the turnaround came from a rise in mineral exports leading to a short-term rally for the .\n\nThe manufacturing slump continued, as local figures also fell to a 10-year low.\n\nAs the week went on, the weakened in the midst of all this news, not enjoying the volatility surrounding emerging markets as it hit R15.39 on Wednesday morning, with many investors and importers starting to despair...\n\n...and exporters starting to become overconfident and complacent\n\nUSD/ZAR Chart\n\n...and as so often happens, when it feels things can only get worse (or better), the trend changes.\n\nFortunately, our mid-week update was soon to be published, which would give an outlook for the balance of the week and beyond.\n\nBut, firstly, before we share that, in other news:\n\nFinance Minister Tito Mboweni\u2019s economic reform proposal (which highlights strategies to rescue Eskom) seems to have been taken on-board by the ANC NEC. A very similar proposal was put forward by the NEC for economic recovery and Cyril Ramaphosa has promised that the government will finalise a clear strategy to tackle the country\u2019s economic growth problems. But, it is worth noting that this plan has a very similar colour to the 2011 National Development Plan - little of which has been implemented to this date.\n\nWhich brings us to the SOEs, namely Eskom. Mboweni continues to try to dig it out of a hole but warned the ANC that \"Eskom is not a bank\" as he prepared a funding plan to try and return the stability of the entity. The importance of Eskom surviving cannot be overestimated, as just this analysis from SARB shows just how much damage load shedding does to the country. You can well understand Mboweni's determination to stick to his plan to sell the state-owned companies when these facts come clearer. If Eskom were to fail, it would be a total disaster.\n\nBut rating agencies are running out of patience and time. Fitch Ratings has now downgraded Eskom a further notch, signalling the utility's worsening ability to repay the debt without additional government support.\n\nAnd on the subject of credit rating agencies, we are now 1 month or so away from SA's next review from Moody's, the last standing agency who has kept the investment-grade status for SA. General indications from Moody's have been positive, but investors are taking no chances. At the end of August, overseas ownership of SA government debt fell to 37% from 43% in March 2018. This is now its lowest level since February 2017!\n\nBut to get back to our mid-week update.\n\nWednesday had seen the market hit close to 15.40 (just 10c off the worst levels this year), with many thinking it MUST go higher now.\n\nBy the time this was published around NY close, the market had slightly from its peak earlier in the day, but there was still a lot of nervousness around...\n\nAnd contrary to general expectations, our analysis showed something very different - then the market had likely topped out and was expected to head below 15.05 over the next few days.\n\nUSD/ZAR Short Term Outlook - 2 October 2019\n\nAnd that is exactly what it did!\n\nThe pushed steadily stronger over the next couple of days, and by Friday, we had seen the market drag itself down sub R15.20/$ by the time it was due for the big trigger event of the week: US Non-Farm Payrolls notoriously the biggest trigger of the month in the forex market.\n\nAnd. once again, the event didn't disappoint, as the took the opportunity (on the back of the slightly weaker results than forecast) to push sharply stronger to touch as low as R15.02 exactly as we had forecast on Wednesday evening!\n\nZAR Chart\n\nAnd so, a great finish to the week from the , as it clawed back all it had lost, earlier in the week - plus some!\n\nThe Week Ahead (7-11 Oct 2019)\n\nAs we head into the second week of October, what does the market hold in store?\n\nThere are few economic events that could provide triggers, but no real big ones:\n\nFed Chair speeches (and Trump's response of course)\n\n\n\nspeech\n\nThe big question is of course - can the extend its gains that it made from the extreme of last week?\n\nBased on our latest analysis, the answer is a likely yes, BUT it is not going to be one-way traffic. And we will need to see certain levels broken to confirm a larger degree reversal.\n\nLook forward to sharing my outlook with you.\n\nTo your success~\n\nJames Paynter\n\nOriginal post", "description": "Forex Analysis by Dynamic Outcomes Rand Forecasting Service (James Paynter) covering: USD/ZAR, Automatic Data Processing Inc.
