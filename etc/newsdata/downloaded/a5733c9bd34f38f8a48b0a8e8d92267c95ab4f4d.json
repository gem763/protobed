Such is the case for No. 7 Florida.\n\nFresh off their stirring defeat of Auburn at home, the Gators have to quickly get refocused with a trip to No. 6 LSU coming Saturday. Both teams have exceeded expectations through the first six weeks. The Tigers and their new offense have been outstanding with quarterback Joe Burrow firmly in the Heisman Trophy race.\n\nFlorida has survived the loss of their starting quarterback and enter this unbeaten SEC showdown with one of the nation's top defenses. The winner takes a major step forward in the College Football Playoff race.\n\nLSU quarterback Joe Burrow is talked by Florida defenders during the second quarter of their 2108 game at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.

The Sooners lost this game last season and still made the field. But they don't want to tempt fate a second time. The 11th-ranked Longhorns will look to slow down OU quarterback Jalen Hurts and rely on their own talented signal caller Sam Ehlinger, who has plenty of experience in how to win this grudge match.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nUNLIKELY LEADER: Trask leads No. 7 Florida after not starting in high school\n\nBOWL PROJECTIONS: Ohio State now No. 1 seed for College Football Playoff\n\nThe other two matchups of ranked opponents sees No. 9 Penn State visit No. 18 Iowa and No. 1 Alabama travel to No. 21 Texas A&M.\n\nThe Nittany Lions quietly have won all five of their games and put themselves into contention in the Big Ten East. They'll have to get past what should be an angry group of Hawkeyes who managed just three points in loss to Michigan last week.\n\nThe Crimson Tide haven't yet been tested in their first five games. Could the Aggies surprise? It's possible, though they did not fare well in earlier games against Clemson or Auburn.", "description": "Week 7 of the college football seasons sees major matchups in both the Big 12 and SEC with Oklahoma facing Texas in Dallas and LSU hosting Florida.", "authors": ["Usa Today Sports", "Published A.M.
