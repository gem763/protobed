That\u2019s kind of what\u201d teams look for, Minshew said. \u201cI know I\u2019m right where I\u2019m supposed to be. I wasn\u2019t supposed to go in a higher round. I wasn\u2019t supposed to go to any other team. I\u2019m right where I\u2019m supposed to be and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful to be here.\u201d\n\nNeither could the Jaguars, who gave Nick Foles a four-year, $88 million contract in April with the belief he would solve their two-decade-long search for a quarterback only to see him break his left collarbone in the first quarter of their opener against Kansas City.\n\nEnter Minshew, who completed 22 of 25 passes for 275 yards with two TDs. His completion rate (88 percent) was the highest in league history for any quarterback with at least 15 pass attempts while making his debut.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a fluke, either.\n\nMinshew leads all NFL rookies with five TD throws and his 73.9 percent completion rate and 110.6 passer rating are both the highest by a rookie in his first three games in the Super Bowl era.\n\nMinshew\u2019s path to the pros took him through Troy, Northwest Mississippi Community College, East Carolina and Washington State, where he threw for nearly 5,000 yards with 38 touchdowns last year.\n\n\u201cMinshewmania\u201d has grown with the quirky quarterback\u2019s fashion sense , which ranges from jean shorts, or jorts, Hawaiian shirts and a thick headband to 1970s-style throwback suits as colorful as his personality.\n\n\u201cI have fun, but if you ask anybody in the building, they\u2019ll tell you how hard I work and how serious I do take it,\u201d Minshew said. \u201cI just try to have as much fun as possible and that\u2019s why I play my best, too.\u201d\n\nMinshew revealed this week that he once took a hammer to his right hand at East Carolina in a misguided attempt to extend his college playing career.\n\n\u201cThat was really the only way for me to get a redshirt,\u201d explained Minshew, who failed, fortunately, to break his hand. \u201cLooking back at it, it was pretty dumb. \u2026 But I always tell people, what would you do to play more ball? And that\u2019s damn near anything.\u201d\n\nMinshew said he\u2019s looking forward to meeting Von Miller.\n\n\u201cHopefully it\u2019s after the game\u201d and not in the backfield, Minshew said.\n\nSo far, that hasn\u2019t been a problem for Denver\u2019s opponents because the Broncos are still seeking their first sack and first takeaway even though Miller and Bradley Chubb have played 96 percent of the snaps.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s shocking,\u201d Minshew said. \u201cI know a lot of people that are down on them, but they\u2019re a lot better than what their record says. \u2026 They\u2019ve got some serious talent over there, those two guys on the edges especially.\u201d\n\nOther subplots as the Broncos seek to avoid their first 0-4 start since 1999:\n\nNO SAD SACKS\n\nDon\u2019t expect the Broncos to use all-out blitzes to end their sackless streak. \u201cWhen you look over the years, we\u2019ve coached a long, long time and you\u2019ve got to stay the course and you\u2019ve got to trust in your beliefs,\u201d defensive coordinator Ed Donatell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t go nuts.\u201d\n\nHOMECOMING KING\n\nJaguars DE Calais Campbell was born and raised in Denver. He attended South High, where he played football, basketball and track and field. He has 28 sacks since spurning his hometown team and signing with Jacksonville in 2017.\n\nSCRAMBLED SECONDARY\n\nThe Broncos two free agent DBs are both banged up. Bryce Callahan (foot) is out for at least another month and Kareem Jackson (hamstring) is questionable, meaning another newcomer, Duke Dawson Jr., could get his first significant action.\n\nJALEN RAMSEY\n\nDisgruntled Jaguars star CB Jalen Ramsey could miss a game for the first time in his four-year career after leaving the team to be with his family for the birth of his second child. Ramsey asked for a trade following his blow-up with head coach Doug Marrone on the sideline earlier this month, then said he was sick and had a sore back before taking paternity leave.\n\nMILE HIGH\n\nMinshew isn\u2019t concerned about the altitude in the Mile High City. He played well in Boulder last year in leading Washington State past Colorado 31-7. \u201cWe should have beaten them worse,\u201d Minshew said. \u201cI remember the buffalo - that was freaking awesome - running around the field. That was a lot of fun.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nWith contributions from AP Sports Writer Mark Long.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "He's the real-life Uncle Rico lookalike from Napoleon Dynamite, the \"Mississippi Mustache,\" the rookie whose legend is growing faster than any of the more celebrated quarterbacks taking their lumps on the field or biding their time on the sideline.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/ucla_washington_st_football_26200_c0-241-5760-3599_s1770x1032.jpg?5744a6e428d626295d3fe14d6d300f488e16a9a8", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
