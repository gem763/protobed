The overriding emotion we feel looking at this picture is relief that bushy brows are back for good.\n\nIt\u2019s been a week full of emotional family memories for the Kardashian siblings, after Kim commemorated the death of her late father Robert Kardashian on Monday.\n\nRobert, best known for his work as OJ Simpson\u2019s lawyer, died 16 years ago on 30 September 2003 at the age of 59 following a battle with esophageal cancer.\n\nOn Monday morning, Kim, 38, shared an adorable photo of herself and Kourtney planting a kiss on either side of the lawyer\u2019s cheeks.\n\nAlongside the sweet snap, Kim wrote: \u2018Miss you dad. Can\u2019t believe today would be 16 years since you went to heaven.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
