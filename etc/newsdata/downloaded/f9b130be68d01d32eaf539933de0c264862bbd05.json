In reacting to the mass shooting in Texas over the weekend, Joe Biden told reporters that he knows more about the Second Amendment and the gun-control issue than Texas governor Greg Abbott. And he proved it by complaining about a lack of prohibition on \u201cmagazines that hold multiple bullets,\u201d apparently unaware that magazines exist for precisely that purpose:\n\nOn dealing with firearms, it is irrational with \u2014 all due respect for the governor of Texas \u2014 on the very day you see a mass shooting and we\u2019re talking about loosening access to have guns being able to take them places of worship, store it in school, and it\u2019s absolutely irrational. It\u2019s all about special interests and it has to stop. The idea that we don\u2019t have elimination of assault type weapons, magazines that can hold multiple bullets in them, it\u2019s absolutely mindless. It\u2019s no violation of the Second Amendment. It\u2019s just a bow of special interests of the gun manufactures and the NRA.\n\nAt least he didn\u2019t say \u201cclip\u201d! That\u2019s one small step ahead of some others who lecture gun owners without a clue about the subject matter. This, however, is even more ignorant than usual, since the reason magazines (and clips) exist at all is to allow multiple rounds to be accessed. Anyone with even a passing acquaintance with guns since the front-loading musket would know that. And if you don\u2019t know that, it makes your humble-brag about being an expert in the Second Amendment look even more idiotic.\n\nCome on, Biden\u2019s supporters will cry, take him seriously, not literally. They will argue that we know what Biden meant \u2014 that he was referring to \u201chigh-capacity\u201d magazines, not just magazines in general. Perhaps, but even that seems a bit suspect. First off, has anyone established that this shooting involved so-called high-capacity magazines, or did Biden just jump on a convenient hobby horse without any information? (I know which way I\u2019m betting.) And given the astonishingly small percentage of firearms homicides committed by long-barrel guns, what impact would banning large magazines have, even if we could define what \u201chigh-capacity\u201d means?\n\nAfter all, if it means \u201cmultiple bullets,\u201d then even revolvers would have to be banned, as well as many of the shotguns that Biden recommended for home use. In fact, in light of the seriously-not-literally argument, don\u2019t forget that every piece of self-defense advice that Biden offered in 2013 would get people arrested under current law. With that kind of track record, it\u2019s tougher to take Biden seriously at all \u2014 and to believe that he didn\u2019t mean it literally, too.\n\nStill, it\u2019s difficult to complain in 2019 about seriously-not-literally reverse engineering by leading presidential candidates these days, isn\u2019t it?", "description": "Take him seriously, not literally?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/biden-bullets.png"}
