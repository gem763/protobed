(James Pace-Cornsilk)\n\nThe doorbell-camera company Ring has forged video-sharing partnerships with more than 400 police forces across the United States, granting them potential access to homeowners\u2019 camera footage and a powerful role in what the company calls the nation\u2019s \u201cnew neighborhood watch.\u201d\n\nThe partnerships let police request the video recorded by homeowners\u2019 cameras within a specific time and area, helping officers see footage from the company\u2019s millions of Internet-connected cameras installed nationwide, the company said. Officers don\u2019t receive ongoing or live-video access, and homeowners can decline the requests, which Ring sends via email thanking them for \u201cmaking your neighborhood a safer place.\u201d\n\nThe number of police deals, which has not previously been reported, is likely to fuel broader questions about privacy, surveillance and the expanding reach of tech giants and local police. The rapid growth of the program, which began in spring 2018, surprised some civil liberties advocates, who thought that fewer than 300 agencies had signed on.\n\n[Listen on Post Reports: Reporter Drew Harwell on a video-sharing partnership that some homeowners see as 'a step toward Big Brother']\n\nRing is owned by Amazon, which bought the firm last year for more than $800 million, financial filings show. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.\n\nRing officials and law enforcement partners portray the vast camera network as an irrepressible shield for neighborhoods, saying it can assist police investigators and protect homes from criminals, intruders and thieves.\n\n\u201cThe mission has always been making the neighborhood safer,\u201d said Eric Kuhn, the general manager of Neighbors, Ring\u2019s crime-focused companion app. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of success in terms of deterring crime and solving crimes that would otherwise not be solved as quickly.\u201d\n\nBut legal experts and privacy advocates have voiced alarm about the company\u2019s eyes-everywhere ambitions and increasingly close relationship with police, saying the program could threaten civil liberties, turn residents into informants, and subject innocent people, including those who Ring users have flagged as \u201csuspicious,\u201d to greater surveillance and potential risk.\n\n\u201cIf the police demanded every citizen put a camera at their door and give officers access to it, we might all recoil,\u201d said Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, a law professor and author of \u201cThe Rise of Big Data Policing.\u201d\n\nBy tapping into \u201ca perceived need for more self-surveillance and by playing on consumer fears about crime and security,\u201d he added, Ring has found \u201ca clever workaround for the development of a wholly new surveillance network, without the kind of scrutiny that would happen if it was coming from the police or government.\u201d\n\n\n\nA map of Ring's more than 400 police partnerships. (Courtesy of Ring)\n\nBegun in 2013 as a line of Internet-connected \u201csmart doorbells,\u201d Ring has grown into one of the nation\u2019s biggest household names in home security. The company, based in Santa Monica, Calif., sells a line of alarm systems, floodlight cameras and motion-detecting doorbell cameras starting at $99, as well as monthly \u201cRing Protect\u201d subscriptions that allow homeowners to save the videos or have their systems professionally monitored around the clock.\n\nRing users are alerted when the doorbell chimes or the camera senses motion, and they can view their camera\u2019s live feed from afar using a mobile app. Users also have the option of sharing footage to Ring\u2019s public social network, Neighbors, which allows people to report local crimes, discuss suspicious events and share videos from their Ring cameras, cellphones and other devices.\n\nThe Neighbors feed operates like an endless stream of local suspicion, combining official police reports compiled by Neighbors\u2019 \u201cNews Team\u201d with what Ring calls \u201chyperlocal\u201d posts from nearby homeowners reporting stolen packages, mysterious noises, questionable visitors and missing cats. About a third of Neighbors posts are for \u201csuspicious activity\u201d or \u201cunknown visitors,\u201d the company said. (About a quarter of posts are crime-related; a fifth are for lost pets.)\n\nUsers, which the company calls \u201cneighbors,\u201d are anonymous on the app, but the public video does not obscure faces or voices from anyone caught on camera. Participating police officers can chat directly with users on the Neighbors feed and get alerts when a homeowner posts a message from inside their watched jurisdiction. The Neighbors app also alerts users when a new police force partners up, saying, \u201cYour Ring Neighborhood just got a whole lot stronger.\u201d\n\nTo seek out Ring video that has not been publicly shared, officers can use a special \u201cNeighbors Portal\u201d map interface to designate a time range and local area, up to half a square mile wide, and get Ring to send an automated email to all users within that range, alongside a case number and message from police.\n\nThe user can click to share their Ring videos, review them before sharing, decline or, at the bottom of the email, unsubscribe from future footage-sharing requests. \u201cIf you would like to take direct action to make your neighborhood safer, this is a great opportunity,\u201d an email supplied by Ring states.\n\nRing says police officers don\u2019t have access to live video feeds and aren\u2019t told which homes use Ring cameras or how homeowners responded unless the users consent. Officers could previously access a \u201cheat map\u201d showing the general density of where Ring devices were in use, but the company said it has removed that feature from the video request because it was deemed \u201cno longer useful.\"\n\nRing said it would not provide user video footage in response to a subpoena but would comply if company officials were presented with a search warrant or thought they had a legal obligation to produce the content. \u201cRing does not disclose customer information in response to government demands unless we\u2019re required to do so to comply with a legally valid and binding order,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nRing users consent to the company giving recorded video to \u201claw enforcement authorities, government officials and/or third parties\u201d if the company thinks it\u2019s necessary to comply with \u201clegal process or reasonable government request,\u201d its terms of service state. The company says it can also store footage deleted by the user to comply with legal obligations.\n\n[Aggressive Amazon tactic pushes you to consider its own brand before you click \u2018buy\u2019]\n\nThe high-resolution cameras can provide detailed images of not just a front doorstep but also neighboring homes across the street and down the block. Ring users have further expanded their home monitoring by installing the motion-detecting cameras along driveways, decks and rooftops.\n\nSome officers said they now look for Ring doorbells, notable for their glowing circular buttons, when investigating crimes or canvassing neighborhoods, in case they need to pursue legal maneuvers later to obtain the video.\n\nRing users have shared videos of package thieves, burglars and vandals in the hope of naming and shaming and apprehending the perpetrators, but they\u2019ve also done so for people \u2014 possibly salespeople, petitioners or strangers in need of help \u2014 who knock on the door and leave without incident. (Other recorded visitors include lizards, deer, mantises, snakes and snooping raccoons.)\n\nRing users\u2019 ability to report people as suspicious has been criticized for its potential to contribute to racial profiling and heightened community distrust. Last Halloween in southern Maryland, a Ring user living near a middle school posted a video of two boys ringing their doorbell with the title: \u201cEarly trick or treat, or are they up to no good?\u201d\n\nThe video, which has been viewed in the Neighbors app more than 5,700 times, inspired a rash of comments: Some questioned the children\u2019s motives, while others said they looked like harmless kids. \u201cThose cuties? You\u2019re joking, right?\u201d one commenter said. After The Post shared this video with Ring, the company removed it, saying it no longer fits the service\u2019s community guidelines because \u201cthere is no objective reason stated that would put their behavior in question.\u201d\n\n[As summer camps turn on facial recognition, parents demand: More smiles, please]\n\nSince formally beginning its Neighbors police partnerships with officers in Greenfield, Wis., in March 2018, Ring has extended the program to 401 police departments and sheriff\u2019s offices nationwide, from northwest Washington state to Key West, Fla., company data show. Shortly after this story was published, Ring founder Jamie Siminoff released a blog post saying that count had already expanded, to 405 agencies.\n\nThe partnerships cover vast expanses of major states \u2014 with 31 agencies in California, 57 in Texas and 67 in Florida \u2014 and blanket entire regions beneath Ring\u2019s camera network, including about a dozen agencies each in the metropolitan areas surrounding Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Kansas City, Los Angeles and Phoenix.\n\nSgt. William Pickering, an officer with the Norfolk Police Department in Virginia, which is working with Ring, compared the system\u2019s expansion to the onset of DNA evidence in criminal cases \u2014 a momentous capability, unlocked by new technology, that helps police gain the upper hand.\n\n\u201cWe have so many photojournalists out there, and they\u2019re right there when things happen, and they\u2019re able to take photos and videos all the time. As a law enforcement agency, that is of great value to us,\u201d Pickering said.\n\n\u201cWhen a neighbor posts a suspicious individual who walked across their front lawn, that allows them at that very moment to share that in real time with anyone who\u2019s been watching. Now we have everybody in the community being alerted to a suspicious person.\u201d (A Ring spokeswoman later said this example would be removed from Neighbors because it does not pass the service\u2019s community guidelines, which require \u201can attempted criminal activity or unusual behavior that is cause for concern.\u201d)\n\n[The doorbells have eyes: The privacy battle brewing over home security cameras]\n\nRing has pushed aggressively to secure new police allies. Some police officials said they first met with Ring at a law-enforcement conference, after which the company flew representatives to police headquarters to walk officers through the technology and help them prepare for real-world deployment.\n\nThe company has urged police officials to use social media to encourage homeowners to use Neighbors, and Pickering said the Norfolk department had posted a special code to its Facebook page to encourage residents to sign on.\n\nRing has offered discounts to cities and community groups that spend public or taxpayer-supported money on the cameras. The firm also has given free cameras to police departments that can be distributed to local homeowners. The company said it began phasing out the giveaway program for new partners earlier this year.\n\nPickering said his agency is working with its city attorney to classify the roughly 40 cameras Ring gave them as a legal donation. But some officers said they were uncomfortable with the gift, because it could be construed as the police extending an official seal of approval to a private company.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to push a particular product,\u201d said Radd Rotello, an officer with the Frisco Police Department in Texas, which has partnered with Ring. \u201cWe as the police department are not doing that. That\u2019s not our place.\u201d\n\n[Oregon became a testing ground for Amazon\u2019s facial-recognition policing. But what if Rekognition gets it wrong?]\n\nRing has for months sought to keep key details of its police-partnership program confidential, but public records from agencies nationwide have revealed glimpses of the company\u2019s close work with local police. In a June email to a New Jersey police officer first reported by Motherboard, a Ring representative suggested ways officers could improve their \u201copt-in rate\u201d for video requests, including greater interaction with users on the Neighbors app.\n\n\u201cThe more users you have the more useful information you can collect,\u201d the representative wrote. Ring says it offers training and education materials to its police partners so they can accurately represent the service\u2019s work.\n\nRing officials have stepped up their sharing of video from monitored doorsteps to help portray the devices as theft deterrents and friendly home companions. In one recent example, a father in Massachusetts can be seen using his Ring Video Doorbell\u2019s speakers to talk to his daughter\u2019s date while he was at work, saying, \u201cI still get to see your face, but you don\u2019t get to see mine.\u201d\n\nThe company is also pushing to market itself as a potent defense for community peace of mind, saying its cameras offer \u201cproactive home and neighborhood security in a way no other company has before.\u201d The company is hiring video producers and on-camera hosts to develop user testimonials and videos marketing the Ring brand, with a job listing stating that applicants should deliver ideas with an \u201capproachable yet authoritative tone.\u201d\n\nRotello, who runs his department\u2019s neighborhood-watch program, said Ring\u2019s local growth has had an interesting side effect: People now believe \u201ccrime is rampant in Frisco,\u201d now that they see it all mapped and detailed in a mobile app. He has had to inform people, he said, that \u201cthe crime has always been there; you\u2019re just now starting to figure it out.\u201d\n\nHe added, however, that the technology has become a potent awareness tool for crime prevention, and he said he appreciates how the technology has inspired in residents a newfound vigilance.\n\n\u201cWould you rather live in an \u2018ignorance is bliss\u2019 type of world?\u201d he said. \u201cOr would you rather know what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n[FBI, ICE find state driver\u2019s license photos are a gold mine for facial-recognition searches]\n\nThat hyper-awareness of murky and sometimes-distant criminal threats has been widely criticized by privacy advocates, who argue that Ring has sought to turn police officers into surveillance-system salespeople and capitalize on neighborhood fears.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a business model based in paranoia,\u201d said Evan Greer, deputy director of the digital advocacy group Fight for the Future. \u201cThey\u2019re doing what Uber did for taxis, but for surveillance cameras, by making them more user-friendly. \u2026 It\u2019s a privately run surveillance dragnet built outside the democratic process, but they\u2019re marketing it as just another product, just another app.\u201d\n\nRing\u2019s expansion also has led some to question its plans. The company applied for a facial-recognition patent last year that could alert when a person designated as \u201csuspicious\u201d was caught on camera. The cameras do not currently use facial-recognition software, and a spokeswoman said the application was designed only to explore future possibilities.\n\nAmazon, Ring\u2019s parent company, has developed facial-recognition software, called Rekognition, that is used by police nationwide. The technology is improving all the time: Earlier this month, Amazon\u2019s Web Services arm announced that it had upgraded the face-scanning system\u2019s accuracy at estimating a person\u2019s emotion and was even perceptive enough to track \u201ca new emotion: \u2018Fear.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFor now, the Ring systems\u2019 police expansion is earning early community support. Mike Diaz, a member of the city council in Chula Vista, Calif., where police have partnered with Ring, said the cameras could be an important safeguard for some local neighborhoods where residents are tired of dealing with crime. He\u2019s not bothered, he added, by the concerns he has heard about how the company is partnering with police in hopes of selling more cameras.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s America, right?\u201d Diaz said. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to put bad guys away?\u201d\n\nDig Deeper: Personal tech + Privacy\n\nWant to learn about how to keep your personal information private?
