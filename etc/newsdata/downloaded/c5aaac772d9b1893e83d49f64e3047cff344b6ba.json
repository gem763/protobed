He first wrote it back in 2011, as a break from attempts to get financing for The Lost City of Z, his period epic about exploring the Amazon. At the time, he was jonesing to make a new movie \u2014 he had released the crime epic We Own the Night in 2007 and the romantic drama Two Lovers in 2008, both starring Joaquin Phoenix. \u201cI tried to write an exploration movie in space, just trying to do something personal,\u201d Gray recalls. That \u201csomething personal\u201d eventually wound up becoming the most ambitious and difficult film of the director\u2019s career: a space epic starring Brad Pitt as an astronaut sent to Neptune to find his long-lost father, played by Tommy Lee Jones.\n\nAfter premiering in Venice last month and coming out in theaters this past weekend, the movie has become the topic of raging debates among moviegoers, many of whom argue both about What It All Means, and whether it\u2019s any good. (Our David Edelstein called it \u201ceerily, transfixingly beautiful.\u201d I would agree.) Throughout the film, Gray contrasts his protagonist\u2019s subdued, emotionally constipated behavior with a voiceover that speaks to his regrets and resentments. Sometimes subtle and sometimes painfully earnest, the movie is a portrait of a deeply conflicted man \u2014 that\u2019s perhaps not always satisfying in conventionally dramatic ways.\n\nGray himself is among the sincerest of interview subjects, a man who will openly discuss what he was trying to accomplish with certain scenes in his pictures, as well as whether he thinks he achieved it or not. He\u2019s also kind of like the world\u2019s most entertaining film professor, a constant fount of movie references who will happily break down some of the classics to explain how they work. Over the course of our conversation, he did both, opening up about his career, his mistakes, his favorite movies, and the challenges of making Ad Astra.\n\nWith space movies these days, we hear a lot about all the scientific research that goes into them. Was that the case for you?\n\n\ufeffOh, yes, a huge amount. I had dinners with astronauts at my house. I\u2019m really in awe of those people. They have incredible bravery. I met a woman who hopefully is going to be one of the first female astronauts to walk on the moon in 2024, which is when we\u2019re going back. I was talking to her and she said, \u201cWell, I flew on the shuttle a couple of times, and I was on ISS for like 179 days.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat? If I don\u2019t have access to my type of dry pasta for, like, a week, I get rabies.\u201d\n\nI really enjoyed the research. When we shot the Rover sequence on the moon and also the Rover on Mars, we shot them in the desert, but when I saw the footage, I had a heart attack, because the desert has a lot more vegetation and life than you realize. It doesn\u2019t look like the moon, or Mars. So I said, \u201cWell what do we do?\u201d JPL [the Jet Propulsion Lab] gave us their high-res images of the moon and of Mars. So in the movie, the surfaces of the ground are moon and Mars. So you\u2019re basically watching the first movie shot \u201con location\u201d on Mars!\n\nBut I did get things wrong, usually because the science got updated. For example, the idea is correct that you have to stop on the moon to go to Mars. Why? Because the gravitational pull of the moon is one-sixth of Earth. In order to leave orbit on the moon, you need much less thrust. Your rocket doesn\u2019t have to be as big. You don\u2019t need as much fuel. So when they go to Mars, they\u2019re going to use something called the Gateway that\u2019s in loose orbit on the moon. I got that right. What I didn\u2019t get right was that they\u2019re going to launch it from the orbit of the moon as opposed to the surface of the moon, which is what they thought they were going to do in 2017.\n\nThis film took a long time to finally come to theaters. Why was that?\n\n\ufeffA couple of things. One, the picture edit itself was difficult. I was asked yesterday, how different is my first cut from this? Not very. The structure is pretty straightforward. The thing that was difficult is a lot of the world creation with visual effects. You\u2019re having to create a lot of those shots from scratch. You\u2019re having to sign off on animation, which then gets rendered, and then you have to cut it into the stuff you\u2019ve already shot. And if it doesn\u2019t fit, you have to redo it. It is endless.\n\nBut also, let\u2019s be honest, the studio got purchased by another studio. Disney bought the studio, and they they couldn\u2019t release two movies of their own on the same day. By the way, I was thrilled, because I thought the film was much more of a fall movie, and I got more time to work on the effects \u2026 But it is also true that you now have one studio controlling 40 percent of the marketplace, and I don\u2019t know what that means. So when people say, \u201cWhere\u2019s your movie?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cHave you read the newspaper?\u201d\n\nThis is your first film with a lot of effects. Did that change your working methods?\n\nIn order to trick the eye \u2014 for zero-gravity scenes and things like that \u2014 just the amount of effects work, and how you have to shoot the scenes, is very irritating. You can\u2019t create a continuity if you have to shoot the close-ups and then two weeks later you go into the vertical set and you shoot the wide shots. You have Brad by himself up on wires, 40 feet up. I do think the film has consistency, because, of all the things I might\u2019ve screwed up, I was able to keep my eye on the ball of what the film was going to be. But it turned out to be much more arduous.\n\nSometimes, it seems that the stuff you worry about a lot in advance turns out to be the stuff that\u2019s actually okay. And then the stuff that you don\u2019t worry about \u2014 that\u2019s what actually gets you.\n\nI wish that were true in my case, because then the whole movie would be okay. I\u2019m just constantly worried about everything! But it is true in some sense. This is one of the brutalities of context: You\u2019ll be making a film and you\u2019ll shoot a scene and think, \u201cThis is going to be a throwaway scene.\u201d Obviously, you always try to do your best, but you think it\u2019s not an important scene. And, then, there are other days you go, \u201cGeez, the scene is so critical.\u201d And then you get into the editing room and you find that the scene which didn\u2019t really mean very much is of paramount importance in the film, and the one that seemed critical \u2014 cutting-room floor. You have 10,000 decisions to make, basically. And you can make 9,998 correct. But if you make two wrong decisions on two scenes you really need, the film could be destroyed.\n\nCan you think of times when that\u2019s happened to you?\n\nI can cite exactly what mistakes I\u2019ve made. I\u2019ll give you an example, and it\u2019s in the film that\u2019s my favorite (I say \u201cmy favorite\u201d not because I think it\u2019s the best, but because of the experience I had, and the actors I loved, and where I was shooting it): I made a big mistake on The Immigrant, dramatically, which I think we kind of fixed, but we had to do it with sound, with looping and cutting around it. Jeremy Renner gets killed and [Marion Cotillard\u2019s character] doesn\u2019t immediately go to him. If you watch the film, she goes like this [lurches forward]. So we were able to cut it in a way that sort of implies that she does go to him. But that was a big dramatic mistake I made for her character, and I had to fix it in the editing room. You really want to go through with this?\n\nI love this. Filmmakers always see the mistakes, it seems.\n\nOkay. Huge dramatic mistake in Two Lovers: Joaquin is with Vinessa Shaw\u2019s character at her brother\u2019s bar mitzvah, and he gets a phone call from Gwyneth, which in the movie, he doesn\u2019t take. And then later, he calls her up to find out she\u2019s in trouble. But the way I shot it, he left the bar mitzvah right then and there, which made him into a creep. That almost wrecked the film. Once I saw the film cut together, I knew I had to fix that.\n\nBut no movie is flawless. What you hope is that the force of the film, the through line, is strong enough that you can accept the inevitable flaws. So for example \u2026 [Federico Fellini\u2019s] La Strada is one of my favorite movies ever, and weirdly, [Giulietta Masina\u2019s character] dies off screen, and there\u2019s this awkward thing where Anthony Quinn just happens to hear the news in some random place, where a woman knows that Giulietta Masina has died. It\u2019s narratively awkward, but you don\u2019t care.\n\nIt\u2019s a really powerful moment!\n\nIt\u2019s incredible. We\u2019re not talking about real flaws, we\u2019re saying \u201cflaws.\u201d [Laughs] Here\u2019s something that\u2019s a flaw that works brilliantly for one of my favorite movies of all time: If you look at Raging Bull, it\u2019s very elliptical in how it plays. And his first wife \u2026 ding \u2026 out of the movie! Right? And that\u2019s never resolved. Now, that\u2019s a \u201cflaw.\u201d But it\u2019s not. The movie succeeds because of the power of the idea, and De Niro\u2019s performance, and the personal commitment that Scorsese had. But also because the film feels like episodes out of Jake LaMotta\u2019s life. And those ellipses are bold and brilliant.\n\nI have no idea if this is at all intentional, but I noticed that Ad Astra opens with almost a reversal of the ending of 2001. First image, you have Brad Pitt\u2019s face, in a helmet, almost in the same configuration as the Star Child in the final shot in 2001. And then you pan to Earth, which is the opposite of what Kubrick does. It made me think, \u201cAm I watching the promise of the Star Child transformed into the figure of a sad, middle-aged man?\u201d\n\nThat is totally unintended! I never thought about that. Wow, that\u2019s so weird. No, Brad\u2019s image is in that opening shot because I wanted to imply that it was almost like a dream that he was having. And also to allow the audience to understand that it was a myth of man, not a myth of the gods.\n\nSo in that sense, it actually does kind of work as a reverse of 2001, no?\n\nI\u2019ve been asked about 2001 a lot over the last six weeks. It\u2019s one of the top five movies of my life, and I always was intrigued by how it operated because it was called \u201cA Space Odyssey.\u201d I\u2019ve spoken to this before, but it doesn\u2019t play as a myth of man, because you don\u2019t know Keir Dullea really at all. You have an affinity for Hal [the computer], actually, much as you kind of feel bad for the Cyclops in The Odyssey. Even though you could tell Kubrick was trying to adhere to the idea of myth \u2014 as many filmmakers were in the \u201960s, sort of discovering Joseph Campbell\u2019s book The Hero with a Thousand Faces \u2014 one gets the sense that he wasn\u2019t totally successful in that realm, and then decided to push the film into a more abstract myth of the gods. It works genius in that way; again, a flaw becomes a strength. Consciously, we were trying to make the opposite \u2014 to make The Odyssey, but from Telemachus\u2019s point of view; Odysseus goes off for 20 years, and the son is left to wonder. I mean, it ends differently. But that was the impetus of the idea.\n\nIt\u2019s also kind of the opposite of The Lost City of Z, which ends with a son going off with his father in search of the lost city, and they vanish.\n\nYou kind of make the same movie over and over again, but in a different guise, because you change. I\u2019m a different person than I was when I made my first film. And so that takes care of the films feeling different. You just try to focus on what it is you care about. I was very interested in fathers and sons. I\u2019m not estranged from my father, thank heavens. But all relationships between father and son are very complicated relationships. Of course, with mother and son, and mother and daughter, and father and daughter \u2026 it\u2019s all fraught, no matter how good we think it is. That makes drama. And it\u2019s a shorthand. If I say to you, \u201cTommy and his friend, Bob \u2026,\u201d well, I have to go through hoops to explain to you that relationship. Why are they friends? When did they meet? What\u2019s the nature? Does one look up to the other? But in a movie, if I say \u201cfathers and sons,\u201d you know exactly what I\u2019m saying. There is a baggage.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example. In The Godfather, you have no scene between Brando and Pacino until the end. There\u2019s a moment where he says, \u201cI\u2019m with you, Pop\u201d in the hospital, but Brando doesn\u2019t talk back to him, right? He barely sees him at the wedding, and then at the end, in the garden. But you don\u2019t need more. Why? Because we make a basic series of culturally coded assumptions about what it means to be a father and what it means to be a son.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s also why, when De Niro and Pacino \u2014 who played father and son in The Godfather Part II in separate timelines, so they didn\u2019t actually share any screen time together \u2014 finally were onscreen together in Heat, they already had so much baggage?\n\nOh, I never thought about that. That gives it a weird kind of unity, doesn\u2019t it? Because Heat in some ways owes a great deal in structure to The French Connection. But The French Connection gets dramatic unity because it becomes about class: Gene Hackman in this porkpie hat, eating the pizza outside, while Charnier (Fernando Rey), with his beard, is elegantly eating in this fabulous French restaurant. Heat doesn\u2019t have that. But it still does have some kind of unity, and maybe it\u2019s the myth. Maybe it\u2019s the iconography of those two actors.\n\nWatching Ad Astra, I\u2019m also reminded of the car chase from We Own the Night, where Joaquin Phoenix has to watch from one car as his father is killed in the other. The idea of watching your all-powerful father become helpless and small in your eyes.\n\nI hadn\u2019t thought of We Own the Night very much, but it makes perfect sense. I mean, in some ways, Ad Astra is also the opposite of that movie, because I always felt that We Own the Night was way more tragic than people perceived. It wasn\u2019t about Joaquin Phoenix becoming a cop and how terrific that was. It was about how he could not step out from under the shadow of his father and brother, and how he wound up becoming the same thing that they were. Ad Astra I think is much more optimistic, in a sense, because Brad is able to cut the umbilical, and transcend.\n\nBut there\u2019s that little moment near the end of Ad Astra where we see things from the father\u2019s point of view \u2014 after we\u2019ve spent the entire movie inside the son\u2019s perspective. The father is the one who tells him to cut the cord. He\u2019s the one who\u2019s like, \u201cLet me go.\u201d\n\nBecause the whole movie is so Brad\u2019s point of view, we thought for that one moment, he becomes a child again. It\u2019s why I staged it where he\u2019s looking up. He has to look up to the father, in both literal and figurative terms. And then you\u2019re quite right, out in space, there\u2019s a strange power dynamic that happens there. But that was also very mythic, the atonement with the father. That the father wasn\u2019t just the ogre \u2014 that there was also something beautiful about his dream, as insane as it is. And how lost he was. If you\u2019ve ever had to deal with a parent who is addled in some way, with Alzheimer\u2019s or some illness like that, it\u2019s so heartbreaking because there\u2019s a dance you have to do where you are the child, and then you are the parent to the child, and it\u2019s very painful. I was hoping that it would come out in Brad\u2019s performance.\n\nHis performance, which is excellent, seems like it was quite a challenge. The character is so closed off. Outwardly, he\u2019s so professional, calm. But you have to get across that he has this pent-up rage, and this weird contempt for the people around him. All the while he maintains the veneer of this classic, soft-spoken, professional astronaut played by Brad Pitt.\n\nYou do have moments where you get signs that he\u2019s fucked up. When they tell him his father may be out there, there\u2019s a look of serious panic on his face. Kind of like, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d And from that moment on, we wanted to have this debate where he would be in denial, \u201cThat\u2019s not my father. He\u2019s not alive.\u201d And internally, \u201cIs he alive?\u201d Externally, \u201cI have a mission.\u201d\n\nNow, is it enough? It is for me. It is for Brad. It is for people who connect with the film. It isn\u2019t for people who don\u2019t. You always take some measure of risk. With enough context, you can get away with \u2014 not underplaying, but playing it softly, if that makes sense.\n\nIs that where the art lies? In giving us just enough, but not so much that we feel like we\u2019re just being lectured to?\n\nThat\u2019s the challenge, because sometimes you are lectured to and people like it, and sometimes you aren\u2019t and people like it. There\u2019s no right way to approach it. It\u2019s funny, my wife had bought, before I even knew her, Pauline Kael\u2019s book, For Keeps, which is a collection of her reviews. I picked it up at random \u2026 I was reading her review of Raging Bull, which is very negative. For her, the clearly overt characterization, his whole kind of persona, was too much. I don\u2019t agree, obviously. I think it\u2019s brilliant. But for her, it was too much. So it\u2019s such a taste issue. And I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some people who see Ad Astra and say, \u201cWhere\u2019s the acting?\u201d I just felt it was honest, and we gave enough moments where you see the other side of that. When he gives the message to his dad, on Mars, he\u2019s clearly troubled by it and punching a wall.\n\nHow do you work with an actor to get vulnerable moments like that?\n\nYou try to create the space where the actor feels free, and is okay with being vulnerable. And then you do a bunch of takes and you see where it lies and you try to push him or her. You try to use triggers.\n\nWhat kind of triggers?\n\nWell, I\u2019m not really comfortable talking about the triggers I used with Brad. That\u2019s personal. But it depends on how the actor works. It\u2019s a good question. Some actors work in a very [Lee] Strasberg sort of way, which is substitution. In other words, \u201cI\u2019m playing Joan of Arc, I\u2019ve never actually burned to death, but if I put my hand on the candle and I feel what that feels like for 30 seconds, and how painful that is, I can use that.\u201d So some actors work that way. Other actors use total make-believe. Other actors work from the outside in; the costume becomes the person. So it\u2019s incumbent on you to recognize what kind of actor you\u2019re working with, what their strategy is, and then to help them. It\u2019s why the first week of shooting is so hard, because you\u2019re just sussing out how the actor works. How do you trigger a performance? That\u2019s also why \u2014 I\u2019m about to say something controversial, maybe you should stop me.\n\nNo, no. Go for it.\n\nIt\u2019s why good work sometimes is ugly. Francis Coppola is giving Martin Sheen triggers [in Apocalypse Now], and some people would say he\u2019s torturing him, goading him, so when he punches that mirror, his actual blood, his real blood, is all over his fist and face. Social media would have torn Francis apart now. But to do good work, sometimes that\u2019s demanded. Or what [John] Cassavetes did to Lynn Carlin on Faces and Gena Rowlands. I don\u2019t know if that would survive today. I\u2019m not arguing that we should all beat each other up and torture each other and punch mirrors and all that. The set is a sacred place, because you are going to confront some demons. You\u2019re going to have to reveal the private moment, the most vulnerable moment, and in order to trigger the performance you want, you have to take those kinds of risks. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll survive the social media explosion.\n\nWell, who knows if the social media explosion itself will survive?\n\nWho knows if the human race will survive?\n\nSpeaking of which, I like the little hints you give about the dystopian world in Ad Astra. Like the fact that Brad Pitt is a veteran of the War in the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe whole moon sequence was meant to be about that. And the baboon, too. There are a few essential truths, it seems, about human nature. I\u2019m a believer in progress, but if you had to chart it, it would sort of go like this [makes an up-and-down zigzagging motion with his hand]. It\u2019s not a steady line upwards. It\u2019s like \u2026 the telephone! And then \u2026 Hitler! The problem is that we do live better than we did in 1300, when you worried about Black Plague and the average person lived until he or she was like probably what, 28 years old? So, life is better. But there is at any given time over a hundred wars in the world still. What does that tell you? There are core aspects to our nature which are not ideal. And we carry that with us.\n\nSo we colonize the moon and, sure enough, there are now moon pirates?\n\nIf you think about the logic of that: You\u2019re going to need to eat when you get up there, right? You can\u2019t have grass-fed beef, there\u2019s no grazing. Can you grow vegetables and fruits in one-sixth gravity? So then ask yourself, what would be on the moon? It would probably be processed food, artificial meat. It would be fast food, because they\u2019re the pros of processed food and artificial meats. That\u2019s why Subway is there. And then huge parts of the moon might be very rich in natural resources, but what country, what nation-state, gets what region? And then, what do you do when you find huge natural resources in one region that you didn\u2019t in another on the moon? You may have international treaties, but how do you enforce them? So there are basic core truths to the moon\u2019s situation and core truths to who we are. How do you bridge that gap? I don\u2019t think we do. We tried to communicate that inevitability.\n\nThis is also communicated in Roy\u2019s journey, right? There\u2019s a body count wherever he goes.\n\nHe\u2019s an angel of death! The whole crew dies under his watch.\n\nBut all throughout, everybody tells him, \u201cYou\u2019re Clifford McBride\u2019s son? It\u2019s an honor to meet you.\u201d And finally we get to Ruth Negga, on Mars, who\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re Clifford McBride\u2019s son? That fucking guy killed my parents.\u201d It\u2019s like all that propriety has finally been stripped away. Here\u2019s this person who\u2019s lived her whole life on Mars, and has only seen Earth once in her life, and she does not have time for any of these niceties.\n\nShe bestows upon him a kind of wisdom and clarity, and the myth of the benevolent father is stripped away for good, and the ogre father takes its place. She\u2019s a very wonderful actress, Ruth Negga. She was always saying to me, \u201cDarling, tell me what it is, why I\u2019m telling him this bad news?\u201d And I said, \u201cYou are the oracle. You are the person of wisdom talking to this man-child, educating him.\u201d If I may be pretentious, yet again, that was our attempt to do a Campbellian thing. In his book he has a chapter on meeting with the goddess. But we also wanted to give her her own humanity. Because this is a very tragic element of her life: She\u2019s born in that place where you have to live underground, which is awful. She has this terribly unresolved thing herself.\n\nBut if Tommy Lee Jones had discovered alien life, it would all seem justified. We\u2019d think, He did what he had to do to get to this moment.\n\nWell, let me ask you a question. If you were searching for something your whole life and you finally found it, what does that mean? That\u2019s its own trouble, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s partly what I was trying to express with Lost City of Z as well, this idea that finding the city was not really what the movie was about at all. The movie is ultimately about the search, and how you dedicate your life to the idea of a goal. It\u2019s the same way with filmmaking. You find pleasure in the doing.\n\nOne time, if I may drop his name, I had this fantastic conversation with Martin Scorsese, and he was talking about La Strada and he said, \u201cI wish I could make a movie like that.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYou\u2019ve made incredible movies, maestro.\u201d And he said, \u201cI never made anything like that.\u201d I think the tragedy of Tommy Lee\u2019s character is that he never found a pleasure in the beauties that he discovered. He never found beauty in the idea that human beings are what matter. The idea of striving is what matters.", "description": "James Gray doesn\u2019t know if the human race will survive, but he can spot all the mistakes in Ad Astra.", "authors": ["Bilge Ebiri"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/24/24-ad-astra.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
