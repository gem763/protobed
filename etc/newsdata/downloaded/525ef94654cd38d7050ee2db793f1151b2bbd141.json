It's about time", "language": "en", "text": "Here are some of the other organisations and businesses recorded on the Fair Work Commission website for underpaying employees: the ABC, Maurice Blackburn, Caltex, 7-Eleven, Subway, Bunnings, Sunglass Hut, The Ironing Shop, The Barry Caf\u00e9, FoodCo, Muffin Break, Jamaica Blue, United Petroleum, Coffee Club, Thales Australia, Shangri-la Hotel, Hello Juice, Sushi 79, Safecorp Security, Tokyo Sushi, Westside Petroleum, PappaRich, JB Hi-Fi, Crust Pizza, Minor DKL Food Group, Michael Hill Jewellers, Beaurepaires and more.\n\nThe telling point here is the first two names \u2013 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (which underpaid 2500 employees) and the specialist workplace relations law firm Maurice Blackburn (which underpaid 400 employees). Both got their pay wrong. So, for those that scream wage theft and demand jail time for business owners, the question is \u201cwho will go to jail from Maurice Blackburn?\u201d Will it be one partner or all the partners? Will Ita Buttrose go to jail or will it be the general manager of the ABC, or both?\n\nIf it is true, as the unions argue, that the system isn\u2019t too complicated, then it can only mean Maurice Blackburn deliberately underpaid their workers. Because if anyone would get it right it would be the legal attack dog of the unions, the law firm that claims to represent the worker and claims to know all the rules. Wesfarmers and the ABC have huge HR departments and payroll teams so did they deliberately underpay their staff? No, they didn\u2019t. Neither did Maurice Blackburn, and neither did most of the companies mentioned above. Some did and have been duly prosecuted, but they are the exceptions not the rule.\n\nThe system is plainly too complicated. We support Porter in his step-by-step approach to see what changes to the system are needed, and then to make it easier to comply.\n\nA balanced approach will also hopefully stop the strident accusations of \u2018\u2018WorkChoices revisited\u2019\u2019 every time a Coalition government tries to do something. The necessary changes need to be introduced through a structured process. A balanced crossbench in the Senate also augurs well.\n\nThere would not only be greater transparency if the system were simplified, but regulation would also become easier. Simple systems create fewer mistakes and the dishonest few have less chance to game the system and a greater chance of being caught and brought to justice.\n\nWe want a system where the employer and employee can look at the same smart device and easily find the relevant information. A system in which information is easy to understand will mean a more harmonious workplace.\n\nWith constant changes in technology and the disruption of so many business systems, maybe we can have an Uber-IR system that provides the information we need instantly and without ambiguity? That would be nice.", "description": "Respectable companies underpaying staff says more about an over-complex workplace system than avarice.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3203%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/30ea03f509f0247f86378761297b1b87142b8dc8", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
