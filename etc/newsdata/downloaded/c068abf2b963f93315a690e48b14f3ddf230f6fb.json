We are playing a different brand of football, more attacking.\n\n\u201cI like the way he (Sarri) wants the team to play. We are creating more opportunities, we have more confidence in ourselves, I\u2019m happy with these changes.\n\n\u201cMaybe we could score a little more but I\u2019m proud of what we are doing.\u201d\n\nSo far this season, Ronaldo has scored five goals in nine games and was on target at the weekend when Juventus beat Bologna 2-1 to consolidate top spot in Serie A.\n\n\u201cMy role hasn\u2019t changed, perhaps I have a bit more freedom,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am happy because, bit by bit, we are getting to where Juventus ought to be. We have a difference coach, a different system, new players. We changed in order to improve.\u201d\n\nLast week, the five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner scored his 700th career goal while playing for Portugal.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s already in the past.
