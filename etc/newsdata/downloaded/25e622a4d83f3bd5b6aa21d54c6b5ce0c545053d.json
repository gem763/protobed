(Photo: Getty)\n\nSINGAPORE \u2014 A man who masturbated and urinated into female residents\u2019 shoes at HDB blocks was on Thursday (24 October) fined $5,000 at the State Courts.\n\nLow Yan Long, 34, pleaded guilty to two charges of doing an obscene act in public.\n\nLow, who held part-time jobs at a casket company and a fast-food restaurant, also admitted to two counts of mischief and causing damage to property which were considered in sentencing.\n\nThe court heard that Low had been feeling stressed due to work and family matters, and turned to looking for women\u2019s shoes at HDB blocks.\n\n\u201cThe accused did so because he was sexually aroused when he saw and smelt ladies shoes as he would imagine beautiful women wearing the shoes,\u201d said Deputy Public Prosecutor Joshua Foo.\n\n\u201cWhen he found such shoes, he would masturbate and urinate in the shoes as a way to relieve stress,\u201d the prosecutor added.\n\nMasturbated into shoe\n\nOn 22 January, Low went to a HDB block in Toa Payoh after work.\n\n\u201cFeeling stressed due to pressures at home, the accused decided to masturbate with a lady\u2019s shoe to relieve his stress. Thus, he went up to the said block in search of a lady\u2019s shoe to masturbate with,\u201d said DPP Foo.\n\nAt about 7pm, he found a pair of shoes placed outside a home. Low picked up the footwear and went to the staircase landing, where he unzipped his pants and used a handkerchief to cover his groin area.\n\nHe placed his penis in one of the shoes and masturbated before leaving the shoes at the staircase landing and leaving the scene.\n\nAt about 9pm, the shoe owner\u2019s husband was told by a neighbour about the footwear at the staircase landing.\n\nThe husband reviewed footage from the CCTV outside his home, which captured Low doing the obscene act. He reported the matter to the police at a neighbourhood police centre two days later. Low was arrested a week later, on 30 January.\n\nThe shoes were eventually thrown away.\n\nUrinated into shoe\n\nWhile out on bail for the earlier offence, Low went on to commit a similar crime.\n\nOn 28 July, Low\u2019s colleague at the casket company dropped him off at a bus stop in Ang Mo Kio after work. He then walked to a HDB block closest to the bus stop.\n\nAt about 12noon, Low went looking for a pair of shoes to masturbate with. After a 20-minute search, he came across a pair of red shoes placed on a shoe rack outside a unit.\n\nLow picked up one of the shoes, smelt it, unzipped his pants and rubbed his penis on the shoe. He then urinated into the shoe, before placing it back onto the shoe rack and leaving the scene.\n\nHis actions were captured on a CCTV camera installed outside the home of the shoe owner\u2019s neighbour.\n\nThe shoe owner\u2019s husband was told by the neighbour that someone had urinated into his wife\u2019s shoe. The husband then viewed the CCTV footage and called the police.\n\nLow was arrested the next day after he attended a court mention in relation to the 22 January incident.\n\nA government psychiatrist found that Low was not suffering from any mental illness and that his offences were \u201cthe result of his dysfunctional and sexually deviant way of dealing with stress\u201d.\n\nDistrict Judge Seah Chi-Ling allowed Low to pay his fine in instalments until April. If he fails to cough up the amount, he will have to serve a four-week jail term.\n\nThe maximum punishment for doing an obscene act in public is up to three months\u2019 jail along with a fine.\n\nOther Singapore stories:\n\n1.4M Singaporeans to receive Bicentennial Bonus\n\nLotte Duty Free awarded deal to run liquor and tobacco stores in Changi Airport, launch in June 2020\n\nFruitful stint for Garie Tang, who earned scholarship to train at UFC performance institute in Shanghai\n\nExtended operating hours for SMRT trains, buses on Deepavali eve\n\nWhole of western Singapore to become trial area for autonomous vehicles\n\nSingapore ranks 21 of 30 nations in soft power list, No. 1 in Enterprise", "description": "SINGAPORE \u2014 A man who masturbated and urinated into female residents\u2019 shoes at HDB blocks was on Thursday (24 October) fined $5,000 at the State Courts.", "authors": ["Amir Hussain", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Xp02jMZvCGdA7N4LlfB6zQ--~B/aD04NzUxO3c9OTExMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/7963dbe0-f643-11e9-bdff-b5028f63f263", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
