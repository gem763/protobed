This was not the subject of our conversation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur calls had nothing to do with weapons or the story with Burisma,\u201d he added, referring to the gas company where Mr Biden's son Hunter sat on the board. He said the Ukrainian stenogramme of the conversation matched the English one.\n\nAt the same time, Mr Zelenskiy said Ukraine was open to doing a joint investigation into the situation with the United States.\n\n\u201cPlease connect your general prosecutor with ours,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only on Burisma and Biden. We have many criminal cases to look at.\u201d", "description": "Ukraine's president has denied that Donald Trump tried to \u201cblackmail\u201d him into starting an investigation linked to candidate Joe Biden, but said he would help the United States if it opened its own investigation.", "authors": ["Alec Luhn", "Jemima Lewis", "David Green", "Matthew Lesh", "Stewart Jackson", "Vernon Bogdanor", "Michael Deacon"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000212584094-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqKU-op6n8Xxa2ymKjnWOvoQBL4iPaysraAy7B085YJhk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
