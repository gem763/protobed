Right as her popularity in the Democratic presidential contest is rising, the race has taken a dramatic turn: Her main rival for the nomination is under attack by the president.\n\nShe has been left with a choice: forcefully defend former Vice President Joe Biden against President Donald Trump\u2019s debunked accusations of misconduct in Ukraine by his son Hunter, or risk looking like she\u2019s taking advantage of Trump\u2019s attack on her top opponent to boost her own presidential campaign.\n\nWarren, so far, has kept her attention primarily on the need for impeaching the president, which she has championed for five months and which House Democrats are now embracing in droves. And Democratic operatives caution that she should continue spending her time focusing on the Trump and not her primary rival.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about Joe Biden. This is about Donald Trump,\u201d Rebecca Katz, a progressive Democratic strategist told The Daily Beast when asked how Warren\u2019s campaign should address the issue. \u201cOn the defining issue of the Trump era, Warren has been right since day one.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, she should pat herself on the back and remind everybody she called for impeachment before everyone else,\u201d Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh, who has long praised Warren\u2019s presidential candidacy, said. \u201cJoe Biden honestly has nothing to do with this.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s handling of the Trump-Ukraine saga illustrates the tricky politics that many Democrats currently find themselves in, including Biden\u2019s own campaign. Few Democrats are eager to elevate Trump\u2019s attacks on the former vice president by engaging them head on. But virtually no one in the party feels comfortable letting them go unanswered. The question is how to do so.\n\nIn interviews with multiple progressive Democrats and Warren supporters, their chief advice to Warren is don\u2019t rush to Biden\u2019s defense against Trump, but don\u2019t jab him over being slower to call for impeachment inquires, either.\n\n\u201cThere will be plenty of time for real policy differences with Joe Biden, but the biggest Trump corruption scandal of his presidency is not the time to do it,\u201d said Adam Green, cofounder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a Washington-based organization that has endorsed Warren\u2019s presidential bid. \u201cWe need 100 percent all hands on deck calling for impeachment right now.\u201d\n\nThe comments come as more than 160 House Democrats are now calling for some degree of impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI called for impeachment five months ago, the day after the Mueller Report came out,\u201d Warren wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, without addressing Biden. \u201cTrump continues to commit crimes because he believes he\u2019s above the law. If Congress does nothing to respond, he\u2019ll be right,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe must begin impeachment proceedings\u2014now.\u201d\n\nBiden has been noticeably slower than his Democratic opponents on the issue that has reached a new height this week. On Tuesday afternoon, he took a stronger stance than in the past when addressing how House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should move forward.\n\n\u201cUsing its full constitutional authority, Congress, in my view, should demand the information it has a legal right to receive,\u201d Biden said from Delaware. If the president refuses to cooperate, Biden added, \u201cTrump will leave Congress, in my view, with no choice but impeachment. That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s new stance\u2014and Warren\u2019s doubling down\u2014comes as a pair of early state polls released in recent days from Iowa and New Hampshire show Warren narrowly beat out Biden for the number one spot in the respective states.\n\n\u201cVoters respond to moral clarity and courage, and Senator Warren showed it in spades with her early call for impeaching Donald Trump,\u201d Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, which recently endorsed Warren, told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cIt's great to see others in the field follow her lead,\u201d he said, without referencing Biden.\n\nWarren's campaign declined to comment.\n\nOne Democratic communications operative supportive of Warren stressed that the best course of action is to focus on her own campaign and not address Biden by name.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not facing pressure from voters on this, so she should continue her focus on how she\u2019ll root out corruption to make real change in people\u2019s lives,\u201d the operative said. \u201cIf she\u2019s going to weigh in, she should condemn the media\u2019s willingness to blur the lines.\u201d\n\nIn late April, Warren was the first major Democratic presidential candidate to call on the House to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump. Her call came immediately after the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Trump and Russia.\n\n\u201cThe severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty,\u201d she wrote on Twitter at the time. \u201cThat means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States.\u201d\n\nSince then, Warren has grown increasingly fervent in pushing the issue.\n\nIn her most recent public showing during a Democratic cattle call in Iowa, Warren started off her speech amplifying her previous sentiments, while saying she\u2019s there \u201cto stand up for the Constitution\u201d and that \u201cCongress failed to act\u201d in impeaching Trump, impressing voters in the influential caucus state.\n\n\u201cShe read the report. She didn\u2019t do any poll testing about how this is going to look. She looked at the facts and decided to do what\u2019s right. Voters are hungry for a leader who has the courage of their convictions,\u201d Katz said.\n\nSo far, there\u2019s been considerable upside for Warren. Multiple polls showed her popularity increasing after she called for impeachment in the spring. And the number of small-dollar donations grew. Additionally, Warren\u2019s campaign brought in more than $19.1 million in the second quarter of the year, more than tripling her total for the first quarter.\n\n\u201cYou keep it about the facts,\u201d Katz added. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about whether or not to defend a rival. This is about the rule of law.\u201d", "description": "She was the first to call for impeachment.
