For a start the UK and the Irish Republic have different VAT rates and, after we leave the EU, will charge different tariffs on goods.\n\nA system will have to be put in place to tax goods exported from Britain to Eire via Northern Ireland.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s plan is also a much harder Brexit than Theresa May \u2019s.\n\nGDP per capita would fall by up to 7% in 10 years, says the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. There is no guarantee on workers\u2019 rights or environmental safeguards.\n\nCan he get it through the Commons?\n\nThe numbers are tight. He needs the support of all 288 Conservative MPs, the 21 Tory MPs who\u2019ve lost the Whip, all 10 DUP MPs and at least one Labour or independent. That takes him to the magic 320 needed for a majority.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nDoes this mean Brexit is sorted by October 31?\n\nFar fro, it. The UK and EU parliaments must approve a deal.\n\nOpposition MPs in the Commons will try to amend the legislation, with the Lib Dems saying they will push for a second referendum.\n\nIf a deal is passed the UK still has to hammer out a trade deal with the EU which will be more tortuous.\n\nWe have to strike agreements with the EU on intelligence sharing, security and data transfers, and agree dozens of trade deals with countries such as the US and China.", "description": "Boris Johnson intends to scrap the Irish backstop but his Brexit plans have hit major stumbling blocks", "authors": ["Jason Beattie", "Image", "Getty Images", "Dinendra Haria Lnp", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637579.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_PM-Johnson-Meet-Mental-Health-Campaigner-Ben-West-Outside-10-Downing-Street.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
