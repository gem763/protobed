But its decision earlier this month to invoke emergency laws banning face masks sparked fears about the use of advanced surveillance to target demonstrators.\n\niOmniscient's technology conformed to the European Union's data protection standards, which meant that clients usually could not access the faces stored in their own system. But in the case of an emergency such as a missing child, the client could reverse the redaction for selected individuals.\n\nUniversity of Queensland professor Brian Lovell, an expert in facial recognition who sold some of his technology to iOmniscient in 2011 but has no relationship with the company, said it was not unusual that a software developer would be unable to monitor the use of their product after the point of sale.\n\n\"You\u2019d be pretty annoyed if Bill Gates can read all your Word documents,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Lovell acknowledged, however, that advances in convolutional neural networks (a form of artificial intelligence) had led to vast improvements in facial recognition, and that companies needed to take precautions such as limiting the number of cameras linked to their software.\n\nHe also noted that traditional weapons systems such as those for missiles tended to have a \"kill switch\" that enabled manufacturers to shut down their products in emergency situations, but this was uncommon for software and its introduction would likely be met with legal challenges.\n\nDr Kanga said his business was \"politically neutral\" but drew some moral lines. Omniscient had not sold facial recognition technology to clients in mainland China, and would not do business with regimes such as those in North Korea or Iran.\n\nAsked about the unrest in Hong Kong, he was diplomatic: \"I would hope that in the long term [China] can maintain the 'one China, two systems' policy, which I think is Hong Kong's strength.\"", "description": "iOmniscient chief executive Rustom Kanga says his company does not know whether or how its technology is being used  in Hong Kong.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b071bb5362e17882ade6acb9a83612081efe9081", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
