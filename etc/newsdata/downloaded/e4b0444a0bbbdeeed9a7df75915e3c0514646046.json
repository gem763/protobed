The count of 360 is probably an underestimate and does not fully convey the severity of the problem. Incidents reported to state and local authorities are not included in the tally.\n\nAD\n\nMore troubling, employees told GAO they don\u2019t always report threats, because they are \u201cpart of the job,\u201d or a \u201ccommon occurrence\u201d even while off-duty, shopping or at home. Many cases were motivated by \u201canti-government ideologies,\u201d according to GAO.\n\nAD\n\nDespite this, none of the four agencies \u2014 the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service \u2014 have completed all required facility security assessments, and three have no plans to do so. The House Natural Resources oversight and investigations subcommittee will discuss the report at a hearing Tuesday on \u201cProtecting Federal Employees and Ending the Culture of Anti-Government Attacks and Abuse.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump demonstrated his position last year on those anti-government ideologues who violate federal facilities, and it is not a comforting one for feds.\n\nAD\n\nHe pardoned two men whose convictions on public-land arson charges helped ignite the six-week Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation in Oregon in 2016. He absolved Dwight Hammond Jr. and Steven Hammond, father-and-son cattle ranchers in southeastern Oregon whose convictions carried mandatory five-year sentences. After a judge gave them much less time, prosecutors appealed, and they were resentenced to the five years.\n\nAD\n\nTheir return to prison incensed supporters, including the Malheur occupiers who \u201cdirectly tied their actions to the Hammonds\u2019 case and the broader frustration over federal land control,\u201d The Washington Post reported last year.\n\nMalheur was repeatedly mentioned in the report, which cited examples of threatening incidents around the time of the occupation, including:\n\nAD\n\n\u25cf\u201cIndividuals holding anti-government beliefs [who] followed a teenage girl wearing a BLM shirt around the local grocery store and threatened to burn her house down.\u201d\n\n\u25cfPeople regularly parking outside employees\u2019 houses, making one official feel \u201cthey were holding us hostage in our own homes.\u201d\n\n\u25cfReports of shots being fired over employees\u2019 heads while they worked in the field.\n\nBecause of incidents such as these, GAO said that \u201cmany employees were traumatized by the Malheur occupation and some did not return to work\u201d there.\n\nAD\n\nAmong the 88 BLM cases cited was the attempted murder of a law enforcement officer and the stabbing of an employee outside a federal building. The FBI investigated the posting of a BLM officer\u2019s personal information on Twitter and the more than 500 harassing phone calls and several death threats that followed.\n\nAD\n\nSteve Ellis, a 38-year federal employee, said in an interview that he was threatened several times before he retired in 2016 as BLM\u2019s deputy director, the agency\u2019s highest career position. In one 2007 Enterprise, Ore., incident, two men upset over proposed federal limits on the use of all-terrain vehicles in Wallowa-Whitman National Forest threatened to lynch him, he said.\n\nFive years later, a Nevada county commissioner ran up to him, nose-to-nose, like a baseball manager furious over an umpire\u2019s call, he said. The local official was angry because he believed Ellis\u2019s decision not to proceed with a wind-farm project would hurt the region\u2019s employment. \u201cYou better not ever show your face in Elko County,\u201d Ellis recalled the commissioner yelling.\n\nAD\n\nAs a manager, Ellis had to spend more on protection for security cameras, higher office counters so people could not jump over them as one upset man did, panic buttons on lanyards for employees to use when threatened and distress signals for staffers in the field.\n\nAD\n\nThe Interior Department, which includes the BLM, Fish and Wildlife and the Park Service, and the Agriculture Department, which includes the Forest Service, generally agreed with GAO recommendations to complete facility security assessments.\n\nFish and Wildlife has a plan to do so, but the other three agencies don\u2019t, according to GAO. Officials at the three agencies blamed limited resources, poor training and decentralized organization structures for the job not getting done.\n\n\u201cOur highest priority is the safety and well being of our employees and visitors on our public lands,\u201d an Interior Department statement said. \u201cWe are committed to continuing to improve our facilities and operations to ensure a safe and secure environment is established department-wide.\u201d The Agriculture Department did not have further comment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnti-government extremists target employees of these agencies because the staffers often are the most visible government workers, particularly in rural areas of 12 western states where about one-third of all land in the United States is federally owned.\n\n\u201cBLM employees have had to deal with an ever-increasing number of threats from radicalized elements of the public,\u201d said Andrew Suppiger, a National Federation of Federal Employees local president in California. \u201cWhat guidance have we given to our employees who are likely to come into contact with the public outside of the office in addressing these threats? None as far as I am aware.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The range of intimidation included attempted murder.
