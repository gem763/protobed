(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nMedia critic\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson last week got some attention when he and Neil Patel wrote a Daily Caller op-ed criticizing President Trump for having pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. \u201cSome Republicans are trying, but there\u2019s no way to spin this as a good idea. Like a lot of things Trump does, it was pretty over-the-top.\u201d\n\nOn his Fox News program Wednesday night, Carlson followed up those sentiments with these sentiments: \u201cThe president has already asked half-facetiously Ukraine and China to look into the Bidens, maybe he should check with the Kazakhs, too. You might find something,\u201d he said.\n\nThe advice on Kazakhstan was based on Carlson\u2019s contention that, according to court filings reviewed by \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, had dealings in Kazakhstan through the same business partner \u2014 Devon Archer \u2014 who\u2019s involved in the controversy surrounding Ukraine. \u201cArcher and Hunter Biden have a business relationship that centers on more than simply Ukraine. They also did business together in China. And according to court filings reviewed by this show, Archer and Biden\u2019s firm, Rosemont Seneca, also did business with Kazakhstan\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund.\u201d\n\nAs for the claim that Trump \u201chalf-facetiously\u201d petitioned Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens, that\u2019s a recycled talking point that Republican apologists for Trump have floated on public-affairs shows. The main problem with the talking point is the not-at-all-joking demeanor of the president in remarks last Thursday: \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\" said the president. He also repeatedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden in a July 25 call, an incident that\u2019s fueling an impeachment inquiry.\n\nSmirking is a big part of the show here. As Carlson was advising Trump to \u201ccheck with the Kazakhs,\u201d a couple of satirical creases emerged on his face. Which is to say, the host was happy to excuse and joke about an abuse of power in front of the Fox News audience, whereas he criticized that same abuse in sober terms for his Daily Caller audience.\n\nNone of this would merit several hundred words if Carlson were a mere cable-news host. He\u2019s much more than that, however: He\u2019s also a presidential counselor, as evidenced by his impact on Trump\u2019s decisions regarding Iran and South Africa.\n\nWhat a great world it is for Carlson. He makes millions; he\u2019s wildly influential; and his employer apparently cares not a whit that he misleads viewers about his own convictions, to the extent they exist.\n\nRead more from Erik Wemple:\n\nTucker Carlson\u2019s very own Ukraine scandal\n\nFox News: Ukrainian president seems cool with the Trump-Biden thing!\n\nHannity: The \u2018media mob\u2019 is corrupt.
