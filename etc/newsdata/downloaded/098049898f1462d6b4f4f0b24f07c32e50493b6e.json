Barnett\u2019s Buried Alive Project and MiAngel Cody\u2019s The Decarceration Collective. The initiative seeks to support incarcerated men and women who are serving life sentences as a result of various state and federal tough-on-crime bills passed decades ago.\n\nThis is way more than a song, it\u2019s a movement! We are doing everything in our power to bring home men and women trapped behind the wall due to an outdated 3 strikes drug law.

It also hopes to help them reenter society and get them \u201cbasic essentials to step back into the world,\u201d he said. The federal three strikes rule was part of the now-controversial 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. Initially written by then-Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, it was created to address a rise in violent crimes.\n\nIn part, the law helped pay for new federal prisons if states agreed to force offenders to serve 85% of their sentence, as opposed to allowing them out early on parole.\n\nAmid more recent calls for criminal justice reform, politicians, including Biden, have come under fire for their roles in passing tough-on-crime legislation.\n\n\"This is ruining the family structure,\u201d Pusha T said, calling that breakdown \u201ca domino effect.\u201d\n\n\"Everyone involved in making those laws and passing those laws has damn near expressed regret and wrongdoing\u2026how could we not go back and at least fix everything?\" he added.\n\nThe U.S. \u201cwar on drugs\u201d in the \u201880s and \u201890s also resulted in mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses that sometimes resulted in life sentences for first-time offenders.\n\nOne of those offenders was Tony Lewis Sr., who has been serving a sentence of life without parole in a Maryland federal prison since 1989 for his involvement in a Washington, D.C., drug ring in the '80s. Lewis was 26 at the time of his sentencing, and is now 56 years old.\n\n\"Before Obama, we had Eric B. or Tony Lewis out in D.C. The 80's kingpins, gotta free them. All these faces, they ain't believe in. If no child's left, then how can we leave them?\u201d Pusha T raps in \u201cComing Home.\u201d\n\nThe rapper met Lewis Sr.'s son, Tony Lewis Jr., a Washington, D.C., activist and re-entry expert for people getting out of prison, at a concert a few years ago. The younger Lewis, who is now 39, was only 9 years old when his father went to prison, and told ABC News that his life sentence \u201cset forth a series of events where my mother started to battle severe mental illness and economically our situation changed.\n\n\"The trauma and the stress and living in a community where drugs and violence are prevalent -- I was able to navigate through that but many of my peers were not,\u201d he said.\n\nPusha T built a partnership with Lewis Jr. and got him involved with his work with My Brother's Keeper -- an initiative launched by President Obama in 2012 to address the opportunity gap for young men of color.\n\nThe rapper said that Lewis' story, which is documented in his book \u201cSlugg: A Boy's Life in the Age of Mass Incarceration,\u201d was \u201calways extremely special to me\u201d and one of the inspirations behind \"Coming Home.\u201d\n\n\"We never speak in terms of fathers, grandfathers, grandmothers, mothers,\" the rapper said. \"We never speak in a family sense and I think everyone seems more focused on stats and numbers. If people just thought about it and spoke about it more in a family sense maybe the sensitivity and the compassion would come back to the issue.\"\n\nLewis Jr., who had no idea that his father would be mentioned in Pusha T\u2019s song, told ABC News that hearing it for the first time \"brought tears to my eyes.\"\n\nDavid Crotty/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images, FILE\n\nAlthough his father has not had the chance to listen to it yet, Lewis said that he sent him the lyrics and he was \"completely blown away. He was floored.\"\n\nLegendary singer and rapper Lauryn Hill, who had not released new music or granted a collaboration in years, agreed to be featured on the track, a surreal feeling for both Lewis and Pusha T.\n\n\"It was a milestone in my career to have a record with [Lauryn Hill], and that\u2019s just it,\" he said. \"It wasn\u2019t even on my bucket list because it was such a dream.\"", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/pusha-t-file-gty-jef-190904_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
