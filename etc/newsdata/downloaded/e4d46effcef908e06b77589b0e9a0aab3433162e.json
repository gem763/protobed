(File photo: Steve Marcus/Reuters)\n\nIn his new book on the Harvey Weinstein sexual-assault scandal, journalist Ronan Farrow has revealed that Hillary Clinton\u2019s publicist, Nick Merrill, contacted him and attempted to pressure him into dropping the Weinstein story, at what he apparently alleges was Weinstein\u2019s behest.\n\nFarrow writes in the book that he received a call from Merrill, who told him that the Weinstein story he was working on was \u201ca concern for\u201d Clinton, according to the Hollywood Reporter. He goes on to reveal that Weinstein proposed making a documentary series on Clinton to NBC, Farrow\u2019s employer.\n\nMerrill, for his part, denied that he or the Clinton campaign had felt any pressure from Weinstein in a response to the new revelations posted on Twitter.\n\nI genuinely respect Ronan\u2019s work, but have no idea what Weinstein was saying to people to save himself. What I do know is simple: I\u2019d already rejected a Weinstein Co proposed doc about the election before talking to Ronan. If HW misrepresented facts, it wouldn\u2019t be the 1st time. https://t.co/SAI4yieHxZ \u2014 Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) October 9, 2019\n\nWeinstein is set to face trial on rape charges in New York City in January, after trying and failing to have the case moved to New Jersey.", "description": "In his new book on the Harvey Weinstein sexual-assault scandal, journalist Ronan Farrow has revealed that Hillary Clinton's publicist, Nick Merrill, contacted him and attempted to pressure him into dropping the Weinstein story, at what he apparently alleges was Weinstein's behest.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Rich Lowry", "Kevin D.
