Andy Kim (D-NJ), a freshman Democrat representing a New Jersey swing district, said Saturday that Democrats cannot \u201coverlook\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cabuse of power.\u201d\n\nRep. Kim hosted a town hall in Westhampton, New Jersey, speaking on a range of topics including President Trump\u2019s Syria and Afghanistan strategy, as well as his support for impeaching President Trump.\n\nRep. Kim, who had initially resisted calls for him to back impeachment, joined the large swathe of Democrats now seeking to oust President Trump.\n\nDuring the town hall, one Burlington County, New Jersey asked the freshman Democrat why Americans should not wait and let people decide whether to oust the president through the ballot box.\n\nThe New Jersey resident asked, \u201cThere\u2019s only one year until the election, why not let the people decide at the polls instead of going down this partisan road?\u201d\n\nRep. Kim said that Democrats can no longer ignore the president\u2019s alleged abuse of power.\n\nKim said:\n\nWe can\u2019t overlook what has actually happened in terms of the president\u2019s abuse of power. I just want us as a room and as a country to reflect upon what we think we want to see from a commander in chief and what responsibilities they have to us. And see if we have at least some agreement upon whether or not we think a commander in chief should be engaging with a foreign country about personal gain.\n\nCongressman Kim represents one of the many districts that President Trump won by more than six points during the 2016 presidential election and that Republicans hope to flip during the 2020 election cycle.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 drive to impeach President Trump has become increasingly fervent.\n\nRep. Max Rose (D-NY), another freshman Democrat representing Staten Island and Brooklyn, New York, said Friday, in a twisted sense of the American justice system, President Trump must \u201cprove\u201d he is \u201cinnocent\u201d on impeachment.\n\n\u201cI do not want to be here. This is the last thing I want to be doing,\u201d Rose said. \u201cBut no one is to blame but the president. The president says he is innocent, so all we are saying is \u2018prove it.\u2019 But that is not what they are doing. They are not cooperating, and we need to get to the bottom of it.\u201d", "description": "Andy Kim, a Democrat representing a New Jersey swing district, said Saturday that Democrats cannot \"overlook\" Trump's \"abuse of power.\"", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Andy-Kim-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
