I hate to lose. But I also know what I can do when I play\u2026\n\n\u201cSometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Even though I lost, I can take it as an experience.\u201d\n\nChardy, roared on by the home crowd in the French capital, saved nine break points in a dramatic deciding set.\n\n\u201cJeremy played very well, but it\u2019s a shame because I had my chances,\u201d added Medvedev, who is the only current player other than the \u2018big four\u2019 of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray to have made six consecutive ATP finals.\n\n\u201cThe difference was that he was able to take the opportunities that came his way and I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMedvedev\u2019s run of finals dated back to July, during which he had claimed the Cincinnati and Shanghai Masters titles and lost an epic US Open championship match to Rafael Nadal.\n\nIn New York, he was the first Russian man to reach a Grand Slam final since Marat Safin at the 2005 Australian Open and he has won four ATP tournaments in 2019 in total.\n\nMedvedev will next head to London for his maiden appearance at the ATP Tour Finals next month, where he is hoping to emulate last year\u2019s champion and fellow youngster Alexander Zverev.\n\n\u201cNow I have more time to prepare for the Tour Finals. It really is a dream for me to be going there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tournament where anything can happen, Zverev showed that there last year. It\u2019s going to be a good experience.\u201d\n\nIt is the first time that Chardy has reached the third round at Bercy, having already come through two matches of qualifying and a first-round tie with Sam Querrey.\n\n\u201cTo win against a guy like him (Medvedev) is a great feeling,\u201d said the 32-year-old. \u201cAt the end there everything was shaking, but I had nothing to lose.\u201d\n\nChardy will next play a last-16 clash against either 15th seed John Isner or Chile\u2019s Cristian Garin.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Daniil Medvedev said that he \u201chates losing\u201d after suffering a shock second-round defeat by French world number 65 Jeremy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/e9f1b7_medvedev-saw-his-run-six-consecutive-finals-an-end-hate-losing-medvedev-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
