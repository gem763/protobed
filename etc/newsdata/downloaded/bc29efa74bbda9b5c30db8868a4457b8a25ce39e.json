He is flamboyant or whatever, that\u2019s his character, but I think he has the strongest potential to be able to get us to leave\u2019\n\nWorkington has suffered from rising unemployment and levels of deprivation (Picture: PA)\n\nHowever, he said whichever party delivers the strongest promise to protect the NHS will be key to winning his vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll parties will be looking to gain voters from their oppositions while maintaining holds on their existing constituencies at the general election.\n\nThe use of voter stereotypes as a targeting tactic dates back to at least Margaret Thatcher\u2019s repeated electoral wins in the 1980s where the working-class \u2018Essex man\u2019 switched allegiance from Labour to the Tories.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
