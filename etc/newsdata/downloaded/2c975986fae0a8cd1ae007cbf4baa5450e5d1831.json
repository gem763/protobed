I was with my mate and this guy just came up to me and told me to empty my pockets.\n\n\"I said something like 'what you on about' and he squared up to me and punched me a few times and dropped to the floor.\n\n\"He then started kicking me on the floor and had my iPhone hidden to the floor and he got my wallet out of my pocket.\n\n\"He nicked my bank card and took \u00a3350. I thought if he took my bank card then I could cancel it quick, but he'd already withdrawn the money.\"\n\nThe man did not manage to steal Reegan's mobile phone, however, the attacker grabbed a mobile phone out of the hand of his friend and also ran off with it.\n\nNursing his cut face, swollen nose, split lip and chipped teeth, Reegan is now on the mend but says he has been left \"paranoid\" to leave his home.\n\nReegan, who lives in Anlaby Common, said: \"I went into a ball to just protect my phone. I just don't want it to happen to someone my own age, so I want to get this out there that there are people like this around.\"\n\nSpeaking about what affect the attack has had on the teenager, he added: \"I don't really want to go outside at the moment, I'm not scared, but I'm quite paranoid.\n\n\"Go in groups and look after yourself, especially if you've had a drink. When I was down, I was lying on my phone to protect it.\"\n\nHe added: \"All I was doing was minding my own business walking through the city. My injuries are nothing massive, but my lip is bust and I've chipped a few teeth too.\n\n\"My nose is also really swollen, but not broken. I have a two black eyes too which isn't good.\"\n\nReegan describes his attacker as around 5ft 10ins, of mixed race ethnicity and was wearing a black tracksuit with his hood up.\n\nHumberside Police said that they are investigating the assault.\n\nA spokeswoman for the force said: \"We are investigating an assault which was reported to us at 9.40pm on Monday, October 28.\n\n\"Two young people, a man aged 19 and a woman aged 18, reported they had been approached by a man near Liddell Street Park in Hull city centre.\n\n\"It has been reported to us that the man demanded their mobile phones and bank cards. The 19 year-old man refused to hand over his property and was struck in the face sustaining cuts and bruising which needed hospital treatment.", "description": "Reegan Fell, 19, was punched in the face for his wallet in Hull city centre but was able to keep ahold of his iPhone", "authors": ["Tom Kershaw"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20754604.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Reegan-Fell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
