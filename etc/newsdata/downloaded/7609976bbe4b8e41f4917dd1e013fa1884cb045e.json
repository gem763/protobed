Han, the mayor of the port city of Kaohsiung, is trailing Tsai in the polls.\n\nIn a video message posted on Facebook on Tuesday, Gou blamed personal and factional interests for dividing society.\n\n\"I am not willing to participate and cannot bear seeing my supporters being bullied,\" he said.", "description": "Former Foxconn CEO Terry Gou has given up on making an independent bid for Taiwan's presidency, citing an \"abominable election atmosphere\" and bullying of his supporters.
