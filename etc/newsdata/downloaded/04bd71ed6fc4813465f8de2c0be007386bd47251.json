Or the start of the beginning. Or something like that anyway. The last week in October will see English cricket\u2019s inaugural draft, a first bolt of lightning shot through the Hundred\u2019s shell-company teams. Unbidden, unprecedented, not to mention rootless and entirely commercial in nature; the franchises are coming. Not that this is completely new. Look hard enough and they\u2019re already here.\n\nRewind to early August and down a winding lane, through a patch of woodland, in the middle of a new-build timber hanger a few miles off the A3, Jaydev Unadkat is trying to teach a nervous-looking 13-year-old left-arm seamer how to stop dragging his line down outside leg-stump by lifting his front arm a little higher.\n\nThe unforgettable summer: reporting on the 2019 cricket season Read more\n\n\u201cThe front arm is your radar,\u201d Unadkat says, urging his charge to try it right now in front of 30 or so academy mates, plus assembled coaches, camera crew and the watching throng on the balcony.\n\nThe nervous-looking seamer bites his lip, runs in, elevates his front arm and pings off stump out of its slot with a satisfying clank, just about concealing the flush of delighted relief as he strolls down to retrieve his ball.\n\nThe coaches nod. Training ticks on. Unadkat, who has played Test cricket for India and was the most expensive Indian player at last year\u2019s Indian Premier League auction, attends to some other pace bowling detail. And the only really puzzling thing about any of this is the fact everyone present is wearing the bright pink shirt of the Rajasthan Royals of Jaipur.\n\nThe Royals have always positioned themselves as a hub for English IPL interests. From the start this most moneyball-ish of franchises has had a sprinkling of English players, from early Shane Warne-sourced adoptees Dimitri Mascherenas and Michael Lumb to the current A-list tier of Ben Stokes, Jofra Archer and Jos Buttler.\n\nThe academy is something new. The following weekend these junior Royals will play Hampshire Under-15s at the Ageas Bowl, part of an ever-thickening round of county and touring fixtures. Even Unadkat is here on serious business, a training trip that will see him work with the bowling fitness guru and Royals consultant Steffan Jones.\n\nThe part-owner Manoj Badale is agreeably open about all this. The goal of the Royals in England isn\u2019t just to build the brand (as ever those outside English sport\u2019s traditions speak with genuine pride about their sporting brands). It is to create a concrete cricketing presence, to foster the dream of a direct pathway from English grassroots to cricket\u2019s most glam-laden stage.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019d love to see that happen,\u201d Badale says. \u201cWe will also be happy if the academy continues to launch players in the county circuit, who then become England stars of the future.\u201d\n\nSounds fanciful? A few weeks after the Hampshire game Sid Lahiri, the mercurial head of the Royals\u2019 UK academy, is still talking about a shot played by one hugely talented 13- year-old in Royals colours \u2013 a ramp-swept one-bounce four off an opening bowler \u2013 that seems to suggest the sky might indeed be the limit.\n\n\u201cA hundred per cent it is the ultimate dream to go and play for Rajasthan Royals,\u201d Lahiri says. \u201cI am sure that will happen. The talent pool is there. If you look at the English kids we are coaching I would be surprised if we don\u2019t see at least one of them in the Rajasthan Royals colours in a few years.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shane Warne oversees a net session in Cobham. Photograph: Luke Walker/Getty Images for Rajasthan Royals\n\nLahiri is a fascinating figure in his own right. He came to England in 2003 to take his coaching badges at the end of some slightly frustrating travels around the domestic scene in India. \u201cI knew nobody, had no clue, nobody knew who I was. I started with one boy. I had nothing. Just us at the park.\u201d\n\nEventually his time playing at Stoke D\u2019Abernon, teaching cricket at Parkside school, and a generous cash gift from one very grateful and very wealthy parent \u2013 Lahiri bought four bowling machines with the money \u2013 led to the creation of Star Cricket Academy.\n\nAt which point a bloom of young Surrey talent rolled in through the door. Lahiri coached Ollie Pope from the age of seven (\u201ceven then his ability to learn was mind-blowing\u201d) as well as Ryan Patel, Amir Virdi and others. In 2019 his set-up at Reeds School was rolled up into Rajasthan Royals\u2019 UK academy, a tie-in that has its roots in Lahiri\u2019s long-standing relationship with Rubin Bharucha, now the Royals\u2019 head of cricket.\n\nWas this cricket's best summer ever? \u2013 The Spin Podcast Read more\n\nIf there is still an air of double-take about all this, a sense of a punt, an entrepreneurial gamble, it is worth remembering the IPL is in itself a punt, albeit one that has from a standing start become the ninth most watched league in world sport. Why have the Rajasthan Royals opened an academy in England? For the same reason Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United have academies in every major sporting nation in the world, outriders of football\u2019s steamrollering cultural ascent.\n\nAs Badale says, \u201cWe were attracted to the UK as a market due to our existing fanbase here, our three English stars [Ben, Jofra and Jos] and the fact we have a deep network in this country.\u201d There will be a temptation to shrug at this, to tut at the suggestion the Royals might make a dent in English cricket culture.\n\nBut then English cricket has a history of missing the top line with India, Twenty20 and shifting tectonic plates. Like it or not the IPL is an expansionist force. It has to grow, has to stretch its tentacles. The franchise system offers this. A franchise, unlike a country, can be marketed and finessed as a brand, ranked on a scale of nought to Real Madrid or the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nThere has already been talk of IPL franchises expanding via merger and acquisitions into the leagues of other countries. The Rajasthan Royals enter the Hundred: it won\u2019t happen in any version of the future that doesn\u2019t involve the cricketing public marching on ECB HQ brandishing pitchforks and lighted torches.\n\nFor now the IPL will content itself with talk of fan parks, with an expansionist broadcast strategy (up significantly in the UK in the last two years) and with its seed planted in deepest Surrey.\n\nSomething will grow here. It might be a tranche of fast-tracked English-born IPL players. Or simply a sense that the wild, aggressively entrepreneurial spirit of big sport, with all its collateral damage and brutal modernity, might just be the way to grow this cobwebbed old summer game in whatever direction it can find.\n\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n\n\u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.
