Club Brugge\n\nMignolet rotated between being Liverpool's No.1 and sitting on the bench for a few seasons before Loris Karius became Klopp's favoured option between the sticks.\n\n(Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\nBut Karius would go on to drop two clangers in the Champions League final, prompting Klopp to splash the cash on Alisson.\n\nMignolet, realising first team opportunities were now impossible to come by, eventually moved back to Belgium.\n\nNathaniel Clyne\n\nWhere is he now? Liverpool\n\nThe right-back looked certain to run Liverpool's line for years to come after joining from Southampton, but has suffered countless injuries at Anfield.\n\nThis, coupled with the emergence of Trent Alexander-Arnold, saw Clyne disappear from everyone's minds, but he enjoyed some football on loan at Bournemouth last season.\n\nAlberto Moreno\n\nWhere is he now? Villarreal\n\nThe Spaniard never showed consistency during his time on Merseyside; sometimes performing well, other times dropping clangers.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nGoing forward Moreno often looked dangerous, but it was when tracking back that the left-back let himself and his team-mates down.\n\nEventually Klopp opted to sign some competition for Moreno in the form of Andy Robertson, and well, the rest is history.\n\nMamadou Sakho\n\nWhere is he now? Crystal Palace\n\nAnother inconsistent performer on Merseyside, Sakho sometimes looked assured and assertive at the back, other times he looked nervous on the ball and was prone to a clanger or two.\n\nKlopp would often rotate the centre-back and never seemed truly convinced by him.\n\nEventually the Frenchman was sent out on loan to Crystal Palace, and impressed for the south London club. So much so in fact that Palace went on to sign him permanently in a deal worth \u00a326million.\n\nEmre Can\n\nWhere is he now? Juventus\n\nIt's unclear why the German was so keen to leave Liverpool as it always appeared that Klopp was a fan of his compatriot.\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\nBut for whatever reason Can let his contract run down at Anfield and joined Juventus on a free in the summer of 2018.\n\nThings haven't gone to plan for the midfielder though, with Can falling down the pecking order in Turin and even being left out of the club's Champions League squad this season.\n\nLucas Leiva\n\nWhere is he now? Lazio\n\nLucas was neither forced out for not being good enough nor moved on because he didn't want to be at Liverpool anymore.\n\nHe'd simply done his time on Merseyside after 10 years and went to Italy to try something new with Lazio before retirement.\n\nJames Milner\n\nWhere is he now? Liverpool\n\nMany would have assumed Milner was on his way out when Klopp took the reins.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe midfielder was pushing 30 and was used to fill the gaps at Liverpool as opposed to win games for the Reds.\n\nBut no one told Klopp he'd need a shotgun to get rid of Milner and four years on he's won a Champions League with the Reds and is still in the team. Incredible.\n\nKolo Toure\n\nWhere is he now? Retired\n\nThe Arsenal Invincible spent three seasons at Liverpool from 2013 to 2016 before moving to Celtic for a single campaign.\n\nToure signed on a free transfer and provided some important cover for the Reds.\n\nBut given his ages, and the fact he was signed as experienced cover rather than a long-term centre-back, he was eventually released.\n\nJordan Henderson\n\nWhere is he now? Liverpool\n\nHenderson joined the Reds from Sunderland in 2011, four seasons before Klopp took the reins from Brendan Rodgers.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nOver the years he's been tipped to follow in the footsteps of David Beckham and also criticised for not becoming David Beckham.\n\nDespite the ups and downs, praise and criticism, Henderson is Liverpool captain and skippered the side to Champions League glory last season.\n\nAdam Lallana\n\nWhere is he now? Liverpool\n\nInjuries have plagued Lallana's time at Liverpool, which has seen him play very little football over the past few years.\n\nKlopp has always appeared to be a big fan of the former Southampton man, who offers some creativity in the middle of the park - something Liverpool lack at times.\n\nBut Lallana is 31 now and perhaps running out of time at Liverpool.\n\nRoberto Firmino\n\nWhere is he now? Liverpool\n\nThe biggest success story of the team from 2016.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIt's crazy to think that it was Rodgers who signed the Brazilian, given the fact he is the epitome of a 'Klopp player' - the man who kick-stars the heavy mental gegenpress.\n\nFirmino is one of the first names on Klopp's Liverpool teamsheet in 2019 and a man he will be hoping can make the difference against United on Sunday.", "description": "Sunday's fixture at Old Trafford will be the tenth time Jurgen Klopp has faced Man United as Liverpool boss", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Getty Images", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Reuters", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637935.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-v-Arsenal-Premier-League-Anfield-13116.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
