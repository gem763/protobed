Based on that, we are trying to find an agreeable solution that can satisfy both sides.\"The official added that he plans to seek an early resolution with his Japanese counterpart.If, however, the talks do not go well, Seoul is expected to send a formal request to set up a dispute settlement body at the WTO to make a ruling on the matter.In July, Tokyo imposed export restrictions on South Korea on three high-tech materials, which are crucial for the production of semiconductors and displays.The South Korean government has been stressing that Japan's export curbs violate WTO rules and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.Kan Hyeong-woo, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
