He was decided that he would have been dismissed if still employed\n\nA 'predatory' police officer who starred in BBC documentary The Met: Policing London tried to seduce a vulnerable drug dealer after arresting her.\n\nPC Hitesh Patel, based at Stoke Newington Police Station, arrested the woman in August 2016 and obtained her telephone number after she returned to the police station to be charged the following month.\n\nHe repeatedly badgered the woman, contacting her 30 times until the end of February 2017 while he was both on and off duty.\n\nHis behaviour came to light after the woman approached police with allegations of inappropriate behaviour - including allegations he took her to lunch on the day of her sentencing hearing.\n\nShe also claimed that later that day he gave her a lift home and while there kissed her without consent.\n\nA year-long probe was launched into Patel \u2013 who served in one of the Metropolitan Police's gang units - by the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC).\n\nIOPC Regional Director Sal Naseem said Patel said his behaviour amounted to a 'terrible betrayal of his role' and branded his behaviour 'predatory'.\n\nHe said: 'PC Patel clearly and persistently abused his position in an attempt to pursue a relationship with a vulnerable woman.\n\n'Such was the effect on the woman PC Patel pursued that during the course of our thorough year-long investigation she was so fearful of reprisals that she did not feel able to provide a formal statement.'\n\nPatel previously appeared on a 2017 episode of The Met: Policing London. In the show, he spoke about his role in the force's Trident unit - which works to take down gangs within the city.\n\nPatel had until today said he was a Metropolitan Police officer on his LinkedIn profile. He said he was a 'highly motivated, skilled and professional individual'\n\nIn 2014, Patel (pictured with David Haye) hit the headlines when boxing champion David Haye was given a slap on the wrist rather than a speeding fine after posing for a 'selfie' with the PC who pulled him over\n\nAs part of their investigation into the shamed officer, the IOPC found evidence suggesting he lied to his colleague about how and when he obtained the woman's number.\n\nIt was also found that PC Patel had accessed records relating to the woman without any policing purpose to do so.\n\nLast month, at a misconduct hearing, a panel found that PC Patel had abused his position as a police officer.\n\nHe resigned from the force ahead of the hearing but the panel deemed his actions amounted to gross misconduct and he would have been dismissed if still employed.\n\nHe has now been placed on the College of Policing's barred list.\n\nMr Naseem said: 'This was a terrible betrayal of his role, it undermines public confidence and this sort of predatory behaviour has no place in policing.\n\n'It serves only to undermine the hard work and endeavour of the vast majority of serving police officers who are equally outraged by this conduct.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police confirmed Patel (pictured) had gross misconduct found proven. It said he 'engaged in a course of conduct by which he sought to establish or pursue an improper or inappropriate sexual or emotional relationship with a female'\n\n'I am pleased that the independent panel has reinforced the message that this sort of behaviour by police officers is never acceptable.'\n\nIn 2014, Patel hit the headlines when boxing champion David Haye was given a slap on the wrist rather than a speeding fine after posing for a 'selfie' with the PC who pulled him over.\n\nHaye posed for a 'selfie' with one of Patel, who later tweeted the image, saying: 'When we met after you were 'enjoying' your car.'\n\nThe photo shows Haye smiling at the camera with his arm slung around PC Patel, who is dressed in uniform and also grinning broadly.\n\nPatel had until today said he was a Metropolitan Police officer on his LinkedIn profile. He said he was a 'highly motivated, skilled and professional individual.'\n\nBut the profile was taken down after he was approached by the Sun Online.\n\nHe said: 'I decline to comment, there's nothing I want to say.'\n\nThe Metropolitan Police confirmed Patel had gross misconduct found proven.\n\nA spokesman said: 'PC Patel engaged in a course of conduct by which he sought to establish or pursue an improper or inappropriate sexual or emotional relationship with a female he came into contact with through his work.\n\n'It is further alleged that he misled a colleague as to how and why he had obtained the same female's contact details and he accessed police indices without a proper policing purpose at that time and later.\n\n'PC Patel, previously based within Specialist Crime, resigned from the Metropolitan Police with effect from 15 September 2019.\n\n'The hearing found that if he had still been a serving officer, PC Patel would have been dismissed without notice.'", "description": "PC Hitesh Patel,\u00a0based at Stoke Newington Police Station, arrested the woman in August 2016 and obtained her telephone number after she returned to the police station to be charged.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/16/20182822-0-image-a-70_1572016608192.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
