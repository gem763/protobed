But eight years ago, when the staff and volunteers were looking for a new type of fall festival to introduce, they skipped the fruits and veggies for something a little more universally craved: bacon.\n\nThe first PA Bacon Fest was a four-hour event on market day. It grew to a two-day festival that the organizers say draws about 80,000 attendees and is the year\u2019s biggest fundraiser for the nonprofit Greater Easton Development Partnership, which runs the market and other programs in the small eastern Pennsylvania city. (It\u2019s pay as you go, with a $2 suggested donation at the entrance.)\n\nMore than 150 vendors selling all things bacon set up over the two days, this year on Saturday and Sunday, November 2 and 3, to go with cooking demonstrations, hog calling contests, pig races, bacon-eating contests, costume contests (bacon-themed, of course), events geared towards kids and live music across multiple stages.\n\nThe Greater Easton Development Partnership runs the Easton Farmers' Market and organizes the bacon festival \u2014 Photo courtesy of Meghan Moyer / Discover Lehigh Valley\n\nEaston, known as the headquarters of the Crayola crayon company, is about a 90-minute drive west from New York City, and 90 minutes north of Philadelphia. No matter where you're coming from, bacon on breakfast plates, piled on cheeseburgers, tucked into a Bloody Mary cocktail, or even coated in chocolate is easy to find \u2014 but have you ever tried salty, fatty bacon wrapped around fluffy cannoli cream, or a bacon and beer pairing?\n\nBacon and beer\n\nAt the PA Bacon Fest\u2019s main tasting event ($20), Easton-based Weyerbacher Brewing will be matching up eight of its craft beers, like Chocolate Pretzel Sunday Morning Stout, with eight different kinds of bacon from Breakaway Farms in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.\n\nBacon mac and cheese\n\nSoak up that beer with bacon-topped mac and cheese. It's a popular item at the festival, available at Bacon Me Crazy, Bayou, Just Fudge It & The Cheesy Dawg, Kath\u2019s Catering, Cone Appetit and Mary, the Queen of Pork.\n\nBacon plus banana and peanut butter\n\nPeanut butter, banana, chocolate and bacon get packed into a cone made out of bread at the PA Bacon Fest \u2014 Photo courtesy of Cone Appetit / Discover Lehigh Valley\n\nCone Appetit is also serving its variation on the king of rock 'n' roll\u2019s favorite sandwich with the Elvis, a mix of peanut butter, banana and applewood-smoked bacon in a bread cone under a drizzle of chocolate ganache. Or ask for a Fat Elvis at Waffl\u2019d to get a waffle on a stick with bacon, peanut butter and sliced banana.\n\nBacon burgers and loafs\n\nAt Oak, the bacon is mixed into the burger \u2014 Photo courtesy of Oak Steakhouse / Discover Lehigh Valley\n\nA bacon burger usually means strips of bacon layered between the buns, but Oak Steakhouse\u2019s Bacon Fest burger is made of half ground beef, half ground bacon. The patty is topped with bacon jam, aioli and crispy onions.\n\nPorters' Pub & Restaurant has a similar idea with a slightly different execution, blending half ground bacon and half ground beef for a thick meatloaf sandwich.\n\nBacon-topped pizzas and nachos\n\nSwap out tortilla chips for pork rinds \u2014 Photo courtesy of Buck's BBQ / Discover Lehigh Valley\n\nPazzo Pizza is piling bacon and pineapple or bacon, chicken and ranch on its pies, while the Little Sicilian is filling its arancini (fried rice balls) with \u2013 what else? \u2013 bacon.\n\nOr you can double the pork with pork rind \"nachos\" stacked with pulled pork, bacon, a five-cheese sauce, pickled jalape\u00f1os, sour cream and green onions at Bucks BBQ.\n\nBacon and poutine\n\nThe Flying V is serving a few types of poutine at the PA Bacon Fest \u2014 Photo courtesy of The Flying V / Discover Lehigh Valley\n\nFor poutine smothered in chopped bacon, there\u2019s The Cow & The Curd or the Flying V, which is also doing a Canadian bacon poutine and a barbecue pulled pork version.\n\nTexas twinkie\n\nSave room for the Texas twinkie \u2014 Photo courtesy of Black & Blue / Discover Lehigh Valley\n\nBlack & Blue keeps it all-American with its take on a \"Texas twinkie:\" chorizo wrapped in colby-jack cheese and sweet Italian sausage, latticed in bacon, and then sliced and served on a cheddar biscuit with barbecue sauce.\n\nBacon baklava\n\nIf twinkie has you thinking dessert, there\u2019s bacon with a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern twist at Billy\u2019s Downtown Diner and Bull & Bear Restaurant, both serving a sweet-salty bacon baklava.\n\nBacon sweets\n\nBite into a salty-sweet cookie sandwich \u2014 Photo courtesy of Barry's Buns / Discover Lehigh Valley\n\nAlso on the sweet side, Barry\u2019s Buns sees how many ways it can incorporate bacon with a menu of drinking chocolate topped with candied bacon crumbles, a chocolate-covered bacon parfait, a bourbon bacon cookie sandwich, a maple bacon Li\u00e8ge-style waffle and honey-glazed bacon sticky buns with maple cream cheese icing.\n\nOr don\u2019t bother with the baking: Buttercups Bake Shoppe is on hand with ready-to-eat bacon peanut butter cookie dough.\n\nSette Luna cooks up a bacon shell for its cannoli \u2014 Photo courtesy of Ryan Hulvat / Meris Inc.\n\nStop by the Sette Luna table for a bacon cannoli that may be even more bacon-y than you\u2019re picturing \u2013 rather than cream studded with bits of bacon or a strip laid on top, this is a full-on house-cured crispy bacon shell folded around maple mascarpone and ricotta cream.\n\nBacon secrets\n\nIf that\u2019s not decadent enough, this year there\u2019s a secret menu with its own code phrase: \"hog wild.\" Utter the code when you order the cannoli to add sweet bacon icing and spicy bacon bits.\n\nAt Two Rivers Brewing Company, if you ask for the peanut butter bacon cheddar burger, you\u2019ll get a half-pound beef burger with cheddar, bacon, peanut butter, pecan praline dust and chili gastrique on brioche \u2013 but say \"hog wild\" and that burger somehow gets stacked even higher, with potato chips and banana rum chutney. Like the rest of the PA Bacon Fest, this one may be more for the \"pigging\" out set than the \"pace yourself\" crowd.", "description": "Easton, Pennsylvania's fall festival devoted to bacon is packed with salty-sweet treats, eating contests, pig races and live music.", "authors": ["Rachel Vigoda"], "top_image": "https://img2.10bestmedia.com/Images/Photos/372691/Sette-Luna--Bacon-Cannoli-Ryan-Hulvat-Meris-Inc.-2019_54_990x660.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
