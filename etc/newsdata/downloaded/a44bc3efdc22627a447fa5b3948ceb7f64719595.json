They are confronted with an investing landscape that contains sufficient risks to be fearful of but lacks the bullish pointers that would warrant a contrarian posture.\n\n\"Institutional investors are cautious, but they kind of feel like they're stuck,\" said Lori Heinel, the deputy chief investment officer of State Street Global Advisors, which manages nearly $2.9 trillion in assets.\n\n\"They can't just get out of equities because they need the returns,\" she told Business Insider in a recent interview. \"They're afraid of missing out because this market has been so choppy and surprisingly resilient. But they're also looking at hedges, buffers, and other ways to truncate some of the tail risk.\"\n\nThese comments check out when one looks at the data on large investors' holdings.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Marko Kolanovic, JPMorgan's global head of macro quant and derivative strategy, shared the following two charts to show that investors' views on stocks had become strained.\n\nFirst, hedge funds' exposure to equities is near its lowest level since the financial crisis.\n\nJPMorgan\n\nIn addition, investor sentiment as measured by the AAII bull-bear indicator has deteriorated to levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis and the market meltdowns in 2015 and 2018.\n\nJPMorgan\n\n\"As the US-China trade war destabilizes the global economy,\" Kolanovic said, and President Donald Trump's tweets \"continue destabilizing financial markets, many managers find it difficult to be invested in equity markets.\"\n\nHe added: \"The uncertainty brought about by the trade war has erased confidence built over a decade in the equity markets, in our view, both with more sophisticated investors (hedge funds) and individual investors alike.\"\n\nRead more: GOLDMAN SACHS: The stampede out of stock-market favorites is a preview of more extreme moves to come. Here's how to single out the ultimate winners.\n\nThe bottom line is that many investors aren't seizing this deadlock as a contrarian buying opportunity.\n\nThis might be such an occasion, according to Michael Hartnett, the chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He said in a recent note that the firm's bull-and-bear indicator flashed a contrarian \"buy\" signal for the first time since January.\n\nBut his observation came with a warning on what the flipside could look like. Investors' recession fears triggered an exodus from stocks and a record $160 billion flow into bond funds that inflated the asset class. A disorderly exit from bonds could trigger a spike in interest rates and, consequently, a recession, according to Hartnett.\n\nThe 'most complex' time to invest\n\nHe laid out one specific scenario of how the downside risks might unfold across markets. Meanwhile, investors have their eyes on a broader factor at play: This business cycle appears to be in its twilight period.\n\n\"The late cycle is the most complex and challenging period of the market cycle and of the economic cycle,\" said Erik Knutzen, the multi-asset-class chief investment officer at Neuberger Berman, a $333 billion manager.\n\n\"That's what investors are reacting to,\" he told Business Insider. \"I think they are, quite potentially, paralyzed at this point.\"\n\nKnutzen's advice for responding to this predicament is to consider parts of the world with economic cycles that aren't as mature as the US's and nascent themes like 5G technology and autonomous driving.\n\nThe Vanguard FTSE Emerging Market exchange-traded fund, the iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF, and the Defiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF are three ways to invest in these recommendations.", "description": "The uncertainty stems largely from the trade war and has left investors feeling trapped, money managers told Business Insider.", "authors": ["Akin Oyedele"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7a8b7e2e22af1d03213304-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
