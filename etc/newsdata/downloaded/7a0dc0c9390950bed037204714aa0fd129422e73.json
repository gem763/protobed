But a man answered.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re not my friend!\u2019 I said in confusion. \u2018No,\u2019 he said, in a low, gentle voice. \u2018But won\u2019t I do instead?\u2019\n\nI\u2019d dialled the wrong number, a number that would change my life.\n\nAlison Cork who met her husband Efi (pictured together), after accidentally dialing the wrong number revealed how their relationship has progressed almost 20 years later\n\nEfi\u2019s voice entranced me. We shared a few minutes of banter, then I reluctantly hung up.\n\nAt the time I was 35 and single, having ended a 13-year relationship because my boyfriend didn\u2019t want children and I did.\n\nI wasn\u2019t looking for love but Efi had sounded sane, funny and very kind. After a few minutes\u2019 deliberation, I pressed redial.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s me again,\u2019 I said, telling him I\u2019d enjoyed our brief chat so much. He was on a work phone, unable to trace my number. He said he was glad I\u2019d called back.\n\nAfter three weeks of lengthy phone conversations, we decided to meet and I felt just as comfortable with him in person. Six months later I\u2019ve agreed to marry him.\n\nWHAT I DID NEXT\n\nHow astonishing to think this was nearly 20 years ago. Efi and I had our simple, beautiful wedding in 2000. Meanwhile, the story of how we met caught the world\u2019s attention.\n\nAn American TV company even made a half-hour film about us, Beyond Chance, for the Romance Channel. Cringingly, we played ourselves. The closing scene had us walking off into the sunset together: the ultimate happy ending.\n\nAlison was a 35-year-old singleton when she met Efi - seven years her junior, the pair had a simple wedding in 2000\n\nBut real life is, of course, made up of highs and lows.\n\nI\u2019d parted from my much-older ex, as he didn\u2019t want children and I just couldn\u2019t bear to give up on my dream of having them. Efi, seven years my junior at 28, was his polar opposite, insisting he wanted a large family \u2014 four children \u2014 as much as I did.\n\nBut things didn\u2019t turn out to be as easy as that. The wedding date set, we began trying for a baby. Sadly, I miscarried, which was very upsetting for us both.\n\nCringingly, we played ourselves in a film about how we met\n\nWe shared the joy of our eldest son\u2019s birth in our first year of marriage; then the sorrow of losing three more babies before our second child was born in 2004. By then I was 41. It felt as if time had run away from us.\n\nWe agreed that our fantastic boys David and Ethan \u2014 now 15 and 18 \u2014 completed our family, and we would focus on providing the best life that we could give them.\n\nWe were both running our own businesses: Efi in property and finance, while I had founded my Alison at Home interiors brand. I also launched the Make It Your Business initiative, in support of female entrepreneurs.\n\nHaving started our life together in a rented basement flat, over the next decade we worked our way up the property ladder. The drill was: buy, renovate, sell, repeat. We did that seven exhausting times. Finally, in 2009, we moved into our forever home, a beautiful townhouse in London\u2019s Belgravia.\n\nThe mother-of-two (pictured) says she and Efi remain very much in love, she has recently put herself forward as prospective Conservative Mayor of London 2020\n\nBoth self-made, we were utterly determined to give our boys a private education and a wonderful home to grow up in.\n\nWe have other interests, too: I recently put myself forward as prospective Conservative Mayor of London 2020.\n\nEfi and I remain very much in love. I always pinch myself when I think back to how a wrong number put us together.\n\nBut the ultimate proof of our relationship\u2019s success is our children. We couldn\u2019t be prouder of our sons \u2014 our youngest fences for England, while his big brother writes and sings jazz.\n\nI know people will look at me and think: \u2018You really did get your perfect fairy-tale ending.\u2019 In some ways they\u2019d be right. But underpinning everything Efi and I have built is relentless effort.\n\nChance might have brought us together, but we\u2019re the ones who\u2019ve made it work ever since.\n\nInterview by Rachel Halliwell", "description": "Alison Cork who wrote about meeting her now husband Efi , by accidentally dialing his number almost 20 years ago, reveals what happened in the years following.", "authors": ["Alison Cork For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/22/19808052-0-image-a-23_1571260471794.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
