He was 90.\n\nA spokeswoman confirmed his death and issued a statement on behalf of the family which said \u201cthe city of Detroit, the United States and the world [had] lost a fearless civil rights leader and hero\u201d.\n\nConyers, the statement said, \u201cwas a devoted father and husband and his world revolved around securing justice against racial and economic discrimination \u2026 his legacy and advocacy for human rights will live on forever.\u201d\n\nElected as one of only six black members of the House in 1964, Conyers served until 2017. A co-founder member of the Congressional Black Caucus, he had a storied career. He was for example the only member of the House judiciary committee to take part in impeachment proceedings against both Richard Nixon, in 1974, and Bill Clinton in 1998.\n\nBut that career came to an abrupt end in 2017, when Conyers was the subject of extensive allegations of sexual misconduct including a case that was settled in private.\n\nHe claimed the allegations were \u201cnot accurate\u201d and said he was stepping down for health-related reasons.\n\nMy legacy can\u2019t be compromised or diminished in any way by what we are going through now John Conyers\n\n\u201cMy legacy can\u2019t be compromised or diminished in any way by what we are going through now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis too shall pass.\u201d\n\nConyers was born and grew up in Detroit, the city he would represent, where his father was a union organiser. He insisted his son, a jazz aficionado, should not become a musician.\n\nJazz remained one of Conyers\u2019 \u201cgreat pleasures\u201d. He sponsored legislation to forgive the $1.6m tax debt of band leader Woody Herman\u2019s estate and once kept a bass in his Washington office.\n\nBefore heading to Congress, Conyers served in the national guard and with the US Army Corps of Engineers during the Korean war, supervising aircraft repairs. He earned degrees from Wayne State University in the late 1950s.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1961 he worked as a legislative assistant to John Dingell, another Michigan Democrat who when he retired in 2014 at 88 was the longest-serving member of Congress, a mantle that passed to Conyers.\n\nIn 1964, Conyers won his first congressional election by just 108 votes. It was however the beginning of more than 50 years of dominance at the polls, during which Conyers regularly won with more than 80% of the vote, even after his wife went to prison for taking a bribe.\n\nConyers was able to speak his mind. In 2004, he said President George W Bush had been \u201can absolute disaster for the African American community\u201d. In 1979, he called President Jimmy Carter \u201ca hopeless, demented, honest, well-intentioned nerd who will never get past his first administration\u201d. Carter didn\u2019t.\n\nIn July 1967, parts of Detroit were burned during riots sparked by hostilities between black residents and the mostly white police force. Conyers\u2019 district office was gutted by fire. The plight of the nation\u2019s inner cities would remain a key cause.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest On 23 July 1967, Conyers uses a bullhorn to encourage African Americans in Detroit\u2019s riot area to go home.

After a 15-year fight, he won passage of legislation declaring Rev Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s birthday a national holiday, first celebrated in 1986. Starting in 1989, he regularly introduced a bill to study the harm caused by slavery and the possibility of reparations. It never got past a subcommittee.\n\nConyers\u2019 office in Detroit employed the civil rights legend Rosa Parks from 1965 until her retirement in 1988. In 2005, Conyers was one of 11 people inducted to the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame.\n\nIn 2013, he was fiercely opposed to Detroit being taken over by a state-appointed emergency manager as the city declared bankruptcy.\n\nHe became chairman of the House judiciary committee in 2006, overseeing hearings the next year into the White House\u2019s role in the firing of eight federal prosecutors and in 2009 on how the NFL dealt with head injuries to players.\n\nHe was also an early supporter of then-senator Barack Obama, who was expected by some in the Congressional Black Caucus to push public health insurance, sharp funding increases for urban development and other initiatives long blocked by Republicans.\n\n\u201cWe want him to stand strong,\u201d Conyers said.\n\nHe was touched by scandal. In 2009, his wife Monica Conyers, a Detroit city councilwoman, pleaded guilty to bribery related to a sludge hauling contract. She spent nearly two years in prison.\n\nThree years earlier, the House ethics committee closed a three-year investigation of allegations that Conyers\u2019 staff worked on political campaigns and were ordered to babysit his two children and run personal errands. He promised changes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Conyers greets President Obama in Detroit in 2016.

She alleged she was fired because she rejected his sexual advances. Others said they had witnessed inappropriate behaviour.\n\nConyers initially said he looked forward vindicating himself and his family. But opposition from colleagues including Nancy Pelosi, then minority leader, proved too much to bear. His seat was won by Rashida Tlaib, one of the first Muslim women in Congress.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Pelosi saluted a life \u201clived in service to achieving true equality in America\u201d and said Conyers\u2019 leadership made a difference in the lives of countless Americans\u201d.\n\nAlong with his wife, Conyers is survived by two sons, John III and Carl.\n\nIn quotes provided by the family spokeswoman, Monica Conyers said: \u201cMy husband was a fighter; when your back was up against a wall, he was right there with you. Not just for me, but for everyone.\u201d\n\nHis sons saluted his ability \u201cto stay dignified when facing a challenge\u201d and said he \u201cexemplified grace with everyone he met\u201d.", "description": "Michigan congressman co-founded Congressional Black Caucus but his resignation in 2017 followed allegations of sexual misconduct", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7c496d9c39c3170bb3eed9e15b51dc91b5d264e/0_129_3584_2151/master/3584.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d9109005b308fbef5a4534334e41d6a6", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
