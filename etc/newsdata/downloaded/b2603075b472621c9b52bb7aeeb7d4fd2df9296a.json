The couple had fled Mississippi with their 3-month-old daughter during Hurricane Katrina.\n\nCALIFORNIA APPEALS COURT OVERTURNS SOLE CONVICTION IN KATE STEINLE DEATH\n\nProsecutors said Magee shot Rodgers multiples times at a Columbus apartment. She died with her daughter on a bed in the next room, they said.\n\nCourt reporter Sharon Dilleshaw transcribed Magee's three-day trial, weeks after her professional certification was suspended. She also filed a partial transcript filled with errors. Trial transcripts document the trial, from the evidence presented to remarks from the judge, lawyers and witnesses.\n\nDilleshaw's certification was suspended because she failed to renew it.\n\nIn 2013, attorneys for Magee filed objections to his conviction over the botched transcript. Rummer, who did not preside over the first trial, found an average of 4.6 errors per page, for a total of 1,384 mistakes, according to the paper.\n\nSeparate audio records were also incomplete, leading Rumer to conclude that there was \u201cno other method available to produce a true and accurate record of the Magee trial.\u201d\n\n\u201cTypically, Dilleshaw will begin talking and following the testimony, but she stops and falls off quickly into silence,\u201d Rumer wrote. \u201cThere are many times when Dilleshaw will whisper gibberish into the mask.\"\n\n\u201cIt was a ruse to make all believe that she was taking it down word for word.
