They were all about taxing and spending. Ergo, nearly two-thirds of Canadians voted for free root canals or free daycare or free pharmaceuticals or free college. And 7.7 per cent voted for the Bloc, or to get more free stuff for Quebec. This is a nation that thinks like a bunch of trust fund kids, who despoil the environment more than our parents or grandparents did, and believe the world owes them a living.\n\nThe poster boy was Canada\u2019s most prominent trust funder, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who flitted around in two fuel-guzzling aircraft during his election campaign while endlessly repeating the mantra \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\nAnd nearly two-thirds fell for it. He and the Liberal climate-change cohorts \u2014 the NDP and Greens \u2014 claimed that Canada would lead the world in averting the impending ecological Armageddon by simply declaring war against its principle wealth-creation sectors, resources and auto manufacturing.\n\nEven if one is sympathetic to the need to transition from the old to the new economy, there is not a single entrepreneur, technology maven, scientist, or innovator among the ranks of the tax-and-spenders to lead us to their Promised Land. Their culprit is oil and pipelines.\n\nBut if serious, their platforms should have taxed anyone occupying more than 500 square feet of living space, those who drive, fly and consume more goods and resources, as Canadians do, than do most of the world\u2019s residents.\n\nInstead, Canadians vote for leaders who promise to save the planet, but allow them to continue to commute long distances along asphalt highways, drive SUVs, fly south, drink water out of plastic bottles, are addicted to electronic devices that consume huge amounts of electricity, live and work in oversized and air conditioned premises, eat packaged foods, use paper cups and towels, and pack landfill sites with manufactured goods shipped halfway around the world only to be prematurely discarded.\n\nThe surging demand in monster houses, empty condos built in Canada for money laundering purposes, the dominance of SUVs, and mass immigration to high-consumption Canada from low consumption countries more than cancels out any environmental benefit from electric cars or renewables or Trudeau\u2019s foolish carbon tax. The fact is that world and Canadian oil demand, like gasoline guzzlers and population, will be on the rise for years to come.\n\nVoters who want to make a real impact should turn off all air conditioning, plug their leaky houses, stop having children, downsize, sell their vehicles, walk and use public transport, and lower their thermostats and wear sweaters.\n\nInstead, they vote for a privileged prime minister who claims Canadians voted for climate change concerns and campaigns with two jets and others who don\u2019t walk the talk. Real environmentalists would have video-conferenced their campaigns, and distributed their propaganda by email, not through paper posters, billboards and pamphlets.\n\nTheir hypocrisy was unchallenged by a mostly biased press because the green brigade has captured Canada\u2019s public-policy space. The greenies run without policies to dramatically reduce demand for resources, and run without concern about creating jobs, exports or economic growth.\n\nThey scapegoat Alberta and Saskatchewan, as if oil supply is the problem, not demand. And Canada\u2019s hypocrites lapped it up and spat out support for four thoroughly unworthy parties.\n\nBut there is one climate change the minority Liberal government will create if it fails to lift restrictions on resources and the TMX pipeline. Winter will come \u2026 for Canada as a united, prosperous nation.\n\nFinancial Post", "description": "Voters who want to make a real impact should turn off all air conditioning, stop having children, downsize, sell their vehicles and lower their thermostats", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/trudeau-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
