Unlike in previous decades, some of the most serious of these threats are cyber-related.\n\nOn Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats released the intelligence community\u2019s annual Worldwide Threat Assessment, which identifies and evaluates these various threats to the nation.\n\nHere are three key cyber-related takeaways from the report.\n\n1. China and Russia have unprecedented power to target our infrastructure and population.\n\nAmerica\u2019s global rivals, especially China and Russia, are aggressively challenging us economically, socially, and politically\u2014and they\u2019re doing so effectively. Just consider these conclusions from the report:\n\n\u201c[T]he innovations that drive military and economic competitiveness will increasingly originate outside of the United States as the overall U.S. lead in science and technology shrinks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe assess that China\u2019s intelligence services will exploit the openness of American society, especially academia and the scientific community \u2026 .\u201d\n\n\u201cMoscow is now staging cyber-attack assets to allow it to disrupt or damage U.S. civilian and military infrastructure during a crisis and poses a significant cyber influence threat \u2026 .\u201d\n\n\u201cChina has the ability to launch cyber-attacks that cause localized, temporary disruptive effects on critical infrastructure\u2014such as disruption of a natural gas pipeline for days to weeks\u2014in the United States.\n\n\u201cU.S. adversaries and strategic competitors almost certainly will use online influence operations to try to weaken democratic institutions, undermine U.S. alliances and partnerships, and shape policy outcomes \u2026 .\u201d\n\nNote especially that Russia and China are not simply trying to establish the capability to attack our critical infrastructure and to influence our population. The intelligence community states they can undertake those attacks today.\n\n2. Economic health and competitiveness are critical to national security.\n\nThe director of national intelligence\u2019s assessment clearly explains that the technology sector is a key battleground in this strategic competition.\n\n[T]he U.S. economy will be challenged by slower global economic growth and growing threats to U.S. economic competitiveness.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina will continue to use legal, political, and economic levers\u2014such as the lure of Chinese markets\u2014to shape the information environment.\u201d\n\n\u201c[F]oreign actors [will] increase their efforts to acquire top talent, companies, data, and intellectual property via licit and illicit means.\u201d\n\nBottom line: The American private sector is now a decisive actor, capability, and battleground in the modern national security context.\n\n3. The age of cyberwarfare is here, and the scale of the threat is outstripping our ability to defend.\n\nIn addition to the statements about Russia and China\u2019s current capabilities mentioned above, the Worldwide Threat Assessment reports the following:\n\n\u201cChina, Russia, Iran, and North Korea increasingly use cyber operations to threaten both minds and machines in an expanding number of ways\u2014to steal information, to influence our citizens, or to disrupt critical infrastructure.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor years, they have conducted cyber espionage to collect intelligence and targeted our critical infrastructure to hold it at risk. They are now becoming more adept at using social media to alter how we think, behave, and decide.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we connect and integrate billions of new digital devices into our lives and business processes, adversaries and strategic competitors almost certainly will gain greater insight into and access to our protected information.\u201d\n\nHaving served as an intelligence officer for more than 15 years, I can attest that our intelligence community is not prone to hyperbole. They understand very well that their words and analysis shape life-and-death decisions as well as billion-dollar budgets.\n\nAs such, we need to heed this report and its conclusions.\n\nIn the face of these cyber threats, our nation lacks a coherent cyber doctrine. We need a cyber doctrine that proactively defines U.S. intentions and interests in cyberspace; clearly articulates online actions that we want to encourage, and those that will not be tolerated; and ultimately changes our adversaries\u2019 political calculus so that they no longer think it is worth the risk of provoking the U.S. in the digital domain.\n\nLast year, the director of national intelligence said that the warning lights for our national security are \u201cblinking red.\u201d His Worldwide Threat Assessment makes clear that those lights are still flashing, and may even be on solid red in some instances, when it comes to the threats these adversaries represent.", "description": "The United States is facing a wave of new threats from abroad.
