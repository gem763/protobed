Leclerc is 107 points behind the British driver.\n\nMax Verstappen finished fourth ahead of Red Bull team-mate Alex Albon, who started last after he crashed out of qualifying.\n\n\u201cWhat an effort, guys,\u201d said a jubilant Hamilton on the radio. \u201cWhat an incredible job. That is exactly what we needed. We never give up.\u201d\n\nFerrari had already got themselves into a needless mess before Vettel retired with an engine failure on lap 28.\n\nVettel got the jump on pole-sitter Leclerc on the long drag down to the second corner here, but a curious pre-race arrangement had Leclerc calling for the roles to be reversed.\n\nSeemingly it had been agreed that if Vettel benefited from the slipstream and moved ahead of Leclerc off the start line, he would have to concede the position.\n\nFerrari were on the radio to tell Vettel to let Leclerc by, but the four-time world champion resisted the order.\n\nLeclerc protested from his cockpit. \u201cYou put me behind and I respected everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will talk later.\u201d\n\nThe Ferrari pit wall were on to Vettel again, but again the German did not want to budge, fearing that he would be exposed to Hamilton if he slowed down.\n\nLeclerc was the first to stop on lap 22, but instead of calling in Vettel the next time around, as would be the expected protocol, Vettel was left on old tyres as his team-mate lit up the time sheets on new rubber.\n\nFour laps after Leclerc pitted, Vettel was eventually stopped, and by the time he emerged he had fallen behind his team-mate and into a net second.\n\nFerrari had got their wish, but just moments after leaving the pits, Vettel broke down with an engine failure. \u201cBring back the f****** V12s,\u201d yelled Vettel with Ferrari blaming his retirement on the hybrid technology.\n\nIt was then to get worse for the Scuderia. With Vettel\u2019s broken down machine in a precarious position, the virtual safety car was deployed to slow down the field, allowing Hamilton, who had yet to pit, a free stop for tyres and the lead of the race.\n\nGeorge Russell then crashed out in his Williams and the full safety car was put on track. Ferrari decided to stop Leclerc and put him on new tyres for the remaining 20 laps.\n\nBut their decision saw him lose a position to Bottas, and on a track where overtaking is nigh-on impossible, Leclerc was unable to pass the Mercedes driver.\n\nHamilton crossed the line 3.8 seconds clear of his team-mate to claim his ninth win of the season and end Ferrari\u2019s three-round winning streak.\n\n\u201cIt is incredible to have this result considering how quick (Ferrari) were off the start,\u201d said Hamilton. \u201cTo keep up with them was an incredibly hard task.\u201d\n\nReflecting on his probable sixth title, the Mercedes driver added: \u201cI try not to think about the championship and take it one race at a time.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to stumble. It feels like a long time coming, but the first time, too, so that is why this win is special.\u201d\n\nLeclerc added: \u201cI will always trust the team but the tactic was me giving the slipstream and for us to be one-two, which happened, but then I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cI need to speak to the team to know the situation better.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Lewis Hamilton took advantage of a Ferrari meltdown to win the Russian Grand Prix and tighten his grip on a sixth world championship.
