MSNBC Reporter Thinks You Don't Understand the 'Sins of the President'", "language": "en", "text": "Democrats ran with the Russia collusion hoax for more than two years. They clung to it as their \"smoking gun\" to prove President Donald Trump colluded with Russia to interfere in our elections. Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded no collusion took place. Democrats didn't get their wish. They didn't have the \"ah ha!\" moment that would allow them to impeach President Trump. They doubled down when Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the call, Trump asked Zelensky to look into shady business dealings between Hunter Biden and a Ukrainian gas company. He was being paid $50,000 a month despite having no experience in natural energy. The one connection he did have, however, was that his father, Joe Biden, was vice president and working on international relations dealing with Ukraine.\n\nSee how swampy that is? It doesn't pass the smell test. And it shouldn't, regardless of what political party you belong to. But, according to MSNBC contributor Dylan Byers, only the liberal media and lefties understand \"the sins of the president.\"\n\n\"He [Trump] can\u2019t resist the fight, the Twitter spats, the media spats. He can\u2019t resist being the headline. But I was talking this morning and last night with folks I know who have either worked with the president or folks who have spent a significant amount of time sitting with the president, and what they tell me is there\u2019s also a very strategic effort here, which is complicate the narrative,\" Byers said.\n\n\"Make everything just seem harder. Put people in a position where it becomes harder to understand who is telling the truth, who is being more outrageous. Make everything seem just a little more chaotic to the point where if you\u2019re voters you either tune out or just decide you don\u2019t know who to believe,\" Byers explained. \"Or if you\u2019re a lawmaker, you basically have cover with your constituents because they feel like they don\u2019t necessarily trust the media. They feel like they don\u2019t necessarily trust the Democrats any more than they can trust the President of the United States.\"\n\n\"The president sent 240 tweets this week. Only about five of them came anywhere near a legislative agenda. Can the president successfully say 'We\u2019ve got do-nothing Democrats' when those people who might want to drown out the media know what\u2019s actually getting done in their home towns?\" host Stephanie Ruhle asked.\n\n\"I think we\u2019re well beyond legislative arguments and policy arguments when it comes to the sentiments of the American people or at least the fight that the president is trying to wage. This is very much an emotional fight. I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a fight for the narrative. I think it\u2019s more just a fight for sort of the hearts and minds of people who are feeling in increasingly confused by this whole process,\" Byers replied.\n\n\"I think if you have been watching our network or if you\u2019ve been reading The New York Times or the Washington Post, I think the sort of sins of the president make a lot of sense and it\u2019s sort of very easy to understand everything that he has done wrong,\" he said \"But let\u2019s not forget there\u2019s a wide swath of the country watching Fox News or a wide swath of the country that doesn\u2019t believe anything that\u2019s printed. The more fuel he can add to the fire, the more he can give those networks, their viewers and readers the opportunity to just tune out of this out.\"\n\nThe American people don't trust the mainstream media because they have repeatedly lied over and over again. Just a few weeks ago the New York Times had a blunder over not including exculpatory evidence when launching new accusations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Americans have no faith in reporters or journalists because they're tired of the legacy media constantly trying to be part of the story instead of reporting it. They're tired of these well-revered newspapers and talking heads cherrypicking the facts to fit their narrative.\n\nIt's not that most Americans don't understand the \"sins of the president.\" Most Americans see through the lies that networks like CNN and MSNBC have pushed since Trump took office. And the networks' ratings prove that.\n\nEditor's Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Byers' title was \"MSNBC Contributor.\" He's actually a reporter.", "description": "Eye roll..10/05/2019 18:41:36PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/278/ca72402c-5690-4310-8aa7-b29d94aa9279.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
