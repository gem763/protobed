So a father whose daughter was joining in, took her on a shopping spree. (Photo: Allene Zenaida Gethers)\n\n\n\n\n\nRaising kind children is vital to Randy Smalls of South Carolina. So when he heard that his teen daughter was making fun of a classmate, he instilled a hard-to-forget lesson: Smalls took the girl on a shopping spree \u2014 with money meant for his daughter.\n\n\u201cI say, \u2018When you laugh along, you\u2019re co-signing the bullying,\u201d Smalls, 35, a father-of-three in Moncks Corner, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. Having been bullied in his own youth, he felt empathy for the seventh-grader at Berkeley Middle School named Ryan Reese.\n\nTurns out that Smalls\u2019s wife and Ryan\u2019s mother Richauna Reese are friends, however neither was aware that the girls had problems at school. The families got on the phone and after speaking to Ryan himself, Smalls shared his idea. \u201cI wanted to help Ryan so she wouldn\u2019t have this issue anymore,\u201d he tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nThe dad had planned to buy new clothes for his 13-year-old daughter, but given her behavior, he thought the money would be better spent toward a shopping spree for Ryan. \u201cMy daughter was upset, especially because she is into fashion,\u201d he says. \u201cSo she came with us and helped pick out Ryan\u2019s new clothes.\u201d The dad purchased pants, shirts, and shoes for Ryan, but he didn\u2019t stop there.\n\nWhile his daughter attended church, Smalls took Ryan to the beauty salon. \u201cWe got her hair done and we\u2019ll be paying for twice-a-month appointments until the end of the year,\u201d he tells Yahoo Lifestyle. Other local salons have donated services to ensure the little girl looks styled for the next few months.\n\nRelated: Online Bullying on the Rise Among Middle, High School Students\n\nRichauna, 44, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that Ryan has been struggling with the deaths of her father, grandfather, and aunt and the stress has been causing non-epileptic seizures. So the shopping spree put a smile on her face. \u201cThis is the first time I have seen a parent take such a stance on bullying,\u201d she says.\n\nLast year, a Houston, Texas dad also showed empathy when his 8-year-old son was being bullied at school, according to Good Morning America. Aubrey Fontenot reached out to his son\u2019s bully and hearing that the boy was also getting picked on for his clothes, he took him shopping. The two children formed an alliance and became \u201cbrothers.\u201d\n\nFontenot told GMA that he taught his son that \u201cevery war isn\u2019t won with your hands. It's easy to react to first emotions but sometimes you have to outsmart a situation.\"\n\nIn a 2018 survey of 160,000 secondary students in 27 states by the non-profit group YouthTruth, one-third say they\u2019ve been bullied over the last school year. Also, 40 percent of middle-schoolers were bullied compared to 27 percent of high school students in the 2017-2018 school year. According to StopBullying.gov, bystanders who intervene \u201cmake a huge difference.\u201d\n\nAs a 2013 study published in the Universal Journal of Educational Research found, people who bully enjoy having an audience for their behavior, and bystanders feel safe in their role compared to becoming a target. However, \u201cWatching without intervening actually reinforces bullying,\u201d reads the study.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Smalls wants all children \u2014 and parents \u2014 to understand from his unconventional example. He\u2019s recently started a local group called Parents Against Bullying. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect for this to get big but I\u2019m glad if other parents [can learn from it],\u201d he tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cMy daughter learned her lesson.\u201d\n\nAnd the relationship between Ryan and Small\u2019s daughter? \u201cThey\u2019re cool now,\u201d says Richauna.\n\n\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Randy Smalls of South Carolina felt empathy for a girl bullied by his daughter.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MwCI1KN_edQNELIjH9LlaA--~B/aD0xOTUwO3c9MTU2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/027ece90-f814-11e9-8f3f-a60470912b54", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
