(Photo: Dalvin Brown)\n\nIf your timeline is being inundated with celebrity lookalikes, that's because a new viral app has taken off.\n\nGradient Photo Editor allows users to upload a selfie or face photo and the app will use artificial intelligence to gradually turn them into a celebrity that they allegedly resemble. The photo editing app is just over a week old and has already amassed a huge celebrity following including the Kardashians and the record producer Diplo.\n\nThe app's results sometimes miss the mark.\n\nOne USA TODAY reporter's results included the Spanish soccer player Marc Bartra, rapper Tyler the Creator and Brazilian actress Giovanna Ewbank. However, people on social media are having fun with the idea that disgraced tech tycoon Elizabeth Holmes looks like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in disguise.\n\nRobot helpers: Gita is a new cargo robot that can follow you, carry your stuff for about 4 hours\n\nYahoo Groups is shutting down: Act soon or lose all your old photos, message history\n\nI love this app pic.twitter.com/L74tz7PNsw \u2014 eve peyser (@evepeyser) October 17, 2019\n\nThe app also suggests that Kim Kardashian looks like Cher and Diplo looks like musician Lil Nas X. According to the Google Play Store, Gradient has been downloaded over a million times and has a 4.3-star average review.\n\nIf you want to use the app, you can sign up for a free three-day trial. After the trial ends, you'll be charged either $4.99 per week or $19.99 a month unless you remember to cancel.\n\nNot that long ago, consumers had their eyes on FaceApp, which would show you how you could look when you get older. Soon after going viral, the app raised tons of questions about privacy after it was reported that a Russian startup was harvesting metadata from users.\n\nUnlike FaceApp, which owned the rights to the selfie-edits, Gradient \u201cdoes not claim ownership of Your Content that you upload or (stylize) through the Service,\" according to its terms of use.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/18/who-your-celebrity-lookalike-gradient-app-try-tell-you/4020203002/", "description": "Gradient Photo Editor allows users to upload a selfie or face\u00a0photo to view which celebrity they allegedly resemble.", "authors": ["Dalvin Brown", "Published A.M.
