If you want to skip to your favorite team or topic, use these timestamps:\n\n2:05: Mark, who is based in Los Angeles, discusses what percentage of local fans support the Lakers vs. the Clippers and what (if anything) the Clippers can do to close that gap a bit.\n\n7:20: LeBron James shot down talk of Lakers-Clippers being a rivalry after the first game, but it does seem like this could become a pretty intense back-and-forth over the next few years.\n\n9:25: Mark recently talked to Kawhi Leonard about what the Clippers did to bond and develop trust in each other early. He shares the Clippers\u2019 approach to getting everyone on the same page and how it differs a bit from what other teams typically do.\n\n12:50: Is it more difficult for players to bond with Leonard and get acclimated around him because he\u2019s so quiet and guarded? Or is it actually easier because he is so laid back and doesn\u2019t have many prima-donna qualities?\n\n15:30: Mark discusses the latest on Paul George\u2019s recovery and how long it likely will take this Clippers team to get to full strength.\n\n18:00: LeBron-led teams are unique because there\u2019s so much pressure to win and, because everything is blown out of proportion, the atmosphere around the team is somewhat circus-like. Mark talks about how the new Lakers are adjusting to LeBron and how certain players perform better in that environment.\n\n21:40: Mark points out that LeBron rubbed some of his teammates the wrong way last season. Brandon Ingram recently opened up to USA TODAY, calling the New Orleans Pelicans \u201ca better environment\u201d and emphasized that \u201cthere are a lot of genuine people here.\u201d Was that a subtle shot at LeBron?\n\n25:10: Being a Laker comes with its unique challenges. There\u2019s an off-court adjustment that players must make on top of everything else because the Laker lifestyle is so different. Alex and Mark discuss what that\u2019s like for players and how the new guys are handling the transition.\n\n28:25: Anthony Davis got his wish by landing on the Lakers. How is he liking Los Angeles? And what can the Lakers do to ensure he\u2019s happy and stays long-term?\n\n33:00: With Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, DeMarcus Cousins, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston and others gone or hurt, this Warriors team is very different. Has the perception of the Warriors changed among players?\n\n36:00: Mark talks about whether D\u2019Angelo Russell will remain with the Warriors for the long haul or if Golden State added him so that they could use him as a trade chip when the time is right.\n\n40.00: Stephen Curry is going to have the ball in his hands a ton with Durant gone and Thompson sidelined. Will we see Curry win his third Most Valuable Player award or does that seem like a long shot given how the Warriors plan to use him?\n\nFollow Alex Kennedy on Twitter @AlexKennedyNBA and Mark Medina @MarkG_Medina", "description": "On this episode of The HoopsHype Podcast, USA TODAY NBA reporter Mark Medina joins HoopsHype's Alex Kennedy to chat Lakers, Clippers and Warriors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/23/USAT/c03434eb-2d25-4dac-afef-c8ebc0dc38c4-2019-10-22_NBA17.jpg?crop=2428,1821,x334,y75&width=2428&height=1804&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
