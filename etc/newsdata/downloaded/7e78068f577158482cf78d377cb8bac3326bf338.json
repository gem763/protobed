This has also resulted in delayed industrialization of the continent.\n\n\"Despite huge resource endowments, a weak scientific base continues to hinder value addition of various raw materials, which continue to find relevance in export markets,\" he said.\n\nAdhere is of the opinion that African countries have no choice but to invest in science, technology and innovation, either individually or collectively, to realize the aspirations of Agenda 2063.\n\nHe said that countries should strengthen universities and research institutions through improved funding, better working conditions and technology-transfer partnerships.\n\nThis should coincide with collaboration among governments, academia, and industry or the private sector.\n\n\"Universities should undertake research and innovate. It is however the role of the private sector to invest in the commercialization of research and innovation outputs,\" Adhere said.\n\nHe said African countries have many case studies around the world to learn from, citing China as a good example.\n\nClassified as a developing economy barely three decades ago, Adhere said China has registered a phenomenal rise in scientific and technological innovation, becoming one of the strongest contributors to human wellbeing.\n\nRaissa Malu, head of technical support unit in the Ministry of Primary, Secondary and Vocational Education in the Democratic Republic of Congo, said governments across Africa have not factored in the importance of research in economic development.\n\nMalu said many governments are unaware of what's happening in research centers, despite research being vital for economic development.\n\nShe said there is need for forums where government, researchers and higher learning institutions can meet to discuss ongoing studies and improve research funding.\n\n\"Governments should give a chance to scientists to provide solutions to the problems affecting society. Through research, African countries can add value to their products, thus increasing their exports,\" she said.\n\nMalu spoke of the need for public-private partnerships to ensure universities offer more practical training for the benefit of society and industry.\n\n\"Industry should also help universities to catch up with technological advancement,\" she said.\n\nAdopted in 205, the African Union (AU) Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa 2024 encourages countries to allocate at least one per cent of GDP toward research and development to ensure that the continent maximizes ownership and responsibility for its own development path.\n\nAccording to the African Technology Policy Studies Network, in the entire Sub-Saharan Africa, only South Africa is approaching the AU's recommended target expenditure on research and development. Other countries are investing less that 0.5 percent of their GDP.\n\nThrough the science, technology and innovation strategy, AU expects member countries to eradicate hunger, achieve food security as well as prevent and control diseases.\n\nThis is in addition to physical and intellectual mobility, protection of space, building society, and wealth creation.", "description": "Increased investment in science, technology and innovation will be critical for Africa to realize its Agenda 2063, a blueprint and masterplan for transforming the continent into a global powerhouse, analysts have said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/09/5d9d9bb4a310cf3e97a05492.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
