NASA officials said the station crew was never in any danger. NASA\n\nBased on telemetry and the performance of the Soyuz, engineers believe the culprit may have been a faulty amplifier in the KURS rendezvous equipment inside the space station. The amplifier is part of a system that sends signals to an approaching Soyuz that are used by the ship's computer to help calculate the proper approach trajectory.\n\nSeveral hours after the missed approach, the Russian space agency Roscosmos posted a statement saying the proposed plan forward calls for Skvortsov, Morgan and Parmitano to strap into the Soyuz MS-13/59S spacecraft that carried them into orbit last month, undock from the Zvezda module's aft port and manually re-dock at the Poisk module.\n\nAll Soyuz pilots are trained to fly their ships manually and the suspect KURS system used in the aborted automated approach to the Poisk port will not be utilized.\n\nAssuming the relocation goes well, the Soyuz MS-14/60S spacecraft would be directed to attempt an automated docking at the vacant Zvezda port. The proposal requires the approval of all the station's international partners.\n\n\"On August 27 (Moscow time), the second automatic docking attempt will take place, with the Soyuz MS-14 docking to the Zvezda module,\" Roscosmos said in the web posting. \"Tomorrow, Alexander Skvortsov will take additional training according to the normal procedure using the onboard simulator to redock the Soyuz MS-13.\n\n\"The situation is complicated, however is under control.\"\n\nThe Soyuz MS-14/60S spacecraft was launched Wednesday night U.S. time from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Instead of a crew, the three-seat ferry ship carried 1,450 pounds of cargo and an experimental robot known as the Skybot F-850.\n\nThe primary goal of the flight was to verify the suitability of the upgraded Soyuz-2.1a booster to launch astronauts and cosmonauts to the station and to check out a variety of Soyuz upgrades. The booster performed flawlessly and the Russians are expected to start using it for crewed missions starting early next year.\n\nThe two-day rendezvous also went smoothly until the final minutes of the approach. After carrying out additional tests, the Soyuz slewed about its long axis before briefly lining up on the Poisk module docking port. But instead of staying locked on, the nose drifted off in large arcs, almost as if the spacecraft was searching for a signal to home in on.\n\nOvchinin and Skvortsov were monitoring from the Zvezda module at the back end of the space station. Unlike unpiloted Progress supply ships, which have equipment on board that allows cosmonauts to take over manual control if problems develop, the normally crewed Soyuz relies on the vehicle commander if trouble develops.\n\n\"It's such a shame we were not able to use TORU,\" one of the cosmonauts said, referring to the backup control system. \"We would grab it and bring it in.\"\n\nWhile the Skybot robot strapped into the commander's seat of the Soyuz MS-14 spacecraft is being developed to carry out a variety of relatively complex tasks, piloting a Soyuz is far beyond its capabilities.", "description": "Russian flight controllers hope to make a second docking attempt after troubleshooting", "authors": ["William Harwood", "Bill Harwood Has Been Covering The U.S. Space Program Full-Time Since", "First As Cape Canaveral Bureau Chief For United Press International", "Now As A Consultant For Cbs News.
