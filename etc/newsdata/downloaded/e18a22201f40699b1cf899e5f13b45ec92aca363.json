Barrett, the No. 3 pick, and Reddish, taken 10th, were guarding each other at the start of the game.\n\n''Obviously, competing against him was a ton of fun,'' Reddish said. ''I mean, obviously in college we were together nonstop and we're here now, so competing against him was definitely a good experience.''\n\nWhile Williamson has been tearing up the NBA in preseason play to the tune of 23.3 points per game on 71.4% shooting for unbeaten New Orleans, Barrett and Reddish have experienced some of the usual rookie struggles.\n\nReddish entered shooting 28.6% at 6 for 21. He was 4 for 7 when the Hawks lost to the Pelicans in their opener, but then went 1 for 7 in each of the next two games, missing all eight 3-point attempts.\n\nHe bounced back with a 4-for-9 performance and nine points, which was good enough the way Trae Young (23 points, nine assists) and Vince Carter (17 points, five 3-pointers) played.\n\nBarrett averaged 16 points in his first two games and finished with 12 in this one. He did add seven rebounds and a team-high six assists, but his outside shot just wouldn't fall and his errant pass in the third quarter was scooped up by Reddish and taken for a three-point play that gave Atlanta a 75-69 lead.\n\nStory continues\n\n''He's always engaged. He's always trying to win,'' Knicks coach David Fizdale said about Barrett. ''These are good learning lessons for him right now to go through that and he still made some plays.''\n\nSPURS 128, ROCKETS 114\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge scored 22 points on 11-of-13 shooting to help visiting San Antonio get its first preseason win, and spoil James Harden's near triple-double.\n\nDejounte Murray added 20 points, going 8 of 11, for San Antonio (1-3), which shot 57% from the field. The Spurs, who led 65-51 at the half behind Murray's 15 points and Aldridge's 14, had six players score in double figures.\n\nHarden powered Houston (3-2) with 40 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. Russell Westbrook and Eric Gordon each added 14 points. Harden made 13 of 27 from the field and Westbrook was 5 of 13.\n\nHAWKS 100, KNICKS 96\n\nYoung beat the third-quarter buzzer with a long 3-pointer in transition to give Atlanta an 80-71 lead. Carter sank an open 3-pointer from the wing for a 97-95 lead with 1:30 remaining, and Young made two free throws at the 16-second mark to make it 99-96. New York was off on a 3-pointer and De'Andre Hunter sealed it with a free throw.\n\nHunter, a rookie from Virginia's national championship team, had 15 points for Atlanta (1-3). Carter scored 14 of Atlanta's 16 points with four 3-pointers late in the second quarter.\n\nJulius Randle paced New York (1-2) with 20 points and eight rebounds.\n\nPISTONS 116, HORNETS 110\n\nAndre Drummond and Markieff Morris each scored 17 points and visiting Detroit held off Charlotte. Drummond also had 15 rebounds, and Langston Galloway scored a team-high 18 points, with five 3-pointers, off the bench.\n\nTim Frazier added 15 points and 12 assists for Detroit (3-2), which was without Blake Griffin. Drummond had 12 points and nine rebounds in the first half as the Pistons led 61-58.\n\nMalik Monk led Charlotte (2-3) with 18 points and seven assists. Cody Zeller was one of four Hornets with 12 points.\n\nGRIZZLIES 124, THUNDER 119\n\nFormer Oregon standout Dillon Brooks scored 30 points, with five 3-pointers, and Jaren Jackson Jr. added 18 points and 10 rebounds for Memphis in the road victory.\n\nTyus Jones scored 10 of his 16 points in the first half for Memphis (3-1).\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 17 points, Danilo Gallinari had 16 points and 10 rebounds and Steven Adams added 12 points for Oklahoma City (2-2). Devon Hall scored a team-high 19.\n\nTRAIL BLAZERS 126, JAZZ 118\n\nAt Salt Lake City, CJ McCollum and Damian Lillard combined for 53 points and eight 3-pointers as Portland's backcourt outdueled Mike Conley Jr. and Donovan Mitchell.\n\nMcCollum made five 3s and scored 28 points, and Lillard had 25 points, five rebounds and four assists in 29 minutes.\n\nMitchell led Utah (1-4) with 27 points and four 3-pointers. Conley added 20 points and Rudy Gobert had 13 points and 15 boards.\n\nZach Collins was the only other starter for Portland (2-2) in double-figure scoring with 13 points.
