The Socialist People's Party abstained.\n\nAmong other things, the critics of the law questioned the fact that those affected would be notified electronically - potentially while they were in a conflict zone.\n\n'Not wanted in Denmark'\n\nBefore the legislation was passed, it was amended to allow for exemptions to the four-week period during which those affected could appeal the decision.\n\n\"It will ultimately be up to a judge to decide whether you can justify that you didn't respond before the deadline,\" Immigration and Integration Minister Mattias Tesfaye told broadcaster DR on Wednesday.\n\n191023073358905\n\nThe law was also amended to include a so-called \"sunset clause\", meaning it would expire in July 2021 unless Parliament decided otherwise.\n\n\"These people have turned their backs on Denmark and used violence to combat our democracy and freedom. They are not wanted in Denmark,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said last week.\n\nLast month, Denmark's justice minister said there were 36 people who had travelled from Denmark to fight in the Middle East.\n\nAmong them, 10 had their residency permits withdrawn and 12 have been jailed.\n\nIn March, under the previous government, Denmark adopted a law depriving children born abroad to Danish fighters the right to citizenship.", "description": "The law allows the government to revoke citizenship from dual-national Danes who have fought with ISIL.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/24/e0d7bef1abb94b8391b0425c0efbeed7_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
