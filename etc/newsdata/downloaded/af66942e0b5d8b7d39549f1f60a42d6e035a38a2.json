The family spoke with the BBC and said they hadn't received any additional messages from the woman after she texted them Tuesday that she was suffocating.\n\nThe family, who said they paid for their daughter to be smuggled into the United Kingdom, is one of possibly six Vietnamese families that fear a relative is among the dead, the BBC reported.\n\nMills also called on families who fear their loved ones are dead to speak with police.\n\n\"I can\u2019t begin to comprehend what some of you must be going through right now. You have my assurance that Essex Police will be working tirelessly to understand the whole picture to this absolute tragedy,\" Mills said.\n\nThe arrests come as police began moving the victims from the Port of Tilbury to a hospital in Chelmsford, where the first post-mortem examinations will begin Friday. Mills said police have closed the scene at the industrial park.\n\nInvestigators are still looking to determine a cause of death for the eight women and 31 men found dead in the truck.\n\n\"Formal identification will then follow the coronial process and will be a lengthy but crucial part of this investigation,\" Essex police said in a statement.\n\nAuthorities in multiple countries have been working together to track the circuitous routes that the truck cab and its trailer took to end up in the industrial site.\n\nPolice said Thursday they believe the truck cab, which is registered in Bulgaria and owned by an Irish company, came from Northern Ireland, through Ireland, over to Wales and ended up in England. The container where the bodies were found is believed to have traveled to the United Kingdom from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge.\n\nSOURCE maps4news.com/\u00a9HERE More\n\nGlobal Trailer Rentals Ltd. told Ireland\u2019s national broadcaster RTE the trailer it owns was leased Oct. 15 in County Monaghan, in Ireland, at a rate of $299 per week. The Dublin-based company said it will make the data from its tracking system available to investigators.\n\nThe grim incident had similarities to a 2000 case where 58 Chinese migrants suffocated in a truck in Dover, England, after a journey from China\u2019s southern Fujian province. The bodies were found in a cargo truck carrying tomatoes after a ferry ride from Zeebrugge, the same port in the current case.", "description": "Police made more arrests Friday in connection with the investigation into 39 bodies discovered in the back of a\u00a0truck outside London.", "authors": ["Ellis Whitehouse", "Basildon", "England"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/So7D_xERRampaI52OI_DsQ--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTU2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/e62b84bc9a7594362fb7ee7facd2db40", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
