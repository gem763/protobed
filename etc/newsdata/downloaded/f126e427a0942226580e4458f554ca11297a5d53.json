Academics and MPs described the figures, analysed by The Guardian, as \u201cshocking\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere will be elements of that about increased reporting and awareness but that is not going to account for such a big rise - there is something happening,\u201d Simon Harding, an associate professor of criminology at the University of West London, told the newspaper.\n\n\u201cWorking in county lines has a great allure for young people. It gives them a tax-free income, gives them a regular income and high income\u201d.\n\nThe Department for Education data showed a steady rise in the number of vulnerable children who go missing or become involved with gangs over the past few years.\n\nFactors for a child disappearing are complex but can also include the absence of social services in the area, along with the work of drugs gangs.\n\nJosie Allan, of Missing People UK, said: \u201cI did research recently with a small group of young people involved in county lines, and everyone who took part said that going missing was a key feature, especially in the early stages of criminal exploitation.\u201d\n\nAnother factor thought to be driving the trend of children being reported missing is a drop in the number of parents or teachers reporting them as \u201cabsent\u201d instead.\n\nAnn Coffey, the MP for Stockport and chair of the all-party Parliamentary committee on runaway and missing children and adults, told the newspaper: \u201cWhat concerns me is that we are not really making inroads on arresting and taking those senior gang leaders out of county lines. As long as they continue to operate, the number of children exploited will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nA Government spokesman said: \u201cAny child that goes missing from home, school or care could be in danger of exploitation from gangs or violent criminals \u2013 that\u2019s why we are equipping the professionals who protect vulnerable children to help them identify those who are most at risk and keep them safe.\n\n\u201cOur national \u2018tackling child exploitation\u2019 support programme is helping specialists in education, social care, health, the police and the voluntary sector to improve how they respond to these kinds of threats in their communities, including gangs, county lines drug activity and trafficking, and our serious violence strategy includes a range of actions to combat county lines.\u201d", "description": "County lines drug networks have been blamed for a huge spike in the number of children identified as having links to gangs, after the figure more than doubled in three years.
