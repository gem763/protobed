But the stories tumbling out this week show it\u2019s far from eradicated.\n\nPrompted by presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren\u2019s claim that she was forced out of a teaching job in 1971 because she was pregnant, scores of women have shared similar experiences on social media. Police officers, academics, fast food workers, lawyers, flight attendants, administrative assistants and others say they hid pregnancies on the job or during interviews, faced demeaning comments and were demoted or even fired after revealing a pregnancy.\n\nWhen some raised doubts about Warren\u2019s account \u2014 noting a 2007 interview in which she gave different reasons for leaving her job \u2014 women pushed back on Twitter and Facebook. Many say they accept Warren\u2019s explanation that she has grown more comfortable since 2007 sharing the real reason she resigned from the school was because the principal hired someone else once Warren became visibly pregnant.\n\n\u201cPregnancy discrimination is real, and I believe Elizabeth Warren,\u201d tweeted Dr. Diane Horvath, an obstetrician and gynecologist who works at Whole Woman\u2019s Health, a clinic in Baltimore.\n\nHorvath didn\u2019t even trust her own profession when she was interviewing for a family planning fellowship five years ago. She hid her pregnancy for 26 weeks during the application process, buying multiple suits to hide her growing belly.\n\n\u201cIt was just the worry that I was going to be seen as less reliable because I was a parent,\u201d Horvath told The Associated Press. \u201cThere\u2019s no good time to have a baby.\u201d\n\nHorvath noted that she was privileged. She knew she could fall back on her medical degree if she didn\u2019t get the fellowship. But many women aren\u2019t so lucky.\n\n\u201cThe stakes are so much higher if people can\u2019t get a job that will pay their rent and keep their kids from starving,\u201d she said.\n\nTitle VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination by employers on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. In 1978, it was amended to forbid discrimination based on pregnancy in any aspect of employment, including hiring, firing, pay and job assignments in companies with 15 or more employees.\n\nThe law is still evolving; on Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court was asked to decide if it also bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and transgender status.\n\nPregnant women have other protections on the job. Impairments from pregnancy, such as gestational diabetes, are considered disabilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, and employers may have to offer accommodations for them.\n\nBut complaints about harassment and other violations are common. There were 2,790 cases alleging pregnancy discrimination filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2018. That doesn\u2019t include cases filed with individual states, or cases that simply aren\u2019t filed because proving discrimination can be tricky. Employers may rescind a promised job, for example, without specifying why.\n\n\u201cEmployers have gotten much more discreet in acts of discrimination,\u201d said Craig Barkacs, a law professor at the University of San Diego School of Business who successfully prosecuted one of the first cases of pregnancy discrimination in the U.S. in 1992.\n\nBarkacs said the problem affects women broadly \u2014 even those who aren\u2019t pregnant.\n\n\u201cAt some psychological level, there\u2019s a paradigm of what an efficient workplace is,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen even potentially becoming pregnant disrupts that workflow.\u201d\n\nBarkacs thinks that\u2019s changing. More men and partners of pregnant women are taking parental leave, following high-profile examples like Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. That could make employers less likely to penalize pregnancy as a disruption, he said.\n\nMore comprehensive federal laws with tough sanctions would also help, he said. Some states require employers to provide unpaid leave and health care to women who are disabled by pregnancy, for example, but others don\u2019t.\n\nSonya Rosenberg, a partner with Neil, Gerber and Eisenberg law firm in Chicago who trains companies on employment-related legal issues, said employers often have a short-sighted approach to pregnant employees.\n\n\u201cPregnancy and childbirth take up a comparatively tiny amount of time in a woman\u2019s overall career span,\u201d she said. Companies that make accommodations for pregnant employees \u2014 and enforce those policies \u2014 will be more successful at retaining female talent.\n\nBut Horvath believes real change will only come when the U.S. adopts more comprehensive laws promoting parenthood, including paid leave and subsidized child care. Even with the current laws in place, she says, many pregnant women don\u2019t have the time, energy or money to pursue a discrimination case in court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never going to be written that you were fired for pregnancy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially unenforceable.\u201d", "description": "For 41 years, federal law has banned pregnancy discrimination in the workplace.
