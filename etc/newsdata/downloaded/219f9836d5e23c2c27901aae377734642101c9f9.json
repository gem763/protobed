The parents of what they thought was a perfectly healthy baby boy were in shock as paramedics worked to save their child\u2019s life. He was only 14 weeks old at the time.\n\n\"Words cannot begin to describe the pain we felt [at] that moment,\u201d Michael\u2019s mother, Emma Labuschagne, told South West News Service (SWNS), a British news agency.\n\nMOM CLAIMS EPIDURAL FAILED DURING EMERGENCY C-SECTION: 'IT WAS LIKE LIVING IN A NIGHTMARE'\n\n\"We watched our baby breathless, gasping for air while his heart stopped. [At] that moment I did not think Michael would make it through,\u201d she added.\n\nBut Michael survived.\n\nMichael, who then was diagnosed with a cardiac fibroma, was placed in a medically induced coma. When he woke, Emma, 27, said the first thing he did was smile at his father, Stuart. The infant was then fitted with a pacemaker.\n\n\u201cIt does hold him back. It's as big as the size of the palm of my hand and it has sharp edges,\u201d Emma said of the device. \"Putting that inside a baby is quite uncomfortable for them. But he is amazing, you wouldn't know [by] looking at him that he is fighting this.\u201d\n\nThe mother of three said she and her husband are raising money to bring their son to Boston Children\u2019s Hospital for surgery, which is expected to cost $147,000.\n\n\u201cThe cardiac surgeons at Boston are the best cardiac surgeons in the world and they have done this operation several times,\u201d said Emma. \"They are confident that they can drastically improve, or even cure, his condition by resecting the tumor. They want to operate within six months as his heart will be a good size.\u201d\n\nMost heart tumors are non-cancerous. But due to the sensitive location, \u201ceven benign tumors can be life-threatening,\u201d the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital states.\n\n\u201cA tumor can interfere with the way the heart works, blocking blood flow to vital organs and causing an abnormal heart rhythm,\u201d it adds.\n\nFibromas, the type of tumor on Michael\u2019s heart, is the second most common type of cardiac tumors in children. About 14 percent of pediatric heart tumors are fibromas, according to the hospital. These tumors are most often located in the heart\u2019s ventricles \u2014 namely and most commonly in the left one \u2014 and can obstruct blood flow to the heart, which can cause valvular malfunctions and ultimately lead to heart failure.\n\nDAD'S SKIN CANCER BATTLE LEAVES HIM WITH MASSIVE CHUNK MISSING FROM NECK, BACK\n\nFibromas \u201care often associated with arrhythmias and ventricular tachycardia,\u201d per the hospital.\n\nSurgery is often recommended to remove the tumor, but in some cases \u2014 especially for large or non-removable tumors \u2014 a heart transplant may be required, according to Science Direct.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"He's a lovely little baby \u2014 it's hard to believe he's going through what he is. He's a miracle,\u201d Emma said.
