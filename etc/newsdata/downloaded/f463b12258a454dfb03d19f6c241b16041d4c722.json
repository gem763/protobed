(Al Drago/Reuters)\n\nThe House Democrats leading the impeachment probe into President Trump issued subpoenas Thursday to two associates of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, after the men were arrested earlier in the day on campaign-finance charges.\n\nThe chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform Committees subpoenaed Florida businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who are from the former Soviet Union, for documents and information they may have relevant to the impeachment inquiry. Giuliani previously said he had worked with the two in his push for Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\n\u201cYour clients are private citizens who are not employees of the Executive Branch,\u201d the chairmen wrote to attorney John Dowd, who previously served as Trump\u2019s personal attorney and now represents Parnas and Fruman. \u201cThey may not evade requests from Congress for documents and information necessary to conduct our inquiry. They are required by law to comply with the enclosed subpoenas.\u201d\n\nThe chairmen also took a shot at Trump, saying that others will not be allowed to follow his example of obstructing Congress.\n\n\u201c[Parnas and Fruman] are not exempted from this requirement merely because they happen to work with Mr. Giuliani, and they may not defy congressional subpoenas merely because President Trump has chosen the path of denial, defiance, and obstruction,\u201d they wrote, adding that the deadline for the men to turn over the requested information was October 16.\n\nThe House subpoenas come after a week in which the White House has signaled that it has no intention of cooperating with the probe.\n\n\u201cBecause participating in this inquiry under the current unconstitutional posture would inflict lasting institutional harm on the Executive Branch and lasting damage to the separation of powers, you have left the President no choice,\u201d White House lawyer Pat Cipollone wrote in a letter to House Democrats on Tuesday.", "description": "House Democrats issued subpoenas Thursday to two associates of Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, after the men were arrested earlier.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "A.
