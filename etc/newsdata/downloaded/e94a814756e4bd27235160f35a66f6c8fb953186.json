Together, the data suggest that even growth below the national rate could be enough to satisfy many voters that Mr. Trump has fulfilled his promises.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a big uptick\u201d in the economy, said Anthony Seiwell, a Pennsylvania official with the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America. \u201cIt\u2019s not much different than it was five years ago.\u201d The political impact: \u201cTrump supporters are still Trump supporters.\u201d\n\nThe Journal used data from the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan public policy research organization, to look at the economy in 77 blue-collar and manufacturing-reliant counties across the Midwest and Northeast. These counties, as a group, tilted only slightly toward the GOP in 2012 but then swung heavily behind Mr. Trump in 2016, backing him by a margin of 13 percentage points.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s big vote totals in some of these counties were crucial to his victories in previously Democratic Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Macomb County, outside Detroit, gave Mr. Trump a winning margin of 48,000 votes, four times the number he needed to carry Michigan. Mr. Trump won Westmoreland County, outside Pittsburgh, by 57,000 votes, more than his winning margin in Pennsylvania statewide.\n\nMr. Trump visited many of these counties as a candidate, promising an economic rebound.\n\nIn Michigan\u2019s Macomb county, unemployment is lower than it was in mid-2016 but some General Motors plants have closed.

National average Blue Collar suburbs 0 20 40 60 80 White, non-Hispanic 60% 81% Manufacturing jobs 10 16 Change in prime-age workers -8 1 Bachelor's degree 26 31\n\nJob growth in these counties was 1% in June from a year earlier, a touch below the national average of 1.1%. Still, a broader economic slowdown and strains in manufacturing associated with U.S. trade confrontations threaten to undermine the more recent gains, given the reliance on manufacturing jobs in these counties.\n\nReviewing other measures of economic dynamism, the analysis found that population growth in the 77 blue-collar counties has been stagnant, and that large numbers of working-age people have left, suggesting that the average age is rising. The total population rose by 0.1% annually from 2016 to 2018, the data show, below the annual national growth rate of 0.6%.\n\nThe number of business establishments grew by 0.6% annually in the blue-collar counties from 2016 to 2018, a faster pace than in the prior four years, but below the national rate of 1.8% growth.\n\n\u201cSlow but steady job growth in blue-collar counties is real and meaningful, but insufficiently strong to counter the relative economic decline of these places nationally,\u201d said Kenan Fikri, EIG\u2019s director of research.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s job-approval rating in the blue-collar counties rose during his first two years in office. Some 49% of people approved of his job performance in 2019, Wall Street Journal/NBC News surveys found. That was steady from 2018 and up from 44% in 2017.\n\nGeneral Motors recently closed its Warren Transmission Operations plant in Warren, Mich.

Recent polling finds that Mr. Trump\u2019s job-approval rating is at or below 45% in Wisconsin and Michigan, and is below 40% in Pennsylvania, with majorities holding a negative view of his job performance.\n\nBut others say growth has been steady enough to keep Trump supporters in the fold.\n\nIn Luzerne County, Pa., a former coal-mining center, even some Democrats said it was unlikely that Trump voters would defect. \u201cIf people who voted for him have had a change of heart, they\u2019re not disclosing it,\u201d said Jane Walsh Waitkus, a Democrat and member of the Luzerne County Council.\n\nLuzerne has benefited from growth in warehouse and distribution centers in recent years. Still, the area shows signs of struggling in recent months. Employment in the Scranton, Wilkes-Barre area was down 1.1% in July from a year earlier, according to Labor Department statistics.\n\nAt Dukey\u2019s Cafe, a neighborhood bar in Wilkes-Barre, J.J. Vassello said over a beer that at age 43 he was ready to leave the ranks of nonvoters and cast a ballot for Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Vassello, who works on heating and air-conditioning systems, said the economy was strong, and he liked Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies, among other things.\n\n\u201cI like the way he\u2019s handling things,\u201d he said. \u201cI think someone of his nature had to be put in his position\u2014it gave the U.S. a little twist\u2026an unconventional twist.\u201d\n\nIn some of the blue-collar counties, unemployment is down but economic anxiety remains. At 4.4% in June, the jobless rate in Macomb County, Mich., has fallen from 5.3% in June 2016, but is higher than the 4.0% of June 2017.\n\nMaria Nuculaj says she is reconsidering her vote for Mr. Trump after General Motors Co. recently closed a transmission plant across the street from the bar she owns, as well as an assembly plant in nearby Hamtramck.\n\n\u201cThis is the Motor City. We make cars. Now the people making the cars can\u2019t afford the cars,\u201d said Ms. Nuculaj, owner of the Motor City Sports Bar & Grill in Warren.\n\nShe added: \u201cI voted for Trump because I was hoping for better, hoping for more jobs to stay here. \u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll vote for him again.\u201d\n\nThe 77 counties in the EIG and Journal analysis were identified by the American Communities Project, a geography-analysis project based at George Washington University, for their common characteristics. These counties are just below the national average for household income and college education rates, and they have a larger share of manufacturing jobs than the nation as a whole.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How important will the economy be to President Trump\u2019s re-election chances? Join the conversation below.\n\nDemocrats say they don\u2019t expect to win a majority in the blue-collar counties, and in many cases they don\u2019t need to.\n\nMike Brewer, former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said his party doesn\u2019t need to regain all the votes it has lost in Macomb County, for example, which backed Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012.\n\n\u201cThey can lose the county and still win the state,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t lose it by tens of thousands of votes.\u201d\n\nAt the Motor City Sports Bar & Grill in Warren, Mich., owner Maria Nuculaj said she voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 in the hopes that more jobs would stay in the area.
