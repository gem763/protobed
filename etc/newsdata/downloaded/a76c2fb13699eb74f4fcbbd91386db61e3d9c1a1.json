But it's Lincoln's new SUVs that are luring customers to showrooms and helping to turn around the once-struggling carmaker.\n\nOver the last decade Lincoln, the luxury arm of Ford Motor Co., lost market share to German competitors that prioritized sport-utility vehicles and performance over large sedans. Now, the radical decision to go all-in on SUVs has paid off: Lincoln's Nautilus and Navigator utes are in high demand, and third-quarter sales rose nearly 12 percent from a year ago with the roll out of the high-profile Aviator SUV.\n\nLincoln Motor Co.\n\n\"Before, Lincolns were basically re-badged Fords,\" Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at AutoTrader, told ABC News. \"Lincoln now is trying to carve out its own path by looking for luxury buyers who want a lush interior over driving dynamics and speed. It's setting itself apart from Ford.\"\n\nAccording to Krebs, Lincoln underestimated the demand for the Navigator, Lincoln's full-size SUV that starts at $73,205 and can easily top $100,000 with the Black Label trim. The three-row, mid-sized Aviator, which has garnered strong reviews for its smooth handling, striking exterior styling and plush interior, will likely steal sales from BMW's X7 and Audi\u2019s Q7. Lincoln's latest SUV offering, the compact Corsair, targets customers who do not want to spend more than $40,000 on a vehicle.\n\nLincoln Motor Co.\n\nLincoln Motor Co.\n\n\"Lincoln's on a very good path,\" Krebs noted. \"There's not a lot of variation with SUVs. There seems to be a certain formula everyone is doing. But luxury buyers want to be pampered and Lincoln is focusing more on concierge service.\"\n\nIn September, the company introduced its Lincoln Access Rewards loyalty program that allows customers to earn redeemable points toward future vehicles, dealer services and personalized experiences. Lincoln\u2019s existing Pickup and Delivery service includes valets who will collect a customer\u2019s vehicle at an agreed-upon location and drop it off at a dealer for maintenance appointments. A complimentary loaner Lincoln is provided to the customer.\n\nSharon Carty, editor-in-chief of Car and Driver magazine, said she was impressed with the Aviator, calling the SUV a \u201chome run\u201d for Lincoln.\n\n\u201cIt feels like American luxury,\u201d she told ABC News. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get a lot of attention.\u201d\n\nLincoln Motor Co.\n\nThe Aviator\u2019s pricing \u2013 $51,500 for the standard Aviator (400 horsepower and 400 lb.-ft of torque from a twin-turbo V6 engine) and $68,800 for the hybrid Grand Touring variant (450 hp, 600 lb.-ft of torque) \u2013 could make it difficult for young drivers to afford, she argued.\n\n\u201cLincoln needs to embrace who they are,\u201d Carty said. \u201cThey make high-quality, luxury SUVs that appeal to older people. It's an older person's brand and maybe that's OK.\u201d\n\nDavid Placek, president of Lexicon Branding, a marketing firm based in northern California, said Lincoln\u2019s hip, contemporary vehicles have wider appeal than years before. Will that be enough, however, to boost sales over the long run?\n\n\"The company needs to build a brand for the future instead of just going after millennials,\" he told ABC News.\n\nLincoln Motor Co.\n\nThe Aviator\u2019s roominess, versatility and sexiness are exactly what millennials \u2013 and traditional customers \u2013 are seeking in an SUV, Kemal Curic, Lincoln\u2019s head of design, told ABC News.\n\n\u201cAmericans are spending more time in their vehicles now,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThe Aviator is the ultimate expression of our Quiet Flight. We don\u2019t want the technology to overwhelm you. It\u2019s a sanctuary.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe\u2019ve created this rolling, beautiful art on wheels. It\u2019s important to have a timeless appeal.\u201d", "description": "Lincoln's new SUVs are luring customers to showrooms and helping to turn around the once-struggling carmaker.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/_V9I0744-ht-ml-191004_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
