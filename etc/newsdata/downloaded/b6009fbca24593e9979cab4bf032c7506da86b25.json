It said in a statement: \"Little seems to change and we\u2019re barely scratching the surface of the cuts we need to make.\n\n\"Manchester airport is still expanding, and millions are still being invested in major road developments that will increase car journeys, such as Great Ancoats Street.\"\n\nBut Manchester City Council\u2019s deputy leader said representatives \u201crecognise the urgency of climate change\u201d and \u201care determined to be in the forefront of tackling\u201d the issue.\n\nCllr Nigel Murphy said: \u201cWe have set a target of making Manchester a zero carbon city by 2038 or earlier \u2013 at least 12 years ahead of the national target.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Seeking refuge from the noise of the crowds in a House of Frasers just after 5pm, he described the mood as he saw it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very busy and extremely good natured,\u201d Mr Cossham said. \u201dThere are a lot of people saying that individual action is important but the government need to act. They can\u2019t understand why the government is focusing on the trivia of Brexit when the world is burning. There\u2019s a lot of people very very worried, I\u2019ve seen people welling up.\n\nBut not everyone welcomed the influx of protesters.\n\n\u201cI agree with your message, but blocking MCR won\u2019t work,\u201d one person wrote on Twitter. \u201cNot many people drive into Manchester. You will stop buses which brings ordinary low paid shop and office workers into town. They already struggle to make ends meet. They won\u2019t be paid if they can\u2019t get to work\u201d.\n\nLabour councillor Pat Karney told the Manchester Evening News: \u201cEverybody will be signed up to the objectives about climate change, everyone can see the weather, everyone knows we\u2019ve got problems, but whether this is the best way of bringing it to the government\u2019s attention and to large corporations attention, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d\n\n\u201cI think what people will see here, if people stay here for four days, public opinion will turn radically against them.\u201d\n\nAt 6pm, Greater Manchester Police said the few complaints they had received had already been addressed. Nobody had so far been arrested.\n\nAnother group of about 50 protesters appeared at City of London Magistrate\u2019s Court for the third Friday running, after the Crown Prosecution Service decided to charge all of the 1,130 people arrested during April\u2019s \u201cSpring Uprising\u201d in the capital.\n\nThe 10-day protest, which saw traffic supplanted by demonstrations, speaking events and greenery in key locations across the capital, led Westminster to declare a climate emergency.\n\nActivists have criticised the decision to fill the courts with such cases, and accused the government of being \u201cdesperate to stifle dissent and obfuscate the truth of its failure to protect the wellbeing of the future of this nation and its inhabitants\u201d.", "description": "Extinction Rebellion\u00a0(XR) protesters began a planned\u00a0four-day occupation of Manchester on Friday, saying that despite councils in the metropolis declaring a climate emergency, \u201clittle seems to change\u201d.
