Thus, residents can park their cars at companies' parking areas at night, while during the daytime, company employees can use some parking spaces in the residential communities.\n\nTo ease residents' parking difficulties, the local authority delivered a device that can record the time a parking area is occupied to each local resident. They can pay their parking fee through the device, which is much lower than citizens from other areas of the city.", "description": "Beijing's Xicheng district government has carried out new measures via innovation to cope with parking difficulties in its communities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/24/5db168a2a310cf3e97a2cf99.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
