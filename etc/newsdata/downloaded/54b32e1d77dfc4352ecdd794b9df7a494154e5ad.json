Last August, it was announced that Disney+ will be unveiled this fall, featuring a wide range of Disney programming including new shows and Disney\u2019s vast library.\n\nThere doesn\u2019t appear to be any love lost between these two competitors.\n\nIt is certainly a sign of the times. Disney is willing to forego some rather sizable revenue to gain an edge for their fledgling streaming service which is in direct competition with the likes of Netflix as well Amazon Prime and new streaming services offered by HBO, Apple and NBC.\n\nIn 2018, Netflix spent over $1.8 billion on advertising, more than double what they spent two years ago. The Journal reports that \u201cNetflix spent $99.2 million on U.S. TV ads during 2018, with some 13% going to Disney-owned entertainment networks.\u201d\n\nRich Greenfield, a partner and LightShed and a media analyst, doesn\u2019t think that Disney\u2019s decision to ban advertising from Netflix does too much to hurt the streaming giants.\n\n\u201cTo me, I think at the end of the day, Netflix not being able to advertise on Disney hurts Disney more than it does Netflix,\u201d Greenfield told FOX Business.\n\n\u201cI just think that the competition between all of these companies is becoming more intense. This is another sign of the increasing competition between all these platforms.\u201d\n\nNow with Disney in direct competition with streaming giant Netflix, the decision has been made to draw a line in the sand. That\u2019s some \u201cHakuna matata\u201d right there but recently, there has been some friction between Disney and their competitors in the burgeoning streaming market.\n\nDisney CEO Robert Iger announced his resignation from Apple\u2019s board in September. Apple TV Plus will also launch in November, just days before Disney\u2019s streaming option goes live.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Disney, which has a streaming service coming out this fall, is banning all Netflix advertising on their platforms.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/2017-04-18T175705Z_1_LYNXMPED3H13E_3_NETFLIX-RESULTS-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
