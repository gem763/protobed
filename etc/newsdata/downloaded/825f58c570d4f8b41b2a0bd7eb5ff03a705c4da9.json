The ECB also cut its main deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.5%, a record low but in line with market expectations.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan and Bank of England will all conclude their respective policy meetings next week.\n\nOn the data front, retail sales for August and import prices for August will be released at around 8:30 a.m. ET. Consumer sentiment for September and business inventories for July will follow slightly later in the session.\n\nThere are no Treasury auctions scheduled for Friday.", "description": "U.S. government debt yields were mixed Friday morning as traders monitored developments in the U.S.-China trade war and digested the European Central Bank's (ECB) latest policy action.", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103179656-GettyImages-110126160.jpg?v=1516349856", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
