Was that a genius move? | Cas Mudde", "language": "en", "text": "And there it was, practically out of the blue, at a press conference, Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney by and large admitted that President Trump held back military aid to force Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden. Asked whether the administration had told Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky that funding would not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happened as well, Mulvaney said: \u201cWe do \u2014 we do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d\n\nAn admission of the quid pro quo deal that President Trump has been denying so vigorously for the past weeks. And although Mulvaney seemed to be walking back his admission only a few hours later, this could be the new impeachment counter-strategy of the increasingly embattled White House. And it would be a good one too.\n\nMost importantly, because it fits the \u201cLet Trump Be Trump\u201d strategy that the president\u2019s boosters have been pushing since the beginning \u2013 against the more cautious and worried Republican establishment. When pushed by the journalist, Mulvaney didn\u2019t back down but double down. \u201cAnd I have news for everybody\u201d, he said. \u201cGet over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThis is exactly what Trump and the Republican base wants to hear. It plays to all his greatest hits. First and foremost, it has Trump back on the offensive, rather than the defensive. What all Republicans admire, even the ones \u201cupset\u201d by his vulgar behavior and tweets, is his open confrontations with \u201cthe liberal establishment.\u201d Trump is the only Republican politician that is able to \u201cown the libs\u201d and that pays big dividends among a population that has convinced itself that they are the biggest victims of liberal political correctness.\n\nThis strategy plays to Trump as the taboo-breaker. Yes, I did it, and I don\u2019t care. I am not like you, professional politicians, the swamp. And third, it speaks to his \u201cmasculine\u201d leadership style, bold and risky, in sharp contrast to the \u201ceffeminate\u201d approach of Democrats and Republicans In Name Only (Rinos).\n\nBut it also completely changes the importance of the impeachment procedure in the House. When the House Committee will find evidence for the quid pro quo deal, which seems near certain at this point, many people, and particularly most Republicans, will respond much more blas\u00e9. \u201cWe already knew that.\u201d It raises the bar for the committee to come up with something \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cshocking\u201d.\n\nAnd it also forces Republican lawmakers to take sides already now, when the dirty details and prodding proof of the deal are not yet known. It is much harder for Republicans to \u201cbetray\u201d their president now than after the House Committee comes with \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cshocking\u201d evidence. In fact, various Republicans were already working the Fox programs to minimize the importance of a possible quid pro quo deal, arguing that the withholding of military aid was also in the best interest of the US military.\n\nFinally, Mulvaney\u2019s \u201cslip of the tongue\u201d admission was perfectly timed. He said it only a few hours after Vice President Mike Pence had announced \u201ca truce\u201d with Turkey, in the bloody Turkish attacks of Kurdish-dominated Northern Syria, at least temporarily stemming the outspoken dissent of the hawkish faction of the Republican Party. And a day after the alleged \u201cPelosi Meltdown\u201d, which conservatives are spinning as evidence of the lack of respect for and willingness to collaborate with President Trump. They now have several weeks to convince their base that the quid pro quo deal, which will sound more \u201cnormal\u201d with every day that goes by, is nothing special and just one of the many \u201cfake scandals\u201d that the Democrats try to use to remove a president they never gave a chance.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. There is no guarantee that this will work. Who knows what the House Committees will come up with in the coming weeks. God knows that there is more than enough to uncover. But at the very least it has Trump back in control of the Republican narrative. Looking strong and still supported by the vast majority of Republicans, who keep opposing impeachment. It has raised the bar for Republicans to turn against their president and for Democrats to shock the nation.
