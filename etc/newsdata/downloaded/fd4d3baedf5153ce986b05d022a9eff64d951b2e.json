Here's why he thinks 'all market participants need to worry.'", "language": "en", "text": "Ray Dalio, the founder and cochief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates \u2014 the largest hedge fund \u2014 expressed his worry over the Trump administration's new plan to curb US investment in China.\n\nThe hedge-fund mogul likened this latest development to a period between 1935 and 1945, when a similar scenario resulted in the use of emergency powers and then, eventually, disaster.\n\nDalio thinks all market participants need to be concerned if today's advancements follow a similar path.\n\nClick here for more BI Prime stories.\n\nThe Trump administration's latest trade-war escalation involving China is focused on limiting US investors' capital flows into the emerging nation.\n\nPossible courses of action include: the delisting of Chinese companies from US stock exchanges, restricting US investors' exposure to Chinese investment through government pensions, and placing limits on Chinese companies included in indexes managed by the US.\n\nThis week, Ray Dalio \u2014 the founder and cochief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates \u2014 weighed in on the discussion by offering historical anecdotes, potential next steps, and reasons why this development shouldn't be taken lightly.\n\n\"Regarding the capital and currency wars, the ability of the US president to unilaterally cut off capital flows to China and also freeze payments on the debts owed to China and also use sanctions to inhibit non-American financial transactions with China must be considered as possibilities,\" Dalio said in a recent LinkedIn post.\n\nHe continued: \"That's why the proposed step of limiting American portfolio investments in China makes me both think about the implications of this step and wonder if it is an inching toward bigger moves.\"\n\nRead more: The last 2 times stocks entered the 'Grey Zone' were before the tech bubble and the global financial crisis. Here's why UBS thinks equities are on a similar path \u2014 and why the Fed will be powerless to stop it.\n\nTo that end, Dalio thinks that President Donald Trump may lean on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to further restrict the Chinese economy.\n\nThis act \"empowers the president to unilaterally impose capital and FX controls, freeze assets and/or payments on assets (coupons), and force asset divestitures to 'deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat' from outside the US to 'the national security\u2026economy of the United States,'\" he said.\n\nParallels to the period from 1935 to 1945\n\nTo provide historical context for his argument, Dalio referenced a similar scenario that occurred in the late 1930's between the US and Japan. During this time period, the US froze Japanese assets and embargoed oil to Japan. The conflict eventually spiraled out of control.\n\nReferencing this contested period from 1935 to 1945, Dalio thinks these most recent developments are akin to \"the most logical steps in this classic dangerous journey.\"\n\nBurgeoning wealth and political gaps, central banks' limited ability to stimulate, and a new world power on the rise were all present throughout the late '30s and early '40s.\n\nToday, we're in that same spot. Income inequality and political extremes are present and growing, the Federal Reserve is running out of tools to stimulate the economy, and China is starting to challenge the US's status as the de facto world power.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, it's easy to see why Dalio is worried about this latest development and how deepening escalations could lead to a disaster.\n\n\"In any case, from not having to worry about such things in the past, now all market participants need to worry about them,\" he concluded.", "description": "The billionaire investor thinks the Trump administration's latest trade-war escalation is developing into \"a classic dangerous journey.\"", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d94a6608bd8ec041d7381a9?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
