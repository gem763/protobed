She went on to refute Trump's assertion that al-Baghdadi, whom he called a dog, was also a coward.\n\n\"He may have died a coward @realDonaldTrump but ALL living things suffer when they are blown up,\" the \"Halloween\u201c star tweeted. \"Anyone who has experienced warfare, unlike yourself, would know that.

Trump could not possibly have heard \"whimpering and crying\" on the overhead imagery because there was no audio,\" Boot wrote in an opinion piece. \"The assertion that Baghdadi died as a coward was, in any case, contradicted by the fact that rather than be captured, he blew himself up.\"\n\nBoot later noted in a tweet that his \"coward\" insight was later removed from the piece because \"it wrongly conveyed the impression that I considered Baghdadi courageous. As I wrote Sun: Baghdadi was 'a sick and depraved man.'\"", "description": "Actress Jamie Lee Curtis blasted President Trump after he called the dead\u00a0ISIS leader\u00a0Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi a dog, telling the president that dogs are \"brave,\u00a0bold, loyal, loving and healing.\"", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
