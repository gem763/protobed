Pompeo defended Trump\u2019s planned talks, saying the presidential retreat in Maryland was an \u201cappropriate place,\u201d given that it had been the venue for Mideast peace negotiations and other diplomatic meetings.\n\nTrump tweeted Saturday night that he canceled negotiations with the Taliban in the wake of Thursday\u2019s car bombing that killed an American soldier, a Romanian service member and 10 civilians in a busy diplomatic area near the U.S. Embassy in the Afghan capital. The bombing was one of many attacks by the Taliban in recent days. Sgt. 1st Class Elis A. Barreto Ortiz, 34, was the fourth U.S. service member killed in the past two weeks in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThey tried to use terror to improve their negotiating position,\u201d said Pompeo, who appeared on five Sunday TV talk shows. \u201cThe Taliban overreached.\u201d\n\nPompeo said the agreement in principle that had been negotiated with the Taliban included their commitment to break with al-Qaida. The Taliban harbored al-Qaida before that group conducted the 9/11 attacks against the United States.\n\n\u201cAnd then the Taliban failed to live up to a series of commitments that they had made, and when that happened President Trump said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to take that deal. I\u2019m not going to work with someone that can\u2019t deliver on their commitments,\u2019\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nThe Afghan government says it doesn\u2019t believe talks between the United States and Taliban will continue \u201cat this stage.\u201d Taliban said Americans would be the ones who suffer from Trump\u2019s cancellation of the talks.\n\nAfghan presidential spokesman Sediq Sediqqi confirmed that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had wanted to go to Washington to speak with Trump about his concerns \u201cbut I am not able to go into the details of the particular trip.\u201d The details of the U.S.-Taliban deal that had been shown to Ghani last week \u201cwere not convincing,\u201d Sediqqi said. \u201cLet\u2019s see the future.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban said canceling the talks damages \u201cthe credibility\u201d of the U.S., but that they think the U.S. will return to the negotiations.\n\n\u201cBoth sides were preparing for the announcement and signing of the agreement,\u201d the insurgent group said in a statement, saying they had been invited to the United States in late August but wanted to wait until the deal was ready to be signed. Now, \u201cwe will continue the ongoing jihad (against foreign occupation) and we firmly believe in the ultimate victory.\u201d\n\nPompeo said he hopes that\u2019s not the case and that the Taliban will recommit to the issues being negotiated.\n\n\u201cCooler heads, I hope, will prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the Taliban.\u201d\n\nCriticism of the Camp David outreach came from even Trump supporters.\n\n\u201cCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in a tweet. \u201cNo member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.\u201d\n\nGOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, a veteran, also voiced dismay: \u201cNever should leaders of a terrorist organization that hasn\u2019t renounced 9/11 and continues in evil be allowed in our great country. NEVER. Full stop,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Afghan government, sidelined from the negotiations, said it has \u201calways said that a real peace will come when the Taliban stop killing Afghans and implement a cease-fire and start direct negotiations with the Afghan government\u201d on the country\u2019s future \u2014 talks that were meant to quickly follow a U.S.-Taliban deal.\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s new statement said those talks had been meant to start on Sept. 23, five days before Afghanistan\u2019s presidential election.\n\nPompeo acknowledged that the attack was not the first since the talks began and said the U.S. has been attacking the Taliban too. Pompeo said more than 1,000 Taliban have been killed in battle during the past 10 days alone, but he didn\u2019t elaborate so it was unclear whether they were killed by American airstrikes or by the Afghan security forces, which have been on the front lines since the U.S. ended its combat mission in 2014. The American forces now are training, advising and assisting the Afghan fighters.\n\nTrump\u2019s move puzzled observers, who pointed out that both the Taliban and U.S. and Afghan forces have increased fighting in recent months to strengthen their position in the talks. Civilians have suffered more than anyone in what was the world\u2019s deadliest war in 2018.\n\nCanceling the talks also goes against Trump\u2019s pledge to withdraw the remaining 13,000 to 14,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan and end U.S. involvement in a conflict.\n\nKhalilzad said less than a week ago that a deal had been reached \u201cin principle\u201d with the group and that it only needed Trump\u2019s approval. The president, however, came under increased pressure from the Afghan government and some U.S. lawmakers who mistrust the Taliban and think it\u2019s too early to withdraw American forces.\n\n\u201cUnbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u201cThey were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people. I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position? They didn\u2019t, they only made it worse!\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cIf they cannot agree to a cease-fire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight?\u201d", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that Taliban \u201coverreached\u201d with a car bomb attack in Kabul that killed an American soldier, leading President...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ884_pompeo_ZG_20190908162633.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
