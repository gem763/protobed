Reuters\n\nOfficials first started investigating the source of the vast oil spill \u2014 reportedly the largest in Brazil's history \u2014 in September. Since then, public outrage has grown following President Jair Bolsonaro's failure to contain the crisis.\n\nIt's been close to two months since the spill was first detected, but the source remains a mystery. Officials have no idea if the amount of oil is increasing or decreasing \u2014 or how long the issue will last.\n\nExperts told BBC News the spill could be the worst-ever disaster for coral reefs in the region. Crude has washed up on more than 1,300 miles of beaches in nine states \u2014 affecting the rich landscape and diverse marine life. At least 15 sea turtles, two seabirds and one fish have been found dead, according to officials.\n\nA boy walks out of the sea while removing oil spilled on Itapuama beach located in the city of Cabo de Santo Agostinho, Pernambuco state, Brazil, on October 21, 2019.

Environmentalists said humans were the root cause of those devastating fires \u2014 many were deliberately set to clear the forest for large-scale agriculture, though wind and heat helped them spread.\n\nAt the time, Bolsonaro called the global alarm \"sensationalist\" and warned foreign governments not to meddle in the territory, which generated even harsher critique, both locally and at home.\n\nAn analysis by Ibama, the country's environmental agency, showed the oil did not come from Brazil. Investigations into the source of the contamination are ongoing.\n\n\"The most we can do today is have trained people to collect this oil that is reaching our beaches,\" Mour\u00e3o said.", "description": "Brazilians have been critical of the government's response \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to the environmental crisis", "authors": ["Sophie Lewis"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/23/1277914b-bb9c-4e2a-9b87-1c0928cf2788/thumbnail/1200x630/77eef56bafa7a7ea3477e39f0b31a55c/109300066-41fb18b3-2314-4b16-8c3e-6560a87a85cd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
