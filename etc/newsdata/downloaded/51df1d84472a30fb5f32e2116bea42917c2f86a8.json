Yet, the firm wouldn\u2019t reveal estimates on what interest rates would be.\n\nRelated: Genesis Trading Acquires Quant Investment Firm Qu Capital\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to offer more details on interest yields when we have an actual result,\u201d Kline said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see some groups offer up to 8 to 12 percent interest. They often have asterisks next to those numbers \u2026 those rates are more in the 2 to 3 to 4 percent range. You\u2019ll see someone deploy a 12 percent rate on bitcoin for three days.\u201d\n\nBitcoin IRA chose Genesis because of the lending firm\u2019s track record for being able to take on new clients.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin IRA has processed more than $350 million in investments for more than 4,000 clients. Genesis has so far lent out a cumulative $2.3 billion in cryptocurrency and cash.\n\nThe product expansion is a deepening of Genesis\u2019 relationship with Bitcoin IRA, which was already using Genesis\u2019 over-the-counter trading desk.\n\n\u201cThey are the largest digital IRA provider that we are aware of, and I think that we always want to be working with the leaders in the space,\u201d Martin Garcia, co-head of sales and trading at Genesis, told CoinDesk.\n\nMoving forward, despite legal battle\n\nBitcoin IRA\u2019s partnership with Genesis comes despite the fact that the pension plan provider is embroiled in a lawsuit with Kingdom Trust, a Kentucky-based trust custodian that supported its product in 2016.\n\nKingdom claims that Bitcoin IRA has been using deceptive practices to get customers to switch from Kingdom Trust to BitGo, a qualified custodian with which Bitcoin IRA partnered in June.\n\nJason Anderson, president of Kingdom Trust, told CoinDesk:\n\n\u201cClients have been surprised to find that their account is being transferred to a new custodian. In a lot of cases clients have chosen to reverse that decision.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, a Kentucky federal judge dismissed Kingdom\u2019s claims with prejudice, and Bitcoin IRA has filed a motion that the claims should proceed in South Dakota, where it filed its countersuit.\n\nDespite the suit, Bitcoin IRA hasn\u2019t stopped releasing products. In early September, the firm announced facial recognition for authentication of transactions. Later last month, it announced crypto swaps from bitcoin into ether without delays in settlement.\n\nBy next year, the firm aims to make its accounts open to a wider customer base by removing it\u2019s $3,000 account minimum and replacing it with an automatic minimum monthly savings increment. While the firm doesn\u2019t have a set estimate yet, Kline said that $50 a month might be a \u201crealistic estimate.\u201d\n\nKline said:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our biggest rollout. It will be designed so that everyone has access to retirement savings for cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock\n\nRelated Stories", "description": "The digital asset IRA company will offer interest on cryptocurrency and cash holdings that customers want to lend out.", "authors": ["Nathan Dicamillo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zcE083NPfmN4pZKzNAQfwg--~B/aD0zNTU7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/4f592e1e9698f05a1ecfe36bf61768e0", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
