We have to stop doing it.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, May told CBC News she wouldn't prop up a minority government that moves forward with the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.\n\nIf the Green Party wins enough seats, May said they could hold \"the balance of responsibility\" to tell the bigger parties \"we won't let you get past the very first confidence vote, unless we see absolute evidence, a change in our target, a commitment to real action.\"\n\nShe stressed that her party is more interested in securing a sustainable future for the planet than advancing its own political power.\n\n\"How could we ever vote confidence in a government that's working against our children's interests?\" she said.\n\n\"The goal here isn't to come up with something politically palatable, it's to do the right thing.\"\n\nIf elected, she said the party wouldn't stop upgrades to other existing facilities that have already been approved, but that \"we don't need a single additional inch of fossil fuel infrastructure.\"\n\nSteel pipe to be used in the oil pipeline construction of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project sits on rail cars at a stockpile site in Kamloops, B.C.
