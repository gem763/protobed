The company also is granting its underwriters the option to buy an additional 2.9 million shares.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, the company recorded revenue of $2.05 billion, up from $1.5 billion in the comparable period last year, according to the filing. Endeavor said the increase was driven by a 46.4% growth in revenue in its entertainment and sports segment.\n\nThe company\u2019s entertainment and sports division, which negotiates media-distribution deals on behalf of more than 150 clients including the International Olympic Committee and National Football League, is Endeavor\u2019s biggest source of revenue.\n\nThe company recorded a loss of $192.6 million for the first half of the year, narrower than last year\u2019s $404.5 million. Its operating expenses for the first half of the year grew to $2.04 billion from $1.63 billion.\n\nEndeavor first filed plans to go public in May, but delayed them as the company was working to finalize an acquisition of premium-hospitality and live-events company On Location Experiences LLC for as much as $700 million, The Wall Street Journal reported in August, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe deal, if completed, would aid the company\u2019s push to diversify its revenue base. No deal has been announced, however.\n\nEndeavor plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \u201cEDR.\u201d", "description": "Endeavor Group said it plans to raise as much as $712.3 million in its initial public offering, the entertainment company said in a securities filing.", "authors": ["Dave Sebastian"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107378/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
