Auto Show", "language": "en", "text": "Toyota is giving the Rav4 some juice\u2026 in more ways than one.\n\nThe automaker has announced plans to reveal the first plug-in hybrid version of the best-selling vehicle in the USA that\u2019s not a pickup at the L.A. Auto Show in November.\n\nAlong with providing an unspecified all-electric driving range, Toyota said the plug-in will be the most powerful version of the Rav4. That title currently belongs to the standard all-wheel-drive Rav4 hybrid, which has 219 hp and a combined fuel economy rating of 40 mpg.\n\nTESTED: 2019 TOYOTA RAV4 HYBRID\n\nThe only plug-in model Toyota sells today is the Prius Prime, which provides 25 miles of all-electric driving and 54 mpg combined when running in conventional hybrid mode. That\u2019s 2 mpg better than the standard Prius.\n\nFord is also introducing a plug-in version of its Rav4 competitor, the Escape, next spring. Pricing has not been announced, but Ford said the 209 hp compact SUV will only be available in front-wheel-drive and deliver over 30 miles of all-electric range.\n\nToyota has sold 324,622 Rav4s in the U.S. so far this year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Toyota is juicing the Rav4.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
