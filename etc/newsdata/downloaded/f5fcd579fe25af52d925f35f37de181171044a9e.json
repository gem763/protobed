But this is nothing new for the U.S. and Iran. We have the FAQs. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Pentagon will send thousands more troops and two squadrons of fighter jets to Saudi Arabia as tensions increase with Iran.\n\nThe move follows an attack last month on oil production facilities in Saudi Arabia that Iran was \"clearly responsible for,\" Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Friday. Iran denied it had a role in the attacks, which an Iranian-backed proxy force claimed credit for.\n\nThe deployment adds to the 11,000 troops sent to the region since May in response to requests from U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East. Friday's announcement covers troops send to the region or whose deployments have been extended. In all, the Pentagon has added about 3,000 troops over the last month.\n\n\"As we have stated, the United States does not seek conflict with the Iranian regime, but we will retain a robust military capability in the region that is ready to respond to any crisis and will defend U.S. forces and interest in the region,\" chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement.\n\nAn Iranian oil tanker was hit by possible missile strikes near the Saudi port of Jeddah, causing oil to leak into the Red Sea, the ship's owner said.
