But never in a million years did I anticipate that it could actually happen; then came Morris.\n\n'It's the little things I notice most, like being able to open and close doors through Morris rather than asking for assistance of others, or how he patiently picks up an item that I've dropped five times already because my hands are not working well that day.\n\n'I used to be stuck to my carer, but now with Morris and I can go off and my carer will be there as a safety precaution.\n\n'Morris also bridges the gap with strangers and removes the stigma attached to my disability.\n\n'Instead of being someone that is \"pitied\", I now have a bond with Morris that people envy.\n\n'Morris has even given me the confidence to overcome my fear of public speaking and we have now given numerous talks about Canine Partners and have organised many fundraising events.\n\nWhile at the supermarket the Labrador will pick up items for Chloe and gently place them in the basket\n\nMorris helps pick items off the table, such as the TV remote, and helps Chloe with her chores around the home\n\nChloe, whose genetic condition causes muscle weakness and means she must rely on an electric wheelchair for mobility, feels optimistic about the future with the dog by her side\n\n'With Morris, absolutely anything is possible.\n\n'Not only will he look after me physically by moving me in my wheelchair and helping with household tasks but he also reminds me every day that life is beautiful.\n\n'I truly owe my life to this beautiful creature: he's introduced me to the independence that I never thought was possible and a love that I never expected.'\n\nCanine Partners paired Chloe and Morris in 2015 and she couldn't be happier.\n\nHe doesn't just help her with her groceries but also around the house, by unloading the washing machine, fetching the mail and helping her take her shoes off or put her scarf on.\n\nMorris, who was trained by Canine Partners, will assist Chloe when the pair go shopping and is always by the 29-year-old's side\n\nMorris, who has completely changed Chloe's life, will listen to Chloe's commands and collect the items she finds too difficult to reach at the supermarket\n\nThe smart canine will also pick up Chloe's phone if it is dropped and help her with every aspect of her life\n\nShe added: 'I have a degenerative muscle wasting condition that affects all aspects of my life and I need assistance for every single aspect of my care.\n\n'As I approached my late teens, my condition was deteriorating a lot faster than I had expected and I needed multiple surgeries.\n\n'I lost the use of my right side and had to have a feeding tube inserted as my swallowing muscles had deteriorated to a point where I could no longer swallow or chew my food.\n\n'Despite the tough times, I lead a relatively normal life with a crazy sense of humour, yet the pressure of maintaining normality was simply overwhelming.\n\nDuring the supermarket trips, the dog will help pay at the till and collect items from the cashier to place in the basket\n\nThe dog, who can also fetch Chloe's mail, will also open the front door using a rope which is tied to the door knob\n\n'Before Morris, I felt like my life had just paused and I had no idea how to make it start again.\n\n'He has completely changed my life for the better as I'm now able to get on with day to day duties without relying on my carers.\n\n'It feels like we are one person as he can pick things up for me, help me with my food shopping, getting items off the shelves and putting them in the basket along with paying at the till.\n\n'To Morris, helping me is fun and exciting - every task turns into a game for him, which makes me feel much less of a burden.\n\n'He has given me my independence and confidence to do things I never would have before such as public speaking or a weekend away.'", "description": "Chloe Bellotti, 29, from Suffolk, has spinal muscular atrophy and relies on a wheelchair, but since being paired with Morris in 2015, she's gained independence for the first time.", "authors": ["Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/11/19292910-0-image-a-77_1570185276675.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
