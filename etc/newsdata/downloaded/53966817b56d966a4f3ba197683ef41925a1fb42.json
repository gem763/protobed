It offers a strong growth potential for innovative services, as well as increased socio-economic value for citizens.\n\nAs the EU starts working on a new policy vision for the future, we launched the Europe 2030 agenda, a fresh policy vision from ETNO, Europe\u2019s leading telecoms association. Objective: Help Europe co-create the next wave of tech and telecom policies.\n\nBefore formulating a new vision, we met with over 40 stakeholders \u2014 including NGOs and user organizations \u2014 and we reviewed successes and challenges of the current EU agenda: the digital single market strategy. One of the biggest challenges of the strategy has been to make progress at both the infrastructure level and the service level. Has that worked to lay the ground for a successful European digital service industry that can thrive on the global market and deliver for society?\n\nObjective: Help Europe co-create the next wave of tech and telecom policies.\n\nThe effects of public policies typically take several years to unfold, and they are influenced by multiple factors. However, some numbers hint at a gap that needs filling and that requires continued policy action for the years to come. Out of the Forbes Digital 100 ranking of the top 100 public companies shaping the worldwide digital economy, only 13 are from the EU28. Europe also hosts 12 percent of the world\u2019s unicorns, five times less than the U.S. and 2.5 times less than China. When looking at the creation and of new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain, the divide is also still wide.\n\nPolicies for industrial leadership in tech\n\nTo counter this trend, Europe needs an ambitious policy for industrial leadership. One that puts the digital economy at its center and that addresses all segments of the digital value chain and all solutions: we need an integrated digital competitiveness agenda that leverages the strengths of the European digital sector, including the telecommunication industry. Innovation-oriented regulation, demand-side measures, tax policy and other instruments should be regarded as complementary to fostering the European Union\u2019s digital industry capabilities and to encouraging cooperation among industrial actors so that Europe can build scale, especially when it comes to the Internet of Things (IoT) and data-enabled business models.\n\nUltimately, this will be about empowering Europeans. While remaining firmly open to global competition, Europe should shift from consumer to exporter of digital services and offer more European choices to its digital citizens.\n\nThis means focusing on the increase of Europe\u2019s supply of crucial technologies, products or services that underpin the whole digital economy and that have a strategic role for society. In the cloud market, for example, there is a need for more European players, as non-EU cloud infrastructure providers currently account for about 80 percent of the global market. Europe\u2019s policy for industrial leadership should identify the key market segments where the EU digital sector would benefit from less reliance on few, large providers and use all the instruments to promote diversification, including through European solutions.\n\nEurope should shift from consumer to exporter of digital services and offer more European choices to its digital citizens.\n\nIn this context, EU competition policy should be seen as complementary, not opposed to, the EU industrial policy. Defining markets in a dynamic way, providing more flexibility for horizontal cooperation among industrial players and focusing on innovation are all essential to adapting the current framework.\n\nThe role of 5G, the IoT and AI\n\nWorld-class connectivity in 5G and fiber will be a key enabler of Europe\u2019s digital economy and of the increasing digitization of services and industrial processes, cutting costs and increasing efficiencies. What is more, the correlation between digital access and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has now been established by several reports: at least 11 out of the 17 SDGs are boosted by increased digital access.\n\nIn this context, we also know that 5G can enable European leadership in digital services. 5G will underpin the rapid growth of the IoT: the number of mobile IoT connections in Western Europe is set to grow from 78.6 million in 2017 to 433.9 million by 2023. The IoT will have a huge impact on automotive, industry, retail and smart building equipment.\n\nInspired by European values, 5G, the IoT and AI can form a truly powerful virtuous circle.\n\nThe large trove of data generated by IoT connections and devices will create fresh resources for growing data analytics and AI in Europe. If treated responsibly and within Europe\u2019s top privacy standards, this will give a boost to the competitiveness of the EU economy and create new socio-economic opportunities.\n\nInspired by European values, 5G, the IoT and AI can form a truly powerful virtuous circle. It is at the intersection between these three technologies that we can create a new promise for globally competitive European industries. This could be the focus of Europe\u2019s next tech strategy, helping to turn European industrial leadership in tech into reality.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "Why 5G, the IoT and AI should be the focus of Europe\u2019s next digital agenda", "authors": ["Maarit Palovirta", "Director Of Regulatory Affairs", "Paolo Grassia", "Director Of Public Policy"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lion-shutterstock-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
