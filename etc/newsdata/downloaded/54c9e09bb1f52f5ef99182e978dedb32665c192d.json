It emitted 8.48 tons of carbon dioxide per capita in 2017, according to the European Commission\u2019s EDGAR, the emissions database for global atmospheric research. By comparison, Norway emitted 8.85 tons per capita and Sweden just 5.13 tons.\n\nFinland has fallen behind both Norway and Sweden in adopting electric cars \u2014 at the end of 2018, Finland\u2019s fleet of electric cars barely exceeded 2,400 units. In Norway, by contrast, more than 46,000 were sold last year alone, thanks to generous tax incentives\n\nA ministers\u2019 working group on climate and energy policy hopes to change that, said Riikka Yliluoma, a special adviser to Finland\u2019s environment minister.\n\n\u201cAlready this autumn the goal is to finalise acts on electric-car-charging stations, increase tax on fossil fuels in transportation,\u201d she said in an emailed statement.\n\nThere are also plans to set new subsidies for energy- efficiency measures in residential buildings, she said.\n\nThe size of the fuel tax and of the electricity subsidy will be determined as part of Finland\u2019s 2020 fiscal budget, said Outi Honkatukia, the country\u2019s chief climate change negotiator.\n\nThe working group will also commission new studies to identify the best measures to reach carbon neutrality by 2035, Yliluoma said.\n\nThese will include studies on cutting emissions across all sectors and increasing the use of carbon capture and storage sinks for the country\u2019s heavy industries such as forestry.\n\nIndustry accounts for more than half of Finland\u2019s annual carbon emissions, followed by electricity production and transport, which are responsible for just over 10% each, according to OECD data.", "description": "Finland's new government will propose a tax increase later this year on fossil fuel used for transport, as well as measures to help expand electric-vehicle-charging networks, the country's environment ministry told Reuters on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
