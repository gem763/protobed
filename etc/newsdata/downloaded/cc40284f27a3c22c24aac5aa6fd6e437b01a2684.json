(Yes, I\u2019ll fight you over Casino.) Scorsese opus No. 25, The Irishman, features a lot of the strengths of those earlier films, but while it\u2019s a good film, it isn\u2019t a great one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe opening-night feature of the New York Film Festival, The Irishman is a long, discursive tale told by an old man in a nursing home in the 1990s. He provides a three-and-a-half hour answer to the question, \u201cWho killed Jimmy Hoffa?\u201d\n\nThe title character, Robert De Niro\u2019s Frank Sheeran, is a Teamsters-union truck driver in the 1950s who gets busted for stealing sides of beef he\u2019s supposed to be delivering and is defended by an attorney who turns out to be a mob lawyer. (I\u2019ll leave out the name of the actor in question because it\u2019s such an amusing surprise.) As in Scorsese\u2019s other mob movies, the ability to keep one\u2019s mouth shut under pressure from the law is the most highly prized quality, and Frank finds himself the toast of Philadelphia mob bosses (Harvey Keitel and Joe Pesci). Without ever really pausing to think about it, Frank drifts into doing jobs such as blowing up businesses and then murdering people. An inflection point comes when Frank gets introduced to the mobsters\u2019 very good friend over the phone: \u201cThis is Jimmy Hoffa. I heard you paint houses.\u201d Frank paints with blood and brains.\n\nAmong the many pleasing aspects of the film is Scorsese and screenwriter Steve Zaillian\u2019s feel for words. In an age of blathering politicians, logorrheic news anchors, and 25,000-word licensing agreements for the latest OS update, Scorsese\u2019s characters are refreshingly terse. Men who need euphemisms for what they say, both to downplay the horrors of their acts and because they might be under surveillance, make words count. \u201cA little concerned,\u201d as Frank notes, means red alert. If someone tells you, \u201cIt\u2019s what it is,\u201d you might want to head over to your local coffin shop (as Frank does at one point) and pick out a nice model. Pay in advance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrank is a kind of mashup of Henry Hill and Forrest Gump; he\u2019s a war hero, he\u2019s a dirtbag. He\u2019s a dim bulb who tells us his life story without quite grasping the lesson of any of it. And he occasionally wanders into the background of historical events, such as the Bay of Pigs invasion. De Niro deliberately underplays the part, maintaining a granite face as his character drifts into damnation. He\u2019s even more of a moral cipher than Hill, his counterpart in Goodfellas. (Both men, having Irish blood, were liminal figures who could never be full members of the mob, which makes them excellent explainers from the dark side.) Hill\u2019s twisted moral framing derived from a deep, darkly funny cynicism that seems perfectly to match Scorsese\u2019s, whereas De Niro\u2019s Frank appears to lack any internal structure, even at the end, when a kindly priest tries to nudge him into contrition. No deal. I was taken aback when Scorsese, at a press conference after the world premiere, described Frank as \u201cnot a psychotic\u201d and \u201cbasically a good man.\u201d It is to a certain extent the task of artists such as Scorsese and De Niro to humanize even the most wicked individuals, but to even consider the possibility that Frank Sheeran (upon whose memoir the film is based) was a good man strikes me as morally bizarre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only lesson seems to be that if you lie down with dogs, you will get fleas: Once you\u2019ve done a job for the Mafia, you have joined a game that could lead to your own violent death, or worse. But no such realization ever seems to dawn on Frank; his interior landscape is just a blank, and Scorsese doesn\u2019t bring to it anything like the ironic voltage that courses through Goodfellas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Hoffa, Al Pacino makes his debut in Scorseseland and doesn\u2019t waste the opportunity, dominating his scenes and turning De Niro into his straight man. Hoffa\u2019s funny peculiarities provide many of the highlights of the film, such as when he starts an argument over whether it\u2019s okay to be 15 minutes late to a meeting or whether ten is the limit. As much as any two men like them can be, Frank and Hoffa become friends, but really Frank is just a factotum to Hoffa and Scorsese should have done a better job of establishing their bond. One scene of real camaraderie would have sufficed.\n\nWhat we get instead is, particularly in the slow-moving middle third of the film, a lengthy and numbing series of detours into various union beefs and mob hits. Quick: Who\u2019s the guy who gets assassinated at Columbus Circle and why? The pileup of corpses serves very little purpose, and even more so than Goodfellas, this is not a chick flick. There is only one female character of note \u2014 Frank\u2019s daughter Peggy \u2014 and she remains silent virtually throughout (as an adult she\u2019s played by Anna Paquin, proving that Scorsese has so much juice he can get an Oscar winner to play a more or less non-speaking role). I think her silence works dramatically \u2014 from Frank\u2019s point of view, he just can\u2019t get through to her \u2014 but even Goodfellas and Casino featured a major female character whose perspective brought a lot to those films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs always Scorsese excels on the visuals \u2014 the sets and costumes are dazzling, and the new de-aging technology previously seen in movies such as Aquaman (Nicole Kidman) and Captain Marvel (Samuel L. Jackson) enables the principal actors to play much younger versions of themselves without being distracting. The pacing is a problem, though. Scorsese would be wise to remember the example of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, a movie that began and ended brilliantly but lost the audience in the middle, when it got distracted by secondary figures. The Irishman runs three and a half hours, and though some of its sidebars are interesting (notably, a section about how the mob got John F. Kennedy elected president by stuffing ballot boxes in Illinois), it could easily be trimmed by 30 minutes or more by tightening up the midsection. Failing that, a lot of viewers who see it on Netflix, on which it debuts November 27, are going to fall asleep in the middle. (A few theaters will get the movie on November 1.)\n\nThough much of The Irishman covers very well-worn territory for Scorsese without providing new insights, its final scenes go to a place I\u2019m not sure the director has ever gone before. How strange is it to be an assassin in a nursing home? Scorsese is himself 76, albeit extraordinarily vigorous for that age, and he doesn\u2019t seem to have much considered the question of aging before. Now it is striking deep chords. Maybe living long enough to contemplate your sins in depth is a greater punishment than having your brains be used as house paint.", "description": "Scorsese's latest epic exhibits all the strengths he is known for, but it runs too long to be classed among his best.", "authors": ["Kyle Smith", "Andrew C.
