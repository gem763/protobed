The former billionaire\u2019s Reliance Communications itself fell back into bankruptcy earlier this year. The move by subsidiary GCX comes after it missed payment on its $350 million of 7% bonds that matured on Aug. 1.\n\nAmbani has been waging a war on debt, and Reliance Group has said that it planned to raise about 217 billion rupees ($3.1 billion) by selling assets from roads to radio stations in a bid to cut borrowings.

The situation in India is \u201chighly worrying\u201d with a sharp slowdown in the economy and a liquidity crunch due to the collapse of the shadow banking system, he added.\n\nReliance Naval & Engineering Ltd., another firm controlled by Ambani, said recently it is facing an acute cash-flow crunch after orders dried up amid efforts to restructure a pile of debt.\n\nGCX said in July that it had reached a forbearance pact with holders that provided additional time to discuss options related to the maturity of its bonds. Moody\u2019s Investors Service cut its rating on the firm to Ca last month, as it considered the missed payment on the $350 million bonds a default.\n\nGCX along with other associates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the Delaware court, according to a court filing.\n\n(Adds analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Denise Wee in Hong Kong at dwee10@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Andrew Monahan at amonahan@bloomberg.net, Beth Thomas\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A unit of Reliance Communications Ltd., Anil Ambani\u2019s distressed telecom firm, has filed for bankruptcy protection.GCX Ltd., which owns the world\u2019s largest private undersea cable system, is the latest company owned by the tycoon to stumble.
