You don\u2019t get to be Jeff Bezos unless you\u2019re the owner,\u201d Pazzani told FOX Business of realizing he wanted to own his own business well into his retirement. \u201cI never wanted to stop working.\u201d\n\nThe savvy businessman combined his two areas of expertise \u2013 booze and fitness \u2013 to pursue a craft tequila business and an online personal training company aimed at the 50-and-up crowd.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m comfortable. If I was forced to retire, I could, and live to 90, but it wouldn\u2019t be the life I wanted,\u201d Pazzani said.\n\nPazzani is one of many Americans nearing retirement age and starting a business. Indeed, the number of entrepreneurs over age 50 surged by 50 percent since 2007, according to a report by payroll and benefits provider Paychex earlier this year.\n\nAnd with people living longer, more are finding fulfillment in becoming self-employed to pursue passion projects. According to the Social Security Administration, a 65-year-old man in the U.S. can now expect to live until age 84, on average, while a 65-year-old woman is expected to live to age 87.\n\n\u201cI found that people in this stage in their lives come to this point where they think, \u2018What is my legacy? How do I leave my mark? You can do something at 60 for the next 15 years,\u201d said Kerry Hannon, who writes about how to start a successful business midlife in her book \u201cNever Too Old to Get Rich: The Entrepreneur\u2019s Guide to Starting a Business Mid-Life,.\"\n\nHere\u2019s how to start your own midlife business:\n\nDo market research and write up your business plan\n\nHannon says it\u2019s important to know what your purpose is and if there\u2019s really a market for your business idea.\n\nThe U.S. Small Business Administration website outlines exactly how to write up a business plan, from researching if there\u2019s demand for your product, service or idea to measuring the market saturation and how much potential customers would be willing to pay for it.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nLearn a new skill while you\u2019re still working\n\nIf your field requires training, get certified or take a course \u2013 ideally, before you quit your full-time job. Take advantage of tax-free tuition assistance programs. Some companies offer up to $5,250 toward an employee\u2019s education, and the contribution doesn\u2019t have to be for a full-degree program.\n\nGet a mentor\n\nSeven out of 10 adults polled in a survey from AARP this year said they like working with people from generations other than their own. Older employees, for example, said they valued their younger colleagues\u2019 creative new perspectives and tech skills.\n\nHannon agrees: \"Moonlighting or volunteering with someone is a great way to get insight,\" she said.\n\nDo your best to get out of debt and start a budget\n\n\"Debt is the biggest dream-killer,\u201d Hannon said, adding that midlife entrepreneurs should start trimming the financial fat. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018Can you refinance your home? Do you want to move where the cost of living is less? Can you downsize?\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "With people living longer, more are finding fulfillment in starting their own business.
