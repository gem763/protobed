The campaign launch doubled as a kickoff of his 3,500-mile tour across 11 states, dubbed \u201cKids, We\u2019re Bankrupt and We Didn\u2019t Even Know It\u201d:\n\nWe began our trip this morning in Philadelphia. Our Founding Fathers designed a 3-legged stool to keep freedom alive \u2013 sustainable spending, separated power & enough civility to keep us talking as Americans. Lose these things & we lose our civilization. https://t.co/eUjLtprvg2 \u2014 Mark Sanford (@MarkSanford) October 16, 2019\n\nAnna Orso, who covered Sanford\u2019s launch for the Philadelphia Inquirer, noted that she was the only reporter there.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\nAnd when it began, the only others around besides his two aides were a family 30 yards away with a selfie stick and a group of students from Paris who wanted to know why he had such a big check. (Answer: It represented the burden of the national debt.) .. Besides me, news conference attendees included two photographers \u2014 including a Philadelphia Inquirer photographer \u2014 and a 6ABC cameraman who showed up briefly. (\u201cI\u2019ll talk to about 250,000 people in just a second,\u201d Sanford said to me as the cameraman approached with his tripod.) No other local TV station showed up to the kickoff spot, even though Fox 29 is studio is a block away. CBS3 and NBC10\u2019s studios were within two miles of Sanford\u2019s news conference.\n\nShe said Sanford only spoke with one person who did not happen to be an aide, journalist, or the curious foreign students:\n\nI went to Mark Sanford's presidential campaign kickoff in Philly and only one person besides me and a couple photographers showed up :/ https://t.co/FB24ytpS3W \u2014 Anna Orso (@anna_orso) October 16, 2019\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ONE PERSON SHOWED UP TO MARK SANFORD\u2019S CAMPAIGN KICKOFF HAHAHAHAHA https://t.co/uUAiJIuAB5 \u2014 Chris Barron (@ChrisRBarron) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cNobody knows me in Philadelphia. I get it,\u201d Sanford said, according to Orso. \u201cI think in life we all do what we can do, what\u2019s within our power to have an effect. So we\u2019re just sort of moving along as we go along.\u201d\n\nSanford, who is running his campaign, largely, on the issue of debt, is reportedly funding his longshot bid with leftover congressional campaign funds. He hopes to differentiate himself from Trump by displaying \u201cempathy and humility,\u201d according to Orso.\n\nThe former South Carolina governor is, perhaps, most well known for his \u201cAppalachian Trail\u201d scandal in 2009, disappearing for six days to visit his mistress in Buenos Aires, Argentina. His office claimed, during his absence, that he was hiking the Appalachian Trail.\n\nThe scandal did not sink his political career. He dodged impeachment and was later elected to the South Carolina\u2019s 1st Congressional District in 2013 and served until 2019. Trump took partial credit for Sanford\u2019s loss.\n\n\u201cWhen the former Governor of the Great State of South Carolina, @MarkSanford, was reported missing, only to then say he was away hiking on the Appalachian Trail, then was found in Argentina with his Flaming Dancer friend, it sounded like his political career was over,\u201d Trump tweeted in September.\n\n\u201cBut then he ran for Congress and won, only to lose his re-elect after I Tweeted my endorsement, on Election Day, for his opponent,\u201d Trump continued.\n\n\u201cBut now take heart, he is back, and running for President of the United States. The Three Stooges, all badly failed candidates, will give it a go!\u201d he added:\n\n\u2026but then he ran for Congress and won, only to lose his re-elect after I Tweeted my endorsement, on Election Day, for his opponent. But now take heart, he is back, and running for President of the United States. The Three Stooges, all badly failed candidates, will give it a go! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\nSanford joins fellow Republican primary challengers Joe Walsh and Bill Weld, both of whom have been unable to generate a significant campaign buzz. What is more, a handful of states, including South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, and Kansas, are planning to cancel the Republican primary in 2020, further reducing the presidential hopefuls\u2019 chances of realistically challenging Trump.", "description": "Only one person showed up at Mark Sanford's official campaign launch against President Trump in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Mark-Sanford-campaign-launch-Independence-Mall-Philadelphia-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
