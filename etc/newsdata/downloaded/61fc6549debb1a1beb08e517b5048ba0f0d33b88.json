The 76 officers, along with six more at other University of Michigan campuses, received $10.6 million in salaries and benefits. The University of Michigan is now typical of colleges nationwide in its burgeoning diversity payroll. It\u2019s bad enough that our universities spend billions of dollars each year on diversity bureaucrats alone, when all they\u2019re paid to do is propagandize students. It\u2019s worse that our colleges spend American families\u2019 money to subsidize their political correctness\u2014and spend profligately.\n\nHartford, Maine, and Michigan acted like their peers nationwide. The number of college administrators grew by 15% between 2007 and 2014, through the worst years of the Great Recession. Universities used American families\u2019 hard-earned dollars to expand their bureaucracies. Universities like the Illinois public university system increased the number of administrators over a 10-year period even as their student enrollment declined by 5,000.\n\nThe real growth isn\u2019t in the registrar\u2019s office or tech support. The booming offices include student life, diversity, and sustainability. Many of these administrators think their real job is to turn students into radical community activists.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s grant and loan programs have subsidized higher education for more than fifty years. But federal grants and loans mostly work to increase student debt. Students borrow to pay the costs when the college ratchets up tuition to pay for yet another salaried administrator, but colleges aren\u2019t held liable if a student doesn\u2019t receive a degree.\n\nState funding for higher education has increased in recent years, but that just shifts how American families pay for college. Calling the payments \u201ctaxes\u201d instead of tuition doesn\u2019t lower the bill. American families have reached their breaking point.\n\nStudent debt forgiveness plans like Bernie Sanders\u2019s won\u2019t help either. They\u2019ll just require taxpayers to foot the bill.\n\nWe can\u2019t fix higher education unless we fix the problem of student debt. We can\u2019t fix student debt until we stop the bloat in higher education administration.\n\nAll those student life officers and sustainability deans add up. They\u2019re a luxury America can no longer afford.", "description": "Americans\u0092 real family incomes have been stagnant for a generation, but colleges\u0092 inflation-adjusted tuition and fees have risen by about 25% since 2008.
