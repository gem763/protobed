It was honest and heartbreaking,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nI had the honor of sitting down with some of the young adults from Living Undocumented where we had a genuine conversation about the immigration issue and their lives.

I would love for you guys to check it out. \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/fGhKQnvXuU \u2014 Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) October 4, 2019\n\nIn the clip, Selena Gomez becomes visibly emotional and begins crying when listening to her guests, who are identified as Bar, who comes from Israel; and brothers Camilo and Pablo, who come from Colombia.\n\n\u201cA huge part of why I wanted to be a part of this is to also be a voice for so many people who can\u2019t and are terrified to speak about it,\u201d the star told them.\n\nGomez then spoke about her own immigrant family members, though the celebrity didn\u2019t say if these relatives came to the United States legally or illegally.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even think people realize that my family also has a background \u2014 my grandparents were immigrants. Just think about the life I\u2019ve been given and how blessed I am.\u201d\n\nThe pop superstar was born in the U.S, but has Mexican ancestry.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that I see change,\u201d she said at the end of the clip. \u201cI just think you are wonderful people.\u201d\n\nThe clip concludes with a written on-screen message from Gomez:\n\nImmigration is a complex issue, and while I don\u2019t have answers on how to fix it, it needs to be talked about. Bar, Camilo and Pablo were brought to the United States when they were children. They grew up here, built their lives here, and they know no other home than this country. No one should be subjected to the condition that their families have had to endure.\n\nGomez recently wrote in a Time magazine editorial in which she said she was approached in 2017 about getting involved with the show. Without once again distinguishing between legal and illegal immigration, she said the show intends to \u201cshine a light on eight immigrant families in the U.S. from different countries and backgrounds, all facing possible deportation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a Mexican-American woman I feel a responsibility to use my platform to be a voice for people who are too afraid to speak,\u201d she wrote.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
