She was simply making an observation.\"\n\nTrudeau, who is up for reelection Oct. 21 but now faces uncertainty at the polls because of the scandal, apologized during a news conference in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on Thursday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nConcha said Trudeau is obviously hoping the scandal blows over -- with help from the media.\n\n\"It's almost sympathy,\" Concha said of the media's coverage of Trudeau. \"And he's going to play the Ralph Northam playbook at this point. Just let it blow over. And by the weekend we're not going to hear a thing about this moving forward.\"\n\nFox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau\u00a0is geting \"a pass\" from the mainstream media in reaction to his blackface scandal, The Hill media reporter\u00a0Joe Concha\u00a0said Friday.", "authors": ["Victor Garcia"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/21/694940094001_6088218202001_6088217481001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
