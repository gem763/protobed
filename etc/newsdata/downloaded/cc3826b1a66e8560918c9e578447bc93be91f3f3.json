The wife of a European lawmaker from the ruling Fidesz party, Hando faced criticism over judicial appointments and an oversight committee previously recommended her impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t want a war over the judiciary,\u201d Agoston Samuel Mraz, head of the pro-Orban Nezopont Intezet, a political research institute in Budapest, said by phone. \u201cWith the ongoing EU probe, it\u2019s in the government\u2019s strategic interest to put to rest rule-of-law issues.\u201d\n\nOrban, who\u2019s centralized power to an unprecedented degree in the EU since his return to power in 2010, has backpedaled on several of the issues at the center of the bloc\u2019s probe into the erosion of democratic standards, which has threatened billions of euros in subsidies. In May, Orban scrapped a plan to carve up the supreme court, which would\u2019ve boosted his government\u2019s influence over the judiciary.\n\nOrban, who this month suffered his worst electoral setback in more than a decade, is also angling to retain his party\u2019s membership in the European People\u2019s Party, the center-right bloc that includes German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s party.\n\nThe EPP in March suspended Fidesz\u2019s membership indefinitely, citing rule-of-law concerns. European Council President Donald Tusk, an Orban-critic, is widely expected to become the group\u2019s new president next month. A decision on whether the Hungarian ruling party can stay in the center-right fold will be one of the first issues he\u2019ll have to confront.\n\n\u201cOrban doesn\u2019t want to keep anything on the agenda that may serve as a pretext for the EPP to expel Fidesz,\u201d said Mraz, the political analyst. \u201cHe wants to make sure that discussion about EPP is purely ideological and not based on facts.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Marton Eder.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Zoltan Simon in Budapest at zsimon@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Balazs Penz at bpenz@bloomberg.net, Andrew Langley\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hungary will replace the controversial head of its judiciary, the latest sign that Prime Minister Viktor Orban is trying to quell rule-of-law concerns in the European Union member.Orban\u2019s party on Monday nominated Tunde Hando to become a justice on the Constitutional Court, effectively", "authors": ["Zoltan Simon"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
