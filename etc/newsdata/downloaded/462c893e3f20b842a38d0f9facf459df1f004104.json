He specifically criticized Nike for removing Houston Rockets merchandise from China after the regime moved to punish the team.\n\n\u201cNike promotes itself as a so-called social justice champion, but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,\u201d Pence said.\n\nHe also cited several players and owners in the NBA for caving to Chinese demands.\n\n\u201cSome of the NBA\u2019s biggest players and owners who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of the people of China,\u201d he said.\n\nHe criticized the NBA for acting like a \u201cwholly-owned subsidiary\u201d of the Communist Party in China.\n\n\u201cA progressive corporate culture that willfully ignores the abuse of human rights is not progressive, it is repressive,\u201d Pence said.\n\nHe urged all American corporations to stand up for American values of freedom and democracy as President Donald Trump worked to balance the country\u2019s economic relationship with China.\n\n\u201cWhen American corporations, professional sports, pro athletes embrace censorship, it\u2019s not just wrong, it\u2019s un-American,\u201d he said.\n\nPence signaled support for the protesters in Hong Kong, noting that its society was a representation of what a free China could look like.\n\n\u201cWe respect the sovereignty of nations, but America also expects Bejing to honor its commitments,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAnd President Trump has repeatedly made it clear that it would be much harder for us to make a trade deal if the authorities resort to the use of violence against the protestors of Hong Kong.\u201d", "description": "Mike Pence criticized American corporations on Thursday for submitting to Chinese censorship demands, singling out Nike and the NBA.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177955488-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
