USA TODAY\n\nLANDOVER, Md. \u2014 Kyle Shanahan tried to downplay his return to Washington all week.\n\nBut it became clear Sunday that this one was personal.\n\nAfter Shanahan led the San Francisco 49ers to a sloppy 9-0 win over the Washington Redskins on Sunday, tight end George Kittle said Shanahan gave the game ball to his father, Mike.\n\nThe younger Shanahan worked as his father's offensive coordinator in Washington from 2010 through 2013, when the Redskins fired the staff and hired Jay Gruden.\n\n\"It had nothing to do with the game,\" Kyle Shanahan said in his postgame news conference, when asked if there was an added magnitude to Sunday's win given his history with the Redskins.\n\n\"Everyone's a little more sensitive to things that involve your family, so that's why I'm always a little more sensitive to this because of what I went through with my dad here. And that's why it was nice to get the win.\"\n\nOct 20, 2019; Landover, MD, USA; San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan walks down the sidelines during the third quarter against the Washington Redskins at FedExField.

But the tenor of this visit was clearly different, given the diverging paths of the two franchises.\n\nWhile the 49ers are 6-0 and the lone undefeated team in the NFC, the Redskins are 1-6, with their only win of the season to date coming against the equally-awful Miami Dolphins last week. They also fired Gruden earlier this month.\n\nShanahan didn't openly roast his former employer leading up to Sunday's game, but he did sneak in a few jabs. When asked this week about the best part of his time in Washington, he said he enjoyed working with his father and some of the other coaches on staff. The worst part? \"Everything else,\" he said.\n\nMake no mistake: Shanahan wanted to win this one, bad. And his players knew it.\n\n\"We were aware,\" Kittle said wryly, when asked about his coach's history with the Redskins. \"It definitely was a game that we wanted to win for both him and Mike Shanahan. And it was really fun that we could get that for him.\"\n\nAs for the move to give Mike Shanahan the game ball?\n\n\"Pretty special,\" Kittle added.\n\nThe 49ers didn't run up the score, but they didn't really have the opportunity to do so. Faced with an steady downpour throughout the game, both teams struggled to throw and catch the ball, and three Robbie Gould field goals accounted for the entirety of the scoring.\n\nIf the weather had been more favorable, perhaps Shanahan would've aimed for a more lopsided final score. Of course, he would probably never admit as much. After the game, he avoided even acknowledging that his father got the game ball.\n\n\"Uh, no one,\" Shanahan said, before suggesting that it had gone to the whole team.\n\nIn the end, he framed Sunday's game as an opportunity to simply take care of some business. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\n\"(My family's history here) definitely had nothing to do with the game, has nothing to do with the score,\" Shanahan said. \"But you always want to take care of things the right way when you're bothered by how some things have been for a family member.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "description": "Kyle Shanahan was cryptic about his relationship with his former employer, but he sent a message about how the Redskins treated his father.", "authors": ["Tom Schad", "Published P.M.
