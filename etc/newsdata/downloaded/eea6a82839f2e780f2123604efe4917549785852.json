It\u2019s time for lawmakers to show some spine, reject this heartless plan and get to work on bipartisan solutions that will reduce the cost of medicine without harming seniors.\u201d\n\nThe House Democrats\u2019 drug pricing legislation is the latest priority for AAN, which reportedly spent more than $50 million in the last cycle, and spent $23 million promoting the tax reform legislation signed into law by President Trump.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
