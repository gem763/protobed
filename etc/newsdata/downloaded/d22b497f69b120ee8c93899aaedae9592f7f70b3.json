Ted Cruz in Washington this week.\n\nMs. Milano told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo Tuesday night that she was appreciative for the meeting and the chance to speak face to face with someone she would consider a political foe.\n\n\u201cI felt like this meeting was important, obviously, to reach across the aisle, to have a civil discussion on this matter, to look at him in the eye and say, \u2018You\u2019re on the wrong side of this,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Milano said that while Mr. Cruz didn\u2019t make any promises on stricter gun control measures like universal background checks, he did agree that gun violence is a \u201cserious problem,\u201d and that\u2019s good enough for her right now.\n\n\u201cI think he gets it,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, to understand it and then to have the courage and the fortitude to do something about it are two very, very different things. So I\u2019m cautiously optimistic that he knows the issue and hopeful, I guess, that he\u2019s willing to do something about it.\u201d\n\nMr. Cruz had agreed to meet with Ms. Milano at his Capitol Hill office after they shared words about the Second Amendment on Twitter last week and Ms. Milano said she wanted to hear the senator\u2019s \u201cbulls\u2014t\u201d in person. Mr. Cruz said at the time that he was looking forward to the meeting as long as the two could remain civil.\n\nFred Guttenberg, whose daughter was killed in the 2018 Parkland, Florida, shooting, and gun control activist Ben Jackson joined the hourlong conversation that was livestreamed on Facebook.\n\nDuring the discussion, Ms. Milano revealed that she owns two guns at home for self-defense and that her goal isn\u2019t to strip law-abiding people of their rights.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to take all guns from all people, we want to take certain guns away from certain people,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
