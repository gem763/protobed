We explain why this is the case. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 House Democrats have escalated their impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's pressuring of the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, subpoenaing White House and administration officials over documents and testimony related to Trump's contacts with Ukraine.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it would not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, setting up a clash between the legislative and executive branches.\n\nWhat is a 'kangaroo court'?: Merriam-Webster defines 'kangaroo court' after GOP uses it as impeachment defense\n\nInquiry updates: Donald Trump impeachment inquiry: White House says 'no' to Nancy Pelosi. China says 'no' to Joe Biden probe\n\nTrump says no cooperation: Donald Trump to Nancy Pelosi: No cooperation in 'partisan' impeachment investigation\n\nIf the White House does not comply with a subpoena, the House could file a civil lawsuit, or hold people in contempt of Congres. It is unclear what ability Congress has to enforce its subpoenas, though.\n\nHere are all of the officials or individuals who have been subpoenaed or asked to provide information to congressional investigators since House Democrats announced their formal impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24.\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry (Oct. 10)\n\nThe House Oversight, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs committees subpoenaed Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Oct. 10 for documents relating to House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.\n\nCongressional Democrats saw Perry as playing a role in \"reinforcing the President's stark message to the Ukrainian President,\" the committees said in a letter.\n\nGiuliani associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman (Oct. 10)\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of Rudy Giuliani and Ukrainian-born business partners, were subpoenaed for documents relating to the impeachment inquiry on Oct. 10.\n\nThey were arrested on Oct. 9 on campaign finance charges and had been among the witnesses congressional investigators had hoped to question. The men helped Giuliani meet a Ukrainian prosecutor as part of Giuliani's push for an investigation into Biden.\n\nTheir federal indictment alleges they \u201cconspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and state office so that the defendants could buy potential influence with candidates, campaigns and the candidates\u2019 governments.\u201d\n\nEuropean Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland (Oct. 8)\n\nGordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, was scheduled to meet with congressional investigators on Oct. 7 but was directed by the White House not to hold the meeting.\n\nSondland had been at the center of text messages released as part of Ukrainian envoy Kurt Volker's testimony to Congress last week, and lawmakers on both parties had been looking forward to hearing from Sondland before his testimony was canceled.\n\n\"I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public,\" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.\n\nIn response, House Democrats issued a subpoena in an attempt to compel Sondland's testimony and to force the release of text messages or emails on one of his personal devices.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper/The Pentagon (Oct. 7)\n\nHouse Democrats also sought information from Defense Secretary Mark Esper on any relevant information on the withholding of military aid to Ukraine\n\nThey issued a subpoena to Esper and the Department of Defense on Oct. 7.\n\nActing Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought (Oct. 7)\n\nIn response to media reports that Trump had ordered then-acting OMB Director Mick Mulvaney to halt military aid to Ukraine, House Democrats issued a subpoena on Oct. 7.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the White House on Wednesday Vought said he and his office would not be cooperating in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nActing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney/The White House (Oct. 4)\n\nHouse Democrats sent a letter on Oct. 4 to acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney carrying subpoenas related to documents relating to the impeachment inquiry. The White House was given a deadline of Oct. 18 to comply.\n\nThe subpoena came after the White House ignored several other requests for documents.\n\nVice President Mike Pence (Oct. 4)\n\nHouse Democrats issued a request for documents to Vice President Mike Pence relating to the inquiry on Oct. 4, but it appears that Pence's office will not comply with the request.\n\n\"Given the scope, it does not appear to be a serious request but just another attempt by the Do Nothing Democrats to call attention to their partisan impeachment,\" spokeswoman Katie Waldman said in a statement.\n\nPence's office was given an Oct. 15 deadline to produce the documents. A failure to comply with the request could constitute \"evidence of obstruction,\" Democrats said.\n\nRudy Giuliani (Sept. 30)\n\nDemocrats subpoenaed Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Sept. 30 for documents related to his contacts and dealings with Ukrainian officials. Giuliani had played a central role in the controversy around the pressuring of the Ukrainian government to open investigations.\n\nHe told The Washington Post on Oct. 8 he would not comply with the subpoena.\n\n\"Let them hold me in contempt. We\u2019ll go to court. We\u2019ll challenge the contempt,\" he told The Washington Post.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo (Sept. 27)\n\nDemocrats subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sept. 27 for documents related to Ukraine.\n\nPompeo failed to comply with the Oct. 4 deadline to produce documents.\n\n\"Sadly there have been congressional inquiries that have harassed and abused State Department employees,\" Pompeo told reporters in Greece during a news conference with that country's foreign minister.\n\n\"We'll obviously do all the things that we are required to do by law,\" he said, without specifying how long it might take to comply.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe, Bart Jansen, Deirdre Shesgreen, Christal Hayes\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/09/impeachment-trump-who-has-been-subpoenaed/3912226002/", "description": "Congressional investigators have now subpoenaed nine Trump administration officials and individuals relating to the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Nicholas Wu", "Published A.M.
