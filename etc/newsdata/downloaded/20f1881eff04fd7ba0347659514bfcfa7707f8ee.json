One example came Friday night in the District, north of the White House.\n\nIt was after dark, and near Scott Circle, the grassy area on 16th Street NW about half a dozen blocks, or three quarters of a mile, directly north of the White House.\n\nWhat D.C. police officers noticed while on patrol in the area, police said, was two people \u201cpeering into\u201d parked cars. That was apparently a sign that the two should be watched.\n\nPolice said the officers did just that.\n\nThey saw the two, the police said, go up to someone who was asleep. The two took a backpack, which contained a laptop computer and then \u201cattempted to flee.\u201d\n\nBut they did not get far. The officers stopped and arrested them and recovered the backpack, police said.\n\nBy coincidence, a backpack figured in an investigation reported Saturday by the sheriff\u2019s office in Calvert County, in Southern Maryland.\n\nAfter thefts from cars near Little Cove Point Road in the Lusby area on Aug. 27 and 29, the sheriff\u2019s office said, officers stopped someone wearing a backpack and riding a bicycle on that road a few nights after the thefts.\n\nThe bicycle rider, authorities said, happened to know of \u201cthe individual responsible\u201d for the thefts. Ultimately, the sheriff\u2019s office said, someone was arrested and charged.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The officers were on patrol when they noticed the two \u201cpeering into\u201d parked cars.", "authors": ["Martin Weil", "Local Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
