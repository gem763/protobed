But flavoured vapes have become common in countries like the U.S., thanks to a loophole in regulations.\n\nEditor's Note: While flavoured vapes are less common in Australia, there are still ways to obtain them. It's important to consider these safety warnings if you're planning on, or already using them.\n\nAs Wired reports, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was created in the early 20th century, it oversaw food and drugs in America, and soon afterward, cosmetics. Tobacco companies lobbied to not be considered a drug, so the FDA had no say over what was in them or how they could be labelled in the country.\n\nOver time, laws in the U.S. changed, but it wasn\u2019t until 2009 that the FDA was even allowed to regulate new tobacco products (old ones \u2014 cigarettes \u2014 were grandfathered in). It took years for the FDA to realise that maybe they should step in and do something about \u201ce-cigarettes,\u201d as most government agencies still call vaping devices. According to a new rule, they will have to approve new e-liquids and devices. But that rule won\u2019t take effect until at least 2020, and may be pushed even farther into the future.\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\nEditor's Note: Australia is currently developing regulation around e-cigarettes, but the law is very unclear in regards to their use, meaning that vaping devices are semi-unregulated.\n\nAll this time, the makers of e-liquids and other vaping products haven\u2019t necessarily had to prove that their ingredients are safe before selling them in the U.S. It seems logical that flavourings should be harmless, but it turns out that many aren\u2019t.\n\nDiacetyl, safe when used as a butter flavouring on popcorn, causes a respiratory condition now known as \u201cpopcorn lung\u201d when inhaled. The vitamin E acetate that\u2019s likely behind cases of the recent vaping illness isn\u2019t dangerous to ingest, but it seems to be turning out that it\u2019s fatal when inhaled. (Vitamin E acetate is not in most commercial flavoured vapes; it seems to be mainly in black market THC vapes.)\n\nA new study found that a mint flavouring, pulegone, is present at high levels in some e-liquids. Unfortunately it\u2019s already known to be carcinogenic, and has been banned by the FDA as a food additive. It\u2019s one of many carcinogens in cigarettes and other tobacco products, but at lower levels than what\u2019s in the e-liquids.\n\nBasically, just because something is safe to eat does not mean it\u2019s safe to breathe \u2014 but most vape ingredients are untested, so it\u2019s almost impossible to know whether what you\u2019re breathing in is good for your lungs or not.", "description": "Just because a flavouring is safe to eat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe to inhale.
