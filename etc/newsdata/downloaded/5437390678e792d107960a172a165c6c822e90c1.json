When you watch them move, it looks like a strange lemur walking on spiders.'\n\nProf Hartstone-Rose and NC State post-doctoral researcher Edwin Dickinson were studying the tendons that lead to the aye-aye's unusual hands when they noticed that one of the tendons branched off toward a small structure on the wrist.\n\nThe pair dissected six aye-ayes, and used digital imaging and worked out that the digit moved a lot like a human thumb.\n\nA rare black aye-aye named Melisandre born at Duke Lemur Centre, North Carolina, USA\n\nIt is the first extra digit ever found in a primate.\n\nProf Hartstone-Rose said: 'The pseudothumb is definitely more than just a nub. It has both a bone and cartilaginous extension and three distinct muscles that move it.\n\n'The pseudothumb can wriggle in space and exert an amount of force equivalent to almost half the aye-aye's body weight. So it would be quite useful for gripping.'\n\nThe team examined male and female aye-ayes of all ages and found the same finger in both the left and right hands of each one.\n\nProf Hartstone-Rose and Dr Dickinson believe the aye-aye could have developed the pseudothumb to grip - something its other specialised fingers can't do.\n\nProf Hartstone-Rose added: 'Other species, like the panda bear, have developed the same extra digit to aid in gripping because the standard bear paw is too generalised to allow the dexterity necessary for grasping.\n\nSuperstitious villagers in Madagascar believe the animals sneak into homes through thatched roofs and kill the occupants in their sleep by puncturing their hearts with their long middle finger\n\n'And moles and some extinct swimming reptiles have added extra digits to widen the hand for more efficient digging or swimming.\n\n'In this case, the aye-aye's hand is so specialised for foraging an extra digit for mobility became necessary.\n\n'Some other primate species have reduced digits to aid in locomotion.\n\n'The aye-aye is the first primate to dial digits up in the hand rather than dial them down.\n\n'And it's amazing that it's been there the whole time, in this strangest of all primates, but no one has noticed it until now.'\n\nThe findings were published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology.", "description": "New research has found that the long-fingered lemurs from Madagascar have tiny sixth fingers called 'pseudothumbs' - complete with their own fingerprints - that may help them grip objects.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/12/20032832-0-image-a-88_1571744986391.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
