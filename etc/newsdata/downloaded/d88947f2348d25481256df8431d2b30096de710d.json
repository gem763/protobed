If I am unemployed and I hang about the park, why should somebody accuse me of the crime of hanging around? It is the colonialist that feared that Africans being around that drafted that law. It should be repealed,\u201d he said.\n\nMuseveni also ordered the release of street vendors and hawkers serving jail sentences for selling clothes, food, trinkets, spices, fruits and household goods on the pavements in the capital, Kampala.\n\n\u201cAll people that have been arrested on account of this nonsensical crime should be released immediately and all prosecution discontinued because, in any case, the police and courts have got more real crimes that they need to deal with (murder, rape, robbery, embezzlement, etc),\u201d said Museveni in a tweet on Thursday.\n\nYoweri K Museveni (@KagutaMuseveni) All people that have been arrested on account of this nonsensical crime should be released immediately & all prosecution discontinued because, in any case, the Police and the Courts have got more real crimes that they need to deal with (murder, rape, robbery, embezzlement, etc)\n\nPatricia, a street vendor on the capital\u2019s Kampala Road welcomed the directive.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the president\u2019s gesture. This is a big relief for us. As vendors we can\u2019t afford the rent fees for arcades. The police and enforcement officers have been torturing us,\u201d said Patricia, a mother of three.\n\nThere are more than 10,000 vendors and hawkers in Kampala who have been engaged in running battles with the Kampala City Authority enforcement officers and police over illegal trade in the streets, with some of them arrested, charged and jailed. They face heavy fines and two-month prison sentences.\n\nBut Museveni\u2019s actions have been challenged. Male Kiwanuka Mabirizi, a Kampala lawyer filed a case at the high court in Kampala this week, challenging the president\u2019s directive as illegal, unreasonable, irrational and procedurally improper.\n\nIn his lawsuit, Mabirizi isarguing for the civil court to quash the directives and issue a permanent injunction and prohibition of any Ugandan government official or agency from implementing the orders.\n\n\u201cI am suing Museveni because he is taking Uganda back to [late dictator president] Idi Amin days, where he used decrees to expel Asians, kill citizens without trial, ban international media, etc,\u201d Mabirizi told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cThe inspector general of police is required to act according to the law. The offence of idle and disorderly is in the Penal Code Act, laws of Uganda,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe director of public prosecution is independent and cannot take directives from the president.\u201d\n\nFrank Baine, Uganda\u2019s prison spokesperson, said the directive will be respected and observed once received by the authorities.\n\n\u201cIf the president has directed, the attorney general is going to write and the directive will be adhered [to] accordingly. We are waiting for the official communication and act,\u201d said Baine.\n\n\u201cWe have had [presidential] pardons, we have had other directives and we always respond to them,\u201d he said.\n\nUgandan student sues President Museveni for blocking him on Twitter Read more\n\nHowever, Mabirizi said the president doesn\u2019t have the powers to direct the release of inmates serving sentences without the advice of the advisory committee.\n\n\u201cThe president can only exercise his prerogative of mercy upon being advised by the advisory committee on prerogative of mercy,\u201d said Mabirizi.\n\n\u201cUganda prisons admit and release prisoners upon court orders or a duly signed and sealed presidential pardon reached upon the advice of the committee on prerogative of mercy, and not on directives communicated through police,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMuseveni is not an appellate court to set aside convictions and sentences of courts. If he wants to help the convicts, let him pay for them the fines imposed by court. If Museveni wants the penal codes to be repealed, he should table a bill in parliament ,as he did with removing [presidential] term limits and age limits. Other than that, he has no powers to direct the police, director of public prosecutions or prisons,\u201d said Mabirizi.", "description": "Yoweri Museveni urges repeal of \u2018colonial\u2019 law grounded in \u2018fear of Africans\u2019 as he orders release of those jailed for \u2018nonsensical crime\u2019", "authors": ["Samuel Okiror"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a58f7a780f90bbdec14dd4fbc675676bb88146/470_723_3819_2292/master/3819.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bd2206fc1b4a40165ff1de67d719bc9f", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
