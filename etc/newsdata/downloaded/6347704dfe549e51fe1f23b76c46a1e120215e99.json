Guests included the indomitable Dame Joan Collins, and as the wine flowed, conversation got around to death...\n\nAs we sat together after the golf \u2013 at the sumptuous Bearwood Lakes course in Berkshire \u2013 I asked him what it was like in the South African dressing room just before kick-off in the final against New Zealand\u2019s supposedly unbeatable All Blacks.\n\n\u2018Very tense,\u2019 he said. \u2018We all knew what this game meant to everyone in South Africa so I was trying to calm everyone down, including myself. Then Mandela walked in wearing one of our shirts with the Springbok on his heart, and that was so powerful because rugby was considered the white people\u2019s sport in South Africa, and had become a symbol of hate for black people. I felt this surging emotion rise up inside me \u2013 we all did \u2013 and it reduced most of us to tears. Mandela said \u2018Good luck, boys\u2019 and turned to leave, and I saw he was wearing my number on the back, and I just lost it. I went from being the voice of calm to wanting to go out and destroy every New Zealander in our way!\u2019\n\n\u2018What did Mandela say to you after you lifted the trophy?\u2019\n\n\u2018He said, \u201cFrancois, thank you for what you have done for this country.\u201d But I said to him, \u201cNo, Mr President, thank YOU for what YOU have done for this country.\u201d \u2019\n\nSuddenly, Pienaar paused talking and teared up. \u2018It makes me emotional every time I think about it. It\u2019s impossible to overstate the impact of that victory, and how important it was that Mandela persuaded the black people in South Africa to see us as THEIR team, that we were ONE country and playing for EVERYONE whatever their skin colour. Of course, it helped that we had a black player, Chester Williams, in the side. He became a trailblazer for black kids, and their support made a huge difference. Wherever I go, 25 years later, black South Africans still call me \u201cCaptain\u201d. It\u2019s the proudest thing in my life.\u2019\n\nPienaar\u2019s charity, Make A Difference Leadership Foundation (MAD), gives bright young South African kids from deprived backgrounds a chance to fulfil their potential.\n\nAs he spoke about them, his eyes welled up again.\n\nI\u2019ve met a lot of inspiring people in my life, including Mandela himself, but few have moved me quite like Pienaar, whose burning passion for life rages from every pore of his massive frame.\n\nAs for what it takes to play high-level sport, he explained: \u2018No amount of money can buy ball skills, speed or class\u2026 so that may explain why you never played international rugby, Piers.\u2019\n\nFRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 6\n\nBy an incredibly sad and shocking coincidence, Chester Williams died of a heart attack today, aged only 49. Along with Mandela and Pienaar, he was the face of South Africa\u2019s greatest sporting moment.\n\nAnd now, only Pienaar is left.\n\nYet the legend of all those involved in that day will live on for ever.\n\nInvictus, a Latin word meaning \u2018unconquerable\u2019, was the title of a Victorian poem by English poet William Henley, and is about how he overcame having a leg amputated at 16.\n\n\u2018I am the master of my fate,\u2019 it ends, \u2018I am the captain of my soul.\u2019\n\nIt became a testament to never-say-die resilience.\n\nChurchill, as defeat to the Nazis seemed inevitable, told the House of Commons in late 1941: \u2018We are still masters of our fate, we still are captain of our souls.\u2019\n\nMandela, who loved the poem\u2019s message and often recited it to fellow prisoners during his 27-year incarceration, gave a copy of it to Pienaar to inspire him and his team in the World Cup, when nobody gave them a chance of winning.\n\nBottom line: never give up, however difficult things look.\n\nTHURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 19\n\nJohn Humphrys, legendarily irascible host of Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, recorded his last show today after 32 years.\n\nI often appeared as one of his guests, or should I say victims, and the true scale of his grumpiness cannot be overstated.\n\nHe once had to do a 4.15am pre-taped interview with me when I was working in America, after Kevin Pietersen was sacked by England.\n\n\u2018Morgan,\u2019 he sighed, as we were connected, \u2018can you even begin to imagine the horror of discovering the first thing I have to do this morning is talk to YOU about bloody CRICKET?\u2019\n\nOn another occasion, I arrived in his studio to hear him growl: \u2018And talking of overrated\u2026 morning, Piers.\u2019\n\nI thought for a moment we were on air, but we weren\u2019t.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re in good company,\u2019 he chortled, \u2018we were discussing Harold Pinter.\u2019\n\nDespite his impertinence, Humphrys is the greatest radio newsman of them all. I\u2019ll miss him.\n\nFRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 20\n\nDinner at 5 Hertford Street in Mayfair, the glamorous private members\u2019 club to where I dispatched my old friend Meghan Markle in a cab for what turned out to be her first fateful meeting with Prince Harry \u2013 and the last time she ever spoke to me.\n\nOther guests included the indomitable Dame Joan Collins, and as the wine flowed, conversation got around to death.\n\n\u2018Piers, you\u2019d be the perfect person to do the eulogy at my memorial service,\u2019 Joan declared.\n\nPause. \u2018Actually, looking at the state of you, I suspect I\u2019ll be doing yours.\u2019", "description": "'Piers, you'd be the perfect person to do the eulogy at my memorial service,' Joan declared.
