In a candid interview with Playboy, the Godzilla: King of the Monsters actor revealed he and his wife of four-years, Mollie, are swingers, noting \"it\u2019s now called being 'part of the lifestyle.' The term swinging is old.\"\n\nThe lifestyle came up when the interviewer mentioned how Middleditch and one of the Godzilla writers visited a swingers club with their partners during production. The 37-year-old actor, who is best known for his starring role on HBO's Silicon Valley, was asked how familiar he is with \"the swinging scene.\"\n\nView photos Actor Thomas Middleditch (L) and Mollie Gates arrive for the 68th Emmy Awards on September 18, 2016 at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles. / AFP / Robyn Beck (Photo credit should read ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images) More\n\n\"I don\u2019t know how much I can say, because I don\u2019t want my wife to be mad at me,\" he replied. \"Only after I got married was I like, 'Mollie, I\u2019m sorry, but we have to get nontraditional here.' To her credit, instead of saying 'F*** you, I\u2019m out,' she was like, 'Let\u2019s figure this out.'\"\n\nMiddleditch continued, \"To be honest, swinging has saved our marriage. We have different speeds, and we argue over it constantly, but it\u2019s better than feeling unheard and alone and that you have to scurry in the shadows. By the way, it\u2019s now called being 'part of the lifestyle.' The term swinging is old.\"\n\nThe actor clarified he was not always interested in being part of the lifestyle.\n\n\"I self-deprecatingly call myself a pervert, but that\u2019s not what it is. I just like it,\" he explained. \"I\u2019m sexual. I\u2019d always thought I was a romantic and that when I fall in love, that stuff fades away. It does for some years \u2014 enough to be like, 'I should get married, and I\u2019ll be different.' But it\u2019s part of me. If that\u2019s part of your being and it feels important to you, find a way to explore it, because repression sucks.\"\n\nMiddleditch said it's important to know one\u2019s boundaries if you're part of the lifestyle.\n\n\"For anything sexual \u2014 whether in terms of the sex act or identity or kink \u2014you want to know where the walls of the box are,\" he shared. \"Mollie and I have created our own rules, and compared to most of the people we\u2019ve met who do this kind of s***, our rules are strict. We\u2019re not off on our own; we\u2019re together, a unit. It\u2019s a perpetual state of management and communication, to the point where it\u2019s like, 'All right, we\u2019ve got to stop. Chill.'\"\n\n\"I\u2019m gas, and she\u2019s brakes,\" he added. \"This is actually the premise for a comedy series we\u2019re writing together.\"\n\nMiddleditch said he identifies as \"pretty vanilla, probably cis-hetero\" although he's witnessed some interesting situations. \"I\u2019m of the mentality 'We\u2019re only here once,'\" he stated. \"I don\u2019t believe in reincarnation or an afterlife, any of that s***. If I look around, I actually see a lot of shit that makes me sad about the world. This is a positive way of connecting with people and experiencing things on a very selfish level.\"\n\nWhile he's been to parties \"that were very Eyes Wide Shut,\" he maintained he doesn't \"need it.\"\n\n\"Myself and a lot of other people who start on this journey don\u2019t know where they\u2019re at in it,\" he explained. \"They\u2019re going, 'I think I just need a thing to happen. All I know is, this particular situation is hard.' I love my wife like I\u2019ve never loved anyone before. With two people who feel that way about each other, how do you go down that road? It\u2019s tough. Bring a therapist along for the ride.\"\n\nWhile Middleditch joked he'd be \"honored\" to inadvertently be the face of the lifestyle, his wife might not be as eager to have their private life in the headlines.\n\n\"I don\u2019t give a f***, but my wife is more private, so I have to juggle that,\" he said, adding, \"The perception is that you open up that door and it\u2019s Eyes Wide Shut, which isn\u2019t necessarily the case. ... My mantra is, How can I explore this with a 1960s, peace-and-love, full-understanding, everyone\u2019s-connected-and-feels-good kind of way? Not every corner is explored, but you have to be patient. I battle my own needs. Sometimes I\u2019m a ravenous little monster, and how do I calm that down?\"", "description": "The 37-year-old actor says he and his wife have rules:  \"Instagram f**** up marriages.\"", "authors": ["Taryn Ryder"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/R303HCyLpcbuugaWlu.LqQ--~B/aD0zMjgwO3c9NDkyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/8b2ddd20-d984-11e9-bf7d-461b0764d725", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
