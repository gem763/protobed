REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File Photo\n\nThe brewing giant, which in July tried to raise up to $9.8 billion through an initial public offering (IPO) of Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd, said on Tuesday it would offer 1.3 billion shares at between HK$27 and HK$30 ($3.45-$3.83) apiece.\n\nThe flotation will be a test of investor appetite following anti-government protests that have roiled Hong Kong for nearly four months and have weighed on the stock market.\n\nIf completed, the IPO would provide a boost for the former British colony after China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) last month delayed a listing worth up to $15 billion amid the unrest.\n\n\u201cYou could say that the conditions are more challenging, but when we listen to potential investors we believe that there is solid excitement about this business and its IPO,\u201d said Jan Craps, CEO of Budweiser APAC.\n\nThe new Budweiser APAC offering includes a rare \u201cupsize\u201d option that will enable the company to sell up to 36.8% more shares. Assuming it exercises the option in full at the top end of the price range, the sale could raise up to $6.6 billion before any regular overallotment option is included.\n\nBelgium-based AB InBev would raise up to $4.8 billion without the upsize option.\n\nProceeds will help the company, the world\u2019s largest brewer, reduce debts of more than $100 billion, accumulated following the purchase of rival SABMiller in late 2016.\n\nEven at the low end of the price range, the IPO would be the second biggest globally this year, trailing the $8.1 billion flotation of Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) in May, data from Refinitiv shows.\n\nSo far this year, companies have raised $10.8 billion in IPOs in Hong Kong - well short of the $41 billion raised in New York, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nVALUATION\n\nAB InBev\u2019s revived deal excludes the brewer\u2019s Australian operations, which it agreed to sell to Japan\u2019s Asahi Group (2502.T) for $11 billion shortly after the IPO was shelved.\n\nWithout Australia, a large but mature market, AB InBev\u2019s Asia-Pacific operations would be more focused on faster growth markets such as China, India and Vietnam, which could make it easier to achieve a higher valuation, sources have said.\n\nAB InBev blamed market conditions, among other factors, for shelving the previous IPO attempt. But sources involved in the deal said investors were unwilling to accept the company\u2019s valuation for Budweiser APAC.\n\nThe IPO price range for the business, whose portfolio of more than 50 beer brands includes Stella Artois and Corona, equates to a market capitalization of $45.6 billion-$50.7 billion, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the draft prospectus filed earlier this month, Budweiser APAC booked first-quarter normalized earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $558 million, up 23% from a year earlier.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Portfolio beer brands of Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd are displayed during a news conference on the company's IPO in Hong Kong, China July 4, 2019.
