She wasn\u2019t done, teeing off on former Green Party candidate Jill Stein:\n\n\u201c[Jill Stein\u2019s] also a Russian asset\u2026 Yeah, she\u2019s a Russian asset \u2014 I mean, totally. They know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate.\u201d\n\nShe went on to talk about Donald Trump:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what Putin has on him, whether it\u2019s both personal and financial \u2026 I assume it is.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton is nuts. She\u2019s also not far from the Democratic Party mainstream, which has been pushing the same line for years.\n\nLess than a week before Clinton\u2019s outburst, the New York Times \u2014 once a symbol of stodgy, hyper-cautious reporting \u2014 ran a feature called, \u201cWhat, Exactly, is Tulsi Gabbard Up To?\u201d The piece speculated about the \u201csuspicious activity\u201d surrounding Gabbard\u2019s campaign, using quotes from the neoconservative think-tank, the Alliance For Securing Democracy, to speculate about Gabbard\u2019s Russian support.\n\nThis was the second such article the Times had written. An August piece, \u201cTulsi Gabbard thinks we\u2019re doomed,\u201c hit nearly all the same talking points, quoting Clint Watts, an ex-spook from the same think-tank, calling Gabbard \u201cthe Kremlin\u2019s preferred Democrat\u201d and a \u201cuseful agent of influence.\u201d The Times article echoed earlier pieces by the Daily Beast and NBC.com that said many of the same things.\n\nAfter Clinton gave the \u201cRussian asset\u201d interview, it seemed for a moment like America\u2019s commentariat might tiptoe away from the topic. Hillary Clinton has been through a lot over the course of a career, and even detractors would say she\u2019s earned latitude to go loonybiscuits every now and then. A few of the Democratic presidential candidates, like Beto O\u2019Rourke and Andrew Yang, gently chided Clinton for her remarks. But when Gabbard (who\u2019s similarly been through a brutal media ordeal) snapped back and called Hillary \u201cQueen of the warmongers,\u201d and Donald Trump followed by calling Clinton \u201ccrazy,\u201d most pundits doubled down on the \u201casset\u201d idea.\n\nNeoconservative-turned-#Resistance hero David Frum blasted Trump for defending Stein and Gabbard, noting sarcastically, \u201cHe was supposed to pretend they were not all on the same team.\u201d Ana Navarro on CNN said, \u201cWhen both the Russians and Trump support someone, be wary.\u201d An MSNBC panel noted, in apparent seriousness, that Gabbard \u201cnever denied being a Russian asset.\u201d CNN media critic Brian Stelter tried to suggest Hillary only seemed wacko thanks to a trick of the red enemy, saying, \u201cIt feels like a disinformation situation where the Russians want this kind of disinformation.\u201d\n\n(The \u201cRussians caused us to say that crazy thing about Russians\u201d meme has been a recurring theme. When Luke Harding of The Guardian was criticized for a thinly-sourced report that Julian Assange had met with Trump aide Paul Manafort in the Ecuadorian embassy, an anonymous CIA official penned an editorial in Politico suggesting that if the story was fake, \u201cthe most logical explanation\u201d was a Russian disinformation effort to discredit journalists.)\n\nEveryone is foreign scum these days. Democrats spent three years trying to prove Donald Trump is a Russian pawn. Mitch McConnell is \u201cMoscow Mitch.\u201d Third party candidates are a Russian plot. The Bernie Sanders movement is not just a wasteland of racist and misogynist \u201cBros,\u201d but \u2014 according to intelligence agencies and mainstream pundits alike \u2014 the beneficiary of an ambitious Russian plot to \u201cstoke the divide\u201d within the Democratic Party. The Joe Rogan independents attracted to the mild antiwar message of Tulsi Gabbard are likewise traitors and dupes for the Kremlin.\n\nIf you\u2019re keeping score, that\u2019s pretty much the whole spectrum of American political thought, excepting MSNBC Democrats. What a coincidence!\n\nDemocrats now are assuming the role once played by Republicans of the Tom Delay era, who denounced everyone opposed to the War on Terror as \u201cSaddam-lovers.\u201d In the midst of this in 2003, the Washington Post protested the way American journalism was \u201cinfected with jingoism and intolerance.\u201d That was after Rupert Murdoch\u2019s New York Post ran a headline, \u201cDon\u2019t aid these Saddam-lovers\u201d about \u201cappeasement-loving celebs\u201d like Laurence Fishburne, Tim Robbins, Samuel L. Jackson, Sean Penn, Danny Glover, and Susan Sarandon.\n\nToday, the New York Post is the paper crying out against the \u201csad, sick conspiracy theories\u201d about Gabbard (an \u201cAssad-lover\u201d instead of a \u201cSaddam-lover\u201d), but some of the other players are the same. Sarandon is regularly denounced now by Democrats instead of Republicans, this time for having supported Stein in 2016, an act seen as equivalent to having tongue-kissed Putin on live TV. She was also one of a handful of celebrities noted for a \u201ccontroversial\u201d political donation in the Daily Beast\u2019s red-baiting May article about the suspicious contributors to Gabbard\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe #Resistance has come up with all sorts of words for such fifth-columnists and deviationists: they are \u201cfalse-balancers\u201d or \u201cfalse equivalencers,\u201d \u201cneo-Naderites,\u201d \u201cpurity-testers,\u201d \u201cboth-sidesists,\u201d \u201cwhataboutists,\u201d \u201chorseshoe theorists,\u201d \u201cRussia skeptics\u201d or \u201cRussia denialists,\u201d and \u201canti-anti-Trumpers.\u201d Such heretics are all ultimately seen as being on \u201cteam Putin.\u201d\n\nThis witch-hunting insanity isn\u2019t just dangerous, it\u2019s a massive breach from reality. Trump\u2019s campaign was a clown show. He had almost no institutional backing. His \u201cground game\u201d was nonexistent: his \u201ccampaign\u201d was a TV program based almost wholly around unscripted media appearances. Trump raised just over half the $1.2 billion Hillary pulled in (making him the first presidential candidate dating back to 1976 to win with a funds deficit). He didn\u2019t prepare a victory speech, for the perfectly logical reason that he never expected to win.\n\nEven if you posit the most elaborate theories of Russian interference (which I don\u2019t, but of course I\u2019m denialist scum), what happened in 2016 was still almost entirely a domestic story, with Trump benefiting from long-developing public rejection of the political establishment.\n\nRather than confront the devastating absurdity of defeat before an ad-libbing game show host who was seemingly trying to lose \u2013 a black comedy that is 100% in America\u2019s rich stupidity tradition \u2013 Democrats have gone all-in on this theory of foreign infiltration. House speaker Nancy Pelosi even said as much in a White House meeting, pointing at Trump and proclaiming: \u201cAll roads lead to Putin.\u201d\n\nAll? Seriously?
