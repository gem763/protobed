This would have hugely impaired the animal from feeding or swimming normally, and likely led to an exhausting last few hours of life. Based on the flank bruising and lungs, it appears this creature live stranded and drowned in the surfline.\u201d\n\nWriting on Facebook, Smass warned abandoned fishing gear poses a deadly threat to cetaceans.\n\n\u201cEntanglement in nets and fishing lines is a growing global concern and this case highlights that entanglement risk in these species is not just from rope \u2013 lost, abandoned or discarded nets also represent a significant hazard to marine life,\u201d the organisation said.\n\n\u201cIn this case, entanglement cost the lives of two animals \u2013 the mother and her unborn, female calf. This further demonstrates why such interactions can be both tragic at an individual level and potentially a risk to the population. Of course there are situations where gear is lost by accident of misfortune, but, where it isn\u2019t, there is just no excuse for wilfully throwing this stuff overboard.\u201d\n\nThe death of the whale follows a better outcome for another whale also caught in fishing nets off the coast of Orkney the same week.\n\nIn that case a humpback whale was accidentally caught, and the fisherman alerted a rescue team who successfully disentangled the animal.\n\nAnother humpback whale which was seen entering the Thames estuary in south east England earlier this week was later found dead.", "description": "A pregnant whale has been found dead on a beach in the Scottish islands of Orkney with the remains of abandoned fishing gear entangled in its mouth.
