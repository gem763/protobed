Thanks to his policies, American families are more prosperous than ever before.\n\nReal median household income in the U.S. \u2013 a reliable measure of middle-class prosperity \u2013 eclipsed $65,000 in July for the first time ever.\n\nRemarkably, median household income has increased by more than $4,000 since Trump\u2019s inauguration, meaning that the president\u2019s pro-growth policies managed to grow the income of middle America by 6.8 percent in less than three years.\n\nROSE SOMMA TENNENT: TRUMP\u2019S ECONOMY HAS DELIVERED REAL RESULTS FOR WOMEN. FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS ARE PROOF\n\nThat accomplishment is even more impressive when compared to the disastrous economic record of President Barack Obama, who was only able to raise incomes by a fraction of that amount over the course of a much longer timespan.\n\nUnder Obama, median household income only grew by about $1,000 between the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009 and Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017.\n\nThe contrast dramatically underscores the extent to which government policy affects the day-to-day lives of ordinary Americans.\n\nObama\u2019s heavy-handed, big-government approach to economic policy produced a disappointing jobless \u201crecovery\u201d from the Great Recession.\n\nTrump achieved the lowest unemployment rate in half a century \u2013 as well as the fastest wage growth in over a decade \u2013 by removing obstacles to the success of American workers and businesses.\n\nTrump\u2019s most high-profile economic policy accomplishment, of course, is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which saved the average taxpayer about $1,400 on federal income taxes last year. Notably, that\u2019s in addition to the $4,144 increase in pre-tax incomes, meaning today\u2019s workers have an average of an extra $5,500 in their bank accounts as a result of the Trump presidency.\n\nEqually important, however, have been his less-noticed successes, such as slashing the burdensome and unnecessary federal regulations that proliferated under Obama and stifled entrepreneurialism in this country.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nMore impressive still, Trump has achieved all this despite relentless obstruction by the Democratic Party, which has been so obsessed with undermining his presidency that his signature tax cut bill passed Congress without a single Democratic vote \u2013 even though that one piece of legislation provided more economic benefits to middle-income Americans than Obama\u2019s entire presidency.\n\nAfter a decade of stagnation, President Trump has finally restored prosperity to America\u2019s middle class \u2013 returning it to its rightful place as the engine of our economy and the envy of the world.\n\nOf course, Trump\u2019s unprecedented success in empowering the millions of formerly forgotten Americans who had been ignored for so long by the political establishment is precisely what makes him a political target in Washington. The Democrats are more concerned with winning the 2020 presidential election than with enhancing the well-being of working Americans.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThat much is undeniable in light of the fact that virtually every Democratic presidential candidate is vowing to repeal the full range of President Trump\u2019s rejuvenating economic policies and replace them with radical, big-government initiatives. These initiatives are taken straight from the Marxist playbook of unabashed socialists such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nThe future of the great American middle class is in our hands. Prior to President Trump, it had been decades since working Americans had a true champion in the White House, and it could be decades more before another one comes along. We simply can\u2019t afford to miss out on the opportunity for four more years of progress in the strong and growing Trump economy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MIKE HUCKABEE", "description": "President Trump is a true champion of the middle class.
