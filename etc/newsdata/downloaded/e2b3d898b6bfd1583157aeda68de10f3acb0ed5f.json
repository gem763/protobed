An innocent paperwork lapse just after having a child shouldn't bring a penalty of losing tens of thousands of pounds in old age. We called for the following at the launch of the campaign: - Full backdating of state pension credits for those who claim child benefit late; - A review of how credits are awarded, including the feasibility of signing up when registering a birth not via child benefit; - An overhaul of credit swaps between couples following mistakes on child benefit forms - HMRC has since changed the system for parents trying correct these errors.\n\nAnother former Pensions Minister, Ros Altmann, who also supports the backdating of credits, says: 'I'm delighted to see the OTS calling for these injustices in our tax system to be remedied.\n\n'Denying state pensions to mothers who are ineligible for child benefit is clearly wrong.'\n\n'It is great to see the OTS backing up the This is Money's campaign to right these wrongs.'\n\nThe Government has claimed it's too hard to verify evidence for child benefit claims older than three months, as entitlement relies on being responsible for a child each week, and so credits are never backdated further than that.\n\nThis stance is dubbed 'ludicrous' and 'a nonsense' by critics, who believe in the majority of cases it will be obvious parents were in charge of their children at the times in question.\n\nA Government spokesperson said in response to the OTS report: 'We want to get tax right for everyone so we make our guidance as clear and transparent as possible while providing a wide range of information through channels such as web chats and twitter.\n\n'Our written guidance to all new mums urges families to claim child benefit, even when eligible for the High Income Child Benefit Charge, so that no one misses out on important National Insurance contributions.' A previous and fuller explanation of its position is here.\n\nWhy you must apply for child benefit you're not entitled to to get state pension credits\n\nThe confusion over child benefit claims stems from a controversial overhaul six years ago.\n\nThis reduced the entitlement for those earning \u00a350,000-plus a year, or wiped it out entirely for those earning \u00a360,000-plus - something officially known as the High Income Child Benefit Charge.\n\nBut parents who earn too much to qualify for child benefit still have to apply for it, and tick a box to say they don't want the payments, so that they receive state pension credits but avoid having to fill in a tax return.\n\nEach annual credit is worth 1/35 of the value of the state pension \u2013 around \u00a3251 per year or \u00a35,020 over the course of a typical 20-year retirement.\n\nResearch among parents carried out by HMRC found parents are baffled - and gutted - to discover child benefit errors can damage their state pension, and don't comprehend any obvious link between the two systems.\n\nHave you lost state pension by not signing up for child benefits or filling form in wrong? If this has happened to you, contact tanya.jefferies@thisismoney.co.uk and tell us your story.\n\nHMRC only interviewed mums for the study, explaining: 'Only expectant mothers (not fathers) were included because we found they were more engaged with the child benefit claim process.'\n\nThis is despite many fathers filling in the forms, often to take the pressure off partners after children are born.\n\nThat can lead to a separate problem - which affects less well off families who qualify for child benefit as well - where the 'wrong' partner signs up for child benefit, because they are working so the credits are worthless to them.\n\nThe OTS also flagged up this issue in its report, and suggested a revamp of the child benefit form, although it was overhauled last May in an effort to make it clearer.\n\n'All this can easily be confusing for parents, and there have been numerous complaints about the process, and comments in the national media,' it says.\n\n'One reason for this is that the process appears illogical. It could be more helpful (both in the claim form and the guidance on GOV.UK) to explain the benefits of making a claim before going on to cover the option not to receive payments, if the claimant wishes to ensure there will not be a HICBC.'\n\nThe OTS says the wider significance of making a child benefit claim may not be immediately obvious, given that 'benefits and tax are unlikely to be the first thing on new parents\u2019 minds'.\n\nAnd it adds: 'It is unreasonable that the way the linkages in the system work mean people can easily disadvantage themselves, especially if they cannot correct this later.'\n\nThe OTS also points out that some parents have been unwittingly caught out by tax penalties, because they failed to realise they shouldn't receive child benefit. This is Money recently covered the case of a family who faced a shock demand to stump up nearly \u00a310,000 within a month.\n\nChild benefit claims falling: Number of parents signing up has dropped since the Government announced its overhaul of the system (Source: Office of Tax Simplification)\n\nWhat do pension experts say?\n\n'The OTS has highlighted the shortcomings of the system, which it rightly calls \"confusing\", \"unreasonable\" and \"illogical\",' says Catherine McKinnell MP, interim chair of the Treasury Committee.\n\n'It\u2019s good to see that the OTS agrees with the committee\u2019s long-standing recommendation that the Government must do more to make sure that people are aware of the issue and know how to put it right.'\n\nShe went on: 'The Treasury Committee has long warned that the introduction of the High Income Child Benefit Charge could have stark implications.\n\n'Many people may have been affected by this, and in different ways. For example, at the committee\u2019s bidding, HMRC revealed that 200,000 people may be missing National Insurance credits due to the fact that the higher earner is claiming the credits. Others may have simply dropped out of the system.'\n\nA sleep deprived new parent is presented with reams of new responsibility and information. A child benefit claim form of seven pages with 78 questions is overwhelming Jon Greer, Quilter\n\nJon Greer, head of retirement policy at Quilter, says: 'The counter-intuitive nature of claiming child benefit has been highlighted numerous times and now the Government\u2019s independent evaluator is joining the fight .\n\n'The OTS\u2019s report highlights the child benefit system means people can \"easily disadvantage themselves\" and is \"illogical\".\n\n'A sleep deprived overwhelmed new parent is presented with reams of new responsibility and information. A child benefit claim form of seven pages with 78 questions is overwhelming, particularly when it\u2019s less than clear if you need to fill it in and how you are supposed to do it.'\n\nTom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell, says parents on a higher earnings threshold often think they don\u2019t need to bother claiming child benefit, but then miss out on crucial National Insurance contributions.\n\n'As it\u2019s often the mother who is off work with the child, it means they miss out on entitlement to the state pension, further exacerbating the gender pension gap.\n\n'It\u2019s good the OTS have identified that it\u2019s \"unreasonable\" the system works in this way and that individuals can unfairly miss out on vital state pension in later life because they haven\u2019t claimed the benefit.\n\n'The suggestion people should be able to claim back NI credits if they\u2019ve missed out is common sense and the Government should reform the system to ensure that people understand the implications of not claiming child benefit.'\n\nSean McCann, chartered financial planner at NFU Mutual, points out that a parent can face a hidden tax bill if they find a new partner.\n\nAnyone with an income of more than \u00a350,000 who moves in with someone who has children and is claiming child benefit may trigger an unexpected tax bill even though they are not their children, he explains.\n\n'This little-known quirk is probably the last thing on anyone\u2019s mind when they move in with a new partner.\n\n'If you have a higher income than your partner and it exceeds \u00a350,000 the onus is on you to tell HMRC and pay the tax bill. For some this runs into thousands of pounds.'\n\nHMRC defines \u2018partner\u2019 as someone you\u2019re married to, in a civil partnership with, or living with as if you were, says McCann.", "description": "In a stinging report, tax officials said people 'can easily disadvantage themselves' in a system that 'appears illogical', and told the Government to find a way to restore lost credits to parents.", "authors": ["Tanya Jefferies For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
