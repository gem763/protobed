How can I politely keep my distance without being unduly rude.\n\nI am an only child and my father beat me. My mother insisted that we had to accept it; he earned a lot of money and she liked the lifestyle we had. When I came out as gay, he cut off contact with me, and we are not in touch. He has never met or acknowledged my wife and our children. My mother divorced him only recently.\n\nI have been quite resentful towards her for not defending me, but I have tried to accept that it must have been hard for her, too. He was her first boyfriend, and she had been trained by her own parents to support her husband.\n\nI live in a different country from where I grew up, and I like the distance. The problem is that my mother emails me many times a day, constantly asking questions. I only respond once a day, but she complains when I don\u2019t reply. She also says I only give her \u201ccrumbs\u201d.\n\nShe has a lot more money than we do and uses it to try to bribe me. She\u2019ll offer to pay for us to visit, or to leave us money in her will, but only if I take care of her in old age. I don\u2019t feel the money is worth the stress, but equally I don\u2019t want my children to lose out on having a potentially easier life.\n\nAfter speaking to a specialist, psychoanalytic psychotherapist Helen Morgan (bpc.org.uk), I realised how many parallels there are between you and your mother \u2013 before you panic, let me explain. She put up with her husband because of money, and that\u2019s similar to what you\u2019re doing with her. You say she was trained to be supportive of her husband, and I think you\u2019ve been trained to be supportive of your mother, no matter what. Your mother made excuses for your father; you\u2019re doing the same with her.\n\nMorgan pointed out that your family is one of \u201cco-dependency, where people go along with things; where bad behaviour isn\u2019t confronted, it\u2019s colluded with\u201d. Morgan was also struck by your use of the word \u201cpolite\u201d. She said: \u201cIt may be necessary to really face how furious you are with your mother and what was done to you as a child, and that\u2019s not polite.\u201d\n\nYou have every right to be angry with your mother, but it\u2019s not easy, is it? It was easier with your father because of the abuse, but with your mother, something keeps you enmeshed, hopeful, not resolute. If you could, without fear of consequence, what would you really say to your mother? Perhaps you should write it down. I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t let yourself go there, because it must be painful.\n\nIn every tricky relationship where we stay, there\u2019s a hook: usually love, money, guilt or hope. Here, there\u2019s all four. I wonder if your children will look back and say of you: \u201cMum stayed because of the money,\u201d just as you are saying about your own mother? You\u2019re absolutely not your mother; your longer letter showed compassion, empathy, thought \u2013 all things your mother seems to be lacking \u2013 but it is something to think about.\n\nYou can let things stay as they are, with your mother trying to get to you, and you trying to keep a distance, or you could tell her what you\u2019re not prepared to put up with and what the consequences will be if she breaches those conditions. But I think you fear that such a conversation will be catastrophic, and that she might break with you.\n\nShould my partner use our money to subsidise his adult sons? Read more\n\nMorgan suggested you examine what you are fearful of, and what\u2019s driving you to keep contact. Only you can answer these things; only you can decide what the boundaries are \u2013 but you must know in your heart that your mother is never going to fundamentally change.\n\nYou moved far away and you talk of distance a great deal. I see this a lot in dysfunctional family relationships, but, as Morgan pointed out: \u201cYou don\u2019t need a distance if an ordinary separation has taken place.\u201d This separation isn\u2019t ordinary, it\u2019s bedded in trauma, dysfunction and pain. You are not a bad person for wanting to have a good life.\n\n\u2022 Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.
