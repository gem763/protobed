Press Office Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador/Handout via REUTERS\n\nGuerrero state public security spokesman Roberto Alvarez said 14 civilians and one soldier died in the shootout in the municipality of Tepochica, near Iguala, a city notorious for the 2014 disappearances of 43 student teachers.\n\nA photograph of the aftermath seen by Reuters showed two slain civilians, one of them hanging limply off the side of a battered pick-up truck that had been riddled with bullets as security forces patrolled the area.\n\nDefending his security strategy after suspected cartel gunmen killed 13 police a day earlier in the neighboring western state of Michoacan, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador blamed past administrations for Mexico\u2019s chronic violence.\n\nHowever, the latest carnage is likely to increase pressure on Lopez Obrador to get a grip on a problem he pledged to tackle when he took office last December.\n\nGuerrero and Michoacan are two of Mexico\u2019s most violent and lawless states, where rival drug gangs have battled to control smuggling routes to the Pacific and interior of the country.\n\nThe leftist Lopez Obrador told a news conference the ambush in Michoacan was \u201cvery regrettable\u201d but reiterated that his commitment to greater spending on security and fighting the root causes of violence would eventually pay dividends.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic we\u2019ll secure peace ... we\u2019re completely dedicated to this issue, but (past governments) allowed it to grow,\u201d said Lopez Obrador, who has criticized past efforts for taking a confrontational approach to battling crime.\n\nHomicides in Mexico this year are on track to surpass last year\u2019s record.\n\nPhotos of the Michoacan crime scene on social media showed bullet-riddled police vehicles set on fire, as well as bodies of dead officers on the ground.\n\nAfter taking office, Lopez Obrador created a militarized National Guard police force to contain the violence.\n\nBut many of the National Guard have instead been deployed to police Mexico\u2019s borders to placate U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened to impose tariffs if Lopez Obrador does not reduce the flow of U.S.-bound migrants from Central America.\n\nThe city of Iguala pitched Mexico\u2019s chronic security problems into the glare of international media after the 43 trainee teachers were abducted by a drug gang in cahoots with corrupt local police on the night of Sept. 26, 2014.\n\nThe resulting scandal battered the reputation of Mexico\u2019s former president and helped propel Lopez Obrador into office.\n\nThe last government said the drug gang killed and incinerated the youths, although investigators only ever definitively identified the remains of one of them.", "description": "A gunfight between security forces and armed civilians in Mexico's southwestern state of Guerrero killed 15 people on Tuesday, authorities said, the second mass killing to shake the country in as many days.", "authors": ["Lizbeth Diaz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441165355&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1GI", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
