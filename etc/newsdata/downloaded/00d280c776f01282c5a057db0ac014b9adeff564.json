(Stephen Lam/Reuters)\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has gotten considerable grief for how it has managed and organized the party\u2019s presidential candidate debates this cycle; some of that criticism is deserved, and some is undeserved. Many of the less compelling complaints come from candidates and their supporters who object to having any participation threshold at all. They argue that somehow declaring as a candidate and filing the right papers entitles a candidate to appear on prime-time national television \u2014 irrespective of whether that candidate has any measurable level of support in the Democratic electorate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring this cycle, 26 Democrats of varying prominence have declared bids. There is no good debate format to spotlight 26 individual candidates. The DNC was generous by allowing 20 candidates to participate in the first two two-night debates. They\u2019ve got to set up some threshold, and polling support and total number of donors seem as fair as any.\n\nHaving said that, when billionaire Tom Steyer is up on the debate stage tonight and several serious-minded senators and governors are not, viewers can fairly ask what the heck is going on. Other Democratic candidates have explicitly accused Steyer of buying his way onto the debate stage. Per the Sacramento Bee: \u201cIn an email to supporters, former Texas Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke said Steyer has \u2018succeeded in buying his way up there.\u2019 New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker wrote to supporters in a fundraising email that Steyer\u2019s \u2018ability to spend millions of his personal wealth has helped him gain in the polls like no one else in this race.\u2019\u201d\n\nSteyer has spent $20 million on television ads \u2014 boosting his name ID and poll support above that oh-so-high 2 percent threshold \u2014 and he\u2019s collected donations from more than 165,000 individuals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTonight, many Americans will get their first look at Tom Steyer, and while there\u2019s always the chance he surprises us, the odds are good that by the end of the night, viewers at home will wonder if he won his spot on the debate stage in some sort of auction or perhaps through the Make-a-Wish Foundation. If Tom Steyer did not exist, cynical conservatives would have to invent him as the embodiment of hilariously self-absorbed, hypocritical elitists who believe in wildly impractical happy-talk theories and who have only the vaguest notion of what the U.S. Constitution says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteyer is a billionaire hedge-fund manager who told the New York Times that he doesn\u2019t think of himself as rich. At his hedge fund, Steyer helped \u201cwealthy investors move their money through an offshore company to help shield their gains from U.S. taxes.\u201d Back in 2005, he invested $34 million in Corrections Corporation of America, \u201cwhich runs migrant detention centers on the U.S.-Mexico border for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\u201d Steyer says he regrets that past investment.\n\nHe\u2019s an ardent environmentalist and climate-change activist who made part of his fortune in coal development projects. He has spent tens of millions of dollars on political ads because he wants to \u201cget corporate money out of politics.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if he has other controversial investments, because he \u201cdeclined to go into detail about significant segments of his investment portfolio, citing confidentiality agreements that bar him from publicly disclosing the underlying assets in which he is invested.\u201d (Steyer believes President Trump has violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution because \u201chas directly profited from dealing with foreign governments through his businesses in the U.S. and around the globe.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn January, he declared that he would be \u201cdedicating 100 percent of my time, money and effort to one cause: working for Mister Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal from office. I am not running for president at this time. Instead I am strengthening my commitment to Need to Impeach in 2019.\u201d But by July \u2014 well before House speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the beginning of impeachment proceedings \u2014 he changed his mind and decided to run.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause he believes President Trump is such a danger to our democracy and the Constitution, Steyer wants to decide issues by national referendums, to enact congressional term limits and nationwide vote-by-mail, and to expand the size of the Supreme Court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe believes that he can demonstrate a new alternative to traditional agriculture, utilizing \u201cunconventional eco-theories about holistic management and nature-based grazing.\u201d He\u2019s spent $10 million, and so far demonstrated that the methods, while innovative, are not cost-effective for those who have to make a living at farming.\n\nNow on the campaign trail, Steyer is prone to hyperbole such as, \u201cIf they win, literally it could be the end of the world.\u201d Literally!\n\nEven most Democrats who agree with Steyer\u2019s positions exhibit a certain weariness about his candidacy, as he looks like a bored billionaire Democratic-party donor who\u2019s dabbled in politics, doesn\u2019t really know much about how government works, shoots from the hip, falls in love with every crazy idea he hears, and is willing to throw around about a hundred million to hold rallies and hear people cheering him.
