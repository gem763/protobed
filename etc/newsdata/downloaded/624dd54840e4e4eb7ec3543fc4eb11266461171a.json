But he is a fantastic player and to be in your fifth World Cup is a massive achievement for a man that I really look up to.\u201d\n\nVermeulen was rested for the Boks\u2019 57-3 victory over Namibia in their last outing but returns for what is essentially a knockout fixture.\n\nWhile he is \u201cmentally fresh\u201d, Vermeulen found it difficult watching from the stands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to sit on the sidelines and watch. You always want to be a part of it. But you can still contribute, you run the plays of the opposition, you give the team the best chance to be as prepared as they can when they hit the field.\n\n\u201cWe did a bit of off-field work, but yeah, I am mentally fresh and ready to go this week.\u201d\n\nVermeulen has backed the inclusion of lock Lood de Jager ahead of Franco Mostert in a changed Bok pack from that which started the 23-13 defeat to New Zealand in their opening match.\n\nCoach Rassie Erasmus is expecting a tense forward battle in what could be wet conditions and his selection of De Jager over the more mobile Mostert is a sign of this.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to lineouts, he knows what he wants to do and he has been put there for a certain reason. He is a tall guy and also gives you a bit of extra weight in the scrum, as well as the mauls,\u201d Vermeulen says.\n\n\u201cHe has improved a lot in some of the small things around the maul time. In the last game against Namibia he really impressed and had a massive game, so hopefully he can do it again. He is a good leader.\u201d", "description": "Powerful South Africa number eight Duane Vermeulen is itching to tackle one of his role-models in Italy captain Sergio Parisse when the sides meet in a must-win Rugby World Cup Pool B encounter at the Shizuoka Stadium on Friday.", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436069795&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9102A", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
