Here's everything you need to know:\n\nWhat is the meaning of Reiwa?\n\nThe name of Japan's new imperial era was announced during a news conference by chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nThe name consists of two characters, which were presented by Suga on a white placard.\n\nThe first character in the name means \"order\" or \"command\", while the second means \"peace\" or \"harmony\", Reuters reports.\n\nDuring the news conference, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe stated: \"The name Reiwa means that culture is born and grows when people come together and care for each other beautifully.\"\n\nHow was the name Reiwa chosen?\n\nThe names of Japanese eras are usually taken from ancient Chinese texts.\n\nThe previous era Heisei, for example, was given its name from two Chinese history and philosophy books, former chief cabinet secretary and prime minister Keizo Obuchi announced when the era began.\n\nReiwa departs from tradition, as its name has taken inspiration from an ancient collection of Japanese poetry called the Manyoshu.\n\nThe 7th century Manyoshu is the oldest existing collection of Japanese poetry.\n\n\"It is a collection which expresses our nation's rich culture, which we should take pride in, along with our nation's beautiful nature,\" Abe said of the Japanese poetry collection.\n\n\"We believe this national character should be passed along to the next era.\"\n\nHow will the new era affect everyday life in Japan?\n\nWhen unveiling then name of the new imperial era, Suga explained how he hopes Reiwa will positively impact the Japanese nation.\n\n\"We hope it will be widely accepted by the people and deeply rooted as part of their daily lives,\" he said.\n\nWhile Japan uses the western Gregorian calendar, the country also denotes the year by using the name of the current imperial era.\n\nTherefore, when Reiwa officially begins on Wednesday 1 May, 2019 will also become known as \"Reiwa 1\".\n\nThe era name will be used on official documents, coins, calendars and newspapers.", "description": "In April, the name of Japan's new imperial era was announced.
