But the story is inextricably linked to Biden\u2019s son, pushing one of the topics that Biden is least comfortable discussing into the spotlight.\n\nThe challenge of taking advantage of this political moment without becoming ensnared was evident by how Biden responded to the news Friday afternoon. First, he reacted defensively in an exchange with reporters in Iowa. Then later, in a formal statement from his campaign, he forcefully denounced Trump\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cNot one single credible outlet has given any credibility to his assertions. Not one single one,\u201d Biden told reporters in Iowa on Friday afternoon, referring to the allegations related to his son, after initially ignoring shouted questions.\n\n\u201cAnd so I have no comment,\u201d he said. \u201cExcept the president should start to, uh, be president.\u201d\n\n\n\nViktor Shokin was Ukraine\u2019s general prosecutor. Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani has suggested that Biden improperly used his influence to get Ukraine to dismiss Shokin in 2016. (Sergei Chuzavkov/AP)\n\nHe brushed aside further questions about whether Trump had abused his power.\n\nBut two hours later, Biden\u2019s campaign released a written statement that was far more robust. While his initial response was to defend his family\u2019s honor, his second statement focused on Trump\u2019s behavior.\n\nHe said that Trump\u2019s \u201cclear-cut corruption damages and diminishes our institutions of government by making them tools of a personal political vendetta.\u201d He also called on Trump to release the transcript of the call in question.\n\n\u201cThis behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,\u201d Biden said in the statement. \u201cIt means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation \u2014 a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia \u2014 pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor.\u201d\n\nThe heightened scrutiny of Trump\u2019s interactions with the Ukrainian leader, and efforts by congressional Democrats to investigate it, thrust the 2020 campaign into uncertain terrain \u2014 for Trump and Biden, who leads the polls in a crowded Democratic primary field.\n\nWhen Biden first entered the presidential race, it triggered a burst of attention on Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business ties and made-for-tabloid lifestyle.\n\nThe Biden campaign had hoped it had dispatched with some of those questions.\n\nThat won\u2019t be so easy if House Democrats move toward impeachment proceedings. While the hearings would focus on Trump\u2019s behavior, House Republicans would also amplify questions over Biden\u2019s actions while he was in office.\n\nSeveral Democratic presidential candidates on Friday condemned Trump without mentioning Biden. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) renewed calls for his impeachment and said \u201cby failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump\u2019s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections.\u201d Gov. Steve Bullock (Mont.) called it \u201cbehavior you\u2019d expect from an incompetent mobster.\u201d\n\nBut the news also comes at a time when some of Biden\u2019s Democratic rivals are growing increasingly desperate to gain traction, and shedding some of their unwillingness to attack him forcefully. And while some may rally behind Biden for what they view as an unfair \u2014 and potentially illegal \u2014 targeting of a fellow Democrat, it could lead others to question whether he is best fit to counter Trump.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out there every day criticizing Trump and saying it\u2019s the most corrupt administration in the history of America,\u201d said Grant Woodard, an attorney and longtime Iowa Democratic consultant unaligned with a candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be problematic for Biden to have to answer those questions about himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s true or not, the fact that you have to deal with it is problematic. It\u2019s a distraction they don\u2019t want,\u201d he added. \u201cThey want to create the narrative, \u2018I can win, I can take on Trump, don\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good in terms of ideological fights.\u2019 This is the stuff they don\u2019t want to be talking about.\u201d\n\nBiden allies, meanwhile, hope that elevating the case surrounding Hunter Biden will dispel the notion that he did anything wrong.\n\nIt also serves as a vivid example of how worried Trump is about Biden\u2019s prospects in a general election. On Friday night, Biden sent out a fundraising email saying, \u201cDonald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate me and my family.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has spent months focused on Biden\u2019s family, attempting to cast the former senator and vice president as a lifelong politician whose family has been personally enriched off his powerful positions.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani has suggested that Biden improperly used his influence to get Ukraine to dismiss its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. The prosecutor general\u2019s office had opened an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a national gas company on whose board Hunter Biden had a position starting in April 2014.\n\nBiden traveled to Ukraine in March 2016 and said the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless Shokin was removed.\n\nThe push was part of a wider effort \u2014 which involved other Western allies as well as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank \u2014 to remove Shokin, who was viewed as corrupt.\n\n\u201cWe found no evidence to support the idea that Joe Biden advocated with his son\u2019s interests in mind,\u201d PolitiFact wrote in May. \u201cIt\u2019s not even clear that the company was actively under investigation or that a change in prosecutors benefited it.\u201d\n\nOne of the reasons Biden took a long time to decide whether to get into the presidential race was over considerations of the attacks on his family that not only come under the bright lights of a national campaign but also from the bullying tactics that Trump has employed.\n\nIt also comes at a time when his son has become fodder for gossip pages. He divorced his wife amid charges of extramarital affairs, cocaine use and financial problems. He also began dating the widow of his brother, Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015. After their separation, he married a woman in May that he had met a few weeks earlier.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign earlier this year declined to say whether it had done a full vetting of Hunter, which campaigns sometimes do to prevent surprises.\n\nDuring Biden\u2019s announcement speech in Philadelphia, most of Biden\u2019s immediate family appeared onstage with him. Hunter, afraid that being there would be a distraction, did not attend.\n\nHe said during a fundraiser earlier in the year that his grandchildren had urged him to run for president and were cognizant of the amount of scrutiny that would come.\n\n\u201c \u2018Mommy and daddy had a divorce and they\u2019re going to really go after that,\u2019 \u201d Biden recounted hearing from one of his grandchildren. \u201cMy generic point is they know how tough it\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\nBiden was asked last month about the appropriateness of Giuliani\u2019s efforts, and reports that the State Department was cooperating with his efforts to press Ukraine to investigate his son.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about it,\u201d Biden responded. \u201cBut secondly, I think it\u2019s Rudy Giuliani. And it\u2019s the president. And appropriateness has never been the measure they\u2019ve started with.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about concerns of a quid pro quo, Biden demurred.\n\n\u201cI have no idea what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.\n\nHolly Bailey in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, contributed to this report.", "description": "The story is inextricably linked to the Democratic front-runner\u2019s son, pushing one of the topics that Biden is least comfortable discussing into the spotlight.", "authors": ["Matt Viser", "National Political Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/k_OQEMEVI2yJqwypj25ZF6SKVnY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S37KMLW36EI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
