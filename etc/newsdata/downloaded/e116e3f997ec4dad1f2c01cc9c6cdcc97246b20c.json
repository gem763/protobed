That can\u2019t be taken away\u201d.\n\nThe 31-year-old was named as one of three additions to NBC\u2019s marquee show last week, alongside Bowen Yang and Chloe Fineman.\n\nSoon after, podcast footage surfaced of him making racist, homophobic and misogynistic comments.\n\nGillis apologised, saying in a statement he was \u201ca comedian who pushes boundaries\u201d but who \u201csometimes missed\u201d.\n\nDemocratic presidential contender Andrew Yang, who Gillis called a \u201cJew chink\u201d, said he thought the comedian should not be fired.\n\nBut in a statement on Monday, a spokesperson for SNL producer Lorne Michaels said: \u201cAfter talking with Shane Gillis, we have decided that he will not be joining SNL.\n\n\u201cWe want SNL to have a variety of voices and points of view within the show, and we hired Shane on the strength of his talent as a comedian and his impressive audition \u2026 We were not aware of his prior remarks.\n\n\u201cThe language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable. We are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to standard.\u201d\n\nGillis tweeted a statement.\n\n\u201cIt feels ridiculous for comedians to be making serious public statements but here we are,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a comedian who was funny enough to get SNL. That can\u2019t be taken away.\n\n\u201cOf course I wanted an opportunity to prove myself at SNL, but I understand it would be too much of a distraction. I respect the decision they made. I\u2019m honestly grateful for the opportunity. I was always a Mad TV guy anyway.\u201d\n\nAt the weekend, Yang said America would \u201cbenefit from being more forgiving rather than punitive\u201d and added that he would be \u201chappy to sit down and talk\u201d with Gillis.\n\nOn Monday, he said the comedian had \u201creached out. Looks like we will be sitting down together soon.\u201d\n\nThe new season of Saturday Night Live, the 45th, begins on 28 September.", "description": "Move comes after podcast footage surfaced of comedian making racist, homophobic and misogynistic comments", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d77e1a9b71ca7498a35a999f5d44598b4eaab577/0_0_5064_3038/master/5064.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dcffcd254a9aebd059301273f6a1534c", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
