Guthrie True, speaks to the media in Lexington, Ky., on Sept. 12, 2018. (Charles Bertram/AP)\n\nA jury has found the father of Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes guilty of illegally funneling contributions to his daughter\u2019s 2014 campaign against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nThe Lexington Herald-Leader reported Thursday that Jerry Lundergan, former chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party, and Democratic consultant Dale Emmons were convicted on 10 and six counts, respectively. Prosecutors said the two had carried out a scheme to direct more than $200,000 in corporate contributions to Grimes\u2019s campaign in violation of federal election laws, the Herald-Leader reported.\n\nReached by phone, Lundergan referred questions to his legal team.\n\nJ. Guthrie True, a lawyer for Lundergan, said his client plans to appeal.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed in the verdict but we understood from the outset that the deck would be stacked against us with prejudicial evidence that we believe was erroneously admitted,\u201d True said in a statement. He added that Lundergan\u2019s team is \u201cconfident that the campaign finance laws have been improperly applied in this case and that Mr. Lundergan will ultimately be vindicated.\u201d\n\nGrimes\u2019s office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nThe Lundergans are one of the most prominent families in Kentucky Democratic politics. In addition to serving twice as state Democratic Party chairman, Lundergan also served in the Kentucky state House. He has had a long-standing political rivalry with another Kentucky Democratic stalwart, former governor Steve Beshear.\n\nThursday\u2019s verdict is the latest political setback for Grimes, who had been viewed as a rising star in the Democratic Party even after her 2014 loss to McConnell. She was among the speakers at the 2016 Democratic National Convention and sharply criticized Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) for running for reelection at the same time that he pursued a presidential bid.\n\nBut earlier this year, Grimes began to run into trouble. ProPublica and the Herald-Leader published reports detailing accusations of a power grab by Grimes on the state Board of Elections. Grimes\u2019s office also allegedly used the state\u2019s voter registration system for partisan purposes. Grimes has denied the allegations.\n\nGrimes\u2019s office is under investigation by three state agencies, and in March, the Kentucky legislature passed a measure limiting Grimes\u2019s authority over state elections.", "description": "Prosecutors said Jerry Lundergan carried out a scheme to direct more than $200,000 in corporate contributions to his daughter\u2019s 2014 campaign.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/IYEGMOqRJ5ewhgvg9JOs8qPduTE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TJBTUGGVTMI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
