And that didn't make a difference.\"\n\n\"So this argument that some have made to suggest that the answer is more guns, to me, over and over again, not only in El Paso, but time and again, that has been debunked,\" Castro added.\n\nCastro reiterated his claim on his Twitter account.\n\nThe myth of a good guy with a gun has been totally shattered.\n\n\n\nIn Texas\u2014with open carry, concealed carry, campus carry\u2014we\u2019ve had 4 of the deadliest mass shootings in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThe answer is not more guns\u2014it\u2019s common sense gun reform.#2020GunSafety pic.twitter.com/9Ln0DVwRwv \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 2, 2019\n\nThe amount of defensive gun use vary widely.

The Washington Post has reported the number is closer to 100,000 instances each year.\n\nNPR reported a Harvard University analysis of figures from the National Crime Victimization Survey showed people defended themselves with a gun in only 0.9 percent of crimes from 2007 to 2011.", "description": ".10/03/2019 3:23:24AM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/275/09f7e41e-6801-49ec-8bb9-e97e1943be33.png"}
