They are together again and that is some comfort.\n\nDyllon struggled to cope following his sister\u2019s death in December last year\n\n\u2018I think I always knew Dyllon would do this because I knew he couldn\u2019t bear to be without her, but I hoped he could have held on a bit longer. This world is a darker place without them. Our hearts are broken.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuinn was 17 when she was found hanged on December 9 and the death hit the family hard.\n\nDyllon put his studies on hold for a year and took up a job in a cocktail bar, according to the Mirror.\n\nIn the run-up to his death his family set up a charity called Quinn\u2019s Retreat, set up in his sister\u2019s name and giving respite to families of suicide victims.\n\nThere was a fundraiser at which he was the life and soul of the party, buying Jagerbombs for everyone \u2013 including three for his grandmother.\n\nNeed support?
