(Photo by Meg Oliphant/Getty Images)\n\nIf the Dallas Cowboys want to make a coaching change and are looking for a coach who has spent his career in college football, there\u2019s a famous one currently doing TV work who would \u201cabsolutely\u201d listen to their pitch.\n\nFormer Ohio State coach and current Fox analyst Urban Meyer said on Colin Cowherd\u2019s Fox Sports 1 show Friday that he would not shoot down the Cowboys if the franchise approached him. The conversation about Dallas came up when Meyer was talking about Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley and the widespread belief that Riley could be a favorite for the job if the 3-3 Cowboys don\u2019t re-sign Jason Garrett after the season.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cPure speculation because I know him but I don\u2019t know him like that, that\u2019s the one,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cThat\u2019s New York Yankees, that\u2019s the Dallas Cowboys, that\u2019s the one. Great city, you\u2019ve got Dak Prescott, you\u2019ve got Zeke Elliott, loaded team \u2014 I can\u2019t speak for him obviously, I hate to even speculate because I don\u2019t know him, that\u2019s really not fair, but to me that\u2019s the one job in professional football where you kind of say \u2018I gotta go do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nCowherd then asked if Meyer had been contacted by the Cowboys. He said he had not. Cowherd then followed up and asked Meyer if he\u2019d spend \u201ca couple days with it\u201d if the Cowboys did reach out to him.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cAbsolutely. Absolutely. That one? Yes.\u201d\n\nMeyer retired at the end of 2018\n\nWhen he stepped down at Ohio State at the end of the 2018 season, Meyer said that he believed he was done with his coaching career. But this isn\u2019t his first retirement either. He spent the 2011 season doing TV work after leaving Florida following the 2010 campaign. He became Ohio State\u2019s coach before the 2012 season.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeyer left both Florida and Ohio State because of health issues; he dealt with chest pains while at Florida and had headaches \u2014 and even brain surgery in 2014 \u2014 because of an arachnoid cyst while he was at Ohio State.\n\nBut there are many who believe that Meyer could eventually be open to taking another coaching job before his career is officially over. Namely, the one at USC if (or when) the school parts ways with Clay Helton. The NFL hadn\u2019t been mentioned until Meyer did it himself on Friday with a wry smile.\n\nWould he be truly interested if the Cowboys expressed interest? Who knows. But we do know that Meyer could have answered that question in myriad other ways to explicitly show he wasn\u2019t open to coaching again.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Meyer said when he retired at Ohio State that he believed he was done coaching.
