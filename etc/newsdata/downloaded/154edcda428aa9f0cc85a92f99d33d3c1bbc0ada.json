By creating demand for them, we use fewer resources, and get to enjoy dishes like this amazing slow-roast lamb belly\n\nAccording to the UK government\u2019s waste and resources programme, Wrap, as much as 70% of post-farm-gate waste takes place in our homes (the rest comes from manufacturing, hospitality and retail). That\u2019s not all our fault, of course: clever marketing, BOGOF offers and bulk buys all help waste proliferate.\n\nBeyond reducing our own waste, we can also help food producers reduce theirs by changing our shopping habits. The most effective thing we can do is demand producers and retailers take responsibility for their waste by writing emails to them and our MPs; we can also shorten our food chain by wherever possible buying locally and seasonally.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s root-to-fruit eating \u2013 consuming whole foods from the whole farm, including veg such as root greens and lesser-known cuts of meat such as lamb breast, which many butchers literally just throw away. This helps to create a demand for what would normally go to waste, while making our food shop more affordable.\n\nSlow-roasted lamb belly\n\nLamb breast is a dream cut of meat savoured secretly by many chefs, not least because it\u2019s flavoursome, affordable and thrifty \u2013 from the right butcher, you should be able to get it for a really good price.\n\nDo ask them to bone it for you, and take the bones home to help create a sauce for the meat. If you have the bones, make a trivet under the rolled lamb and add a splash of wine to cover them. Pop some potatoes and other vegetables in the oven to roast alongside the belly, to make sure the oven is used to its full capacity.\n\n400g lamb belly, boned\n\n3 sprigs fresh herbs (oregano, thyme, rosemary, etc), tough stalks removed, or a sprinkle of dried herbs\n\n4 garlic cloves, peeled\n\n2 outer cabbage leaves (optional)\n\nSea salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\nRoast potatoes and other vegetables, to serve (optional)\n\nGreen sauce, to serve\n\nHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Lay the lamb breast flat on a worktop, season with salt and scatter with a mixture of fresh or dried herb leaves.\n\nLay the peeled garlic cloves along the centre of the breast, then roll up the lamb into a tight sausage and wrap it in one or two large outer cabbage leaves (or a piece of greaseproof paper).\n\nRoast for 30 minutes, then turn down the heat to 140C (120C fan)/285F/gas 1 and slow roast, with a pan of potatoes and some other vegetables alongside (to fill the oven), for three to four hours, until tender.\n\nServe with the roast veg and green sauce.", "description": "Unbelievably, butchers often throw away less popular cuts of meat.
