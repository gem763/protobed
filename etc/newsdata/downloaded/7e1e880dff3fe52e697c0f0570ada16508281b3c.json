He has pleaded not guilty. Investigators said they have video evidence, MassLive.com reported.\n\nThe star wide-receiver also called out what he apparently sees as the league\u2019s hypocrisy with its treatment of quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who is injured. He pointed out that the Steelers\u2019 quarterback had been accused of sexually assaulting a college student in 2010. He was suspended under the league\u2019s personal conduct policy, the Washington Post reported.\n\n\u201c4 games for Big Ben crazy world I\u2019m done with it,\u201d he tweeted. Roethlisberger is a former teammate. Prosecutors decided not to charge Roethlisberger.\n\nAlready facing a civil suit claiming that he raped a former trainer, Brown was accused in a Sports Illustrated story published on Monday of exposing himself to an artist he hired to paint a mural at his home. He has denied both allegations.\n\nThe NFL said it will continue to investigate Brown\u2019s behavior, as it has with stars like Ray Rice and Kareem Hunt and lesser players who have run afoul of the personal conduct policy \u2014 whether or not they were convicted of a crime, or even charged.\n\nBrown has been sued by a former trainer, who claimed he raped or sexually assaulted her on three occasions.\n\nAccording to a Sports Illustrated story, a second woman, who as a victim of sexual harassment is not being identified, was working at Brown\u2019s home when she turned around to find him standing there naked except for a small towel covering his genitals.\n\nAfter the article ran, the magazine reported, the woman \u201creceived what she characterized as intimidating texts\u201d from Brown that included pictures of her children.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Antonio Brown, the embattled wide receiver who vowed Sunday to never play in the NFL again after being released by the New England Patriots after being accused by a second woman of sexual misconduct, tweeted an African proverb earlier this month that may have been a warning to the league.", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
