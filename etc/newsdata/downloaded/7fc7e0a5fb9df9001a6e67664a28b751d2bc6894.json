I will probably be the underdog, coming through qualifying. I know back home in Australia, we all like underdogs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI hope to bring my best tennis, a physical brand of tennis, and really just give it all for one more match. That\u2019s all I want to do.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 World number one Novak Djokovic on Saturday cruised into the Japan Open final, thrashing David Goffin 6-3, 6-4.
