It came after days of privately huddling with advisers. The steady stream of new revelations and incendiary statements from Trump made it almost impossible for Biden not to take a more fiery stance.\n\nAside from the daily drumbeat of news about Trump\u2019s conduct, Biden also fielded incoming complaints from donors and supporters who wanted to see more aggression out of Biden against the president.\n\n\u201cI believe he\u2019s heard from a lot of people, because I have, that it would be good for him to be stronger against Trump,\u201d said Sheila Nix, who\u2019s on Biden\u2019s national finance council. \u201cIt would be beneficial for him to take charge and define himself and not let Trump define him.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s attacks over the past two weeks haven\u2019t shown much of a dent in the Democrat\u2019s poll numbers, there has been no tangible sign of a rallying effect either.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
