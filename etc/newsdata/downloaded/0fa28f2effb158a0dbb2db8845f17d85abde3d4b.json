About 60 worshippers were at a Yom Kippur service at the time.\n\nAuthorities say the suspect is a German national.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The suspect was filmed wearing a helmet and shooting in a street in Halle\n\nThe video - which has been removed from Twitch - showed him making anti-Semitic and misogynistic comments before driving to the synagogue and shooting at its door.\n\nAfter failing to get into the synagogue, he shot dead two people: a woman in a nearby street and a man inside a kebab shop about 500 metres (yards) away. Two people were also wounded by bullets and underwent surgery.\n\nReports say the gunman also tried to set off explosives at the synagogue.\n\nWitnesses said he was heavily armed, and an online anti-Semitic \"manifesto\" attributed to him shows guns, apparently home-made.\n\nSurvivors say they hid behind the synagogue's heavy locked doors until police arrived, which took more than 10 minutes.\n\n\"This case shows us how thinly spread the police cover is,\" Oliver Malchow, chairman of the GdP, told German broadcaster ZDF.\n\n\"While we're tackling terrorism we cannot at the same time involve many staff in monitoring far-right extremists,\" he added. \"We didn't underestimate it, but we can't foresee everything and prevent it.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Angela Merkel joined the Jewish community for a vigil in solidarity in Berlin\n\nAuthorities have noted a recent rise of anti-Semitic incidents in Germany, a country that is still haunted by the murder of six million Jews under Nazi rule.\n\nThey provide varying degrees of protection to synagogues. But when this is not possible, local Jewish communities sometimes work with law enforcement to provide for their own security.\n\nSince the shooting, police presence has been increased outside synagogues in several east German cities, including Leipzig and Dresden, according to local media.\n\nThe attack has been condemned by European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nAt an event in Nuremberg, Ms Merkel said the government would use \"all means available\" to tackle hatred and bigotry.\n\nElsewhere, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the shooting as a \"terror attack\" and warned anti-Semitism was on the rise in Europe.", "description": "Police were not guarding the synagogue attacked in Halle - yet it was Yom Kippur, a major festival.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16D93/production/_109178539_mediaitem109178537.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
