It's left up to the consumer, it's all their fault if something goes wrong.\"\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission said its focus would now shift to forcing companies to police their products before they were let loose on consumers, requiring them to dump those that are too complex and prune fine print \"sludge\".\n\nMs Thorp's research was among the case studies, collected over a decade, contained in the ASIC report, published on Monday night.\n\nHer research found superannuation dashboards \u2013 intended to provide a simple snapshot summary of a super product on a fund's website \u2013 were found to be \"vulnerable to manipulation\".\n\n\"The experiment found people don't always do what we expect, nor act in their best interest.\"\n\nThat's down to how the information is presented, she said. The experiment found that the information was presented in a way where people were choosing to \"avoid all their eggs being in one basket\" when assessing whether to select investments in stocks, property or other assets.\n\nBut when investing in super, consumers needed to think more about risk and return, Ms Thorp said. When the one-page form was changed to encourage that kind of choice framework, consumers then changed their behaviour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Disclosure needs to be tested not so much as if they understand but how they apply the disclosed information in their decision-making,\" Ms Thorp said.\n\nThe report also found that advisers disclosing a conflict of interest \u2013 traditionally relied on as a key safeguard to warn consumers \u2013 sometimes had the opposite effect.\n\nThe report revealed research that found some customers \"may place an even higher degree of trust in the salesperson, as a result of the salesperson's candidness\".\n\nThen there's the \"likeability\" of the adviser.\n\n\"We know that people will often judge the quality of advice on the likeability of advisers,\" Ms Guthrie said.\n\nThe peak representative body for the $1.4 trillion profit-to-member funds which includes industry funds and public-sector funds and corporate (company staff) funds, said the ASIC report reinforced the need for default super funds.\n\n\"This report reinforces what we have known for a long time: that the default safety net in super is vital to protecting consumers. Disclosure is necessary but insufficient when it comes to protecting consumers and improving their retirement outcomes,\" Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees chief Eva Scheerlinck said.", "description": "Finally.
