Both the monthly and daily contracts debuted on Sept. 23.\n\nEach of Bakkt\u2019s futures contracts represents one bitcoin, so the total trading volume works out to just over $5 million, based on the current price of $8,322.\n\nBy comparison, some 4,099 bitcoin futures contracts traded on Friday alone at rival Chicago-based exchange operator CME, whose market opened in 2017. And the CME\u2019s futures contracts represent five bitcoins, for a trading volume of $165 million on the single day.\n\nBakkt\u2019s daily futures contracts fared even more poorly, with fewer than six contracts trading throughout the first week.\n\nExecutives at Bakkt had touted the new contract as a milestone for the cryptocurrency industry, catering to big institutional investors that have thus far been slow to buy bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\nAccording to the exchange, the new offering should appeal to institutional investors like hedge funds and other money managers because bitcoin must be delivered to fulfill the contract\u2019s terms when the maturity date arrives. That feature has been touted as a key advantage for asset owners who want to hedge their portfolios, in contrast with the CME\u2019s contract, which is settled via cash payments but has become popular with individual investors.\n\nDave Weisberger, CEO of CoinRoutes, a New York-based company that helps investors route cryptocurrency trades to various exchanges, says that bitcoin investors currently in the market already have plenty of places to buy and sell, but it\u2019s too early to write off Bakkt\u2019s new push, he said in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cIt takes time for people to move from one place to another, unless there\u2019s a cost reason or a liquidity reason,\u201d Weisberger, a veteran of Wall Street firms Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, said in a telephone interview, adding:\n\n\u201cThese things tend to develop slowly.\u201d\n\nDamon Leavell, a spokesman for Intercontinental Exchange, said in an email that there was \u201cstrong industry participation\u201d during the first week of the new bitcoin contract.\n\nThe contract maturing in October, he said, had the \u201ctightest bid-offer spreads in the market, which was an exciting achievement.\u201d\n\nWall Street analysts look at the so-called bid-ask spread \u2013 the gap between what buyers are offering to pay and what sellers are offering to accept \u2013 as a gauge of how efficiently a market is operating.\n\nChart image via Shutterstock", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/etcrbcb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
