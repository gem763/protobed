Blitzchung shouted \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age\" in Chinese while wearing a gas mask during a post-match interview at a Blizzard-sponsored \"Hearthstone\" tournament in Taiwan on October 5.\n\nIn the blog post announcing Blitzchung's ban, Blizzard said he had violated the rules of the competition by making statements that were harmful to the company.\n\nRead more: Blizzard is under scrutiny from lawmakers, gamers, and maybe even its own employees after punishing a 'Hearthstone' competitor who voiced his support for protesters in Hong Kong\n\nHours after Blizzard announced Blitzchung's ban, a former Blizzard employee tweeted that some backlash seemed to be brewing internally: Someone had covered up two of the company's key values \u2014 \"Think Globally\" and \"Every Voice Matters\" \u2014 enshrined on a statue at the company's headquarters.\n\nA day later, a group of about 30 Blizzard employees gathered near the center of the the company's campus to protest the ban and show support for protesters in Hong Kong.\n\n\"The action Blizzard took against the player was pretty appalling but not surprising,\" one Blizzard employee told The Daily Beast. \"Blizzard makes a lot of money in China, but now the company is in this awkward position where we can't abide by our values.\"\n\nThe significance of the umbrella\n\nThe original Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong began in 2014, when protesters took to the streets calling for universal suffrage. The protesters in Hong Kong began carrying umbrellas to guard against the use of pepper spray by riot police.\n\nOver the last four months, millions of people in Hong Kong have marched to demand sovereignty from mainland China and protest increasingly poor socioeconomic conditions. The ongoing protests have already garnered international attention, with the territory's increasingly complex relationship with China's communist government as a core issue.\n\nEven as Blizzard employees gathered in protest, \"Hearthstone\" commentator Brian Kibler announced that he would decline working with the company for the finals of its Grandmasters competition. Though Kibler agreed that Blitzchung had violated the company's policies, he said the punishment seemed too harsh for the situation.\n\n\"The heavy-handedness of it feels like someone insisted that Blizzard make an example of Blitzchung, not only to discourage others from similar acts in the future but also to appease those upset by the outburst itself,\" Kibler wrote. \"That kind of appeasement is simply not something I can in good conscience be associated with.\"\n\nBlizzard's response has also garnered attention from US. lawmakers, including Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. Both senators implied that Blizzard's decision was an act of censorship.\n\n\"Blizzard shows it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party,\" Wyden tweeted. \"No American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck.\"", "description": "Blizzard employees apparently gathered at the center of the company's headquarters with umbrellas to show solidarity for protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9e4f1c3b33a728f47c72c8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
