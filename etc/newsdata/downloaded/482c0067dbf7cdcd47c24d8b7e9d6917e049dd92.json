And last week, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange withdrew its takeover pursuit of the LSE after political pressure.\n\nThe latest plans have emerged at a critical time for the City, the hub of the UK's financial services sector. According to a parliamentary report, 1.1million people work in the UK's financial services industry, which contributed \u00a3132billion to the UK economy, equal to 6.9 per cent of total economic output.\n\nBut there are fears for the sector post-Brexit. Accountancy giant EY last month suggested that 1,000 financial services jobs have already been switched from London to rival European cities and another 7,000 could be moved in the 'near future'.\n\nBusiness relations between the UK and China have also been under strain since security concerns were raised over Chinese technology giant Huawei's involvement in Britain's broadband network\n\nOther reports \u2013 some of which have been dismissed by Brexit supporters as part of 'Project Fear' \u2013 have claimed that more than 100,000 jobs could be lost in the long run. Friction between China's President Xi Jinping and Trump has also intensified over the past year.\n\nIn its report, the City of London says Trump's threat to delist Chinese firms from US stock exchanges could present an opportunity to attract firms seeking to sell their shares.\n\n'Chinese companies have become more cautious about using the US markets to raise capital because of the trade war,' the report said. 'This presents an additional opportunity for London to be considered a prime international location for Chinese IPOs [initial public offerings].'\n\nThe report \u2013 drawn up by City of London Corporation policymakers and due to be approved as a new strategy by the body's leaders at a meeting this Thursday \u2013 notes the issues facing China such as the US trade war, 'political turmoil' in Hong Kong and slowing export trade. But it added: 'The Chinese government is cutting taxes, easing restrictions on cross-border money flows and accelerating the opening-up of its financial and capital markets.'\n\nThe City of London says Trump's threat to delist Chinese firms from US stock exchanges could present an opportunity to attract firms seeking to sell their shares, says report\n\nThe report's authors believe this will create 'a tremendous opportunity for the City and global asset managers'. They added: 'Focus for the next 12 months is to encourage Chinese institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies to expand their use of London as a platform for global asset allocation.'\n\nA division of the corporation, Innovation and Growth, is developing a campaign with the aim of promoting the use of London as a prime platform to help Chinese investors with their global asset allocation. The scheme launches this month.\n\nAround 35 major Chinese financial institutions already have subsidiaries or large offices in London, employing 3,500 people. The report says China is a 'top tier priority market' to target for new business at a 'crucial time' as Brexit approaches.\n\nThe LSE is a key cog in Britain's relationship with Beijing. The Corporation says 113 'dim sum bonds' \u2013 investment assets denominated in China's renminbi currency \u2013 are now listed on the LSE.\n\nAnd in June, the LSE and Shanghai Stock Exchange announced a new tie-up which makes it easier for UK investors to access the Chinese market and vice versa.", "description": "City bosses have drawn up a plan to woo Chinese giants after Brexit and transform London into the 'prime international location' for Beijing firms to list their shares, we can reveal.", "authors": ["William Turvill For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
