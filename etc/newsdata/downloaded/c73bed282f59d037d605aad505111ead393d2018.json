And make very smart choices particularly late at night. That is my advice to players.'\n\nGreenberg was also confident the NRL wouldn't face the same issues that plagued it during last summer's nightmare off-season.\n\n'I think every single player who puts on an NRL jersey is acutely aware of their responsibility,' he said.\n\n'We can't have a repeat of what we saw last year.\n\n'Players will know if they make poor errors of judgment or poor decisions there is going to be significant consequences for those.'\n\nAsofa-Solomona is believed to have been interviewed by the NRL's integrity unit on Tuesday after facing Storm officials on Monday.\n\nMelbourne winger Josh Addo-Carr, who was among a group of Storm players who were holidaying in Bali, said his teammate had been shaken by the incident.\n\n'Obviously he was a bit rattled at first, but I'm sure he's doing sweet now. His family will be around him, us teammates will be around him too,' Addo-Carr said.\n\n'I'm sure he's doing pretty well.'\n\nAddo-Carr wasn't with Asofa-Solomona at the time, but said he learned of it immediately when his teammates returned to the villas where they were staying.\n\nBut he called for him to avoid suspension and be able to play against Australia and Great Britain, adding he too wouldn't want to let anyone get hit.\n\nMeanwhile Vunivalu was a notable absentee during the Nines launch in Sydney but is expected to join his teammates later in the week.\n\nBut despite images of him sporting numerous cuts to the face being published by News Corp, he is still expected to play for Fiji at the Nines this weekend.\n\n'All the boys have messaged him. He knows he's loved. All the boys love him to death, so all we can do now is be there for him,' Fiji hooker Api Koroisau said.", "description": "Melbourne Storm winger Suliasi Vunivalu has backed up Nelson Asofa-Solomona for protecting him after he was violently attacked in a nightclub in Bali.", "authors": ["Jackson Barron For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/11/19831372-0-image-a-23_1571309006837.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
