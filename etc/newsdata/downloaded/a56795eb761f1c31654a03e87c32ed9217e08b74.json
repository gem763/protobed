Isn't that bad enough? Can't they be given a bit of dignity?' she said.\n\nMs Rizniak said she can hear the frantic moving and steel being hit together throughout the night, loud enough to wake her up.\n\nBefore moving into the home, she inquired into the surroundings and was under the impression the abattoir did not operate at night.\n\nAfter two years of living near the noise it became too much and she decided to formally complain to Moreton Bay Council.\n\nBut the council failed to do anything about it.\n\n'I did ask [Meramist] why, 'why are you only bringing horses in during the night?' Because they do not bring them in during the day,' Ms Rizniak said.\n\nAn explosive two year investigation by ABC's 7.30 shows racehorse being brutally mistreated\n\nAfter further questioning, Ms Rizniak was told it was none of her business.\n\nSince then, she has watched the harrowing footage on the ABC and wishes she had done more.\n\nThe ABC also discovered that horses were being trapped inside kill boxes unable to move while workers applied electric shocks to the their bodies.\n\nMeramist Abattoir is alleged to have slaughtered hundreds of racehorses and is now being investigated after the footage was made public, the Queensland government confirmed.\n\nQueensland Racing Minister Stirling Hinchliffe told the Daily Telegraph the Minister for Agriculture has directed biosecurity officers to go in and investigate animal cruelty allegations at the Meramist Abattoir.\n\n'They'll be working I understand with Queensland Police Service to retrieve any extra footage that was not screened by the ABC.\n\n'Those inspectors going into the abattoir today, they'll seize all the information they can, they'll take action against people who committed cruelty against animals.'\n\nTruckloads of horses arrive during the night to the abattoir, and Ms Rizniak said they are clearly distressed (Pictured: horses at Meramist Abattoir)\n\nShocking vision shows workers at the abattoir mistreating the horses, whipping them, kicking them and even yelling at them\n\nRacing Australia's official data claims about 34 racehorses every year end up at slaughterhouses, a figure amounting to less than one per cent of retiring horses.\n\nBut Elio Celotto from the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses told the ABC that about 4,000 racehorses had been killed in one abattoir alone.\n\nMeramist Abattoir was the focus of the broadcaster's investigation and was infiltrated with hidden cameras.\n\nThe cameras showed that in just 22 days, more than 300 racehorses, who won $5million in prize money combined, were killed.\n\nMr Celotto said even from the property boundary, hundreds of horses can be seen unloaded and abused by workers.\n\nShocking vision shows workers at the abattoir mistreating the horses, whipping them, kicking them and even yelling abuse at them.\n\nNaomi Rizniak, who moved into a quiet cul de sac in Caboolture about four years ago with her husband, believing it would be the perfect place to raise their three children\n\n'Come on you dumb f***ing horse! F***! You're dead! You are dead!' a worker can be heard screaming.\n\nOther workers were shown yelling in glee as they bolted the horses in the head with a stun gun - some up to five times before they died.\n\nAnimal welfare and behaviour scientist Professor Paul McGreevy told the ABC there was 'no way' the racing industry could defend the behaviour.\n\n'This is a clear breach of everything the industry has told us. Clearly there's no excuse for that sort of treatment, that's not acceptable... and it's disgusting,' he said.\n\n'The truth that's been revealed by these videos is that thoroughbreds are entering knackeries and abattoirs, and that their treatment within those facilities can be appalling.\n\n'I think we're at a fork in the road moment. There's no denying the footage. This is the sort of material that will shake the industry to its core.'", "description": "Meramist Abattoir in Caboolture, in Queensland's south-east, is now under investigation for alleged animal mistreatment after the explosive footage emerged.", "authors": ["Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/05/19946552-0-image-a-33_1571544602557.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
