The UK non-papers do not meet the objectives of the backstop.\u201d\n\nA UK government official said Johnson had made it clear Northern Ireland staying in some sort of backstop on its own was \u201cnot a solution that the UK government could accept\u201d.\n\nTusk tweeted following the meeting: \u201cNo breakdown. No breakthrough. No time to lose.\u201d\n\nIn another setback, while Johnson used a TV interview to call on the Republic of Ireland to potentially compromise over the border issue, the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, whom Johnson was due to meet on Tuesday, poured cold water on the idea.\n\nAfter talks at the UN general assembly with Tusk, Varadkar said Ireland would not accept a \u201chalfway house\u201d plan for the border.\n\n\u201cThere are also some people that believe at the last minute that Ireland will somehow fold or give up our position and that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the pair\u2019s 45-minute meeting, Varadkar\u2019s spokesman said he and Tusk agreed that the EU had still not seen any viable UK solutions to the Irish border and that \u201ctime is very short\u201d if there was to be a deal by next month\u2019s European council summit.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, described Johnson\u2019s solution for replacing the backstop as unacceptable, giving his most downbeat assessment yet of the chances of striking a Brexit deal by 31 October.\n\nStanding alongside the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, following a meeting in Berlin, Barnier said the UK wanted a \u201cregulatory and customs land border on the island of Ireland\u201d and thus for the EU to change how the single market operated.\n\n\u201cAs I am sure you will understand, this is unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mandate is clear of the 27 leaders, the EU and the European parliament, safeguarding peace and stability in Ireland and protecting the integrity of the single market.\u201d\n\nIn what Downing Street has billed as Johnson\u2019s setpiece Brexit speech in New York, on Tuesday morning he is to address US and Canadian businesspeople in the city\u2019s plush and newly built Hudson Yards district.\n\nAccording to extracts of the speech released in advance, Johnson will promise that a post-Brexit UK would \u201croll out the red carpet\u201d for US businesses, with \u201cthe most competitive tax rates and the best skilled workforce in the hemisphere\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs we come out of the EU we are going up a gear,\u201d he is due to say. \u201cWe are going to take advantage of all the freedoms that Brexit can give, whether that is new tax allowances for investment or speeding up public procurement contracts.\u201d\n\nIn a round of TV interviews in New York, Johnson said examples where the UK could diverge from EU regulations in the future could be financial services or biotechnology, \u201cwhere we want to do things different\u201d.\n\nHe told Channel 4 News: \u201cTo give you another example, it may be that we want, for instance, to take advantage of tax freedoms to allow companies to invest more in capital and plant. We may want to do free ports in the UK to drive up economic growth in areas that have fallen behind.\u201d\n\nThe EU has insisted it will not sign up to a deal that creates a regulatory and customs border on the island of Ireland, as proposed by the UK in the papers tabled last week by the government\u2019s chief negotiator, David Frost.\n\nAsked by Channel 4 if Ireland could help the impasse by, for example, accepting some UK regulations, Johnson called for movement on all sides.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is certainly a good thing is if everybody comes together to try to sort this out,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s an opportunity for us to get an agreement that really looks after the critical interests of everybody including Ireland.\u201d\n\nTalking to Sky News, Johnson argued that the UK proposal for a common Irish regulatory area for sanitary and phytosanitary products \u2013 mainly agriculture and food \u2013 was a major shift by London.\n\n\u201cI think possibly what\u2019s becoming clear to people is that the UK has actually made a big offer when it comes to the unity of the sanitary and phytosanitary zone for the whole of Ireland. That\u2019s a big concession by us, it\u2019s an imaginative move,\u201d he said.", "description": "Financial services and biotech among sectors the PM wants to move away from EU standards", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9d195343338e9f2e55fe68a62d9e0145d698103/0_61_3367_2020/master/3367.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22ab078bd6698c4be7b561b273277a6e", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
