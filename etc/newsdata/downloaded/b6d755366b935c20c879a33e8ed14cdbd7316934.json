People would say 'congratulations' and ask me when my baby is due.\n\n'Even random people in the street look at my stomach and say congratulations. Sometimes I correct them, but it drags me down - it's confidence knocking.\n\n'I bloat when I'm tired, after sex, when I'm ovulating, on my period. It affects everything I do, it affects my partner. The only clothes I fit into are pyjamas.'\n\nMs Veitch was diagnosed with the condition in November 2018, despite suffering with debilitating symptoms since the age of nine.\n\nEndometriosis is a condition and affects one in 10 women in the UK with varying levels of severity.\n\nOther symptoms include migraines, chronic fatigue, heavy periods and severe constipation.\n\nMs Veitch said the misplaced pregnancy comments have hit her especially hard as she has suffered three miscarriages because the condition also affects fertility.\n\nShe said her daughter suffers with separation anxiety because she spends so much time either in bed.

It really takes its toll. I have difficulty conceiving. With endometriosis you're at higher risk of miscarriage.\n\n'People should think before they ask when it's due because they don't know my personal struggles.'\n\nWHAT IS ENDOMETRIOSIS AND HOW IS IT DIAGNOSED? Endometriosis occurs when cells in the lining of the womb are found elsewhere in the body such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Each month, these cells react in the same way as those in the womb; building up, breaking down and bleeding. Yet, the blood has no way to escape the body. Symptoms include pain, heavy periods and fatigue, as well as a higher risk of infertility, and bowel and bladder problems. Around 1.5million women in the UK are suffering from the disease. Its cause is unknown but may be genetic, related to problems with the immune system or exposure to chemicals. The only definitive way to diagnose endometriosis is by a laparoscopy - an operation in which a camera - a laparoscope - is inserted into the pelvis via a small cut near the navel. The surgeon uses the camera to see the pelvic organs and look for any signs of endometriosis. If endometriosis is diagnosed, the endometriosis may be treated or removed for further examination during the laparoscopy. Treatment focuses on pain relief and improving quality of life, which may include surgery or hormone treatment.

Ms Veitch credits her partner for keeping the family functioning.\n\nThe mother added: 'If I'm in pain, I also can't run around after Ava and I can't always pick her up from school.\n\n'I'm lucky I've got Chris, but it puts pressure on him and our relationship. He's working, cooking, doing housework and I'm saying 'get me a hot water bottle, get me this and that'.'\n\nDespite her struggles, she plans to go back to work next month and hopes to have another child in the future.\n\nShe now works with charity, Women with Endometriosis, who support women living with the little-understood condition.\n\nMs Veitch said: 'People don't understand the pain that it causes. It's invisible. If you lose a leg people can see, with invisible illnesses it's a touchy subject to talk about.\n\n'I felt like I wasn't believed before and I felt so relieved when I was finally diagnosed.'", "description": "Amelia Veitch, from Essex, suffers from endometriosis, which occurs when cells in the lining of the womb grow outside the uterus.
