It's not. Just like winter is coming, the Islamic state is coming back.'\n\nHe added: 'Unfortunately, I would predict just as we accelerated an operation that was in the pipeline to take Baghdadi, they will accelerate operations they have in the pipeline, particularly targeting Europe, I would guess.'\n\nFormer US Nato commander James Stavridis warned Monday that the terror network will likely accelerate planned attacks after the death of its leader and may look to target Christmas markets in their assault.

Good to have you perspective.'\n\nThe president is facing renewed criticism for his decision to withdraw U.S. Troops from Syria and leave the Kurds to confront a Turkish offensive alone after it was revealed Kurdish intelligence gathered the most information to help locate al-Baghdadi.\n\nTwo intelligence officials revealed to the New York Times it was actually Syrian and Iraqi Kurds who provided the most information about al-Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts and were instrumental in bringing him down.\n\nA satellite view of al-Baghdadi's compound near the village of Barisha in Syria pictured above", "description": "Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a raid Saturday in\u00a0Syria.
