Most investors are better off being invested in contingent capital in a strong, stable bank, than in senior debt in weaker banks. At 7.5%, there are just better things to buy,\" Harris said.\n\n\"They raised the 350 million (pounds) in equity, which was great, and I still think the bank is in good shape from a balance sheet perspective \u2013 they are just being undone by the rules.\"\n\nAnalysts at Barclays (LON: ) said the failure made it more likely Metro would have to sell further chunks of its loan book, after offloading a portfolio of mortgages to private equity firm Cerberus earlier this year.\n\n\"Regardless of whether Metro can eventually issue, we think there's an increasing likelihood \u2013 and need - for Metro to dispose of 'non-core' assets,\" Barclays analysts said in a note.\n\nSince Metro Bank's admission of its loan book error, the lender's shares are down more than 90%, making it the worst performing British bank stock in the this year.\n\nThe mistake \u2013 which is subject to ongoing probes by regulators \u2013 led some business customers to pull money out of the bank and forced Metro Bank's founder Vernon Hill to announce plans to step down as chairman.\n\nMetro Bank has been one of Britain's most shorted stocks this year, with hedge funds including Odey Asset Management betting the challenger bank's problems will get worse.\n\nAlmost 93% of Metro shares available to short had been utilised as of Monday, according to Astec Analytics data.", "description": "Metro Bank shares plunge to new record low after debt issue axed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8N0FE_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
