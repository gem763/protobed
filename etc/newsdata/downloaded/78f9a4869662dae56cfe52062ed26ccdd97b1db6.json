That\u2019s exactly what happened on Saturday night in New York, though it might not be what the former unified middleweight champion had in mind.\n\nGennady Golovkin defeats Sergiy Derevyanchenko for IBF middleweight title \u2013 live! Read more\n\nGolovkin was pushed like we\u2019ve rarely seen before, looking every bit his 37 years in surviving a heart-stopping challenge from the game Sergiy Derevyanchenko to regain the IBF middleweight champion by a unanimous decision, a verdict that left many in the Madison Square Garden crowd dissatisfied. Ringside judges Eric Marlinski and Kevin Morgan scored it 115-112, while Frank Lombardi had it 114-113. (The Guardian scored it 115-112 to Golovkin.)\n\n\u201cThis is huge experience for me,\u201d Golovkin said. \u201cRight now, I understand I need more focus [on] boxing. This was a tough fight. I need a little bit more. I need to still get stronger in my camp. Just more serious. I need to work hard. I need a little bit more focus.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cRight now it\u2019s bad day for me, it\u2019s a huge day for Sergiy, his team. This is huge experience for me. Right now I know what I need exactly. I lost a little bit of focus. Sergiy was ready. I really respect him. He showed me such a big heart. I told him, \u2018Sergiy, this is best fight for me.\u2019 I just respect his team.\u201d\n\nThe crowd-pleasing Kazakh dropped Derevyanchenko with a left hand in the first round, then appeared on his way to yet another stoppage win after his opponent suffered a bad cut on his right eye in the second.\n\nBut Derevyanchenko, perhaps sensing time was short given the wound, burst from his corner in the third and immediately changed the tenor with aggressive volume punching, rushing pell-mell into the pocket and letting his hands go from a variety of angles.\n\nGolovkin was able to catch Derevyanchenko time and again on the way in, but the 33-year-old from Ukraine was getting the better of the exchanges in the fourth. Both had their moments in the fifth but it was Derevyanchenko who took control late, rearranging Golovkin\u2019s insides with a punishing body shot that sent the Kazakh backwards. (That referee Harvey Dock intervened for no discernable reason left the Derevyanchenko camp furious.)\n\nThe Ukrainian poured on the punishment with more body work in the six and by now was outboxing Golovkin, who was appearing to tire. Every time Golovkin was able to land a power shot, Derevyanchenko was there to respond with flurries of punches to the head and body. The two-way action contined into the seventh as both made their stands in the center of the ring, Golovkin doing his best work catching Derevyanchenko on the way in.\n\nGolovkin came on strong in the eighth, bouncing a series of punches off Derevyanchenko\u2019s head as the crowd leaned in for the finish. But he mysteriously let his foot off the gas and his opponenent off the hook, who resumed scoring with angles and activity.\n\nThe two-way action continued into the championship rounds as a bloodied Derevyanchenko threw with abandon to the head and body as Golovkin held his ground, an extraordinary and gruesome display. But Golovkin overcame his obvious fatigue to show the finishing kick of a champion in the 12th, snapping his opponent\u2019s head back with clean and accurate punches and winning the final frame on all three judges\u2019 cards to seal the decision.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s bad day for me, it\u2019s a huge day for Sergiy, his team,\u201d said Golovkin, who landed 242 of 720 punches (34%) compared to 230 of 738 for Derevyanchenko (31%). \u201cRight now I know what I need exactly. I lost a little bit of focus. Sergiy was ready. I really respect him. He showed me such a big heart. I told him, \u2018Sergiy, this is best fight for me.\u2019 I just respect his team.\u201d\n\nBoth were taken to the hospital immediately afterward for precautionary measures.\n\nMore to follow.", "description": "Gennady Golovkin regained the IBF middleweight title with a unanimous-decision win over Sergiy Derevyanchenko at Madison Square Garden", "authors": ["Bryan Armen Graham"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78fe19a8f3fd110c13d692b46675f06f270374b9/0_0_1617_970/master/1617.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=30c7f0a243502d891da5a8ec0a5c683f", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
