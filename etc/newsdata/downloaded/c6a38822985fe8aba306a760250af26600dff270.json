This whole situation is just a lot, isn't it?\n\nAfter Miley and Liam announced their divorce at the end of August, Miley quickly went public with her relationship with Kaitlynn Carter. But that wasn't to be, with the pair splitting up almost as quickly as things started.\n\nPhoto credit: Instagram/Angie Simpson More\n\nMiley then appeared to take things social media official with Cody Simpson, referring to him on Instagram as her boyfriend, and sharing a number of Stories of them looking cosy. Liam, meanwhile, was spotted holding hands with Australian actress Maddison Brown, confirming he had also moved on.\n\nSo all's well that ends well, right? Er, wrong actually, because Cody is still out here throwing shade in Liam's direction, hinting that he wasn't a very romantic husband.\n\nDuring an appearance on the Kyle & Jackie O Show, Cody touched on how his relationship with Miley was going, while also dragging her previous partners. 'I\u2019m very, very, very romantic,' he said. 'I don\u2019t think she [Miley]...she\u2019d talked about how she hadn\u2019t had that kind of an experience in a relationship before.'\n\nSpeaking of how the romance developed, Cody continued, 'We\u2019ve just been close ever since we met. It\u2019s like the first time I\u2019ve been with someone that it wasn\u2019t necessarily an immediate romance. It was a friendship and it was fun and it just developed over like five years.'\n\nHe continued, 'She\u2019s been through a lot this year and I was trying to be respectful of that and we kind of found each other. We just found each other in a place where we\u2019re both ready for something like this and we\u2019re both sober\u2026 We keep each other in a good space. I\u2019ve never had that in a relationship.'\n\nSounds like the real deal.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "This is getting a bit catty", "authors": ["Dusty Baxter-Wright"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8malc_rG2H2TAkaMz9qEgA--~B/aD01MDI7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/ffcfb1842fd8ced57f43548992fda1eb", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
