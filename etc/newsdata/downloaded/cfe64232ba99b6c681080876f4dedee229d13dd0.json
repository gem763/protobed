The fact that they happened in Brazil, is also no surprise as the country's local cybercriminal gangs have a reputation of being able to clone EMV cards, according to a Kaspersky report from 2018, when such attacks have started to increase in frequency and sophistication.\n\nManuel Pintag, a cybersecurity analyst and banking fraud expert for Telefonica, told ZDNet that Brazil and Mexico are \"the largest EMV card cloning laboratories.\"\n\nLocal criminals often advertise tools to aid in the creation of fully functional clones for EMV cards.\n\nTo clone a modern chip-and-PIN card, Pintag told ZDNet that all criminals need is a copy of a legitimate EMV card's magnetic strip.\n\nTo obtain such information, criminals often rely on card sniffing devices installed on ATMs or POS terminals, which are also suspected as the primary sources for the debit cards used in the recent OLB incident.\n\nAs Kaspersky pointed out in its 2018 report, a valid PIN isn't always even needed, with some cloned cards working with any random PIN entered in a POS or ATM terminal.\n\nIn a statement sent to ZDNet, Mastercard said it is still investigating the incident, but the payments processor was able to shoot down some rumors.\n\n\"We can confirm that neither Mastercard's network or the EMV technology were compromised,\" a Mastercard spokesperson said. \"Nor has any account or card data been hacked either at Mastercard, OLB or at a third party. This issue derived from a scam involving organized cybercrime using counterfeit cards and terminals.\"\n\nFor the past few years, detecting withdrawals from cloned EMV cards has been a problem for banks around the world.\n\nAs Pintag told ZDNet, the easiest way is to monitor for the location and time of financial transactions. Often, fraudulent transactions are mixed with legitimate ones, in two countries at the same time, which Pintag said is a good indicator that card fraud is happening.\n\nArticle updated 15 minutes after publication with statement from Mastercard.", "description": "Brazilian criminal gang cloned Mastercard debit cards issued by German bank OLB and withdrew more than \u20ac1.5 million from about 2,000 of its customers.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/04/20/1c1e1b78-e8ff-4bef-8885-6416e1cc6dfb/thumbnail/770x578/19c2f7ef7a00089c0d3ad21e79950f43/mastercard.jpg"}
