The transaction was commercial.\"\n\nGeneral purpose liquidators made a number of claims against Mr Palmer in their closing submissions.\n\nJustice Mullins warned she was \"likely to take a red pen\" to a number of claims against Mr Palmer which stepped outside the central focus of the case.\n\nShe also said Mr Palmer, who was not in court in Brisbane on Wednesday, would have to be given the opportunity to respond to the claims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Ward said a number of the claims against Mr Palmer were \"gratuitous\" and should be rejected.\n\nHe said the case against Mr Palmer and his companies had \"changed dramatically\" over the course of the trial, especially since the $100 million settlement with special purpose liquidators in August.\n\nUnder the terms of the settlement, the special purpose liquidators \u2013 who were seeking repayment of the $66 million in workers' entitlements which had been paid by the Commonwealth \u2013 claims of shadow directorship against Mr Palmer and trading while insolvent were withdrawn.\n\nBut general purpose liquidators have continued to make the claims against Mr Palmer.\n\nMr Palmer has claimed outside court that the only reason the general purpose liquidators were continuing the case was to ensure they got paid their multimillion-dollar fees.\n\nShane Doyle, QC, for the liquidators, said their expert witnesses showed Queensland Nickel was insolvent in October 2015, three months earlier than claimed by Mr Palmer's lawyers.\n\n\"It was foolhardy to say, on January 13, the company had the capacity to pay its debts,\" Mr Doyle said.\n\n\"If they say they had the money in the bank, why didn't they pay their debts? If QNI had the capacity to pay they would have.\"\n\nMr Doyle said Mr Palmer's expert witness Suellen McCallum had underestimated the precarious financial position of QNI.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Clive Palmer's Queensland Nickel refinery has been accused of making questionable loans just days before it went into administration.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6157%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_215%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/97572a345e1f52ea190673fbca3ef3844195f563", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
