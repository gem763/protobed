(Bird founder Travis VanderZanden announced the company\u2019s Series D round of $275 million at a $2.5 billion valuation during our recent TechCrunch Disrupt event.)\n\nFluhr focuses on marketplaces and e-commerce startups and the firm cites as one of his more prominent deals as the Series A round of the nursing marketplace Trusted Health. Lee is focused on breakthrough technologies and counts among his investments the esports company Cloud9, a company that went on to raise $50 million in Series B funding last year (and is probably due to announce yet another round soon).\n\nMeanwhile, Dayton \u2014 who is very notably a co-founder with Travis Kalanick in CloudKitchens, the dark kitchen company that\u2019s literally trying to take over the world\u2014 focuses on so-called hard tech, drawing on his experience with launching the dial-up pioneer EarthLink, along with the Wi-Fi service provider Boingo Wireless.\n\nAll four have impressive portfolios as angel investors, including bets on Affirm, Airbnb, Facebook, Houzz and Slack, though naturally, they\u2019ve also backed startups that haven\u2019t proved winners. An investment in the HR payroll startup, Zenefits proved particularly trying for Sacks, who acquired a sizable stake in the company and \u2014 when its founding CEO, Parker Conrad, was ousted amid a regulatory scandal \u2014 stepped in to try to fix its errant ways. (He left after less than a year at the helm.)\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to know if they\u2019ll have as much success as a team, but some of Craft\u2019s more recent bets include Terminal, a San Francisco-based startup that helps companies to source and manage remote engineers in international locations; it raised $17 million in funding just last month.\n\nAnother is Superplastic, a year-old, Burlington, Vt.-based maker of limited-edition art toys that\u2019s trying to turn two of its characters into animated digital media stars. It raised $10 million in Series A funding led by Craft in the summer.\n\nAt the firm\u2019s outset, blockchain was a major theme, though Craft appears to be fast-evolving into an outfit that invests far more broadly.\n\nIt may have been too early. At least, Harbor, a decentralized compliance protocol that aims to standardize the way crypto securities are issued, was a deal that Craft announced around the same time that it was itself launching publicly. But Harbor\u2019s founders have since left the company to start Internal, a startup that wants to help companies better manage their internal consoles so they can ensure that not everyone on staff has access to sensitive data.\n\nInternal closed on $5 million in seed funding led by Craft last month, a deal we wrote about here.", "description": "Craft Ventures, the venture firm launched in 2017 by serial entrepreneur David Sacks, has closed its second fund with $500 million in capital commitments, an amount the firm was said to begin targeting roughly a year ago.
