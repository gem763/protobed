We would have collided,\u201d the Briton said of an incident where he was squeezed off track and forced to cut a corner by the 21-year-old Monegasque in an aggressive defensive move.\n\nHamilton ended the day 63 points clear of his closest rival and Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas, who finished second, with seven of 21 races remaining.\n\nLeclerc won Ferrari\u2019s home race from pole position, with Hamilton putting him under plenty of pressure until his Mercedes\u2019s tyres had no life left in them.\n\nHamilton ended up third, but with a precious extra point for fastest lap.\n\nLeclerc, who has won the last two races, is fourth overall but 102 points behind the Briton and only mathematically in title contention against a rival who has finished all but two races this season on the podium.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely zero issue with us, I think he did an exceptional job today,\u201d Hamilton told reporters after the race when asked about the incident.\n\n\u201cIf we get a moment together we might chat for a second and just reverse roles and make sure he\u2019s cool with it if I\u2019m in that position and that happens.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s cool, then that\u2019s how we are racing.\u201d\n\nHamilton said he respected Leclerc but he was still discovering more about how the youngster, in only his second season and first with Ferrari, behaved on track.\n\n\u201cCharles is one of the most respectful drivers,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is today the first time I\u2019ve really come wheel to wheel with him as such and when you arrive at a new driver you learn how they approach different scenarios.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll position the car differently next time, maybe I\u2019ll do a better job.\u201d\n\nBottas, who pitted later and had fresher tyres than Hamilton at the end, moved into second place after Hamilton went straight at the chicane.\n\nThe Briton said he would have let the Finn go past otherwise.\n\n\u201cI knew that he was much, much quicker and had a shot to potentially win the race,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the most important point for the team.\n\n\u201cSo in hindsight I didn\u2019t have to do that (let him overtake),\u201d he smiled.", "description": "Formula One leader Lewis Hamilton said he would have been far tougher with Ferrari's Italian Grand Prix winner Charles Leclerc on Sunday had the Mercedes driver not been fighting for his sixth world championship.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427944638&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8814S-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
