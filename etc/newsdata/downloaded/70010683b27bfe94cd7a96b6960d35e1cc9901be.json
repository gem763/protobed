According to the statements made by researchers in the paper, Sycamore is capable of conducting a task in 200 seconds which would take 10,000 years on a traditional system.\n\nDon't Miss 122 SHARES 1.1 K SHARES 4.2 K SHARES 308 SHARES\n\nVery proud that our @GoogleAI team has achieved a big breakthrough in quantum computing known as quantum supremacy after over a decade of work, as published in @Nature. Thank you to our collaborators in the research community who helped make this possible.https://t.co/yZUUbZsyA0 \u2014 Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) October 23, 2019\n\nResearchers state in the paper, \"This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.\"\n\nWhile the task that Google researchers conducted isn't of any use as of now, (its primary function was to generate random numbers) however, it makes the first time in history that such a task has successfully demonstrated quantum computing and could soon lead to more practical applications.\n\nThe paper further adds, \"As a result of these developments, quantum computing is transitioning from a research topic to a technology that unlocks new computational capabilities,\" the researchers conclude. \"We are only one creative algorithm away from valuable near-term applications.\"\n\nMIT Technology Review\n\nIn a conversation with MIT Technology Review, Sundar Pichai states, \"if in any field you have a breakthrough, you start somewhere. To borrow an analogy-the Wright brothers. The first plane flew only for 12 seconds, and so there is no practical application of that. But it showed the possibility that a plane could fly.\"\n\nGoogle is now in works to make a system that can implement broader operations that can be applied to a variety of fields. Researchers give the example of designing new materials like lightweight batteries for cars and aircraft, new catalysts that can help a fertiliser be more efficient and effective medicines.\n\nOddly enough, tech giant IBM criticised Googles study before it was published in Nature, in a blog post. It states that Google has overestimated the difficulty of the task and how much time would it take to solve on a computer today. As per IBM, the task could easily complete in 2.5 days with better results.\n\nThe blog post states, \"A headline that includes some variation of \"Quantum Supremacy Achieved\" is almost irresistible to print, but it will inevitably mislead the general public. First because, as we argue above, by its strictest definition the goal has not been met. But more fundamentally, because quantum computers will never reign \"supreme\" over classical computers, but will rather work in concert with them, since each have their unique strengths.\"", "description": "Google researchers state that they have achieved 'quantum supremacy' and have broken through milestones of computing with its quantum computer.
