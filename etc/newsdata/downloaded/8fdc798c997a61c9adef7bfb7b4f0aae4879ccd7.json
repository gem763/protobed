Add Education as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Education news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nHarvard President Lawrence Bacow was slammed as \"tone-deaf\" and \"inappropriate\" by some of those who heard him make the analogy that rich alumni should be free to spread their wealth around instead of always feeling bound to giving to schools at the Ivy League institution they have an affiliation with.\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday to hundreds of members of the Cambridge, Massachusetts, school's alumni relations and fundraising staff, Bacow used the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery in America in 1865, to suggest that Harvard's 12 individual schools no longer own their wealthy graduates, according to the Boston Globe, which first reported on the comments.\n\nBrooks Kraft/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI regret that these comments caused offense. That certainly was not my intent,\u201d Bacow wrote in a message emailed on Saturday morning to the university\u2019s alumni relations and development staff.\n\nBacow referenced the 13th Amendment in response to a question about \"The Harvard Campaign\" -- a concept adopted by his predecessor, Drew Faust, as part of a university-wide fundraising effort to encourage donors to give to schools they have no connection to.\n\nSome schools, such as Harvard Business School, receive an abundance of donations from rich alumni who work on Wall Street or Silicon Valley, while other schools, such the Graduate School of Education, have alumni who go into teaching or work in the nonprofit sector and have less money to donate.\n\nBacow said he now realizes his ill-advised analogy left some attendees feeling \"unsettled.\"\n\nPaul Marotta/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI hoped to convey my belief that our collective job is to help our donors achieve their philanthropic objectives, which might include supporting activities in schools where they enjoyed no prior affiliation,\" Bacow said in his email.\n\nBacow, who was appointed president of Harvard in July 2018, said he plans to turn the controversy into a teachable moment.\n\n\u201cPeople, appropriately, have high expectations for their leaders and their choice of language,\u201d Bacow said in his email. \u201cIn fact, you have high expectations for me as your president. I promise to learn from this experience.\u201d", "description": "Lawrence Bacow was appointed the president of Harvard in July 2018.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/harvard-02-as-gty-190929_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
