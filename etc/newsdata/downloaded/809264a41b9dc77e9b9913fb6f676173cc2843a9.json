Let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades for Wednesday.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Roku (ROKU)\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Roku (ROKU) More\n\nRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU) shares are scorching higher, now more than 30% off its recent lows. With its move over $129.55 on Tuesday, Roku stock was able to reclaim its 50-day moving average.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo what do bulls do now? As I\u2019ve said before, when you find a high-growth stock that you like, begin accumulating it on its eventually massive decline.\n\nShould ROKU stock continue higher, see if it can reclaim the 78.6% retracement near $144. On a pullback, I want to see former uptrend support (blue line) hold as support, as well as the 20-day moving average. If they fail, see how it handles the 61.8% retracement.\n\nIf it holds as support, Roku may continue higher. Below and we could see $110.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Nvidia (NVDA) More\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) made an aggressive move, ripping over $188. It was exactly the move we\u2019ve been waiting for, and NVDA isn\u2019t wasting any time continuing higher. Shares pushed right through $193 to new 2019 highs.\n\nNow what?\n\nOn a move over $200, see if shares can run to the 50% retracement near $208. Above that and the gap between $220 and $225 could be on the table.\n\nShould shares rest or pullback, see that prior resistance between $188 and $193 holds as support. If not, NVDA will need more time to set up again.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) More\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is making an impressive move Tuesday, pushing through $1,240.\n\nThe move launches GOOGL over the 78.6% retracement and puts it into the upper consolidation zone from September. The high from that range was $1,248. Over it and the post-earnings high of $1,268 is on the table. Above that and GOOGL\u2019s all-time high near $1,297 is possible.\n\nOn a decline, see that uptrend support (blue line) buoys the stock price. Falling below that puts the 50-day moving average on the table.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: AT&T (T)\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: AT&T (T) More\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) is finally perking up again, after a big move higher early last month.\n\nT stock did a great job consolidating those gains, as it put in a series of higher lows (blue line). However, it had trouble pushing through resistance at $37.50, forming what\u2019s known as an ascending triangle, a bullish technical pattern.\n\nNow pushing through, see that $37.50 supports T stock, which might now make a move for its prior 52-week high at $38.22. Getting over that level opens the door to $40.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: JPMorgan (JPM)", "description": "After a sleepy session on Monday, stocks got off to a strong start on Tuesday and rallied hard into the afternoon.
