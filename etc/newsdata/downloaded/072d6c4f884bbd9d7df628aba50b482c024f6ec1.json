Bush (Photo: Getty)\n\nEllen DeGeneres' friendship with former President George W. Bush, and the backlash she got for it, may be a silly celebrity story, but if it prompts us to examine what we value, our time will not be wasted.\n\nThis story found a wide audience because it points to a struggle many ordinary people face. DeGeneres can keep whatever friends she wants. What some folks worry about beneath the surface are their own relationships.\n\nTo recap: The comedian and popular talk show host was seen this week with her spouse, Portia de Rossi, enjoying a football game with their friends, George and Laura Bush. You know, friends who just happen to be a former president and first lady of the United States. As one does.\n\nThat\u2019s the first point: These people are not like you, unless you are in a position to be invited by the owner of the Dallas Cowboys to watch a game in a luxury box with an American president.\n\nFriendship despite political differences\n\nTongues wagged and keyboards chattered that her friendship with Bush contradicted her political values. The fact that DeGeneres, a woman married to a woman, would hang around with a president who opposed marriage rights for LGBTQ citizens, seemed inconsistent if not a betrayal.\n\nOthers argued, that as a champion of refugees, she might be concerned that her buddy created a great many refugees himself while serving as commander-in-chief.\n\nWe are letting them down again: I fought alongside the Kurds. The United States can't abandon our fierce allies to Turkey.\n\nOn Tuesday, DeGeneres addressed the matter during a taping of her show, telling her audience, \u201cI'm friends with a lot of people who don't share the same beliefs that I have. We're all different, and I think we've forgotten that that's OK, that we're all different.\"\n\nThere was bipartisan praise for her message \u2014 \u201cBe kind to everyone\u201d \u2014 while some critics accused her of fence-sitting.\n\nThe sentiment has an enduring appeal and a seeming fairness: Surely mature adults can look past differences of opinion and treat one another with kindness and basic courtesy. It seems a bedrock democratic value; and yet, there are members of my family who no longer speak to each other over their feelings about the current president and the two dominant political parties.\n\nActions matter, not beliefs\n\nMeanwhile, popular discourse shows no interest in policy or principle, favoring personal vilification instead. The poison seeps into marriages, workplaces and friendships. The sentiment Ellen expressed addresses a personal confusion many of us feel.\n\nThe problem, as columnist Mehdi Hasan put it, is the second point: \u201cBush\u2019s beliefs are irrelevant here; his actions are what matters.\u201d\n\nJust as our celebrity culture deludes many into thinking they share a personal affinity with talk show celebrities, we also tend to cherish powerful figures no matter what destruction they wrought or what crimes they committed.\n\nWhat's happened since I blew the whistle: Mental health experts see Trump is dangerous, but our professional gatekeepers protect him\n\nIn 2013, for instance, comedian Stephen Colbert danced in the office of Henry Kissinger for a video, while the architect of carpet-bombing in Cambodia and numerous crimes against humanity looked on in avuncular bemusement.\n\nWe do not hold trials for war crimes; we make charming videos with the perpetrators. We give them civilian medals and honor them as statesmen and patriots. We hug them. This is a trans-partisan habit.\n\nSome regard it as kindness, yet true civility \u2014 while it may not police opinions or party affiliation \u2014 does require some moral clarity.\n\nIf actions matter, we might reconsider whether an administration that willingly killed hundreds of thousands, presented false evidence to justify war and occupation, and defended torture and domestic surveillance after covering them up is entitled to public esteem.\n\nAlgernon D'Ammassa is Desert Sage at Las Cruces Sun-News, where this column originally appeared.
