The UK has dragged its feet on suggesting anything concrete and only come up with \u201cconcepts\u201d, which diplomats say resemble the early thinking of Theresa May. There is a sense in the EU capital that the new team in Downing Street is having to re-learn the lessons Mr Johnson\u2019s predecessors took years to learn.\n\nThe increasing fever-pitch rhetoric in Westminster has not gone unnoticed in Brussels either. While Theresa May made few compromises for anyone other than the right wing of her party, she at least presented herself as doing so. Mr Johnson\u2019s approach, focused as it is on winning back Brexit Party voters for an election, does not bother with such window-dressing.\n\nThis month\u2019s antics with prorogation have also made some in diplomats privately question whether the UK is on the way to becoming a failed state. While the European Commission kept a low profile on the issue, it also did not go unnoticed.\n\nAgainst the backdrop, Wednesday\u2019s rhetoric of \u201csurrender\u201d coming from the prime minister provoked an unusually quick and forthright reaction from the commission. Julian King, the UK\u2019s own commissioner, suggested that such \u201ccrass\u201d talk would lead directly violence on Britain\u2019s streets. He was not talking out of line: when asked the next day about it all at a press briefing, a commission spokesperson delivered a sermon on \u201crespect\u201d.\n\nOne constant refrain from observers in Brussels is that Westminster doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate that the EU side watches the news and can see what is happening. They do not like what they see.", "description": "Boris Johnson has been prime minister for a few months now and the Brussels machine has now had time to get know him a bit.\u00a0 When Mr Johnson took office, diplomats and officials seemed genuinely willing to give the new prime minister a chance.
