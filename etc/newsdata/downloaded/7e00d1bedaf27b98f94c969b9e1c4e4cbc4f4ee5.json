Videos Reveal @CNN\u2019s BIAS!\u2019 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Does this sound like a good, or even great, lawsuit?\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s latest gripe with CNN comes after conservative activist group Project Veritas published undercover recordings from an alleged \u201cwhistleblower\u201d that capture CNN employees casually confirming the network's anti-Trump bias and show Zucker telling top news executives to focus solely on impeachment even at the expense of other important news.\n\nA request for comment from CNN on Trump's tweet was not immediately returned.\n\nPROJECT VERITAS' ALLEGED CNN WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS NETWORK IS 'PUMPING OUT PROPAGANDA'\n\nProject Veritas, whose founder, James O'Keefe, describes himself as a \u201cguerrilla journalist\u201d -- built up the release on social media with an \u201c#ExposeCNN\u201d hashtag, and Monday published the first segment of what is billed as a multi-part series. The video features Cary Poarch, who claims he was a satellite uplink technician at CNN\u2019s Washington Bureau before, he says, his \u201cdream job\u201d quickly turned into a nightmare due to CNN's blatant bias.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about the MSNBC event, OK? I don\u2019t care about them. Let\u2019s just stay very focused on impeachment,\u201d a person identified as Zucker says in the recording. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t just pretend, oh, this is going one way. And so all of these moves are toward impeachment.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPoarch allegedly recorded \u201cseveral\u201d of Zucker\u2019s conference calls, in which he claims Zucker runs the daily meeting \u201cwith an iron fist\u201d aimed directly at \u201chammering Trump\u201d or \u201cRepublicans in general.\u201d Poarch told O\u2019Keefe that several high-powered CNN executives join Zucker on the daily call, including senior vice president of newsgathering Virginia Moseley and political director David Chalian.\n\nZucker, who began his career at NBC, rose from researcher all the way to president and CEO of NBC Universal. Along the way, he was responsible for increasing Donald Trump\u2019s fame when he greenlighted \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d The duo has famously feuded since Trump\u2019s foray into politics, with the president attacking the liberal network on a regular basis and accusing CNN of unfair coverage.\n\nFox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report", "description": "President Trump\u00a0on Monday floated a lawsuit threat\u00a0against CNN over reports\u00a0that\u00a0the network\u2019s president, Jeff Zucker, launched an internal bias campaign to undermine his presidency.", "authors": ["Gerren Keith Gaynor", "Gerren Keith Gaynor Is A Digital Editor At Fox News.
