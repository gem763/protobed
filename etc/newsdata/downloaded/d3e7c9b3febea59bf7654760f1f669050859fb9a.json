(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nHouse Democrats on Monday subpoenaed Defense Secretary Mark Esper and acting White House budget director Russell Vought for documents pertaining to the impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\n\nThe inquiry focuses on a July phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump urged the Ukrainian premier to conduct an investigation into the business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of presidential candidate Joe Biden. Over a week before that conversation, Trump ordered the State Department and Pentagon to withhold a $391 military aid package destined for Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats have alleged Trump used the aid to pressure Zelensky into conducting an investigation that would damage Trump\u2019s political rival.\n\nThe chairmen of the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees, who are leading the investigation, sent letters to Esper and Vought in which they demanded the officials turn over documents relating to the decision to withhold aid from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe enclosed subpoena demands documents that are necessary for the committees to examine\u2026the reasons behind the White House\u2019s decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress to counter Russian aggression,\u201d committee heads Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.), and Elijah Cummings (D., Md.) wrote.\n\nCummings on Friday threatened to subpoena the White House for documents related to the impeachment inquiry if the White House did not comply with requests for the documents.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday rebuffed attempts by the committee heads to subpoena officials and documents from the State Department. The committee heads had requested five State Department officials to appear before the panels within a two week time frame, or they would consider the State Department to be obstructing justice. Pompeo dismissed the requests as \u201cbullying\u201d and intimidation, further charging that the requests had \u201csignificant legal and procedural concerns.\u201d", "description": "Letters that went to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and acting White House budget director Russell Vought demanded documents relating to aid from Ukraine.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Andrew C.
