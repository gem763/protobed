(Nash County Sheriff's Office) More\n\nThe Nash County Sheriff's Office searched Hancock's home on Thursday afternoon after a tip was passed along to them from a local crime fighting news site one week ago. The tip contained information about a missing persons case and the location of a possible body, police said.\n\nThe remains were found \"in a shallow grave wrapped in debris in the backyard\" of the home, Sheriff Keith Stone said at a press conference. The tip was \"consistent with the description of the wrapping and how the body was buried.\"\n\nThough the remains are currently working to be identified, police believe them to be Deans, who was 29 years old when she was last seen.\n\n(MORE: Police arrest suspect in decades-old cold case murder of 10-year-old girl after obtaining DNA sample)\n\nHancock was initially identified as a person of interest, but was later arrested and charged with first-degree murder after an \"in-depth interview,\" police said.\n\n\"We had several investigators talking to her, and were able to paint the picture of what actually happened 15 years ago,\" Chief Deputy Brandon Medina told ABC Durham, North Carolina, affiliate WTVD.\n\nPHOTO: Aerial footage of the home where the remains were found in Nash County, North Carolina.
