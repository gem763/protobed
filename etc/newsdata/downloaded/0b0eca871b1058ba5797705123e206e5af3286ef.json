For instance, they said, at one point an order was given to not distribute the reconstructed transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s call electronically, as would be typical. Instead, copies were printed out and hand delivered to a select group\u2026\n\nWhile the president saw nothing wrong with his request, officials who heard it quickly worried that it would be problematic at best and set about finding ways to keep the conversation hidden.\n\nThe electronic version of the reconstructed transcript produced from notes and voice recognition software was removed from the computer system where such documents are typically stored for distribution to cabinet-level officers, according to the complaint. Instead, it went into a classified system even though the call did not contain anything especially delicate in terms of national security information\u2026\n\nOther people close to the situation have said that among those angry at Mr. Giuliani\u2019s activities was John R. Bolton, who at the time was the president\u2019s national security adviser. He left the administration this month amid disagreements with Mr. Trump over Russia as well as other issues.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Trump-Ukraine-Timeline.Html"], "top_image": ""}
