He was taken away by ambulance.\n\nTrack veterinarian Dr. Dana Stead said in a statement that Emtech had two broken front legs and she made the decision to euthanize the colt on the track.\n\nWorkers hurried to put up a green screen to shield the foundering colt from the crowd, its front legs unable to withstand the animal's weight.\n\nDr. Dionne Benson, chief vet for The Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita, said a review would be opened to consider the factors that contributed to Emtech's injury.\n\nShe said the colt would have a necropsy at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, which is mandatory for all on-track accidents.\n\nEmtech, trained by Steve Knapp, went down in the middle of the track in the upper stretch of the six-furlong, $40,000 claiming race.\n\n\"There's an expected level of safety and accountability that is required to participate at a Stronach Group racetrack,\" according to a TSG statement. \"If anything less is found which could have contributed to this incident, it will be addressed immediately.\"\n\nThe fatalities at Santa Anita since Dec. 26 have raised alarm within California and the rest of the racing industry. The majority occurred during the winter months when usually arid Santa Anita was hit with record rainfall totaling nearly a foot. Gov. Gavin Newsom has made comments critical of the sport.\n\nGutierrez, a 32-year-old native of Mexico, won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness in 2012 aboard I'll Have Another and the Derby in 2016 with Nyquist.\n\nSent off at 15-1 odds, Emtech had two wins in five career starts and earnings of $47,151. He won his previous start Sept. 14 at Los Alamitos after being claimed for $25,000. The colt is owned by Steven Zolatas and Sabina Romo Zolatas.\n\nThe death occurred just before the day's two major stakes, both Breeders' Cup qualifying races.\n\n\u2014 Mongolian Groom, a 25-1 shot, upset favored McKinzie to win the $300,000 Awesome Again Stakes by 2 1/4 lengths.\n\nRidden by Abel Cedillo, Mongolian Groom ran 1 1/8 miles in 1:49.27 and paid $52.80 to win. The 4-year-old gelding earned an automatic berth in the $6 million BC Classic in November.\n\nMongolian Groom has three wins in 16 career starts.\n\nMcKinzie, the 1-5 favorite trained by Bob Baffert and ridden by Mike Smith, had already earned a spot in the BC Classic. He's finished first or second in 12 of 13 career starts, with his lone poor showing coming in last year's BC Classic when he was 12th.\n\nHigher Power was third and Seeking the Soul finished fourth.\n\n\u2014 Mirth won the $300,000 Rodeo Drive Stakes by 1 1/4 lengths under Smith.\n\nThat gives the 4-year-old filly trained by Phil D'Amato an automatic berth in the BC Filly & Mare Turf race.\n\nMirth ran 1 1/4 miles on turf in 1:58.47 and paid $14.20 to win at 6-1 odds.\n\nA pair of Ireland-breds, Beau Recall and Elysea's World, finished second and third.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Sports", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
