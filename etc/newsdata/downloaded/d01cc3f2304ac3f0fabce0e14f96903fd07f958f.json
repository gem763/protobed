A person with knowledge of the situation confirmed the booking to MMA Junkie following a report by Cageside Press.\n\nThe event does not yet have a location or name.\n\nUnlike many American fighters, Tennessee\u2019s Landwehr built his name and reputation abroad. In September 2017, \u201cThe Train\u201d made his debut for M-1 Global when he knocked out Mikhail Korobkov.\n\nAfter he defeated Viktor Kolesnik in his next outing, Landwehr finished champion Khamzat Dalgiev to earn the M-1 featherweight title. Entering his UFC debut, Landwehr is riding back-to-back title defenses against Andrey Lezhnev and Viktor Kolesnik.\n\nLandwehr\u2019s signing was made possible by an agreement made between M-1 and the UFC, which allows M-1 champions to get out of their contracts after their first title defense.\n\nFresh off of earning a contract at Dana White\u2019s Contender Series 23, Burns has won three straight fights against Darrick Minner, Luis Gomez, and Aibek Nurseit. Brother of UFC veteran Gilbert Burns, Herbert has won seven of his nine victories by way of submission.\n\nAt this time, no other fights have been announced for the Jan. 25 card.", "description": "Former M-1 Global featherweight champion Nate Landwehr will meet Brazil's Herbert Burns in a Jan. 25 matchup.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/landwehr.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
