her husband at age 17, her detention and trial were marred by claims she was a victim of domestic violence, and had been forced to make a false confession while she was denied access to a lawyer.\n\nMr Rehman said he was \u201calarmed\u201d by her execution, adding that her trial raised \u201cnumerous due process concerns.\u201d\n\nHe added that he \u201cappealed to the Iranian authorities to abolish the practice of sentencing children to death, and to commute all death sentences issued against children in line with international law.\n\nIn total 21 children have been sentenced to death since 2013, when the law was adapted to give judges the discretion to exempt children from the death penalty if they did not understand the nature of their actions.\n\nCommenting on the execution of Ms Sekaanvand earlier this month, Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said the \u201csheer injustice\u201d of the case was \u201cdeeply distressing\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe bottom line is that she was a juvenile at the time the offence was committed, and international law clearly prohibits the execution of juvenile offenders.\u201d", "description": "Iran has executed at least 12 child offenders since the start of 2018 while at least 90 are currently sitting on death row awaiting their punishment, the United
