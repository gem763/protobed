Its stock jumped as much as 5% in after-hours trading Wednesday after the company announced third-quarter results that soundly beat analysts\u2019 earnings estimates and topped revenue forecasts.\n\nThe social-networking giant reported third-quarter net income of $6.09 billion, or $2.12 a share, compared with $5.14 billion, or $1.76 a share, in the year-ago period.\n\nRevenue jumped 29% to $17.65 billion from $13.73 billion a year ago. Advertising sales accounted for 98% of total revenue, or $17.38 billion.\n\nAnalysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated $1.91 a share on revenue of $17.37 billion.\n\n\u201cWe had a good quarter and our community and business continue to grow,\u201d Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. \u201cWe are focused on making progress on major social issues and building new experiences that improve people\u2019s lives around the world.\u201d\n\nFacebook FB, -0.56% also announced the departure of board member Susan Desmond-Hellmann, CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, after six years for personal and health reasons. Her replacement to the seven-member board is expected \u201cover the coming months,\u201d Facebook said in an SEC filing.\n\nRead more: Facebook earnings: What distractions? Another strong quarter is expected\n\nMonthly active users (MAUs), a key barometer of the company\u2019s growth, improved 8% to 2.45 billion, as FactSet analysts predicted.\n\nAbout 2.8 billion people use Facebook and its properties, WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, each month, Zuckerberg said in a conference call following the earnings announcement.\n\nThe quarterly results underscore what has been a consistent story arc throughout the year: Despite a Federal Trade Commission investigation into its business practices, a record $5 billion fine from the FTC this year for privacy violations, and a conga line of angry politicians calling for it to be sliced and diced, Facebook continues to post solid results. The same has largely held true for the other big tech companies facing regulatory scrutiny: Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.01% , Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.98% , and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, +0.00% GOOG, -0.11% Google division.\n\n\u201cWe face major regulatory and social issues,\u201d Zuckerberg acknowledged during the conference call. He repeated his preference for a \u201cvery set level\u201d of federal rules.\n\n\u201cA lot of the antitrust questions out there will be about our acquisition of Instagram,\u201d Zuckerberg said in response to one analyst\u2019s question. \u201cBut we think [its business] was a lot more complementary than we thought... At the end of the day, it is the FTC\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Facebook co-founder took the opportunity on the conference call to double down on the company\u2019s recent advocacy of free speech and expression, particularly in political ads as the 2020 presidential campaign intensifies. \u201cOver the next year of campaigns, we will be at the center of the debate,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect this will be a very difficult year... but this is complex stuff.\u201d He added that political ads will comprise less than 0.5% of total revenue in 2020.\n\nBut not all the numbers for Facebook are rosy.\n\nDuring the conference call, Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner warned of \u201cpronounced deceleration\u201d in Q4 revenue amid overlapping products and \u201cad-targeting headwinds.\u201d He noted a 32% hike in third-quarter costs and expenses, to $10.5 billion.\n\nThen there is actual use of the core Facebook product. Americans are spending 26% less time on Facebook than they did two years ago, and they\u2019re increasingly using other social networks as an alternative, according to a new study by market researcher Active Inc.\n\nFacebook users spent on average of nearly 13 hours a month on the platform in 2017; today, that figure is down to 9.28 hours, said Active. At the same time, social-media users in the U.S. belong to 5.8 different social-media networks; by 2023, it\u2019s predicted to be 10.\n\nFacebook\u2019s stock is up 44% this year, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.33% has gained 21%.", "description": "Shares of Facebook Inc. jumped 5% in after-hours trading Wednesday after it announced third-quarter results that soundly beat analysts\u2019 earnings estimates...", "authors": ["Jon Swartz", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT874_Facebo_ZG_20191023133944.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
