We are no further forward than where we were this time last week.\n\n\u2018Part of me is feeling like it was just a publicity stunt on the UK government side to show they are trying to help.\n\n\u2018But, although he is engaging with us, we have no answers. We are really frustrated that we could spend half an hour or more with him and just come out with nothing.\u2019\n\nMr Seiger added that they now plan to launch a civil case against Mrs Sacoolas in America.\n\n\u2018Our position is that she doesn\u2019t have immunity and that waivers are always granted in these circumstances,\u2019 Radd Seiger told reporters in Westminster.\n\n\u2018Now we can disclose to you we have brought lawyers on board. We are going to Washington soon to help us get that justice for Harry.\u2019\n\nThe suspect in the crash, Anne Sacoolas, is reportedly married to a US intelligence official and claimed diplomatic immunity (Picture: Sky News)\n\nTributes to the teenager left near the base (Picture: Getty)\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, Mr Raab and Northamptonshire Police have asked the US to consider waiving the immunity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has since emerged that Mrs Sacoolas was previously handed a fine for \u2018failure to pay full time and attention\u2019 while driving in the state of Virginia in 2006.\n\nPrior to meeting the US Ambassador, Mr Raab raised the case in a telephone call with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s meeting, a Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \u2018The Foreign Secretary met the US Ambassador today and urged the US to reconsider its position and do the right thing by Harry Dunn\u2019s family.\u2019\n\nOn Monday, the Prime Minister also urged the US to reconsider its decision to give immunity to the diplomat\u2019s wife, saying: \u2018I do not think it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose.\u2019\n\nNorthamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley said US authorities had been appealed to in \u2018the strongest terms\u2019 to apply a waiver and \u2018allow the justice process to take place\u2019 after Mrs Sacoolas left the UK despite telling officers she did not plan to do so.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
