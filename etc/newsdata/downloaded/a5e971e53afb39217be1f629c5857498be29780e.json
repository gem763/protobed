Stephen Curry scored 23 points on Sunday, making seven of 18 shots while his teammates made just 23 of 74. Golden State were coming off a season-opening 141-122 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. At least that defeat was against arguably the best team in the NBA \u2013 on Sunday they lost 120-92 to the rebuilding Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nKevin Durant left the Warriors for Brooklyn in the offseason and Klay Thompson is likely out for the season with a torn left ACL. Still, Golden State expected to be more competitive early in the season.\n\nNBA 2019-20 predictions: The rise of Los Angeles and the era of the super duos Read more\n\n\u201cThe reality is we fucking suck right now ... We\u2019re just not that good right now,\u201d said Draymond Green after the game. \u201cI don\u2019t know what better way to frame it. I can try in Spanish, but I ain\u2019t really that good at Spanish.\u201d\n\nAnthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) Draymond Green: \u201cThe reality is we fucking suck right now...We just not that good right now. I don\u2019t know what better way to frame it. I can try in Spanish, but I ain\u2019t really that good at Spanish.\u201d pic.twitter.com/itJIROvLG1\n\nThe Warriors, who have won the NBA title in three of the last five seasons, allowed the Thunder to shoot 56% from the field after allowing the Clippers to shoot 63%. \u201cEverybody loved our offense, but it wasn\u2019t our offense that was making us great,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt was our defense. I\u2019ve said that for years. Our defense right now is nonexistent. I don\u2019t even think we know what defense is right now.\u201d\n\nIt was a heartening result for Thunder fans, who have been looking for something to cling to after the Thunder traded away longtime star Russell Westbrook for Chris Paul in the offseason. The blowout matched Oklahoma City\u2019s largest margin of victory over the Warriors since the franchise moved from Seattle before the 2008-09 season. The fact that the breakthrough came against the Warriors didn\u2019t mean much to Paul.\n\n\u201cI think it was more about us, not about them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have an identity. How we are going to play defensively and offensively? Pushing the pace, moving the ball and playing with the right spirit.\u201d\n\nNow, Paul and Westbrook will face off Monday night in Houston. Paul said it might be a bit awkward, but he won\u2019t make a big deal about it. \u201cIt\u2019ll be my first time back there since I got traded so you know, it\u2019s another game,\u201d he said. \u201cMove on. See a couple familiar faces say what up to my man the equipment manager. Keep it pushing.\u201d", "description": "The Oklahoma City Thunder recorded a 120-92 victory over a Golden State Warriors team facing up to a changed NBA landscape", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91e7a84812f364400c6f5bb112d68bbebf87780a/0_119_3111_1867/master/3111.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=38cd0d776a6c537a4cd37281b0da8d8c", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
