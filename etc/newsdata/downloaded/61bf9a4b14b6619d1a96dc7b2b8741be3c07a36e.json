As the Nationals second baseman battled, Greinke painted the outside corners with a variety of pitches. The Houston Astros ace opened with a curveball, then threw two fastballs and mixed in a slider for good measure.\n\nBut it was the fifth pitch of the at-bat \u2014 a 67.8 mph curveball \u2014 that left Cabrera befuddled. The 33-year-old swung through, only for the ball to sink on the way down as Houston escaped the inning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy, man,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. This game is never easy.\u201d\n\nDespite getting on base in eight out of nine innings, the Nationals couldn\u2019t get a timely hit Friday as they lost 4-1 in Game 3 of the World Series. Washington still leads the Fall Classic 2-1, but it was unable to take advantage of 10 runners in scoring position (RISP). The Nationals had nine hits and left 12 men on base.\n\nThe last time a team went 0-for-10 with RISP in the World Series was the Philadelphia Phillies in 2008.\n\nWashington\u2019s lone run came in the bottom of the fourth when center fielder Victor Robles had an RBI triple to score first baseman Ryan Zimmerman.\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of traffic on the bases,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cAny time you can get that many people on base and have that many opportunities, that\u2019s the name of the game. At some point, you just got to get a big hit and sometimes that opens the flood gates. (But) you gotta give them credit. They made good pitches when they needed to.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do it every night.\u201d\n\nIt was startling to see because for much of this postseason \u2014 the entire year, even \u2014 the Nationals thrived in similar scenarios. Entering Friday\u2019s game, they were 46 of 86 in scoring position, good for a league-best .314 batting average. In the regular season, Washington scored more runs than any other team with runners on with 658. The next closest team was the New York Yankees with 623, a 35-run differential.\n\nThe Nationals, though, generally seemed pleased with their at-bats. Players saw a silver lining in how the game unfolded as Greinke lasted only 4 \u2154 innings \u2014 leaving Houston to rely on its bullpen for the rest of the night.\n\nThis especially mattered because the Astros had planned to heavily use their relievers in Game 4. Throughout the season, Houston had gone without a reliable fourth-starter as its strength was riding Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander and Greinke. After Friday\u2019s win, Astros manager A.J. Hinch announced Jos\u00e9 Urquidy, who has only pitched 4 \u2153 innings in two appearances this postseason, will start Game 4.\n\n\u201cHe can go as long as he\u2019s good,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cI don\u2019t have necessarily a predetermined plan on how many innings, how many pitches.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, three of Houston\u2019s key relievers \u2014 Brad Peacock, Will Harris and Joe Smith \u2014 threw 21, 25 and 18 pitches, respectively. Controversial closer Roberto Osuna, who was arrested in 2018 on domestic violence charges (later dropped), made his series debut and threw 16 pitches. Hinch did not say how many of those pitchers will be available for Saturday.\n\nStill, the Nationals missed a chance to take a commanding 3-0 lead. Against Greinke, they struggled to adjust to the pitcher\u2019s variance. Manager Dave Martinez said his players were too aggressive outside the strike zone and sat on pitches they typically try to hit. Star third baseman Anthony Rendon uncharacteristically swung on first pitches in three of his four plate appearances.\n\nThe Nationals\u2018 inability to produce left the sold-out crowd of 43,867 disappointed. From the start, the fans at Nationals Park were amped up \u2014 eager to see the city\u2019s first World Series home game in 86 years. They clapped along to \u201cBaby Shark\u201d when Gerardo Parra pinch-hit in the sixth inning for catcher Kurt Suzkui. They even serenaded Juan Soto with \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to celebrate his 21st birthday when he first took his place in left field.\n\nSoto, however, went 0-for-4. In the ninth, he struck out looking \u2014 ending the game.\n\n\u201cWe just missed it when we (needed) it,\u201d Soto said, \u201cbut tomorrow is another day.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
