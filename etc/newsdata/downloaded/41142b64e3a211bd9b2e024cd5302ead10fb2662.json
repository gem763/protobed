As Lorenzo Reyes details, the league's elite class is starting to crystalize. USA TODAY\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 Travis Kelce didn\u2019t blame fill-in quarterback Matt Moore for the incomplete pass on third-and-3.\n\nThe tight end refused to entertain the idea that Chiefs coach Andy Reid had made the wrong decision to punt on fourth-and-3, down 31-24, with 5:13 to play in the fourth quarter.\n\nKelce was adamant when asked where Kansas City, now 5-3, can improve on offense without MVP Patrick Mahomes.\n\n\u201cI have to be better for Matty Moore there at the end, coming back to the ball,\u201d Kelce said sullen-faced from his locker after 31-24 loss. \u201cBetter for my teammates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just disgusted with how I played.\u201d\n\nMoore replaced Patrick Mahomes against the Broncos on Oct. 17 after the league\u2019s reigning MVP dislocated his right kneecap. Kelce said then that he had never caught a pass from Moore, who had not even thrown Kelce a pass in practice.\n\nAgainst the Packers, in their first game after practicing together, Kelce caught four of eight targets, totaling 63 receiving yards and a touchdown. The 29-yard endzone lob Kelce hauled in from Moore in the second quarter not only signified the Chiefs\u2019 first points of the night. It also kicked off a 17-point quarter that sent the Chiefs into halftime with a 17-14 lead.\n\nChiefs tight end Travis Kelce reacts after missing a pass against the Packers.

The Packers would not have been able to bleed the final 5:04 of the clock as Kelce and the offense watched helplessly from the sideline.\n\nKelce regretted the missed opportunities.\n\n\u201cHave to catch the ball when I\u2019m in the end zone,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cI should\u2019ve caught the ball on third-and-whatever.\u201d\n\nOn the four targets he did secure, he netted three first downs and a score. But as a four-time Pro Bowl tight end with a 70.4 percent career catch rate, Kelce expects more from himself than catching half the balls thrown his way.\n\nHe expects himself to rise to the occasion on plays like third-and-3, down a score, with 5:13 to play on Sunday Night Football against Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.\n\nKelce left Arrowhead disappointed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look at film and figure out how to get better,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cBut I have to be better for my team in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
