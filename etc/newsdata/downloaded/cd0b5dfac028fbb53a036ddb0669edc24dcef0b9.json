In the bodycam footage, the officer repeatedly shouts \"You're done\" at her and then says \"You're not going to assault the principal\" before he's seen pushing the 11-year-old against a wall and demanding she put her hands behind her back.\n\nWhile the officer tries to handcuff her, the girl is heard telling him he's hurting her. Christensen ultimately wrestles the girl to the ground, and she can be heard crying out as he demands she turn over and warns her, \"Do not resist.\"\n\nSomeone watching the incident unfold tells the officer to stop and says he's used \"excessive force.\" The child, according to KRQE, suffered a concussion and has arm and shoulder pain due to the incident.\n\nChristensen reportedly said he tried to arrest the girl because that morning, \"she went straight to the cafeteria, she took more milks than she was supposed to, she threw a milk on the ground. I mean, they try to say something she just walks off.\"\n\nIn the body camera footage, the girl tells the officer her mom is at the school and she wants to go home, but the officer tells her she's not allowed to leave and is being charged with assault and resisting.\n\nST.

Hebbe said the officer was up-to-date on his use-of-force training, but said the department is \"trying to figure out where we could have done a better job and what things I need to do as far as training and policies to do a better job in the future.\"\n\nThe case has been referred to the New Mexico State Police for possible criminal charges.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A New Mexico police officer resigned earlier this month after body camera footage showed him\u00a0throwing an 11-year-old girl to the ground after she had an alleged altercation with the school principal \u2014 which was reportedly\u00a0sparked when\u00a0she took more milk from the cafeteria than she was supposed to.", "authors": ["Nicole Darrah", "Nicole Darrah Covers Breaking", "Trending News For Foxnews.Com.
