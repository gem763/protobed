Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.\n\n\u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026It sounds horrible to me,\u201d Trump said, according to the declassified transcript.\n\nThe 2020 Democratic presidential contender vowed that he would \"continue to focus my campaign not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America's families.\"\n\nDEMS DOBULE DOWN ON IMPEACHMENT AFTER UKRAINE TRANSCRIPT RELEASE, DESCRIBE CALL AS MAFIA-STYLE 'SHAKEDOWN'\n\nBiden also urged Congress to forge ahead with impeachment proceedings, saying \"Congress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable.\"\n\nBiden called the transcript, which isn't a verbate of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky but rather a summary of \u201cnotes and recollections\" from the conversation an \"abridged version that the White House was willing to issue to the public.\"\n\n\"Congress is entitled to the full whistleblower complaint, and any and all other information about this matter,\" he added.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. who is spearheading the impeachment inquiry, set a Thursday deadline for the White House and State Department to turn over the related whistleblower complaint and other information related to the phone call but warned that the committee would issue a subpoena if the request wasn't fulfilled.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden further accused Trump of putting \"his own political interests over our national security interest, which is bolstering Ukraine against Russian pressure.\"\n\n\"This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It is a national security issue,\" Biden said.\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden hit back at President Trump, accusing him of putting\u00a0\"personal politics above his sacred oath\" after\u00a0transcripts of a controversial call between the commander-in-chief\u00a0and the president of Ukraine were released by the White House on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
