Then It Disappeared.", "language": "en", "text": "As the Halloween dance rages \u2014 a gymnasium of high schoolers in cheap costumes bouncing around to the sounds of The Offspring \u2014 one teen arrives with murder on the brain. Anton (Devon Sawa) cuts through the crowd, vaults onstage and waves the bleeding stump of his arm at his schoolmates.\n\n\u201cEverybody go home! There\u2019s a psycho killer here!\u201d he shouts, as annoyed kids laugh and pelt him with garbage. \u201cI cut off my hand, and it\u2019s going to kill you all!\u201d The lead singer wrestles the mic away from Anton and tries to restart the show, but he can\u2019t: The possessed, bodiless hand has dropped onto his head and ripped off his scalp.\n\nThis is the climax of \u201cIdle Hands,\u201d a horror-comedy about a happy-go-lucky stoner too baked to realize that his hand has been possessed by a demon until well into his appendage\u2019s murder spree. By this point in the movie, his hand has brutally killed his parents and his two best friends, who are resurrected as wisecracking zombies. He finally cut his hand off, only to realize that this wouldn\u2019t put an end to the rampage. Once the lead singer of The Offspring has been summarily dispatched, a bloody night at the once-idyllic high school begins. The ensuing mayhem, all peppered with jokes, leaves students dead or horribly maimed.\n\n\u201cIdle Hands\u201d opened in U.S. theaters on April 30, 1999. Ten days earlier, two seniors had entered Columbine High School in Colorado, each bearing two guns, and murdered 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves. For critics, film executives and American society at large, the unhappy coincidence forced the question: Was the movie not just bad, but wrong?\n\n\u201cIf timing is everything, then the recent carnage at Columbine High School indicates that now could scarcely be less opportune for the opening of \u2018Idle Hands,\u2019\u201d wrote Lawrence Van Gelder in The New York Times. The Hartford Courant\u2019s Malcolm Johnson was blunter: His review appeared under the blaring headline \u201cWHY WAS THIS MOVIE EVEN MADE?\u201d\n\nColumbia Pictures executives met prior to the release to discuss \u201cwhether it might be prudent to move the release date of \u2018Idle Hands,\u2019 for fear of offending the public\u2019s still-raw sensibilities,\u201d according to CNN. Instead, they issued a statement insisting that the film bore \u201cno resemblance to that tragedy.\u201d The movie opened on schedule.\n\nEven the framing of that question \u2014 the concept that moving the release date back a few weeks could sufficiently remove the specter of real-life mass murder from the public\u2019s mind to protect the film\u2019s reception \u2014 seems painfully quaint in 2019, when the threat of mass shootings is unrelenting.\n\nBut back then, \u201cIdle Hands\u201d was not an outlier.\n\n1999 saw several other teen comedies revolving around gruesome violence in and around schools, like \u201cDrop Dead Gorgeous.\u201d In August, the release of \u201cTeaching Mrs. Tingle\u201d (pre-Columbine title: \u201cKilling Mrs. Tingle\u201d) still faced a raw, grieving public. \u201cJawbreaker,\u201d a \u201cHeathers\u201d retread about a trio of popular teen girls who accidentally kill their best friend by gagging her with a jawbreaker during a playful birthday \u201ckidnapping,\u201d narrowly avoided direct comparison to Columbine by hitting theaters two months before the massacre, in February. (Reviews were nonetheless unkind.) And then there were the edgy 1999 comedies for teens that didn\u2019t feature explicit gore, like \u201cElection\u201d and \u201cBut I\u2019m a Cheerleader.\u201d\n\nWhat made 1999 the year of the dark teen comedy? And why has the genre nearly disappeared from theaters in the ensuing two decades?\n\nIt\u2019s facile to suggest that innocence existed pre-1999 and that we collectively lost it at the turning of the millennium. And yet it does seem telling that prior to Columbine, the Sept. 11 attacks and the ensuing invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq \u2015 and a host of other destabilizing events, including two major economic bubble collapses in the early aughts \u2015 American moviemakers felt comfortable mixing their teen angst and violence with their teen camp and comedy. As the reality of even middle-class American teens looks unremittingly hellish, perhaps turning their pain into humor seems tasteless. Meanwhile, the entire movie industry has shifted strategies. It\u2019s been years since blockbusters aimed primarily at teens have looked like a reliable investment.\n\nThe releases of 1999 were suffused with a cynical, morbid wit that now seems largely absent from teen movies.\n\n1999 was a golden year overall for teen film, rich with silver screen romps for and about the high school set, including sweeter-natured flicks like \u201cAmerican Pie,\u201d \u201c10 Things I Hate About You\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s All That.\u201d It had daffy sexcapades and candy-bright rom-coms and teary melodramas. This may have been the high-water mark of the John Hughes-esque teen flick, soon to be subsumed by a tidal wave of fantasy sagas and superhero franchises.\n\nBut while high school comedies haven\u2019t gone away, the releases of 1999 were also suffused with a cynical, morbid wit that now seems largely absent from teen movies. Contemporary observers noted \u2014 not always appreciatively \u2015 that films blending grim subject matter and comedic tone were having a bit of a moment. Dennis Lim, then a critic for the Village Voice, called \u201cTeaching Mrs. Tingle\u201d \u201cyet another black comedy that misunderstands and misrepresents the genre \u2014 call them Very Bad Jawbreakers.\u201d Upon watching \u201cTeaching Mrs. Tingle\u201d for the first time this year, I had to agree: The motivations and mechanics of the student-on-teacher revenge plot are as distractingly flimsy as an airplane made of cardboard.\n\nFilm booms don\u2019t come out of nowhere, and those cynical twists on high school comedy had clear roots in the classic John Hughes formula, argues Catherine Driscoll, a professor of gender and cultural studies at the University of Sydney and author of \u201cTeen Film: A Critical Introduction.\u201d In his slew of wildly popular mid-\u201980s teen movies \u2014 including \u201cPretty in Pink,\u201d \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d and \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d \u2014 Hughes depicted an adolescent world that was normatively middle-class, suburban, white and rooted in the social ecosystem of the high school, a place where teenage self-discovery and connection must find its way around the obstacles of social stereotypes, cliques and neglectful or antagonistic adults.\n\nDark teen movies like \u201cTeaching Mrs. Tingle,\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m a Cheerleader\u201d and \u201cElection\u201d \u2014 not to mention precursors like \u201cHeathers\u201d \u2014 are \u201cangsty inversions of the staples of the \u201980s American teen film,\u201d Driscoll said in a phone interview. Dark teen comedies weren\u2019t birthed in response to John Hughes \u2014 arguable precursors include 1971\u2019s \u201cHarold and Maude\u201d and 1966\u2019s \u201cLord Love a Duck\u201d \u2014 but many of those that followed his heyday, she said, reacted more specifically to \u201cconventions about high school and suburban life and domestic closure on growing up [that] became way tighter around John Hughes in particular.\u201d Some popular teen movies in 1999, like \u201cShe\u2019s All That\u201d and \u201c10 Things I Hate About You,\u201d drew from the Hughes formula, while others aggressively subverted it.\n\nTake \u201cBut I\u2019m a Cheerleader,\u201d in which heroine Megan Bloomfield (Natasha Lyonne) fits so perfectly into her social category, with her blond hair, neat skirts and football-player boyfriend, that her true self is masked not only from others but from herself. Even when her family and loved ones stage an intervention, pointing to all the signs that she\u2019s actually a lesbian, she remains firmly in denial. The consequences of not adhering to her social category, meanwhile, are far more severe than a Hughes-standard diss at a party: She\u2019s packed off to a grotesque reeducation camp where gay and lesbian teens learn to be straight through dating simulations and enforced blue and pink uniforms. (Though the term isn\u2019t used in the film, this is, of course, a satirical depiction of a real, extremely damaging process called conversion therapy.)\n\nWhere a Hughes movie might have gently led its characters into a new awareness that their superficial differences shouldn\u2019t define them, Megan is ejected from the ecosystem until her deeper differences can be removed, making her compatible with normal high school life again. Only when this happens will her family and friends accept her back. In the end, she chooses to reject the entire paradigm and embrace her love for another girl, overthrowing high school conformity at great personal cost.\n\n\n\n\u201cElection\u201d and \u201cTeaching Mrs. Tingle,\u201d like \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d and, to a lesser extent, \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d hinge on a conflict between a teenage student and a malicious school authority figure. In \u201cElection,\u201d the feud takes on a darker hue through the disturbing willingness of Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) to harm other students in her quest for power, but also through the juxtaposition against Mr. McAllister (Matthew Broderick) with his wholesome, if rather sweaty, teacher persona and his dangerous moral vacuity. Not only does he blame Tracy for the firing of his best friend, another teacher who sexually groomed and assaulted her, but he transmutes that resentment and his own repressed desire for her into a childish, Mr. Rooney-esque vendetta. In \u201cElection,\u201d a teacher can do more than threaten a wayward kid with Saturday detention or needless insults; he can rape her, manipulate her or use her own victimhood to justify derailing her future. Based on a novel by Tom Perrotta and clearly geared toward an adult audience as well, \u201cElection\u201d punctures both the trope of the endlessly lovable or blameless student and the comforting sense that there\u2019s a limit to the harm a teacher can inflict on even a loathed pupil.\n\n\u201cTeaching Mrs. Tingle\u201d also parodically, if less deftly, engages the trope of a wise teenager exposing and humiliating a teacher who threatens the kid\u2019s future. \u201cJawbreaker\u201d and \u201cDrop Dead Gorgeous\u201d turn the standard depiction of high school as a festering pit of backbiting popularity contests into something a bit more deadly. \u201cIdle Hands\u201d riffs unevenly on the slacker comedy.\n\nIt\u2019s not that it took until 1999 for these reactions to \u201980s teen movies to gestate; that happened almost immediately. \u201cConsider the biggest teen movies in the years before 1999 were full of satire and self-critique,\u201d Timothy Shary, a film scholar and author of \u201cGeneration Multiplex: American Youth in Cinema Since 1980,\u201d told HuffPost in an email. \u201cJawbreaker\u201d was derided at the time as a (weak) imitation of 1989\u2019s \u201cHeathers.\u201d Besides, a comedy doesn\u2019t have to be as morbid as \u201cTeaching Mrs. Tingle\u201d or as cynical as \u201cElection\u201d to comment ironically on genre conventions. Shary pointed out that movies like \u201cClueless\u201d and the \u201cScream\u201d series also fit this mold.\n\nEven Hughes\u2019 own movies could be pointedly self-aware. In \u201cFerris Bueller,\u201d the school secretary approvingly notes that the title character is beloved by all the niche cliques: \u201cThe sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wastoids, dweebies, dickheads \u2015 they all adore him. They think he\u2019s a righteous dude.\u201d That a prim secretary would so matter-of-factly sort students into reductive, stereotypical groups can be nothing but a wry meta-commentary. By 1999, this self-conscious \u201980s-style high school film was well-entrenched in the industry pipeline \u2015 both the standard-issue comedies like \u201cShe\u2019s All That\u201d and the edgier counterparts \u2015 and the pump was primed for a major spurt of angsty comedy.\n\nDesperate to understand and prevent another Columbine, politicians and the media didn\u2019t miss the alarming reality that movies may contain violence \u2015 even violence inflicted by and on teens.\n\nBut with the subgenre in the midst of its boom year, things took a turn. Many of the films hadn\u2019t even made it to theaters before the country\u2019s mood started to shift. Columbine was not the first school shooting in the United States \u2014 far from it \u2014 but at the time, it was the most deadly mass shooting in a high school, and it inflicted a deep psychic wound on the nation.\n\nDesperate to understand and prevent another Columbine, politicians and the media didn\u2019t miss the alarming reality that movies may contain violence \u2015 even violence inflicted by and on teens. In addition to pinning culpability on school bullying, Marilyn Manson, metal bands and video games, a panicky public noted that the two shooters had been obsessed with bloody films like \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d and \u201cNatural Born Killers.\u201d\n\nIn June of that year, President Bill Clinton requested a Federal Trade Commission investigation into whether violent entertainment was being marketed to viewers under 17. (The report, issued in September, unsurprisingly concluded that it was.) Clinton also announced that movie theaters would crack down on teens under 17 sneaking into R-rated films by instituting a photo ID policy. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to worry about your G-rated kids getting into violent or suggestive R-rated movies,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nThough teen movies like \u201cHeathers\u201d don\u2019t seem to have been credibly linked to the shooting, the fact that films with the same blackly comic, violent edge as \u201cNatural Born Killers\u201d were being made for and about teenagers rubbed some people the wrong way. For critics who took issue with films like \u201cIdle Hands,\u201d it wasn\u2019t just the fact that they depicted violence in the classroom or the high school dance, but the manner of it: insufficiently somber, excessively fun. Johnson, in his Hartford Courant review, called \u201cIdle Hands\u201d \u201ca rotten and tasteless piece of cinematic junk,\u201d made \u201cvirtually unwatchable\u201d due to the close proximity to Columbine. Roger Ebert wrote: \u201cThere is nothing funny about the situation in \u201cTeaching Mrs. Tingle.\u201d\n\nThese films gleefully blended comedy into the macabre, squeezing laughs from adolescents dealing with murder, sexual manipulation and abuse, and other traumatizing experiences. It\u2019s an odd coincidence, in retrospect, that a boomlet of murderous teen comedies hit American theaters the very same year that Columbine became a symbolic signpost welcoming white, middle-class Americans to a world in which their kids were not safe at school. Though some \u2015 like \u201cElection\u201d \u2015 fared better with critics, this was certainly not an ideal time for a studio to release a bad or even mediocre dark comedy about teen carnage.\n\nMovies in the mold of \u2018Idle Hands\u2019 haven\u2019t seemed like a smart investment in the post-Columbine years, especially as deadly mass shootings have become a tragically mundane occurrence.\n\nThe effect appears to have been lasting, at least for Hollywood.\n\n\u201cWe have seen far fewer depictions of delinquency after Columbine and the wave of school shootings in the late \u201990s,\u201d Shary told HuffPost. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to make a teen film about a school shooting now, it\u2019s going to be like \u2018Elephant,\u2019\u201d said Driscoll, referring to the 2003 drama. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an exploration of how this happens.\u201d Movies in the mold of \u201cIdle Hands\u201d haven\u2019t seemed like a smart investment in the post-Columbine years, especially as deadly mass shootings have become a tragically mundane occurrence.\n\nWitness the travails of Paramount\u2019s \u201cHeathers\u201d TV reboot, originally slated to premiere in March 2018. It was postponed after the horrifying shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, left 17 dead that February. In June, Paramount dropped the show, having been stymied in its plan for a July premiere date, according to The Hollywood Reporter, by a shooting at Houston-area Santa Fe High School in which eight students and two teachers died.\n\n\u201cThe combination of a high school show with these very dark moments didn\u2019t feel right,\u201d Paramount executive Keith Cox told THR. In the fall, having failed to unload the show on another distributor, Paramount started to air a re-cut version of the season, only to pull several episodes after the massacre at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life Synagogue. The show whimpered its way from a splashy TV event to a series available to stream on Paramount\u2019s website without ever fully making it to air.\n\nThe turn of the millennium brought other fresh hells \u2015 most notably, the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the dawning of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. The world looked not simply corrupt and grotesque, as the antics of the Clinton era may have suggested, but mortally terrifying. Wringing laughs out of kids in peril may simply have struck too close to home, especially for their parents.\n\nNot that dark themes have been expurgated from teen movies. Instead of exploring the trauma inflicted by conversion therapy through a blunt satire like \u201cBut I\u2019m a Cheerleader,\u201d sweetening the pill with a few laughs, contemporary filmmakers typically dive directly into the pain with moody dramas like \u201cBoy Erased.\u201d Though Driscoll emphasized that a well-done dark comedy on the topic could be made today, she suggested that \u201cBut I\u2019m a Cheerleader\u201d would seem \u201chistorically out of place\u201d if created now, \u201cjust because the dominant narratives about adolescent sexuality have shifted.\u201d\n\nShary argued that recent hits like \u201cThe Hate U Give,\u201d \u201cLady Bird\u201d and \u201cEighth Grade\u201d have shown that if twisted comedies are out, \u201crealism is in.\u201d The shift in pop cultural norms \u2015 toward acceptance and understanding of racial, gender and size diversity, mental illness and neurodiversity, disability rights, and beyond \u2015 has likely encouraged studios and creators to handle adolescent issues with a gentle, serious touch. Even light-hearted \u201990s comedies look hard-edged compared to recent teen hits like \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before,\u201d which lead with empathy and softness.\n\n\u201cFilmmakers are clearly reflecting youths\u2019 interest in social tolerance, sexual exploration, intense friendships and realistic school struggles,\u201d Shary said. \u201cUnlike they\u2019re given credit for, I think many youth today actually want to deal with life rather than escape it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the teenage predilection for irreverent, even morbid humor hasn\u2019t entirely gone away. The shift has been in where they explore these interests. In 1999, the moral panic may have revolved around violence in the movies and metal music; now, it\u2019s the online cesspools where adolescents snicker over fascist memes and flirt with sincerely embracing bigoted views.\n\nCynical and bloody riffs on teen comedies were never the safest route to a massive payday.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the teens or the political times that have changed. The film industry itself has undergone a tectonic shift since 1999.\n\n\u201cIt used to be a truism in writing about the film industry that the adolescent was your core audience,\u201d Driscoll said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t the ones with the most money, but they were the ones who went back to the movies most often. Now that\u2019s not really true in the same way. Now, [with] the expense of the movies and the scale of the movies, you need a family frame, first of all, where you get adults and children at the same time. It\u2019s got to work for dates. It\u2019s got to work for taking your kids in holidays.\u201d\n\nAll-ages spectacles like superhero and sci-fi sagas often incorporate adolescent themes of rebellion and coming of age, she noted, but they\u2019re not as tailored to the youth audience alone.\n\nThe old-style teen comedy blockbusters still pop up \u2014 \u201cEasy A,\u201d \u201cBlockers\u201d \u2014 and some are even gritty and angsty \u2014 \u201cJennifer\u2019s Body,\u201d \u201cThe Bling Ring.\u201d But they\u2019re no longer a standby for studios that can instead churn out another superhero reboot and rake in ticket sales from teens as well as their parents and older siblings. In a world where every major studio release needs to appeal to every demographic, teen-specific movies are no longer big business. And though it may be true, as Shary said, that \u201cteens love sarcasm more than slapstick,\u201d speaking specifically to that demographic\u2019s rebellious, cynical sense of humor is a tricky proposition for studios that hope to sell tickets to those teens\u2019 parents as well. The wilds of 4chan, conversely, need not adhere to family-oriented standards of taste.\n\nThe simplest explanation, of course, may be the best: Of all those dark teen comedies that premiered in 1999, none was a box office hit (perhaps excepting \u201cCruel Intentions,\u201d which is arguably not a comedy). While the cheery \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s All That\u201d were bonafide smashes, \u201cIdle Hands,\u201d with a budget of $25 million, grossed under $5 million domestically. \u201cJawbreaker,\u201d \u201cDrop Dead Gorgeous,\u201d \u201cGo,\u201d \u201cElection\u201d and \u201cTeaching Mrs. Tingle\u201d came closer to breaking even, but none could be termed a financial winner. Perhaps the post-Columbine anxiety dampened sales, or perhaps the genre is just better suited to producing cult favorites than smash hits. Even the iconic \u201cHeathers,\u201d released in 1989, grossed only a million dollars. Perhaps the industry didn\u2019t even have to change, though it did. Cynical and bloody riffs on teen comedies were never the safest route to a massive payday.\n\nAnd yet in 1999, studios were still taking chances on the genre. They may again. Driscoll and Shary agreed that, some permanent historical shifts aside, trends in teen entertainment tend to be cyclical. \u201cThere is a moment at the end of the \u201990s where there\u2019s a confluence of things that make that kind of dark teen film really successful,\u201d Driscoll said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not the first time that was the case and it won\u2019t be the last.\u201d\n\nThe late \u201990s saw an era of adolescent filmgoer dominance come to a peak, the culmination of over a decade of fascination with the Hughes-style teen comedy and the end of a time when violence and nihilism in suburban schools could garner laughs from a broad audience. It\u2019s not impossible to imagine that a similar cultural moment could return. However, it is difficult to envision a future when kids aren\u2019t living with the Damoclean sword of massacre or apocalypse hovering overhead, a future when the adults that brought them into the world and who make movies for them aren\u2019t gripped with guilt and tenderness at the thought of how vulnerable their babies are.\n\nIf that future ever comes, maybe we\u2019ll be able to laugh at teens in peril the way we did in the \u201990s.\n\n\u201cFor the Love of 1999\u201d is a weeklong series offering some totally bangin\u2019 essays and analysis of hot \u2014 or not \u2014 TV, music, movies and celebrities of 1999.
