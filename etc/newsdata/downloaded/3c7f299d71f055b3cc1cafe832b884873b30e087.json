Earlier this month, Sen. Kamala Harris called on Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump for tweets that specifically targeted a whistle-blower, in what Harris claimed was a violation of Twitter\u2019s terms of service. Twitter did not suspend Trump\u2014nor will it take action against other world leaders, according to a new company blog post. Instead, if Twitter decides a politician\u2019s tweet broke the rules, it will leave it on the site, accompanied by a disclaimer.\n\n\u201cIf a Tweet from a world leader does violate the Twitter Rules but there is a clear public interest value to keeping the Tweet on the service, we may place it behind a notice that provides context about the violation and allows people to click through should they wish to see the content,\u201d Twitter\u2019s announcement reads.\n\nTwitter first hinted at the new policy in June, but did not unveil the plan\u2019s specifics. The site will still bar leaders from promoting terrorism, making \u201cclear and direct threats of violence against an individual,\u201d posting a person\u2019s private information, revenge porn, encouraging self-harm, or engaging in child sexual exploitation (which is illegal).\n\nTwitter also announced a new policy for interacting with politicians\u2019 tweets that break the site rules.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t used this notice yet, but when we do, you will not be able to like, reply, share, or Retweet the Tweet in question,\u201d the company tweeted.\n\nCuriously, users will be able to quote-tweet the offending messages.\n\n\u201cYou will still be able to express your opinion with Retweet with Comment,\u201d Twitter continued.\n\nNot every politician will qualify for the policy, but it will not be limited to world leaders. In June, Twitter said that the rule would apply to verified accounts with more than 100,000 followers who \u201crepresent a government/elected official, [are] running for public office, or [are] considered for a government position (i.e., next in line, awaiting confirmation, named successor to an appointed position).\u201d\n\nFor context, presidential candidate John Delaney would not qualify for the policy because he only has about 36,700 Twitter followers. Rep. Steve King, who has used his Twitter to share racist talking points and endorse a white supremacist Canadian political candidate, would be safe because he has more than 100,000 followers. (The now-former candidate, Faith Goldy, would have been protected during her candidacy since she is verified with more than 100,000 followers. She is banned from Facebook.)\n\nTwitter\u2019s announcement comes as Facebook faces criticism for its own policy, which allows politicians to share posts that would normally break the site\u2019s rules against things like hate speech. The company also clarified that it would not fact-check claims politicians make in Facebook ads. YouTube made a similar announcement late last month, stating that politicians\u2019 content was newsworthy, even if it broke site rules. Facebook\u2019s permissiveness of lies in political ads drew national attention this week, after Sen. Elizabeth Warren launched her own pointed Facebook ad highlighting the policy.\n\nThe ad initially claimed, falsely, that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had endorsed Trump. Warren\u2019s campaign soon added context, clarifying that \u201cwhat Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform\u2014and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\u201d", "description": "Some tweets that violate Twitter\u2019s normal rules will stay on the site, according to the company's newly articulated policy.", "authors": ["Kelly Weill"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571175659/GettyImages-187232512_1_sxd6j0", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
