Normally, you might want to wait until Black Friday, but several retailers are discounting the Xbox One S All-Digital Edition model by 20% ($50 off). The console now costs $200.\n\nThe All-Digital is the version of the Xbox One S that doesn't have an optical disc slot. This means that games are downloaded onto the console instead of them being played off discs. It's a great option for those who don't want to deal with physical media. If you prefer physical games (think of Gamestop's pre-owned section) or you would like to it to play Blu-rays and DVDs, this may not be the option for you. As an Xbox One S, it's also not as advanced as the Xbox One X, which supports 4K (the Xbox One S supports 4K with upscaling), among other things. Then again, most people can't tell the difference in image quality and can save themselves the $200 difference in price.\n\nWalmart is also discounting some Xbox One S bundles (the disc version) with select games, like \"NBA 2K19\" and \"Playerunknown's Battlegrounds.\" Discounts vary, but as of this posting, the NBA 2K19 bundle is just $201, making it an even better deal than the All-Digital option.\n\nGet the Xbox One S All-Digital for $199 (originally $249) [You save $50] at Walmart | Amazon | Best Buy | Target", "description": "The Xbox One S is one of the most popular gaming consoles you can buy.
