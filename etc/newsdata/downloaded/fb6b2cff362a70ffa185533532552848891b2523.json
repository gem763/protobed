He also said during the meeting that firing FBI Director James B. Comey the previous day had relieved \u201cgreat pressure\u201d on him.\n\nA memorandum summarizing the meeting was limited to all but a few officials with the highest security clearances in an attempt to keep the president\u2019s comments from being disclosed publicly, according to the former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe White House\u2019s classification of records about Trump\u2019s communications with foreign officials is now a central part of the impeachment inquiry launched this week by House Democrats. An intelligence community whistleblower has alleged that the White House placed a record of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president, in which he offered U.S. assistance investigating his political opponents, into a code-word classified system reserved for the most sensitive intelligence information.\n\nThe White House did not provide a comment Friday.\n\nIt is not clear whether a memo documenting the May 10, 2017, meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak was placed into that system, but the three former officials said it was restricted to a very small number of people. The White House had recently begun limiting the records of Trump\u2019s calls after remarks he made to the leaders of Mexico and Australia appeared in news reports. The Lavrov memo was restricted to an even smaller group, the former officials said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA fourth former official, who did not recall the president\u2019s remarks to the Russian officials, said memos were restricted only to people who needed to know their contents.\n\n\u201cIt was more about learning how can we restrict this in a way that still informs the policy process and the principals who need to engage with these heads of state,\u201d the fourth former official said.\n\nBut the three former officials with knowledge of the remarks said some memos of the president\u2019s communications were kept from people who might ordinarily have access to them. The Lavrov memo fit that description, they said.\n\nWhite House officials were particularly distressed by Trump\u2019s election remarks because it appeared the president was forgiving Russia for an attack that had been designed to help elect him, the three former officials said. Trump also seemed to invite Russia to interfere in other countries\u2019 elections, they said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe previous day, Trump had fired Comey amid the FBI\u2019s investigation into whether the Trump campaign had coordinated with Russia. White House aides worried about the political ramifications if Trump\u2019s comments to the Russian officials became public.\n\nTrump had publicly ridiculed the Russia investigation as politically motivated and said he doubted Moscow had intervened in the election. By the time he met with Lavrov and Kislyak, Trump had been briefed by the most senior U.S. intelligence officials about the Russian operation, which was directed by Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin and included the theft and publication of Democratic emails and the seeded of propaganda in social-media, according to the findings of the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nTrump\u2019s firing of Comey touched off an investigation into whether the president had tried to obstruct the FBI\u2019s probe. His comments about Comey\u2019s dismissal being a relief, which were first reported the same month by the New York Times, reinforced suspicions that Trump dismissed Comey because the FBI was investigating him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the fourth former official, Trump lamented to Lavrov that \u201call this Russia stuff\u201d was detrimental to good relations. Trump also complained, \u201cI could have a great relationship with you guys, but you know, our press,\u201d this former official said, characterizing the president\u2019s remarks.\n\nH.R. McMaster, the president\u2019s then-national security adviser, repeatedly told Trump he could not trust the Russians, according to two former officials.\n\nOn some areas, Trump conveyed U.S. policy in a constructive way, such as telling the Russians that their aggression in Ukraine was not good, one of those former officials said.\n\n\u201cWhat was difficult to understand was how they got a free pass on a lot of things \u2014 election security and so forth,\u201d this former official said. \u201cHe was just very accommodating to them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe former official observed that Trump has \u201cthat streak of moral equivalency,\u201d recalling how he once dismissed a question about the assassination of journalists and dissidents in Putin\u2019s Russia by telling Fox News\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly, \u201cThere are a lot of killers. You think our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d\n\nAnother former official said Trump wasn\u2019t the only one to conflate Russia\u2019s interference in the U.S. elections with U.S. efforts to promote democracy and good governance abroad.\n\nThe president and his top aides seemed not to understand the difference between Voice of America, a U.S.-supported news organization that airs in foreign countries, with Russian efforts to persuade American voters by surreptitiously planting ads in social media, this person said.\n\nOne former senior official said Trump regularly defended Russia\u2019s actions, even in private, saying no country is pure. \u201cHe was always defensive of Russia,\u201d this person said, adding the president had never made such a specific remark about interference in their presence.\n\n\u201cHe thought the whole interference thing was ridiculous. He never bought into it.\u201d\n\nGreg Miller contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "A memo summarizing an Oval Office meeting with two senior Russian officials was limited to all but a few officials.
