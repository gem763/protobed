And that notoriety has spilled outside of the restroom's marble walls, turning the urinal into a bona fide historical attraction.\n\n\"It's the abominable snowman of toilets,\" said Graeme Menzies, who featured the urinal in his 2019 book 111 Places in Vancouver That You Must Not Miss.\n\nThe urinal has lurked in the basement bathroom since 1916, when the building originally opened as a post office.\n\nThe building on Main and 15th once housed the federal agriculture department and the RCMP. (Ben Nelms/CBC)\n\nYou can thank John Shanks for its cozy construction. The Scottish plumber patented more than a hundred urinal designs in the 19th century, when safe sewage disposal was essential amid cholera and typhus outbreaks, Menzies said.\n\nOne of Shanks' \"twin twinklers,\" as Menzies calls it, ended up in Heritage Hall. In a biography of the building, an architect speculated the urinal may have been an industrial fitting during the building's early post office days.\n\nIt's the abominable snowman of toilets. - Graeme Menzies, co-author of 111 Places in Vancouver That You Must Not Miss\n\nBut it's not clear why Shanks shunned privacy in this particular design, Menzies said. In fact, the Scotsman only made it worse by angling both sides of the urinal toward each other.\n\n\"It's kind of startling to look at,\" Menzies said. \"You wonder if it's Photoshopped or if it's a joke. And then no, it gets real.\"\n\nThe urinal stubbornly survived as the building switched hands over the decades, housing the federal agriculture department from 1965 to 1976, and later the RCMP (proving useful for the male-dominated force, Menzies noted).\n\nThe building was then abandoned and fell into disrepair, before undergoing a massive restoration in the early 1980s. In the building's biography, project architect Susan Baker recalled her delight at discovering the twin urinal.\n\n\"There's nothing like that in the women's washroom,\" she mused.\n\nThe urinal is highlighted in a biography about Heritage Hall. (Ben Nelms/CBC)\n\nToday, the building houses non-profit offices and is mainly used as an event space. The urinal remains one of its few original features.\n\nJan Tollefsen, the building manager for Heritage Hall, said she's barely had to maintain it in her three years working at the site.\n\n\"It was made to last,\" she said.\n\nWhile the urinal flushes on its own every 20 minutes, there is, ahem, a smell of pee that lingers. Not even a urinal deodorizer can thwart it, Tollefsen said. Still, nothing stops visitors from revelling in the contraption.\n\n\"I've even had people do photo shoots down around it,\" Tollefsen said.\n\nBut gentlemen, if you're thinking of checking out this one-of-a-kind john, don't unzip just yet.\n\nIt's only open for private events, meaning you'll either have to host a wedding \u2014 or be invited to one \u2014 to take part in what has become a strange Vancouver tradition.\n\n\"Everyone's fascinated by it because it's so bizarre,\" Tollefsen said.", "description": "For more than a century, unsuspecting men have been blindsided by its design.", "authors": ["Alex Migdal Is A Reporter", "Social Media Editor For Cbc News In Vancouver.
