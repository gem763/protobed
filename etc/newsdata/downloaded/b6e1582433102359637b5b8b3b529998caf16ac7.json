(AP) - Crews are laying tons of gravel in the American River near Sacramento to re-establish a crucial spawning area for native salmon and steelhead trout.\n\nThe Sacramento Bee reported Saturday that the project started this month will allow female salmon to use the loose stones to build redds, a kind of nest, to deposit their eggs.\n\nOfficials say because of dams upriver, sediment and debris that would otherwise settle along the river are blocked, making the area less hospitable to fish.\n\nAlso part of the project is a new side channel that will create a protected stretch for juvenile fish to grow. The shallow, slower moving water will allow insects and vegetation to flourish for feeding.\n\nSimilar restoration projects are planned for the American River over the next 15 years.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Sacramento Bee, http://www.sacbee.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Crews are laying tons of gravel in the American River near Sacramento to re-establish a crucial spawning area for native salmon and steelhead trout.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
