And his head-to-head numbers against President Donald Trump are stronger than anyone else\u2019s.\n\nNo one should be surprised next year if Joe Biden becomes the nominee.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhat is surprising is how many people expect his campaign to implode any day.\n\nIt is a sensation underpinning the entire primary, evident not only in the vulturous calculations of Biden\u2019s competitors, but also within his own orbit of supporters \u2014 a feeling that the frontrunner may be made of porcelain, one direct hit short of falling apart.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a clear worry among Biden supporters that he can\u2019t be the front-runner from June of 2019 through July of 2020 \u2026 that eventually the gaffes will pile up and he\u2019ll come down,\u201d said Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and one of Biden\u2019s most vocal supporters.\n\nMany of Biden\u2019s supporters, said Rendell, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, are \u201cnervous as hell.\u201d\n\nIn part, the anxiety surrounding Biden\u2019s candidacy is rooted in the last presidential campaign. After Hillary Clinton was upset by Trump, many Democrats adopted a more sober view of what it means to be a front-runner.\n\nAnd unlike in the 2016 primary \u2014 a two-person race between Clinton and Bernie Sanders \u2014 the primary this year is stacked with credible alternatives. William Owen, a DNC member from Tennessee who has endorsed Biden, said that although he expects Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, two more progressive Democrats in the race, to continue to split the support among the party\u2019s left flank, \u201cIf one of them starts surging, we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d\n\nOwen said he pressed Biden\u2019s advisers at the DNC\u2019s summer meeting in San Francisco last month to develop plans for a second-ballot strategy at the party\u2019s national convention next year, saying \u201cit\u2019s highly possible that \u2026 we get to the convention and no one has a majority.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little worried,\u201d Owen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a healthy concern, just like every candidate should be concerned about where they are in the primary process.\u201d\n\nDoubts about Biden\u2019s durability were widely held even before he announced his campaign: There was his long and moderate record in the Senate, newly vulnerable in a Democratic Party that has shifted left, his history of weak fundraising, his failure in past presidential campaigns and, at 76, his advanced age.\n\nAt almost every juncture so far, Biden has proved the skeptics wrong. He\u2019s kept pace in the money race, although he lags significantly behind Warren and Sanders in online fundraising. And public support he held before announcing his candidacy \u2014 once viewed by mainly as affinity for a former statesman and broad name recognition, not an electoral preference \u2014 hasn\u2019t faded.\n\nHe\u2019s averaging 31 percent in national polling, according to Real Clear Politics, and he\u2019s 12 percentage points ahead of his nearest competitor, Sanders, in the latest Morning Consult survey.\n\nBut five months before the Iowa caucuses \u2014 and with many Democrats still uncommitted \u2014 even that lead appears unconvincing to many.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deceptive lead, because it really doesn\u2019t get tested until we get down to a narrower race in which, at some stage, people are going to have to say, \u2018Is he our guy or not,\u2019\u201d said Paul Maslin, a top Democratic pollster who worked on the presidential campaigns of Jimmy Carter and Howard Dean.\n\nOr, as Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, put it, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how strong a front-runner Biden is [because] people are sort of waiting and seeing.\u201d\n\nPatrick Riley, a lawyer and Democratic activist in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who has endorsed Biden, said that there are \u201cjust so many candidates around this time\u201d and that one of his concerns about Biden is that \u201cjust because he\u2019s winning, he hasn\u2019t obtained over 50 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he will be the candidate, probably,\u201d Riley said. \u201cBut these things are never for certain. And I think it\u2019s fair to say Hillary [in the 2016 primary] was more of a certainty.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s rivals, many of whom have long expected the former vice president to fade, began making comparisons to another Clinton campaign \u2014 her failed run in 2008 \u2014 last week, after a Biden adviser told reporters that that while Iowa is \u201ccritical\u201d and the campaign expects to carry the state, it is not a must-win.\n\nClinton collapsed in South Carolina, a stronghold for Biden, after then-Sen. Barack Obama\u2019s upset victory in Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the corpse is already rotting,\u201d an adviser to one of Biden\u2019s competitors said.\n\nBiden\u2019s appeal to Democrats is so tightly tied to his perceived ability to defeat Trump that if he appears likely to suffer an early loss, one veteran Democratic strategist in Iowa said, \u201cif you take any drop in [polling] support, you might bleed.\u201d\n\nIt is that belief that \u2014 except for the progressive threat posed by Sanders and Warren \u2014 now accounts for any competitiveness in the 2020 campaign.\n\nMany moderates entered the race on a singular bet that \u201cBiden can\u2019t survive,\u201d said a top Democratic strategist who advised several presidential contenders before they announced their candidacies. With the exception of the two top-polling progressives, nearly every candidate has some variation of \u201cwhen Biden fails\u201d written into their campaign plans, premising much of their appeal as a palatable alternative.\n\n\"Is Joe Biden an ice cube that will melt this fall, or is Joe Biden an iceberg that will carry him all the way to November?\u201d said Dan Sena, who led the Democrats' House takeover in 2018 and is now advising Sen. Michael Bennet in his presidential campaign. \u201cUntil that vote frees up, it's hard for anyone else to move.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden listens to a question from a member of the audience during a campaign stop on Friday in Laconia, N.H. | Mary Schwartz/AP Photo\n\nPete Kavanaugh, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager and point person in the early nominating states, said last week that the campaign was not trying to lower expectations in Iowa but that, with any number of paths to the nomination, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t think any single state is an absolute must-win.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh said he expects the contours of the race to remain undefined until late this year. However, he said of Biden, \u201cHe\u2019s been the frontrunner for 18 months,\u201d noting that Biden has sustained \u201call manner of attacks thrown at us for the last five, and literally nothing has changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolling-wise, nothing has changed,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cWe\u2019re effectively where we were.\u201d\n\nSo far, efforts to wound Biden have failed to dislodge him from the top spot. Sen. Cory Booker is still languishing in single-digits, despite his aggressive criticism of Biden\u2019s record on criminal justice. Sen. Kamala Harris gained momentum in national polling, then receded, after lighting into Biden during a debate for his positions on federal school busing and former associations with segregationist senators.\n\nAnd lesser candidates were stymied by Biden from the start.\n\nAfter John Hickenlooper launched his presidential bid in early March, he hit his fundraising goals both in March and April. But by the end of April, when Biden entered the race, the former Colorado governor\u2019s fundraising immediately plummeted \u2014 watching his per-day contributions drop by two-thirds, according to a former Hickenlooper staffer.\n\n\"Looking back, every day before Biden announced was worth its weight in gold,\" the staffer said about the financial loss when Biden entered the race. \"Money dried up, moderate or center-left voters had their candidate and there just wasn't oxygen for anyone else.\"\n\nAnd again, in June, Hickenlooper's campaign conducted several focus groups in Iowa after Hickenlooper made waves with a California speech warning Democrats against flirting with socialism. Iowa voters, surveyed by the Hickenlooper campaign, \"really, really liked\" what the governor had to say, but they wouldn't budge from Biden.\n\n\"It just wasn't enough to peel them away,\" the staffer said. \"It was difficult, if not impossible, to take voters away from him. He's going to have to lose them.\"\n\nFormer Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, who briefly ran for president in 2008, said Biden\u2019s opponents may be underestimating Biden\u2019s resilience, adapting an idiom for the primary when he said, \u201cI would say to those people who are waiting for Uncle Joe to leave the scene, \u2018He who waits for dead men\u2019s shoes waits in vain,\u2019 because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going anywhere.\u201d\n\nAnd Rendell said uncertainty surrounding Biden is attributable to \u201ca little bit of wishful thinking by his opponents.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not as weak as his opponents think he is. He\u2019s not as weak as his supporters think he is,\u201d Rendell said.\n\nHe acknowledged it is \u201cvery hard to go wire to wire, particularly with a candidate who is prone to make occasional mistakes.\u201d But he added that Biden has \u201cstaying power,\u201d and he said, \u201cI\u2019m a little less nervous than most.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Most rivals have some variation of \u201cwhen Biden fails\u201c written into their campaign plans.", "authors": ["David Siders", "Elena Schneider"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/78/8c/1de9eea8497ba5e5743206352c42/190908-joe-biden-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
