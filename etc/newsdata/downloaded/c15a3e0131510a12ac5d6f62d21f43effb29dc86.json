US authorities said that some victims had follow-up calls with the scammers, who claimed that the original tech support company had gone out of business.\n\nScammers would offer to refund the victim, but in a later phone call, would claim that they've sent too much money because of a typo (i.e. sending $4,500 instead of $450). They'd then ask victims to send back the difference in gift cards.\n\nScammers preyed on the elderly\n\nOf the 7,500 victims who fell for these scams, US authorities said the vast majority were elderly. In 2015, Microsoft said that of the 175,000 customer complaints it receives about tech support scams, the vast majority came from the elderly, many of whom don't have the technical acumen to recognize the scams.\n\n\"As alleged, these defendants participated in a sophisticated fraud scheme that preyed on the elderly,\" said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman. \"This fraud scheme deceived thousands of victims, including some of society's most vulnerable members.\"\n\nIn an indictment unsealed on Wednesday, the US Department of Justice said the two suspects played a pivotal role in the scheme, which operated from March 2015 through December 2018.\n\nLeyva and Haque set up the companies that received the proceeds of these fraudulent payments, and also recruited other members part of the conspiracy and instructed them to do the same.\n\nLeyva was arrested in Las Vegas and Haque in New York. Both were charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\nIn 2018, tech support schemes generated over 142,000 consumer complaints with the US Federal Trade Commission.", "description": "Suspects run tech support scam sites and made over $10m from over 7,500 victims by billing unneeded tech support fees.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/30/372073c8-a2f6-4173-818c-8ed4c0355709/thumbnail/770x578/47e6b72a5f7ea2467473e6a51bd04459/handcuffs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
