His life and leadership were a tribute to the Catholic values with which we were raised: faith, family, patriotism,\" Pelosi said. \"He profoundly believed, as did our parents, that public service was a noble calling and that we all had a responsibility to help others.\"\n\nD\u2019Alesandro served as mayor from 1967 to 1971 during a time of upheaval that included riots in 1968. After his term he did not seek re-election and went into private law practice.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., left, laughs as her brother Thomas D' Alesandro III, right, makes a joke as he introduces her husband Paul, during a street renaming ceremony in her behalf, in Baltimore, Jan. 5, 2007.

A champion of civil rights, he worked tirelessly for all who called Baltimore home,\" Pelosi said. \"All his life, Tommy worked on the side of the angels. Now, he is with them.\"\n\nTheir father, Thomas D\u2019Alesandro Jr., also served as Baltimore's mayor as well in the Maryland House of Delegates and as a U.S. congressman from 1947 to 1959.\n\nPelosi said he is survived by his wife Margaret, their children Thomas, Dominic, Nicholas, Patricia and Gregory, and their grandchildren.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/20/nancy-pelosis-brother-thomas-dalesandro-dies/4047064002/", "description": "\"Tommy was the finest public servant I have ever known,\" Pelosi said. \"All his life, Tommy worked on the side of the angels.
