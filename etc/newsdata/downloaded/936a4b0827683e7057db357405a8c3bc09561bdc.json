I always have to say that they are allegations.\n\n\"It doesn't mean there's no truth in it or you can in any way ignore it.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"But we're not at that point where we know what happened.\"\n\nJackson's estate have denied the claims against the singer, who died in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile Peter's ex wife Katie Price has been rocked by claims from her ex lover Charles Drury, 22.\n\nCharles claims that on the first night they met they binged on drugs and drink before sleeping together hours later.\n\n(Image: charlesdrury1/Instagram)\n\n(Image: Brett D. Cove / Splash News)\n\nWhen he woke up the next morning she hadn't been to sleep and had trashed their hotel room, he said.\n\nHe said Katie is \"all over the place\" and sometimes disappears for days at a time.\n\nWithin two weeks Charles was living in her mucky mansion after she dumped Kris Boyson for him.\n\nThey would sleep in the annex because her house is currently \"unlivable\".\n\nHe believes she cheated on him during their fling, but she would never admit to it.\n\nHowever, Katie's rep said: \"There is no truth in the allegation that she is taking drugs every day and has made significant steps to being drug free - there have been lapses in the past but they are just that, not a regular event. Katie is still in recovery and making progress.\"", "description": "Peter Andre has landed a lead role in the Michael Jackson musical Thriller - after coming to the defence of his singer idol", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Instagram", "Getty Images", "Brett D.
