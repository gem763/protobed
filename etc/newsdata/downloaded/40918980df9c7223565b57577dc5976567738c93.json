From our point of view, no.\u201d\n\nThe impasse sets up a showdown between Macron and the rest of the bloc at a two-day summit in Brussels from Thursday if Europe ministers cannot agree to open talks in Luxembourg.\n\nDEEPLY FRUSTRATED\n\nWhile the Netherlands supports French wariness of membership talks for Albania, which is already a member of the U.S.-led NATO alliance, many other countries, led by Italy, are deeply frustrated by the French position.\n\nParis says the EU faces too many challenges to let in two more states from the Balkans, a region still scarred by wars fought in the 1990s and struggling with crime and corruption.\n\nGermany has proposed a compromise by starting EU membership talks with North Macedonia before the end of this year and agreeing in principle to launch the process for Albania, but without setting a date before Tirana meets more conditions.\n\nThe European Commission, which handles so-called EU accession talks, said it was wrong to add more conditions because North Macedonia and Albania had met targets set by the EU governments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming harder and harder to provide a proper explanation (for the delay),\u201d European Commissioner Johannes Hahn, who oversees EU membership bids, told Reuters. \u201cIf we agreed with our partners on steps to take and our partners are delivering, it is then our time to deliver.\u201d\n\nHahn pointed to Albanian reforms to root out bribery among judges, which many in the EU say are the most significant assault on judicial graft since the state of three million people emerged from communist isolation in the early 1990s.\n\nNorth Macedonia, meanwhile, has resolved a long dispute with Greece over the country\u2019s name - changing from Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to Republic of North Macedonia - and has cleared the way for NATO membership, probably in December.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to give a political signal that enlargement is not dead,\u201d said George Ciamba, Romania\u2019s EU minister, as he arrived at the Luxembourg meeting.", "description": "France stuck to its hardline position against European Union membership talks for North Macedonia and Albania on Tuesday, warning it could not approve negotiations until the bloc reformed the \"endless soap opera\" of admitting new members.", "authors": ["Robin Emmott", "Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
