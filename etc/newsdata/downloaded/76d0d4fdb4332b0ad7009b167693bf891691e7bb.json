In fact, many silent majority in Greater China view these teeny-boppers as monstrous vandals.\n\nCommunist China has been attempting to portray the Hong Kong uprising as an American plot to destabilize China, so the Clinton phrase was probably borrowed intentionally.\n\nHaving failed to frighten Hong Kong into line by threatening to develop the nearby Chinese city of Shenzhen into its replacement, the Chinese Communist Party used the Global Times to warn that Macau might just become the new Hong Kong if the original continues to misbehave:\n\nOverall, in these days when Hong Kong is becoming sick, Macao is becoming a beacon of great health with good medicine, from the first medical school to embracing its brothers and sisters with medicine and education across Guangdong, to its Portuguese-speaking cousins across the world. When Macao celebrates the 20th anniversary of the handover in December, it will be clear to many that Macao has a new role in this region \u2013 and will for sure be aiming for new heights of history.\n\nMacau is actually in a bit of a slump right now. China\u2019s National Day holiday, commemorating the founding of the People\u2019s Republic, kicks off the annual \u201cGolden Week\u201d in Macau, essentially a big publicity stunt to attract tourism. Golden Week 2019 is currently running far below projections, in part due to the general economic slowdown in China.\n\nThis could be exacerbated by the unrest in Hong Kong disrupting tourism across the area, although bullish Macau analysts expected Hong Kong\u2019s woes to boost their tourism as travelers sought alternative destinations.", "description": "Chinese state media borrows Hillary Clinton's infamous phrase to describe the Hong Kong protest movement as a \"basket of deplorables.\"", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1172095189-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
