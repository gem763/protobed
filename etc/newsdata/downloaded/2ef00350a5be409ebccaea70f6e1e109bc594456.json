Mr Trump himself argued that the official was guilty of \u201ctreason\u201d and posed a national security risk, and he suggested that his then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions should use law enforcement to investigate the official.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Such software has been used to solve literary mysteries and unmask authors writing under pseudonyms, including JK Rowling, who published mystery novels as Robert Galbraith.\n\nThere\u2019s a long American tradition of anonymously published political writing, including \u201cCommon Sense,\u201d which Thomas Paine originally released anonymously in the 1770s at the beginning of the American Revolution, and the Federalist Papers, which were published under a collective pen name. But previous attempts at writing anonymous political books have fallen apart quickly: Just a few months after the publication of \u201cPrimary Colours,\u201d a thinly veiled 1996 novel about Bill Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign, journalist Joe Klein was outed as its author.\n\nSean Desmond, the publisher of Twelve, said that there were good reasons for the author to remain unnamed.\n\n\u201cAnonymous explains in the book why they won\u2019t reveal themselves as the author \u2014 and I found those arguments persuasive,\u201d Mr Desmond said. \u201cAnd part of the reason for the anonymity, I think, is to present the story of this administration without filter, without fear of reprisal from the president, and to tell the truth about what\u2019s going on in this White House.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "An anonymous Trump administration official who published a September 2018 essay in The New York Times, about the active resistance to the president\u2019s agenda and behaviour from within his own administration, will publish a book next month.", "authors": ["Alexandra Alter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/22/15/Donald-Trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
