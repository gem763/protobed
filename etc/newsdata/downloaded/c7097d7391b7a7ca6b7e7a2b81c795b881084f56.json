REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo\n\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Air China Ltd (601111.SS) has no plans to take over Hong Kong\u2019s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (0293.HK), an independent director of the state-owned Chinese carrier told the South China Morning Post newspaper.\n\n\u201cBased on what I know, I wouldn\u2019t think that is anywhere on the agenda, no way,\u201d Air China non-executive director Stanley Hui told the newspaper when asked if the carrier, a 30% shareholder, might seek to buy Cathay outright.\n\nThe Hong Kong airline has become the biggest corporate casualty of anti-government protests after China demanded it suspend staff involved in, or who support, demonstrations that have plunged the former British colony into a political crisis.\n\nCathay Chairman John Slosar last week announced plans to step down in November, less than three weeks after CEO Rupert Hogg left amid mounting regulatory scrutiny.\n\nAir China is Cathay\u2019s second-largest shareholder, behind manager Swire Pacific Ltd (0019.HK) with a 45% stake. Long-time Swire executive Patrick Healy was last week appointed as Slosar\u2019s replacement.\n\nSome analysts have said it would be logical for Air China to take over the remainder of Cathay in the future.\n\nHowever, Hui told the South China Morning Post that any Beijing-led moves that changed Cathay Pacific\u2019s ownership would send a wrong signal to foreign investors.\n\nAir China could not be reached immediately for comment.", "description": "Air China Ltd <601111.SS> has no plans to take over Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <0293.HK>, an independent director of the state-owned Chinese carrier told the South China Morning Post newspaper.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427784570&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8803N", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
