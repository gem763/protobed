Common ingredients lurking in your make-up", "language": "en", "text": "From sulfates and triclosan to phthalates and artificial fragrances, the dirty words of beauty can be a real minefield to get your head around. And the long list of letters and numbers on the back of our favourite products can be anxiety inducing even for the most seasoned of beauty gurus.\n\nKeira Rumble, a certified nutrition and wellness advisor who has launched her own range of beauty food supplements and has a massive 440,000 social following says, 'With the beauty industry being extremely under-regulated, it makes sense to try and eliminate where possible the unnecessary toxin and chemical exposure to your body'.\n\nCertified Nutrition and Wellness Advisor, Keira Ruble, is a huge fan of natural beauty, making the switch to chemical free products two years ago\n\nSo luckily Nude by Nature, a clean beauty brand has released a new natural lipstick. With ingredients like almond oil, shea butter, vitamin E and kakadu plum and steering clear of any silicones and synthetics, our lips gave it the lick of approval.\n\nWith a moisture enriched and non-drying formula, the highly-pigmented Satin Liquid Lipstick will make your lips feel nourished, and give you confidence knowing the colour will last for hours without any nasty chemicals or synthetic ingredients.\n\nWith many women already jumping onboard the clean beauty movement opting for natural ingredients, you might feel inspired do a Marie Kondo-style purge of your own beauty cabinet as we take look at the common nasty ingredients lurking in your makeup.\n\nAvailable in 10 highly-pigmented shades, the moisture enriched Satin Liquid Lipstick flatters every complexion\n\nSYNTHETICS\n\nNot all synthetics are created equal.\n\nWhilst some are more harmful than others, certain types of synthetics have been found to be toxic with accumulation in the body over time linked to skin irritation.\n\nIt was the toxic ingredients in beauty products that first lead to Rumble making changes in her own life to avoid them.\n\n'I made the transition to natural makeup products just over two years ago. I think the turning point for me was sitting in my doctor's office and being told that I had heavy metal toxicity, with some seriously high readings on my results,' she says.\n\n'I needed and wanted to know more about the steps I could implement in my own life to make sure that I wasn't exposing myself to any unnecessary chemicals or toxins'.\n\nPARABENS\n\nThese synthetically produced chemicals are commonly used in cosmetics to extend the life of the products, as well as preventing the growth of bad bacteria and mould.\n\nHowever, Rumble says: 'The biggest concern with parabens, is that [they] have been linked to possible hormone disruption, [and] not only that, but for someone who has quite sensitive skin like myself, they can cause skin irritation.'\n\nParabens are found not only in makeup, but also in toothpastes, deodorants, shampoos and body lotions, so even if you don't use products with parabens on your face, there could still be an accumulation in your body.\n\nFree of all parabens, the Satin Liquid Lipstick is dermatologist tested and suitable for people with sensitive skin\n\nSILICONE\n\nSilicones are a synthetically produced ingredient that are commonly used as a skin smoother to give cosmetics a silky texture. They make the product spreadable and fill fine lines which can make you think it's 'working', even though the effect is only surface deep.\n\nThe bad news? Silicone can also trap all the nasty things under your skin like bacteria and impurities, possibly leading to increased breakouts.\n\nNot only that, silicones can sometimes make your skin look dry and dull, preventing moisture from getting in and throwing your skins natural regeneration process off balance.\n\nMoisture enriched and non-drying, the new Nude by Nature lipstick formula will give you full coverage and lasting wear, without any nasty synthetics\n\nCARMINE\n\nThis red pigment is derived from beetles that live as parasites on cactus plants. It's considered controversial due to it's animal origin, however, carmine has also been linked to severe allergic reactions in the skin.\n\nSneakily, carmine can be labelled under 'natural colouring' which can make it difficult for people who do suffer with allergies to identify whether the ingredient is in a product.\n\nCarmine free, the Satin Liquid Lipstick is free of all allergens, making it a safe choice for people with sensitive skin or are prone to allergies\n\nThe most common lip colours to contain carmine are reds, pinks and purples - but not in Nude by Nature's lip collection, including the new Satin Liquid range, which is completely free of the hidden ingredient.\n\nFYI: the colour ingredients in a product usually come right at the end of the list.\n\nPETROLEUM WAXES\n\nPetroleum waxes are obtained during the processing of crude oil. They have no nutrient value for the skin and can even interfere with the body's own natural moisturising mechanisms, so it's particularly important to avoid them if you suffer from dry lips.\n\nThis makes the Satin Liquid Lipstick the perfect choice with it's highly pigmented, moisture enriched, non-drying formula full of shea butter and almond oil.\n\nPetroleum wax free: The formula used to create the Satin Liquid Lipstick won't dry out your lips of interfere with your body's natural moisture levels\n\nAlthough the list of no-go ingredients can be a little daunting, Rumble's biggest piece of advice is: 'Trust your gut and if you read something somewhere, don't instantly believe it! Do your own research and if it sounds too good to be true, it most likely is.'\n\nSo how do you know you're not being tricked?\n\n'I think above everything, it is really important to be a savvy shopper when it comes to your makeup. There are a lot of brands out there that say that they are \"all natural\", when in reality they actually aren't.'", "description": "SPONSORED", "authors": ["Alice Piper For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/06/19724842-0-image-a-15_1571117373169.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
