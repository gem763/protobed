Now the government has published a version of the document headed \u201cReasonable Worst Case Planning Assumptions\u201d, so he appeared to be guilty merely of exaggeration.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Rosamund Urwin, the Sunday Times journalist who got the scoop, said the version she saw was headed: \u201cPlanning Assumptions\u201d then \u201cBase scenario\u201d. In other words, not the worst possible outcomes but just the expected ones.\n\nGove disagreed with her on Twitter, saying she was \u201cpersisting in an error\u201d and referring to his evidence to the Brexit select committee. Unfortunately for him, Urwin replied with extracts from the committee minutes in which Gove admitted that the phrase \u201cbase scenario\u201d appeared in the document.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

He ought instead to focus on the third line of his defence, which is that he, as no-deal planning minister, has \u201ctaken more steps to mitigate\u201d the effect of leaving without a deal.\n\nIf he really wanted to persuade a sceptical nation, he should set out the measures the government has taken to minimise the damaging effects of no-deal disruption. He should say that the whole point of the Yellowhammer exercise was to identify the problems and to deal with them.\n\nThe most effective line he could take, however, would be to say that parliament has already passed an act to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He could say we do not need to worry about a no-deal exit because it is not going to happen.\n\nIt might not be entirely convincing, because the EU could still refuse another Brexit extension, even if the prime minister is required by law to seek it. But that is still unlikely. The most plausible route to a no-deal Brexit is through a general election which Boris Johnson wins \u2013 which is why Labour MPs wouldn\u2019t vote for it on Monday, and probably will never vote for it while the Tories are ahead in the opinion polls.\n\nInstead of wasting his energy and credibility on unconvincing spin, Gove could say that the opposition\u2019s use of a \u201chumble address\u201d to force the publication of a Yellowhammer document and communications about suspending parliament was a pointless bit of grandstanding.\n\nThe Yellowhammer document has already been published by The Sunday Times and is about a scenario that is now unlikely to happen, while the important fact about prorogation is that, if it was to stop an anti-no-deal law being passed, it didn\u2019t work.\n\nGove could set out the facts. One fact is that the government has been defeated. But you can see why he doesn\u2019t want to say that.", "description": "When the Yellowhammer document assessing the effect of leaving the EU without a deal was leaked to The Sunday Times last month, Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal planning, dismissed it as an \u201cold document\u201d.", "authors": ["John Rentoul"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/02/18/gove-downing-street.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
