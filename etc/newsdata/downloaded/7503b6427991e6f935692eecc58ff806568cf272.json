Buzz60\n\nUnited Airlines is taking the grounded Boeing 737 Max out of its schedule through the holiday travel season, joining American and Southwest as the timing of the plane's return remains uncertain.\n\nThe airline on Friday said the plane, which has been grounded since March 13 following two fatal crashes in five months, will stay out of its schedule through Jan. 5, two weeks later than planned.\n\nUnited, optimistic the plane would be recertified by the FAA this year as Boeing had hoped, had been selling flights scheduled to be operated with a Max for travel beginning Dec. 20. That would put the planes back in service in time for the holiday travel crunch.\n\nUnited has 14 Boeing 737 Max 9s in its fleet and more on order. (Photo: United Airlines)\n\nWit those planes no longer in the schedule, United said it will proactively cancel about 75 flights a day in December and 56 in January, a fraction of United's daily departures.\n\nTravelers who already purchased tickets for that time period will be automatically rebooked and notified if their flights are affected, United said.\n\nPassengers who don't like the alternate flights will be given the option of a refund, even if their tickets are nonrefundable.\n\nAirline change your holiday flight?
