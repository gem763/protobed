And so the only way my interest in the arts thrived was because I had parents who valued those interests,\u201d she said Monday night at the school\u2019s annual Mask Ball in New York City. \u201cAnd my mother in particular, she really nurtured my artistic spirit.\u201d\n\nSo it was only appropriate that the Oscar winner\u2019s mother, Dorothy Nyong\u2019o, also received the Visionary Lineage Award alongside her daughter at The Plaza Hotel.\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t do much,\u201d Dorothy Nyong\u2019o said to laughs from the audience, which included staff and students from the Harlem School of Arts, board members, donors and more.\n\nDorothy Nyong\u2019o said she noticed her daughter\u2019s interest in the arts as a child and so she looked \u201cfor opportunities to nurture that.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy job was really to facilitate it and I\u2019d like to encourage parents to do it. Sometimes we make the mistake of trying to make our children what we think we want,\u201d she said.\n\nDorothy Nyong\u2019o won over the audience with more sweet words for her 36-year-old daughter, who has appeared in films such as \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201dStar Wars,\u201d \u201dUs\u201d and \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d for which she won an Academy Award.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of her. She makes me shine.\u201d\n\nLupita Nyong\u2019o, who earned a Tony nomination for her lead role in Broadway\u2019s \u201cEclipsed,\u201d thanked her mom for all of her support, explaining that when she was a teenager her mother \u201cdrove to rehearsals after a long day at work\u201d and sat \u201cin the car for five or so hours \u2026 and she never complained.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host Trevor Noah introduced the Nyong\u2019os to the stage, and they left the stage as \u201cBrown Skin Girl\u201d - a song celebrating dark-skinned women where Beyonc\u00e9 namedrops Lupita\u2019s name - blasted in the background.\n\nOther honorees at Monday\u2019s benefit - which raised more than $100,000 in text message donations and featured performances from students, alumni and staff - included Essence Communications CEO Michelle Ebanks and JP Morgan Chase executive Racquel Oden.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As Lupita Nyong'o accepted an award from the Harlem School of Arts - and entered the stage to Beyonc\u00e9's anthemic hit \"Brown Skin Girl\" - the actress mainly had two people to thank for fueling her passion for the arts as a child: her parents.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mesfin Fekadu"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/people_lupita_nyongo_06342_c0-186-2073-1395_s1200x700.jpg?b639c144e4bc7b8678d6be366d4a5e7f75981cd9", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
