One, who believed she could never be an actress as she couldn't afford the training, discovered a scholarship through one of her followed accounts, which she went on to be awarded.\n\nThe study, Disrupting the Feed, found that 93 per cent of the girls who took part said their outlook had improved and their horizons had been expanded.\n\nMany of the teenagers said their self esteem had been boosted and others set and achieved higher goals.\n\nThe data is set to be presented to media secretary Nicky Morgan, and will go on to be examined at more than 100 schools over the next few months before being rolled out more widely.\n\nThe study found that by following a diverse range of inspirational role models, such as Serena Williams, the teenagers could 'transform' their mental health\n\nLeila Symonds, 17, from Kingston Upon Thames, said she only followed Instagram models and reality stars before the study.\n\nShe revealed: 'It taught me there are other sides to social media. Instead of hating myself I go to the gym and spend less time on social media.'\n\nDr Apter, whose research the study was based on, suggested that while social media is embedded in the lives of teenagers, it could be reshaped to show the girls a more 'diverse' landscape.\n\nShe called it a 'no brainer' and suggested it be bought out into the education system 'fully'.", "description": "A study at Cambridge university saw teenagers ditch negative influencers from social media in place of inspirational role models leading to a dramatic improvement in mental health.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/09/19355812-0-image-a-5_1570350065937.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
