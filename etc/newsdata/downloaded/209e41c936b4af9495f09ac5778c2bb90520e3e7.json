The comedian then went off on a tangent on what else he thinks was going through Trump's mind.\n\n\"Look, Volody, all I'm saying is I scratch your back, you help me bury Joe Biden's political career in a shallow grave, in the woods, down by the dump,\" Colbert said while impersonating Trump.\n\nTONIGHT: If you thought Trump was smart enough to not voluntarily release evidence of his crimes, then you thought wrong. #LSSC pic.twitter.com/Nplvsoza0t \u2014 The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) September 26, 2019\n\nRead More", "description": "Late-night talk show hosts on Wednesday didn't miss a beat when it came to discussing a transcript of a phone conversation between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190926003307-late-night-seth-meyers-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
