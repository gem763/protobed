German discount grocer Lidl launched its \"Next Level Burger\" after Beyond Meat couldn't keep up with the incredible demand. (Lidl)\n\nBERLIN - \u201cVegan hype from the USA,\u201d shouted a May press release from a prominent German discount supermarket. \u201cThe Beyond Meat burger is now exclusively at Lidl.\u201d\n\nThe fake meat burger sold out mere hours after its debut in Lidl\u2019s 3,200 German stores in late May, sending customers into a frenzy \u2014 and sending Beyond Meat\u2019s stock (BYND) up almost 7%.\n\nIt seems as if it would be against all odds, but fake plant-based meat made an enormous splash in Germany, winning over a country famous for pork knuckle, schnitzel, blood sausage, bratwurst, liverwurst and about 1,500 other types of wurst. Meat is extremely cheap in Germany, so much so that French and Swiss carnivores who live close to the German border often do their shopping there.\n\nEven though meat is an integral part of Germany\u2019s culture, around 11% of the German population is vegetarian or vegan and many more are at least trying to eat less animal products. According to a recent YouGov poll, 63% of Germans are trying to reduce their meat consumption, making the country one of the most vegetarian places in the world. (Even a meat tax has been proposed recently.)\n\nAfter Lidl\u2019s brief supply was sold out in minutes in May, the community section of the company\u2019s Facebook page was filled with hangry vegans posting in a mix of anger and desperation. Wholesaler Metro had a sizable stock in Costco-like quantities, subtweeted Lidl. A few weeks later, Netto, another discount grocery chain began proudly offering the Beyond Meat \u201chype-burger\u201d as a special. Of course, it sold out there too.\n\nThe so-called \u201chype-burger\u201d (so nicknamed in the German media) continued its tour around German grocery stores, essentially as limited-time promotions, given the supply issues. Lidl got the burger back in June and, once again, it sold out within minutes, reigniting public ire. A Lidl representative ended up apologizing to the public, saying they were trying hard but there were simply no more burgers left from the manufacturer on the market. According to one German website, some stores only received five packs in the promotion \u2014 not nearly enough to meet the demand.\n\nAs one website described the outrage: Lidl\u2019s bringing the burger to Germany had become \u201ceinem Mega-Shitstorm.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the summer, Lidl, Netto, and other German grocery stores learned two lessons: there was immense demand for fake meat, and that they\u2019d better start making their own \u2014 just in case. Somehow, only a few months after Beyond Meat made an enormous impact in Germany, its fake meat is on the way to becoming a commodity.\n\nWhere\u2019s the \u2018meat\u2019?\n\nToday the viral fake meat (\u201cFleischersatz\u201d) can be found in German grocery stores, but even a few months later it\u2019s remained somewhat scarce, much to the chagrin of German vegetarians, vegans, and flexitarians.\n\n\u201cI'm curious about the Beyond Meat burger,\u201d one Twitter user wrote. \"So far I have not had the pleasure.\"\n\n\u201cI wanted to eat a Beyond Meat burger yesterday,\u201d said another. \u201cThere was no more Beyond Meat. This made me sad.\u201d\n\nBeyond Meat told Yahoo Finance that it\u2019s \u201cexcited that the demand for plant-based proteins has grown in Europe and continues to increase in popularity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're happy to be able to provide and meet the growing demand. We have plans to expand our European distribution and are opening a production facility in Holland in the near future,\u201d the company said.\n\nBut it\u2019s clearly not enough \u2014 or at least it wasn\u2019t enough to convince the retailers. If you go into a Lidl today, you\u2019ll see the \u201cNext Level Burger,\u201d which looks like a Beyond Meat burger with similar branding \u2013 potentially similar enough that you\u2019d be surprised there hasn\u2019t been a lawsuit.\n\n\u201cIt would be a gross understatement to claim that the discounter has been \u2018inspired\u2019 by its American counterpart,\u201d wrote Bavaria\u2019s biggest newspaper, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. \u201cLidl has almost completely copied the \u2018Next Level Burger\u2019 from Beyond Meat.\u201d\n\nLidl\u2019s \u201cNext Level Burger\u201d arrived in August, and it would have undercut Beyond Meat \u2014 if the hype-burger was there to compete. In addition to lower prices than Beyond Meat and \u201cguaranteed sufficient product availability,\u201d Lidl noted that producing the patties in Germany means less of a carbon footprint.", "description": "There weren't enough Beyond Meat burgers to keep up with demand from German consumers this summer, so grocery chains made their own generic versions.", "authors": ["Ethan Wolff-Mann", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F7auP7lGPYuMsooCkTn.Kg--~B/aD0zNTQzO3c9NTMxNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/0e5e2350-e522-11e9-b9ce-779e0e1ecc9d"}
