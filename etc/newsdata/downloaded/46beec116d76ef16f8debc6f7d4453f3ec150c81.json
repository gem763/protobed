REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - British Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L) said it will achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, becoming the first major airlines group to make such a commitment.\n\nThe aviation industry is under intense pressure from climate change activist such as Extinction Rebellion, which is aiming to shut down London\u2019s City Airport on Thursday.\n\nIAG said it would achieve its target with steps such as carbon offsetting for British Airways\u2019 domestic flights from 2020, investing in sustainable aviation fuel and replacing older aircraft with more efficient jets over the next five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re investing in new aircraft and innovative technology to reduce our carbon footprint in an industry where there\u2019s no current alternative to jet fuel,\u201d IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh said in a statement.\n\nIAG said the steps would help the airline contribute both to Britain\u2019s goal for a net zero carbon economy by 2050 and a United Nations objective to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.\n\nProtesters say cheap and easy short-haul flying will make it impossible for Britain it meet its climate goals and will have dire consequences for the world.\n\nWalsh said that aviation represented only 2% of global CO2 emissions, and that the airline group\u2019s steps were one part of a broader solution to make aviation less polluting.\n\n\u201cAviation\u2019s dependency on fossil fuels means that it\u2019s essential that governments support its efforts to decarbonise by providing incentives to accelerate investment in new technologies,\u201d he said\n\n\u201cGlobal warming needs a global solution and all these initiatives will help limit the world\u2019s temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.\u201d", "description": "British Airways owner IAG said it will achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, becoming the first major airlines group to make such a commitment.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439182920&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990KN", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
