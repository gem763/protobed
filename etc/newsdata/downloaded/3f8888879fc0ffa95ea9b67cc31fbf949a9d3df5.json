That\u2019s a minimum threshold which companies must meet to ensure the safety of their employees.\n\nAfter the Mexico City earthquake, at least one Fortune 500 insurance company found its services lacking. It took two weeks for the company to contact all of its employees and account for everyone.\n\nSo the company turned to a new Washington-based startup called Base Operations to see if they could do a better job.\n\nFounded by a former security and risk management consultant, Cory Siskind, Base Operations uses a suite of hosted software services and mobile applications to provide security updates to corporate customers and their employees.\n\nThe insurance company tested Base Operations\u2019 check-in feature to see how it would perform in a simulated natural disaster and Siskind said that Base Operations had identified the location of 80% of the company\u2019s workforce in less than two days. More than half of the company\u2019s employees checked in within the first 24 hours.\n\nBase Operations offers a dashboard for corporate customers to monitor their employees\u2019 locations and for staff traveling abroad, the company has an app that provides geo-tagged alerts on potential risks based on an individual\u2019s location.\n\n\u201cThis is a compliance situation for companies\u2026 They have to do it,\u201d says Siskind. \u201cWe work with a company\u2019s chief security officers and travel security. If you send people off into an emerging market with a risk PDF\u2026 It\u2019s not dynamic information and it just sits in a report and nobody reads it.\u201d\n\nCompanies with a sales or marketing team traveling around need to have some sort of tool to meet their compliance regulations and duty of care standards, says Siskind.\n\n\u201cWe have a whole set of features that nudge towards safer behaviors so that you don\u2019t end up getting mugged and so that you don\u2019t end up in a situation that would be damaging to you,\u201d she says.\n\nSiskind recently raised $1 million for Base Operations from investors including Glasswing Ventures, Spiro Ventures, the Latin American early-stage investment firm Magma Partners and Good Growth Capital. Base Operations graduated from Techstars Impact Accelerator in 2018.\n\nThe money from the company\u2019s most recent round will be used to expand the company\u2019s sales and marketing efforts and continue its research and development.\n\nSo far, the company has three customers, including the undisclosed insurance provider, the energy company Enel and another, yet unnamed, corporation.\n\nBase Operations provides its services in 15 cities, including: Mexico City, S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Santiago, San Juan (Puerto Rico) and San Jose (Costa Rica).", "description": "In 2017, when a destructive earthquake struck Puebla, Mexico, sending shock waves to Mexico City and destroying buildings in the nation\u2019s megalopolis and its surrounding suburbs, both public and private emergency services sprung into action.
