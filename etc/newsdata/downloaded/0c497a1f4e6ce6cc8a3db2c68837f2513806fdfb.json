Tulsi Gabbard speaks at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa, August 9, 2019. (Scott Morgan/Reuters)\n\nAs our Tobias Hoonhout reports, Representative Tulsi Gabbard says she\u2019s thinking of not attending next week\u2019s debate to protest the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThe DNC and corporate media are essentially trying to usurp your role as voters in choosing who our Democratic nominee will be.\u201d\n\nGabbard accuses the DNC and corporate media of trying to \u201creplace the roles of voters in the early states, using polling and other arbitrary methods, which are not transparent or democratic, and holding so-called debates which really are not debates at all, but rather commercialized reality television meant to entertain, rather than to inform or enlighten.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGabbard\u2019s compliant contains an inherent contradiction. Even after the past few candidates dropped out, there are still 19 Democratic candidates running for president: Colorado senator Michael Bennet, former vice president Joe Biden, New Jersey senator Cory Booker, Montana governor Steve Bullock, South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, former HUD secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, former Maryland congressman John Delaney, Gabbard, California senator Kamala Harris, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, Miramar, Fla. mayor Wayne Messam, former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019 Rourke, Ohio congressman Tim Ryan, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, former Pennsylvania congressman Joe Sestak, billionaire Tom Steyer, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, and author Marianne Williamson.\n\nThe networks and DNC are not being mean or unfair when they set a threshold for debate participation. You don\u2019t get to be in the debates just because you decided to run. The DNC and the networks started this cycle with two debates where the top twenty candidates were on stage. Are there masses clamoring for more Tim Ryan or Michael Bennet? How many viewers felt like the last debate was empty and meaningless without Steve Bullock? How many Democratic primary voters feel like they\u2019ve been cheated by not getting a chance to hear from Wayne Messam? For what it\u2019s worth, I kind of like Williamson and Sestak. But Williamson\u2019s best number in any state or nationally in the RealClearPolitics average is 0.7, and Sestak\u2019s at a perfect 0.0. I cannot, with a straight face, argue that their exclusion is a grand injustice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe the level of support in polls and the number of donors are imperfect measuring sticks. But what are the fairer alternatives? Yes, meeting the threshold for participation will be more difficult for lesser-known candidates who don\u2019t have a broad network of donors. Shockingly, it turns out running for president is harder for obscure candidates who have a hard time raising money. Why, it\u2019s almost as if people who want to run for president should attempt to raise their name recognition and broaden their base of support before they start running.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Gabbard \u2014 a really good debater, by the way \u2014 thinks the debates have not been informative or enlightening, a major factor is probably the abbreviated time for answers, like the one minute and fifteen seconds limit in the last debate. The short time limit is because there are so many candidates on stage! If you want more time per candidate, have fewer candidates on stage. If you want more candidates on stage, you need to accept shorter time limits for answers, unless you want the debates to be more than three hours long. Or perhaps some masochist out there wants the debate spread out over three nights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe threat to stay home is an uncharacteristically implausible one from Gabbard. She missed the last debate but collected enough donations and did well enough in the polls to make this coming debate. If she goes through with it and skips the debate, it will be a genuinely surprising gesture of defiance \u2014 and one that will probably leave the other candidates breathing a sigh of relief, having seen Gabbard dissect Kamala Harris\u2019 record as a prosecutor with ruthless precision. But Gabbard would be giving up one more appearance in the national spotlight \u2014 perhaps her last.", "description": "It would be a major gesture of defiance, but would seriously impair her candidacy chances.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Victor Davis Hanson", "John Mccormack", "A.
