In the 1950's, Gibson became the first black player to win a major championship.\n\nAlthea Gibson was talented on the court, but lonely off it. In 1955, she met her match in Angela Buxton, England's top player.\n\n\"Nobody even spoke to her, let alone played with her in her own country,\" Buxton said.\n\nBuxton is Jewish, and back then wasn't embraced either.\n\n\"Not once did the British girls invite me to join them for a meal. Not once,\" she said.\n\nAmerican tennis player Althea Gibson in action against American Darlene Hard at Beckenham on June 15, 1957. Getty\n\nThe similar indignities created a bond. They became doubles partners and won the French Open and Wimbledon in 1956. One newspaper reported the historic feat with a two word headline: \"Minorities win.\"\n\nTheir decades-long friendship would be tested in 1995 when a 68-year-old Gibson called Buxton out of the blue.\n\n\"She said, 'Well, I've run out of money, and I can't stand it any longer. So I've decided to kill myself,'\" Buxton said.\n\nGibson was sick and couldn't afford medicine or rent. At the time, players weren't allowed to make money from sponsors. So Buxton published a letter about Gibson's plight and fans responded with almost $1 million in donations.\n\nGibson died in 2003. Today, 85-year-old Buxton was happy to travel across the pond to attend a ceremony honoring the memory of her friend.\n\n\"The hotels may say on the outside, 'No blacks allowed,' or, or Jews, for that matter. And all that nonsense she had to face. You know?\" Buxton said. \"She got the last laugh.\"", "description": "When Buxton and Gibson met in 1955, they formed a bond both on and off the court", "authors": ["Alvin Patrick", "Maurice Dubois"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/26/e4384786-1c75-430f-ba9c-b7676dce231f/thumbnail/1200x630/52687361f91ac7e8d536a07e6104bb8e/gettyimages-1170341918.jpg"}
