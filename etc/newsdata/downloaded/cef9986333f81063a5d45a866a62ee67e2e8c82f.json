It\u2019s a huge political thing. But we are leaders, and we can step up at a times, but you don\u2019t feel like you should upon things you shouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\n\"I talked about it yesterday\u2026I'm talking about it now but I'm not talking about it again.\" @KingJames discusses shifting the preseason focus to the #Lakers winning a championship. pic.twitter.com/7KUfgzroCM \u2014 Spectrum SportsNet (@SpectrumSN) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s things that happen in my own community, trying to help my kids graduate high school and go off to college,\u201d he added. \u201cTrying to make sure the inner-city kids that grew up in my hometown can have a brighter future and look at me as inspiration to get out of the hellhole of the inner city. And we don\u2019t talk about those stories enough.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, James said he believes Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey \u201cwas either misinformed or not really educated on the situation\u201d regarding the potential consequences of his actions when he tweeted in support of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protests.\n\n\u201cYes, we do have freedom of speech,\u201d James said. \u201cBut at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others, when you only think about yourself. I don\u2019t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke. So many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, it can be a lot of negative that comes with it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to clarify his thoughts, James went further.\n\n\u201cI believe (Morey) was either misinformed or not really educated on the situation, and if he was, then so be it,\u201d James said. \u201cBut I have no idea. That\u2019s just my belief. When you say things or do things, you\u2019re doing it and you know the people that can be affected by it, and the families and the individuals and everyone that can be affected by it. Sometimes things can be challenging as well. Also sometimes, social media is not always the proper way to go about things as well. But that\u2019s just my belief.\u201d\n\nIn Hong Kong, protesters burned and stomped on James jerseys during a rally Tuesday at the Southorn Playground. They threw basketballs at a photo of James and chanted support for Morey and criticism about James\u2019 comments.\n\nProtesters in Hong Kong burn LeBron jerseys: Protestors gathered on courts amid Hong Kong's high-rise buildings to vent their anger and set fire to LeBron James jerseys after the Lakers star's comments about free speech. https://t.co/VAPIVHyBro pic.twitter.com/OPxbCjURDh \u2014 StubOrder.com \ud83c\udf9f\ud83d\udcba (@StubOrder) October 15, 2019\n\nThe comments also set off swift reaction on social media, with many listeners perceiving James\u2019 remarks as criticism of the democracy movement in Hong Kong. James addressed the issue again in two tweets before the Lakers\u2019 preseason game against Golden State at Staples Center.\n\n\u201cLet me clear up the confusion,\u201d James tweeted. \u201cI do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that\u2026 My team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it.\u201d\n\nLet me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet.

I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nAmong the critics of James\u2019 comments Monday night was Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL). The former Florida governor, who has been critical of James in the past dating back to his decision to leave the Miami Heat in 2014, posted on Twitter that James \u201cis the one who isn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand. It\u2019s sad to see him join the chorus kowtowing to Communist China & putting profits over human rights.\u201d\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) also slammed James, calling the comments \u201cgarbage\u201d and \u201chard to take.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving just been in Hong Kong \u2013 on the streets & with the protestors \u2013 this kind of garbage is hard to take. LeBron, are YOU educated on \u201cthe situation\u201d? Why don\u2019t you go to Hong Kong? Why don\u2019t you meet the people there risking their lives for their most basic liberties,\u201d Hawley wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThis statement is unbelievable. \u201cSo many people could have been harmed\u201d? By Daryl Morey daring to express sympathy for democracy? News flash: people ARE being harmed \u2013 shot, beaten, gassed \u2013 right now in Hong Kong. By China. By the Communist Party the NBA is so eager to appease,\u201d the lawmaker added.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Hoops star LeBron James said he will no longer comment on the China-NBA scandal following the backlash he received.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-621514010-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
