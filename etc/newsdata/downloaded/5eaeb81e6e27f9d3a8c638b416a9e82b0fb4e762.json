(Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg)\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the fifth-richest person in the world, both questioned and defended the existence of billionaires like himself during a live-streamed company town hall on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have. At some level, no one deserves to have that much money,\u201d said Zuckerberg, who has a net worth of around $69 billion.\n\nThe company decided to air the usually private weekly Q&A session after the Verge published transcripts from an earlier town hall, in which Zuckerberg expressed concern about Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposal to break up the company if she were elected president.\n\n[Zuckerberg promised to 'fight\u2019 efforts by Sen. Warren to break up Facebook in leaked comments]\n\nZuckerberg kicked off the session Thursday by saying that many internally were shocked by the leak but that he stands by those comments. CFO Sheryl Sandberg also made a brief appearance.\n\nThe hour-long session touched on topics such as the impact of end-to-end encryption, cracking down on child exploitation and disinformation, working remotely and even Facebook Dating.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try not to antagonize her further,\u201d Zuckerberg said of Warren when an employee asked the chief executive how he could stay impartial on the candidate.\n\n[U.S., allies ask Facebook not to expand encryption on its services]\n\nHe went on to say Facebook would not be impartial because the company would not value its own policy outcomes over the health of civic discourse and people\u2019s ability to express their opinions.\n\n\u201cI would rather have someone get elected, even if I disagree with them on everything \u2014 which I don\u2019t even think is the case here \u2014 than not give them the ability to say what they think,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the topic of his wealth, he added that he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have dedicated to giving away most of their money during their lifetimes, something he admitted some don\u2019t think is enough.\n\n[Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pays rare D.C. visit to meet with lawmakers]\n\nThe CEO also addressed criticisms of Facebook\u2019s plans to add end-to-end encryption to all its messaging products, a security measure that limits anyone other than the sender and recipient from being able to read the messages.\n\nThe United States joined Britain and Australia in calling on Facebook to reverse its plans to add end-to-end encryption to its messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger. Critics claim the added layer of security, without a back door for governments, will make it harder for law enforcement to investigate crimes by accessing messages. Some critics say will make it harder to catch people trading child pornography.\n\n\u201cWhen we were deciding to go to end-to-end encryption across the different apps \u2026 one of the things that just weighed the most heavily on me is \u2018How do we make sure we do a good job on this?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve basically figured out is that often, it\u2019s not looking at the content that\u2019s most important, it\u2019s looking at the patterns of activity, and you can do that even in encrypted systems.\u201d", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg answered town hall questions during a live stream Thursday.", "authors": ["Heather Kelly", "Technology Reporter", "October At Pm", "Heather Kelly Is A Reporter Covering The Ways Technology Affects Everyday Life.
