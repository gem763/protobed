Williams reported to the facility Tuesday, and the Redskins got a roster exemption for him.\n\nWilliams did not practice Wednesday and was not in the locker room when it was open to reporters. Callahan, who was offensive line coach before taking over for the fired Jay Gruden, says he spoke with Williams for an hour and that the 31-year-old took part in morning meetings.\n\nCallahan was noncommittal about whether Williams would play for Washington this season.
