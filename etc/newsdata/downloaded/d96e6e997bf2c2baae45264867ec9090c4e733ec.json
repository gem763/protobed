REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo\n\nLagarde, a former finance minister of France and head of the International Monetary Fund, will replace Mario Draghi at the helm of the ECB on Nov. 1.\n\nShe is set to become the first ECB president with no formal training in economics.\n\n\u201cCentral bankers have sometimes been working in an ivory tower,\u201d de Guindos, a former Spanish finance minister, told Spanish daily El Pais.\n\n\u201cChristine Lagarde \u2013 not to mention myself \u2013 is well versed in the euro area\u2019s mechanisms. The ECB\u2019s decision-makers need to understand the context, make sound choices from among the alternatives and communicate appropriately,\u201d he added in the interview conducted on Oct. 11.\n\nThe ECB has been trying - and largely failing - to get euro zone governments that run budget surpluses, such as those of Germany and the Netherlands, to loosen their purse strings and support economic growth.\n\nDe Guindos defended the ECB\u2019s aggressive stimulus measures, which saw it push its deposit rate further below zero last month and resume a bond-buying program that already totaled 2.6 trillion euro despite opposition from several policymakers.\n\nBut he reaffirmed the side effects of those policies were becoming increasingly apparent and inflation was being kept below the ECB\u2019s target of just under 2% by forces outside of its control.\n\n\u201cInflation has indeed been below the objective for some time, but behind this there are structural changes for which we don\u2019t yet have a full explanation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe euro\u2019s exchange rate and some market-based interest rates have risen since the ECB unveiled its latest package as a public revolt among policymakers against more money-printing was seen capping the scope for further easing.\n\nDe Guindos said the public divisions \u201cwere not contributing to the effectiveness of the policies\u201d and called for all rate-setters to back decisions once they are taken.", "description": "Christine Lagarde will ensure European Central Bank policymakers climb down from their \"ivory tower\" and face the political realities of the euro zone, the ECB's vice president, Luis de Guindos, said in an interview published on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445138714&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P05L", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
