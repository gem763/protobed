How Aiia Maasarwe's horrific murder shocked a city", "language": "en", "text": "Advertisement\n\nWhen Codey Herrmann set alight Aiia Maasarwe, police could not be certain she was dead.\n\nHerrmann himself could not have known either. He certainly didn't stop to check before he shook up a can of WD 40 and sprayed it all over her battered body.\n\nMoments earlier he had bashed her head in with a metal pipe before dragging her into the bushes and having his way with her.\n\nWannabe rapper Codey Herrmann set alight Aiia Maasarwe after bashing her head in and raping her after she got off a tram at night\n\nAiia Maasarwe had been on the phone to her sister when she was attacked from behind. She suffered a brutal rape before she was bashed and set on fire\n\nIt was a brutal attack.\n\nHe strangled Aiia with such violence that it broke a bone in her neck.\n\nThe rape was with such 'force and ferocity' that it caused her unimaginable injuries.\n\nWhen done, the miserable loner clubbed her head in again with the same pipe he had used to subdue her.\n\nHermann had watched enough movies to know his DNA would have been all over the place.\n\nBefore making his getaway, he pulled a barbecue lighter from his grubby pants pocket and set her alight.\n\nIt was a cruel act that in the end would do little to cover-up his wicked moment of pleasure.\n\nAt Herrmann's pre-sentence plea in Melbourne this week, prosecutor Patrick Bourke claimed Herrmann had 'complete and utter disregard for the humanity of the victim'.\n\n'It strikes at the liberty of all, but of course in particular women, to do no more than walk down a public street in peace and safety,' he said.\n\nDoctors trained in the art of trying to put reason to the unreasonable would go onto make explanations for Herrmann's actions that many of victim of crime has heard before.\n\nTough childhood, tough life.\n\nForensic psychiatrist Andrew Carroll told the Supreme Court of Victoria Herrmann attacked his victim in an 'eruption of suppressed rage' he harboured towards the world.\n\nAdrian Bayley, Scott Miller, Sean Price and Jaymes Todd all murdered women they had never met before.\n\nHenry Richard Hammond is charged with killing 25-year-old Courtney Herron\n\n'This is the manifestation of male rage towards a female,' the psychiatrist said, adding the rape and murder were an example of 'stereotypical, primitive male rage'.\n\nIn a letter of apology to Aiia's parents, Herrmann gave little insight into what drove him to murder.\n\n'There is no excuse. I truly apologise, I will pray for you and your family everyday,' he wrote.\n\n'Don't give in to hate like I did.'\n\n'Don't give into hate like I did': Herrmann's apology letter to Aiia's devastated parents\n\nIt was a line that could have been taken straight out of the mouth of Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who warned hate leads to the dark side.\n\nIt's a dark side ordinary women of Melbourne have been living in fear of for the good part of the past decade.\n\nIt was almost this time in 2012 when 29-year-old Jill Meagher was raped and murdered in Melbourne by serial sex offender Adrian Bayley.\n\nIt was a murder mystery that struck at the core of ordinary women's fears about simply walking down the streets alone at night.\n\nJill Meagher had been walking just down the street to her home when she was attacked from behind by Adrian Bayley. She fought Bayley and he raped and killed her\n\nJill Meagher and her brother Michael Meagher. Ms Meagher vanished after a night out with work friends. Melburnians hoped she would be found alive and well. She had been raped and murdered\n\nMs Meagher was plucked off a Brunswick street and never seen alive again.\n\nFor a full week Melburnians hoped and prayed that she would be found alive.\n\nWhen her body was recovered at a lonely, shallow grave beside a dirt road a day before the AFL grand final, a town usually in celebration wept.\n\nBayley is serving a life sentence in prison, with a non-parole period of 35 years, for the rape and murder of Ms Meagher.\n\nMs Meagher's death saw thousands take to the streets in unity in the hope of somehow willing the end of violence against women.\n\nBut the killings would continue and the excuses would all be familiar.\n\nOnly a few years later the battered body of Yuk Ling Lau was found in the King's Domain Gardens just outside of the CBD.\n\nShe had been beaten unconscious and raped near the police memorial.\n\nYuk Ling Lau tried running away from here killer Scott Miller but was unable to escape. He raped and murdered her in a Melbourne park\n\nScott Miller pleaded guilty to two counts of rape and the murder of pastry chef Yuk Ling Lau, 32, whom he attacked as she walked to work early one morning in June 2014\n\nA nationwide manhunt took place to find her killer.\n\nHomeless man Scott Miller was eventually captured and sentenced to 33 years in prison with a minimum term of 28 years over Ms Lau's murder.\n\nShe had only been 32-years old.\n\nIn sentencing, Justice Betty King told Miller, his actions were 'every woman's and every parents' worst nightmare'.\n\n'Women walk around our city, suburbs, to work, often alone, and they feel safe,' Justice King said.\n\n'They are comforted this is a safe and civilised society in which we live.'\n\nBut no-one really felt safe anymore. And Melbourne's streets have become a game of Russian Roulette for young women with an entitled right to walk them whenever they please.\n\nA little over a year later, Melburnians would be shocked again with the horrific daylight murder of 17-year old Masa Vukotic.\n\nEveryone knew Sean Christian Price was a ticking time bomb. He had told authorities that himself.\n\n17-year old Masa Vukotic was butchered by crazed killer Sean Price. Price should never have been on the streets.\n\nPrice was free on bail for outstanding offences and on a 10 year supervision order when he killed Masa Vukotic\n\nBut on March 17, 2015, Price would take his evil to a monstrous new level in a crime that shocked Australia.\n\n'I just f**king had to kill her, man. I f**king had to kill her,\u2019 Price told police - detailing the exact moment when he decided to savagely murder the teenager.\n\nMasa had been at school that day and had enjoyed a meal with her family at their Doncaster home in north-east Melbourne before telling them she was going for a stroll.\n\nShe took her mobile phone and house keys with her.\n\nIt was the last time they saw their daughter alive.\n\n'This chick was on the other side of the road and she\u2019s coming up, yeah and she\u2019s like started talking to a bird like f**king Snow White,' Price later told police.\n\nDespite his atrocious criminal history, Price was free on bail for outstanding offences and on a 10 year supervision order made in the County Court in 2012.\n\nIn his sights, Price took the the knife from a bag he was carrying and ran up to her.\n\nHe pushed her into the bushes where she pleaded with Price not to hurt her.\n\nMasa told Price she would do anything he wanted her to do.\n\nPrice ignored her and began stabbing.\n\n'I just f**king started ripping and stabbing and f**king just stabbing,' he told police.\n\nJustice Lex Lasry sentenced him to life in prison with a non-parole period of 38 years.\n\nMove forward to 2018 and the unimaginable happened again.\n\nMelbourne comedian Eurydice Dixon was raped and murdered as she walked home after performing comedy in the city on June 12 last year.\n\nJaymes Todd, 20, was last month sentenced to life in prison with a 35-year non-parole period for the crime.\n\nMelbourne comedian Eurydice Dixon was raped and murdered as she walked home. Her killer is now appealing his sentence\n\nCourtney Herron's body was found by a dog walker in May at Royal Park at Parkville. She allegedly knew the man who accused of killing her\n\nTodd was obsessed with and addicted to a fantasy of 'coercive rape' which escalated to include fantasies of death, and he searched the internet for snuff films which depicted violent sexual encounters ending in death.\n\nMs Dixon's death disturbed a deeply disturbed city which was about to be hit again with even more blood of an innocent woman.\n\nCourtney Herron's body was found by a dog walker in May at Royal Park at Parkville.\n\nPolice described her attack as 'horrendous' and it sent shivers down spines.\n\nMembers of the public lay floral tributes at the site where Ms Herron\u2019s body was found, which was a short distance from Princes Park, where Eurydice Dixon\u2019s body was found less than a year earlier.\n\nShe had been the fourth woman killed in a public place in Victoria in the previous 12 months.\n\nAgain, it sparked calls from politicians and police for men to reflect on their behaviour.\n\nHenry Richard Hammond, 27, stands accused of her murder.\n\nA court was told in May Hammond had a number of issues that would affect him in custody, including 'a diagnosis of possible delusional disorder, possible autism spectrum disorder and historical diagnosis of ADHD'.\n\nWhile he remains in custody awaiting justice, barristers for killer Jaymes Todd prepare to appeal his sentence to a higher court.\n\nThe outcome is likely to impact on any sentence dished out to Herrmann.\n\nBarristers for Todd will argue the sentencing judge got it wrong and he ought be cut loose years earlier.\n\nThe wheels of justice will move slowly forward as a city drenched in blood awaits another shocking headline.", "description": "When Codey Herrmann set alight Aiia Maasarwe Melbourne police could not be certain she was dead.", "authors": ["Wayne Flower In Melbourne For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/02/19279120-0-image-a-52_1570151191107.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
