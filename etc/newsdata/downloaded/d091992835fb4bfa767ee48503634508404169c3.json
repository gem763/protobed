Its IPO has been shelved, and two WeWork executives \u2014 Arthur Minson and Sebastian Gunningham \u2014 took over as co-CEOs after Neumann left his CEO post.\n\nBut before its IPO plans were plagued by uncertainty and intense scrutiny, co-founder Adam Neumann opened the first WeWork space in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City in 2010. Since then, the company has rebranded as The We Company and expanded into other ventures, including co-living subsidiary WeLive and the \"conscious entrepreneurial school\" WeGrow, among others.\n\nRead on for the history of WeWork leading up to its first failed IPO attempt and the controversy surrounding Neumann.\n\nMelia Robinson originally authored this post, which has since been updated.
