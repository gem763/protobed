He was also witty, joking with Biden after Biden gestured at him while talking about Vladimir Putin. \u201cAre you suggesting I\u2019m Vladimir Putin?\u201d Sanders asked jokingly before the two men embraced. At another point, Cory Booker noted Sanders supports medical marijuana, and Sanders responded, \u201cBut I\u2019m not on it tonight.\u201d Sanders has been accused of being humorless and a little dry \u2014 even overly angry \u2014 sometimes. He also has a perception issue thanks to his health problem. Fighting that off was the most important thing he could do Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAmy Klobuchar: The Minnesota senator arguably made herself Warren\u2019s chief foil in this debate, creating contrasts on taxes, Medicare-for-all and other issues. At one point, she rejected the charge that she was creating a Republican talking point by pressing Warren on whether her Medicare-for-all proposal would raise taxes on the middle class. \u201cYou are making Republican talking points right here in this room\u201d by talking about getting rid of private insurance, Klobuchar charged. And she wasn\u2019t wrong. At another point, she hit back at Warren by saying, \u201cI think simply because you have different ideas doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re [not] fighting for regular people.\u201d All of this said, being the attacker in these debates hasn\u2019t always meant much. See: Castro, Julian and Delaney, John. But Klobuchar needs to try something, especially since she\u2019s fighting to make the fifth debate; we\u2019ll see if voters are buying it. (One piece of advice, on behalf of all of Klobuchar\u2019s fellow Minnesotans: the bad jokes need to stop.)\n\nMillennials: There was a point in the middle of the debate when South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) had an impassioned debate about whether the U.S. should be in Syria. Gabbard was the most noninterventionist candidate on the stage, while Buttigieg argued Syria was perhaps the one place in the Middle East where we continue to need a presence. That disagreement aside, this was two millennial veterans of Middle East wars \u2014 the only two combat veterans among the leading candidates \u2014 having that debate on a presidential stage. That\u2019s quite the moment.\n\nAD\n\nAndrew Yang: He makes this list solely because some of his top issues \u2014 automation and universal basic income \u2014 got a real debate. Candidates shared his concerns about the impact of automation on jobs, to some degree, and some, including Castro and Gabbard, were even open to his idea to give every American $1,000 per month.\n\nAD\n\nWe should look for creative solutions to jobs lost to automation. I support piloting a Universal Basic Income program, but I don't think we should take away the entitlement programs that help keep working families afloat to do it. #DemDebate \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 16, 2019\n\nLosers\n\nBiden: Not only does he seem to no longer be the candidate his opponents fear most, but he was again somewhat off his game. He offered some odd figures on the middle-class costs of Medicare-for-all. He said \u201cexpidentially\u201d instead of \u201cexponentially.\u201d He mixed up Iraq with Afghanistan. He said he never discussed his son\u2019s Ukraine dealings with him, even though his son has said differently. And at the end of the debate, Biden said that he didn\u2019t mean to disrespect his opponents, but that \u201cI\u2019m the only one on this stage who has actually gotten anything really big done.\u201d His opponents bucked, with Warren pointing to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- and then suggesting that perhaps certain members of the Obama administration could have been more supportive. Biden hasn\u2019t really dropped in the polls as Warren has risen, but he\u2019s not showing the sharper version of himself that he probably needs to. And he seemed to be trying a little too hard at points on Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nBooker\u2019s Biden question gripe: We get it; there\u2019s no safer applause line than attacking the refs, and Democrats are angry about how 2016 was handled by the media. But some of the complaints about moderators\u2019 questions on Tuesday night just didn\u2019t really make sense. Booker took up the mantle we knew someone would when he attacked a question Biden faced about his son Hunter\u2019s overseas work. He called it \u201cdeja vu all over again\u201d from the 2016 election and accused the moderators of \u201celevating a lie and attacking a statesman.\u201d Except that question was fair. Anderson Cooper rightly noted that the major accusations President Trump has lodged against the Bidens are unsubstantiated \u2014 twice. Cooper also asked a very fair question about why Hunter Biden is ruling out working overseas if his dad becomes president, when they say there was nothing wrong with him doing it when his dad was vice president. Calling that \u201cattacking a statesman\u201d was melodramatic.\n\nAD\n\nBiden\u2019s answer to that question: Biden was asked that question twice, and he said three times, \u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d which isn\u2019t really an answer. He added the second time, \u201cMy son made a judgment. I\u2019m proud of the judgment he made.\u201d It\u2019s okay to point out Trump\u2019s allegations are baseless while acknowledging Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas work perhaps wasn\u2019t a great idea \u2014 which is what his new pledge tacitly seems to acknowledge.\n\nThe question Warren won\u2019t answer: Warren was given four chances to answer the question she has thus far refused to directly answer: Whether her Medicare-for-all proposal would increase taxes on the middle class. The fact that she passed each time wasn\u2019t surprising \u2014 she instead focuses on total costs going down for the middle class, including health care \u2014 but she did get pushback from across the stage, including from Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Beto O\u2019Rourke and even gently from Sanders, who again forthrightly admitted taxes would go up under his plan.\n\nAD\n\nTom Steyer: The one complete newcomer on the stage on Tuesday, he began by initially ignoring the question about impeachment (his pet issue) and saying that \u201ceveryone here is more decent and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House.\u201d He then waited for applause, which was slow coming and tepid. There are no second chances at first impressions, and Steyer \u2014 a billionaire whom Democrats have accused of buying his way on to the debate stage \u2014 didn\u2019t do anything in the debate to overcome that.\n\nAD\n\nIn-between\n\nWarren\u2019s answer on the Middle East: Warren at one point said, \u201cI think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way.\u201d The question was about Syria, but that\u2019s a very broad statement. She\u2019ll need to expound. Expect to hear more on this.\\\n\nWe need to get our troops out of Syria, but we need to do it the right way. Donald Trump has sucked up to dictators, cut and run on our allies, and worsened a humanitarian crisis in Syria. We need a president who makes our country and the world safer. #DemDebate \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 16, 2019\n\nButtigieg: We have repeatedly had him in the winner category, even as he hasn\u2019t really risen in the polls. On Tuesday, as in other debates, he was sharp and came prepared, but this time he was more combative. Some thought he was amazing; others thought he was grating. I actually come down somewhere in the middle.\n\nAD", "description": "Who won, who lost, and what changed.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Y9U54rqMdxt2Cj1bUbwKPQK6UDo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E36BEQHPXYI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
