He hopes a slew of meetings this week will break the impasse that could otherwise last months and see a third election in less than a year.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Both are short of the 61-seat majority required to rule leading to the stalemate.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That said, it is important that everyone understands that we will not relinquish our principles or our partners,\u201d he added.\n\nA joint statement released by both Likud and Blue and White said talks had so far been \u201cmatter-of-fact and held in good spirits\u201d and they would continue negotiations.\n\nIsraeli left-wing paper Haaretz wrote that both sides are so entrenched in their positions \u201cno Israeli president has ever faced the challenge now confronting Rivlin\u201d.\n\nWhile columnist Nahum Barnea in the Yediot Ahronot daily wrote that it is going to be \u201cdownright impossible\u201d to form a government based on the two larger parties.\n\nThe ultra-orthodox Sha party came in fourth in the elections with nine seats. Ending the results was ultra-orthodox United Torah Judaism and ultranationalist Yamina with seven seats, Labour\u2019s alliance secured six and the left-wing Democratic Camp secured five.", "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu is locked in fierce negotiations with his chief rival to break a crippling political deadlock after the final results of a fraught election last week showed that no side had won an outright majority of the parliament.", "authors": ["Bel Trew"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/19/09/Netanyahu-Israel-Gantz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
