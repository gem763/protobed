Meyers played footage of Trump claiming that Mitch McConnell told him personally that his call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was \u201cinnocent\u201d and \u201cperfect\u201d, something McConnell has since denied.\n\n\u201cEven Mitch McConnell won\u2019t back him up now,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cBy the end of this thing, Republicans are just going to pretend they don\u2019t know who he is.\u201d\n\nThis week also saw Republicans \u201cstorming\u201d secure proceedings with Congressman Matt Gaetz, comparing it to the movie 300. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t 300, that was like three,\u201d Meyers countered. \u201cIt makes your publicity stunt much less dramatic when you have to shuffle along like you\u2019re in a mall at Christmas.\u201d\n\nIt was later pointed out that many of the Republicans who forced their way in were actually allowed to be there in the first place. \u201cYou can\u2019t storm a room you\u2019re allowed to be in,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not called storming, that\u2019s entering.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert\n\nOn the Late Show, Stephen Colbert started by noting that Trump is supposed to be attending a World Series game on Sunday. \u201cOf course keep in mind we don\u2019t know for sure if it will last that long,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cTrump\u2019s presidency, I mean.\u201d\n\nHe then joked about Trump\u2019s gaffe this week that saw him state to a crowd that he\u2019d be building a border wall in Colorado. \u201cOnce they\u2019re done with that, they\u2019re building a naval base in Idaho,\u201d Colbert said.\n\nTrump later tweeted that this was a joke, starting the tweet with the word kiddingly. \u201cAs a fellow comedian, I get what he\u2019s doing here,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cWhen you tell a joke, it\u2019s very important to kick off the joke by saying kiddingly.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cTrump wishes the Democrats were kiddingly about impeachment.\u201d\n\nColbert also spoke about the Republican \u201cstorming\u201d that occurred this week, joking about the \u201clarge herd of white men\u201d that made their way into the secure proceedings. He played footage of Gaetz saying how much he cared for Trump and that he would never care about another president this much.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re like Romeo and Juliet except everyone else wants to kill themselves,\u201d Colbert quipped.\n\nThis week also saw Bernie Sanders unveil a plan to legalise marijuana, a popular headline with Colbert\u2019s audience. \u201cBernie and marijuana are two of the easiest cheer lines in showbiz,\u201d he said. Colbert then joked that Sanders\u2019 new slogan would be: \u201cFeel the Bern and hold it in until you start coughing.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts discussed the problems facing Republicans who are trying to defend Trump and his latest gaffe over the border wall.
