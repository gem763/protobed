Never! This applies at the federal, state and communal levels,\u201d the SPD secretary general, Lars Klingbeil, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe decision in Altenstadt is incredible and cannot be justified. It must be reversed.\u201d\n\nOn the streets of Waldsiedlung, residents seemed divided over the vote. \u201cThe problem is Jagsch is a very nice person who belongs to the wrong party and I am against promoting NPD members,\u201d said Ingo Waldschmidt.\n\nAnother resident, Karl-Heinz Boller, said the vote was wrong. \u201cI am outraged and it\u2019s beyond me how they could have voted for this man,\u201d he said. \u201cThis needs to be corrected.\u201d\n\nAli Riza Agdas, who represents the SPD on the council, told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung: \u201cI have known him [Jagsch] for years and have never had a problem with him.\u201d", "description": "Seven-member council backs Stefan Jagsch as he was the only person keen on the job", "authors": ["Reuters In Waldsiedlung"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5edea3ee29ecd550560b8e780517e146f3ac6321/0_233_5935_3561/master/5935.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=463fbfabbcbbff05edd20a0ad133eb1a", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
