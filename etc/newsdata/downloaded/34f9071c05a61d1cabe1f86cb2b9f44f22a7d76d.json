Somehow, Paris manages it. From political protests to skate and arts scenes, the historical city\u2019s streets and architecture have fast become a breeding ground for many modern movements.\n\nBehind it all is a generation of young people growing up in a society that\u2019s painted them as jaded; shaped by introspective ideas that hold no value in the real world. But go there and you\u2019ll find the opposite is underway.

As one girl tells us: \u201cWe realise what the world will look like tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWatch the documentary in full below:\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "In our new documentary, i-D hits the French capital and meets the teenagers making their mark on the city today.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da5b0c59ba232000aa318f1/lede/1571140089261-paris16yo.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
