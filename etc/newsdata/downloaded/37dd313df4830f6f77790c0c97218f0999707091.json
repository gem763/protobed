Overall, the law actually tended to reduce the number of children born and, by decreasing mothers\u2019 time at work, increase the time spent with children.\n\nNew mothers risked losing between $1,600 to $2,600 in the short-term if they took paid family leave, and up to $2,500 to $3,700 in the long run, the report found. If new mothers chose to take paid leave under the California law, they\u2019d likely receive about $1,833 in wage replacement for one year, but approximately $26,681 in lower earnings over the next decade, for a net 10-year loss of $24,000.\n\nRoughly 18 percent of all mothers and 26 percent of work-mothers took paid leave immediately after it was introduced.\n\n\u201cAlthough the Act was modest relative to typical paid leave policies in European countries, we find its implementation led to statistically significant and economically large declines in the employment and wage earnings of new mothers,\u201d the report found.\n\nOne argument in favor of paid leave is that it instills loyalty among a company\u2019s employees who choose to take advantage of it. However, the study dismissed that argument, noting that women who had access to paid leave were no more likely to remain with their pre-birth employer than women without paid leave access, both in the short and long term.\n\nOf course, proponents of paid family leave argue that not only is it an important issue for both men and women, but that it can actually help boost the company\u2019s bottom line.\n\nReddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who\u2019s married to tennis star Serena Williams, has emerged as an advocate for paid parental leave, meeting with lawmakers on Tuesday to push for change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kidding ourselves if we think our employees\u2019 home life has no effect on their work life,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a very crystal-clear business case for why this makes sense.\u201d\n\nFacebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has also become a proponent of paid leave, telling Fortune in an April 2018 interview that she supports the FAMILY Act, which would establish federally mandated paid leave.\n\n\"These are not trade-offs,\" Sandberg told the outlet. \"This is not a trade-off between your business goals and your goals of taking care of your people. You take care of your people? You meet your business goals. And I think we need to make sure that people aren\u2019t making trade-offs between taking care of their personal responsibilities and professional responsibilities.\"\n\nIn part, the effect on annual wages seems to be driven by reductions in the intensity of the woman\u2019s work -- essentially, they tend to work fewer hours and weeks, but also often shift professions, taking up jobs with lower wages and potentially greater non-wage compensation, the report found.\n\nCalifornia is one of five U.S. states that offers paid family leave. (Unlike most developed countries, the U.S. does not require companies to provide paid time off for new parents).\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Roughly 18 percent of all mothers and 26 percent of work-mothers took paid leave immediately after it was introduced.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/iStock-Nurse-midwives.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
