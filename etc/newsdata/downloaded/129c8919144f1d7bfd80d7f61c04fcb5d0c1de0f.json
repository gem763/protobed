It's exactly what happened to your rugby team yesterday,\n\n'They lost - suck it up', he taunted.\n\nMs Sturgeon replied: 'Absolutely - I lost the referendum in 2014. But I do believe in a democracy you're entitled to change your mind.'\n\nMs Sturgeon added that were Ms Morgan to be sacked from GMB - a proposal currently the subject of an online petition - she would miss their 'early morning jousts'.\n\nIt comes as a new poll showed support for Scottish independence has reached 50 per cent. The result in 2014 was 45 per cent in favour of independence, 55 per cent against.", "description": "Piers Morgan challenged Nicola\u00a0 Sturgeon to 'suck it up' comparing her defeat in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum to Scotland's rugby loss to Japan yesterday.", "authors": ["Joel Adams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/09/19682646-0-image-a-36_1571042977629.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
