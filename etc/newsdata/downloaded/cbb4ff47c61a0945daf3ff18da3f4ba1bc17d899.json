Photo: Peter Kramer/HBO\n\nAs Succession\u2019s Roy family has tried to extend their control over the media world this season, they\u2019ve run up against their bizarro-world counterparts in the Pierces, a blue-blooded but just as slimey media dynasty that controls a more prestigious, but less profitable news giant. They\u2019re led by the formidable Cherry Jones, who plays Nan Pierce as a \u201cwannabe Katharine Graham,\u201d often touting the importance of truth and moral character, but still willing to bend to the right amount of money.\n\nIn the season\u2019s fifth episode, Brian Cox\u2019s Logan Roy pushed the Pierces into a deal to sell their outfit, but this week, the deal collapses as New York Magazine (woohoo!) digs up dirt on Waystar\u2019s cruise ship division, and Nan realizes that her CEO Rhea Jarrell (Holly Hunter) is also playing her. While Rhea and Nan fall out during the episode, Jones tells Vulture she had an incredible amount of fun catching up with Hunter, an old friend from college, and working alongside the Succession cast, which \u201cfeels like a repertory company that have all been working exclusively together for about 10 years.\u201d Jones, who counts herself among the biggest Succession fans out there, caught us up on her college memories of Hunter, the improv behind that big dinner scene, and the texts she gets from J. Smith Cameron.\n\nTell me about the big confrontation between Nan and Rhea at the end of the episode. I love that you have to shout, \u201cGood riddance to bad rubbish!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the benefit of having a Brit write the script, you get to say things like that. It\u2019s perfect for Nan, that line. Holly and I went to Carnegie Mellon together and so we met in 1976, and this is the first time we\u2019ve ever gotten to work together. It was delicious getting to have that complicated relationship, with that Iago of hers. It all felt like college, you know? I was a couple of years older than Holly, so I didn\u2019t really even get to work with her in college.\n\nWhen we shot that final fiery scene between the three of us, we were in Lake Placid and it was snowing like crazy. The wind, it was cold, the snow was blowing. It was perfect. That fight, we had to do it several times because involved a lot of movement, and Brian, with his Shakespearean voice out there crying out in the night all of these obscenities. Literally echoing throughout the Adirondacks. I\u2019m sure they could hear him on the other side of Lake Champlain.\n\nI\u2019ve read that the actors do a lot of improv on set, especially in the big group scenes like the dinner scene in episode 5. What was it like filming that?\n\nThat dinner table scene, I\u2019ve never had so much fun shooting any \u2014 as a friend of mine used to always call any scene that had more than four people in it \u2014 \u201ctownspeople scene.\u201d We were all improvising during every take.\n\nJeremy Strong blew my mind, because he was seated on the other side of Holly and he was buttering me up. He was talking about the art in the house and the different artists who had done the sculptures in the garden. He was showing off all this knowledge. He was making up stuff about the fact that his mother had been on the board at Tate for many years. Jeremy Shamos, [who plays] cousin Mark the amateur astronomer, had everyone in absolute hysterics at his end of the table. When they would finally say, \u201ccut,\u201d no one really wanted to stop.\n\nWhat were you improvising as Nan?\n\nWell, Holly would occasionally make some wry remark about the beasts across the table from us. There was a good little bit of whispered improvisation there.\n\nThe writers have talked about building the vision for the Pierce family off old media families like the Bancrofts, the Sulzbergers, and the Grahams. Did that play into how you thought of Nan?\n\nBecause it\u2019s Succession, when I read the script I thought, \u201cThere is no one in this episode who is noble.\u201d [Executive producer] Frank Rich championed me for this role, and of course I knew Mr. Rich as the critic of the New York Times when I was starting out in New York, so his name always struck terror in any actors heart. In fact, Holly and J. Smith Cameron, we were talking about the fact that when we would walk past Frank\u2019s chair [on set], we were all so relieved that it no longer means what it used to mean to us when we were girls. But I wrote him and I said, \u201cThis being Succession, I know that Nan is not Katharine Graham. She\u2019s a Katharine Graham wannabe.\u201d Frank wrote back and said, \u201cShe\u2019s a bus and truck [a.k.a. a low-paying, non-union theater tour] Katharine Graham. But she\u2019s a damn good bus and truck Katharine Graham.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no mention of her having children or a spouse. When we were shooting it, you got a little bit more of the feeling that Naomi was my surrogate child, and was the daughter of my beloved late sister. I decided that Nan was not married, but that\u2019s always my choice. If it\u2019s left open, I always go with not married because it\u2019s instantly more interesting to me as an actor, if someone has complete autonomy and she\u2019s given her life to the corporation.\n\nThere\u2019s a telling moment with Nan when she tries to get the family cook, Rosa, to have a drink, ignoring how much work Rosa is doing.\n\nIsn\u2019t she awful? It\u2019s so awful. That\u2019s more telling than almost anything about that character, that she\u2019s so oblivious to what is required feeding these 18 privileged little pigs at the trough. I winced when I saw that, but I just thought, You do it with just absolute innocence, because that\u2019s what she is. It\u2019s wrong of me to say that that Nan is an innocent \u2014 innocent is the wrong word. Oblivious, and for someone as intelligent as Nan, one can say willful obliviousness when it comes to what is required to serve the Pierces.\n\nNoblesse oblige. That seems to be the way these folks move through the world, feeling that they are a gift to the world because of their beneficence. They\u2019re just trust fund babies getting their second doctorate so they can feel worthy.\n\nWhat was Holly Hunter like in college?\n\n\ufeffInsanely gifted, of course. I remember exactly where I met Holly. I was in the college bookshop and they had dividers across the room filled with books. One day I heard this [grumbling in imitation of Holly Hunter\u2019s voice] coming from the other side of one of these dividers. It was clearly a fellow southerner, and there weren\u2019t many Southerners up there, so I walked around and there was tiny Holly. She had on this classic leather jacket with the fringe, and she had on one of those leather patchwork quilt Baker Boy oversized caps low over her eyes. The culture there was just so different from anything either of us knew. From that point on, I sort of took her under my wing, though she certainly didn\u2019t need a wing for protection.\n\nIt\u2019s so wonderful getting back in touch with Holly, and with J. Smith-Cameron. It really was a solidifying moment for the three of us. J. is in my neighborhood and we\u2019re already making lunch plans for when I get back to New York. Holly and I will be seeing each other once I get back and she gets her boys squared away in school and everything. When you don\u2019t have children, it\u2019s just so marvelous when your friends\u2019 children finally grow up and get out of the house, because you get your friends back. Holly\u2019s not quite there yet, but she\u2019s getting closer.\n\nThere are all these interesting relationships between the women of Succession. Nan seems to see a little bit of a daughter figure in Shiv, whom she tries, and fails, to maneuver into control of Waystar.\n\nI think Nan\u2019s grabbing at straws and Shiv is the straw that seems will be the least offensive. You know who else I\u2019m really interested in? Hiam\u2019s role. That is such a fascinating character. We\u2019ve not seen as much of Hiam this season as last season, but I\u2019m so interested to see. There\u2019s some jealousy there with Rhea.\n\nWell, it\u2019s very fun to speculate about the show with a diehard fan.\n\nThey\u2019re everywhere! I was working with Michelle Dockery on this Apple show Defending Jacob that I did this spring and summer, and she is such a fan. If she would mention it to someone and they hadn\u2019t seen it, Michelle would all but back them up against a wall and start talking about why they had to start watching it.\n\nFor your sake, I hope Nan makes a return appearance in some future episode, though it may not be best for the Pierces to get entangled with the Roys again.\n\nIt was the most cruel parting. They practically had to pry me off one of the camera dollies to get me to go home. To J. Smith-Cameron, as they proceeded on their travels for the last episodes of this season, I kept saying, \u201cSend pictures, send pictures.\u201d She would send me text messages with these gorgeous photos of locations where they were shooting. I would always write back and say, \u201cYOU HAVE THE BEST JOB!\u201d Yes, if I could come play again, I would drop whatever I was doing and run.", "description": "Cherry Jones, who plays Nan Pierce in HBO\u2019s Succession, counts herself among the biggest Succession fans out there.
