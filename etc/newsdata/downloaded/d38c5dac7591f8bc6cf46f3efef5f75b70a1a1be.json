You don't want an election. Let's get on with the people's agenda.\"\n\nJohnson, the face of the Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum, added that if lawmakers voted to delay Brexit they would \"plainly chop the legs out from under the U.K. position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible.\"\n\nThe intervention by Johnson is part of the political chess game over Brexit ahead of Parliament's return from its summer break on Tuesday. In essence, Johnson is warning Parliament he will go for an election as early as Oct. 14 if they defy him.\n\nRebels and opponents of the government say Johnson is betting on an election that he will cast as being forced on him by opponents of Brexit in Parliament.\n\nDavid Gauke, former Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, says he will risk expulsion for the Conservative Party and vote to block a no-deal Brexit. (REUTERS)\n\nLawmakers opposed to a no-deal Brexit will seek on Tuesday to take control of parliamentary time on Wednesday to pass legislation which would force Johnson to seek a three-month delay to Brexit. If they defeat the government, Johnson will then seek an election.\n\nMore than three years since the United Kingdom voted 52 to 48 per cent to leave the European Union, it is still unclear on what terms, or indeed whether, Brexit will take place.\n\nTory MP to vote against party\n\nFormer justice minister David Gauke said in a newspaper column that he intends to vote against his party on Tuesday, when lawmakers opposed to a no-deal Brexit are seeking to take control of parliamentary time to force a delay.\n\nBritish conservative members of Parliament have been warned that their party whip would be withdrawn if they attempt to block a no-deal Brexit, effectively meaning that they would be expelled from the party.\n\n\"The national interest must come first. Leaving the EU without a deal on October 31 would damage our prosperity, security and risk the integrity of the United Kingdom,\" Gauke wrote in The Times.\n\n\"Today I will vote against my party's whip for the first time in over 14 years as a member of parliament,\" he wrote.\n\nNo-deal Brexit\n\nBritain's opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn speaks during a shadow cabinet meeting in Salford, Britain, Sept. 2, 2019. (Andrew Yates/Reuters)\n\nThe default position is that Britain will leave on Oct. 31 without a deal unless a divorce agreement is struck with the bloc and ratified by the British Parliament or legislation is passed to delay or revoke the departure notice.\n\nJohnson has cast rebels as EU \"collaborators\" who are undermining the government's negotiating hand in seeking a withdrawal agreement by blunting his threat of a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\"Their [the government's] strategy, to be honest, is to lose this week and then seek a general election,\" said David Gauke, a former justice minister who is one of the rebel Conservative lawmakers.\n\nJohnson has a working majority of just one seat in the 650-seat lower house of Parliament and British media suggested about 20 Conservative lawmakers were prepared to rebel against him.\n\nAn election would open up three main options: a Brexit-supporting government under Johnson, a Labour government led by veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn or a hung parliament that could lead to a coalition or minority government of some kind.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday he did not want an election as he called on lawmakers not to vote for a further delay to Brexit.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5267988.1567445863!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/britain-eu.jpg"}
