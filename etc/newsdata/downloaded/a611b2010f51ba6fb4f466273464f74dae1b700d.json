We are going to ensure that we get this deal done.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that with the support of good people, with whom we may have disagreed in the past but who respect democracy, we will get this deal done.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s chances of success are dependent on retaining the support of around 30 Brexit hardliners in the European Research Group, who voted down Theresa May\u2019s deal but backed him over the Letwin amendment.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage urged ERG members not to vote through the \u201crotten\u201d deal, calling instead for short extension to allow for an early election.\n\nMr Farage told Sky: \u201cI warn everybody, if this treaty goes through, nothing will have changed at all and I think far better to have a short delay and a general election where we might solve this because we\u2019ve got a Leave country \u2013 that hasn\u2019t changed one little bit \u2013 and a Remain parliament. A general election could just sort this out\u2026\u201d\n\nDismissing Mr Johnson\u2019s package, he said: \u201cThis is not Brexit\u2026 This is a rotten deal. If Boris Johnson had presented this six months ago to the House of Commons, the ERG - every man and woman \u2013 would have voted against it.\n\n\u201cI do understand, because of Brexit fatigue and anger in the country, the temptation to vote for it but it is nothing more than Brexit in name only, it will not solve anything, this will not end things.\u201d\n\nMr Farage said he was still open to an electoral pact with Johnson if the PM ditched his withdrawal agreement.\n\n\u201cIf Boris Johnson went to the country having pressed the reset button and said \u2018Look, it is either a simple free trade agreement or we\u2019re leaving with a clean break Brexit\u2019, I think then the prospect of building a Brexit alliance to fight the election is there,\u201d said the Brexit Party leader. \u201cAnd do you know something? That would win a very big majority in the next election.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2018s chances of securing parliamentary approval for his Brexit deal were boosted after ex-cabinet minister Amber Rudd said she will vote for it and expects most of the Tories expelled from the party over a previous Brexit rebellion to do the same.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/12/10/amber-ruidd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
