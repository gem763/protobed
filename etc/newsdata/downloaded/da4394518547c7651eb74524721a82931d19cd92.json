After turning in her dissertation, which took years of research to complete, she wanted to find a way to celebrate.\n\nKorie Mitchell/JessaCole Photography\n\n\"I\u2019m not super celebratory, but I wanted to do something that was fun,\" Humphrey said. \"Science can be very straight forward and I wanted to do something to commemorate what I did and take a moment to be proud of myself.\"\n\nHumphrey often joked throughout her doctorate program that her dissertation was her \"baby\" because of all the hard work, lack of sleep, back pain from sitting in front of her computer and weight gain from stress eating. Thinking about these factors, she recruited her photographer friend Korie Mitchell and decided to make a picture-perfect memory of her accomplishment.\n\nKorie Mitchell/JessaCole Photography\n\nHumphrey and Mitchell did a \"newborn\" photoshoot of Humphrey holding her dissertation as her baby. Humphrey created a sign with the typical \"baby\" milestones that people celebrate and even placed her dissertation in a baby chair.\n\nThe photos were posted to Facebook with a caption that read, \"Six years ago, I started on a journey and I didn\u2019t know how hard it would be to finish. I gained weight, I experienced back pain, I cried a lot \u2026 was I pregnant,\" Humphrey wrote on her Facebook post with the pictures. \"So I would like to introduce toy all to my creation, 6 years of pushing and it gave me a new name. Hi, I\u2019m Dr. Eve Humphrey, PhD.\"\n\nKorie Mitchell/JessaCole Photography\n\nHumphrey thought it was would be a funny way to celebrate getting her doctorate and something that would make her friends and family laugh. She had no idea that it would be shared over 10,000 times on Facebook.\n\n\"I was like, 'What the heck?'\" Humphrey said. \"My husband told me it had a ton of 'likes' and then it started being shared by people I didn\u2019t know. I guess I get it, though, because that\u2019s something I would crack up at and share.\"\n\nKorie Mitchell/JessaCole Photography\n\nHumphrey is now working at Syracuse University in a faculty position doing disciplined-based education research. She will return to Florida State in December to walk at her graduation.", "description": "A Ph.D. student in Florida shared new photos of her", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/eve-humphrey-dissertation-newborn-photo-05-ht-jc-190910_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
