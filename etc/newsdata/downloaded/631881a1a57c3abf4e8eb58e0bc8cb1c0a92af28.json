The state's largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric or PG&E, is trying to prevent its wires from sparking wildfires, but that move is sparking anger.\n\nThe power outages began early Wednesday as California residents loaded up on essentials for what they say is a \"man-made disaster.\"\n\nPG&E has been forced to shut off electricity to customers because a forecast of high winds and bone dry heat is expected to put pressure on its aging and faulty infrastructure. It is a desperate attempt to avoid what happened in November when sparks from power lines ignited the fire that tore through the town of Paradise, killing 86.\n\nRon Blasingame lost his power at 2 a.m. and he could be in the dark for days.\n\n\"This is ridiculous! They are a public utility. How do they pass on their mistakes to us?\" he said.\n\nThe lasting damage of the worst wildfire in California's history\n\nUp to 34 California counties are experiencing a rolling blackout that began at midnight and will continue throughout the evening. By 6 p.m., more than 800,000 people will be off the grid.\n\nDermot Coll is keeping his bar open for a few more hours with a generator but anticipates losing a lot of money.\n\n\"I'm gonna tell you $30,000,\" he said.\n\nStanford economist Michael Wara estimates turning off the power could cost as much as $2.6 billion.\n\nThe economic impacts vary a lot, depending on who is blacked out, what kind of customer, whether it's a factory or supermarket or house.\n\nAt a hardware store in Sonoma, people have been waiting in line to be escorted by flashlight. It's not business as usual for a state confronted by a growing wildfire season. Winds are expected to be their strongest Thursday.", "description": "An economist says the Pacific Gas and Electric power cut to prevent wildfires could cost the region $2.6 billion in lost revenue", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/09/2b9fddbe-e983-4230-bc25-7811cafcf5db/thumbnail/1200x630/5d98d7cffd21abd9bc3718c52b2802bc/ap-19282657466317.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
