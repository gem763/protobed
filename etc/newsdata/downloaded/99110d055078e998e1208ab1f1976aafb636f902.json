But, he insisted that according to science, the results showed men were generally considered funnier.\n\nReasons he suggested for the disparity were societal and evolutionary.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that the view that women are less funny is so pervasive that societal forces discourage girls and women from developing and expressing their humor, making a woman less likely to be perceived as funny,\u201d Grengross said.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the evidence does suggest that humor plays a major role in mating, with a strong evolutionary basis,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cHumor is strongly correlated with intelligence, which explains why women value men with a great sense of humor, as intelligence was crucial for survival throughout our evolutionary history when we mostly lived in hunter-gatherer groups. Men, on the other hand, prefer women who laugh at their humor.\u201d\n\nBut comedians - and the general public - have objected to the study\u2019s findings.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Marina Bye - one half of comedy duo Siblings - said the study could put women off going into comedy.\n\n\"I really think it's unnecessary to do this study,\u201d Bye said. \u201cThey could've done something progressive.\"\n\n\"You want the worst and the best comedians to try because you never know. This study will cripple bravery.\u201d\n\nHer sister, Maddy, added that the study itself was \u201cfunny.\u201d\n\n\"There are so many amazing male and female comedy shows,\u201d she commented. \u201cI don't know why they're trying to make it a scientific fact that women aren't funny.\"\n\nScottish comedian Eleanor Morton also questioned the findings, especially the claim that women are less funny because they aren\u2019t searching for a mate.\n\n\u201cIt's just another boring 'study' that claims women don't NEED to be funny to find a mate so we're not. Nothing new,\u201d Morton tweeted.\n\n\u201cI actually think it's more likely and more interesting that many men actively seek out partners they don't think are funny because mummy told them they were the funniest little boy in the world and their ego couldn't stand being proved wrong,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this study ten times over the last decade; it\u2019s a waste of time and money.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's also f**king ignorant,\u201d agreed fellow comedian Sofie Hagen.\n\n\u201cThere's a difference between being good at writing jokes (a skill anyone can LEARN) and being funny (some people are, some people aren't). There are amazing joke-writers that aren't that funny and funny people who couldn't write a joke.\u201d\n\nReactions from the general public were equally sceptical.\n\n\u201cThe wildest part of that stupid new are women funny \u201cstudy\u201d is that I\u2019ve literally never met a funny man,\u201d one Twitter user wrote.\n\n\u201cCan we stop debating this, please?\u201d tweeted another. \u201cBeyond the derivative binary premise, it\u2019s still a totally subjective thing & the testing was even more so. Smart, funny women make the world go \u2018round.\u201d", "description": "Female comedians have hit back at a study that claims men are funnier than women.\u00a0 Researchers from Aberystwyth University and the University of North Carolina conducted a meta analysis of 28 studies which examined how funny around 5,000 people were.", "authors": ["Moya Lothian-Mclean"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/30/11/gettyimages-957537942.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
