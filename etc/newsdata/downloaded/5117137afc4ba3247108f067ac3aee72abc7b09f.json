Taiwan\n\nis China's most sensitive territorial issue.\n\n\"China is the only major country in the world that is yet to\n\nbe completely reunified,\" Wei said.\n\n\"Resolving the Taiwan question so as to realise China's full\n\nreunification is the irresistible trend of the times, China's\n\ngreatest national interest, the righteous path to follow and the\n\nlonging of all Chinese people.\"\n\nProudly democratic Taiwan has lambasted China for its\n\nauthoritarian rule and for being a threat to regional peace,\n\nwhile China has heaped pressure on Taiwan, whittling away at its\n\nfew remaining diplomatic allies.\n\nChina regards Taiwan as its sacred territory, to be brought\n\nunder Beijing's rule, by force if needed, a message President Xi\n\nJinping reiterated at the start of this year.\n\nChina translates the word \"tong yi\" as \"reunification\", but\n\nit can also be translated as \"unification\", a term in English\n\npreferred by supporters of Taiwan independence who point out\n\nthat Beijing's Communist government has never ruled Taiwan and\n\nso it cannot be \"reunified\".\n\nDefeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan in 1949 at the\n\nend of a civil war with the Communists. The People's Republic of\n\nChina has never governed Taiwan, whose people have shown little\n\ninterest in being ruled by autocratic Beijing.\n\nChina has also been angered by U.S. support for Taiwan,\n\nincluding arms sales. Washington has no formal ties with Taipei,\n\nbut is bound by law to provide the island with the means to\n\ndefend itself.\n\n\"No one and no force can ever stop China's full\n\nreunification. We are committed to promoting the peaceful\n\ndevelopment of cross-Taiwan strait relations and the peaceful\n\nreunification of the country,\" Wei said.\n\n\"However we will never allow separatists for Taiwan\n\nindependence to have their way, nor allow interference by any\n\nexternal forces. Advancing China's reunification is a just\n\ncause, while separatist activities are doomed to failure.\"\n\nFRICTION WITH THE U.S.\n\nThe U.S. and China have clashed across multiple fronts in\n\nrecent years, not only because of the bitter trade war but also\n\nbecause of efforts by Washington to check what it perceives as\n\ngrowing capabilities and aggressiveness of Beijing's armed\n\nforces in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nChina asserts territorial claims in almost all of the\n\nenergy-rich waters of the South China Sea, as do smaller\n\nneighbours Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and\n\nVietnam. But those countries are unable to keep pace with\n\nChina's military spending, which at nearly $170 billion this\n\nyear is second only to that of the U.S. Washington has spoken out against what it calls China's\n\n\"coercion\" of Southeast Asian neighbours, further adding to\n\ntensions.\n\nWei on Monday reiterated that Beijing is a \"peace-loving\n\nnation\" that would never strike first and does not pose a threat\n\nto the rest of the world.\n\n\"The China-U.S. military relationship is generally stable\n\nbut we are confronted with many difficulties and challenges,\" he\n\nsaid. \"Cooperation between the two militaries on strategic\n\ncommunication, mutual trust and risk control should be further\n\nstrengthened.\"\n\nThe U.S. has also angered China by repeatedly conducting\n\nwhat it calls \"freedom of navigation\" operations by ships close\n\nto islands China occupies in the South China Sea.\n\n\"The South China Sea islands and Diaoyu islands are\n\ninalienable parts of China's territory. We will not allow even\n\nan inch of territory that our ancestors have left to us to be\n\ntaken away,\" Wei said.\n\n\n\n($1 = 7.0682 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 2-China's defence minister says resolving 'Taiwan question' is national priority", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_2_800x533_L_1412601599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
