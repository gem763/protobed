Letters mailed to unsuspecting women are raising concerns", "language": "en", "text": "The Better Business Bureau is alerting consumers to \u201cbe critical\u201d of mail congratulating them on pregnancies and providing various gift cards and coupons to motherhood websites after connecting the letters \u2014 signed \u201cJenny B\u201d \u2014 to a company called Mothers Lounge.\n\nThousands of women across America and Canada have reported receiving the seemingly handwritten cards which offer congratulations on expecting a baby.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited for you. I hope you like these,\u201d the cards all read, with a signature from someone named Jenny B. But many of the recipients of the notes have taken to social media to share that they don\u2019t know who Jenny B is, and aren\u2019t even pregnant.\n\nSooo I come home to a letter written out to me with my address and everything and it\u2019s a pregnancy congratulatory card with $300 worth of gift cards. Plot twist. I\u2019m not pregnant \ud83e\udd14 \u2014 T. (@Tbabyyyy____) October 24, 2019\n\nJust received a card in the mail from Utah congratulating me on my pregnancy with over $300 dollars worth of gift cards..... 1) thank god my dad didn\u2019t open it 2) I\u2019m not pregnant 3) do I buy the pregnancy pillow anyways? \u2014 Amanda Gallo \u2655 (@amandagalloo) October 22, 2019\n\nMy parents received a card addressed to me at my parent\u2019s house, with no return address, with $245 worth of gift cards and coupons, congratulating me on my pregnancy. Jenny B. from Salt Lake City: who are you?! Do you have the wrong Roya Shariat?? I\u2019m not pregnant! pic.twitter.com/Mva7R7fXf2 \u2014 Roya Shariat (@royashariat) October 21, 2019\n\nKadie Humphreys, a 26-year-old mother-of-two from Florida, is one of the latest recipients of the letter after receiving it on Saturday. She tells Yahoo Lifestyle that since she\u2019s not expecting, she figured it might have been sent to her by mistake and took to Twitter to clarify.\n\nofficially the weirdest thing in the mail I\u2019ve ever received lol... I\u2019m not pregnant and idk you Jenny B.. if anyone wants these.. they are yours \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/wAOffu2NfB \u2014 Kadie Humphreys (@_kdp143) October 28, 2019\n\n\u201cThere is a community called \u2018mom twitter\u2019 where I assumed other moms may have received the same mailing, maybe one of them sent to me, or maybe they wanted the coupons,\u201d Humphreys writes via Twitter direct message. \u201cNobody I know has received it but some people replied to my tweet saying they saw an article posted on Facebook.\u201d\n\nAccording to the BBB\u2019s alert, it has been notified of identical letters and gift cards that it warns are being sent out from a Utah-based company, Mothers Lounge LLC., owned by a woman named Jeanette Pierce, who is likely \u201cJenny B.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo date, BBB serving Northern Nevada and Utah has found fifteen affiliate businesses, including Thoughtful Gift Cards and Canopy Couture. These gift cards are sent all over the U.S. and Canada in an envelope which appears to have lost its return label when it never had one in the first place,\u201d the BBB alert reads. \u201cThis is likely a marketing tactic meant to make the envelope look more like mail from a friend.\u201d\n\nConsumers have even complained that the $245 worth of gift cards provided in the mailing seem to only increase the shipping cost on orders that they\u2019ve attempted to complete on any of the affiliate sites, nearly to the same price as the card itself. The many complaints \u2014 which date back to February 2019 \u2014 have led the BBB to give the Mother\u2019s Lounge an F rating and even reach out to the company with concerns about their advertising practices.\n\n\u201cOn March 7th, we reviewed their advertising practices and reached out to them,\u201d Britta Clark, Director of Communications at the BBB Serving Northern Nevada and Utah, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cEven though we have not yet heard back from Mother's Lounge regarding BBB's concerns with their mailed advertising, we still hope the business will resolve the issue and answer the people that have complained about their marketing strategies.\u201d\n\nScott Anderson of the Mothers Lounge marketing team sent the following statement to Yahoo Lifestyle:", "description": "The Better Business Bureau is alerting consumers to \u201cbe critical\u201d of mail congratulating them on pregnancies and providing various gift cards from a woman named \"Jenny B.\"", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NuznPEjzfbE1RfoX7G7x.g--~B/aD03OTA7dz05MDg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/3cb1b850-f9ce-11e9-bcff-17f2dfe47764", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
