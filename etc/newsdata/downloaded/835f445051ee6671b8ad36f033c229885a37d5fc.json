Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was both applauded and chided earlier this year for using explicit language to lambaste President Donald Trump. Now, in the wake of the formal impeachment inquiry into the president, the freshman Democratic congresswoman is leaning into her infamous declaration.\n\nReferring to Trump, Tlaib had told supporters in January that \u201cwe\u2019re gonna impeach the motherfucker.\u201d On Thursday, she unveiled a range of merchandise inspired by those words.\n\n\u201cImpeach the MF,\u201d reads a new line of T-shirts being sold by Tlaib\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\n\u201cLean in with me to hold this lawless President accountable. Together, we will fight back and protect our democracy,\u201d Tlaib tweeted, adding: \u201cAnd yes you can even wear what you feel.\u201d\n\nLean in with me to hold this lawless President accountable.

Several supporters praised the design and vowed to buy one for themselves, but some critics found fault with the salty language and accused the congresswoman of not taking the impeachment process seriously.\n\nTlaib responded to the criticism on Friday.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is serious \u2015 I know this,\u201d she said on Twitter. \u201cBut it is a mistake to try to equate t-shirts with the destruction of our democracy or try to paint those who\u2019ve risked our safety calling for it, as not taking it seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of the t-shirts, focus on this President\u2019s criminal, impeachable behavior,\u201d Tlaib added in another tweet.\n\nIf there is anyone who takes impeachment seriously it is myself & the people I fight for everyday. Whether or not you agree with the expression, the t-shirts are to bring levity to my supporters. A senior in my district said, \u201cIt feels liberating.\u201d (2/4) \u2014 Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) September 27, 2019\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said last week that the House would begin formal impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The announcement followed a series of revelations related to a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nDuring the call, Trump pressed Zelensky to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, his potential opponent in the 2020 election. Trump has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.", "description": "The Democratic congresswoman made headlines earlier this year when she used the F-bomb to lambaste President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d907b352100003700fd65f3.jpeg?cache=uyx8xrugid&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
