The next day, Baker was unwilling to accept the recommendations for resolving the long-running dispute, which involved an apology to Smith. He resigned and, the attempt to mediate the dispute having failed, was soon after followed out the door by Ferguson.\n\nThe speed and finality of the resignations shocked the rest of the board, and leaves the body without much of its senior leadership weeks before Baker, a former China correspondent, had been scheduled to take six journalists to China on exchange. Other prominent initiatives from the club include the annual Quill awards, a new series of scholarships in the memory of The Age reporter Michael Gordon, and the Australian Media Hall of Fame.\n\nIt's not the first time tensions over the club have spilled into public view this year. In March, Crikey and The Guardian reported that the Commonwealth Bank had expressed an interest in sponsoring the Quills' Young Journalist of the Year award, in the process dislodging the long-standing arrangements the MPC had reached with the widow of journalist David Wilson to sponsor the same award in his memory.", "description": "A battle between two veterans of the Melbourne media scene has left the Melbourne Press Club without a president, vice-president and CEO.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2364%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_18/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/000491293c468635bc6affd7ec81a2e5d80bc78d", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
