For years, governments, courts and public authorities have been building a great wall to keep much of what they do a secret and using legislation to make it a criminal offence for media to tell you,\" Miller added.\n\nThe action follows June police raids on a News Corp journalist and on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\n\nOn June 4, the home of News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst was raided by police over a story revealing a proposal for an Australian electronic intelligence agency to take on an expanded role, something some government figures were concerned about, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nThen on June 5, as part of a separate investigation, the ABC's Sydney headquarters were raided over a series of articles covering accusations of war crimes committed by Australian special forces in Afghanistan. A planned June 6 raid of News Corp's offices did not go ahead.\n\n\"The police actions highlighted a perceived rise of cultural secrecy and legal restrictions that impinge on media freedom in Australia,\" wrote Sydney Morning Herald reporter Fergus Hunter on Monday.\n\nLisa Davies, editor of The Sydney Morning Herald, part of media group Nine, wrote: \"A web of laws covering freedom of information, whistle blower protection, national security, suppression and defamation have either been tightened or applied over-zealously to the point where Australians are not being properly informed about important matters of national interest.\"\n\nThe blacked-out front pages are part of a campaign by the Right to Know Coalition, and was supported by TV, radio and online outlets.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison defended police raids as an agency doing its job to protect national security, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. However, the Australian Federal Police have launched an inquiry into how it handles sensitive investigations by the media.", "description": "Rival newspapers in Australia have blacked out the text on their front pages in a co-ordinated protest against press restrictions.
