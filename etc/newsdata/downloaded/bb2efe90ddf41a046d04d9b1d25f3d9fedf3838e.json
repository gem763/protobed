The pledge was created for youth to assert their intent to not have children unless urgent and serious action is taken against the climate crisis.

She still has a list of baby names on her computer, she said.\n\nListen to Emma Lim's interview on Daybreak here: A Montreal climate activist named Emma Lim has started a new pledge called: #NoFutureNoChildren... it has 291 people who have signed the pledge... which says \"I pledge not to have children until I am sure my government will ensure a safe future for them\" The campaign kicked off Monday -- on Parliament Hill. 8:30\n\nGiving up that dream is not easy, she said, and she worries that, despite her best efforts, nothing will change.\n\nThe patriotism she felt as a child \u2014 the belief that her government can do anything \u2014 is fading, she said.\n\n\"It's clear that our leaders aren't taking this seriously and this is a serious issue,\" she said, citing the federal government's approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion on the heels of proclaiming a climate crisis.\n\nEmma Lim, centre, with her mother Catherine Cartman, left, and her friend Sophie Price. (Submitted by Emma Lim)\n\nAs it is, Canada is not on track to meeting the Paris Agreement goals, she said. Were the country to take the necessary steps to meet those goals, she said she may one day consider having kids, but everyone who pledges has a different objective.\n\nHer aim is to look to the future with hope instead of fear, she said.\n\nWaiting until the government takes action before having kids is an \"alien concept\" for her parents and grandparents, Lim said, but she's getting support back home.\n\nMother supports daughter\n\nLim's mother, Catherine Cartman, went to Ottawa to support her daughter.\n\n\"It's a parent's role to support their children,\" she said, and she hopes it will inspire change.\n\nCartman, a mother of three, said she wants Lim and \"youth everywhere to feel safe to have children.\"\n\nWhile she would like Lim to have children someday, she said, were the world to fall into complete disarray because of a climate crisis, \"who can blame her for not having children? \"\n\n\"It would be selfish on my part to encourage her to have children under those circumstances.\"", "description": "An 18-year-old McGill University student pledges to not have children until she is sure her government is taking serious steps to battle climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5286789.1568737954!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/emma-lim.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
