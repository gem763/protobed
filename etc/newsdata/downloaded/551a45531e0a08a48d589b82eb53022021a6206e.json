CBO's preliminary estimate is based on daily Treasury reports.\n\nDuring the election campaign in 2016, Trump repeatedly pledged to start cutting the size of the deficit when he became president, at one point suggesting that he could eliminate it entirely in eight years.\n\nHowever, tax laws Trump championed in 2017 when limited the amount of revenue the government could collect, combined with spending pledges that breached agreed limits in the 2018 budget deal, have combined to entrench the problem.", "description": "The Congressional Budget Office revealed the US deficit grew by $200million in 2019 to a total of $984billion, meaning it grew faster than the economy for the fourth straight year.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/11/19436678-0-image-a-15_1570529266733.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
