And the D.C. U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office has scrutinized allegations that McCabe was not candid with FBI investigators about his role in a news story concerning the FBI\u2019s probe into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nNow, emails reviewed by The Daily Beast cast additional light on the circumstances that preceded McCabe\u2019s firing from the FBI. They show that one FBI official felt the need to clarify to then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that the FBI\u2019s internal investigation into McCabe\u2019s behavior wasn\u2019t being slow-walked. And they show that former director of national intelligence James Clapper urged FBI Director Chris Wray to shield McCabe from being fired. They also show that in the weeks before the 2016 presidential election, McCabe shared more information about his media contacts with then-FBI Director James Comey than was previously known.\n\nMcCabe has sued the Justice Department over his firing. The issues these emails shed light on\u2014whether he deserved to be fired and whether the FBI handled the decision correctly\u2014are sure to be front and center if the lawsuit goes to trial.\n\nThe Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a government watchdog group, obtained the emails through FOIA litigation and shared them with The Daily Beast. They are also available in the FBI\u2019s FOIA vault. CREW\u2019s litigation is ongoing.\n\nSome of the emails in the tranche cast light on the FBI\u2019s scramble to deal with media coverage in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign. On Oct. 21, 2016, McCabe sent Comey an email with the subject line \u201cUpdates.\u201d Copied on the email were James Rybicki, who was then Comey\u2019s chief of staff, and David Bowdich, who was then associate deputy director of the FBI. McCabe opened with an update on a cyberattack. He then turned to the subject of media.\n\n\u201cIn the more bad news category, Mike K informed me that Devlin Barrett at WSJ is putting together an article claiming I had a conflict of interest on MYR as a result of Jill\u2019s campaign connections to Gov. McCaulife [sic],\u201d McCabe wrote, referring to then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. \u201cI will work with mike to provide some basic facts to push back. And, as always, will keep you advised. I am incredibly sorry for adding to the drama on this.\u201d\n\n\u201cMike K\u201d referred to Mike Kortan, then the FBI\u2019s public affairs chief. \u201cMYR\u201d referred to Midyear, the FBI\u2019s nickname for its investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.\n\n\u201cOutstanding,\u201d Comey replied to McCabe. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, McCabe updated Comey and Rybicki on his participation in the then-forthcoming Wall Street Journal story.\n\n\u201c The only additional notable news is that Mike K and I spent a good part of the day trying to shape the WSJ story on my alleged conflict. \u201d \u2014 Email from Andrew McCabe\n\n\u201cNot too much in the update,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe only additional notable news is that Mike K and I spent a good part of the day trying to shape the WSJ story on my alleged conflict,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLooks like they may try to release it on line tonight. The reporter also called Jill for a comment, so we are working that as well.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department Inspector General did not mention the emails in his damning report on McCabe, which focused on his role in a second Wall Street Journal story. The report alleged that McCabe lacked candor when he told FBI investigators about how the Journal obtained information about the Bureau\u2019s internal deliberations for that second story.\n\nOne issue has been whether McCabe told Comey about his participation in that story; McCabe has said he did, but Comey has said he has no recollection of McCabe making the disclosure to him. McCabe\u2019s lawyers, meanwhile, argue that the Inspector General\u2019s report is seriously flawed.\n\nScrutiny of McCabe\u2019s work at the FBI grew over the following two years, with congressional Republicans and the president calling for McCabe to be fired and punished. But McCabe also had defenders. Clapper\u2014who has also become a target of the president\u2014sent a handwritten letter to FBI Director Chris Wray on Feb. 25, 2018, praising McCabe and calling for Wray to intercede on his behalf. That letter is in the tranche of documents CREW obtained. In it, Clapper called the criticism of McCabe \u201ccompletely unjustified and profoundly unfair.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe often appeared as witnesses together at Congressional hearings, where, as you also know, \u2018bonds\u2019 with fellow witnesses can quickly form,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI came to know and rely on Andy as steady, straightforward, candid, forthright, and honest.\u201d\n\nHe also praised McCabe for his \u201csharp intellect, insightful wisdom, unwavering commitment to the mission, self-effacing humility, staunch devotion to the men and women of the Bureau, and, importantly, his impeccable integrity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hope you will consider my observations, which I know are shared uniformly by virtually everyone who knows Andy, and will use your influential voice to insure he is able to complete his career and retire after his 21 years of distinguished service to the Bureau and this nation,\u201d Clapper concluded.\n\nClapper\u2019s letter came as the FBI\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) was scrutinizing McCabe. The Inspector General had referred his case to OPR so they could make a recommendation to the Attorney General on how to handle it. In an email sent on March 5, 2018, Candice Will\u2014then the head of the OPR office\u2014updated Bowdich on her team\u2019s review of the McCabe investigation. That note includes a line that seems to hint at outside pressure to speed it up.\n\n\u201cI sent the DAG [Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein] a short email advising that FBI OPR had received the referral from the OIG, we are actively working it, we anticipate providing a proposed action to the subject this week, we will make the file available to the subject\u2014all in accordance with standard procedures\u2014for him to prepare a written response,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn doing so, I let the Dept know that we are doing what should be done, not slow walking\u2014we are following established procedures.\u201d\n\nBowdich responded by noting that the Bureau would face criticism regardless of how it handled the decision on McCabe.\n\n\u201cThanks Candice, as you know we will be second guessed by some every step of the way however this ends up,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs long as we follow the regular process we are where we should be on this issue.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear why Will felt the need to clarify to Rosenstein that her office was \u201cnot slow walking\u201d the McCabe review. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment for this story, as did a spokesperson for McCabe.\n\nOn March 19, 2018, just hours before McCabe would have been eligible to retire and receive his pension, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced his firing. The move horrified his allies, but cheered critics of the Russia probe. And Trump\u2019s personal lawyer at the time, John Dowd, praised the move and said Mueller\u2019s investigation should be shut down next.\n\nThe timing of McCabe\u2019s firing\u2014and the question of whether Trump\u2019s allies pushed for it to be expedited\u2014has become a major point of contention.\n\nThe emails suggest there may be more to all these pieces of the McCabe story than currently known\u2014and that civil litigation or a criminal trial could generate much more information.", "description": "The messages shared with The Daily Beast cast additional light on the circumstances that preceded McCabe\u2019s firing from the FBI.", "authors": ["Betsy Woodruff", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568006279/190909-woodruff-andrew-mccabe-james-comey-hero_is3c2i", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
