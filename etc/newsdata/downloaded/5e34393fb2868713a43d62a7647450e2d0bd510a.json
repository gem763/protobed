It added that the commissioner would accept that the pain \u201cdoes not diminish over time\u201d and extend her sympathy to the descendants of those killed.\n\n'He's a barbarian': M\u0101ori tribe bans replica of Captain Cook's ship from port Read more\n\nWhen the British explorer arrived on the east side of the T\u016branganui River, near present-day Gisborne, the first encounter between his men and the M\u0101ori inhabitants of the land was disastrous, according to an official New Zealand history site, with a leader from the Ng\u0101ti Oneone group immediately shot and killed. It seemed likely the local people were undertaking a ceremonial challenge, which the Europeans misunderstood, the site said.\n\nAt least eight other M\u0101ori are believed to have been killed. The British high commission said in its statement that Cook had written of his regret over the deaths in his diary.\n\nThe high commission said Clarke\u2019s statement had come at the request of the iwi, and that officials had liaised with the groups Clarke will meet \u201cfor many months\u201d in preparation.\n\nJust a small handful of official statements have been made by the UK government about its actions overseas during the colonial period. In 2013, it expressed regret and announced compensation payments for those tortured in prison during Kenya\u2019s Mau Mau insurgency.\n\nAnd earlier this year, on the 100th anniversary of the Amritsar massacre in India, in which British troops fired on crowds, killing 379 according to official figures, the government expressed \u201cdeep regret\u201d \u2013 but again stopped short of an official apology.\n\nThe statement in New Zealand will be made privately during meetings at marae, or M\u0101ori meeting houses, visited by a British delegation. The exact contents of the statement will not be made public or put in writing, the high commission said, unless the iwi Clarke will speak to wish to do so themselves.\n\nClarke was appointed to Wellington in January 2018, and has since spoken admiringly of the push towards \u201crighting past wrongs\u201d in the treatment of M\u0101ori by New Zealand governments and the UK.\n\nShe is learning te reo M\u0101ori, and last year the high commission recruited its first advisor on M\u0101ori affairs.\n\nMeng Foon, New Zealand\u2019s race relations commissioner and a former mayor of Gisborne, told Radio New Zealand that the British statement was \u201csignificant\u201d and he hoped it would help iwi move forward.\n\nBut Tina Ngata, a M\u0101ori rights advocate who has been leading the opposition to the commemorations of Cook\u2019s arrival, said words weren\u2019t enough without change.\n\nLast month, she told radio NZ that Cook was \u201ca murderer, he was an invader [and] he was a vanguard for British imperial expansion.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, will visit Gisborne on the weekend for the official commemorations, but will not participate in Wednesday\u2019s expression of regret.", "description": "Statement from high commissioner Laura Clarke comes ahead of 250th anniversary of Cook\u2019s landing, but stops short of apology", "authors": ["Charlotte Graham-Mclay In Wellington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a3467da3ed37d1a6f1fae2f4c875feba23f9045/0_143_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=86f70cab8e594431798f71f4ebea0f86", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
