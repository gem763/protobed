Over half of the 2,000 complaints investigated annually by the Canadian Forces ombudsman have an 'end of career' context, he says. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nA Federal Court judge recently said the complaint review was handled unfairly and ordered DND to take another look at it.\n\nWhile the review was going on, the ombudsman's office was stripped of some of its financial and human resources authority, according to Federal Court records.\n\nWalbourne also was unable to arrange a meeting with Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan or get his phone calls to the minister returned \u2014 the aftermath of a mysterious, private falling-out between Walbourne and Sajjan.\n\nThe dispute raged on for more than a year until Walbourne's early retirement.\n\nDuring that time, the progress of existing cases and the prospective opening of new ones almost ground to a halt, the court documents suggest.\n\nA spokesman for the current ombudsman, Gregory Lick, said Thursday that, because of privacy considerations, he was unable to say how many complaints may have gone dark during that time.\n\n\"Our office cannot comment on cases pertaining to individual complainants we investigated or sought resolution to during that time period,\" said Andrew Bernardo, the ombudsman's director of communications.\n\nAccording to the documents provided by Mason's family, the exchange of letters between her, DND and the ombudsman virtually dried up between early 2017 and the spring of 2018 \u2014 precisely when the office became engulfed in turmoil.\n\nAn online database of letters exchanged between the ombudsman office and the minister shows several letters written by Walbourne to both the minister and the chief of the defence staff went unanswered in the spring and summer of 2018.\n\nWrote to apologize\n\nDuring that time period, Walbourne wrote to Mason personally to effectively apologize for not being able to get results.\n\n\"We have urged the minister to use his discretion to correct this unfairness, and to date we have not been successful in prompting a resolution of your case,\" Walbourne wrote on May 4, 2018, at the height of his dispute with the minister's office.\n\nMason, 77, was the widow of retired sergeant Thomas \"Bill\" Mason. She was denied a survivor's benefit after his 2014 death under a federal policy that prohibits a spouse from collecting a pension benefit if they marry a former military member who is 60 years old or older.\n\nIt is known within the federal bureaucracy as the \"gold diggers clause\" and it was something the Liberal government promised to address during the 2015 federal election. In the last spring's federal budget, the Liberals promised a $150 million fund to address the issue.\n\nIt came too late for Mason. Spencer said that, in light of the Walbourne case, the long silence over his mother's claim now makes sense.\n\nDisappointed by bureaucracy\n\n\"I'm disappointed,\" said Spencer. \"I'm disappointed by the bureaucracy and in-fighting took away my mum's right to a survivor's benefit. We were not talking millions of dollars here.\"\n\nThe foundation of Mason's complaint was that the Department of National Defence initially stated in writing that she was entitled to the survivor's benefit, but then reneged. Officials appear to have adjusted the criteria without notifying the family.\n\n\"The ombudsman was very sympathetic and quite shocked that the case was being held up,\" said Spencer, who acted as his mother's sounding board.\n\n\"The whole time we were just being patient and I just said, 'Mum, this is bureaucracy at its finest but we're gonna win this.' And she kept saying, 'I think they're waiting for me to die and they won't have to pay me.'\"\n\nMason died on Dec. 31, 2018 in Kelowna, B.C. after a short illness.\n\nOmbudsman offered condolences\n\nThe man who replaced Walbourne as ombudsman, Gregory Lick, penned a handwritten note to the family expressing condolences and regret that she passed away without \"closure\" in her case.\n\n\"My office remains committed to helping bring resolution to this issue and we are continuing to directly engage with the minister's office in this light,\" said the Jan. 18, 2019 letter.\n\nSpencer said he has not heard from the government since. He said the issue for him is not the money, but rather the indignity his mother faced.\n\nA spokesman for the defence department declined comment.\n\nMinister's office looking at case\n\n\"We are aware of this case and are looking into it further,\" said Dan Lebouthillier. \"Due to privacy considerations, we cannot disclose details of individual cases.\"\n\nEarlier this week, CBC News reported on the circumstances surrounding Walbourne's departure and the restrictions placed on his office.\n\nVeterans advocate Barry Westholm said he had tried to convince the ombudsman to take up an investigation into the tragic death of Pte. Leah Green, who took her own life after leaving the military suffering chronic pain from a spinal cord injury.\n\nHe said he got nowhere at the time \u2014 and he now understands why.\n\n\"At this meeting Mr. Walbourne stated while he agreed with this, that there was immense pressure on his office and that any new internal (to the Ombudsman's Office) investigations would be met with much resistance,\" said Westholm.", "description": "The turmoil between the defence department and former military ombudsman Gary Walbourne took a tragic turn for one British Columbia family.
