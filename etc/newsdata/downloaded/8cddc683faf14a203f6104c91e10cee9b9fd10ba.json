Oh, and one croissant, thanks! (Illustration: Olivier Coipel)\n\nNever mess with Scarlet Witch. If things go bad, and she gets upset enough, she could always, y\u2019know, erase you from reality.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to the entirety of mutantkind in one of Marvel\u2019s biggest, most controversial crossover events, 2005's House of M.
