I pay tribute to those who have campaigned so passionately and tirelessly on this issue \u2013 your efforts have made all the difference.\u201d\n\nAnd Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 who has set out plans for a state-owned generic drugs manufacturer to force companies like Vertex to lower prices \u2013 said: \u201cThis is life-changing for everyone with cystic fibrosis in our country. They\u2019ve waited years for this drug. A victory for all the campaigners who have taken on big pharmaceutical companies\u2019 greed and government inaction. When we stand together and take on the powerful, we win.\u201d\n\nMeindert Boysen, director of NIce\u2019s Centre for Health Technology Evaluation said: \u201cWe are pleased an agreement has been reached between NHS England and Vertex that brings these medicines to patients. It is also welcome that the company will now re-engage with the Nice process.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with the company and patient organisations to get ready for the appraisals, including developing the approach to the collection of evidence.\u201d\n\nVertex senior vice-president Ludovic Fenaux said: \u201cToday is a significant day for the cystic fibrosis community in England. This important agreement, reached in collaboration and partnership with NHS England and Nice, will allow more than 5,000 eligible cystic fibrosis patients in England to have access to CFTR modulators to treat the underlying cause of their disease.\u201d\n\nDr Caroline Elston, chair of the UK Cystic Fibrosis Medical Association, said: \u201cWe welcome this amazing progress in England, and look forward to receiving further details on how this will be rolled out by NHS England, and what this means for people with CF in Northern Ireland and Wales.\u201d", "description": "NHS clinicians are to begin prescribing life-saving cystic fibrosis drugs to patients in England within the next 30 days, after a four-year\u00a0campaign concluded with an agreement to provide them to the health service on an affordable basis.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/15/istock-174781798.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
