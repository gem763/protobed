Renewed anti-government protests across Iraq left more than 40 people dead on Friday through tear gas, live rounds and fires, a watchdog and security sources told AFP.\n\nThe protests represent a second phase of a week-long movement in early October that ended with more than 150 people dead.\n\nRallies had been set to resume on Friday, with a range of actors from Iraq's highest Shiite authority to the United Nations urging restraint.\n\nThey began early and calm on Thursday evening, with protesters exchanging flowers with security forces and the interior minister insisting police would \"protect\" protesters.\n\nBut by Friday evening, demonstrations across the country had descended into violence that left 42 protesters dead -- at least half of them as they attacked the headquarters of armed factions or government bodies.\n\nTwelve died in the southern city of Diwaniyah alone, while setting fire to the headquarters of the powerful Badr organisation, part of the Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force, security sources told AFP.\n\nAnother 30 came in a toll compiled by the Iraqi Human Rights Commission, which did not include the Diwaniyah dead.\n\nThe national rights watchdog said the 30 were killed by gunshots or tear gas canisters in the capital and four southern provinces.\n\nSeveral died while trying to storm the offices of Asaib Ahl al-Haq, another armed faction, in two southern cities.\n\nParliament is scheduled to meet on Saturday to discuss the protests further.\n\n- UN slams 'violations' -\n\nSecurity forces imposed a curfew across several southern provinces late Friday.\n\nAmong them was Basra, which was swept up in its own wave of protests last year over moribund public services, with outraged citizens also burning government and party offices.\n\nSimilar grievances sparked this month's protests: one in five Iraqis still lives in poverty and youth unemployment sits around 25 percent, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe country ranks as OPEC's second-biggest oil producer -- and the 12th most corrupt nation in the world, according to Transparency International.\n\nBut protesters said this year's demonstrations were unprecedented because of their independence and the violence with which they were met.\n\nAt least 157 people were killed in the first few days of October, according to a government probe, a vast majority of them protesters in Baghdad.\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Friday said the deaths were the result of \"substantial\" rights violations.\n\n\"We deeply regret the number, the large number of people that have been killed in these circumstances,\" he said.\n\nActivists had urged Iraqis to return to the streets on Friday to mark a year since Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi came to power.\n\nIt was also the deadline set out by Iraq's top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, for Abdel Mahdi to respond to demonstrators' demands.\n\nIn a much-awaited sermon on Friday, Sistani's representative urged protesters and security forces to show \"restraint,\" warning of \"chaos\" if violence broke out again.\n\nHis sermon appeared to echo the package of reforms put forward by Abdel Mahdi, including an anti-corruption campaign, a job creation drive and improved social welfare.\n\n- 'All liars' -\n\nBut demonstrators sounded unconvinced.\n\n\"Adel Abdel Mahdi is lying to us,\" protesters shouted in Baghdad, just hours after the premier's televised appearance in which he defended his reform agenda.\n\n\"They are all liars -- they lie when they promise us jobs and when we protest, they fire tear gas at us!\" shouted another.\n\nThousands massed Friday outside Baghdad's Green Zone, which hosts government offices and foreign embassies, but security forces used a volley of tear gas to push them back.\n\nThe enclave had been opened to the public for several months under Abdel Mahdi in response to the improving security situation across the country.\n\nBut security was beefed up again when protesters began gathering earlier this month at Baghdad's iconic Tahrir (Liberation) Square, which lies across a key bridge from the Green Zone.\n\nIn 2016, supporters of firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr breached the area in response to his calls to hit the streets.\n\nSadr, an influential ex-militiaman who controls the largest parliamentary bloc, has thrown his weight behind the recent protests.", "description": "Renewed anti-government protests across Iraq left more than 40 people dead on Friday through tear gas, live rounds and fires, a watchdog and security sources told AFP.
