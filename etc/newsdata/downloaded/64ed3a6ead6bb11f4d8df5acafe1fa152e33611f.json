But that did come at a cost, though, thanks to a double strike by returning captain Dane Piedt (2/8) after he dismissed both openers to leave the Eastern Cape side on 32 for two.\n\nBoth sides now face hard work to try and generate a result on the final day of the round four fixture on Thursday.\n\nHowever, whatever happens home coach Ashwell Prince is likely to be satisfied, especially after his side batted so well to recover from 73 for four to eventually bat for more than 140 overs.\n\nThey started the third day on 154 for four, with Jason Smith first to fall after failing to add to his overnight 41. Glenton Stuurman was the bowler and the dismissal of the all-rounder was one of five strikes amongst figures of five for 72 \u2013 his 12th career five-for and best at franchise level.\n\nMatthew Kleinveldt at the other end, though, did manage to move from his day two score of 70 to 92 (215 balls, 16 fours), before he fell to Lutho Sipamla (2/57).\n\nAn outstanding 102-run seventh wicket stand then followed between Linde and rookie Thando Ntini, who went on to post his personal best score of 40.\n\nThat propelled the Cobras to a slight lead, and they drove home the advantage when Piedt, back again from national duty in India, got rid of Eddie Moore (21) and Matthew Breetzke (5) in the final half-hour of play.", "description": "A maiden franchise century by new Proteas spinner George Linde helped Cape Cobras deliver a powerful response in their 4-Day Franchise Series clash against the Warriors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9486/d650b92f01f34e1793144a49eb2aadd6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
