Kim ordered the $100,000 to go to a fund held by the students\u2019 lawyers to help the more than 16,000 borrowers who she said suffered damages from the violation. Both sides must submit a plan for administering the fund by Nov. 15.\n\nThe judge\u2019s rebuke comes hours after DeVos\u2019s point person on overhauling the student loan system abruptly resigned and publicly called for mass debt forgiveness.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that defendants violated the\u201d court order, Kim wrote in her ruling. She said the violation hurt individual borrowers.\n\nThe language the judge used in her written order Thursday was more reserved than what she said in court earlier this month. At an Oct. 7 hearing, Kim said she was \u201castounded\u201d by the agency\u2019s conduct, saying it was \u201cgross negligence,\u201d at best, and \u201can intentional flouting\u201d of her order, at worst.\n\nThe Education Department didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cThe contempt finding and sanctions here are appropriate and well-deserved,\u201d said Eileen Connor, a lawyer for the students. \u201cThe department and its leaders need to do better by students.\u201dCorinthian, once among the largest for-profit college chains in the country, faced a flood of government investigations and lawsuits alleging systemic fraud before filing for bankruptcy protection from creditors in 2015.\n\nIn the aftermath, the federal government declared that as many as 335,000 former students could erase their loans by checking a box and signing their names on a simple form, under penalty of perjury. Doing so, the former students were told, would void their debt and prompt a refund on past payments.\n\nIn 2017, a group of former Corinthian students sued the Education Department and DeVos claiming the government stopped granting the loan discharges. The case was brought as a class action on behalf of about 80,000 students.\n\nA report the department filed last month to show its compliance with the judge\u2019s order to cease debt collections instead explained that the agency has seized tax refunds and wages from at least 1,808 students.\n\nThe cases are Manriquez v. DeVos, 17-cv-07210, and California v. U.S. Department of Education, 17-cv-07106, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).\n\n(Adds comment from students\u2019 lawyer)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Joel Rosenblatt in San Francisco at jrosenblatt@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Glovin at dglovin@bloomberg.net, Joe Schneider, Peter Blumberg\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos was hit with a $100,000 fine for violating a judge\u2019s order to stop debt collection efforts against former students at bankrupt Corinthian Colleges Inc.Despite the order, the department went as far as seizing the students\u2019 tax refunds and wages.U.S", "authors": ["Joel Rosenblatt"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cklxlDoN6ByNBoXdd3RW9w--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/975b8949a3c2747d7263b399ffab1033", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
