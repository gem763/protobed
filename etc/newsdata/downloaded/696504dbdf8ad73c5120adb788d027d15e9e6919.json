No need to really read the \"reasons\" given by the govt for disqualifying a candidate in details, it is just wrong to vet candidates according to their political beliefs. Those \"reasons\" will always be arbitrary excuses to ban anyone they dislike. \u2014 LO Kin-hei \u7f85\u5065\u7199 (@lokinhei) October 29, 2019\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, chief executive Carrie Lam ruled out any concessions to the protesters - referring to them as rioters - despite acknowledging the serious impact the unrest had had on Hong Kong's economy.\n\n\"For the government to resort to measures that will appease the violent rioters, I don't think that is the solution,\" she told reporters at a weekly press conference.\n\nThe city's tourism and retail industries were both suffering as a result of the continued demonstrations, she admitted.\n\nThe territory's financial secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that Hong Kong was in recession and the blow to the economy had been 'comprehensive'.\n\nLam also dismissed reports that China planned to replace her in office by March next year as \"rumours\".", "description": "Democracy activist shares official letter on social media with his candidacy ruled 'invalid'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/cdaeebd0f5bc4f01a9111e9f817ec68e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
