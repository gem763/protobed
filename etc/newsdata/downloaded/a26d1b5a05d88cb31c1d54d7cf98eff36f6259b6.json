So I said, \"Let's do something different for Halloween. Instead of something scary, let's do something funny\". We came up with this,\" she said.\n\nSoberano said that it took Gil a while before agreeing to the idea as he was shy about wearing the dress.\n\n\"It's Halloween, we can do whatever we want and make it fun,\" the actress added.\n\nGil chimed in, saying that he has a new-found respect for women after trying to walk in a pair of high heels to complete the look.\n\n\"It kinda looks good on me tonight,\" the actor said.\n\nThe actor also recently posted a video on Instagram of the two of them in another \"White Chicks\" getup, dancing to Run DMC's \"It's Tricky\".\n\n(Photo Source: Push Instagram)", "description": "Liza Soberano says she wanted something funny for Black Magic", "authors": ["Heidi Hsia"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ymaUA0bM8ogH27g9sWLeZA--~B/aD03Njg7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_hive_asia_947/20ecb7547db1be14c3ed4b5eb08eefe1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
