Ray Massey has been to Monaco to make sure he's one of the first to get his hands on Bentley's new luxurious limousine\n\nThe high barrier to ownership is a shame, because having road-tested the new 207mph luxury four-door sports saloon \u2013 both behind the wheel and in the exclusive chauffeur-driven rear - I reckon I could get used to it very quickly.\n\nWealth, I always feel, is wasted on the rich. But the principality of Monaco, along with Cannes and Nice in neighbouring France, is just the sort of setting where the flagship Flying Spur looks and feels perhaps most at home \u2013 among the rich, famous, fashionable, F1 drivers, tax exiles and, dare one say, international criminals, who have the wherewithal to afford one to go alongside the world\u2019s most expensive super-yachts in the harbour.\n\nEven here it proved an instant head-turner. Fittingly so, as Monte Carlo and the Cote d\u2019Azur is intimately associated with the elegance and glamour of the late Princess Grace, formerly the actress Grace Kelly.\n\nSo here was my chance to emulate her suave co-star Cary Grant from the 1955 romantic thriller movie \u2018To Catch a Thief\u2019 set in the French Riviera and Monte Carlo.\n\nOnce behind the wheel and ensconced in the wonderfully supportive and comfortable leather seats, I glided out in my Flying Spur from the main casino square and onwards to my adventure \u2013 Monte Carlo or Bust.\n\nFor such a large car it handles beautifully even in the narrowest and twistiest lanes of Monaco, so should be a doddle in London, Glasgow, New York and Beijing.\n\nRay Massey pictured with the new Flying Spur outside the famous casino next to the elegant Hotel de Paris\n\nThe iconic British manufacturer chose the affluent location for the global launch of first drives of the new limo\n\nBentley Boy: Ray Massey casts his eye over the famous winged emblem adorned on the bonnet\n\nBut I was heading - via Grasse which is famous as a world centre for perfume and with a short detour to Mougins where Spanish artist Picasso latterly lived and died \u2013 to the Route Napoleon and the wonderfully serpentine mountain roads of the Alpes-Maritime.\n\nOut on the open road, the Flying Spur\u2019s performance is more sports car than limousine with phenomenal power and acceleration that combines spirited grand touring with modern limousine levels of comfort, luxury and refinement.\n\nPowered by a mighty 6.0 twin-turbo-charged W12 TSI petrol engine developing 635 horse-power - equivalent to six Ford Fiestas - and linked to a dual clutch eight-speed automatic gear-box the new third generation Flying Spur accelerates its two and a half tonne mass smoothly but exceptionally energetically from rest to 60mph in just 3.8 seconds. Exhilarating. And all rather exciting.\n\nAt low loads and strain it can reduce to just six-cylinders to save fuel and emissions.\n\nIt is also precise and nimble tackling tight corners with sharp gearshifts \u2013 both in automatic and with manual paddle over-ride.\n\nThat\u2019s also because this is first Bentley to feature electronic all wheel steering. So all four wheels move independently to maximise agility both at slow speeds around town and allow faster highway driving.\n\nThe new third generation Flying Spur accelerates its two and a half tonne mass smoothly but exceptionally energetically from rest to 60mph in just 3.8 seconds\n\nAt low loads and strain it can reduce to just 6-cylinders to save fuel and emissions\n\nDuring low-speed driving, the rear wheels steer in the opposite direction to the front wheels. This has the effect of shortening the wheelbase, reducing the turning circle, increasing agility and making parking noticeably easier.\n\nBy contrast during high-speed manoeuvres, the rear wheels steer in the same direction as the front wheels, increasing stability and allowing for more confident overtaking and lane-changing.\n\nThat sense of sure-footedness is accentuated thanks to active all-wheel drive which moves power between the wheels as needed.\n\nIt feels balanced and lighter than the scales suggest, and with very precise steering. This is helped by Bentley\u2019s electronic dynamic ride which uses a 48-volt system to manage the stiffness of the anti-roll bar to combat cornering forces and keep the car level.\n\nTo ensure plenty of stopping power it also shares the largest iron brakes in the world with the Continental GT.\n\nNew three-chamber air springs allow the driver to adjust suspension on a range between limousine-style ride comfort and sporting levels of body control.\n\nSounds good too, thanks to an exhaust-pipe control valve which is tuned to provide a more discreet exhaust note inside the cabin for chauffeur-driven occupants.\n\nDuring low-speed manoeuvres, the rear wheels steer in the opposite direction to the front wheels. This has the effect of shortening the wheelbase so it turns quicker\n\nThat said, the wheelbase is 130mm longer than its predecessor. This is to give the new car more interior cabin space and increased road presence\n\nA wheelbase 130mm longer than its predecessor also gives the new car more interior cabin space and increased road presence, with a long list of single and dual veneer wood options.\n\nThe car I drove first - riding on 21-inch wheels in a sporty \u2018Verdant\u2019 dark metallic green exterior and with a club-like Cumbrian Green leather interior - made me feel like a true modern-day \u2018Bentley Boy\u2019 from the firm\u2019s racing heritage of the 1920s.\n\nIt had additional features that whacked up the base \u00a3168,300 starting price by \u00a337,125 \u2013 enough to buy a very decent executive saloon or SUV \u2013 taking the total to a hefty \u00a3205,425.\n\nThis included \u2018Blackline\u2019 exterior trim which replaced exterior chrome with black gloss detailing, including on the Flying B mascot, front grille, door handles and exhaust. It alone adds \u00a33,500 to the base price.\n\nThe bespoke \u2018Mulliner\u2019 interior spec (with sports pedals, leather headliner, diamond quilting on seats, and 3-D leather door panels) added \u00a39,535, while and \u2018Touring\u2019 spec ( with adaptive cruise control, lane-assist, night-vision, head-up display and added safety features) added \u00a36,290.\n\nBlackline trim is expected to account for around a third of orders as Bentley wants to stamp its authority on the luxury sports saloon market before the arrival next year of the new Rolls-Royce Ghost.\n\nBentley Flying Spur: Will it fit in my garage? Price: from \u00a3168,300 On sale: Now First deliveries: February 2020 Length: 5304mm Width: 1964mm Height: 1488mm Wheelbase: 1231mm Weight: 2235kg Engine: 6.0-litre twin-turbo-charged W12 TSI Power: 635 horse-power (PS) / 626bhp Gears: dual clutch 8-speed automatic Top speed: 207mph 0-60mph: 3.7 seconds 0-62mph (100kph): 3.8 second Fuel economy: 19.1mpg CO2 emissions: 337g/km Range: 500 miles Wheels: 21 inch standard/ two 22-inch optional Mulliner specifications\n\nIt also came as a \u00a34,770 extra, with the Toblerone-style rotating centre console (first shown on the Continental GT) which has three faces: a 12.3 inch digital touchscreen; three circular analogue dials (showing outside temperature, a compass and chronometer), or simply a plain face if drivers prefer a seamless calming digital detox wood veneer fascia continuing around the cabin. Add to that \u00a35,775 for the handy rear-seat entertainment system with maps, \u00a35,300 for a Bang and Olufsen audio system (Naim is an even higher spec), and \u00a31,905 for mood lighting.\n\nThough promising improved fuel economy, it still averages only a gas-guzzling 19.1mpg with CO2 emissions of 337g/km, so you\u2019ll need deep pockets to munch those miles. More frugal V8 petrol and V6 plug-in hybrid versions of the Flying Spur are in the pipeline as Bentley seeks to lower emissions and electrify its range.\n\nThe new Flying Spur hits the road as Bentley, founded on July 10, 1919 by Walter Owen \u2018W.O.\u2019 Bentley, celebrates its centenary year while undergoing a 5-step turnaround plan that will offer an \u2018electrified\u2019 version of all its cars by 2025.\n\nVolkswagen-owned Bentley is billing the new Flying Spur as \u2018the finest super-luxury sports sedan ever built\u2019 which is throwing down a gauntlet to BMW-owned Rolls-Royce.\n\nThey say it is such an advance in terms of technology, styling and comfort that it \u2018owes only its name to its predecessor\u2019. It has been recreated \u2018from the ground up\u2019 on a wholly new platform with sculpted surfaces and powerful lines made possible by the use of strong but flexible \u2018super formed\u2019 aluminium.\n\nIt is third generation \u2018modern\u2019 Flying Spur since Bentley was taken over by VW in 1998 \u2013 the first two being launched in 2005, since when more than 37,000 have been sold, and 2013. But its bold new grille with vertical vanes hark back to the original 1957 119mph Bentley S1 Continental Flying Spur costing \u00a38,034.\n\nFor added theatre, the illuminated retractable Flying B mascot which took two years to develop for Bentley\u2019s Centenary year and is linked to the welcome lighting sequence and keyless entry system as the driver approaches the car.\n\nCombining hi-tech and detailed craftsmanship, there are 5,331 intricately engraved diamond shaped \u2018knurlings\u2019 covering every point where the driver or passenger touches a rotary switch including on the air vents and centre clock.\n\nPowerful cut-crystal-effect LED matrix headlamps enhanced by chrome surrounds light the road ahead at night. New driver-assistance systems fitted as standard include \u2018traffic assist\u2019, \u2018city assist\u2019 and \u2018blind spot warning\u2019.\n\nTested to the max: Ray Massey also spent some time being chauffeured and pampered in the rear seats too\n\nThe cossetting seats \u2013 based around \u2018a comfortable armchair\u2019 - are available in new \u2018fluted\u2019 leather\n\nUp front, it's no less luxurious, with a wood pannels and the finest leathers\n\nI spent some time being chauffeured and pampered in the rear too, including in another car with optional 22-inch Mulliner specification wheels designed to emphasise the car\u2019s \u2018unique personality and prowess.\u2019\n\nYou are certainly surrounded in the lap of luxury. Cossetting seats \u2013 based around \u2018a comfortable armchair\u2019 available in new \u2018fluted\u2019 leather and, in what Bentley is claiming as \u2018an automotive world-first, bespoke Mulliner three-dimensional \u2018Cathedral\u2019 diamond quilted leather door inserts whose wing-like shape echoes the pattern on the wings of Bentley Flying B motif. This is in addition to the traditional stitching and embroidery work.\n\nFunctional seat technology includes including heating, ventilation, multi-mode massage, adjustable bolsters and \u2018top tilt\u2019.\n\nA folding centre armrest and a manually deployed centre headrest that stows away when not in use to maximise visibility\n\nTo let the light flood in, customer can also order a vast double-glazed panoramic glass sunroof stretching the full-length of the roof.\n\nA pop-out remote touch-screen in the rear integrates almost invisibly into the console and allows you to access applications which control blinds, rear seat massage rear climate control, and mood-lighting.\n\nIt also has the\u2018Toblerone-style\u2019 rotating centre console (first shown on the Continental GT) which has three faces: a 12.3 inch digital touchscreen; 3 circular analogue dials or a plain face\n\nIn July Bentley auctioned a Flying Spur First Edition - complete with Union Flag motif \u2013 at the Elton John Aids Foundation Gala in Italy raising \u00a3627,000 at the time\n\nThere is a choice of three audio systems culminating in a bespoke \u2018Naim for Bentley 2,200W, 19-speaker system.\n\nAn elegant floating centre console houses a 12.3-inch HD touchscreen. There\u2019 plenty of stowage, \u2018wireless\u2019 charging and to two USB sockets for mobile phones.\n\nBentley\u2019s traditional round \u2018bullseye\u2019 vents have been replaced in the centre of the dashboard with new shaped, precision detailed vents with a Bentley clock sitting between, with fine bronze detailing.\n\nThere is a standard choice of 17 exterior colours. The stylish interior features comfortable seats in a choice of 15 hide colours with Bentley\u2019s \u2018Wing\u2019 motif theme across the lower console and fascia and sweeping horizontal veneers flowing across the dashboard and into the doors.\n\nThe \u2018Flying Spur\u2019 name goes back to 1957 when coachbuilders H.J. Mulliner offered a four-door body on the two-door Continental chassis, creating the S1 Flying Spur of that year. The new four-door was named by H.J. Mulliner\u2019s managing director Arthur Talbot Johnstone after the heraldic device of his family, the Clan Johnstone of the Scottish Borders. The first example even featured the Clan Johnston\u2019s spur mascot on its radiator grille.\n\nIn July Bentley auctioned a Flying Spur First Edition - complete with Union Flag motif \u2013 at the Elton John Aids Foundation Gala in Italy raising the euro-equivalent of \u00a3627,000 at the time for the charity at the event hosted by Sir Elton and his partner David Furnish.", "description": "I was among the first in the world to drive this benchmark-setting Bentley - proudly designed and hand-built in Crewe in the firm's centenary year - ahead of its arrival in February.", "authors": ["Ray Massey For Mailonline And Thisismoney", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
