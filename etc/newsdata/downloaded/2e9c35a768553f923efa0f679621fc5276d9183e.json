She successfully unseated one of the most powerful Democrats in Washington, 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley, and has since spearheaded nationwide calls that are in-line with Mr Sanders' views, from the Green New Deal to drastically reducing student loan debt.\n\nThe two have also co-sponsored legislation including a bill that would cap the maximum interest rates on credit cards across the country.\n\nMr Sanders is the oldest candidate at 78. He declined to answer when asked how he would reassure Americans of his good health, saying only that he would run a \u201cvigorous campaign all over this country.\u201d\n\nSeventy-six-year-old Mr Biden argued that his experience and wisdom are assets because \u201cI know what has to be done\u201d as president. He also promised to release his medical records before the first nominating contest in Iowa in February.\n\nAnd Ms Warren, who\u2019s 70-years-old, promised to outwork, out-organise and outlast anyone, including the Republicans.\n\nDespite Ms Warren and Ms Ocasio-Cortez seemingly sharing a close relationship as well, it seems the progressive newcomer is ready to throw her support behind Mr Sanders and officially enter her influence into the 2020 election.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press", "description": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will officially endorse Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination at an event in New York on Saturday.
