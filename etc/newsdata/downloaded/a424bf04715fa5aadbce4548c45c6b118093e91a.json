But for the 3,000 residents of Setenil de las Bodegas, it\u2019s a simple fact of life. The Spanish town, one of Andalucia\u2019s \u201cPueblos Blancos,\u201d is built on a cliff with a rocky overhang. City streets are dotted with buildings that use the looming rock as roofs to cover their white-washed facades, and sometimes the entire road is covered by the rock\u2019s shadow. This location has served the city well for centuries as protection from the sun and invaders.\n\nThe town owes its unusual geography to the Rio Trejo, which eroded the gorge that the town is built in. The town\u2019s history can be traced back to neolithic times, with some evidence of pre-Roman inhabitants and visible remnants of Roman dwellers sprinkled around the region. Setenil de las Bodegas\u2019s steep, rocky location provided protection that proved advantageous during the 15th century, when Christian forces battling the Moors unsuccessfully attempted to defeat the town six times, until overtaking its castle on the seventh\u2014nearly 80 years after the first attack. The castle finally fell in 1484 after a 15-day siege and more than 700 years of Moorish rule.\n\nThe town\u2019s name, \u201cSetenil,\u201d derives from a Latin word meaning \u201cseven times nothing,\u201d in commemoration of the epic holdout. The second half of the name, \u201cde las Bodegas,\u201d is thought to refer to the vineyards introduced by new Christian settlers after the town\u2019s defeat. The wine storage units, or bodegas, were perfect for the cool caves. Unfortunately, the grape industry in the region was later wiped out in the mid 1800\u2019s by pests.", "description": "Living in a cave sounds like a big adventure.
