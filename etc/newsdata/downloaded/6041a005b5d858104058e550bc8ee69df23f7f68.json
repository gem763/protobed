Aside from being eye candy in the moment, these A-list looks often transform into trends; looks that get ripped out of magazines or screenshotted on phones for inspo, and taken to hairdressers, makeup pros and nail artists to recreate for weddings, big events and everyday life. But with the right expert direction, you might not need to call for reinforcement. Below, we talked to three Canadian pros behind some sensational TIFF red carpet beauty. We asked them what inspired their creative vision, and everything you need to know to create a similar look at home.\n\nMatthew Collins, Dyson Global Styling Ambassador\n\nYears at TIFF: \"...I think five years.\"\n\nChloe Bennet on the red carpet of the \"Abominable\" premiere (Credit: Phillip Faraone/Getty Images)\n\nThe look: \"I call [this] a silky S wave,\" says Collins of the hairstyle he created for Chloe Bennet's Abominable premiere red carpet look. \"Her premiere dress was a big beautiful blue gown \u2026 but the thing was, if you put her hair up, it would just be way too princess-y,\" he continues.\n\n\"We had a good laugh on the red carpet because one fan yelled, 'your hair is messy!'\" A bit of mess is exactly what he wanted, but there's no denying the sophistication of the look. \"At the same time, it is a red carpet, and we still needed to give a beautiful vibe to it,\" says Collins.\n\nWhy it's trending: \"If you're feeling slightly uncomfortable about anything in your outfit, this is your hair go-to. Every woman feels beautiful in glossy, healthy, wavy hair.\" Generally, messy hair was equated to a beach wave, not a formal glossy wave. \"I think creating the beautifulness [of a glossy wave] and then adding the texture on top really gives it something else,\" he says. Most women, notes Collins, tend to do this to their own hair anyways. \"It's like a nervous habit. You're going and grabbing the hair and messing it up.\"\n\nHow to recreate it at home: \"The best way to do this at home is to use the Airwrap,\" says Collins. The hair styler auto attracts and wraps hair, and applies heat to a safe level giving hair shine and suppleness. \"Then, I put a teardrop size of hair oil in my hands, and I put that through mid-way to the ends,\" says Collins. He follows up that step by applying texture spray from roots through ends and brushing it out with a wide-tooth comb. \"The final step is to spray the whole surface of the hair with a [wetter] texture spray because it will give it a bit more grit.\" Collins recommends quickly drying that wet product with a blow-dryer. All that's left to do is \"shake the hair with your hands and piece it where you need it pieced.\"\n\nWendy Rorong, manicurist at Plutino Group\n\nYears at TIFF: \"This is my eighth year doing TIFF.\"\n\nDakota Johnson on the red carpet of the \"The Friend\" premiere (Credit: GP Images/Getty Images)\n\nThe look: \"We decided to go with a nude,\" says Rorong of the nail colour she picked with Dakota Johnson for the star's Saturday premiere of The Friend. \"The black Dior she wore was like this beautiful Cinderella dress with, like, a sheer corset,\" explains Rorong. \"Dakota's features are also very feminine, she's very ethereal, so I didn't want to go with anything too dark or bright that would take away from that angelic feeling.\" The pick was a Deborah Lippmann colour Johnson has worn before called 'Brand New Day'. \"It's not too sheer but it's not opaque either. I would describe the texture as the perfect semi-sheer,\" says Rorong.\n\nWhy it's trending: Rorong wasn't surprised to see many of TIFF's biggest stars hit the red carpet with nude nails. \"I think the trend of the overdone hair, makeup and nails is dying down,\" she says. \"You want your nails to look nice, but you also don't want them to take away from the whole look,\" she advises. While it's a little bit safer, a semi-sheer nude looks good with everything too.\n\nHow to recreate it at home: \"Start with a clean nail plate, push away cuticles and buff nails to make sure you are starting with a smooth canvas,\" says Rorong. Otherwise, you might see the cuticles through the sheer polish, and also, your manicure won't last as long. Next, apply a base coat, two coats of the polish and a really good top coat she says. And when it comes to choosing a colour, think about your skin's undertone. \"Pick a shade that's similar so you're in the same colour family,\" she advises.\n\nJodi Urichuk, L'Or\u00e9al Paris Canada Makeup Artist & Expert\n\nHermione Corfield at an event for the \"Sea Fever\" premiere (Credit: Sonia Recchia/Getty Images for Epic Pictures)\n\nYears at TIFF: \"It's been over 20 years.\"\n\nThe look: When British actress Hermione Corfield arrived in Toronto for her festival premiere of Sea Fever she had a beauty look in mind says Urichuk. \"She wanted her skin to shine through, and a pop of colour on her eyes,\" says the makeup pro, who created two looks for the star. \"Day one was a white graphic liner with glowing skin and a stained lip, and for day two, we did a cobalt blue version of the same look with just a touch more lip. Her stylist had her wearing beautiful bold colours, so a touch of colour made sense and [we] kept it cool and modern.\"\n\nWhy it's trending: \"People are taking risks and really bringing their personalities into their looks on the red carpet,\" says Urichuk.\n\nHow to recreate it at home: \"Dewy skin starts with good skincare,\" says Urichuk, who recommends exfoliating first for a smooth application. To get that glowing look seen on Hermione, Urichuk recommends applying foundation or concealer only where needed with a small fluffy brush. \"If need be, I add a drop of moisturizer or hyaluronic acid serum into my foundation for that extra glow, she says. Next, she suggests focusing on the eyes. Begin by applying a few coats of mascara, before moving onto the liner. \"The hero products for these two looks were the L'Or\u00e9al Paris's White Party and Cobalt Blue liners,\" says Urichuk, who recommends starting by drawing on the wing first, then dragging the liner across from the inner corner to the outside wing. \"If you get a little on the lash it's an easy clean up.\" When choosing a red for lips, the Canadian pro favours a blue red. \"I feel like it's the most versatile and keeps teeth looking white,\" she says. \"I love a red lip worn like a stain, as well, blended out [to] the perimeter with a pencil brush.\" Finish the look by filling in and brushing up brows.\n\nCarly Ostroff is a Toronto-based fashion and beauty writer, content creator and TV expert.
