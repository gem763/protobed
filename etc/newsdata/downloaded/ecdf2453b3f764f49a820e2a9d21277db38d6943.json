Period,\u201d it said, adding that it had no intention of operating in China.\n\nThe senators also warned that TikTok could potentially be used to influence voters in next year\u2019s election in the same way Russians manipulated US social media in the 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cQuestions have also been raised regarding the potential for censorship or manipulation of certain content,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cTikTok reportedly censors materials deemed politically sensitive to the Chinese Communist Party, including content related to the recent Hong Kong protests, as well as references to Tiananmen Square, Tibetan and Taiwanese independence, and the treatment of Uighurs.\u201d\n\nThey acknowledged that the app does not operate in China, where ByteDance offers the similar but separate DouYin app, and that TikTok\u2019s user data is stored inside the United States.\n\nHowever, they said, \u201cByteDance is still required to adhere to the laws of China.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Two senior US senators called for the government to study national security risks possibly posed by Chinese-owned video app", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/b56fce_us-lawmakers-called-probe-chinese-owned-video-app-tiktok-it-had-potential-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
