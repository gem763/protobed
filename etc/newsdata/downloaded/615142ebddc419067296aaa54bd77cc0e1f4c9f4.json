Even if we lose, the American public will understand.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump made lengthy campaign-style speeches Thursday in Minnesota and Friday in Louisiana. Using a teleprompter on and off, he hit many of the same notes Saturday at the \u201cValue Voters Summit\u201d in Washington: the perils of socialism, his upstart 2016 victory, the need for strong borders, the success of his trade negotiations with China.\n\nThe annual summit is hosted by the Family Research Council, a Protestant activist group.\n\nTrump told attendees that his political opponents are trying to \u201ctear down\u201d Christians.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to silence and punish the speech of Christians and religious believers of all faiths,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey are trying to hound you from the workplace, expel you from the public square and weaken the American family and indoctrinate our children.\u201d\n\nIn remarks that stretched for over an hour, the president also touched on the outcry that\u2019s followed his decision this week to pull U.S. troops out of Northern Syria at the urging of Turkey, describing himself as \u201csort of an island of one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think our troops should be there guarding the border of Syria when we can\u2019t guard our own borders,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in 19-year wars.\u201d\n\nFormer U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said in an interview to air Sunday that the U.S. risks a resurgence of the Islamic State terrorist group by pulling remaining troops from helping out Kurdish fighters.\n\nTrump also did a lengthy phone interview Saturday night with Fox News\u2019s \u201cJustice With Judge Jeanine\u201d focused on impeachment, Syria and even the role of former President Barack Obama.\n\n(Updates with appearance on Fox News in final paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Jennifer Jacobs in Washington at jjacobs68@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, Ros Krasny, Linus Chua\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump spent a third consecutive night drinking in the adulation of his most diehard supporters, airing his grievances about the Democratic impeachment investigation to a meeting of religious conservatives.
