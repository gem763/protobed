Gavin Newsom said in a statement. \"Thanks to their tenacity and the work of countless others, this will now occur faster than originally envisioned. This is a big win for children, workers and public health in California.\"\n\nChlorpyrifos is used primarily on crops such as alfalfa, almonds, citrus, cotton, grapes and walnuts.\n\nCalifornia environmental regulators have targeted the pesticide for years. They have designated chlorpyrifos as \"a toxic air contaminant\" that poses health threats when inhaled or exposed to the skin of bystanders. The agreement includes a ban an aerial spraying.\n\n\"The swift end to the sale of chlorpyrifos protects vulnerable communities by taking a harmful pesticide off the market,\" said California Secretary for Environmental Protection Jared Blumenfeld in a statement. \"This agreement avoids a protracted legal process while providing a clear timeline for California farmers as we look toward developing alternative pest management practices.\"\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama proposed a federal ban on chlorpyrifos in 2015. But the EPA reversed course within three months of the new Trump administration.\n\nLast year the federal government's top fisheries experts issued a report saying that the pesticide and two others \u2014 diazinon and malathion \u2014 were washing into streams and rivers and harming wildlife, such as endangered species of salmon.\n\nChlorpyrifos has already been banned in Hawaii, according to the Associated Press.\n\nPesticide manufacturer Corteva Agriscience did not respond to NPR's emailed request for comment.\n\nHowever, it told the Associated Press: \"Through recent actions, the State of California has improvised and implemented several uniquely challenging regulatory requirements for chlorpyrifos. These new, novel requirements have made it virtually impossible for growers to use this important tool in their state.\"", "description": "State environmental regulators call chlorpyrifos \"a toxic air contaminant\" that is a health threat when inhaled or exposed to skin.", "authors": ["Richard Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/09/ap_19199808938579_wide-2bda9b042cabdb0162a0d940549adaced8df8415.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
