At The Verge, we\u2019ve already talked about this quite a bit, but Adobe keeps on coming up with new, ever more compelling demonstrations of this tech. As spotted by FastCo.Design, the company recently showed off some prototype AI tools at its annual MAX conference. They\u2019re all being developed by the company\u2019s Sensei unit \u2014 a machine learning division that\u2019s previously showed off a voice-activated Photoshop assistant and an automatic selfie tweaker.\n\nThese new tools are a little more substantial though. One, called Scene Stitch, is basically an advanced version of Content Aware Fill, Adobe\u2019s go-to method for removing unwanted items from images. But while Content Aware Fill looks within the picture being edited for plausible filler (copy and pasting in that patch of grass, or this rock) Scene Stitch uses Adobe\u2019s library of stock photos as a paint palette instead. It analyzes the image the user is trying to edit, and swaps in similar scenes and perspectives. You can see it in action in the video below:\n\nAdobe says it\u2019s also working on making this tool semantically aware, so it not only recognizes the composition of the image, but also the content. (E.g. it would suggest swapping out people with more people; trees with different trees.) From the perspective of someone trying to spot an edited image, this makes it much harder, as you can\u2019t just look for repeated patches of pixels.\n\nAnother feature, demoed under the codename Project Cloak, is essentially Content Aware Fill but for video. It allows users to isolate a specific part of a clip (say, a strap on a backpack, or a streetlight that\u2019s in the way of a nice view) and remove it with the click of a button. Making this sort of edit is already possible, but it usually requires going through a video frame-by-frame. It\u2019s hard work and takes skilled labor. In the video below, you can see Cloak managing the same task in just a few seconds:\n\nContemporary AI is proving to be a remarkably able tool for this sort of task. And although image and video editing isn\u2019t anything new, the possibility of giving easy-to-use tools like this to anyone who wants them may be a cause for concern. (See also: using AI to fake someone\u2019s voice.) Fake news, for example, could be turbo-charged by these sorts of capabilities, as could information warfare from nation states. In the future, \u201cseeing is believing\u201d might not be the axiomatic truth it is today.", "description": "They\u2019re just prototypes, but they show the power of AI to manipulate the visual world", "authors": ["James Vincent", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zdiQDyp1hzC9mVQixI-RehPp-Sc=/0x0:945x495/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9524891/Screen_Shot_2017_10_24_at_2.38.29_PM.png", "published_at": "2017-10-24"}
