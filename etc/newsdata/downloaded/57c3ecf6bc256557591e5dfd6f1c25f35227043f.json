Six (six!) years ago I detailed Google\u2019s massive effort to unify everything under Hangouts. Every year since then has been either a fiasco, catastrophe, retrenchment, or an outright retreat.\n\nAfter five years of that, Google threw in the towel and put the carriers in charge of text messaging on Android. It went all in on RCS Chat in April 2018, an SMS replacement that could be owned and operated by the mobile carriers.\n\nIt turns out that giving over control of your entire messaging product strategy to the companies that are focused on mergers, 5G, and TV streaming apps was a bad idea. Who could have guessed?\n\nCommand Line is The Verge\u2019s daily newsletter about computers, gadgets, and software. You should subscribe! I\u2019m eager to hear your feedback.

But there was a tiny chance that Google could use its longstanding partnerships and the significant leverage of making the most dominant phone OS on the planet to get everybody in line. Google offered up technical assistance and more to carriers, it pleaded and cajoled. Very little worked.\n\nWhich is why in June of this year Google pulled the band aid off the seeping wound of carrier RCS adoption. It announced that in two countries \u2014 the UK and France \u2014 it would just offer RCS services directly without waiting for carriers to figure it out.\n\nThen, silence.\n\nUntil yesterday, when Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint announced the \u201cCross-Carrier Messaging Initiative\u201d (CCMI). It\u2019s a joint venture, a whole other company that will offer business chat services to businesses and a new default texting app to Android users in 2020. It may or may not be a direct response to Google\u2019s implied threat that it would just take over texting for all Android phones in the US because nobody else was getting the job done \u2014 but the timing sure seems notable.\n\nThen, endless screaming?\n\nWe don\u2019t know yet, but we do know that apps that come directly from carriers \u2014 even ones for core services \u2014 are usually terrible. Witness: Verizon\u2019s VZNavigator, Verizon Message+, AT&T Navigator, AT&T messages. There\u2019s no word on whether or not RCS will be end-to-end encrypted, only a vague repetition of the word \u201cprivacy.\u201d\n\nAnd for the CCMI to even get to a place where it\u2019s offering an app that isn\u2019t riddled with ways for these carriers to feed the Angry God of Average Revenue Per User, it will need to simply succeed as a joint venture amongst the big carriers. Ask SoftCard (n\u00e9e Isis) how successful it was as a mobile payments competitor to Google and Apple Pay. You can\u2019t ask because it\u2019s gone. A more recent attempt: Zenkey, a password replacement app that is the right idea from the wrong companies.\n\nMost telling in all of this: Google was completely cut out of the announcement, to the point where it took the company several hours to cobble together a statement in response to the initiative. Google, which has spent the past few years aggressively lobbying for RCS.\n\nThe CCMI tells me that it plans to work with Google and others to ensure that their apps are compatible with its platform. It tells me that its text messages will be fully standards \u201cbased\u201d and compatible with RCS around the world.\n\nAt any time in the past five years, Google could have leveraged Android\u2019s 80-plus-percent market share and told carriers that it was launching a default messaging service that works like iMessage, falling back to SMS only when necessary. It\u2019s not in Google\u2019s nature to push partners around (though it does make exceptions). For reasons that probably seemed reasonable every time, when it came to messaging Google always blinked.\n\nAll that blinking and now the opportunity to simply fix Android\u2019s messaging mess by fiat might have passed. By handing control of Android messaging over to the carriers, Google wasn\u2019t just blinking \u2014 it was blinkered. Now the company has to scramble to make sure this entirely foreseeable outcome doesn\u2019t end up wrecking the default texting experience on every Android phone sold in America.\n\nIf Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint don\u2019t do a radically better job than they have in the past at offering good apps and good services, Android users will be stuck with something awful. If that happens, all Google will have really accomplished with its messaging machinations is to convince Americans that the only way to actually solve the messaging mess on Android is to buy an iPhone.\n\nMore from The Verge\n\nOvernight, after I put this newsletter (and myself) to bed but before it lands in your inboxes in the morning, I will have published a couple of stories.
