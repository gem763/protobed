The U.S. Justice Department declined to bring charges in the case, the statement added.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t admit or deny any of the SEC\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cQuad takes compliance very seriously, and we continuously enhance our policies and procedures in a manner that is consistent with the highest standards of ethics and integrity and our obligations under the law,\u201d the company said.\n\nFrom at least 2011 to 2016, a Quad/Graphics subsidiary in Peru paid or promised bribes to government officials to win contracts, and participated in a scheme to influence a tax dispute using illicit payments, according to the SEC.\n\nIn addition, the Peruvian subsidiary concealed transactions with a state-controlled telecommunications company in Cuba that was subject to U.S. sanctions, the SEC said.\n\nSeparately, between 2010 and 2015, a Quad/Graphics subsidiary in China made illicit payments, including to government officials, through phony sales agents with the goal of securing business, according to the securities regulator.\n\nQuad/Graphics was a privately held company until 2010, when it went public following its acquisition of Canadian printer World Color Press Inc., a move that gave the Wisconsin company a large international presence, according to the SEC.\n\nWrite to Kristin Broughton at Kristin.Broughton@wsj.com", "description": "The Sussex, Wis.-based business engaged in bribery schemes in Peru and China in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.", "authors": ["Kristin Broughton", "Kristin.Broughton Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-111485/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
