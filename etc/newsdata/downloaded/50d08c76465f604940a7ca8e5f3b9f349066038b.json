That\u2019s significantly lower than the $47 billion valuation set in a funding round earlier this year, reflecting skepticism over the company\u2019s governance and its ability to reverse steep losses.\n\nWe Co-founder and Chief Executive Adam Neumann controls a majority of the company\u2019s voting rights through special shares whose potency was recently enhanced.\n\nHis wife, Rebekah Neumann\u2014also a We co-founder\u2014is one of three people designated to serve on a committee that would choose Mr. Neumann\u2019s successor if he dies or is permanently disabled in the next 10 years.\n\nPotential investors have also questioned Mr. Neumann\u2019s sales of hundreds of millions of dollars of We stock and loans of more than $740 million tied to his shares in the company, according to Wall Street Journal reports and regulatory filings.\n\nWe officials and their advisers have been in an intensive series of meetings in recent days as questions swirl over whether the company will go through with the offering, one of the biggest in what could be a record year for new issues. But the choosing of a listing venue, together with the expected valuation cut and governance overhaul, show that it has decided to plow forward\u2014even if that means raising less that it had originally hoped.\n\nOne major motivating factor is $6 billion in loans We has arranged that are contingent on at least $3 billion being raised in the share offering.\n\nThe IPO frenzy this year has kicked up a heated battle between the NYSE and Nasdaq, which see big IPOs as franchise-defining opportunities that can help land subsequent business, become key marketing tools and represent new sources of trading revenue. The listing of We has been seen as one of the biggest prizes of the second half of the year after Nasdaq landed Lyft Inc. and the New York Stock Exchange landed Uber Technologies Inc. and the direct listing of Slack Technologies Inc. in the first half.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Peloton Interactive Inc. is planning to debut on Nasdaq and Endeavor Group Holdings Inc., the parent company of Hollywood\u2019s biggest talent agency, is slated to start trading on the NYSE.\n\nWe waited an unusually long time to decide on an exchange. Typically, large companies select one by the time they file publicly for an IPO. There are some companies that wait longer, but the most buzzed about IPOs of the past few years have picked a trading venue much further in advance of We\u2019s timing\u2014just days before the start of its investor roadshow\u2014in a sign of the behind-the-scenes scramble to keep the listing on track.\n\nDespite questions and concerns from investors, Mr. Neumann has said privately he is committed to moving forward with the IPO.\n\nIn conversations earlier this week with executives of SoftBank Group Corp. , the company\u2019s largest shareholder, Mr. Neumann said he doesn\u2019t expect anything fundamental to change in the next year and that he thinks the most important thing now is to get a large infusion of cash so he can continue his expansion plans, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nWrite to Maureen Farrell at maureen.farrell@wsj.com and Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com", "description": "WeWork\u2019s parent company has chosen to list its shares on Nasdaq and plans sweeping changes in its governance as the shared workspace provider speeds up preparations for its hotly anticipated initial public offering in the face of tepid interest from investors.", "authors": ["Maureen Farrell", "Corrie Driebusch", "Maureen.Farrell Wsj.Com", "Corrie.Driebusch Dowjones.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106887/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
