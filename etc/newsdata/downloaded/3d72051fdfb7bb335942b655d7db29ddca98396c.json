We asked some psychologists.", "language": "en", "text": "I don\u2019t remember any of this, of course. Three decades later, this un-fact-checkable story has gone the way of many campfire tales. It\u2019s mostly fun and only partly scary, though firm proof for this undeniable truth: Children are spooky little creeps who see ghosts, report past lives and chat at night with dead relatives.\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel like sleeping tonight, I suggest heading over to Reddit and falling down a terrifying rabbit hole. Jezebel collects and publishes an annual list for Halloween that will haunt you for the rest of the year. Turns out kids see ghosts all the time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen I fished for stories in my local moms\u2019 group, dozens of moms delivered in spades: a little boy who saw \u201czillions of people\u201d walking slowly through an empty cemetery; a 2-year-old who reported \u201cGrandma\u2019s in the sky with Pappy!\u201d minutes after her grandmother\u2019s death; and a child\u2019s especially disturbing imaginary friend named Suzy \u2014 her father\u2019s late first wife.\n\nThe phenomenon of kids (allegedly) seeing ghosts thrives online, but no matter how improbable or unprovable, the volume of these stories alone is enough to make scientists take notice. \u201cThere are admittedly lots of reports of kids seeing ghosts,\u201d says Jacqueline D. Woolley, psychology professor at the University of Texas. Woolley\u2019s research dives deep into children\u2019s evaluation and understanding of reality vs. the fantastical. She revels in my tale about the girl on the stairs: \u201cThat\u2019s enough to make you believe that it\u2019s real \u2014 for about a millisecond,\u201d she says.\n\nThough good Halloween fun, there are many holes in stories like mine, Woolley says. Namely, the brain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur minds naturally make connections between events, whether they\u2019re connected or not. The brain pays attention to evidence that fits our theory and ignores the evidence that doesn\u2019t fit,\u201d she says.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s far more likely that a child overheard the name \u201cSuzy\u201d a hundred times than the undead Suzy lingers in this realm for an eternity of tea parties.\n\nNext, consider children\u2019s fertile imaginations and you could easily argue that Suzy is not a ghost but actually an imaginary friend. \u201cWe know that between a third and two-thirds of children have imaginary companions,\u201d says Charles Fernyhough, a psychologist at Durham University, where he investigates the phenomenon of hallucinations. Not too long ago, imaginary friends were considered a precursor to mental illness; now we know they\u2019re a positive sign of healthy child development. \u201cNow adults come to me concerned if their kid doesn\u2019t have one,\u201d he says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDevelopmental psychologists such as Jean Piaget have been fascinated by the murky line between fantasy and reality for kids \u2014 whether it\u2019s imaginary friends or dreams or, yup, ghosts. Old thinking assumed kids just couldn\u2019t differentiate between what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not, while new thinkers such as Woolley believe \u201ckids know full what\u2019s real, even if it looks like they can\u2019t tell the difference.\u201d Fernyhough falls somewhere in the middle: \u201cI think on occasion kids do mix up imagination and reality to have something like a hallucination-like experience.\u201d\n\nIf you would never tell your child their imaginary friend isn\u2019t real, or that they\u2019re just imagining things or even lying, you should treat an encounter with a so-called ghost the same way. Which presents a strange question: How should you react if your little one reports a visit from the other side?\n\nMost important, do not flip out. \u201cA lot of parents get worried about imaginary companions and strange experiences,\u201d Fernyhough says. \u201cUnless there\u2019s real distress, do not worry.\u201d To know whether there\u2019s real distress, just ask the child.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou want to work with the emotion, not the ghost,\u201d Woolley says. Now is not the time for a grown-up lesson on imagination vs. reality. \u201cBecause if they\u2019re scared, it doesn\u2019t matter anyway,\u201d she adds.\n\nInstead, Woolley suggests you \u201cwork within the fantasy\u201d just like you might for a monster under the bed: \u201cEngage with the kid as to what it looks like and what it does. Ask her if she\u2019s scared of the ghost or if she likes it and if she\u2019s seen it before.\u201d A scary ghost can be tweaked as necessary \u2014 maybe you can help the child pretend he\u2019s in old-timey underwear, for example \u2014 to become a friendly one. \u201cThen it\u2019s up to you as a parent to decide if you want to encourage or discourage this belief.\u201d\n\nMy mother did the former, subscribing fully to the notion of friendly ghosts, which to this day are said to haunt our house. As for me, I\u2019d say I\u2019m 99 percent logical unbeliever, though really 1 percent is all you need. Even the scientists agree: \u201cIt\u2019s important to never say never,\u201d Woolley says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the scientific way to be.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt can\u2019t be easy, but child psychiatrist Jim B. Tucker is balancing science and the paranormal at the Division of Perceptual Studies at the University of Virginia. \u201cWe don\u2019t take the approach of believer or nonbeliever. We research and explore the phenomenon of children who report past lives,\u201d he says. Overlapping often are reports of kids who see dead relatives \u2014 including some who were dead long before the child was born.\n\nThey tend to go something like this: \u201cWhen my daughter was 3 years old, she started telling us that she was being woken up in the night by a man who kept tickling her feet,\u201d read one tale on BuzzFeed. \u201cWe figured she was just dreaming until we came across an old picture of my grandparents on their wedding day and my daughter pointed at my grandfather and said, \u2018That\u2019s him! That\u2019s the man who tickles my feet!\u2019 My grandfather passed away when I was six.\"\n\n\u201cWhen you hear enough stories like that, you do start to think there must be something there,\u201d Tucker says. \u201cI\u2019m open to it, that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d Whether you believe or not, his best advice is to be cool. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you really have to do anything other than listen to what your child says. Kids grow up and grow out of it and let it go.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut do they really? Here I am, three decades post little-girl-on-the-stairs, still loving this story. And now that I have my own toddler, I\u2019m sure she sponges up all my love of witches and ghouls come October. \u201cMy guess is that kids see ghosts much more commonly around Halloween when their parents believe,\u201d Woolley says.\n\nTo boot, one last story: We were curled up reading books the other night when my 2-year-old whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s someone at the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d I asked, peering at the dark empty doorway.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone at the door,\u201d she slowly repeated. Then she pointed matter-of-factly at the book we were reading, where Little Miss Lucky indeed had a visitor at her door, proving the only spooky creep in this bedroom was me.\n\nAD\n\nRosemary Counter is a Toronto-based writer and author who very disappointingly hasn\u2019t seen a single ghost this season.
