On Friday, the US aviation regulator revoked the company's certification.\n\nThe sensor fed information to the plane's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System - or MCAS. That software, which is designed to help prevent the 737 Max from stalling, has been a focus for investigators trying to find the cause of both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes.\n\nIndonesian investigators identified issues with the system, which repeatedly pushed the plane's nose down, leaving pilots fighting for control.\n\nIt showed there were incorrect assumptions about how the MCAS control system would behave and that the \"deficiencies\" had been highlighted during training.\n\nFurther, the report found that the first officer, who had performed poorly in training, struggled to run through a list of procedures that he should have had memorised.\n\nHe was flying the plane just before it entered into the fatal dive, but the report said the captain had not briefed him properly when he handed over the controls as they struggled to keep the plane in the air.\n\nThe report also found that 31 pages were missing from the plane's maintenance log.\n\nIndonesian investigators have previously said mechanical and design problems were key factors in the crash of the Lion Air plane.\n\nThis report describes a catalogue of failures - from poor communication to bad design to inadequate flying skills - which culminated in the deaths of 189 people.\n\nThere are lots of what-ifs here. If the crew of the previous days flight had given a more detailed description of the problems they'd faced, the aircraft might never have taken off on its fatal flight. And if the captain, who'd successfully kept the plane in the air - despite the intervention of a rogue automated system he didn't understand - hadn't handed over to his less-capable first officer, disaster might still have been avoided.\n\nAs Boeing's chief executive Dennis Muilenburg has repeatedly stated, there was a chain of events. But at the heart of that chain was MCAS - a control system that the pilots didn't know about, and which was vulnerable to a single sensor failure.\n\nBoeing - and regulators - allowed the system to be designed in this way and didn't change it after the Lion Air crash, leading to a further disaster. And that means that while the report clearly points to serious failures by a parts supplier and by the airline itself, it is Boeing that will bear the greatest share of responsibility.\n\nHow has Boeing responded?\n\nIndonesian authorities laid out some recommendations for Boeing in the report, including that it redesign MCAS and provide adequate information about it in pilot manuals and training.\n\nIn a statement, Boeing said it was \"addressing\" the recommendations from Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee.\n\nThe planemaker said it was \"taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 Max to prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again\".\n\nOn Tuesday, the firm ousted Kevin McAllister, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, making him the most senior official to leave the company since the two crashes.\n\nBoeing also said it expected the 737 Max to be re-certified for flying by the end of the year. The company said \"we look forward to continuing to work together\" with Lion Air in the future.\n\nA Lion Air spokesman said the crash was an \"unthinkable tragedy\" and it was essential to take immediate corrective actions to ensure a similar accident never occurred again.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'I lost my only son in the Lion Air plane crash'\n\nWhat has been the fallout for Boeing?\n\nThe pressure on Boeing to explain what it knew about the problems with the 737 Max has intensified. There were revelations this month that employees had exchanged messages about issues with MCAS while the plane was being certified in 2016.\n\nIn documents provided by Boeing to lawmakers, a pilot wrote that he had run into unexpected trouble during tests. He said he had \"basically lied to the regulators [unknowingly]\".\n\nBoeing said this week it had developed a training update and that it expected regulators to allow the planes to return to the skies before the beginning of 2020.\n\nThe grounding of the 737 Max has taken a toll on the planemaker.\n\nProfits more than halved to $895m (\u00a3687m) in the third quarter and the firm said it would cut production of its 787 Dreamliner, blaming trade uncertainties.\n\nBoeing boss Dennis Muilenburg was also stripped of his title as chairman by the board earlier this month, but remains as chief executive.", "description": "Investigators found faults by Boeing, Lion Air and the pilots led to the crash, which killed 189 people.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1A5A/production/_109364760_gettyimages-1056767376.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
