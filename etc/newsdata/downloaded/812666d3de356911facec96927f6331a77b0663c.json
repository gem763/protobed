Both companies operate in Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Axiata also has a presence in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Cambodia and Indonesia but its Bangladesh operation would have been excluded.\n\nTelenor said in a statement that it doesn\u2019t exclude that a deal could still be possible, adding the parties \u201cdo not intend to provide further comments.\u201d\n\nThe combined company would have been the largest telecom operator in Asia and potentially one of the world\u2019s top five mobile infrastructure companies. In Malaysia, a union of Axiata\u2019s Celcom and Telenor\u2019s Digi in Malaysia would have been the largest mobile operator in the country.\n\nAxiata had said the merged company would have been listed on the Malaysian stock exchange and later on an another international exchange.\n\nBesides its operations in Asia, Oslo-based Telenor also has operations in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland, totaling about 182 million customers for annual sales of about $13 billion. It is also involved in several joint venture operations.\n\nTelenor shares dropped nearly 5% in Oslo following Friday\u2019s news.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Telecom companies Telenor of Norway and Malaysia's Axiata Group Berhad have ended talks about merging operations in Asia, a deal that would have created the region's biggest telecommunications operator with 300 million customers in nine countries.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
