Bone-eating worms and scavenging eelpouts were devouring the remains, while octopuses and crabs explored the skeleton.\n\nYou can watch a video of the eating \u201cbonanza\u201d \u2013 as one of the marine researchers put it \u2013 on YouTube or on the research vessel\u2019s livestream site.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nMore than 4,000 feet under the waves of Monterey Bay, California, sits an underwater volcanic peak called Davidson Seamount.\n\nDuring an exploratory dive of this habitat on October 16, marine researchers stumbled upon a 16-foot-long whale carcass.\n\nThe scientists used a pair of unmanned remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to capture footage of the skeleton and the deep-sea denizens feasting on the creature\u2019s remains.\n\nWhale carcasses that sink to the bottom of the ocean like this are called \u201cwhale falls.\u201d They become new habitats because the cetacean\u2019s decomposing body provides food and shelter for myriad marine species. In the case of this whale fall, which the researchers determined was a baleen whale, the ROVs\u2019 cameras saw octopuses, eelpout (eellike skinny fish), and bone-eating worms sharing in the feast.\n\nHere\u2019s the video of this undersea \u201cbonanza,\u201d as one of the researchers put it:\n\nThe research team behind the footage is from the exploratory vessel Nautilus and the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The Nautilus is under the direction of Robert Ballard, who is best known for finding the wreck of the Titanic.\n\nRead more: The Titanic is slowly but surely disappearing \u2013 here\u2019s what the wreck looks like now\n\ncaption The Exploration Vessel Nautilus is a 210-foot-long research vessel owned by the Ocean Exploration Trust. source Ocean Exploration Trust/Institute for Exploration, Susan E. Poulton/EV Nautilus/Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe vessel boasts two ROVs, named Argus and Hercules, which are equipped to explore dark waters thousands of feet deep.\n\nThe group had originally been looking for brooding female octopuses on the flanks of the seamount. But on this dive \u2013 which happened to be the last of the season \u2013 the crew discovered far more than they bargained for.\n\ncaption An overhead shot of the almost 16-foot-long whale carcass. source Screenshot from Nautilus EV Live Stream\n\nIn the video, as Argus and Hercules approach the whale fall, you can hear the scientists\u2019 exclamations of delight at the sight of the carcass:\n\n\u201cWoah!\u201d\n\n\u201cHere we go baby!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that is phenomenal!\u201d\n\nWhen it was captured on camera, the partially digested carcass still contained some soft tissue, blubber, and internal organs. Countless scavenging eelpout and at least 15 octopuses glided in and out of the white ribs. Blankets of pinkish-red worms covered the vertebrae and tail bones.\n\ncaption Red-looking fuzz on the whale\u2019s tail are bone-eating Osedax worms that devour fat from the skeleton. source Screenshot from the Nautilus EV Live Stream\n\nOne of the scientists can be heard on the livestream identifying the worms as belonging to the genus Osadex, which is Latin for \u201cbone-eating.\u201d These snot-flower worms, also known as \u201czombie worms,\u201d burrow into bones in order to suck out the fat and oil inside.\n\n\u201cDinner is served,\u201d one researcher said.\n\ncaption Marine researchers discovered deep-sea octopuses, right, and eelpouts, center and left, exploring the whale carcass. source Screenshot from Nautilus EV Live Stream\n\nAs the footage cuts out, you can hear one of the researchers affirm: \u201cWe\u2019ll be coming back.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - During an unmanned dive in Monterey Bay, California, marine researchers filmed fish and worms munching on a whale carcass..
