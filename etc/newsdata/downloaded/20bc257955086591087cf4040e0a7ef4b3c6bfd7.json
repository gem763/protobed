But it\u2019s not a good excuse what happened tonight. I just didn\u2019t execute pitches.\u2019\u2019\n\nDespite hitting a home run, Nelson Cruz and the Twins lost Game 1 to the Yankees.

Stanton, who had one walk in 22 plate appearances last postseason, walked three consecutive times, flipping his bat in defiance twice.\n\n\u201cI just think it was a case that they were so much more patient today than they had been in the past,\u2019\u2019 said veteran pitcher Kyle Gibson, who gave up three walks and three runs in one inning. \u201cThey were aggressive early in the count, and then patient when they got to two strikes, and did a really good job battling off pitches.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lineup that\u2019s tough to navigate, no doubt about it. They can do some damage. The stress and pressure of dealing with that is always there, it\u2019s just how you deal with it.\u2019\u2019\n\nWelcome to the Bronx.\n\nThis was a game billed as a heavyweight fight, with a weigh-in more suited than a first pitch, with the two teams combined for 613 home runs -- 119 more than any two teams who ever played in a postseason game.\n\nYet, it was only the Twins who bothered to heed notice, homering in the first, third and sixth innings. The trouble was that all of the homers were only solo shots.\n\nThe Yankees instead opted to go rope-a-dope for most of the night with four doubles, two singles, eight walks, and a hit-by-pitch, before joining the fun by launching two solo homers in the sixth inning.\n\n\u201cThe last time we played these guys was just a few months ago,\u2019\u2019 Twins catcher Mitch Garver said, \u201cand some of the pitches they swung at then, they\u2019re not swinging at now. Some of the pitches they missed then, they\u2019re not missing now. We just got ourselves in situations we couldn\u2019t dig ourselves out of.\"\n\nThe strategy proved to be effective, and another gut-punch for the Twins, who were 34-13 when homering at least three times in a game, and had gone 11 consecutive postseason games without scoring more than four runs.\n\n\u201cAll we can do is shake it off and go back out there,\u2019\u2019 Twins reliever Tyler Duffey said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be ready. No one\u2019s going to be pressing. There\u2019s no panic at all in here.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Twins to a man stressed they weren\u2019t intimidated by the atmosphere. They\u2019ve won all year on the road, leading the major leagues with 55 victories. They love life on the road.\n\n\u201cWe love it,\u2019\u2019 said Nelson Cruz, who hit his 17th career postseason homer in the third inning. He now has more homers per plate appearances (10.06%) in the playoffs than anyone but Babe Ruth, with the third-highest slugging percentage behind only Ruth and Lou Gehrig.\n\n\u201cWe enjoy the hotels. And I guess we like hitting first, too.\u2019\u2019\n\nYet, by the end of this night in New York, the Twins had trouble seeing straight while the Yankees never blinked.\n\n\u201cWe could have played in front of 2,000 fans tonight and it probably would have been the same way,\u2019\u2019 Garver said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. That\u2019s the beautiful thing about winning the division. You get five games to advance. That\u2019s the way we look at it. There\u2019s no other options. It\u2019s a growing experience. It could be a completely different story (Saturday).\u2019\u2019\n\nBesides, even being down 1-0, the Twins say, they insist there\u2019s no pressure on them. It\u2019s all on the Yankees, who believe that every year they don\u2019t win the World Series is the ultimate failure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got nothing to lose,\u2019\u2019 Garver said. \u201cAre you kidding, we win 100 games and nobody thinks we can win? The Yankees 'are a good team. A great team. But they\u2019re supposed to win.' They\u2019re carrying that around.\n\n\u201cThey either just do what they\u2019re supposed to, or they hear about it forever.\u201d\n\nForever is an awful long time, but then again, so is 14 years, 11 months and 29 days.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "The Yankees handed the Twins their 14th straight postseason loss, a major league record, to take a 1-0 lead in the ALDS.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
