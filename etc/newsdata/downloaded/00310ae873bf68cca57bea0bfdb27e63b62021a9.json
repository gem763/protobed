Not the right. Don\u2019t let the mustache fool you. John Bolton was one of the most progressive people in the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, while Carlson was dancing on Bolton\u2019s grave, accusing Democrats of supporting him, and tying the extreme neo-con to the left, he didn\u2019t once mention that Bolton spent over a decade as a Fox News contributor before Trump hired him.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
