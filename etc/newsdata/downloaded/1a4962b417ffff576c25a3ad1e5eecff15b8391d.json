But England have basically been held together by Stokes and Broad. Take them out of this team and they have been belted by Australia in this series.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

AFP/Getty Images 2/11 Joe Denly - 5 Shuffled back up to the top of the order and showed the right kind of resolve as England searched for a draw, holding out for 123 balls.

AFP/Getty Images 3/11 Joe Root - 5 Made a battling 71 on day three then became the first England captain to make three ducks in a series when Pat Cummins bowled him with a snorter on the fourth evening. A second unsuccessful Ashes campaign as skipper. Getty Images 4/11 Jason Roy - 4 Swapped positions with Denly after a torrid time at opener, making 22 and 31. Still looks a long way from proving himself a Test batsman. PA 5/11 Ben Stokes - 4 A crash back to earth after his unforgettable outing at Headingley. Could not produce a third batting miracle of the summer and injured his right shoulder after an expensive stint with the ball. Getty Images 6/11 Jonny Bairstow - 4 Another disappointing return with the bat for a man whose tank might just be empty after a huge workload. Solid with the gloves. Action Images via Reuters 7/11 Jos Buttler - 7 Gave a good account of his battling qualities in each innings in what was easily his best game of the series. Needs a major score soon to silence doubts but this was a start. Getty Images 8/11 Craig Overton - 5 Selected to some surprise ahead of Chris Woakes and Sam Curran, the Somerset man's home debut was a mixed bag. His seamers were only a notch above functional but he dug down for nearly three hours in forlorn pursuit of a draw. AP 9/11 Jofra Archer - 4 Wicketless for the first time in his short Test career in the first innings and down on pace before his juices started flowing midway through the match. Still a huge talent but the quietest of his three outings to date. Action Images via Reuters 10/11 Stuart Broad - 7 Continued his playground bullying of David Warner, dismissing him twice for nought, and took his series wicket tally to 19 with five in the match. No blame attached here. Action Images via Reuters 11/11 Jack Leach - 5 Will forever rue the front-foot no-ball that cost England the best part of 100 runs from Steve Smith's bat, but plugged away and turned in another diligent tail-end defence.

You\u2019ve got to do the hard yards as well, and I\u2019m yet to see him do the hard yards.\u201d\n\nMcGrath believes Archer must look closely at Pat Cummins in particular if he is to translate to the longer form of the game.\n\n\u201cArcher can look to the example of Australia\u2019s Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, who have been extremely impressive in this series,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cCummins is the No 1 Test bowler in the world for a reason. He just keeps delivering.\u201d", "description": "Glenn McGrath has criticised\u00a0Jofra Archer and claimed he is yet to put in the \u201chard yards\u201d as an England\u00a0Test bowler in this Ashes series.\u00a0 Archer has made a tremendous impact in red ball cricket, shining at Lord\u2019s and then producing six wickets in an innings at Headingly.", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/10/10/Archer-struggled-at-Old-Trafford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
