And in that span of time, over $500,000,000,000 worth of LTC have been transacted. Looking forward to the next 8 years and more! \u201d\n\n\u201cWe have enough money to last 2 years\u201d\n\nThe first response to the birthday post immediately raised the specter of bankruptcy allegations, to which Lee robustly retorted:\n\n\u201cIt's [the Litecoin Foundation] not near bankruptcy. Don't listen to stupid fud and lies. We have enough money to last 2 years.\u201d\n\nThe allegations were sparked by a TrustNodes report last week that claimed the Foundation was down from $1 million in income in 2018 down to negative $70,000 by 2019.\n\nAt the time, Lee had responded to the report with a statement that the Foundation had an estimated 1 to 2 years\u2019 runway \u2014 with around $200,000 in its coffers.\n\nHe added that the company\u2019s financial prospects would also be guided by the outcome of the forthcoming Litecoin Summit, to be held at the end of October in Las Vegas.\n\nSpeakers will include high-profile industry figures such as Morgan Creek Digital Assets founder and podcast host Anthony Pompliano, Wyoming Blockchain Task Force president Caitlin Long, and the co-founder and former CEO of BTCC exchange Bobby Lee, among others.\n\nBitter accusations amid the birthday cheer\n\nWith Litecoin trading at roughly $57 as of press time, the altcoin is down almost 60% from its 2019 highs this June \u2014 reflecting the wider cooling of the crypto markets.\n\nLee himself had famously sold and donated all his LTC holdings back in Dec. 2017 \u2014 at the peak of the crypto markets\u2019 historic bull run: a decision he explained as motivated by a desire to avoid any conflict of interest and a step toward the thorough decentralization of the network.\n\nWhile some crypto Twitterers\u2019 appeared bitter about Lee\u2019s move to sell at peak prices, others defended Lee, pointing to the founder\u2019s role in warning others against overheated trading as he anticipated a \u201cmulti-year bear market\u201d would set in following Dec. 2017.", "description": "As Litecoin celebrated its eighth birthday on Oct. 13, its founder Charlie Lee fended off criticism about LTC and the Foundation\u2019s finances", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMjJlNjE5ZTNlZWFjYTBlNzYyYjc1Yjg1NzUxMGYyNGMuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
