She alerted jail deputies and nurses \"at least eight times that morning\" that she was in labor, the lawsuit claimed.\n\nShe was being housed in the jail's medical unit under the care of Denver Health staff, a spokesperson from the Denver Sheriff Department \u2014 which conducted an internal investigation after the incident \u2014 told The Washington Post.\n\n\"Ms. Sanchez had to endure this horrific experience despite the fact that multiple Denver Health nurses and Denver jail staff knew that: (1) she had been in active labor for hours, (2) she was days away from her due date, and (3) her water had broken hours before,\" the suit alleges. \"Instead of ensuring that Ms. Sanchez was able to give birth in a safe and sanitary medical setting, Denver Health nurses and Denver Sheriff deputies callously made her labor alone for hours, and ultimately give birth alone in a dirty jail cell without any medical care, because it was inconvenient to take her to the hospital during the jail's booking process.\"\n\nSurveillance footage used as part of the lawsuit shows Sanchez in apparent pain on her bed. Sanchez can be seen in the video with her mouth wide-open in a scream as she gives birth; a man wearing surgical gloves enters the cell just as her baby tumbles onto the bed.\n\n\"That pain was indescribable,\" Sanchez told KDVR in a 2018 interview. \"What hurts me more though is the fact that nobody cared.\"\n\nThe investigation conducted by the Denver Sheriff Department concluded that deputies \"took the appropriate actions under the circumstances and followed the relevant policies and procedures,\" a spokesperson told The Post in a statement.\n\n\"To make sure nothing like this happens again, the Denver Sheriff Department has changed its policies to ensure that pregnant inmates who are in any stage of labor are now transported immediately to the hospital,\" the department added in a a follow-up to The Post.\n\nThe department's spokesperson \"said it was up to the Denver Health medical staff members at the time to decide whether Ms. Sanchez should be taken to the hospital,\" The New York Times reported.\n\nDenver Health did not provide a comment to The Times, citing gthe case as a \"pending legal matter.\"\n\nSanchez was being held in the county jail at the time on charges related to identity theft, KDVR reported. Her attorney Mari Newman told The Post that the fact that it was deemed there was no wrongdoing in her client's case is \"emblematic of how broken the system really is.\"\n\nRead more: A pregnant woman who complained of stomach pains died in jail, according to her family\n\n\"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that a person who's been in labor for hours and whose water has broken is going to have a baby,\" Newman told The Post. \"The baby's not going to wait for book-ins. The baby's coming one way or the other.\"\n\nThe lawsuit claimed that the Denver Fire Department arrived roughly 15 minutes after Sanchez had given birth, and that she and the baby were transported to the hospital more than half an hour after she had given birth.\n\n\"They put my son's life at risk,\" Sanchez told KDVR in August 2018. \"When I got to the hospital, they said that I could have bled to death.\"", "description": "Surveillance footage used as part of the lawsuit shows Sanchez writhing in pain with her mouth wide-open in a scream as she gives birth on her bed.", "authors": ["Lauren Frias"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d6f583721214c503975b527?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
