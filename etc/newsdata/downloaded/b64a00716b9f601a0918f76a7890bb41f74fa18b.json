REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File Photo\n\nANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday it was unacceptable for nuclear-armed states to forbid Ankara from obtaining its own nuclear weapons, but did not say whether Turkey had plans to obtain them.\n\n\u201cSome countries have missiles with nuclear warheads, not one or two. But (they tell us) we can\u2019t have them. This, I cannot accept,\u201d he told his ruling AK Party members in the eastern city of Sivas.\n\n\u201cThere is no developed nation in the world that doesn\u2019t have them,\u201d Erdogan said. In fact, many developed countries do not have nuclear weapons.\n\nTurkey signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1980, and has also signed the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all nuclear detonations for any purpose.\n\nErdogan hinted that he wanted the same protection for Turkey as Israel.\n\n\u201cWe have Israel nearby, as almost neighbors. They scare (other nations) by possessing these. No one can touch them.\u201d\n\nForeign analysts say Israel possesses a sizable nuclear arsenal. Israel maintains a policy of ambiguity around the nuclear issue, refusing to confirm or deny its capabilities.", "description": "Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday it was unacceptable for nuclear-armed states to forbid Ankara from obtaining its own nuclear weapons, but did not say whether Turkey had plans to obtain them.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426265944&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF83250"}
