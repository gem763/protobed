Illustration: Thomas Nast\n\nLast year\u2019s so-called \u201ccivility debate\u201d revolved around the extent to which it was acceptable to protest the presence of Trump administration figures pursing private pleasures in public places, like the restaurants where Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders found themselves excoriated.\n\nBut in the Washington Post this week, Eve Fairbanks addresses a more difficult and important issue: How much of their own moral capital should progressives expend by accepting the grievances of \u201creasonable\u201d political opponents who want them to turn their backs on vulnerable allies and constituencies in the name of peace? It\u2019s one thing to stretch out the hand of fellowship to angry MAGA folk who would just as soon see you in prison or a reeducation camp. It\u2019s another thing to come to grips with Never Trumpers, center-right pundits, and other non-deranged folks who suggest they could become allies if only progressives would throw those people \u2014whether it\u2019s campus leftists, minority-rights activists, socialists, or proponents of radical reforms \u2014 under the bus. It can be tempting, particularly to political actors who are weary to the bone of constant warfare at every level of discourse.\n\nFairbanks offers a provocative analogy for these pleas from the \u201creasonable right\u201d: the very similar pleas from antebellum southern apologists for slavery who begged their counterparts in the North to eschew abolitionist extremists and make common cause to save the Union:\n\nProslavery rhetoricians talked little of slavery itself. Instead, they anointed themselves the defenders of \u201creason,\u201d free speech and \u201ccivility.\u201d The prevalent line of argument in the antebellum South rested on the supposition that Southerners were simultaneously the keepers of an ancient faith and renegades \u2014 made martyrs by their dedication to facts, reason and civil discourse.\n\nIt might sound strange that America\u2019s proslavery faction styled itself the guardian of freedom and minority rights. And yet it did. In a deep study of antebellum Southern rhetoric, Patricia Roberts-Miller, a professor of rhetoric at the University of Texas at Austin, characterizes the story that proslavery writers \u201cwanted to tell\u201d between the 1830s and 1860s as not one of \u201cdemanding more power, but of David resisting Goliath.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t read as much antebellum southern literature as Fairbanks has, but have been exposed to enough to recognize what she\u2019s talking about: a persistent strain of appeals to \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201crational\u201d people \u201cat the North\u201d to break ranks with the \u201cfanatics\u201d of the Republican Party and the abolition movement who are willing to destroy the nation to impose their radical social schemes on a resistant white and black population. Sometimes these Southerners posed as cultured Cavaliers opposing the bigoted Puritans of New England Congregationalist Calvinism who led the abolition movement. But their key argument was an offer of peace in exchange for tolerating slavery. It was powerful enough to keep the slavery issue more or less under wraps during the entire Second Party system in which Whigs and Democrats were each national coalitions held together by the tacit refusal to mess with the Peculiar Institution.\n\nThe real victims of this deal to maintain the peace were not, of course, the abolitionists (or their extremist counterparts in the South, the slavery-expansion zealots). The slaves themselves were presumed to be of too little civic (as opposed to economic) value to become a true casus belli.\n\nAnd while Fairbanks doesn\u2019t extend her argument to the politics of race that prevailed between the Civil War and the 21st century, the reasonable right was there all along, offering peace \u2014 for a price. Early on, southern defenders of restored white supremacy understood that their best prospects for success depended on convincing moderate northern opinion that Reconstruction was a bar to national reconciliation and economic recovery. While the white terrorists of the South who fought to crush voting, office-holding, and land ownership by ex-slaves were essential to the task of demoralizing well-intentioned Northerners, the real triumph of reaction occurred when Republican president Rutherford B. Hayes campaigned on an end to Reconstruction and then ascended to the White House after a contested election by consummating it. Within the South itself, social peace between rich and poor white citizens was achieved by an agreement that disenfranchising African-Americans was the top political priority, and Southerners wore down resistance to the imposition of Jim Crow by convincing an increasingly conservative Republican Party to abandon the \u201cbloody shirt\u201d and the cause of racial justice.\n\nThe peace-for-injustice bargain, of course, continued throughout the first half of the 20th century, where alternatively, Democratic Party unity and bipartisanship depended on the South\u2019s ability to veto civil-rights legislation. Even now, centrists of all varieties lament the passing of those golden years when white male senators got together over bourbon and cigars and cut deals that depended on the continued subjugation of people who did not look like them.\n\nLong after the antebellum era, in which Fairbanks hears eerie premonitions of today\u2019s \u201creasonable right,\u201d it was a powerful force in American politics. And its fundamental purpose was not so much to marginalize \u201cthe left\u201d or \u201cradicals\u201d as to sideline the powerless people for whom they spoke, often alone.\n\nDoes that mean the \u201creasonable right\u201d proponents Fairbanks worries about are racists or neo-Confederates? No, of course not. What they are, by and large, are people who fundamentally disagree with the idea (as expressed by, of all people, Barry Goldwater in his 1964 presidential nomination acceptance speech) that \u201cmoderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.\u201d For various reasons, they aren\u2019t particularly invested in progressive causes, and think reasonable center-left people should identify with their grievances against political correctness and the alleged cultural dominance of the radical left, and join with them in a coalition against left and right extremism.\n\nTo those of us who think the left is mostly (not always) right and the right is mostly (not always) wrong, these pleas for reason are the ultimate reflections of false equivalence, and the peace they offer is the troubled sleep of a guilty conscience. As always, those who will pay the real price for this sort of corrupt bargain are not \u201cradicals\u201d or \u201csocialists\u201d or \u201cthe politically correct,\u201d but the powerless people, some immigrants, but many more the descendants of the slaves sold out by \u201creasonable\u201d Yankees before the Civil War, or of ex-slaves sold out during the post-Reconstruction era, or the disenfranchised and exploited victims of Jim Crow sold out by bipartisanship.\n\nYes, we\u2019d all love to get along, particularly with non-crazy people on the center-right who are unhappy that their political vehicle the Republican Party fell into Trump\u2019s hands like a large piece of ripe, nearly rotting, fruit. But ultimately Pope Paul VI had it right with his slogan: \u201cIf you want peace, work for justice.\u201d", "description": "In an important essay, Eve Fairbanks observes how much today\u2019s \u201creasonable right\u201d sounds like antebellum apologists for slavery.
