The gel lubricates the esophagus, lines the stomach, helps sperm move past the cervix and guards nasal tissues.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRibbeck and her colleagues study compounds called mucins in mucus. Mucins are long polymers, or molecular chains, densely studded with sugars. They \u201clook like mini bottlebrushes,\u201d Ribbeck said, except bristling with sugar molecules where whiskers would be.\n\n\u201cMucus has for too long been considered bad in general public, but also in medicine,\u201d said Gunnar C. Hansson, who studies mucin compounds at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and was not a member of the team behind the new work. \u201cMucus and mucins are extremely complex to study and has been lagging almost all other types of biomedical research.\u201d\n\nThe textbook model of mucus \u2014 a filter that traps and eliminates microbes \u2014 isn\u2019t entirely accurate. \u201cWe added microbes into mucus and we saw they don\u2019t get trapped at all,\u201d Ribbeck said. Inside a glob of mucus, bacteria swim freely, in a state the scientist describes as \u201cplanktonic.\u201d That helps our immune systems. A lone drifter, as opposed to many germs gathered in tough-to-penetrate clumps, makes an easier target for immune cells.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut not all bacteria need to be killed. Only a minority, in fact, are harmful. \u201cWe have trillions of microbes growing outside and inside of our body,\u201d Ribbeck said. Microorganisms that live in the mucus of the digestive tract, for instance, help process food. \u201cWe provide the microbes the home, and in return, they do a service,\u201d Ribbeck said. Mucus, she suspected, might be part of the process that domesticates germs into friendlier inhabitants.\n\nKelsey Wheeler, a doctoral student in Ribbeck\u2019s lab and a co-author of the paper, said that previous research showed purified mucins prevented several types of potentially harmful microbes from clumping up. The new study is the first, she said, to \u201cidentify that the glycan component\u201d \u2014 meaning, the sugars grafted to the mucins \u2014 \u201cis responsible for suppressing antagonistic microbial behaviors.\u201d\n\nThe scientists used several experiments to test the power of mucus. They embedded microbes in globs of mucus, what Ribbeck called \u201ca three-dimensional mucus matrix.\u201d They cultured germs alongside human epithelial cells and mucus sugars. And they used the sugars to heal infected burn wounds in pigs. (To gather enough mucus to study, researchers collected donations of human saliva and scraped out pig guts.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWheeler, Ribbeck and their colleagues tested how the sugars interacted with a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The microbe does not normally cause disease, except when it infects people with cystic fibrosis or compromised immune systems.\n\nThe scientists wanted to know whether sugars worked by themselves, so they shook the glycans free from the polymer. (Imagine snipping the whiskers off a bottlebrush.) Pseudomonas reacted to the sugars by becoming less infectious. The mucus compounds suppressed various genetic pathways in the bacteria including factors related to killing other microbes, toxin secretion, cell-cell communication and clump formation.\n\nMucus sugars are \u201clike pixie dust,\u201d Ribbeck said. \u201cOh my goodness, they\u2019re so active.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPediatrics professor Lars Bode, who studies sugars in breast milk at the University of California at San Diego and was not involved with this research, was intrigued by these abilities. Breast milk contains many small sugar molecules with similar structures, which Bode hypothesized may have similar effects when they are passed from mother to infant.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cInstead of using antibiotics when these things turn against us, why don\u2019t we prevent them from turning against us in the first place?\u201d Bode said.\n\nResearch not yet published suggests that the sugars can tame other types of microorganisms, including yeast and the bacteria Streptococcus mutans, Ribbeck said. The scientist was excited by the therapeutic potential of these molecules, she said, as more bacteria become resistant to drugs meant to kill them.\n\n\u201cChanging their ability to cause infections could be a really potent strategy,\u201d Ribbeck said. Call it the taming of the goo.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Mucus isn't just a physical barrier to microbes \u2014 its potent biochemistry helps stop bacteria, too.", "authors": ["Ben Guarino", "Reporter Covering The Practice", "Culture Of Science"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sBhtpM_H9wd-iKNUyxJeaCzEAbA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/USBHPIGCSYI6RFCR5B4PS27BTM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
