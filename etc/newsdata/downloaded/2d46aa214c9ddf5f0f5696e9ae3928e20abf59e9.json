Here's how to stop them from taking your data", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Kim Komando tells you how to speed up sluggish home wi-fi. Kim Komando, Special for USA Today\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 The connectivity at Black Hat and DEF CON is not where you want to gamble. Both conferences attract thousands of information-security professionals, some of whom will snoop around networks here.\n\nA potentially sketchy Wi-Fi or cellular connection does not, however, require carrying a burner phone or cringing in airplane mode. As talks and presentations here outlined, basic precautions help keep you private and secure \u2013 precautions some attendees ignored.\n\nKeeping these four suggestions in mind can help keep your data and devices safe, even when you aren't at a hacker convention \u2013 or, at least don't think you are.\n\nWith people being expected to work from anywhere, anytime on anything, new ways to access VPN-like services are popping up.

Your browser encrypts connections to compatible sites automatically. If you use a separate email app, that should\u2019ve activated the same protection when first set up.\n\nSupport for encryption has steadily grown. Google reports that 82% of pages in Chrome for Windows and 94% of messages sent to Gmail users now come encrypted. Your browser should identify site encryption in its address bar \u2013 Chrome is more aggressive about this \u2013 and Gmail will warn if a recipient email declines encryption.\n\nAlas, encrypted traffic on Black Hat\u2019s Wi-Fi has yet to surpass about 70%, researchers Neil Wyler of RSA Security and Bart Stump of Optiv Security said in a talk last Thursday.\n\nSome attendees not only used mail services that didn\u2019t scramble messages but sent sensitive documents over them. Wyler showed a screenshot of an attached mortgage statement (with personal data redacted) and commented: \"Dude, you are sending a lot of financial information in the clear.\"\n\nMore such bad judgment awaited at DEF CON\u2019s Wall of Sheep, a screen showing usernames and passwords sent sans encryption.\n\nScrambling data sent between your devices and sites is the easiest eavesdropping defense.

Although both Apple and Google require app developers to encrypt their communication, researchers have caught exceptions even in such name-brand apps as the dating app Tinder. In June, Wandera found two-thirds of iOS apps didn\u2019t use iOS\u2019s encryption framework.\n\n\"We've seen a fair number of big brands leak sensitive data,\u201d said Wandera\u2019s product-strategy vice president Michael Covington in an interview here Friday. \u201cIt tends to be in one particular workflow where we see the leak\u201d \u2013 some tasks happen with encryption, others don\u2019t.\n\nResearcher Mike Spicer cited other examples in a talk Friday evening about Wi-Fi at security conferences: weather apps leaking unencrypted location info.\n\nSo you might prefer mobile web sites to apps from the same companies.\n\nVPN with care\n\nA virtual private network service encrypts your entire connection and makes even dodgy apps and mail services gibberish to others on the same Wi-Fi (it\u2019s still dumb to employ anything but official networks at hacker events like DEF CON) or cellular network (4G LTE encrypts connections but not strongly). But VPNs aren\u2019t magic dust.\n\nThey cost money \u2013 those endorsed by review sites PCMag and Wirecutter cost $35 and up annually \u2013 and can slow your connection. And they require careful configuration to enable such backstops as kill-switch settings to take you offline if the VPN\u2019s encrypted link drops.\n\nSome VPNs, especially those offered for free, can harvest your data. In January, Apple and Google booted a Facebook research app built on VPN software earlier evicted by Apple.\n\nInstall updates but not new apps\n\nOne last bit of advice applies anywhere you roam: Install security patches as soon as they\u2019re available. You will not outsmart Apple, Google or Microsoft at defeating attackers rushing to exploited newly-discovered \u201czero-day\u201d vulnerabilities.\n\nAt the same time, using untrusted bandwidth means avoiding new apps, especially from outside Apple and Google\u2019s reasonably-policed app stores. The only scenario in which a friend has admitted to getting malware on their phone: an attempt at DEF CON to install a mobile-hotspot app from a developer\u2019s site.\n\nRob Pegoraro is a tech writer based out of Washington, D.C.
