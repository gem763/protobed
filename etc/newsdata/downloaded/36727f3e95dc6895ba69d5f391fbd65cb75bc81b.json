Williams is also a key ally of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nGiven that the economy is in a good place despite the downside risks, Fed officials are split about what to do with interest-rate policy.\n\nSome of the more-hawkish officials, including Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, want the Fed to hold off rate cuts until there are clearer signs of a downturn. Others, like St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, want the central bank to be aggressive and cut rates immediately by a half-point.\n\nThis has made the Fed leaders, like Williams, less able to precisely guide the market about the upcoming path of policy.\n\nFed watchers will note that Williams did not \u201cpush back\u201d on market pricing of a 100% chance of a quarter-point interest-rate cut at the Sept. 17-18 meeting.\n\nPowell will speak on Friday after the August jobs report.\n\nRead: Powell to get last word on outlook on interest rates after next Friday\u2019s job report\n\nIn his speech, Williams said he was \u201ccarefully monitoring\u201d the economy and was going to \u201cremain vigilant.\u201d These catch phrases have often been used in the past to signal support for immediate rate moves.\n\nU.S. stocks soared Wednesday as Hong Kong tensions were seen easing.
