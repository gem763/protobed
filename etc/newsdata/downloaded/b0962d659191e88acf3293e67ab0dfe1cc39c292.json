REUTERS/ Gene Blevins/Files\n\nThe company, a unit of Edison International (EIX.N), said through a spokeswoman that it had notified the California Public Utility Commission on Oct. 11, the day after the fire started, that \u201cour system was impacted near the reported time of the fire.\u201d\n\nThe \u201celectric safety incident\u201d report, a copy of which the utility provided to Reuters, identified the facility involved as a company-owned transmission tower near a traffic intersection in the foothills where the Saddleridge fire is thought to have erupted.\n\nLos Angeles Fire Department spokesman Captain Erik Scott said Monday that the cause of the fire was uncertain. But he said investigators had traced the fire\u2019s origin to a slope beneath the high-voltage tower near Saddle Ridge Road.\n\nThe Southern California Edison report does not state whether the tower is suspected of sparking the blaze, or whether the tower or the power lines were damaged by high winds that quickly spread the flames over thousands of acres. But the Edison spokeswoman, Susan Cox, confirmed that the tower in question belonged to the utility.\n\nEdison had turned off power to some customers across the region as a precaution last week after extreme winds and dry weather raised the risk of wildfire. But a utility spokeswoman was quoted as telling the Los Angeles Times on Sunday that Edison \u201cdid not de-energize any power for the Saddleridge fire area.\u201d\n\nIn Northern California, utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co (PG&E) faced increasing criticism from the governor and state regulators on Monday for its own wide-scale precautionary power shutdown, which preceded Edison\u2019s by about a day but was seen as being poorly managed and communicated.\n\nThe Public Utility Commission on Monday ordered PG&E to undertake immediate \u201ccorrective actions,\u201d and Newsom called for the company to provide credits or rebates to affected customers.\n\nPG&E Corp CEO Bill Johnson defended his company\u2019s actions, conceding \u201careas where we fell short\u201d during the power cutoff but insisting PG&E made \u201cthe right decision.\u201d He also noted that there were \u201cno catastrophic wildfires\u201d in the utility\u2019s service area last week.\n\nORIGIN PINPOINTED, CAUSE STILL UNKNOWN\n\nThe Saddleridge fire was the latest in a string of severe California wildfires for which electrical utility equipment has been scrutinized as a possible flashpoint.\n\nThe blaze scorched nearly 8,000 acres, threatening more than 17,000 homes and triggered the evacuation of 100,000 people before a change in the weather helped firefighters subdue the conflagration over the weekend.\n\nAt last count, 75 homes or other structures were damaged or destroyed, and a man suffered a fatal heart attack while trying to defend his property from the flames.\n\nEdison\u2019s power lines were determined to have been the ignition source for a much larger fire in December 2017 that killed two people and destroyed more than 1,000 structures in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, northwest of Los Angeles.\n\nPG&E equipment PGC.N was found to have sparked a flurry of wildfires that swept through wine country north of San Francisco Bay in 2017, as well as last year\u2019s devastating Camp Fire, which killed 85 people in and around the Northern California town of Paradise.\n\nPG&E, the state\u2019s largest investor-owned utility, filed for bankruptcy in January, citing more than $30 billion in potential liabilities from the fires.", "description": "A deadly wind-driven wildfire that raged across the northern edge of Los Angeles last week started near the base of high-voltage transmission tower owned by electric utility Southern California Edison, company and fire officials said on Monday.", "authors": ["Steve Gorman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1440988080&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E08G", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
