The regulation had hampered local investment companies from making active expansions overseas and placed them at a disadvantage against foreign competitors.The Finance Ministry said the Financial Services Commission will propose legal amendments to the National Assembly by December in a bid to encourage active overseas business activity by the finance sector.The latest announcement falls under the government\u2019s new headline \u201cinnovative growth\u201d policy that seeks new growth engines by helping businesses as Korea struggles with a slowing economy.It is a marked shift from the government\u2019s past \u201cincome-led growth\u201d policy that focused on increasing wage levels to encourage more spending and, in turn, economic growth.\u201cUnder the innovative growth policy, we are focusing on improving economic activity at the moment while [\u2026] making preparations for future growth engines in the long term,\u201d said Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki during a senior government meeting at the Government Complex in Sejong.\u201cWe need to lead integration between industries as well as improve old policies.\u201dHong discussed additional government plans during the meeting such as support for the auto industry\u2019s transformation into environmentally-friendly and connected mobility platforms.The government promised to change regulations for the auto industry such as easing strict local safety standards for vehicle traction batteries to international levels and allowing hydrogen charging stations to be built at existing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) charging stations.The deregulation announcement also covers changes to rules that have stifled local businesses such as overlapping government inspections.The government plans to make administrative changes by September next year so that chemical plants won\u2019t have to make separate safety reports to the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Employment and Labor. They will instead submit a combined safety and environment report to authorities, cutting back on redundant administrative processes and paperwork.The policy push to help businesses by removing regulatory stumbling blocks also marks a change toward proactive deregulation.The government had previously supported the so-called regulatory sandbox program in which it eased select regulatory hurdles requested by businesses under limited conditions.The deregulation announcement also underscores a sense of urgency to help businesses that have been hit by an economic slowdown.State-backed think tank Korea Development Institute said in its recent monthly report that Korea\u2019s economy remains stagnant on shrinking exports. Outbound shipments recorded a 10th consecutive month of on-year declines last month.Meanwhile, facilities investment has remained low compared to 2018, falling 2.7 percent in August from the previous year.Credit ratings agencies have expressed concern over Korea\u2019s economy this year and next year amid broader weakness in the global economy.Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) projects Korea\u2019s economic growth this year at 1.8 percent, far lower than the government\u2019s target range between 2.4 and 2.5 percent.Fitch Ratings, another global credit rating agency, has reduced the country\u2019s GDP growth forecast for next year by 0.3 percentage points to 2.3 percent, citing growing trade risks.The Finance Minister will meet officials from S&P during his trip this week to Washington to take part in the G-20 finance ministers\u2019 meeting and the annual International Monetary Fund and World Bank conferences.BY CHAE YUN-HWAN [chae.yunhwan@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
