The whole country was teary-eyed after his return and he became the nation's hero. The only man to ever shoot down a F-16 fighter.\n\nHe was also bestowed with the country's top military honour, Vir Chakra, on Independence Day (August 15) for his tremendous courage and valour. Now, he is back in action or rather we'll say back in his cockpit and started flying MiG-21 jet again. Vir Chakra is the third highest gallantry award after the Paramvir Chakra and the Mahavir Chakra.\n\nPicture Credits: PTI", "description": "On this 87th Air Force Day, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman flew a MiG-21 at an air show that was held at the Hindon Air Base in Ghaziabad during the celebrations of the day on Tuesday.
