The app, called HKMap, tracked police presence and was used by pro-democracy activists, but was removed earlier this month after Apple claimed it was being used for criminal activity. The app\u2019s developers said there was no evidence of that, and Apple has been slammed for the move.\n\n\u201cCases like these raise real concern about whether Apple and other large US corporate entities will bow to growing Chinese demands rather than lose access to a billion Chinese consumers,\u201d the letter says.\n\nThe letter was signed by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI), and Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ).\n\nThe second letter, signed by some of the same lawmakers, was sent to Activision Blizzard CEO Robert Kotick, and similarly criticizes the company\u2019s decision to ban a competitive Hearthstone player who voiced support for the Hong Kong protesters. The letter says the \u201cdisappointing decision could have a chilling effect on gamers who seek to use their platform to promote human rights and basic freedoms.\u201d\n\nThe letters suggest the issue of Chinese censorship is one that both Democrats and Republicans are ready to rally behind, to the detriment of companies looking to operate in the country.\n\n\u201cYou have the opportunity to reverse course,\u201d the lawmakers wrote to Kotick. \u201cWe urge you to take it.\u201d", "description": "In two letters, a bipartisan group of lawmakers sharply criticized Apple and Blizzard over their recent censorship actions in China.", "authors": ["Colin Lecher", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hKGpHn0aFaBzoaCnSt_0PQ_I1UE=/0x446:6238x3712/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19299959/1171005834.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
