Dressed in a neat uniform, she politely offers passengers meals and drinks while they cruise at 35,000 feet. Recently though, she\u2019s been switching shifts to make sure that she\u2019s in town to join the protests that have rocked Hong Kong for the last 15 weeks. For those, she trades in her meticulous Cathay Pacific attire for a black t-shirt, accessorized with a yellow hardhat and a facemask: the uniform of Hong Kong\u2019s young protesters.\n\nLucy, 30, who asked to be identified by only her first name, says her friends describe her as \u201cdeep yellow,\u201d local slang which means she is a staunch supporter of the democracy movement. She camped out on the streets during the 2014 Umbrella Movement, and she\u2019s taken to the streets again this year.\n\nDemonstrations have roiled Hong Kong every weekend since June. They began as a few peaceful marches against a now suspended extradition bill that critics say would have allowed Beijing to use politically-motivated charges to ship dissenters off to face trial in the Communist Party controlled court system. But they have since escalated into intense pro-democracy protests that often end in violent clashes with police.\n\nIn the last few months, Lucy says she has been teargassed several times and hit on the head by a projectile fired by police. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to go from a flight attendant to a gas-masked protester,\u201d she tells TIME.\n\nHer employer has been sucked into the fight between the city\u2019s youthful protesters and Beijing. In August, China\u2019s aviation authority banned any Cathay Pacific staff who had taken part in \u201cillegal protests\u201d from flying mainland routes, and threatened not to allow any flights without an approved crew list into Chinese airspace.\n\nFor Cathay Pacific, which counts 26 of its 111 destinations on the mainland, and earns half of its income from tickets purchased in Hong Kong and China, losing access to Chinese airspace would be a blow from which it might never recover.\n\n\u201cAny company that gets most of its revenue from the mainland is in a pickle,\u201d Alexander Zwagerman, Senior Lecturer at Arnhem Business School, tells TIME. \u201cBeijing clearly demands that [companies] disavow any semblance of an allegiance to the Hong Kong people and even punishes workers with links to the protesters.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of what Zwagerman calls \u201cBeijing\u2019s most heavy-handed use of its economic clout to date,\u201d Cathay Pacific quickly capitulated. Several employees were fired for protest-related reasons, and a few senior staff members, including the CEO and the chairman, have since stepped down.\n\nCathay has now warned employees that it will take a zero-tolerance approach to \u201cany support for or participation in illegal protests, violent activities or overly radical behavior.\u201d But employees like Lucy say they have no plans to stop. \u201cThe company has no right to control our minds or our speech when we\u2019re not working,\u201d she tells TIME.\n\nLucy has nevertheless taken steps to make sure she\u2019s not found out, like setting her Instagram profile to private. When she worked a flight to Beijing last month, she left her phone at home for fear of having it searched by mainland officials.\n\nForeign and Hong Kong companies wanting access to China\u2019s vast consumer market have long had to comply with Beijing, but the protests have seen a dramatic intensification of China\u2019s expectations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve rarely seen Hong Kong firms so publicly brought to heel as we have over the past few months,\u201d Jude Blanchette, Freeman Chair of China Studies at the Washington D.C.-based think-tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells TIME.\n\nSeveral other large companies have been dragged into the fray. After staff of the so-called Big 4 accounting firms crowdfunded a pro-protest advertisement in a local newspaper, the Chinese state-run Global Times urged management at the firms to fire \u201cpro-riot staff\u201d who \u201chave the wrong stance on the current Hong Kong situation.\u201d\n\nOne of the companies, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) quickly issued a statement saying it firmly opposed \u201cany action and statement\u201d that challenged \u201cnational sovereignty.\u201d\n\nIn September, fast fashion giant Zara was forced to issue a statement declaring support for China\u2019s sovereignty over Hong Kong, after Chinese netizens went into a frenzy on the microblogging site Weibo because the retailer shut down its Hong Kong stores on the day of a strike in the city.\n\nOther local businesses that have shown allegiance toward either side have drawn the ire of customers.\n\nAn extensive Google Doc circulating around the Reddit-like forum LIHKG, for example, details restaurants that should be avoided by pro-democracy diners. Justifications for blacklisting establishments on the crowd-sourced list are as tenuous as someone overhearing a waiter saying protesters are paid by foreign governments.\n\nRiot police stand in front of a restaurant while patrolling after an anti-government rally in Hong Kong on August 18, 2019. Isaac Lawrence\u2014AFP/Getty Images\n\nBig brands, like the sports drink Pocari Sweat, have pulled advertisements from a local television station viewed as pro-Beijing to avoid losing customers.\n\nSome protesters have called for boycotts the city\u2019s subway system, the Mass Transit Railway (MTR), because it closes stations near protest locations but has been found to be transporting riot police.\n\nOne MTR employee in his early 30\u2019s tells TIME that although he is an unwavering supporter of the protesters, his job with the majority-government-owned operator puts him in a tight spot. He fears that he\u2019ll be fired if he takes part in protests. So instead he spends weekends at his computer screen, glued to live stream videos of the events unfolding on the streets below him, cheering the protesters on.\n\nRead More: Hong Kong Businesses Are Reeling Amid the Protests, But Their Workers Say \u2018Freedom\u2019 Is More Important\n\nThe politicization of Hong Kong\u2019s companies has hurt the business hub\u2019s reputation. \u201cHong Kong\u2019s position as a global hub for finance and business has suffered an irrevocable wound,\u201d Blanchette says.\n\nIn what is perhaps the clearest signal yet that trust in the city\u2019s safeguards has been undermined, Fitch Ratings announced the downgrade of Hong Kong\u2019s credit rating and outlook on Sept. 6, citing China\u2019s growing influence in the territory\u2019s affairs. The \u201cperimeters and pliability of the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 framework\u201d has been tested in recent months, with mainland officials \u201ctaking a more public stance on Hong Kong affairs than at any time since the 1997 handover,\u201d Fitch said in its press release.\n\nDespite orders from Beijing for companies to tell their employees to fall into line, some of their workers say they will keep fighting.\n\nAntonia (a pseudonym), 31, a PwC employee, says she\u2019s furious about the tactics police have used against young protesters. She tells TIME that she won\u2019t stop attending rallies until the government agrees to an independent inquiry into the police\u2014even if she has to pretend to be going on vacation in order to do so, like she did for several days in June.\n\nAnd Lucy the flight attendant says she\u2019ll keep switching shifts to make sure she can be on the front lines with her fellow Hongkongers.\n\n\u201cI still think I\u2019m doing the right thing and I should keep doing it,\u201d she says.\n\nBut for Hong Kong companies that depend on access to the Chinese market for their bottom line, things aren\u2019t quite so simple. In the Hong Kong business world, Zwagerman says: \u201cBeijing has made it clear who\u2019s boss.\u201d\n\n\u2014With reporting by Aria Hangyu Chen\n\nWrite to Amy Gunia at amy.gunia@time.com.", "description": "Cathay Pacific and the Big 4 accounting firms have publicly denounced protests in Hong Kong, but their employees are among those protesting.", "authors": ["Amy Gunia", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/hong-kong-protests-staff.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C58px%2C1024px%2C536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
