Official Khamenei website/Handout via REUTERS\n\nTrump said on Monday that it looked like Iran was behind the weekend strike at the heart of the Saudi oil industry, which cut 5% of global production, but stressed he did not want to go to war. Iran denied it was to blame.\n\n\u201cIranian officials, at any level, will never talk to American officials ... this is part of their policy to put pressure on Iran,\u201d Iranian state TV quoted Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as saying.\n\nHe said talks could only take place if the United States returned to a nuclear accord between Iran and the West that Trump abandoned last year.\n\nU.S.-Iran relations deteriorated after Trump quit the accord and reimposed sanctions over Tehran\u2019s nuclear and ballistic programmes. He also wants Iran to stop supporting regional proxies, including Yemen\u2019s Houthi group, which has claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nA day after saying the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to respond to the incident, Trump said on Monday there was \u201cno rush\u201d to do so. \u201cWe have a lot of options but I\u2019m not looking at options right now. We want to find definitively who did this.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia, which has supported tougher U.S. sanctions on Iran, said on Monday an initial investigation showed the strikes were carried out with Iranian weapons, but provided no evidence. Riyadh said it was capable of \u201cresponding forcefully\u201d but did not directly accuse Tehran.\n\nThe assault halved Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil output and damaged the world\u2019s biggest crude oil processing plant, triggering the largest jump in oil prices in decades. It was the worst such attack on regional oil facilities since Saddam Hussein torched Kuwait\u2019s oil wells during the 1990-91 Gulf war.\n\nThe Saudi energy minister is due to hold a news conference on Tuesday at 1715 GMT, giving what would be the first update since Aramco, the state oil company, announced on Sunday that attacks on its facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais had knocked out 5.7 million barrels per day.\n\nIt could take months for Saudi production to resume, sources briefed on Aramco\u2019s operations said after earlier estimates put it at weeks.\n\nOil prices surged nearly 20% on Monday after the attack on the world\u2019s top oil exporter, which has been the supplier of last resort for decades. Prices fell after the United States said it would release U.S. emergency supplies and producers said there were enough global stocks.\n\nRiyadh said it would meet oil customers\u2019 demand from its ample storage. Aramco informed at least six refiners in Asia it would supply all allocated crude volumes in October.\n\nDollar-denominated bonds issued by the Saudi government and Aramco rebounded on Tuesday, in a sign that investors\u2019 concern may be abating.\n\nAramco, the world\u2019s largest oil company, is preparing for an initial public offering, although some investors and analysts think it may be delayed as it has not said when oil output will be restored.\n\nLAUNCH SITE\n\nTrump said he was sending Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia soon, but he had not made any commitments to protect the Saudis. \u201cThat was an attack on Saudi Arabia, and that wasn\u2019t an attack on us. But we would certainly help them.\u201d\n\nRiyadh asked international experts to join its investigation, which so far indicates the attack was not launched from Yemen as the Houthis claimed, the foreign ministry said, adding the launch site was still being determined. U.S. officials say they believe the attacks came from the opposite direction, possibly from Iran itself.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani said the strikes were conducted by Yemenis retaliating for attacks by a Saudi-led coalition that has been battling the Houthis for four years. Riyadh says Tehran arms the group that has launched missile and drone strikes on Saudi cities, a charge both deny.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Smoke is seen following a fire at Aramco facility in the eastern city of Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia, September 14, 2019. REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo/File Photo\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, a Saudi ally, said Rouhani\u2019s attempt to \u201cjustify the unprecedented terrorist attack\u201d was unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThe attack on Saudi Arabia is a dangerous escalation in itself,\u201d Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash tweeted.\n\nTehran has warned that if it cannot export oil then neither can other producers. But it has denied involvement in earlier attacks on tankers in Gulf waters and Saudi energy assets, which Washington and Riyadh publicly blamed on Iran.", "description": "Iran's supreme leader on Tuesday ruled out talks with Washington after President Donald Trump blamed Tehran for an attack on Saudi oil facilities that knocked out half the kingdom's output.", "authors": ["Parisa Hafezi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430813761&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0TJ", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
