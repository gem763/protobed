But Trump May Get in the Way.", "language": "en", "text": "White House officials strongly denied that the Gallagher case was discussed. But hours after the meeting, the Chief of Naval Operations announced that he would personally take over the Gallagher case from another admiral, who had indicated that she planned to punish the chief.\n\nThe Navy had also planned to discipline two other SEALs who had come under investigation in the Gallagher case: Lt. Jacob Portier, who was charged with not reporting Chief Gallagher\u2019s actions in Iraq; and Special Operator First Class Corey Scott, a platoon medic whose testimony at the chief\u2019s trial prompted the Navy to open a perjury investigation. But on the same day as the White House meeting, the charges against Lieutenant Portier were dropped and the investigation of Special Operator Scott was ended.\n\nThe intervention from Washington left Navy leaders with a dilemma: Not punishing Chief Gallagher and the others would undermine efforts to restore discipline in the ranks, but punishing them only to be publicly reversed might make things even worse.\n\n\u201cAll that\u2019s off the table now,\u201d said a Navy Special Warfare officer who was briefed on the most recent deliberations of Admiral Green\u2019s team about the matter. Navy commanders grew concerned that if they took away from Chief Gallagher the Trident pin that signifies membership in the SEALs, only to see the president give it back again, the officer said, \u201cit sends a message that the commanders aren\u2019t in control.\u201d\n\nWhile taking no action against Chief Gallagher, the Navy recently fired two senior leaders of the team on which Chief Gallagher serves, SEAL Team 7, which has had other recent incidents of misconduct. The command cited a \u201closs of confidence that resulted from leadership failures.\u201d\n\nThe two leaders, Cmdr. Edward Mason and Master Chief Hugh Spangler \u2014 both decorated career SEALs with unblemished records who took command of the team after Chief Gallagher had been arrested \u2014 filed a complaint with the Navy\u2019s inspector general over their firing. They said that they had become \u201cexpendable scapegoats\u201d in the admiral\u2019s fight against an anti-authoritarian \u201cGallagher effect\u201d that was threatening to spread through the force.\n\nWith his new, protected status, Chief Gallagher appears to be trolling Navy leadership.\n\nA few days after the demoted leaders filed their complaint, an Instagram account belonging to Chief Gallagher and his wife started selling T-shirts emblazoned with the phrase \u201cThe Gallagher Effect.\u201d", "description": "A push to strengthen discipline in the SEAL teams has been stymied by one sailor\u2019s support in the White House.", "authors": ["Dave Philipps"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/us/00seals/00seals-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
