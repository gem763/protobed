He\u2019s focused on the much longer term, he says, not the minute-by-minute price action.\n\nAnd yet, three months into an ugly selloff that has wiped out about two-thirds of the faux-meat maker\u2019s valuation, Brown is noticeably defensive about the two main criticisms his company keeps hearing: that his products aren\u2019t healthy and competition is swarming. On an earnings call last night and again in an hour-long interview at Bloomberg News headquarters in New York, Brown spent long patches talking about both.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re in the business of doing, and this is an area where the headlines have to get straight with the facts: We are building a piece of meat directly from plants,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cWhen you do that, you can make it healthier than the conventional meat.\u201d\n\nThe trick is convincing investors that the Beyond Meat story isn\u2019t a fad or part of a plant-based bubble waiting to pop. The stock cratered as much as 24% Tuesday to the lowest since late May after a restriction on insider selling came to an end the day after third-quarter earnings raised questions about rising competition, fears of slower growth ahead and higher operational costs.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Carnage\n\nThe selloff, which followed a frenzied rally that drove the stock up as much as 840% back in July, has been sparked primarily by concern about new competitors, plus insider-selling restrictions ending, giving shareholders their first real chance to cash in. It hit that milestone on Tuesday, when about 46 million shares became eligible for sale.\n\nOn the earnings call, Chairman Seth Goldman tried to reassure investors about the company\u2019s long-term prospects, while acknowledging the lockup expiry may cause some short-term volatility. Brown, Beyond\u2019s fifth-largest holder, said Tuesday that he won\u2019t sell his shares anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWhy would I?\u201d Brown said in the interview. The executive was one of the holders who took advantage of an early secondary offering in July to sell some shares. The other four top investors have either declined to comment or haven\u2019t returned requests for comment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m entirely focused on long term,\u201d Brown said. Beyond Meat can be \u201ca $40 billion global protein company.\u201d\n\n\u2018Let the Competition Come\u2019\n\nStill, some investors are wary. New rivals are entering the imitation-meat space at a rapid clip, with products emerging from the likes of old-guard food companies Nestle SA, Conagra Brands Inc. and Hormel Foods Corp., just to name a few. Then there\u2019s Impossible Foods Inc., another hot startup making inroads into both American grocery stores and fast-food franchises.\n\nShareholders may be sweating, but Brown says he sees plenty of room to grow. Beyond\u2019s household penetration is only 2% right now, up 66% for the year, with lots of new hires in the company\u2019s marketing department to keep pushing the company forward.\n\nCompetition is \u201cnothing new,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want good competitors, in the sense that it drives our team. We\u2019re going to replace our own products; you\u2019re not going to replace them. Let the competition come.\u201d\n\nThe advantage the Big Food rivals have, he conceded, is they\u2019re already, well, so big. But he thinks the score, so far anyway, shows that Beyond is winning. \u201cThey could flex their muscles on distribution,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to imagine they did that with McDonald\u2019s, they did that with Subway and others\u201d -- and both of those chains still opted to use Beyond Meat in their recent plant-based trials.\n\n\u2018Tale of Two Processes\u2019\n\nIf there\u2019s one recurring critique of Beyond Meat and its growing slew of competitors, it\u2019s that imitation meat is an overly processed food that shouldn\u2019t be regarded as healthy. Brown\u2019s trying to fight that, too, rather than appeal to the Soylent crowd that he says is more drawn to rival Impossible.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of noise around that -- \u2018processed\u2019 -- and I find it interesting. It\u2019s an indication we have to educate the consumer around this,\u201d he said, arguing that building animal muscle from the plants the cow eats is actually a more complicated process than generating plant-based alternatives. \u201cIt\u2019s a tale of two processes: We produce meat by pulling the protein and fats directly from the plants. Instead of running it through the animal, we go through a system of heating, cooling and pressure.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Ethan Brown, the CEO of Beyond Meat Inc., likes to talk about how little attention he pays to the wild gyrations of his company\u2019s stock.
