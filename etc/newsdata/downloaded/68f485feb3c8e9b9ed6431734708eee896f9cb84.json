John, who spent 20 years in the Navy and completed tours in Kuwait and Somalia, said he suffers from Huntington's disease, which is a fatal genetic disorder characterized by the breakdown of nerves in the brain according to the Huntington's Disease Society of America.\n\nDramatic moment here at @BernieSanders rally.

I'm gonna kill myself,\" he said.\n\nThe 2020 presidential hopeful immediately interrupted him and sought to calm the veteran down.\n\n\"Hold it, John, stop it,\" Sanders said. \"You're not going to kill yourself.\"\n\nSanders then reportedly told John that the two would discuss his situation after the town hall.\n\n\"I wish that I could say that what John just described is unique and that he is the only person in America who undergoes that, but it's not,\" Sanders said after the veteran shared his story. \"So John, we'll talk about it after the meeting, and we'll see what we can do about it.\"\n\nVeterans can lose their Tricare coverage for a number of reasons, including separation from service, loss of eligibility due to age and change in marital status, according to the program's website. Moreover, approximately 20 veterans commit suicide in the U.S. every day, CBS News notes.\n\nClick here to learn about the warning signs of suicide.
