A sceptic lets herself be put under his spell\n\nAt the Illusionist\u2019s Table had its international performances reviewed so glowingly I couldn\u2019t help wondering if my fellow journalists had been bought, since tickets for the Melbourne festival adaptation go for $399. Could being trapped in a room for two hours with a mentalist really equate to such good times?\n\nImagining some abracadabra, and possibly even some reach-out-and-grab-ya, I steel myself by visualising the promised three-course meal with matched drinks.\n\nTonight\u2019s a preview, with guests including government ministers (themselves masters of illusion, some might say) and festival sponsors, and thus the atmosphere as we wait to enter is formal, even with the addition of champagne. But as we\u2019re let into the Chapter House of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, I\u2019m suddenly overcome by a sense of calm.\n\nRite of Spring review \u2013 erotic and mesmerising tale of sacrifice with a Buddhist twist Read more\n\nThe Victorian gothic space has tonight been further cloistered with the addition of heavy black drapes. One long banqueting table is set for 24 guests, with long, tapered candles and branches adorning the heavy linen tablecloth. It would seem quite like a s\u00e9ance, but for the 1930s jazz playing. Illusionist Scott Silven has created a world within a world.\n\nSilven \u2013 young, classically suited \u2013 sits silently at the head of the table. When everyone is settled, he begins to tell a meandering story from his childhood (allegedly), which becomes a motif of the evening, resumed between courses.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Scott Silven\u2019s use of storytelling and setting creates something genuinely magical. Photograph: Alice Boreas\n\nAs well as seeding certain words and images into our unconscious for his later skulduggery, Silven\u2019s narrative about relying on his senses to find his way out of a forest serves the purpose of setting up our belief in our own powers, to the extent that he suggests we might even be able to communicate psychically with each other. Since the tools he uses to imbue this are whisky tasting (he\u2019s a Scot, after all), mood lighting and the palette of flavours on our plates, I\u2019m on board.\n\nSilven uses distraction, suggestion and the reading of body language and tone of voice to effortlessly concoct his mind-trickery, correctly identifying numbers, words and drawings produced by the diners. He\u2019s also equipped with an incredible memory, never stumbling over the name of any guest, nor anything they\u2019ve said earlier.\n\nOne whisky-clutching guest, asked to come to the head of the table and draw on a blackboard, takes advantage of their turn in the spotlight to unsportingly complain of Silven\u2019s patter: \u201cHe does go on, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d But then, as the complex illusion suddenly bears fruit, they themselves are silenced.\n\nSilven grew up in Hamilton in the central lowlands of Scotland, and found a mentor in the owner of a magic shop in Glasgow. As a teenager he took a hypnosis course in Milan, and then studied drama and performance at the University of Edinburgh. Later in the evening, he tells Guardian Australia that he\u2019s partly inspired by the films of Hitchcock and Lynch when it comes to creating a mood.\n\nHe performed this show at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival for years, and sold out a 12-week run in New York. Unsurprisingly, then, he has every last detail planned immaculately. The award-winning culinary team at Sofitel Melbourne On Collins provides the feast, which includes venison under a cloche lid and seafood, while the hotel events team were given precise descriptions of what tablecloths and glassware were acceptable.\n\nThe Shadow Whose Prey the Hunter Becomes review \u2013 theatre that's anything but sweet Read more\n\nTwo lines of well-starched wait staff smoothly present each dish to each guest in unison, and touches such as glass bottles with pipettes to dilute our whisky instil a sense of ritual largely missing from modern lives.\n\nSilven\u2019s use of storytelling and setting creates something genuinely magical, and it\u2019s a joy to willingly suspend disbelief and slide into a sense of wonder not experienced since childhood.\n\nAnd with that comes connection. Not the psychic kind Silven suggests, but the kind forged by a shared sense of discovery. Across the table, eyes are shining, guards are down, and there\u2019s the odd report of goosebumps. The childhood game of Chinese whispers, further confounded by whisky, brings things to a delightfully silly finish.\n\nI emerge still a sceptic, but certainly not a cynic.\n\n\u2022 Scott Silven\u2019s shows At the Illusionist\u2019s Table and Wonders are showing at Melbourne International Arts Festival", "description": "Could being trapped in a room for two hours with a Scottish magician really be that riveting?
