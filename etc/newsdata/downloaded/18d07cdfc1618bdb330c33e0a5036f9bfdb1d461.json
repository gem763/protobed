Rand Paul (R-KY) is out with a new book, The Case Against Socialism, and explained his case and vision in a lengthy exclusive interview on Sirius XM\u2019s Breitbart News Sunday this weekend.\n\nIn the interview, Paul said that from Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime in Germany to Josef Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union to Mao Zedong\u2019s China to Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba to Pol Pot\u2019s Cambodia to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s Venezuela, socialism has worse than failed in every single country it has been attempted. And while he says that modern American socialists like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) claim \u201cthey don\u2019t want that kind of socialism\u201d that results in \u201cauthoritarianism, genocide, and famine,\u201d there is no case where socialism has ever worked and it always ends up there.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s one of the questions that comes up very quickly is some people are incredulous you even have to make the case because history is replete with examples of socialism gone awry, socialism devolving into authoritarianism, genocide, and famine,\u201d Paul said in a half-hour special that aired Sunday evening on Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel.\n\n\u201cThe 20th century really is the history of the failure of socialism, from Hitler\u2019s Nazi or nationalist socialism to Stalin\u2019s Bolshevik socialism to Mao\u2019s socialism to Pol Pot. Really, time and time again, millions of people have died at the hands of despotic rulers,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSome would say today\u2019s socialists like AOC and Bernie don\u2019t want that kind of socialism, but actually there was a time when Bernie was very sympathetic to Castro as well as Ch\u00e1vez. This seems to be the pattern for today\u2019s socialists is that they\u2019re very, very open to socialism until they find out that it\u2019s replaced by authoritarianism and until they find out it\u2019s been replaced by poverty.\u201d\n\nPaul points to Venezuela as a key recent historical example of socialism \u201cgone awry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is true in Venezuela in particular,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAll the American left was in love, even people who didn\u2019t claim to be socialists, were in love Ch\u00e1vez and claimed he was reducing poverty, but in the end in Venezuela it\u2019s become so desperate that the average person has lost 20 pounds not because they intended to but for lack of food. Venezuela was once one of the richest countries\u2014probably the richest country\u2014in South America. They still have more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia, but there\u2019s still shortages of food. The common people can\u2019t eat. You see people like their leader, Maduro\u2014their socialist leader\u2014becoming more and more overweight; he\u2019s probably added something like 50 pounds while the average person is losing 20 pounds. So I think you see example after example of socialism not working and devolving into state violence, but I think even more important though is we now\u2014you think most people would know that, but what we have now is polls showing people today, especially youth, think socialism might be a good idea. You have some polls showing over 50 percent of young people thinking we ought to try socialism. So my wife and I got together and wrote this book thinking gosh, we have to remind them of the history of socialism, but we also have to remind them that socialism historically has also devolved into violence.\u201d\n\nSocialism, Paul argues, has taken over the Democrat Party, fueled by an angry presidential primary battle that has resulted in a \u201cbidding war\u201d of sorts between that party\u2019s leaders attempting to outdo each other.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s become a kind of a bidding war among the presidential candidates on the Democrat side,\u201d Paul said. \u201cOne person will offer free college, and the other person will say, \u2018No, free college and free benefits for paid leave,\u2019 and then another one will say, \u2018What about Medicare for All?\u2019 So it just goes on and on and on, in sort of a bidding war on the left for who can offer more free stuff. But there needs to be an examination of who really pays for so-called \u2018free stuff.\u2019 This is one of the big lies we point out in The Case Against Socialism, is that Bernie and AOC say, \u2018Oh the top one percent will pay for all this.\u2019 But when you add it up, there\u2019s just not enough money. What they have proposed on the top one percent would maybe bring in $50 billion, but their spending desires are closer to $60, $70, or even $80 trillion. So there\u2019s definitely a mismatch and a math problem for these people.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the mathematical and historical issues with socialism, Paul argues, current socialists using Scandinavian countries like Denmark and Sweden to argue socialism works are false analogies.\n\n\u201cBut even worse, they point to the so-called socialism of Scandinavia and say, \u2018Oh yeah, we used to like Ch\u00e1vez, we used to like Castro, we used to like the Sandinistas, but now what we really like is Scandinavian socialism,\u2019\u201d Paul said. \u201cSo we examine that, my wife and I did a great deal of research and we examined Scandinavian socialism and what we came up with is interestingly they are not socialist. They have private property; most of the businesses are owned privately. They have a private stock exchange. In fact, the prime minister of Denmark when Bernie kept saying, \u2018Denmark is this great socialist nation,\u2019 the prime minister actually came out and said, \u2018Bernie, you need to pipe down; we\u2019re not a socialist country.\u2019 In fact, he almost got alarm in his voice because he was worried people might not come there to do business anymore because they might think they were a socialist nation. Most of the indexes of freedom, trade, and capitalism actually rank the Scandinavian countries quite high. So really what Bernie is selling is a bill of goods here. They will then argue that the Scandinavian countries have a lot of free stuff\u2014they do have a lot of free stuff, welfare, and state goodies that come with big government, but the interesting thing with Scandinavia is it\u2019s much different than Bernie and AOC say. What happens in Scandinavia is the working class pay a huge amount of taxes. The working class pay a 25 percent sales tax on everything, including food, and the working class and middle class also pay income tax, whereas many in our country on the lower end are excluded from the income tax, whereas what you find over there is even at $60,000 you have a 60 percent income tax. So, really, I think it\u2019s important that we explode the myths of American socialists that Scandinavia is socialist but also explode the myth that you can have all this free stuff and the only people that pay are the top one percent in America. There\u2019s just not enough money, and it\u2019s just not true.\u201d\n\nPaul is troubled by a rising interest in socialism among America\u2019s youth, as evidenced by some increased support for the radical and failed ideology in recent polling, and is concerned that American young people are not learning this history in school. While he thinks some of it is just a natural tradition of Americans being more leftist when they are young and becoming more conservative as they get older, he is concerned that some of what is happening is due to a lack of education on the historical failures of socialism and misconception about what socialism really entails\u2014government control of the means of production.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s always been a trend for young people to be more liberal\u2014or more open to socialism\u2014you know the old saying was, \u2018If you don\u2019t believe in liberal policies before age 30 you don\u2019t have a heart, but if you don\u2019t believe in conservative polices after age 30 you don\u2019t have a brain,\u2019\u201d Paul said. \u201cThere is some truth to it. When you\u2019re younger, you live on your parents\u2019 dole. In many ways, you are a dependent who has not necessarily seen the working world or seen what it\u2019s like and seen that paying taxes is necessary. So I do think people become more conservative over time. It\u2019s also true that the polls that show younger people and millennials leaning toward socialism, when they ask these young people \u2018What is socialism?\u2019 only 16 or 17 percent of them can actually answer what socialism is and socialism is traditionally defined as the state owning the means of production and you don\u2019t have private property\u2014there is collective ownership of things. For most young people, if they\u2019re just reading one sentence on Twitter, I guess they\u2019re not reading much history. Some of it is a misconception, but some of it also is a function of our schools in that I think there\u2019s a sort of unified groupthink in schools that teaches kids that things are sort of unfair out there and that it\u2019s a rotten world and the government is going to make things more equal and more fair. So I think some of them want to see government-enforced equality, but we make the case in The Case Against Socialism that if you want equality of outcomes you would have to have equality police.\u201d\n\nPaul further explains the left\u2019s hypocrisy when it comes to a \u201cfairness police\u201d that he says would be necessary under a socialist system to ensure \u201cequal outcome\u201d by noting that it cuts against core American beliefs of \u201cequal protection under the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would have to have a fairness police that is going to show up with truncheons to make people fair again because any time you sort of advocate for equal outcome you basically push to make everyone equal all the time, the world is not that way,\u201d Paul said. \u201cYou have unequal talents, some people work harder than others, some people are luckier, some people are taller, some people are smarter, some people are faster\u2014there\u2019s all kinds of reasons why there are not equal outcomes. But the irony is if you want to have equal outcomes the law and the government actually has to treat people unequally. You think the left would think this through, and they would realize that the whole idea of equal protection under the law\u2014that everybody should be treated the same\u2014is a principle that the left prided themselves in and almost everyone prides themselves in now and yet if you have equal outcomes you won\u2019t have equal protection under the law. You actually will have to law that will treat people in an unequal way.\u201d\n\nPart of why Paul said there is a rush to socialism in America\u2019s youth is a legitimate concern with political corruption in America, something grassroots movements on both the left and the right have felt for many years. There is, he said, a political, cultural, and financial elite that seems to ordinary Americans to be above the rest of society when it comes to the law and because of that corruption people challenge the system\u2014on both sides of the political aisle. He is concerned, however, that the left\u2019s pandering with socialism would only make the system worse because it would empower more cronyism and more corruption if ever implemented, whereas conservatives\u2019 vision of less government cuts into the ability of bad actors to act badly.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve hit the nail on the head. Both left and right, the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movement, they\u2019re all sort of unhappy about\u2014myself included\u2014about crony capitalism, about people who manipulate government and manipulate the law to have an unfair advantage,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that they\u2019re selling something that people want and have become successful like Sam Walton, it\u2019s things like some of the big pharmaceutical companies and things that come to Washington and manipulate government to enrich themselves and then abuse the rules to enrich themselves more and more. So yes I think both sides\u2014both right and left\u2014see this. I remember when the bankers were bailed out in 2009, these very wealthy bankers and very wealthy banks that had made rotten decisions. In the end, the poor homeowner was kicked out of his house or her house but the banks were bailed out. So the Occupy Wall Street movement was offended by that and so was the Tea Party. The real difference is the answer. It\u2019s one thing to be angry about crony capitalism. For those on the left, it\u2019s because crony capitalism is a failure they think we should try socialism. For those of us on the right, or the Tea Party movement, we look at crony capitalism and say that\u2019s too much government\u2014that\u2019s people abusing government.\u201d\n\nPaul added that the right\u2019s vision is more effective in solving the problems of corruption because it takes the power away from that handful of people who would wield it dishonorably. And that is exactly the problem with socialism, he said, as evidenced by all its historical failures: Bad actors rise up and inevitably wield said power unfairly in what ends up benefitting the few at the top and screwing over the many throughout society.\n\n\u201cWe decided that what we wanted was less government, more of a government restrained and restricted and limited by the Constitution and less crony capitalism in a sense that what we wanted to inject was more of a free market and more voluntary transactions,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSo it is sort of ironic that both right and left are both motivated by the same problem we see, and they come up with very different solutions and I think that\u2019s why the book we have The Case Against Socialism is so important is because it\u2019s about choices. It\u2019s about voters in our country who get to think about what kind of economic system we want. And I guess our point in the book is we don\u2019t think it\u2019s an accident that throughout history every time socialism has been tried it has wound up in genocide and famine. The stories from Mao\u2019s China, the stories from Pol Pot in Cambodia, the stories currently from Venezuela, I mean they are horrifying stories. People are eating their pets in Venezuela. People need to know this. The other side will complain and say that\u2019s not real socialism, that\u2019s a bunch of kleptocrats. And yet that\u2019s the people who are elected, that\u2019s their party label\u2014they are from the socialist party\u2014and again the apologists for socialism say \u2018oh that\u2019s not what we really want. These people now are just thugs.\u2019 But why is it time and time again socialism devolves into thuggery? So, I think this is an important and timely book and I hope it will get the readership necessary to shape and influence some of the next generation.\u201d\n\nPaul added that he\u2019s looked at experts and historical analysis to question whether socialism inevitably ends up in authoritarian regimes intent on genocide and famine, or if that just keeps happening accidentally. He argues that the experts like Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek have examined this very question and found that under socialism, ruthlessness prevails in leadership and violence becomes necessary for implementation.\n\n\u201cPeople keep getting back to this idea of whether it\u2019s an inevitability to have this kind of authoritarianism and violence or whether it\u2019s an accident,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHayek and others looked at this, and they said it shouldn\u2019t be looked at as a one-off or accidental in history that socialism devolves into violence because if you ultimately want to collectivize the farms as Mao did or Stalin did, if you want to take property from people, there is a point at which they will resist. Really, the leader that exhibits that most ruthless character is the one who\u2019s able to take the land because it ultimately does require, as Lenin and others said, you\u2019ve got to break a few eggs to make an omelette. The thing is is ultimately this is what happens. You end up choosing a few leaders; they get selected by the rest of the socialists because they are the most ruthless and willing to actually use the violence necessary to take the property. But really, our kids need to learn this history and read about it. Pol Pot was not that long ago in Cambodia with the killing fields and just hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of bodies piled in mass graves. In a very short period of time they expelled virtually everybody from the cities and ultimately millions of people were killed. This is the kind of thing that people say, \u2018Oh that\u2019s not what I want.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut, Paul argues, if Americans vote for socialist leadership, what ultimately happens next is evident throughout history.\n\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re for socialism, if you\u2019re for the collectivization of ownership, if you believe that the collective is more important than the individual, ultimately this is what happens,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think the individual is important and you disdain individual rights, then it\u2019s sort of like it\u2019s okay to have drone-like slaves because then what you\u2019re about is the hive and you\u2019re not really concerned about the individual. Our country was founded on something completely different, individual liberty. Our bill of rights is directed toward individuals not toward classifications and these are important traditions but I think it\u2019s not being taught in school. Today\u2019s sort of Twitter society is short attention span and not reading. I think it\u2019s important to have the ammunition out there and we\u2019re hoping that The Case Against Socialism will be that ammunition to help people make an informed decision and hopefully prevent America, as President Trump said, from ever becoming a socialist nation.\u201d\n\nBefore Paul\u2019s interview with Breitbart News, he had appeared on The View opposite, among others, Ana Navarro\u2014the frequent critic of President Donald Trump\u2014who shut Paul down when he was explaining what socialism was and why it was bad and why it failed in Venezuela. Paul, when asked about Navarro\u2019s silencing of him, told Breitbart News that exposing socialism does not fit Navarro\u2019s \u201cnarrative\u201d of hateful opposition to President Trump\u2014something shared by the other hosts of The View\u2014so she would rather just not discuss these inconvenient truths at all.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really fit their narrative,\u201d Paul said. \u201cPeople like Ana Navarro hate President Trump and they blame everything and they blame the poor dialogue and crassness in Washington and crass dialogue between right and left\u2014they blame it all on the president, and yet really people like Ana Navarro and others on The View who shout and scream over everybody, really they\u2019re adding to that poor dialogue. They\u2019re setting a poor example for everyone with the sort of yelling and screaming, but the particular point we were trying to explain to her was the leaders in Venezuela are socialist. The leaders of their party identify as the socialist party. She was like, \u2018No they\u2019re thugs, they\u2019re thugs. They\u2019re not socialists.\u2019 And I tried to calmly make the point to her that, well, they are socialists and they are thugs\u2014and that\u2019s precisely our point. When the government is controlled centrally by a few people, by one political party\u2014the socialists\u2014and you get central planning where you don\u2019t have the freedom to decide what and how much to produce and consumers don\u2019t get to choose, when a few people control things, you have much more of a susceptibility to kleptocracy, to thieves, to stealing and lying and enriching yourselves.\u201d\n\nPaul added that leftist anti-Trump personalities like Navarro \u201cdemean themselves\u201d by opposing allowing \u201cintelligent debate\u201d on these issues.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what keeps happening [socialism failing] over and over again, and that\u2019s what she doesn\u2019t understand and so many on the left refuse to understand is that there is a tendency or maybe even something that is inherent to socialism that leads to thuggery,\u201d Paul said. \u201cPeople like her don\u2019t want to see the lessons of Mao, the lessons of Stalin, the lessons of Hitler\u2014they weren\u2019t accidents of history, they were the natural conclusion of socialism. Maduro and Ch\u00e1vez are the natural conclusion to socialism. Then she was like, \u2018Oh, President Trump is misusing this and saying that if the Democrats win you\u2019ll get socialism.\u2019 Then I said, and I don\u2019t think she liked it, I said, \u2018You know, if you vote for a socialist you might get socialism.\u2019 And it\u2019s like really? That sounds obvious to me. Bernie says he is a socialist\u2014I think we\u2019d get socialism [if he wins]. AOC says she\u2019s a socialist. I would think we might socialism if these people ever get in charge of the government. So it\u2019s sort of a bizarre situation, but they sort of demean themselves by being intolerant of allowing intelligent debate.\u201d\n\nWhile much of the interview focused on the issues of socialism and Sanders in particular, Paul added that the new Democrat frontrunner Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is really no different than Sanders when it comes to socialist ideology\u2014just that she\u2019s better at hiding it from the public than Sanders which is why she\u2019s ascendant in the polls.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s really not a dime\u2019s worth of difference between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThey stand for the same policies and ultimately hers is a socialist platform also. You\u2019re right, though, she\u2019s like most liberals of the last several decades where they were always smart to try to hide their socialism from the public. And I think in the end, most of the major policies that have come out\u2014Elizabeth Warren has rushed to support. So I don\u2019t know that you can claim, maintain, or support that there\u2019s much of a difference in policies between Bernie Sanders\u2019 socialism and Elizabeth Warren.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly troubling, though, Paul said, is the evidence that socialism has won the day inside the Democrat Party as a whole. Ocasio-Cortez is now calling the shots and really running the House of Representatives now, not Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as evidenced by the Democrats\u2019 lunging towards impeachment of President Trump. How the media and political class have gone after President Trump, versus the kid glove treatment of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, is exactly the kind of unfair double standard that Paul argues leads people to question the fairness of the political and economic system in America.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re off the reservation now as far as impeachment goes,\u201d Paul said. \u201c[Pelosi] announced she was for it before she saw any transcripts of the phone call. And, the way I see it is I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody from either party who hasn\u2019t threatened Ukraine\u2019s aid and told them they have to investigate corruption. [Former Vice President Joe] Biden was there threatening it years ago, if they didn\u2019t quit investigating his son\u2019s company\u2014the company that was paying him $50,000 a month\u2014I think most Americans, when they hear that, just on the face of it, that some 30-year-old kid is on the board of an international company getting $50,000 a month, and his dad is traveling to Ukraine all the time, and his dad sort of tells them, \u2018Guess what, you get no more money unless you fire this prosecutor.\u2019 The prosecutor has actually now testified that he was investigating the company that was paying Hunter Biden. It just doesn\u2019t pass the smell test. People are going to wonder and say, \u2018Well, Pelosi is going to impeach the president over accusations he did something like this even though it doesn\u2019t sound like he was willing to trade or do anything.\u2019 But even if the accusations were accurate, they sound very similar to what Biden\u2019s been accused of but yet nobody blinked an eye or accused Biden of doing something untoward that he should be impeached for. But I think the American people ultimately do want fairness, and they\u2019re going to balk at treating Trump differently than Biden is treated. So if the American people perceive the actions of both to be similar, but that the Democrats are only willing to go after a Republican, I think it ends up becoming a partisan thing that I think people in the end are going to think was motivated by politics not by principle or justice.\u201d\n\nPaul added that this double standard is exactly why Americans on both sides of the aisle are \u201cdisturbed\u201d by America\u2019s political, financial, and cultural elites. He also explained that the ultimate irony of all this kleptocracy by the Bidens is that it has cleared the way for the rise of Warren, a socialist herself, and the question is whether she will be able to sufficiently hide her socialism.\n\n\u201cPeople get disturbed by it on both sides,\u201d Paul said. \u201cReally, they get disturbed by what\u2019s going on. But, I think really that ultimately it\u2019s going to be very, very hard and the irony is that while they thought this was going to bring Trump down, the irony is this is bringing Biden down. His numbers were already falling because he doesn\u2019t seem to be on the ball as much as he used to, he doesn\u2019t seem to have maybe what it takes to intellectually get through the questions of the day during the debates, and so I think that was already bringing him down but the association with the scandal and his son and all the money that went to his son, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s bringing him down. I agree with you that Elizabeth Warren is surging to the top, and the question will be: Will she run away from all the stuff she supports with Bernie, ultimately, or will the tag of socialism and the stain of socialism stick to her as well? We plan on being out there and talking about socialism over the next year and making the actual positions of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are well known and that the disaster of socialism is something our kids will hopefully know enough about to resist it.\u201d\n\nLISTEN TO RAND PAUL ON BREITBART NEWS SUNDAY:", "description": "Sen.
