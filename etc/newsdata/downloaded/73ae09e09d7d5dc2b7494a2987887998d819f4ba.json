The Turkish air strikes killed at least five civilians and three fighters from the SDF and wounded dozens of civilians, the SDF said.\n\nReuters journalists at Akcakale on the Turkish side of the frontier watched as explosions struck Tel Abyad. After dark, the red flare of rockets could be seen fired across the border into Tel Abyad, and flames burned near the town. Explosions from Tel Abyad could be heard eight hours into the bombardment. A witness reached by telephone said civilians were fleeing en masse.\n\nSDF fighters repelled a ground attack by Turkish troops in Tel Abyad, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said on Twitter.\n\nThe assault on the Kurds - for years Washington\u2019s main allies on the ground in Syria - is potentially one of the biggest shifts in years in the Syrian war that has drawn in global and regional powers. The Kurds played a leading role in capturing territory from Islamic State, and now hold the largest swathe of Syria outside of the hands of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nRussia, Assad\u2019s strongest foreign ally, urged dialogue between Damascus and Syria\u2019s Kurds.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to pull forces out of the way was denounced by some Kurds as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d.\n\n\u2018BAD IDEA\u2019\n\nTrump called the Turkish assault a \u201cbad idea\u201d and said he did not endorse it. He expected Turkey to protect civilians and religious minorities and prevent a humanitarian crisis, he said.\n\nBut one of Trump\u2019s closest fellow Republican allies, Senator Lindsey Graham, said failing to support the Kurds would be \u201cthe biggest mistake of his presidency\u201d.\n\nRepresentative Liz Cheney, a Republican hawk, said: \u201cThe U.S. is abandoning our ally the Kurds, who fought ISIS (Islamic State) on the ground and helped protect the U.S. homeland. This decision aids America\u2019s adversaries, Russia, Iran, and Turkey, and paves the way for a resurgence of ISIS.\u201d\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan, announcing the start of the action, said the aim was to eliminate what he called a \u201cterror corridor\u201d on Turkey\u2019s southern border.\n\nEuropean and Arab countries called on Ankara to halt.\n\nTurkey had been poised to enter northeast Syria since the U.S. troops who had been fighting alongside Kurdish-led forces against Islamic State started to leave.\n\nSmoke rises from the Syrian border town of Ras al-Ain as it is pictured from the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 9, 2019. REUTERS/Stringer\n\nA Turkish security source told Reuters the military offensive, dubbed \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d, opened with air strikes. Turkish howitzer fire then hit bases and ammunition depots of the Kurdish YPG militia. Turkey says the YPG, the main component of the U.S.-backed SDF, is a terrorist group linked to Kurdish insurgents that have fought in Turkey for years.\n\nThe artillery strikes, which also targeted YPG gun and sniper positions, were aimed at sites far from residential areas, the Turkish source said.\n\nThe Turkish army has hit a total of 181 militant targets with air strikes and howitzers since the start of the operation, the defence ministry said on Wednesday.\n\nExplosions also rocked the Syrian border town of Ras al Ain, according to a reporter for CNN Turk. The sound of warplanes could be heard above and smoke rose from buildings in the town, the CNN reporter said.\n\nTurkish media said several mortar shells had landed on the Turkish side of the border but there were no casualties.\n\nWORSE TURMOIL\n\nWorld powers fear the Turkish action could open a new chapter in Syria\u2019s war and worsen regional turmoil. Ankara has said it intends to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d in order to return millions of refugees to Syrian soil.\n\nIn the build-up to the offensive, Syria had said it was determined to confront any Turkish aggression.\n\nThe SDF controls much of the territory that once was held by Islamic State and holds thousands of Islamic State fighters and tens of thousands of their relatives in detention.\n\nIt halted operations against Islamic State because of the Turkish offensive, two U.S. officials and a Kurdish source said.\n\nSlideshow (21 Images)\n\nOne of the prisons where ISIS detainees are held was struck by a Turkish air strike, the SDF said on Twitter.\n\nThe Kurdish-led authority in northern Syria declared a state of \u201cgeneral mobilisation\u201d before calling on its people to head towards the border \u201cto fulfil their moral duty and show resistance in these sensitive, historic moments\u201d.\n\nErdogan\u2019s communications director Fahrettin Altun said Turkey had no ambition in northeastern Syria except to neutralise the threat against Turkish citizens and to liberate the local people from what he called \u201cthe yoke of armed thugs\u201d.\n\nTurkey was taking over leadership of the fight against Islamic State in Syria, he said.", "description": "Turkish troops and their Syrian rebel allies attacked Kurdish militia in northeast Syria on Wednesday, pounding them with air strikes and artillery before starting a cross-border ground operation that could transform an eight-year-old war.", "authors": ["Mert Ozkan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438994290&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF98213", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
