The ANC and its allies had agreed to hold this meeting just before Mboweni's paper was published.\n\nREAD | Cosatu to Mboweni: Withdraw your incoherent, confused and unreliable plan to bolster economy\n\nMboweni told the NEC that government's choices were becoming starker and that urgent changes were needed.\n\nThe finance minister said growth was faltering and tax revenue had been disappointing, despite tax and VAT increases.\n\nHe also said state-owned enterprises posed a massive risk to the country's economic stability.\n\nOne of the NEC members said that while there was no great debate over the state of Eskom, there seemed to be an agreement that it remained a liability and there was still a need to unpack the restructuring of the electricity provider.\n\n\"Some agreed that it's not viable and, instead of attempting to privatise completely... maybe look for equity,\" said the insider.\n\nThe president was also asked to appeal to Soweto residents to pay Eskom the more than R18m in unpaid bills they owe the utility.\n\nMicro-economic policies\n\nThe NEC member even claimed there were no disagreements on the issue of renewable energy, saying not a single person in that meeting, including leaders from Cosatu and SACP, stood up to reject it.\n\nAnother source said the NEC wanted the proposals to be dealt with urgently and that the document needed to incorporate more micro-economic policies.\n\nA third insider said the major issues were protocol and processes.\n\n\"No decision, no resolution. We want to have some experts appointed to broaden the scope,\" said the ANC leader.\n\n\"We are still consulting, still busy with input,\" added the NEC member.", "description": "The ANC's national executive committee has decided to discuss Finance Minister Tito Mboweni's proposed economic reforms report at a tripartite alliance summit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2855/4b2bb5f8c0cb480088493e1909115c31.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
