Beyond its far-right rhetoric and policies, the League's rise triggered alarm in capitals across the Continent with its ambiguous stance on a potential exit from the euro, its easygoing approach to Italy's staggering public debt and its pro-Kremlin line.\n\nYet there is a danger that the incoming Commission president's favor of an economic portfolio for Italy could backfire.\n\nWith the League sidelined, EU countries are pitching in to help the new executive. Significantly, next week French President Emmanuel Macron will be the first EU leader to visit Rome since the 5Stars-PD government took office. The trip comes after months of tensions between his government and the 5Stars-League coalition.\n\nVon der Leyen has her own reasons to help the new government: Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and the 5Stars were essential to her confirmation, with Conte backing her in the Council and the 5Stars helping to secure her razor-thin majority in the Parliament.\n\nYet there is a danger that the incoming Commission president's favor of an economic portfolio for Italy could backfire. Analysts and PD officials have expressed concern that Gentiloni's job might turn into a trap for the new government if he ends up having to enforce unpopular economic rules or austerity measures.\n\n\u201cIf he is too soft on Italy, he'll be accused by Nordic hawks of favoritism,\u201d as one Italian newspaper put it. \"If he is too hard, he will provide [League leader Matteo] Salvini the occasion to call him and the PD 'slaves of Brussels.'\"\n\nLittle budget flexibility ahead\n\nThe new government is already facing an uphill battle. It's far more popular in Brussels than at home: A survey published by newspaper Corriere della Sera showed that just 36 percent of Italians support the new coalition. The League-5Stars government, on the other hand, had a 61 percent approval rating at the end of July.\n\nTo win over voters, the new government hopes for EU support on two hot-button issues in particular: the budget and migration.\n\nConte, who has repeatedly called for greater flexibility in EU fiscal rules, was careful to reassure less lenient capitals that \u201cour target is to reduce the debt\u201d when he was in Brussels last week to meet with key officials, both incoming and outgoing, in EU institutions.\n\nBut he also said that his government wanted to achieve debt reduction not with austerity but \"through economic growth and investments,\u201d adding that Italy would need \u201csome time\u201d to reach fiscal targets and invest in the green economy, digitalization and the revival of its poorer south, the so-called Mezzogiorno.\n\nYet while Italy might hope for a little more flexibility with Gentiloni in charge of the economic portfolio, the commissioner will likely have little room for maneuver. Austria's Sebastian Kurz, the country's former and likely next chancellor, already announced his opposition to softening budget rules, saying Vienna was \"not prepared to pay Italy's debts.\"\n\nGentiloni will also have to work closely with \u2014 and report to \u2014 Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, a Latvian in charge of economic affairs, who is considered a hawk.\n\n\u201cWe expect von der Leyen to fulfil her promise to put at the center of her program migration and real European policy of managing the flows\u201d \u2014 Laura Ferrara, 5Stars MEP\n\nAt the same time, surveys show that center-left voters are the only Italian demographic with a high amount of trust in Brussels. If Gentiloni ends up becoming the EU's \"austerity man,\" the chances of the PD \u2014 and the new government in general \u2014 halting the rise of the League would likely become even slimmer than they are now.\n\nYet top PD officials seem not to be too worried: Gentiloni is \u201cone of the most prestigious names in the new Commission,\u201d said Brando Benifei, the head of the PD delegation in the European Parliament, adding that his appointment is \u201ca great opportunity for a fresh approach on economic, fiscal and monetary affairs.\u201d\n\nEU dilemma\n\nAs for getting the EU's help on migration, Italy has high hopes for the von der Leyen Commission.\n\n\u201cWe expect von der Leyen to fulfill her promise to put at the center of her program migration and real European policy of managing the flows,\u201d said Laura Ferrara, a 5Stars MEP.\n\nThere are signs of movement on the issue: A temporary mechanism to redistribute disembarked migrants could soon be signed at a summit in Malta between the interior ministers of Germany, France, Italy and Malta, diplomats say.\n\nYet Rome might nevertheless want to scale back its expectations on that front as well, as the Commission depends on individual member countries in this regard. Diplomats say that EU countries are keen to provide a hand to Rome on migration, but that one of the sticking points is that they don't want to relocate all migrants, only asylum-seekers.\n\nFor now, the 5Stars could be the most immediate beneficiaries of the newfound pro-EU coalition in Rome. The anti-establishment party was key in stopping Salvini, but its attempts to join the Greens and the liberal-centrist Renew Europe in the European Parliament have been so far unsuccessful due to their previous alliance with the League, leaving them isolated in Brussels.\n\nBut the League's exit from government opens new possibilities, or so 5Stars lawmakers hope. \"Many times our work in the Parliament was recognized by other political forces, but then we were penalized by this alliance with Salvini,\" said Ferrera. \"Now that we have overtaken this obstacle, we surely expect we can capitalize [on that].\"\n\nThe EU, meanwhile, faces a dilemma when it comes to Italy. On the one hand, the far right remains a threat as long as support for the new government stays low. \u201cMy fear is that without addressing the domestic concerns in Italy, we might in two years' time [again] see that pro-Kremlin republic,\u201d said an EU diplomat.\n\nBut on the other hand, the EU cannot cave to pressure from Rome on issues such as fiscal rules just because the League looms in the background, the diplomat said, warning that countries could otherwise use the threat of far-right parties rising \"to extract concessions\" from Brussels and other member states.", "description": "Nomination of former Italian premier as economy commissioner risks backfiring.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Florian Eder", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-932435532-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
