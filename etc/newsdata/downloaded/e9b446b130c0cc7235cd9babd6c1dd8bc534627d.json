What\u2019s happening in our daily lives that is contributing to this culture of just viciousness? We\u2019ve become a vicious, nasty country.\u201d\n\nMr. Acosta added that he rarely hears Americans say that it is necessary to leave a better world to the next generation.\n\n\u201cMy concern is, is that we\u2019re tearing each other apart,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is the country I love, too \u2014 my dad as I said earlier came over to this country from Cuba, came over here in 1962, three weeks before the Cuban missile crisis. [They] moved to Northern Virginia, which is where I grew up. \u2026 There was a Presbyterian church in Vienna, Virginia, that gave my dad and my grandmother coats and sweaters so they could stay warm in their first winter here in the D.C. area. They had never been cold before.\n\n\u201cAre we still that country anymore? Did John F. Kennedy call immigrants rapists and criminals back then? No.\u201d\n\nThe journalist\u2019s \u201crapist\u201d comment is in reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign launch in June 2015.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs,\u201d Mr. Trump said regarding a sub-population of illegal immigrants. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing crime, their rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we\u2019re getting. And it only makes common sense. \u2026 It\u2019s coming from more than Mexico. \u2026 We don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening and it\u2019s got to stop.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
