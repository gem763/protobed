(Picture: BBC)\n\nAnneka Rice has admitted that Strictly Come Dancing helped her to get in touch with her feminine side \u2013 despite being a self-confessed tomboy.\n\nThe 61-year-old TV presenter appeared on the current series of the dance competition with partner Kevin Clifton, and although they were the second couple to leave the show she still found the experience very rewarding.\n\nAnneka told the Radio Times: \u2018I have discovered that I have a real disconnect with dancing, which is strange as I can play the piano, as well as tennis and other sports that involve coordination and rhythm. But learning is definitely not a one-size-fits-all experience.\n\n\u2018I joined Strictly as an out-and-out tomboy and so I have been utterly overwhelmed at how feminine dancing made me feel.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve even bought three dresses this week, which has been the most surprising outcome of it all.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnneka has taken part in a number of reality shows over the years including Come Dine With Me, Celebrity Hunted, and Hell\u2019s Kitchen, but she admitted she felt completely out of her comfort zone when it comes to dancing.\n\nShe said: \u2018I feel so awkward about dancing. No one in my family has ever seen me dance and I\u2019ve never done any classes or anything like that. I don\u2019t know why, but I thought this was the year to learn.\u2019\n\nFollowing her swift exit, Anneka insisted she didn\u2019t have \u2018one negative\u2019 from her brief time on the show.\n\nShe added: \u2018I\u2019ve just loved this whole thing; I\u2019ve not one negative about the whole experience. We\u2019ve worked really hard, I\u2019m covered in bruises. I love this man, it\u2019s been a joy to have that honour, that privilege of learning to dance.\u2019\n\nAnneka with her dance partner Kevin Clifton (Picture: Guy Levy/BBC)\n\nDev Griffin and dance partner Dianne Buswell shocked both viewers and judges after their shock eviction from the BBC show last weekend.\n\nThe pair were the third couple eliminated from this year\u2019s series, despite consistently high scores.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues on Saturday at 6.40pm on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
