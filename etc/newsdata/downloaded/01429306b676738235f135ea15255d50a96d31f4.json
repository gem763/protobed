This is completely unacceptable.\n\n\"We acted swiftly to have the banner removed and we are now working with the local authorities and stadium team in Genk to identify those responsible.\n\n\"Any subsequent action will be taken in keeping with our sanctions process.\"\n\nAnother banner appeared after the original had been removed, with this one declaring \"we are not racists\".\n\nElsewhere in the away end, supporters unfurled an anti-racism banner, whilst players of both sides posed together ahead of kick-off holding \"Equal Game\" signs.", "description": "The two locations are two hours apart in distance but the fans only realised their mistake half an hour before kick-off", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Kieran Mcmanus Bpi Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20712653.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-094929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
