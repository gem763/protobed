The winners advance to the group phase where 40 countries will be divided into 10 groups.", "description": "Liberia needed a last-gasp penalty save, Ethiopia an own goal, Tanzania shoot-out penalties and Equatorial Guinea a late strike to all win their World Cup first round ties on Sunday and advance to the group phase of the qualifiers for Qatar 2022.", "authors": ["Mark Gleeson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
