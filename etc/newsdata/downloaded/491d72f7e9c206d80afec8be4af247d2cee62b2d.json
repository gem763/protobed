Salzburg, an excellent team, can only be a springboard for someone like him.\n\n\"If, then, his compatriot Solskjaer remains as coach at Manchester United , I think he can go there. Solskjaer was also the one who made him debut at Molde, as he coached the club at the time.\"\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nUnited are known to be looking at striking options following the sale of last season's top scorer Romelu Lukaku to Inter Milan over the summer, with the likes of Mario Mandzukic from Juventus or Callum Wilson from Bournemouth being suggested as possible targets.", "description": "The young Red Bull Salzburg striker has scored six goals in three games in the Champions League this season and is being linked with a whole host of elite clubs", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Reuters", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20711568.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-EUR-C1-SALZBURG-NAPOLI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
