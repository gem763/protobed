Zidane transmits a real calmness and a lot of trust and I think that's why things went so well.\n\n\"I'm speechless, I've been dreaming of this moment since I joined Real Madrid and running out at the Bernabeu with the fans chanting my name\u2026 I'm so happy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Vinicius was also delighted to get on the scoresheet, netting for Madrid for the first time since February.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The players know that I was trying hard and there's nothing better than getting back amongst the goals before a derby,\" he said via the club's website.\n\n\"It's an honour to speak with Roberto Carlos and I'm happy because he congratulated me. I'm very happy to score again at the Bernabeu.\n\n\"I'm excited because since my injury it's been difficult, I was finding it hard playing again and I wasn't doing well in games. I wasn't as happy as last season and it's a massive weight off my shoulders. I'm very happy when I'm scoring goals.\"\n\nA point clear atop the La Liga table, Real face Atletico in the Madrid derby on Saturday.", "description": "After scoring on his club debut, the Brazilian teenager was quick to stress he doesn't want to be likened to the football star", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PvNHt.8dzeB3wuTmH9YGfw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ojNSVASR0.DtcjNoEEFtfw--~B/aD0yMTYwO3c9Mzg0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/37eace2cd2faff71acfc893cd6ccef46", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
