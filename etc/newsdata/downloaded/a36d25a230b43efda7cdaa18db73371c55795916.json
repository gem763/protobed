It's all gone,' she said.\n\n'I'm just looking at footage of the fire this morning, it's a complete blackout.\n\n'The sound would have been terrifying.'\n\nMs Duncan launched a GoFundMe page on Tuesday evening, to help her father rebuild.\n\n'Last week he was with us for my son's graduation. Today my father lost everything except the clothes he was wearing in the Busby's Flat bushfire in Northern NSW. Everything has gone. Even his walking stick,' the fundraising page says.\n\nMs Duncan launched a GoFundMe page on Tuesday evening, to help her father rebuild. She shared this picture of Mr Duncan (right) at her son's graduation last week\n\n'But he is alive.\n\n'He left Canberra after experiencing the devastating 2004 bushfires ... and not wanting to go through it again.\n\n'My Dad is a proud man, but he's a classic pensioner battler. My family will do all we can, but he needs a bit of a hand. I hate asking, but I'd do anything for my Dad.'\n\nThe page raised more than $9,000 in about 13 hours.\n\n'I have no words, I'm just so grateful,' Ms Duncan said of the support.\n\n'I feel like I should be able to do this for my dad myself, but I simply cannot. I do not have the resources myself.'\n\nMs Duncan praised the NSW RFS for saving the couple's life during the blaze on Tuesday\n\nMs Duncan also extended her thanks to the RFS volunteers who risk their lives to save others.\n\n'I'm just so grateful to the Rural Fire Service volunteers,' she said.\n\n'They put their own lives at risks... leave their families to save ours.'\n\nMs Duncan said the next step is to help the little village of about 140 people find their feet again.\n\nShe added that it was also an important reminder to act on climate change.\n\n'It is Australia, climate change tells us we will get more major disasters... We will get them more often, they will be more severe,' she said.\n\nUp to 30 homes have reportedly been destroyed or damaged amid the bushfires in northern NSW.\n\n'Building Impact Assessment teams will inspect areas impacted by yesterday's bush fires across northern NSW,' NSW RFS said on Wednesday morning.\n\n'At this stage, there appears to be a significant number of homes and other buildings destroyed. We're working to get residents back when safe to do so.'", "description": "John Duncan and his wife Cassie were stuck at their Rappville home as bushfires ravaged the small village in\u00a0northern New South Wales on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/22/19462544-0-image-a-17_1570569648439.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
