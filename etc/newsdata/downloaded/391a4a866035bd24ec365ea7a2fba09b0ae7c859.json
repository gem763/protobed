It is believed they contain the remains of Polish women who had been killed at a site near Ravensbruck village, which had served as the base for a German concentration camp in 1939 to 1945.\n\nThe remains of Polish women murdered by the Nazi's at the notorious Ravensbruck concentration camp for women were discovered by researchers at the Furstenberg cemetery in northern Germany\n\nThe archaeological dig was undertaken earlier this year in an effort to identify the remains of victims killed in the Nazi-run concentration camp\n\nBishop Dembowski worked in a Catholic organisation during the early 1980s when Poland was under martial law. His mother and sister were believed to have been killed at the Ravensbruck concentration camp. Their remains are among those recently discovered at a cemetery near the cap in northern Germany.\n\nThe urns had broken down in the soil but the two metal plaques remained in a relatively good condition and containing the names of the female relatives of the post-war bishop of Wroclawek - Bronis\u0142aw Dembowski.\n\nHis sister and mother, Henryka and Ma\u0142gorzata Dembowska, were named on the two metal plaques, alongside their place and date of birth, and place and date of death.\n\nBishop Dembowski worked in a Catholic organisation during the early 1980s when Poland was under martial law.\n\nHe was known for helping those activists who pushed back against the then-government's authoritarian rule. In 1989, he also represented the Catholic Church at the Round Table negotiations between the government and the opposing parties.\n\nThe Ravensbruck camp, where his relatives have just been found, was the largest concentration camp for women.\n\nOne of the researchers involved in the dig shows a metal plaque that had been on one of the urns carrying a relative of one of Poland's well-known Catholic bishops\n\nThis plaque clearly names Ma\u0142gorzata Dembowska. It is thought she is one of those who was killed in the German concentration camp\n\nOpened in March 1939, 56 miles north of Berlin, it was exclusively for women - the majority of whom were Polish women, alongside Jewish, Russian, French and Dutch prisoners.\n\nThe female prisoners were regularly exposed to medical experiments and sterilisation as well as torture.\n\nOut of the 130,000 women at the camp close to 40,000 were from Poland. Only 8,000 survived.\n\nThe camp didn't have its own burial site for victims, so it used the cemetery in nearby F\u00fcrstenberg in north-east Germany.\n\nWomen who died at the camp were cremated and their ashes were placed in urns before being buried.\n\nIn 1989, a mass grave was discovered at the cemetery, and a panel commemorating the victims was created at a local museum.\n\nHowever, Polish media outlet The First News said many of the names were reportedly misspelled and the victims were not informed of the discovery.\n\nThis led to the polish-led archaeological dig of the site to further identify the women who may have been buried at the cemetery in Germany.\n\nThe workers uncovered the remains of at least nine women, whose ashes were found in nine urns, alongside two silver plaques identifying Bronis\u0142aw Dembowski's relatives\n\nKrzysztof Szwagrzyk, from Poland's Institute of National Remembrance, told local media next spring a ceremony will take place and the women will be buried properly.\n\n'We are planning a funeral ceremony here, as well as the unveiling of a monument to be erected by the Institute of National Remembrance,' he said.\n\n'The monument will bear the names and surnames of the victims, as well as their faces, because our aim is to restore the memory of the victims of totalitarianism, including German Nazism.'", "description": "The remains of Polish women killed in the all-female Ravensbruck concentration camp have been discovered at a nearby cemetery in northern Germany.", "authors": ["Ed Wight", "Stuart Dowell In Warsaw", "Poland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20287476-0-image-a-64_1572280272548.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
