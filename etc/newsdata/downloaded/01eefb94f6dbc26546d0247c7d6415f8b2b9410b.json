Jim Cramer was a fan of KB Home on his Mad Money program Friday night. Let's see what the charts and indicators are saying now.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of KBH, below, we can see that prices made their low back in November and have been in an uptrend since that nadir. Prices are above the rising 50-day moving average line as well as the slower-to-react 200-day line.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line is generally positive but it has yet to make a new high to confirm the price gains since the middle of August.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a bullish configuration above the zero line.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of KBH, below, we can see that while KBH may be at a 52-week high it is still below the best level of the past three years. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is slowly rising but still below its best level. The MACD oscillator is bullish on this time frame too.\n\nIn this first Point and Figure chart of KBH, below, we can see that price are above a $29 price target.\n\nIn this second Point and Figure chart of KBH, below, we used weekly close only data and here we have a price target around $35 - higher but still short of the $39 peak (see the second chart above).\n\nBottom line strategy: KBH could move higher to the $35 area for a modest gain. A strong move up to new high ground does not seem in the cards right now.", "description": "Let's see what the charts and indicators are saying now....KBH", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Kb Home Could Grind Out A Modest Gain In The Weeks Ahead", "Let'S See What The Charts", "Indicators Are Saying Now.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Bob Lang", "Timothy Collins", "Stephen Guilfoyle"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/12840140-a6f1-11e8-992b-9305d70e22ba.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
