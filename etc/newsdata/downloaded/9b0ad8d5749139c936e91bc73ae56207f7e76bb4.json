We don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously and we\u2019re a little bit tongue-in-cheek,\u201d Shufelt told the Guardian. \u201cIf you follow us on Instagram at all, you would see that, you know, we\u2019re meant to be playful and fun.\u201d\n\nFor nearly half a year, the burger \u2013 served with homemade buns and condiments \u2013 was a hit with customers.\n\nBut it was less popular with lawyers representing McDonald\u2019s.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, a firm representing the fast-food giant wrote to Shufelt, arguing that the company, which operates 36,000 restaurants worldwide, had worries the Effing Filet O\u2019 Fish was \u201clikely to cause confusion among consumers\u201d and also could \u201cdiminish and dilute the strength of McDonald\u2019s trademark\u201d.\n\nShufelt dutifully complied with the request, removing the Effing Filet O\u2019 Fish from the menu.\n\n\u201cAs a small business owner, you open your inbox and there\u2019s a letter from a lawyer telling you to cease and desist. There\u2019s a moment of panic and anxiety,\u201d said Shufelt. \u201cBut then you start reading it and you can\u2019t help but laugh.\u201d\n\nThe restaurant recently announced a new \u2013 and trademarked \u2013 burger: the McEffing Fish Filet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re changing the name and complying with what they want, but still taking a little jab at them.\u201d\n\nAfter posting images of the new burger on Instagram, the restaurant warned customers not to \u201cconfuse our McEffing fish burger with the McDonalds Fillet o Fish!\u201d\n\nShufelt is flattered the fast-food giant is \u201cworried about little old us, little old us\u201d and the 30-odd fish burgers his restaurant sells each week. \u201cAt the end of the day, I feel like I should send a gift basket to the lawyers, thanking them for all the publicity.\u201d", "description": "When the fast-food giant\u2019s lawyers swooped on a small Canadian restaurant over its fish burger, the response was pithy", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be525510a488696c177a3dc943bb57b2f2864675/0_457_7161_4297/master/7161.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=da4efec62056de9fd984b126e89c86ec", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
