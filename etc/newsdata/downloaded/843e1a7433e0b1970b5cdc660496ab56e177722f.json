Gates has been a household name for decades for two reasons: he was the face of Microsoft during an era when the company\u2019s products became ubiquitous, and, perhaps more notably, he\u2019s very, very rich. Yet, he\u2019s never been the kind of celebrity whose personal life and political opinions are splashed across the tabloids and social media. And unlike the late Steve Jobs \u2014 his contemporary and occasional rival \u2014 Gates is rarely discussed in terms of some ineffable mystique.\n\nThe title of Davis Guggenheim\u2019s three-part Netflix documentary Inside Bill\u2019s Brain: Decoding Bill Gates (which debuts on Friday, September 20th) speaks to its subject\u2019s opacity. What makes one of the world\u2019s wealthiest people tick? What formed him? How did he come to dominate a fiercely competitive industry so thoroughly that the US government sued Microsoft under antitrust statutes?\n\nGuggenheim gets into all that\u2026 sort of. Over the course of nearly three hours, Inside Bill\u2019s Brain covers the basics of Gates\u2019 life: his childhood, education, Microsoft stewardship, marriage to his wife Melinda, and the charitable foundation they co-manage.\n\nAt times, though, it seems like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is this doc\u2019s real subject. Each episode of Inside Bill\u2019s Brain focuses on one of the foundation\u2019s major initiatives: improving sewage conditions in developing countries, eradicating polio, and developing a cleaner, safer form of nuclear power. Each of the three parts shifts rapidly between interviews, biographical material, and fly-on-the-wall footage of the Gates team\u2019s philanthropic missions. Guggenheim eschews traditional transitions, and instead jumps from subject to subject, even when there\u2019s no clear connection between them.\n\nThe point, apparently, is to replicate Bill Gates\u2019 thought processes. Having spent most of his adult life (and even some of his teenage years) juggling multiple complicated projects, Gates doesn\u2019t have the kind of mind that functions in neat, straight lines. At one point, Melinda even laughs at this series\u2019s title, saying that her husband\u2019s brain is as cluttered and chaotic as the cheap apartment he once shared with Paul Allen when the two were building Microsoft.\n\nGuggenheim\u2019s approach is frequently frustrating. The director has multiple worthwhile stories to tell here, which may explain why Inside Bill\u2019s Brain is being released as a series rather than as a feature film. (Another reason: Netflix seems to favor the multipart format over a single movie.) But whenever one of those stories starts to build some narrative momentum, the doc skips to another, and then to another, and then back again. Inside Bill\u2019s Brain often feels more superficial than it actually is because it switches topics so freely.\n\nGiven what the series\u2019s title promises, viewers may also be disappointed that so much of Inside Bill\u2019s Brain is about his charity work, not about his life, personality, or beliefs. But that really shouldn\u2019t be surprising to anyone familiar with Guggenheim\u2019s other documentaries. He won an Oscar for An Inconvenient Truth, his film about former Vice President Al Gore\u2019s efforts to educate the world about climate change. He also made Waiting for \u201cSuperman\u201d about the flaws in the American public school system, and He Named Me Malala about Malala Yousafzai, the Nobel-winning Pakistani advocate for women\u2019s rights. Guggenheim has a history of using his work as a form of social advocacy.\n\nHe isn\u2019t turned off by wonky details, either. Inside Bill\u2019s Brain risks losing its audience with its first episode, which keeps the Gates biography to a minimum, and instead dedicates a lot of its run time to various designs for better public toilets that are meant to improve the water supply in poorer villages and neighborhoods. The episode demands some fascination with plumbing and a high tolerance for images of fecal matter \u2014 both in graphic video footage and in the animated illustrations Guggenheim uses throughout the series.\n\nIf Netflix subscribers only have time to watch one Inside Bill\u2019s Brain episode, they should pick the second, which comes closest to doing some \u201cdecoding.\u201d The scenes dealing with Gates\u2019 philanthropy largely take a back seat to reflections on the most significant decade of his life. In the 1970s, he and his high school classmate Paul Allen began making money with their programming skills and started talking about plans to develop software for the burgeoning personal computer market. Gates dropped out of Harvard in 1975, worried that if he waited until after he graduated to launch Microsoft, he\u2019d arrive too late.\n\nPart two of Guggenheim\u2019s documentary gets into Gates\u2019 preternatural drive to succeed, which, in the early years of Microsoft, had him memorizing license plate numbers in the company\u2019s parking lot to track who was staying late. (A veteran of those days recalls the running joke that Microsoft jobs were \u201cpart-time\u201d because employees could choose which 12 hours of the day they wanted to work.) Gates\u2019 obsessive work habits eventually drove a wedge between him and Allen, and the obvious regret he has about how that friendship ending provides some of Inside Bill\u2019s Brain\u2019s more emotional moments.\n\nThe third episode could\u2019ve used some of that emotion. The more biographical moments in part three deal with how Bill and Melinda met and married and how Gates handled accusations that he\u2019d turned Microsoft into a monopoly. The billionaire is much more guarded in this set of interviews. He comes to life more in the episode\u2019s other scenes, which have to do with potentially revolutionary ways of generating cheap energy.\n\nIn the end, Guggenheim fails to reconcile his competing agendas: to take an up-close and personal look one of this era\u2019s most important cultural figures and to tally all the ways Gates is trying to leave a lasting, positive legacy. It doesn\u2019t help that the director puts so much of himself into the doc, making his conversations with Gates seem like two amiable acquaintances shooting the breeze, rather than like a journalist pushing hard for meaningful answers.\n\nInside Bill\u2019s Brain does have some fleeting insights into who Gates is and what he\u2019s accomplished \u2014 again, mostly in episode two. But there\u2019s a moment in the series where Guggenheim and Gates talk about the latter\u2019s periodic \u201cthink weeks\u201d where he goes off the grid with a stack of books and tries to open himself up to new ideas, largely unrelated to his daily work. A more focused version of this docuseries, with the same title and intentions, might\u2019ve started here. Left alone with his thoughts, who is Bill Gates? Maybe someday, a better documentary will answer that question.", "description": "The three-part Netflix documentary Inside Bill\u2019s Brain: Decoding Bill Gates, tries to explain the Microsoft magnate.
