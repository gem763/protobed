The opportunity in Europe remains significant but execution to date has lagged expectations,\" Mr Tynan said.\n\nDomino's plans to more than double its store network in Europe from 1097 to 2850 by 2025-2030, but indicated there was scope for more than 5000 stores if Domino's had the same market penetration across Europe as it has in Australia (one store for every 35,000 customers) and Iceland (one for every 11,806).\n\n\"History shows we have nearly always upgraded [store targets] in the past,\" Mr Meij said.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, Domino's plans to increase stores from 825 to 1200 by 2025-2030 and Mr Meij believes there is scope to take sales from other fast food categories.\n\n\"The French eat three times more pizza than Australians and Germans eat three times more pizza than Australians, so Domino's sees opportunities to grow the pizza share of the market,\" he said.", "description": "Domino's Pizza says it can continue to grow by 'fortressing' its stores and working with, rather than against, online food aggregators.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8702%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_640%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/161f4b373b70aab7a58e29460729819aa92c31c1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
