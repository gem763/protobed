I would have been just happy as a I am. I don\u2019t need to be a British citizen. I don\u2019t feel I want to be a British citizen. Now I feel I should be.\u201d\n\nThey also felt less disenfranchised because the discussion of Scottish identity including EU families during the 2014 independence referendum, in which they had a right to vote.\n\n\u201cEU citizens in Scotland are worried about Brexit and what it will mean to them and the future of their children. But they also feel at home in Scotland, more than elsewhere in the UK. They feel valued for their contribution. More importantly, they feel they can belong to the Scottish nation because this is not in opposition with being also French, Italian, Polish and European,\u201d said Sigona.\n\nIn families of mixed parentage, Polish was the top nationality, followed by German and Irish.\n\nNazek Ramadan, the director of Migrant Voice and partner of the Eurochildren project, has called on policymakers across the UK to take note of the research to ensure that all migrants in the UK \u201cfeel safe and comfortable, and have a chance at a good and prosperous life\u201d.", "description": "EU citizens experienced a \u2018less hostile\u2019 atmosphere in Scotland during referendum", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6bd8ad64b7e30f71b4bbe73daafa3c23d8c648/0_0_3900_2341/master/3900.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2246c4eba14daea31e57004fefe06cc5", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
