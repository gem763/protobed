That has led to speculation that a trade war would likely cause Trump's administration to levy a tariff on autos \u2014 something he has threatened to do in the past.\n\nIf that does happen it could lead an already struggling economy to a recession, as major industries across the continent would be affected.\n\nSee More: Trump's trade attack on Europe couldn't come at a worse time for a region on the brink of recession\n\nThe EU has its hands tied until at least January, when the WTO is due to rule on whether the EU can place its own tariffs on the US.\n\n\"It's very quiet on car tariffs, that's very good news,\" an unnamed EU diplomat told the Journal on Thursday. \"The appetite of the US to take those tariff decisions has diminished.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the WTO ruled the US could impose the tariffs \u2014 which came as a result of a 15-year long dispute over aircraft subsidies. Both the EU and the US said the other was illegally subsidizing its own aircraft manufacturers, Boeing for the US, and Airbus for Europe.\n\nAfter the trade body made the decision, Trump took to Twitter, saying it was \"A nice victory!\" adding that the EU \"has for many years treated the USA very badly on Trade due to Tariffs, Trade Barriers, and more.\"\n\nThe tariffs will affect a range of goods \u2014 here's a list of what's being affected.", "description": "The EU has signaled it will aim to avoid a trade war with the US, saying that it's looking to negotiate, according to the Wall Street Journal.\u00a0 Earli...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d96ff2d707bdf06bd5c10e7-2400/trump-g7-summit-eu-canada.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
