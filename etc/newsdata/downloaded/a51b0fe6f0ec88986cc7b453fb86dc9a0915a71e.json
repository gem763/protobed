Mr Zhao, who had a more liberal attitude than other leaders, favoured a conciliatory approach towards the protesters.\n\nThat view eventually lost to those who wanted to bring in the army, and Mr Deng approved the detention of his former favourite.", "description": "The man who opposed a deadly crackdown on 1989 protests died in 2005 after years under house arrest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C7C2/production/_109283115_img_2515_02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
