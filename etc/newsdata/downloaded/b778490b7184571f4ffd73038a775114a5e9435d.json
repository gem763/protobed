Only 10 per cent said they were doing better, compared with 36 per cent in October 2018.\n\nThe contraction in residential construction activity was highlighted in the minutes of the Reserve Bank's October 1 monetary policy meeting published on Tuesday.\n\nIt noted that this contraction was expected to \"continue for some time\" with higher-density approvals falling in July to their lowest level in seven years, detached approvals also falling and non-residential construction outside the mining sector also declining.\n\nClare Cousins, immediate past president of the Australian Institute of Architects, said firms getting work from booming sectors like infrastructure and education were doing better then those focused on the big multi-residential projects, where the market has softened and consumer confidence has weakened in the wake of the cladding and defects crisis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Some of these large practices [focused on residential] can have 80 staff,\" Ms Cousins said.\n\nShe also pointed the finger at a more longer-running and now entrenched trend \u2013 the emergence of design and construction procurement contracts where architects essentially work for builders, rather than their clients \u2013 for crunching fees.\n\n\"It's fairly common for late payment to architects from the head building contractor,\" she said.\n\nRodney Paesler, managing director at architecture and design firm Scott Carver, said the market was \"always tough\" and in a \"volatile state\" as big projects came and went.\n\n\"It's a competitive industry. There are a lot of international firms in the market so it's an enormous talent pool,\" he said.\n\nMr Paesler said his firm was not hiring new staff at the moment.", "description": "The slump in residential construction activity and consumer confidence about buying off the plan has weakened pay conditions in the property industry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7957%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_54/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c5658726579eb69653b1b7c58c2664eb4fcb4c54", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
