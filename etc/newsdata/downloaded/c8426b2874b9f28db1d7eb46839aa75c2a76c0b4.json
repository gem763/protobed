This means there would have to be new customs checks on the island of Ireland \u2014 which Brussels and Dublin have always opposed.\n\nNorthern Ireland would stay aligned to EU single market rules for goods, but this would be subject to approval by the Belfast assembly every four years.\n\nIn the House of Commons on Thursday, the British prime minister said the government had shown flexibility and its plan was a \"compromise\".\n\nRead more:Why is Boris Johnson's latest Brexit plan a headache for the EU?\n\nBut there are growing signs that major gaps remain between the British proposals and the EU's red lines, as European leaders come forward to highlight concerns.\n\n\"It's very much the view of the Irish government and people of Ireland, North and South, that there shouldn't be customs checkpoints or tariffs on trade between North and South,\" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told reporters.\n\nIreland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveneytold the Irish parliament that if Johnson's proposal was the UK's final offer, there would not be a deal.\n\nHowever, he described the British plan as a \"serious proposal on the table\", adding that he hoped it would be \"a stepping stone\" towards a final agreement.\n\nOn Friday he said finding a new Brexit deal was \"not mission impossible\" and could succeed \u2014 as long as any new agreement also secured an open Irish border.\n\nAfter meeting with Varadkar on Thursday, the Swedish PM Stefan L\u00f6fven showed support for his Irish counterpart, declaring: \"We must be very firm in avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\"\n\nThe European Parliament's Brexit steering group, agreeing with Varadkar, said that \"the UK\u2019s proposals fall short and represent a significant movement away from joint commitments and objectives\". The group added that the British proposals \"do not address the real issues that need to be resolved if the backstop were to be removed, namely the all-island economy, the full respect of the Good Friday Agreement and the integrity of the Single Market\".\n\nThe parliament's Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, tweeted that the British plan was \"repackaging old, bad ideas\".\n\nUsing more diplomatic language, Donald Tusk echoed such concerns on Twitter, saying: \"Today I had two phone calls on Brexit, first with Dublin then with London. My message to Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar: We stand fully behind Ireland. My message to Prime Minister Boris Johnson: We remain open but still unconvinced.\"\n\nThe European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he joined the Irish prime minister in calling on the UK to publish the full legal text of its proposal.\n\nJuncker followed up on comments he made on Wednesday, when he said he \"welcomed\" Johnson's \"positive advances\", but noted \"still some problematic points\" particularly concerning the backstop.\n\nIn Thursday's statement, the European Commission president called for a \"legally operational solution\" that could not be based on \"untried arrangements that would be left to negotiation during the transition period. Accepting such a proposal would not meet all the objectives of the backstop\". He called for further discussions with British negotiators.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has urged both sides to continue working, to see whether a deal is possible between the UK and the EU. He stressed that an agreement would need to respect European Union principles.\n\nThe French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin said after Johnson's proposals were released that \"France does not want a tax haven at Europe's doorstep\" and called for Brexit to \"be done in an orderly manner\". But she added: \"If they want to do it differently, we have prepared ourselves.\"\n\nThe EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he had updated the European Parliament and EU governments, and reiterated that the EU wanted \"workable and effective solutions that create legal and practical certainty\".\n\nRead more:\n\n'Very little time': Johnson's letter to EU chief Juncker on latest Brexit plan\n\nBrexit Guide: Where are we now?\n\n\n\nWant more news?", "description": "Tusk says EU is 'fully behind Ireland' over Brexit and 'unconvinced' by Boris Johnson's latest border plan.", "authors": ["Alastair Jamieson"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/57/90/1000x563_cmsv2_3f84bc01-59f6-566d-9f5b-213fd5ade9a6-4205790.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
