Senior executives of what was then News International were cleared in 2014 of perverting the course of justice.\n\nNews UK, publisher of the Sun, has confirmed that a claim has been issued against it by the prince. Reach Plc, which now owns the Daily Mirror, is also aware that proceedings have been issued.\n\nHugh Tomlinson QC, chairman of Hacked Off, told the Guardian that the case illustrated the need to re-open the uncompleted Leveson inquiry.\n\n\u201cPrince Harry\u2019s case reminds us of the scale of wrongdoing by certain newspapers which went on over many years,\u201d Tomlinson said. \u201cHacked Off has long campaigned for part two of the Leveson inquiry to find out what actually happened. This reminds us of the need for that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that the action brought by the Duchess of Sussex reminds us that the press misconduct, which newspapers have said is a thing of the past, is still continuing. It emphasises the urgent need for an inquiry.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry\u2019s phone-hacking action was first reported by the Byline Investigates website, which has been monitoring what is known as the mobile telephone voicemail interception litigation (MTVIL) that is being managed by Mr Justice Mann in the chancery division of the high court.\n\nBecause there are so many claims against Newsgroup Newspapers and Mirror Group Newspapers the cases have been joined together and are being heard in regular batches. Most are settled out of court through payments; the prince\u2019s claims are not expected to come to trial, if they reach court, until next October at the earliest.\n\nMany familiar faces from the phone-hacking inquiry are likely to face questions again about their past role.\n\nIn December 2015, Alison Saunders, then the director of public prosecutions, said that after studying files submitted by police, in relation to corporate liability at News Group Newspapers and against 10 individuals at Mirror Group Newspapers for alleged phone hacking, she had decided to cease pursuing criminal investigations against Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK, and against Piers Morgan and other former editors at Mirror Group Newspapers.\n\nThe solicitor understood to be representing Prince Harry in the latest phone-hacking claims did not comment.\n\nResponding to the duchess\u2019s legal claim, the Mail on Sunday has defended its publication of a private letter to her father.\n\nThe newspaper carried a report quoting Thomas Markle, 75, the duchess\u2019s estranged father, saying he had not intended to share a private letter sent by her but felt pressured to do so after he was \u201cmischaracterised\u201d in a magazine article.\n\nThe retired lighting director said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d when it was first mentioned publicly in the American magazine. He said: \u201cI decided to release parts of the letter because of the article from Meghan\u2019s friends \u2026 I have to defend myself. I only released parts of the letter because other parts were so painful. The letter didn\u2019t seem loving to me. I found it hurtful.\u201d", "description": "Duke of Sussex joins case against Sun and Mirror in group action over phone hacking", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cf894966d3766d2baa69b69c434335c3b31f040/0_27_2409_1445/master/2409.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b326eb95ef4c362f07a3662a6074c7ca", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
