Rep. Steve Scalise, for example, was shot by a domestic terrorist who only wanted to kill Republicans, yet his stance on guns has been resolute throughout. I can\u2019t even imagine what he went through, yet he\u2019s not budged a single inch on the issue.\n\nBut even Scalise\u2019s efforts pale behind the work of Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke.\n\nThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m putting Beto up above someone like Scalise as a hero of the Second Amendment. No, I haven\u2019t lost my mind, either.\n\nYou see, Beto has managed to do something I didn\u2019t think was possible. He may well have sidelined gun control this year without holding office or even being a viable candidate for office.\n\n\u201cHell yeah,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to take away your AR-15.\u201d\n\nNot the kind of language you\u2019d expect from a hero of the Second Amendment, as I\u2019ve just proclaimed Beto. Yet with that one sentence, O\u2019Rourke has upset the gun control apple cart something fierce and done so in a way the National Rifle Association could only have dreamt of.\n\nFor years, we were told that no one was coming for our guns, that no one wanted to disarm us. Even O\u2019Rourke, while running for Senate, claimed as much. The idea was to gaslight gun owners who knew otherwise. We knew what they wanted because so many had slipped up to admit their desires, but anti-gunners were so adamant about it that some started to doubt their own sanity.\n\nThen O\u2019Rourke made his remarks on live national television and everything changed.\n\nNow, anti-gunners felt comfortable to admit that yeah, maybe they did want to take your guns. Those who took issue with his comments generally didn\u2019t do so from the idea that it was a violation of our civil liberties, only that it wasn\u2019t the right time or things like that.\n\nO\u2019Rourke exposed the ugly beast within the gun control movement. He unmasked them for who they really were.\n\nThe NRA couldn\u2019t do that.\n\nWayne LaPierre couldn\u2019t do that.\n\nTed Nugent couldn\u2019t do that.\n\nErich Pratt from Gun Owners of America couldn\u2019t do that.\n\nNo one on this side of the debate could. No one could get them to expose their own naked bias. Perhaps more importantly, no one could do so at the same time they managed to spike a potential gun control deal before it had even made it to the table. No, really.\n\nDummy Beto made it much harder to make a deal. Convinced many that Dems just want to take your guns away. Will continue forward! https://t.co/87jvaYUkyn \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\nSo yeah, in a very real way, Beto O\u2019Rourke may have just saved the Second Amendment from a Congress so willing to make a deal that they\u2019d swallow almost anything.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there won\u2019t be some kind of deal. A lot of that matters to just who blinks first to make a deal happen.\n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not saying Beto meant for any of this to happen. In fact, I\u2019m quite sure he didn\u2019t. I seriously doubt he\u2019s been harboring pro-Second Amendment sympathies all these years and chose now to unveil them to the world. If so, kudos for playing the long game like that, but I don\u2019t think anyone would buy that.\n\nNo, he did it out of incompetence.\n\nStill, he\u2019s a hero. Maybe not the hero we deserve, but the hero we needed.\n\nThanks, Beto.
