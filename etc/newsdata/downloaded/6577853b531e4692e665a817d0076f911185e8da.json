REUTERS/Mark Dadswell/Files\n\nMELBOURNE (Reuters) - Lawyers for former Vatican treasurer Cardinal George Pell on Tuesday filed an appeal to Australia\u2019s High Court in a final bid to overturn his conviction for sexually abusing two 13-year-old choir boys, the High Court said.\n\nPell is seeking leave to appeal the state of Victoria\u2019s Court of Appeal ruling which upheld his conviction on five charges of abusing the boys at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in the late 1990s when he was archbishop of Melbourne.\n\nBy a 2-1 majority, the Court of Appeal in August ruled that \u201cit was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Cardinal Pell was guilty of the offences charged\u201d, with the majority finding Pell\u2019s accuser was not a liar or a fantasist.\n\nPell\u2019s lawyers have appealed that decision on two grounds tied to whether it was possible for Pell to have committed the offences in light of all the activity that typically went on after mass in the area of the cathedral where they were said to have occurred.\n\n\u201cThe majority erred by finding that their belief in the complainant required the applicant (Pell) to establish that the offending was impossible in order to raise and leave a doubt\u201d, Pell\u2019s lawyers said in the filing to the High Court.\n\nPell\u2019s lawyers also said the majority was wrong in their conclusion that the verdicts were not unreasonable.\n\n\u201cThere did remain a reasonable doubt as to the existence of any opportunity for the offending to have occurred,\u201d the lawyers said in their filing, referring to the judges\u2019 findings.\n\nPell, the highest ranking Catholic worldwide to be convicted of child sex offences, was jailed in March for six years. He will be eligible for parole in October 2022, when he will be 81.\n\nThere is no guarantee the High Court will hear Pell\u2019s case.", "description": "Lawyers for former Vatican treasurer Cardinal George Pell on Tuesday filed an appeal to Australia's High Court in a final bid to overturn his conviction for sexually abusing two 13-year-old choir boys, the High Court said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430724160&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0DJ", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
