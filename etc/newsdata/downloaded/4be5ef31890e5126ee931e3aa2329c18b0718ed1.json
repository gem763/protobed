Woman receives harassing messages via seat-to-seat chat system on plane", "language": "en", "text": "Catcalling has reached a whole new level on a recent Virgin Atlantic flight.\n\nA woman flying from Washington DC to London thought she'd be able to work in peace on the long flight. Instead, some toxic messages bombarded her through the plane's seat-to-seat chat system.\n\nJessica Van Meir shared the harassing messages on Twitter, where it went viral with #metoo. The messages ranged from \"you tidy babe\" from a 'smack baccy tin', smiley faces from a username called 'big dick swinger' to \"currently you are in the danger zone\" from someone named 'dirty mike' after she responded to his earlier message saying \"welcome to hell\".\n\nREAD: The world\u2019s safest country for women travelling alone is not a Nordic country\n\nShe informed the flight attendants who spoke with the offenders, and she later walked up the aisle and took photos of them.\n\n\"Afterwards, a young guy came up to me and said he heard about the chat between me and the guys and wanted to apologise, on their behalf, they were on a rugby trip and he was one of the leaders.\" tweeted Van Meir.\n\n\"He said the guys had been drinking and he\u2019d talk to them, was sorry and hoped we could leave it at that. What matters to me is not going after these guys, but making sure they understand why it was harmful.\"\n\nALSO SEE: Chechen women go places with female-only taxi service\n\nVirgin Atlantic has reached out to Van Meir, saying they're sorry to hear about her experience and is busy reviewing their systems to ensure it doesn't happen again.\n\n\"Whilst we are not always responsible for the actions of our passengers, we do not deem this behaviour acceptable,\" tweeted the airline in response.\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
