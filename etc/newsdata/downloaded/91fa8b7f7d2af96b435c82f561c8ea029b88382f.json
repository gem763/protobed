The creature can be seen squirming around as it 'cleans his teeth'\n\nSea spiders are found in oceans across the globe, where they stride the seafloor with slow, deliberate steps.\n\nThey eat by stabbing stationary animals - such as sea anemones and sponges - with their long proboscises.\n\nFrom here, they suck up tissue softened by the spider's digestive juices.\n\nThe guide breathes out, sending the sea spider shooting backwards. The instructor joked that the sea spider was 'cleaning his teeth'\n\nSea spiders don't have gills, and instead take oxygen in via diffusion through their porous exoskeletons.\n\nMost species of sea spider are smaller than a fingernail.\n\nHowever, in the cold, oxygen-rich waters around Antarctica, giant species can grow to the size of dinner plates.", "description": "Peter McGuiness and wife Belinda were diving off the coast of  Bali, Indonesia.
