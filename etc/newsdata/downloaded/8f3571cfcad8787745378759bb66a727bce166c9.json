A world in which people were defined as bedsitters, flat-sharers or one-up-one-downers, instead of a combination of complex intertwining factors like race, political beliefs, age, gender or sexuality. This is a ridiculous idea that ignores the intricate reality of human existence, disregarding the never-ending process of identification to portray people as a reflection of what they own.\n\nYet an increasing number of people in the UK are being described this way.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

At the same time the number of people enduring less visible types of homelessness like living in temporary accommodation or sofa-surfing is also on the rise.\n\nThe shadow of not having a settled home is hanging over more and more people, yet we continue to lump them together as one homogenous group \u2013 \u201cthe homeless\u201d.\n\nA lot is written about how to solve homelessness in the UK. There are vital, ongoing debates focusing on the need to build more social housing, increase rent controls and reform our punitive welfare system. Yet these kind of policies can only become a reality through public support.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Why, in the sixth richest economy in the world, isn\u2019t there public outrage that more and more people are forced to experience the indignity of sleeping rough or spending sweltering summers in a shipping container?\n\nA major piece of this puzzle lies in the way we talk and write about the issue. In his book Social Identity, sociologist Richard Jenkins argues that some identities have a \u201cmaster status\u201d, a definitive power that overrides people\u2019s other less salient affiliations and characteristics. Branding someone as homeless in this way cements their economic situation as their defining characteristic.\n\nIn reality, all individuals are complex and unique. I\u2019ve met an Iranian man living in a hostel with a PhD in Chemistry, a single mother living in temporary accommodation who loves writing poetry and an 18 year old guy kicked out by his family who has dreams of becoming a journalist. Each is far more than their situation, but they\u2019re still crudely lumped together, united by what they lack.\n\nIn her book Homelessness, Citizenship and Identity, American academic Kathleen Arnold explains that economic status has become an identity in its own right. People at the bottom of the food chain are \u201ctreated politically as irrational, dependent and irresponsible.\u201d A 2017 report by the homeless charity Crisis backs this up. It found many people \u201csee homeless people as victims or outsiders who become homeless through poor choices or bad luck.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s much easier to turn a blind eye to the person attempting to live under a bridge if you think their bad decisions have put them there. At the same time the real culprits \u2013 a housing market set up in favour of those with capital and a rigged welfare system \u2013 continue to avoid prosecution.\n\nFor his 1933 classic Down and Out in Paris and London, George Orwell spent months living with so-called \u201ctramps\u201d on Britain\u2019s streets. He came to a grim conclusion: \u201cmoney has become the grand test of virtue. By this test beggars fail, and for this they are despised.\u201d Unfortunately, more than 80 years since Orwell wrote those words, money remains the grand test of virtue in our society.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It\u2019s much easier when people fall into clear, easy to understand categories. Describing people as homeless easily sums up the broad issue or a particular project or programme, but it also dehumanises them, degrading them to a mere economic category. The reality is, until we face up to the complexity of human identities and start to see the people behind the situation, huge numbers will continue to live without the security of a stable home.", "description": "Imagine a world in which your identity rested solely on the type of home you lived in.
