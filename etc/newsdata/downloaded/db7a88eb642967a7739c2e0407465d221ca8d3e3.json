She claims her husband's dementia care costs left her penniless\n\nTony Booth and his wife Stephanie at their home in Todmorden, Lancashire when he was suffering with Alzheimer's\n\nSteph gave up her job as a teacher to look after him in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. 'When Tony died we were broke. I had no income for five years and we had used all our savings,' she said.\n\n'All the benefits stop\u00ad\u00adped and I had absolutely nothing. No husband, no income, nothing. It was such a shock.\n\nTony Booth is best known for his time on the hit show Till Death Us Do Part where he played Mike Rawlins (pictured above - in character)\n\n'I lived on Universal Credit for six months. It was horrible to be that low,' she told the Mirror.\n\nShe admitted that Cherie Blair, Tony Blair's lawyer wife, had sometimes given them handouts but it was 'difficult' to ask her for help.\n\nSteph said Tony's care plan was not sufficient and she had to fork out money to be able to provide him with a good quality of life.\n\n'These packages don't take into account the needs of the human being. Instead it's a one-size-fits-all approach.'\n\nShe pointed out there were 80,000 people in the UK living with dementia. 'This disease is already causing untold misery for these people but this is added to by the bureaucracy of the system which denies people help,' she said.\n\nLast month, Steph revealed how her husband Tony was placed in a mental hospital for two weeks after 'whacking' her as he battled Alzheimer's disease.\n\nShe said the Till Death Us Do Part star, who died aged 85 in 2017, hit her in the back of the head after being told he was going into a respite home. 'He whacked me so hard I bit my tongue,' Mrs Booth, 64, told the Henley Literary Festival. 'That evening he was sectioned.'\n\nBooth \u2013 the father of former Prime Minister's wife Cherie Blair \u2013 then switched to a different drug which helped remove his 'frustration'. Mrs Booth said: 'He didn't do anything like that again.'\n\nShe met the actor in 1996 at a party and he later told her it had been 'love at first sight.'\n\nAnthony Booth was the father of Cherie Blair, wife of former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair\n\nShe admitted that Cherie Blair (pictured), former prime minister Tony Blair's wife, had sometimes given them handouts but it was 'difficult' to ask her for help\n\nShe said he saw his battle with Alzheimer's as a 'shameful secret', and refused to stop work until one day he announced he 'can't act any more'.\n\nMrs Booth said: 'That moment of recognition was incredibly painful and deeply shocking. People [with Alzheimer's] don't look ill but it just takes them apart.'\n\nThe actor had eight daughters from four marriages. Mrs Blair and others struggled to accept his diagnosis.\n\nMrs Booth's book, Married To Alzheimer's: A Life Less Ordinary With Tony Booth, tells in detail how he attacked her. She wrote the force of the blow 'hurt my eyes' and made her 'bite my tongue hard'.\n\nShe added: 'There was blood pouring out of my mouth, but more than anything I was completely shocked.\n\n'Tony had locked himself in the bathroom and was insisting he hadn't hit me. I had to rummage about...for a T-shirt to mop up the blood. Things had really gone too far. I could not and did not want to cope with Tony's behaviour any more.\n\n'I phoned the GP who suggested that, for my own safety, Tony would have to be sectioned. I was upset, but knew there was no other option.'", "description": "Cherie Blair's stepmother Steph Booth, 64, admitted she claimed Universal Credit after her late husband's dementia care costs wiped out her savings and she was left penniless after his death.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/01/19908008-0-image-a-39_1571443692394.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
