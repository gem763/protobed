Eh, probably not, but at least I did go 5-2 last week with a bit assist from the Steelers \u2026 and from the refs in Green Bay, or so I hear. That puts my season total at a more respectable 25-17 and gives me a bit of a winning streak here. Just like the Steelers! (I hope.)\n\nJazz: I\u2019ll confess that after my previous substandard 3-4 performance I was worried I might repeat it again. The good news is that I didn\u2019t. The bad news is that I managed to go 1-6, taking me to an anemic 19-23 on the season. I can barely see Ed\u2019s taillights in the distance ahead of me. If it weren\u2019t for the Packers I would have set a Hot Air game record shutout. Just my luck that I picked against my own team when they finally managed to beat the odds and win their first game. I\u2019ll need to find a way out of the wilderness this week or the whole regular season may be slipping away.\n\nEd: Speaking of the Steelers, their one-game winning streak is safe \u2014 they have a bye, and Mason Rudolph has another week to step back into the starting role for the sad-sack Dolphins on the 28th. Devlin \u201cDuck\u201d Hodges will step back to the bench but with a lot more confidence after last week\u2019s performance. The Vikings go on the road to take on the angry Lions (1 pm ET, Fox), who are still complaining about the referees in last Monday\u2019s loss. They should be more worried about their 28th-ranked D and especially their 26th-ranked rushing defense. Minnesota has not looked great on the road, but this is an indoor game and Dalvin Cook should open up the play-action pass all day long. Minnesota 30-20 over Detroit. The Jets host the unbeaten Pats on Monday night (8:15 pm Monday, ESPN) after having stunned the Cowboys \u2014 and pretty much everyone else. Sam Darnold makes a big difference, but not big enough against the undefeated Patriots. As much as I\u2019d like to see the Patriots take a licking, Tom Brady will keep on ticking with New England 33-17 over NYJ.\n\nJazz: Okay. Once more into the breach and here we go. Thankfully I don\u2019t have to pick against the Steelers again. The Lions have shown the ability to surprise the experts when the chips are down, but they\u2019ve really been running up some bad numbers. Even with home-field advantage, I\u2019ve got to go with the Vikings over the Lions 25-20. That leaves us with my Jets. Yes, it was an impressive win over the Cowboys last week, but that was an uneven opponent who dipped in the wrong direction just when the returning Sam Darnold put together some magic. The Pats are too strong, even in an away game. I\u2019ll sadly pick New England over my Jets 34-17.\n\nLet\u2019s pick five more to get us to seven again for this week:\n\nEd:\n\nRaiders at Packers (1 pm, CBS) \u2013 These are two teams still struggling to set an identity for themselves this season. Green Bay has a decent defense, while Oakland gives up a few less yards but five more points a game. The Pack scores three more points a game too, plus they\u2019re at home and need to protect their division lead. Should be a good game, but let\u2019s hope that\u2019s especially true for the refs. Packers 27-20 over the Raiders .\n\nThese are two teams still struggling to set an identity for themselves this season.

Texans at Colts (1 pm, CBS) \u2013 The two defenses are almost even in terms of performance this season, but Houston\u2019s offense is ranked 6th in the league. Indy\u2019s O ranks in the bottom third. The Texans are more vulnerable against the pass, but the Colts rank 26th in passing offense. The Colts are a slight favorite, but I\u2019ll take Houston 23-21 over Indy .\n\nThe two defenses are almost even in terms of performance this season, but Houston\u2019s offense is ranked 6th in the league.

Saints at Bears (4:25 pm, Fox) \u2013 Teddy Bridgewater has done a fine job leading the Saints in Drew Brees\u2019 absence, but he\u2019s losing two of his top three targets today \u2014 Alvin Kamara and Jared Cook, both out with injuries. That puts a backup on the road against the league\u2019s third-stingiest defense on points, giving up only 13.8 per game. Da Bears are more middling against the pass, but with Kamara and Cook out, Chicago might have an easier time against Bridgewater\u2019s arm. The Bears\u2019 O hasn\u2019t been all that impressive, but they\u2019re playing at home, too. Chicago 21-17 over New Orleans .\n\nTeddy Bridgewater has done a fine job leading the Saints in Drew Brees\u2019 absence, but he\u2019s losing two of his top three targets today \u2014 Alvin Kamara and Jared Cook, both out with injuries.

Ravens at Seahawks (4:25 pm, Fox) \u2013 Both teams\u2019 defenses have seen better days, but both offenses more than make up for that. The Ravens rack up more yards per game than anyone else, and they only fall a point short of the Pats for best in points scored at 30.7 per game. Seattle scores three fewer points per game and give up a point more per game than Baltimore, but they\u2019re also playing at home \u2014 and they have played more consistently this season. Seattle 35-31 over Baltimore .\n\nBoth teams\u2019 defenses have seen better days, but both offenses more than make up for that.

Eagles at Cowboys (8:20 pm, NBC) \u2013 Both of these division rivals have played disappointing football this season, and they have identical 3-3 records. The Cowboys are getting healthy, though, especially on offense, while Philly has six players ruled out of this game. Dallas racks up a lot more yards on offense than Philly does, but the Eagles score 1.3 more points per game. The real differences here will be the Cowboys\u2019 stingy defense and home-field advantage. Dallas 24-19 over Philadelphia.\n\nJazz:", "description": "Ed: Did we see the beginning of Duck's dynasty in Pittsburgh?
