Delegates queued for at least an hour last year to see their darling.\n\nNow prime minister and party boss, Johnson arrived in Manchester for the event, which runs until Wednesday, amid a flurry of further accusations about his conduct \u2014 both personal and political \u2014 with a party willing him to change their fortunes.\n\nWhile opponents decry his aggressive approach to Brexit \u2014 which has seen him lose every vote he has faced in the House of Commons since becoming leader, fail in his bid to stop MPs passing a law that seeks to block a no-deal Brexit, and see his five-week suspension of parliament ruled unlawful by the U.K.'s top court \u2014 the prime minister shows no sign of backing down from a strategy that his team say is working.\n\n\u201cWe have more members than ever before and more young people than ever before coming along, so it\u2019s going to be a really positive, upbeat conference,\u201d said Pamela Hall, the president of the Conservative grassroots board who chairs the conference. \u201cI\u2019ve never known us as united as we are at the moment. Everybody is fully behind the prime minister.\u201d\n\nAndrew Colborne-Baber, who chairs the party board on memberships, announced Sunday morning that the party has 189,000 members, up from around 130,000 in early 2018. He attributed the boost in part to a new database which was more effective at preventing memberships from lapsing and also to Johnson. \u201cThere are a lot of people coming on board since the leadership election,\u201d he said.\n\nPolls, too, look largely positive for the prime minister, with an Opinium survey for the Observer reporting the Tories holding a 12-point lead over Labour.\n\nJohnson was greeted with a hero\u2019s welcome on Sunday morning when he gave a surprise address to the National Conservative Convention of local party chairs and other senior campaigners. He received a standing ovation before he had uttered a word, telling the party faithful there would be a general election \u201cas soon as the chickens waddle out of the coop\u201d \u2014 a reference to opposition parties who have, thus far, refused to back a vote.\n\n\u201cThe mood was absolutely buoyant,\u201d said one association chair. \u201cHe is our glorious leader!\u201d\n\nAsked whether he has a plan for the U.K. leaving on October 31 \u2014 even if he could not secure a deal with Brussels by then, and despite the new law which would force him to seek an extension to negotiations without one \u2014 Johnson implied that he does but declined to share it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see him break the law,\u201d said the association chair. \u201cBut because of the MPs, he can\u2019t move, he\u2019s totally snookered in. But I still think he\u2019ll find a loophole.\u201d\n\nTo the ballot box\n\nMembers also appeared confident about Tory prospects at an election, even if Johnson does end up having to break his key promise to take the U.K. out of the European Union by October 31 \"do or die.\"\n\nSome MPs fear that in such a scenario, the Conservative vote would be vulnerable to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party. But if Johnson is seen by Leave voters to have strained every sinew to pull the U.K. out of the EU by the end of October, the Brexit Party could still be thwarted. \u201cIf Boris looks like he\u2019s done everything he can, we\u2019ll be OK,\u201d said one senior Brexiteer MP.\n\nThe party even mocked up its own newspaper front page-come-donation plea, to hand out around the conference, with the main story, headlined \u201cBrexit to finally be delivered,\u201d about Johnson winning a fresh mandate from the country. A second fantasy story described Labour going \u201cback to the drawing board\u201d with the resignation of Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n\u201cPeople are feeling very bullish,\u201d said another senior grassroots Tory when asked about an election.\n\nHowever, some harbor concerns Johnson could sell out some Tory seats by agreeing a non-aggression electoral pact with the Brexit Party. Farage took out his own double-page advert in the Sunday Telegraph \u2014 the newspaper of the Conservative heartlands which used to employ Johnson as a star columnist \u2014 reiterating his offer if Johnson delivers a no-deal Brexit.\n\nMembers wanted to know whether the Tories would rule out a pact with Farage during the NCC meeting, according to a senior Tory in the room, and there was relief when party chairman James Cleverly ruled it out.\n\nIn a bid to keep the membership onside, new initiatives at the conference including policy debates and question sessions with Cabinet ministers have been added to the agenda in the hope of giving the rank and file more buy-in to an event which for years has been little more than a beauty parade of senior figures making dull speeches.\n\nModerates bite their tongue\n\nEven among Tory moderates, criticism is muted, despite Johnson kicking 21 of their faction out of the party in pursuit of his aggressive Brexit strategy.\n\nAt a reception for One Nation Conservatives, a caucus of around 100 MPs on the left of the party, Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan, who chaired the group until she joined Johnson's Cabinet, urged them to stay in the party.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister absolutely is a One Nation conservative. He is a social liberal,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added the party should be \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with Johnson's recent domestic policy announcements, including liberalizing rules for international students and investing in public services, and said she was \u201cfully subscribed\u201d to the conference slogan: Get Brexit Done.\n\n\u201cIf we can get Brexit done, we can then talk about the issues that the rest of the country want us to talk about,\u201d she said.\n\nThe only note of caution at the event came when David Gauke, one of the anti-no-deal MPs who was booted out of the party, warned the Conservatives would \u201chave to make a choice as to what sort of party we are\u201d in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t sound like the party of Churchill or even Margaret Thatcher who, robust and radical as she was, believed passionately in our institutions, and would never undermine the importance of our parliament or our legal system,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t sound like the party of Major or Cameron or May, instead ... we sound like the party of Trump \u2014 populist, confrontational and divisive.\u201d\n\nSome in the room said \u201chear, hear.\u201d\n\nBig problems loom\n\nNevertheless, big risks loom in the shadows.\n\nJohnson is facing questions about two alleged scandals. Several official investigations, including one by police, have been launched into whether he improperly funneled public funds to Jennifer Arcuri, a businesswoman and former model he was close to during his time as mayor of London. \u201cEverything was done in accordance with the code and everything was done with full propriety,\u201d the prime minister told the BBC's Andrew Marr Sunday.\n\nJournalist Charlotte Edwardes on Sunday accused Johnson of inappropriately touching her leg at a lunch when he was editor of the Spectator back in 1999. \u201cUnder the table I feel Johnson\u2019s hand on my thigh,\u201d she wrote in the Sunday Times. \u201cHe gives it a squeeze. His hand is high up my leg and he has enough inner flesh beneath his fingers to make me sit suddenly upright.\u201d\n\nAfter a day of fielding questions about the claim, a Downing Street spokesman told journalists on Sunday evening: \u201cThese allegations are untrue.\u201d Edwardes tweeted that she stands by her story.\n\nThe bitterness over Brexit, which has intensified since the Supreme Court overturned the suspension of parliament, has eroded trust between the parties. The usual conference-season truce is forgotten, and opposition leaders will meet on Monday to mull ways of frustrating the Tory gathering.\n\nAny surprise House of Commons votes could see Tory MPs flocking back to Westminster \u2014 throwing carefully planned speaking slots and fringe events into chaos. Liz Saville Roberts, the Westminster leader of Plaid Cymru, has revealed she and cross-party colleagues are looking into whether the prime minister could be impeached. The Scottish National Party, meanwhile, wants to call a vote of no confidence in the prime minister as soon as possible.\n\nFor all the optimism, Johnson has plenty of problems.", "description": "Despite widespread criticism about his personal and political conduct, the British prime minister is greeted as a hero by his party faithful at their annual gathering.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Annabelle Dickson", "Charlie Cooper", "Tracy Brabin", "James Randerson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1177895653-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
