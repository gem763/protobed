GBP and AUD are the strongest majors, CAD and JPY are the weakest.\n\nA weaker Yuan has seen USD/CNH move to a 1-month low, which keeps USD/SGD on our bearish watchlist.\n\nElsewhere, the USD was slightly firmer with USD/JPY edging its way to fresh highs, and USD/CAD consider a new weekly high. EUR/USD remains near the top f yesterday\u2019s elongated bullish range, eyeing up a break of 1.1100.\n\nIn a Reuters poll, 33 of 41 economists further easing from BOJ, yet only 13 of them expect it to be next week.

The on-going \u201crisk-on optimism\u201d has been triggered by European central bank, ECB that reopened the \u201cQE floodgate\u201d as long as it deems fit and another bout of \u201ctrade deal optimism\u201d headline where media has reported that U.S. President Trump advisers are considering an interim deal with China that will delay and even roll back some U.S. tariffs.\n\nconsecutive week as the markets are wrapping up for the weekend.

The best outperformer so far as at today\u2019s Asian mid-session is the Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 (the 3 rd consecutive day) as it rallied by 1.04%.

For the week, the Nikkei has advanced almost 3.5%, on track to post its biggest gain in eight months. Korea\u2019s Kospi 200 remains shut for a public holiday today. The leading sector in the Nikkei 225 is the interest rate sensitive real estate sector that has gained by 2.0% ahead of Fed and BOJ monetary policy meetings next week.\n\nOver in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index has posted a modest gain of 0.34% with major property developer stocks underperforming; Sino Land, New World Development, Sun Hung Kai Properties and CK Asset Holding have declined by -1.80%, -0.77% and -0.35% respectively.

The Index is now poised to retest its current all-time level of 3028 printed earlier in 26 Jul 2019.\n\nUp Next:\n\nUS retail sales held up well in July, although expected to soften in August. We doubt it will have little impact regarding the Fed cutting next week, but it could allows for a little USD upside should the data remain firmer than expected, later today.\n\nThe University of Michigan Sentiment Index fell to its lowest read since October 2016 in August. In percentage terms, it was the largest monthly drop in consumer sentiment since December 2012. So we\u2019ll keep a close eye on how it fares later today, because if consumer confidence continues to falter, it could further raise expectations for Fed easing this year ad into next. So, a weak print today could be supportive of US indices (which sit just off of their record highs).\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
