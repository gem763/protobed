And yet almost every single Democratic candidate has an LGBTQ justice issue in their platform,\" she said.\n\n\"That's a big win.\"\n\nLike Johnson, a number of voters within the LGBTQ community have found themselves worried under President Donald Trump's tenure, advocates and voters told USA TODAY.

His family worries the DA is 'anti-gay'\n\nVoters who identify as LGBT made up 6% of the electorate in the 2018 midterms, according to NBC News exit polling. While it's a relatively small percentage, the bloc of voters has overwhelming supported Democrats: In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton won voters who identified as LGBT 77 percent to 14 percent over Republican Donald Trump.\n\nOn Thursday evening, nine Democratic candidates will make their pitch to voters in an LGBTQ-focused town hall televised on CNN in partnership with the Human Rights Campaign. The town hall comes the day before National Coming Out Day, an annual event celebrating LGBTQ awareness.\n\n\"We are living in a really, really dark moment where a lot of terrible harm and deep pain is being inflicted on so many of our community that we love and care about,\" said Sharon Mcgowan, chief strategy officer and legal director of Lambda Legal, an organization founded to help achieve full civil rights for members of the LGBTQ community. \"We each need to step up as much as we can to acknowledge that we have a role to play.\"\n\nLegislation a top priority\n\nSarah Massey, director of communications for the National LGBTQ Task Force, said she has seen people in the community become more engaged after the Trump presidency.\n\n\u201cTrump is a reaction to our great progress,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we see ourselves showing up, protesting, marching, the LGBTQ dance parties in front of Trump Tower, we\u2019re inspired.\u201d\n\nA few months after Trump's inauguration, LGBTQ demonstrators took to the streets of Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and several other cities across the nation to protest the new president. At the time, it was one of the largest protests since Trump took office, according to the BBC.\n\nMore: Supreme Court is divided over gay, transgender job bias in civil rights case to be decided during 2020 election\n\nWith the increase in interest comes a focus on tangible changes voters can connect to.\n\nPassage of the Equality Act, which would provide non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people, is among the top priorities for members of the LGBTQ community, Massie said. The House of Representatives has passed the legislation, but the bill has not been brought up in the Senate. A Trump administration spokesperson told CNN the president supports equality for all, but doesn't support the Equality Act due to the inclusion of \"poison pills that threaten to undermine parental and conscience rights.\"\n\n\u201cFrom launching a global effort to end the criminalization of homosexuality to pledging to end the HIV epidemic by 2030, President Trump will continue to protect and empower all members of the LGBTQ community across this country,\u201d said Sarah Matthews, deputy press secretary for Trump's reelection campaign.\n\nGillian Branstetter, media relations manager with the National Center for Transgender Equality Action Fund, said the first thing a new, Democratic administration should do is rollback Trump\u2019s policies affecting the LGBTQ community, in particular those impacting transgender people.", "description": "LGBTQ voters' voices will be key\u00a0as\u00a0Democrats look to energize their base and take back the White House next November.", "authors": ["Rebecca Morin", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KdTmq11cDHc2dQUZoApQzA--~B/aD0yODMxO3c9NDI1MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/f623462619cacf2c2ecdf484416870bf", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
