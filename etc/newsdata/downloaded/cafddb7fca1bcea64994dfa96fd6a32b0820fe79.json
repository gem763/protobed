K, +2.78% shares rose 3.2% in Tuesday premarket trading after the food company reported third-quarter earnings and sales that beat expectations. Net income totaled $247 million, or 72 cents per share, down from $380 million, or $1.09 per share, last year. Adjusted EPS was $1.03, ahead of the 91-cent FactSet consensus. Sales of $3.37 billion were down from $3.47 billion last year, but ahead of the $3.35 billion FactSet outlook. The earnings decline was due to pension withdrawal liabilities. And the declines in adjusted EPS and sales were owing to the divestiture of the cookie, fruit snack, pie crust and ice cream cone businesses. \"Our reshaped portfolio is doing what it is intended to do, focusing on our higher growth categories and markets,\" said Chief Executive Steve Cahillane in a statement. \"And, as we move past our heaviest investments and costs, we are on track for delivering gradual improvement in profitability.\" Kellogg's brands include Pringles, Cheez-It and Pop-Tarts.
