But the day after his first PrEP+ party in New York City, Frank Ocean felt compelled to issue a whole statement. The event, billed as a recurring queer club night that pays \u201chomage to what could have been of the 1980s\u2019 NYC club scene if the drug [PrEP+] \u2026 had been invented in that era,\u201d received criticism for erasing queer history, not being queer-inclusive, and just being hard to get into. But it\u2019s all okay, Frank says! \u201cClub culture around late 70s and 80s nightlife in NYC was a special, much talked about and written about thing,\u201d he writes on Tumblr (where he may be the only one still with an account). \u201cI recognize NY wasn\u2019t all lasers and disco lighting and that simultaneously, there was a lot of crime and poverty and that a huge part of club culture, the gay community, at that time were being wiped out by HIV + AIDS.\u201d As for his decision to name the night after an HIV-prevention drug, Ocean writes, \u201cThe pricing strategy behind it is malicious in my opinion and so it\u2019s public perception is marred and rightfully so. But the fact remains that despite price being a very real barrier to this potentially life saving drug for some, the other very real barrier is awareness.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, Ocean is \u201chappy that folks are talking about the subject in the first place.\u201d And if you\u2019re a hater, you\u2019re now invited: \u201cI saw someone say that this was a PR stunt etc etc, pshhh bitch pls come get a drink next time and I\u2019ll put several barstools out so you can have as many seats as you need.\u201d See you next week, then?", "description": "After announcing and hosting his first PrEP+ club night in New York, influenced by the queer club scene of the \u201980s and attempting to imagine a world without AIDS, Frank Ocean is explaining himself.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/18/18-frank-ocean.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
