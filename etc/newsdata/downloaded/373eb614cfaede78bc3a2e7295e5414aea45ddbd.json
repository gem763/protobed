He also has a thing for cameo jewellery.\n\nHis collection has its own room in his Paris home, while some pieces are on loan to the Museum of Jewellery in Vicenza, Italy. He wears his jewellery regularly, often sporting elegant necklaces or chokers. \u201cI don\u2019t just wear jewels for a dinner party. I wear them even on the M\u00e9tro,\u201d Felloni told The New York Times after being appointed creative director of Roger Vivier in March 2018.\n\nFelloni\u2019s favourite piece is a necklace that features two diamond pins created by the famous French jeweller and collector Henri Vever in the late 19th century.\n\nBut his most sentimental item of jewellery is the very first necklace he bought. Purchased from the Milan jewellery store Gioielleria Pennisi, \u201cit is very important to me because it influenced all the jewellery choices I have made since\u201d, he says.\n\nRoger Vivier is Felloni\u2019s \u201cdream job\u201d. The glamorous Parisian accessories label has shod the likes of Elizabeth Taylor and the infamous Duchess of Windsor, while Catherine Deneuve famously wore the Vivier Belle de Jour shoe in the 1967 film of the same name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think every shoe designer looks at the history of fashion to get inspiration. And for me Roger Vivier has always been like a mentor. He\u2019s always been someone who made the most beautiful things ... when I was at the beginning of my career, I used to say, one day I would love to work at Roger Vivier.\u201d\n\nJen Rubio\n\nCo-founder and chief brand officer of Away\n\nJen Rubio with her celebratory eternity ring from Carbon & Hyde. Daniela Spector\n\nIt\u2019s been a big year for the American luggage start-up Away, founded by Jen Rubio and Steph Korey in 2015, valued at $US1.4 billion ($2.4 billion) in May and now shipped to 40 countries including Australia.\n\nRubio\u2019s favourite piece of jewellery, a Rainbow eternity ring set with 18 coloured sapphires from Los Angeles jewellers Carbon & Hyde, celebrates that success.\n\n\u201cI bought it a few years ago,\u201d she says. \u201cThings with Away had started to pick up, I was in a new relationship, I\u2019d just moved into a new place and I remember being drawn to this ring because it was so happy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significant piece of jewellery, but also so light and fun, and it just reminds me of that time.\u201d\n\nFor Rubio, jewellery is about emotions. \u201cYou just have to love it,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cMany of my pieces have a story or were a gift from someone important, and many others are just beautifully designed and remind me of a specific time in my life. If you don\u2019t look at your jewellery and feel something, then it feels like a waste to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustin O\u2019Shea\n\nFounder of menswear label SSS World Corp\n\nJustin O'Shea at Paris Fashion Week in January, wearing his favourite piece, a pinky ring, on his right hand. Getty\n\nAt his spring 2020 show in Paris in June, Australian designer Justin O\u2019Shea sent his models down the runway wearing giant pearl necklaces.\n\nThe tattooed street-style star, who grew up in Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory, has a passion for pearls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story but I made a trip to Tahiti to buy pearls when I was about 28. I had a random dream to be a pearl trader. Anyway, it led me to meet the Paspaley family [of Paspaley pearls], which is the most incredible company.\n\n\u201cThe thought of something so precious that grows naturally in the ocean, impossible to predict, is a beautiful one.\n\n\u201cI always wear a gold mother-of-pearl earring which we designed together,\u201d he says, and he bought his grandmother a Paspaley bracelet for her 90th birthday.\n\nO\u2019Shea\u2019s most treasured piece is a pinky ring made eight years ago by his good friend the Sikh American designer Waris Ahluwalia of House of Waris. Fine Jewellery.\n\n\u201cIt was my most elaborate birthday present to myself,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a large emerald-cut ruby from Rajasthan, set in a 24-carat gold \u2018brutalist\u2019 setting, beautifully engraved with my initials on one side and a palm tree on the other and surrounded with a decorative pattern similar to what you would see on old Winchester rifles.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHiromi Yu\n\nManaging director of Marais\n\nHiromi Yu says she never leaves the house without hoop earrings. Supplied\n\nJewellery completes an outfit, says Hiromi Yu, founder of the luxury Melbourne boutique Marais, which stocks high-end labels including Alexander McQueen, Loewe, Balenciaga and Celine.\n\nWhile Yu wears both fine and costume jewellery during the day to \u201cenhance\u201d her outfits and never leaves the house without hoop earrings, her favourite piece actually belongs to her father. It\u2019s a \u201crather genderless\u201d rose gold ring set with a pink-orange padparadscha sapphire from Sri Lanka.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got exquisite taste in jewellery,\u201d she says.\n\nAt the moment Yu is mad for Grecian chokers, because \u201cthey complete a look quite irresistibly\u201d. Her favourite era for jewellery was \u201cthe golden age\u201d of ancient Greece. Why? \u201cPlenty of hoop earrings.\u201d", "description": "Whether a gift from a loved one or a gift to oneself, the true value of a prized piece goes way beyond the price tag.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3396%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_685%2C$y_40/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cda738d618fa3c3e73e702ac5abe37f4b430a2f0", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
