You feel privileged to play in front of such an amazing atmosphere. That's what you dream of as a young one.\n\n\"Hopefully we can get that back this year and other clubs follow suit as well.\"\n\nAt Melbourne Victory, there has also been a push to reconnect with its supporter groups.\n\nClub chairman Anthony Di Pietro said Victory expected to see their active supporters march to Marvel Stadium ahead of Saturday's Melbourne derby.\n\n\"Every effort is underway to enable active supporters to freely express themselves in a way that this game does so well,\" Di Pietro said at Victory In Business Season Launch on Wednesday.\n\n\"We understand that our active supporters are going to march to the stadium on Saturday, Western Sydney Wanderers are in a new world class boutique stadium this season, and their active supporters are back.\n\n\"We need every football follower in on the game this season and we can't wait for it.\"\n\nMelbourne Victory have previously enjoyed one of the league's loudest and most prolific terraces.\n\nThe \"North Terrace\" active supporter group ceased its active support after two rounds of the 2016/17 season, citing an \"untenable\" situation.\n\nOn Monday night, the group's Facebook page posted for the first time since December 2016, with a simple message: \"stay tuned\", hinting at a potential return.", "description": "On the eve of the A-League season, clubs and players are keen to look back to the future with a push to re-engage with active support.In previous years,...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
