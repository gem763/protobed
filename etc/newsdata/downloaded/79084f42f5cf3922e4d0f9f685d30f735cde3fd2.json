The utility also blamed outages on delays in the return to service of units that were on planned maintenance, and said it is struggling with limited diesel supply.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Eskom said a conveyor belt supplying Medupi power station in Limpopo with coal failed on Saturday. This cut the station's power output by half.\n\nSince Saturday, the utility has used pumped storage and open cycle gas turbines \"extensively\" to make up for the electricity shortfall. But now dam and diesel levels are running low.\n\nStage 2 load shedding has been implemented from 9:00 to 23:00.\n\nStage 2 load shedding allows for 2 000MW of power to be shed on a rotational basis. Stage 1 is the \"lightest\" load shedding schedule, while during Stage 4, up to 4000 MW of power can be shed.\n\nLast month Eskom warned that plant maintenance, which often takes place during the summer, may trigger outages.\n\n\"Most of our power stations are in need of maintenance to improve reliability... we do our best to strike the right balance between plant maintenance and keeping the lights on,\" said Eskom chairperson and acting CEO Jabu Mabuza.\n\nTo avoid load shedding, unplanned breakdowns needed to be contained at below 9 500MW during this maintenance period. In the event that generator breakdowns are experienced beyond 10 500MW, there will be high usage of emergency resources (diesel and pumped storage generators) which may lead to load shedding, Eskom previously said.\n\nUnplanned breakdowns have now exceeded this limit, the power utility said on Wednesday. It also \"unreservedly\" apologised to South Africans.\n\nSouth Africa last experienced load shedding in March this year, in part because a cyclone in Mozambique affected power imports from the country. Eskom also didn't have enough diesel at the time.\n\n#PowerAlert Due to a shortage of capacity stage 2 loadshedding is to be implemented from 9 am to 11pm today.

While it avoided falling into a recession in the second quarter, the economy has been struggling.\n\nThe rand, meanwhile, weakened by almost a percent to R14.99/$ on Wednesday morning.\n\nCompiled by Helena Wasserman", "description": "In addition, five electricity generating units are unavailable due to boiler tube leaks", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3963/1ce36236034a452d9d53f081247382dc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
