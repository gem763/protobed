He kicked off his Friday with a fresh barrage of tweets decrying the whistleblower\u2019s complaint as \u201cso inaccurate\u201d and patting himself of the back for a \u201cvery legal and very good\u201d call with the Ukrainian president.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said earlier this week that the whistleblower wants to speak with his committee and talks are underway to set a date.", "description": "Executive editor Dean Baquet is defending the decision amid criticism from readers and the whistleblower's lawyers.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8e0e3121000034005fc3a3.jpeg?cache=ghok0kpm4f&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
