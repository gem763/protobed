Bernie Sanders (I-VT) during the 2016 primary and then voted for libertarian Gary Johnson in the general. He added he does not want to take the network down, just to have their biases known.\n\n\"But for someone to purport that they are straight up, down the middle, facts first, the most trusted name in news like the CNN of old, I saw many things everyday to the contrary and I spent the first basically two years of my employment there basically fighting what I originally thought,\" Poarch explained. \"I mean, I came there as a staunch person on the left for in today\u2019s terms, probably the far-left...I mean, I came here obviously as a registered Democrat, Bernie voter, I obviously was a never Trumper at the time.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m actually coming way back to the conservative side and a lot of [friends] asked me how I could even thinking about being a conservative or conservative leaning and I tell them \u2014 I told them precisely working at CNN is what caused me to shift back to the center, center-right,\" he said.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/15/2019 19:02:31PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/288/86ebecec-752f-411f-8f54-6aba4f58fadb.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
