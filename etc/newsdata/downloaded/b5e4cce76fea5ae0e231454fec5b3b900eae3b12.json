I think he did it in a characteristically classy way. In lots of ways he\u2019s set an example for the rest of us.\n\n\u201cWe all need to pick ourselves up and dust ourselves off after the election.\n\n\u201cI think what Bill\u2019s done, to be a champion for Australians with a disability and people who are being hounded by the government\u2019s robo-debt program, has been terrific. I pay tribute to Bill for doing that.\n\n\u201cHis views on the policies we took to the election obviously carry a lot of weight. He made a series of points, including that it\u2019s possible that we took too many issues to the election and that made it hard to build the case for them.\n\n\u201cWe may have spread ourselves too thin. We do need to listen to the message that was sent us on election night. We should have won the election and we didn\u2019t. We\u2019ve got things to learn from that.\"\n\nDr Chalmers said Labor wouldn't take an identical set of policies to the next election.", "description": "The former Labor leader says he plans stay another 20 years in federal politics, after taking the blame for Labor's loss in May.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_11/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3939318324bd38e456a6d543e7b8a6b3a9f2db73", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
