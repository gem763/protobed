Matt Gaetz.\n\nJack Posobiec, who was an early pusher of the fake Pizzagate conspiracy theory, and far-right activist Laura Loomer, were also speakers.\n\nThe conference was held at Trump National Doral Miami Golf Resort.\n\nGiven the venue and the appearance of the president\u2019s son, the event is emblematic of how far-right groups and figures with conspiratorial leanings have increasingly infiltrated mainstream conservatism since Donald Trump became president.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nThe conference held this weekend by a pro-Trump group \u2013 which included the screening of a video depicting a fake President Donald Trump shooting various news media outlets and political opponents \u2013 is emblematic of the rising influence of far-right and conspiracy theory-pushing groups in the Trump era.\n\nThe video was shown at the second annual conference for the ultra-conservative American Priority group, and featured some prominent right-wing figures as speakers, including Donald Trump Jr. The conference was held in Florida at Trump National Doral Miami Golf Resort.\n\nBoth the White House and the organiser of the event have sought to distance themselves from the violent video, which was first reported by The New York Times.\n\nBut given the venue and the appearance of the president\u2019s son, as well as former administration officials such as Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the event is emblematic of how far right groups have increasingly infiltrated mainstream conservatism since Trump became president.\n\nSome of the other speakers included Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, who previously served as the chairman of the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump\u2019s latest conspiracy theory is that the Kurds released ISIS prisoners to pull the US back into Syria\n\n\n\nThey were joined by such figures as Dinesh D\u2019Souza, the documentarian who received a presidential pardon from Trump for a felony conviction last year, as well as people like Jack Posobiec.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign season, Posobiec played a central role in perpetuating the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that ultimately inspired a man to fire a gun in a Washington pizza joint. Pizzagate was predicated on the baseless story prominent Democrats were running a child sex ring out of the pizza place. Posobiec, a former Navy Reserve intelligence officer who now works for One America News Network, was previously the leader of a pro-Trump grassroots organisation.\n\nBeyond Posobiec, other well-known conspiracy theorists who spoke at the conference included anti-Muslim activist Laura Loomer, who\u2019s been banned from Facebook and Twitter.\n\nCharlie Kirk, the founder and president of the conservative youth advocacy group Turning Point USA (TPUSA), was also a speaker at the event. Kirk earlier this year took credit as Trump signed an executive order designed to protect free speech on college campuses. At a TPUSA event in late July, Trump delivered a speech in front of a fake presidential seal with Russian symbols on it, spending much of it attacking the media and his political opponents.\n\nAmerican Priority, much like TPUSA, portrays itself as a fierce defender of the First Amendment. And, much like TPUSA did following the fake presidential seal incident, American Priority is claiming it does not know how the fake Trump shooting video was shown at its conference.\n\n\u201cContent was submitted by third parties and was not associated with or endorsed by the conference in any official capacity,\u201d the event\u2019s organiser, Alex Phillips, told The Times. \u201cAmerican Priority rejects all political violence and aims to promote a healthy dialogue about the preservation of free speech. This matter is under review.\u201d\n\nThe White House has also tried to diminish any ties to the conference or video.\n\n\u201cRe: the video played over the weekend: The @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has not yet seen the video, he will see it shortly, but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a tweet.\n\nTrump was not in attendance at the American Priority event, but it was held at one of his properties that\u2019s been struggling financially since he entered the White House. Trump sparked controversy in August when he suggested the Doral resort be the location of the next G7 summit.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
