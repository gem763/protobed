I felt blindsided.\"\n\nThey announced they were throwing in the towel on their marriage in April last year, with a joint statement reading: \"We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"We fell deeply in love many years ago and have had a magical journey together. Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now.\"\n\nThey added that their number one priority continues to be what's best for little Everly.\n\nLater in 2018, Channing and Jessie were first linked - and their relationship went from there.\n\n(Image: FilmMagic)\n\nNow they've even moved in together in the English countryside near Bury St Edmunds.\n\nJenna, meanwhile, is pregnant with her second child - she's having a baby with boyfriend Steve Kazee.\n\nSteve's been gushing about his belle, and has hardly been able to contain his excitement.\n\nHe took to Instagram to write: \"Well...the news is out. I can't even begin to describe the feelings that I have had since we first learned that Jenna was pregnant!\n\n\"I have waited my entire life for this moment and couldn't have found a better person to build a family with. The past year and a half has brought so many things into my life that has filled me with the deepest of gratitude.\n\n\"A partner who radiates love, warmth and kindness. A partner who has faced some of the hardest moments life can deal you with grace, humility and a desire to learn from the ups and downs.\n\n\"A partner who is continuously growing from those lessons and who supports my growth as a person with love, unwavering support and understanding.\"", "description": "Jenna reveals in her new book that ex-husband Channing hadn't told her that he had moved on with singer Jessie", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Instagram", "Filmmagic"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645143.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Jenna-Dewan-says-she-felt-blindsided-after-learning-estranged-husband-Channing-Tatum-had-moved-on.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
