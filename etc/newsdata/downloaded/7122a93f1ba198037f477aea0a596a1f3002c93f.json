Landfills are said to be filled with unused company-branded T-shirts, tote bags, and plastic water bottles that conference attendees discard as soon as an event is over.\n\nBut Jon Alagem and Michael Scott Cohen have a radical idea. What if conference swag was something attendees actually wanted?\n\nSo they started Harper and Scott, an end-to-end design agency that creates branded items for the likes of Sephora, L'Oreal Paris, and Milk Bar. On Monday, the young agency announced it raised an undisclosed amount from Irving Place Capital comanaging partner John Howard and Coach chairman and former CEO Lew Frankfort with a $57.5 million valuation.\n\n\"Is not about the old style of tchotchkes and promotional items you throw away,\" Alagem told Business Insider. \"We create something special, and it's not any more expensive just because it's custom. We cut out the middlemen, so we do it for less.\"\n\nRead more: Vouch, a startup that provides insurance for other startups, raises $24.5 million from Ribbit Capital and Silicon Valley Bank in first outside financing round\n\nAlagem said that Harper and Scott did everything from creation and design of these items to manufacturing and delivery \u2014 processes that its clients used to outsource to several different outside suppliers. Manufacturing is logistically the most difficult for the small New York-based company, and Alagem said the escalating trade war between the US and China has caused the team to start exploring other options.\n\n\"When the tariffs first came out, we did something different. We told our clients that no matter what was in production now, we will eat the cost,\" Alagem said. \"That being said, we don't know what the future holds, so we are looking at expanding our manufacturing capabilities into other countries around the world.\"\n\nCohen told Business Insider Harper and Scott just hired an employee tasked with overseeing that effort in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, over the coming months. Other locations, like Peru, Mexico, and India, were also on the table as manufacturing hubs moving forward, Alagem said.\n\nSustainable swag for a new generation of consumers\n\nHarper and Scott produces branded products for the makeup giant Sephora, the real-estate startup Compass, the makeup brand L'Oreal Paris, and the massively popular dessert chain Milk Bar. Alagem said the thread uniting these unlikely companies was the desire to connect with younger customers.\n\nAs many companies with big brand names have realized, however, young millennials and Gen Zers are not only less loyal than older generations but also less likely to be wooed by inauthentic marketing attempts.\n\n\"The sustainability thing is more important because consumers are more educated about sustainability and where products come from,\" Cohen said. \"The other part is that branded merch is more valuable than any other marketing or ad strategy because the merchandise lives on a lot longer.\"\n\nAlagem added that many brands come to Harper and Scott asking for \"sustainable\" products without really knowing what that entails, so their team developed educational material to explain what responsible manufacturing looks like and how it partners with factories.\n\n\"In terms of sustainability, it's been a huge buzzword recently,\" Alagem said. \"Harper and Scott was at the forefront. We were sustainable before it was the popular thing to do.\"", "description": "The creative agency Harper and Scott says it offers companies like L'Oreal Paris a sustainable alternative to branded swag design and manufacturing.", "authors": ["Megan Hernbroth"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d840cf72e22af1ff146cee2-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
