I hope they can put it out,\" Mr Trump said, repeating that he had done nothing wrong in the latest scandal to shake his presidency.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\n\"The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption... and largely the fact that we don't want our people, like vice-president Biden and his son, creating... the corruption already in the Ukraine.\"\n\nMr Trump reportedly pressed Mr Zelensky about eight times on the call to investigate possible corruption involving Hunter Biden, who worked with a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father was vice-president.\n\nMr Biden told reporters on Saturday that Mr Trump's actions appeared \"to be an overwhelming abuse of power.\"\n\n\"I know what I'm up against, a serial abuser. That's what this guy is,\" Mr Biden said.\n\nIMPEACHMENT CALLS RETURN\n\nThe Democratic Party has been split on whether to push for impeachment proceedings against Mr Trump since he came to power in 2017.\n\nBut influential congressman Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, on Sunday said that his own reservations about impeachment were fading over Mr Trump's Ukraine call.\n\n\"We're talking about serious or flagrant abuse and potential violation of law,\" Mr Schiff told CNN.\n\n\"I have been very reluctant to go down the path of impeachment (but) the president is pushing us down this road.\n\n\"This seems different in kind, and we may very well have crossed the Rubicon here.\"\n\nThe Ukraine scandal mushroomed last week when Mr Schiff revealed the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, had refused to hand over the whistleblower complaint to Congress - the latest administration rebuff to Congressional oversight efforts.\n\nMr Maguire is scheduled to publicly testify before Mr Schiff's committee on Thursday.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, said Sunday that if Mr Trump's administration continued to block the complaint being released \"they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\"\n\nThe phone call, reportedly on July 25, came the day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress about his report that catalogued extensive contacts between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russians, including attempts to cooperate or collude - neither of which is a specific crime.\n\nIt also laid out in detail 10 instances when Mr Trump allegedly tried to obstruct the investigation, which Mr Trump dismissed as a \"big hoax\".\n\nMr Trump's senior staff swung behind him on Sunday. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNN that \"I don't have any reason to believe that the president pressured\" President Zelensky.\n\n\"People know there were issues that Biden's son did business in Ukraine. I, for one, have concerns about that,\" Mr Mnuchin said.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo told ABC that \"if vice-president Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened in a way that was corrupt, I think we need to get to the bottom of it.\"\n\nBut Republican Senator Mitt Romney, a regular critic of Mr Trump, said that any evidence of Mr Trump asking Ukraine's president to investigate Biden \"would be troubling in the extreme.\"\n\nMr Trump and Mr Zelensky will meet for the first time Wednesday at the UN General Assembly in New York.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] US President Donald Trump confirmed on Sunday that he discussed former vice-president Joe Biden and corruption allegations in a phone call with Ukraine's leader, adding to calls by Mr Trump's opponents for his impeachment. .
