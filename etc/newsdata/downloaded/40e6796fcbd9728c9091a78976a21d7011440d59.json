His exit follows that of fellow caster, and former pro-player Brian Kibler, who has also withdrawn from the finals and all current Grandmaster events.\n\n\u2018Blitzchung\u2019s actions to support Hong Kong speak to me far more than I could have imagined. It takes courage to stand up for what you believe in, and to make sacrifices in the process. His actions are inspiring to me, and I support him wholeheartedly,\u2019 wrote Zamora on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018For me, this is a large part of my livelihood. This is my passion. This pursuit has been my life, and I\u2019m lucky that I\u2019ve been able to make it a career. But I cannot compromise my conviction. Without change that would convince me that Blizzard will uphold their core value \u201cEvery Voice Matters\u201d, I cannot continue casting the game.\u2019\n\nMy statement regarding Blitzchung, Hearthstone Grandmasters, and Blizzard.
