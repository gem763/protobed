And so far, it\u2019s kind of worked.\n\nEndorsements from big names like Elon Musk, along with many small individual donations from software engineers\u2014among the biggest givers to his campaign\u2014have catapulted him into the middle of the winnowing pack of remaining Democratic candidates. He\u2019s managed to win over the tech industry\u2019s support while making its negative impact on society his central focus, and he\u2019ll be on the debate stage on Thursday night, trying to convince everyone he can fix it.\n\nAn outsider with zero political experience, Yang has outlasted a senator, two governors and three members of the House in the crowded Democratic field. He\u2019s currently beating two senators, former liberal heartthrob Beto O\u2019Rourke and Tom Steyer, the billionaire burning through his own cash while floundering in the polls. And Yang\u2019s fundraising and poll numbers were strong enough to qualify for nationally televised debates three times.\n\nBut it\u2019s the next phase that proves trickiest, in both tech and politics. Yang, who is currently at 2.5% in a Real Clear Politics aggregation of polls, needs to scale up quickly, building more name recognition and financial support before the primary season starts. In short, it\u2019s time for Yang to go public.\n\nHis plan to do so involves a campaign centered on one big idea: a $1,000 check sent monthly to every U.S. citizen over the age of 18, no strings attached. But he\u2019s also touting more than 150 other proposals such as legalizing marijuana, creating a postal banking system, paying college athletes, eliminating the penny and making Puerto Rico a state.\n\nIt\u2019s those ideas that make more traditional pundits view Yang as a fringe candidate\u2014Yang is undoubtedly the first presidential campaign to have taken a stance on circumcision, even if he later backtracked on it. But an embrace of oddball causes may also be part of the secret to Yang\u2019s success so far.\n\nConnor Farrell, a progressive fundraising consultant for Left Rising in Washington, D.C., said that Yang\u2019s campaign features the kind of niche ideas with passionate fan bases that drive online donations. Those voters can be reached much more efficiently through free viral videos and memes than can, say, potential supporters of former Vice President Joe Biden who prioritize electability. And they\u2019re easier to convert into small-dollar donors who can be tapped again and again, Farrell said.\n\n\u201cCandidates who advertise about a specific issue have an easier time targeting the people that are likely to give to them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll make more money spending less money.\u201d\n\nYang recently sat down with Bloomberg in a cramped conference room in San Francisco to talk about his ideas. Surrounded by stacks of his book The War on Normal People, the former tech entrepreneur quickly launched into his case that the tech sector bears responsibility for many of America\u2019s problems.\n\nRetail jobs vaporizing and shopping malls closing? That\u2019s Amazon. Suicide and mental health issues on the rise? That\u2019s Facebook. Journalism on the decline? Google\u2019s ad network carries a bunch of responsibility for that.\n\nAnd, he argues, there\u2019s worse to come, as automation comes for clerical, call center, retail, food preparation and trucking jobs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not immigrants causing these problems,\u201d Yang said, in counterpoint to President Donald Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s technology.\u201d\n\nAnd then he turns to his solution, which his campaign calls the Freedom Dividend but Yang informally describes as a \u201ctech check.\u201d To help pay for its estimated cost of about $255 billion per month, he wants to ditch corporate taxes on earnings and instead institute a value-added tax, or VAT, a tax on consumption. The VAT is used by a majority of developed counties, but is considered a non-starter in the U.S. for both parties: Republicans look at it as a tax hike, and Democrats believe it\u2019s regressive because poor people\u2019s consumption represents more of their income. Yang argues that if the tax were set at 10% (or about half the amount Europe charges) it would easily cover his $12,000 annual stipend for every American.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- It\u2019s a classic Silicon Valley story: A shoestring operation disrupts the way business has traditionally been done, smashing experts\u2019 expectations while drawing wary glances from sober-minded analysts.Except this time the product isn\u2019t some new gadget or app, it\u2019s a presidential candidate", "authors": ["Lizette Chapman", "Ryan Beckwith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ga1XyO9fBqqKCmanKTwBcw--~B/aD0yNTQyO3c9MzgzMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/cba6fcd6e3efb8c3e4f89d442c825b69", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
