It\u2019s a trend that appears to have been sparked by Walmart, whose CEO Doug McMillon announced the decision on Tuesday following a string of mass shootings around the country \u2014 including the Aug. 3 shooting in which 22 were killed at a Walmart store in El Paso, Tex.\n\nMcMillon announced on Tuesday that Walmart would stop selling handguns and military-style rifles. In the same statement, he requested that customers no longer openly carry firearms into Walmart stores. Several other chains have followed suit. As of Friday, Kroger, CVS, Walgreens and Wegmans had all issued similar statements of their own.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing more important than the safety of our customers & employees. The sight of someone with a gun can be alarming, and we don\u2019t want anyone to feel that way at Wegmans. For this reason, we prefer that customers not openly carry firearms into our stores. \u2014 Wegmans Food Markets (@Wegmans) September 5, 2019\n\nCVS Health Updates Firearms in Stores Policy pic.twitter.com/0ODx6ewJNX \u2014 CVS Health (@CVSHealth) September 5, 2019\n\nGiven the potential ambiguity of their language \u2014 that the chains are \u201crequesting\u201d customers leave guns at home, and \u201cprefer\u201d not to see weapons carried \u2014 the statements bring into question exactly how store employees will go about enforcing their new guidelines. \u201cAsking customers not to openly carry firearms in stores isn\u2019t exactly a policy,\u201d says David Yamane, a sociologist at Wake Forest University and expert in American gun culture and policy. \u201cYou haven\u2019t prohibited [it] from happening.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is more clarity, so employees and customers aren\u2019t confused, Yamane says. \u201cPeople can say, \u2018This is just a request. I can carry until you tell me not to.'\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Walmart tells TIME that management will soon receive guidance and training on exactly how to deal with customers who walk in to a store with a weapon. While it\u2019s unlikely that a Walmart employee be tasked with stopping customer to check if they have a gun (and asking them to leave if so), Walmart store managers will apparently be tasked with judging each situation on its own merits.\n\nFor example, if a person, or even multiple people, are carrying firearms openly in a store but other customers and associates don\u2019t report feeling unsafe, a store manager could allow them to continue carrying the guns. If people report feeling uncomfortable, however, managers would follow various protocols to resolve the situation, the spokesperson said.\n\nAt CVS, the details on its new announcement are still being hammered out, according to a company spokesperson. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that we neither expect nor encourage employees to confront a customer who chooses to enter a store with a firearm,\u201d a statement provided to TIME reads.\n\nRepresentatives for Kroger and Walgreens did not immediately answer TIME\u2019s request for comment; a spokesperson for Wegmans declined to comment.\n\nJeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, says that as private businesses, Walmart and other stores have the right to post signage completely banning firearms and to enforce that rule through trespassing laws and other regulations. \u201cThere\u2019s no guaranteed second amendment in private property,\u201d he says.\n\nSonnenfeld speculates that, noting that instead of going that route right away, the stores are \u201cgoing to try the voluntary approach at first and see if that works.\u201d\n\nFor the moment, then, the stores are essentially politely asking people to leave their guns at home before heading to buy food or pick up prescriptions. Whether the policy changes will likely depend on how shoppers react, Yamane adds.\n\n\u201cMost gun owners are responsible and respectful of fellow citizens, and if Walmart doesn\u2019t want them to openly carry, they won\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have a small minority of people who will openly carry rifles because in any group of people, you\u2019ll have people at an extreme who will test those limits.\u201d", "description": "Chains across the U.S. have asked customers not to openly carry firearms in their stores.
