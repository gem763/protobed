Their finest export however, may be a group of guys that go by the name The Glorious Sons.\n\nThe Glorious Sons are a rock and roll band from Ontario that has had amazing success on Canadian radio and is now tackling the United States and Europe. Two brothers and three others formed the unit in 2011. Lead singer and guitar player Brett Emmons sums up his decision to join the band. \u201cI quit all my classes and decided I was going to be a musician.\u201d He acknowledges he wasn\u2019t having much success pursuing a solo career so he accepted an offer from his brother to join the fledgling act.\n\n\u201cWe jammed every night and some kind of spark hit. It was easy after that.\u201d says Emmons.\n\nEasy is a relative term of course. The Glorious Sons practiced tirelessly and began to develop a following in their native Kingston, Ontario. Some describe their music as traditional rock n roll. As it turns out, their path to success borrowed a page from the classic rock playbook as well. They played a lot live. They wrote music and recorded an EP on their own. They pitched a song called \u201cMama\u201d to local Canadian rock stations, many of whom agreed to give the music a shot.\n\nIn the golden years of rock, that was a familiar story. Bon Jovi recorded a song on their own and convinced local radio to play it. Rick Ocasek from The Cars took a copy of their music around to Boston radio stations, hoping to earn airplay. Both bands are now in the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nEmmons explains how The Glorious Sons managed to convince radio to play their music without even having a record deal. \u201cWe were #6 on Canadian radio without a label at all. We ended up with management and a label of course. It just wasn\u2019t that tough for us.\u201d Once people started hearing their song \u201cMama\u201d on the radio, they wanted to see the band live and once people saw the band live, they wanted even more.\n\n\u201cWe knew we just had to play shows and we could turn heads that way. To be honest, we were very lucky that Canadian radio jumped on our first single and played it. They played it to death.\u201d\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t be the last time the band charted. The initial success brought them a record deal and thus began a string of eleven top 20 singles on Canadian radio, including three number one songs.\n\nIn the last couple of years the band has started to break though on US radio as well. Money and fame are not what motivate The Glorious Sons however. They play because they love the music. Emmons says \u201cWe have no choice. It is a decision you make in your bedroom when you\u2019re 15 years old. All that other stuff - money and fame - that\u2019s an after thought.\u201d\n\nThe band has just released a new album, A War on Everything, which has already yielded a number one single and is being very well received, by critics and fans alike. \u201cThis one was so easy\u201d says Emmons. \u201cWe had so much momentum coming into this album. We were finishing our first stadium tour. I was writing so much every day. Nothing could hurt my voice.\u201d\n\nThat voice, like the guitars, cowbell and harmonica that accompany it, is raw and full of emotion. It is a primary reason their music connects so well with their fans. The band\u2019s dedication to its craft doesn\u2019t hurt either. \u201cWe got in there and were in the studio for 30 days, 14 hours, sometimes 16 hours in the studio. It was just a pleasure to be there. One of the best experiences of my life.\u201d\n\nThe entire album is strong. One tune filled with irony is titled, \u201cThe Ongoing Speculation into the Death of Rock n Roll.\u201d Despite the fact the band has been playing together eight years, starting in bars and growing into stadiums, Emmons says he is constantly questioned about the state of rock n roll. \u201cYou can go into any given club in your respective cities around the country and you\u2019ll still see people playing electric guitar and screaming their heads off as loud as they can. Of course it\u2019s in a good state.\u201d\n\n\u201cA War on Everything\u201d features music that covers the full gamut of emotion and experience. Emmons says there are some negative dark themes (Panic Attack) but there are a few songs that make the album a little lighter and offer a glimmer of hope (Lean on Me). He emphasizes that his songs are intended to be relatable to people and he hits the target. The tune \u201cLove and War\u201d with lyrics that include \u201cIt just hurts \u2018cuz you\u2019re not mad anymore, oh we never learned the laws of love and war\u201d reach into the soul of anyone who has ever had a heart-wrenching romantic break up.\n\nThe album is a success lyrically, musically and if the #1 status of Panic Attack is an indicator, is on track for commercial success as well. While he hopes for the best, Emmons is not hung up on chart position or the number of units sold. \u201cFor anybody in this industry, we\u2019ve all got a big hole in our chest and at the end of the day you\u2019re just trying to fill it and be happy with what you\u2019re doing.\u201d He pauses and then adds confidently, \u201cWe\u2019re very happy.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
