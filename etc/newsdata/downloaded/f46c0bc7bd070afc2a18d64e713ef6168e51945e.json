In other words, she is the first party and owner of the building.", "description": "Jiang Yiyan, an actress from the Chinese mainland, aroused heated debate on social media platform Sina Weibo as news came out that she was awarded an Architecture MasterPrize (AMP) at a ceremony in Spain a few days ago.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/23/5db0198ba310cf3e97a29eb6.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
