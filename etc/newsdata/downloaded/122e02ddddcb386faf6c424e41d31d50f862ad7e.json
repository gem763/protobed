REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\n\nThe so-called backstop mechanism to uphold the seamless Irish border after Brexit has proven a key obstacle to agreeing an EU-UK divorce deal, which stalled after British lawmakers rejected it.\n\nWith Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowing to take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31 - deal or no deal - the bloc has focused in recent days on a Northern Ireland-only backstop as the best chance of getting a deal before the deadline lapses.\n\n\u201cWe want an agreement but we are aware that an agreement without a backstop wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d the new head of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, told a news conference in Brussels.\n\n\u201cWe are willing to go back to the original EU proposal which is that a backstop will only be added for Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nThe EU saw a possible opening in Johnson\u2019s comments signalling that he was willing to preserve an all-Ireland economy for checks on animals and food products, a single electricity market and travel zone.\n\nJohnson\u2019s spokesman has since said London was not seeking a Northern Ireland-only backstop.\n\nAsked if that meant the option was dead, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said nothing had been taken off the table.\n\n\u201cWe will respond positively if there are suggestions and new approaches that are based on realism in terms of what will actually work,\u201d Coveney said. \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see what the British government brings forward.\u201d\n\nCLOSING THE GAP?\n\nSpeaking a day after Britain\u2019s Brexit negotiator David Frost held a third round of EU talks in two weeks, both Coveney and Sassoli said the UK had so far presented no feasible, legally sound and detailed plan to replace the backstop.\n\nThe EU\u2019s twin ambition is to preserve the open Irish border, the only land frontier between the EU and the UK after Brexit, and ensure that it does not open the bloc\u2019s single market to illicit products sold at dumping prices.\n\nAll sides fear reinstating controls on the Irish border could threaten the fragile peace since 1998 after decades of sectarian strife.\n\nBut Johnson and many others in the United Kingdom oppose the backstop, fearing it would trap the country in a permanent customs union with the EU.\n\nThe narrower option is anathema to the Northern Irish unionist DUP party that backs Johnson\u2019s minority government and fears it would split their region from the rest of the country.\n\nA UK government spokesman said after the latest EU-UK talks, that are due to continue on Friday: \u201cFor a deal to be done, the anti-democratic backstop must be removed.\n\n\u201cThe UK presented ideas in the areas of customs and manufactured goods and we had further exchanges on the political declaration.\u201d\n\nLondon\u2019s ideas for \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to the backstop include streamlined customs arrangements and thoughts on how to manage varying regulations on industrial goods. But the bloc is unconvinced that these solutions would work.\n\nSpeaking at an annual meeting of Ireland\u2019s ruling Fine Gael party, Coveney said, to date, the British government had offered \u201cnothing that comes close\u201d to what is needed to secure Irish and EU agreement. But Johnson has shown a \u201cwillingness to try and explore new approaches,\u201d Coveney told reporters.\n\nMore than three years since Britons voted to leave the EU and with just seven weeks to go, the British government and parliament are locked in conflict over Brexit, with possible outcomes ranging from leaving without a deal to holding another referendum.", "description": "The European Union has pressed Britain to give Northern Ireland special status within the bloc's trading orbit to unlock a Brexit deal, with Dublin promising a positive response should London shift its position.", "authors": ["Conor Humphries", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429107870&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0SD"}
