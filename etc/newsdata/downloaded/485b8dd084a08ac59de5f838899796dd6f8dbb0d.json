It's done all the time.'\n\n\"There is an investigation going on with the Department of Justice, we all know this -- Bill Barr announced it,\" Levin later added.\n\nHe said Trump would like the Ukrainian government as well as officials in Italy and Australia to cooperate with Attorney General Barr and Connecticut federal prosecutor John Durham, the man Barr appointed to investigate the origins of the Russia investigation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Why is this a scandal? Why is this a problem? It's not,\" Levin said. \"Why are the media so defensive of the Democrats and the Democratic Party?
