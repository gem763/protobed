We must act. If we do not act people will lose their beach houses. Plants will wither and die. Birds will fall from the sky. Just last week whole communities in the Caribbean were swept away.\n\nThere are, however, problems with eliminating or ameliorating climate change. For one thing, modern technology cannot seem to keep up with peoples\u2019 ability to dream. Daydreams outpace technology every time. Dream up a problem such as climate change, and I will guarantee you that it will be years before climate change is solved by technology. Though when I ponder some of the solutions now being offered for climate change, it might be worth the wait.\n\nConsider Congressgirl Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She has dreamed up a vast scheme. She calls it the \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d It envisages all our homes and office buildings and even factories being revised and rebuilt according to her green code. Others are more moderate. They would only wipe out the commercial airline industry, though the automobile industry could be next. Already there is an ambitious plan afoot in our country to end the life of the plastic straw.\n\nOh, yes, there is another problem with climate change. It is not a winning issue with the electorate. Any government that attempts this sort of Green Adventure almost immediately falls. I cannot think of a country on Earth whose majority supports climate change legislation. Possibly, in the Vatican there is a majority that supports climate change legislation. We know the pope favors it. Yet, I would say that the Vatican is not a conventional democracy.\n\nAustralia is a conventional democracy, and climate change legislation has not done very well in Australia. There have been seven governments in recent years that came to power in Australia, and all in one way or another came a cropper because of climate change. The most famous example of a climate changer being defeated by a climate change denier in Australia was in 2013. In that election, Kevin Rudd, who ran on a platform of carbon taxes, was demolished by Tony Abbott, who once referred to climate change activism as crap. He sounds downright Trumpian to me.\n\nLast Wednesday, we saw the Democrats\u2019 lonely crowd of candidates traipse across a stage for a ghostly pageant hosted by CNN. The network finished dead last that night in the ratings with the other two cable news channels elbowing CNN aside. The network\u2019s average audience during the seven-hour event was a measly 1.1 million viewers. The topic for the seven-hour spectacular (yes, seven-hour) was climate change. Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN, apparently thought it was the major issue with the Democratic hopefuls, and obviously they agreed.\n\nGaffable Joe Biden, Pocahontas, Comrade Bernie Sanders and all the rest arrived on stage Wednesday night to talk about climate change all night long if need be. They compared it to World War II. They compared it to cancer. They blamed it for wars already in progress and wars in the future. One ludicrous comparison was between climate change and overpopulation. The wretched of Africa could be saved by Planned Parenthood\u2019s arrival in the Dark Continent, all wearing pith helmets and garb from L.L. Bean.\n\nFrankly, the Democrats\u2019 obsession with climate change is more than odd. It is delusional. As The American Spectator\u2019s Hunt Lawrence and Daniel J. Flynn wrote in commenting on the Wednesday night revels, not climate change but health care \u201cmatters to voters in a real, tangible way, and not in an abstract sense like climate change.\u201d Health care consumes 18 percent of the American budget, trending upward toward 20 percent by mid-decade. Americans now spend $3.5 trillion or so on health care with the federal, state and local government footing 45 percent of the bill. How will we pay for it in 2025? The subject was not even discussed last Wednesday by the leading Democratic contenders.\n\nMessrs. Lawrence and Flynn are putting their money on health care not climate change as an issue in 2020.\n\n\u2022 R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr. is founder and editor in chief of The American Spectator.
