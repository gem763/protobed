On a tour of the show, Magliozzi suggested that amateur movies can constitute a \u201crecord of diversity and difference\u201d that Hollywood films of the equivalent time periods often worked to obscure.\n\nOne of the highlights is a loop of nearly three hours of home movies by the Jarret family of Pittsburgh. There is nothing overtly special about much of what they depict \u2014 birthdays and other celebrations, family members dancing at home , an excursion to a beach or a ride on a roller coaster \u2014 but for the fact that these films (and probably not too many others) serve as a record of life in Pittsburgh\u2019s historically African-American Hill District from 1958 to 1967.\n\nMany of the movies in this exhibition were not stored carefully over the years, and the degradation of this particular film, shot on 8-millimeter, is in its own way poignant, an almost literal illustration of the concept of erasure. At times, the image dissolves into a Jackson Pollock-like abstraction. During a fall street festival, residents of the Hill District and the scenery of the neighborhood compete with the imperfections of the film stock.", "description": "\u201cPrivate Lives Public Spaces\u201d is a thought-provoking show of neglected footage from the museum\u2019s collection.
