Leon seemed to have concluded that the biggest challenge for the DA \u2013 at least going into the 2004 elections \u2013 was how the DA was perceived with regard to race, and less with regard to ideology.\n\nThis meant that if the DA could solve the fundamental problem of its racial make-up, it could solve its problem of growth without sacrificing its liberal values.\n\nLeon then decided that in the 2004 party list of the DA, more black faces needed to be on that list.\n\nHis simplistic thinking was that as soon as black people saw other blacks in the DA, they would vote for the party and become members without asking more fundamental question of ideology.\n\nThe DA core liberal members and funders tolerated Leon\u2019s experimental leadership as long as it brought growth and did not veer away from liberal values. They did the same with Zille. What they could not tolerate was veering away form liberal values and still losing electoral support \u2013 that was too much.\n\nThis did not seem to succeed much and the DA knew that it needed to articulate some version of its ideology, otherwise it would have no message for its campaigns.\n\nLoosely defined slogans such as \u201cOpen opportunity society for all\u201d, and \u201cOne party for all\u201d, seemed to be the best compromise as a message that they could present to South Africa and would hopefully be accepted by both core liberals and the new black members.\n\nAlthough all other parties were in fact for all South Africans (except Andile Mngxitama\u2019s recent Black First Land First), the DA message depended on the racist tradition where integration is defined as a one-way street, blacks assimilating to whites.\n\nThe DA was also perceived as governing well compared to the ANC and this also helped them integrate better with the black middle class which was disillusioned with an ANC that was now perceived in the opposite fashion.\n\nIt was however inevitable that once the ANC turned the corner on governance, corruption and other negative perceptions and tendencies, this would take away all the distinguishing factors that had attracted blacks to the DA as an alternative and the conversation of what exactly the party stood for would ensue.\n\nMaimane, as leader of the party began to publicly claim that he was a liberal.\n\nWhat that meant he did not seem to comprehend very well, especially when he would then espouse interventionist redistribute and anti-inequality policies of an activist government, the antithesis to liberalism.\n\nAnother DA leader, Phumzile van Damme, sought to qualify her ideology by saying she in fact was also a liberal, but a social liberal, as opposed to classical liberal.\n\nThus began the confusion of both ideology and policy in the DA.\n\nWhat did the DA think of affirmative action, BEE, executive pay and the death penalty? With answers pitting black leaders on one side and white leaders on the other, divisions widened.\n\nRead: Double whammy for DA as Maimane and Trollip resign\n\nBritish writer George Monbiot summed up liberalism when he said: \u201cNever mind structural unemployment: if you don\u2019t have a job it\u2019s because you are unenterprising. Never mind the impossible costs of housing: if your credit card is maxed out, you\u2019re feckless and improvident. Never mind that your children no longer have a school playing field: if they get fat, it\u2019s your fault. In a world governed by competition, those who fall behind become defined and self-defined as losers. Neoliberalism can be summed up as an ideology of massive corporate tax cuts, the crushing of trade unions, deregulation, privatisation, outsourcing and competition in public services. That\u2019s about the size of it.\u201d\n\nPresented this way, no black person in their right mind would ever vote for a liberal party.\n\nThat was however not a question the DA was willing to engage in 2004 when Leon launched his party list in 2004 and in 2007, when Zille took over.\n\nThe goal was to use the available tools to allow the DA to change its racial perception, through imposing black party leaders, while keeping its liberal ideology.\n\nGiving blacks leadership positions, who in all likelihood could never be classical liberals, while keeping the party power in the hands of the white liberals was not a very sustainable strategy but would suffice at the time.\n\nThere was only one way to achieve this black leader-liberal ideology goal: federalism.\n\n\u201cFederalism, by form and content, refers to a system in which there is constitutionally established sharing of authority between different layers of leadership. Not managed well, there will always be a crippling tension between the sprawling bureaucracy of the federal executive and the party\u2019s government apparatus. Federalism is usually more than just a preferred model of government but more often than not is as a result of pressures from minority nationalism.\u201d\n\nIf the party wanted to be black-led while power remained with white liberals, it would have to make sure the federal structure, or at least it\u2019s chairperson, was white and it\u2019s not open to too much contestation (so it should not go to congress) and the federal structure would have to be presented as the background structure which exists only to support the leader.\n\n\n\nSmart black leaders however, who could see through the facade began to rebel, against this imposed white liberalism via federalism.\n\nIn fact, this was racism, where whites still thought of themselves as superior to blacks to ever allow blacks to truly lead, despite desperately needing the black votes.\n\nBlack leaders themselves would have to be conscientised, on a daily basis, just how generous whites had been for giving them leadership positions in a white party, how superior white leaders\u2019 ideas are to black leaders and that they should never forget to be grateful.\n\nLindiwe Mazibuko, it\u2019s former parliamentary leader, would be the first high-profile black leader to be a casualty of black leaders who actually thought they could lead and call the shots.\n\nIn January 2016, now outside the DA, Mazibuko wrote a scathing piece on the racial dynamics in her former party.\n\nWhat they could not tolerate was veering away from liberal values and still losing electoral support \u2013 that was too much.\n\nIn one of the comments she said: \u201cThe DA should also reflect on hurtful and inaccurate internal party narratives that presume \u2018white competence\u2019, while labelling black leaders products of the generosity of their white counterparts.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe DA core liberal members and funders tolerated Leon\u2019s experimental leadership as long as it brought growth and did not veer away from liberal values.\n\nThey did the same with Zille.\n\nWhat they could not tolerate was veering away from liberal values and still losing electoral support \u2013 that was too much.\n\nAt its federal council, the party had a choice, to either return to its classical liberal values with a new leader, or continue with Maimane, whose rhetoric did not espouse liberal values and was also losing the DA electoral support.\n\n\n\nThe choice of Zille as federal council chairperson meant that the party decided to return to its classical liberal values, that would not address race, inequality, injustices of the past, BEE and other social policies, leaving Maimane with no other choice but to resign.\n\nThis should be a lesson to all black leaders in the DA.\n\nDiko is media strategist and political commentator", "description": "The DA experienced a \u201cBlack Wednesday\u201d, a bedlam in Nkululeko House, in a week during which all the pillars that held the organisation together and gave it legitimacy came crumbling down.", "authors": ["Yonela Diko"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9522/622f572aac774707818ce0f981f32f38.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
