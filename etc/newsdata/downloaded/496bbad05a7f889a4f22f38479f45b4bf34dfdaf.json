More than 3,000 delegates, hailing from nearly every country in the world are expected to resolve an ongoing turf war over highly prized radio frequency bands used by meteorologists and coveted by cellphone companies. It\u2019s all going down at the World Radiocommunication Conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where guidelines on the contested frequencies will be decided.\n\nProminent scientists have already rung the alarm bells on the debut of 5G wireless networks, which promise customers faster internet speeds. The worry is that the rollout could inadvertently throw off weather forecasting, they say, because 5G networks are planning to use a frequency band very close to the one satellites use to observe water vapor. That interference could cost lives and fortunes when it comes to preparing for disastrous weather events.\n\ninterference could cost lives and fortunes\n\nCell service providers make a lot of big claims when it comes to 5G, the next generation of mobile broadband. Previous generations of cellular wireless technology, like 4G and LTE, operate along lower radio frequencies. But it\u2019s getting crowded down there. To achieve the superfast speeds, 5G will need to be able to operate at frequencies higher than what existing 4G and LTE are using. One of those frequency bands is just above 24GHz. But just under 24GHz is the frequency at which water vapor molecules emit a little bit of a radio signal, and that\u2019s what makes it so valuable to scientists who are studying the weather. They\u2019re worried that 5G could be a noisy neighbor, unintentionally leaking signals into bands next door, which could interfere with their ability to monitor water vapor. Studying water vapor is important for predicting the trajectory of storms, forecasting sunny weather or rain, and keeping tabs on the changing climate.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in any way painted as anti 5G, we just want everybody to be good neighbors,\u201d says Stephen English, a meteorologist at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in the United Kingdom. \u201cWe want to come to a good agreement [in Egypt] where everybody can carry out the services they want to carry out without interference or problems from their neighbors.\u201d\n\n\u201cwe just want everybody to be good neighbors.\u201d\n\nTo keep 5G from interfering with forecasting, English and other scientists have pushed for strict limits on the noise that 5G devices are allowed to generate outside of the 24GHz channel. But the US Federal Communications Commission has proposed much less stringent limits, even though concerns over the potential threats to science and public safety have been mounting ever since the FCC decided in March to auction off that part of the radio spectrum. The FCC issues licenses to entities using the airwaves in the United States, and under Chairman Ajit Pai, it has made auctioning off licenses for high-band radio spectrum a priority as part of its goal of securing US leadership in 5G technology.\n\nIn May, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) head Neil Jacobs told Congress that the FCC\u2019s proposed interference limits could roll back 40 years of progress on weather forecasting and result in satellites losing nearly 80 percent of the data they\u2019re able to collect now. The resulting inaccuracy could mean real consequences for people on the ground. \u201cIf you can\u2019t make that prediction accurately, then you end up not evacuating the right people and/or you evacuate people that don\u2019t need to evacuate, which is a problem,\u201d NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told Congress in April.\n\nRep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX), who chairs the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, wrote two letters to the FCC in September and October demanding that the agency provide the scientific analysis behind its decision to propose weaker interference limits. The FCC has yet to respond to her requests. \u201cI am left to assume that the FCC has no science-based evidence to support its position,\u201d Johnson said in an October 23rd statement. The FCC did not respond to a request for comment from The Verge.\n\nThe United States will bring its position on allowing more lax limits to the conference in Egypt where international guidelines will be formalized. The meeting is convened every three or four years by the United Nations International Telecommunication Union to review and revise radio regulations. As the summit began, President Trump addressed a letter to the secretary-general of the International Telecommunications Union saying, \u201cWe intend to cooperate with like-minded nations to promote security in all aspects of 5G networks worldwide.\u201d\n\nNegotiations begin on Monday, October 28th, and will run through November 22nd. It\u2019ll also tackle the growing demand for radio spectrum used to provide internet connection to \u201cmoving targets\u201d like planes and ships. The last conference in 2015 was marked with tough debates on which frequencies to earmark for drones.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a very difficult meeting. You can imagine negotiations going on right through the night, through the next day,\u201d English tells The Verge. But unlike previous conferences, many regional players are coming into this year\u2019s negotiations with established positions. The Inter-American Telecommunication Commission, which includes the United States and 34 other countries across the Americas has proposed emissions limits closer to the FCC\u2019s proposal than the much stricter limits that the meteorological community is looking for. So the outlook in Egypt so far is grim for those hoping for stronger protections from the potential interference 5G could pose to weather forecasting. \u201cI\u2019m not terribly optimistic of a good outcome,\u201d English says.\n\na precedent for other prized frequencies\n\nOn top of all that\u2019s at stake when it comes to 24GHz, the decision coming out of Egypt could also set a precedent for other prized frequencies as the radio spectrum becomes more crowded. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a one and done with 24GHz. We could be having similar discussions about a few other important bands,\u201d says Jordan Gerth, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. That\u2019s because satellites use other high-frequency bands to study things like clouds and air temperature.\n\nStill, even if less stringent interference limits are adopted in Egypt, the worst-case scenarios that meteorologists are worried about won\u2019t come about immediately. 5G hasn\u2019t been widely deployed because the technology and infrastructure to make good on its promises just aren\u2019t there yet. But that tech is slowly being built up, and more developments loom on the horizon. \u201cIn the future, we\u2019re going to have 6G, we\u2019re going to have all sorts of people chasing a spectrum,\u201d English says. That\u2019s one reason why experts are placing a lot of weight on this 5G decision in Egypt. The outcome of this battle, English says, will be an early signal of how much world leaders value science and could show whether they will be willing to protect their science in the future.", "description": "Heated negotiations will begin in Egypt this week that could decide the future of 5G and weather forecasting.
