You talk so much about individual responsibility. Most of us are never going to be able to afford to have all of these assets over which we can have all of this responsibility. So, what is your advice, beyond banal comments like clean your room?\u201d\n\nBefore Mr. Peterson could respond, another member of his panel interrupted and said, \u201cTry answering the question on the collective responsibility for climate change, for example \u2026 Because I think the argument is that individual responsibility does not change the climate and does not fix the problem that needs global collective responsibility.\u201d\n\nMr. Jordan answered, \u201cFundamentally I am a psychologist, and my experience has been that people can do a tremendous amount of good for themselves and the people around them by looking to their own inadequacies and their own flaws and the things that they\u2019re not doing in their lives and starting to build themselves up as more powerful individuals. If they\u2019re capable of doing that, then they are capable of expanding their career.\n\n\u201cAnd, if they are capable of expanding their career and their competence, then they\u2019re capable of taking their place in the community as effective leaders. And, then, they are capable of making wise decisions instead of unwise [choices] when it comes to making collective decisions. I am not suggesting in the least that there is no domain for social action. I am suggesting that people who don\u2019t have their own houses in order should be very careful before they go about reorganizing the world.\u201d\n\nAnd, thus, in just these few short sentences, Mr. Peterson offers this young woman (and everyone else listening in) some of the best advice she has likely ever received.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have your act together, stop deflecting.\n\nStop the transference.\n\nStop trying to make yourself look good by blaming others.\n\nShow some respect. Take responsibility.\n\nChange yourself before you try to change everyone else!\n\nLose weight before you complain about the world being fat.\n\nStop overeating before you blame overconsumption for \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\nStop using planes, trains and automobiles before you condemn the world for its use of fossil fuels.\n\nStart paying more taxes before you try to increase mine.\n\nGive more of your own money to the poor before you call me greedy.\n\nRemove the lock from your front door before you presume to lecture others about open borders.\n\nIf sanctuary cities are so good, prove it. Start with your own home and fill it with illegal immigrants before preaching to the rest of us about how walls are sinful.\n\nShouting duplicitous nonsense about tolerance and love when, at the same time, you are screaming, \u201cI can\u2019t tolerate your intolerance\u201d and \u201cI hate hateful people\u201d is not a winning argument. Your hypocrisy results in few converts.\n\nClaiming to be a champion of diversity and inclusion while working so hard to silence your political opponents, smacks of being two-faced and insincere. You are scoring no points by marching for freedom while waving your banner of fascism.\n\nThe problem starts with who you see in the mirror, not who you see out your window.\n\nRevival always begins with repentance. It never starts with rebuke.\n\nThe seeds of revolution are integrity and sacrifice, not self-righteous and personal smugness.\n\nJohn Newton didn\u2019t say, \u201cAmazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like \u2018you.\u2019\u201d He stopped selling slaves before he ever thought of condemning anyone else for slavery.\n\nIntegrity assumes you actually care enough to practice what you preach.\n\nUntil you realize this, no one will ever take you seriously.\n\nIf you want to be treated like an adult, stop acting like an insolent child.\n\n\u201cWhy do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother\u2019s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, \u2018Let me take the speck out of your eye,\u2019 when all the time there is a plank in your own? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother\u2019s \u2026\n\n\u201c[E]very good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit \u2026 [B]y their fruit you will recognize them. Not everyone who says to me, \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, \u2018[D]id we not [march for tolerance, inclusion, and social justice] in your name?\u2019 Then I will tell them plainly, \u2018I never knew you. [Get] away from me!\u2019\u201d \u2014 Jesus.\n\n\u2022 Everett Piper, former president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, is a columnist for The Washington Times and author of \u201cNot A Day Care: The Devastating Consequences of Abandoning Truth\u201d (Regnery 2017).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
