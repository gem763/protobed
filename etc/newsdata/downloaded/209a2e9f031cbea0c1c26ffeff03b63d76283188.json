However, it would result in an average 53 percent increase in electricity costs and a 20 percent rise in gasoline costs compared to projected 2030 prices, the report found.\n\nDespite the political pitfalls involved in implementing the tax, it would also generate revenue nearly equivalent to 1 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, which could be given back to American consumers.\n\nThe proposed tax would also affect countries differently based on their burning or exporting of coal, the report found. In nations such as China, India and South Africa, a $75 carbon tax could reduce emissions by 45 percent.\n\nIn South Africa\u2019s case, it could raise as high as 3.5 percent of the country\u2019s GDP, the IMF found.\n\nAmong the 20 largest global economies, the tax would raise electricity costs by an average of 43 percent and 14 percent for gasoline.\n\nMarc Hafstead, a climate policy expert with Resources for the Future, told the Post that the tax is \u201cthe single most powerful tool we have\u201d for reducing carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cNo environmental economist should disagree with the main argument of the paper: Carbon pricing is the single most powerful tool we have for reducing CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels, and our current set of policies leaves us nowhere close to meeting our climate goals,\u201d Hafstead said.\n\nMany experts called for a higher carbon price. Gernot Wagner, who studies climate policy at New York University, told the Post that the prices should start high and be reduced as experts continue to study the effect of climate change.\n\nRecent results show the world may lose nearly all coral reefs even if warming holds to just under 2 degrees Celsius, the Post reported.", "description": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has found in a\u00a0new report\u00a0that making burning fossil fuels", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/climeate_strike_dc_092019getty_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
