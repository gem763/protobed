John Kasich, Republican of Ohio. Then, one of them turned to chief operating officer and known liberal Wade Black. \u201cWade, do you feel the Bern?\u201d the investor teased him. \u201cAre you a Bernie supporter?\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Black. \u201cI am.\u201d The startling admission drew snickers.\n\n\u201cThey said \u2018Oh, he\u2019s going to bankrupt the country.\u2019 I said, \u2018Do you actually know what you\u2019re talking about?\u2019\u201d recounts Black. \u201cThey probably never met anybody who was a Sanders fan.\u201d\n\nEven by the standards of high finance, Black, 41, can claim membership in an ultra-exclusive club. He belongs to a small minority defying stereotypes and shattering taboos across New York City\u2019s finer eateries and trading pits this primary season: Wall Street financiers who support the presidential bid of Vermont\u2019s self-described \u201csocialist\u201d senator, Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody in this industry who supports Bernie,\u201d one financier who gave to Sanders writes in an email. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of anyone else who might also be a Bernie supporter,\u201d writes another, a former financial analyst at Goldman Sachs. \u201cBest I can tell, I am the only one,\u201d writes a third, while confessing to being hung over from a night out with clients.\n\nBut a dive into Sanders\u2019 donor rolls from the second and third quarters reveals that of the tens of thousands of Americans listed as contributors on Sanders\u2019 campaign finance reports, well over a hundred work in the financial services sector. Most are west of the Mississippi at small firms and local bank branches, where Sanders\u2019 calls to rein in Wall Street do not hit so close to home. More noteworthy are the lonely few\u2014roughly two dozen\u2014who work in high finance in Manhattan.\n\nSure they\u2019re capitalists, but they\u2019re also iconoclasts\u2014Wade Black\u2019s Twitter feed includes several retweets of the dissident journalist Glenn Greenwald and the contrarian finance blog Zerohedge. They do not worship at the altar of the market, and having seen the American economic system from the inside, they\u2019ve come to agree with Sanders\u2019 conclusion that the game is rigged in favor of the well connected and a handful of big banks. Some also work at small Wall Street shops that could actually benefit if Sanders succeeded in his No. 1 goal: breaking up the biggest banks.\n\nAnd what they lack in numbers, these pro-Bernie Wall Streeters make up for in chutzpah: There\u2019s a former world champion player of the fantasy trading-card game \u201cMagic: The Gathering,\u201d a guy named Paul Ryan and the man who oversaw legal, compliance and auditing for Lehman Brothers until its September 2008 collapse.\n\nTo the rest of the street, these people can be hard to fathom. Sure, Sanders praises entrepreneurship on the stump\u2014local business thrived during his tenure as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in the 1980s. And sure, there are plenty of Democrats on Wall Street. But few would call themselves \u201cdemocratic socialists\u201d as Sanders does, and that bronze bull in Bowling Green is not a tribute to universal health care. Sanders has called for breaking up the big banks, imposing higher taxes on the wealthy and waging \u201ca moral and political war on the billionaires and corporate leaders on Wall Street.\u201d\n\nWhich is why Fox Business Network senior correspondent Charles Gasparino\u2014who took to the airways three weeks ago to express shock at his discovery that two brokers in Washington state listed as employees of Merrill Lynch had given Sanders a total of $3,700\u2014tells Politico Magazine he wants to know: \u201cWhen you gave that contribution, did you have a heroin needle sticking out of your arm?\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton has turned up her anti-Wall Street rhetoric as Sanders has gained ground, but her husband\u2019s administration deregulated the industry in the \u201990s, and she maintained good relations with it as a senator from New York. Today, she carries the seal of approval of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. The top 20 contributing organizations to Clinton include Morgan Stanley (whose employees have given $133,000), JPMorgan Chase ($97,000) and Bank of America ($90,000). Meanwhile, no bank broke into Sanders\u2019 top 20, which would require less than $7,700. Not a single soul currently employed by Goldman Sachs chipped in for Sanders\u2014an impressive feat of restraint given that at least three current or former employees of the Koch brothers appear on his donor rolls.\n\nBut among the bankers for Bernie there is Steven Berkenfeld, whose role at Lehman landed him on the list of dramatis personae laid out at the beginning of New York Times journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin\u2019s account of the financial crisis, Too Big to Fail. Since overseeing compliance for Lehman Brothers and serving as chief investment officer of its private equity division up until the firm\u2019s collapse, Berkenfeld, a renewable energy banker who sits on the board of directors of the Sierra Club Foundation, has landed at Barclays. It is unclear whether his environmentalism, his experience at Lehman or something else motivated his contribution to Sanders. He did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSome of the financiers who support Bernie Sanders, like Enrique Diaz-Alvarez, the former head of proprietary trading at the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9e G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, very publicly break the Wall Street mold. Diaz-Alvarez, now the New York-based chief risk officer of Ebury, a firm that helps businesses hedge their currency exposure, has racked up bylines in the socialist Jacobin magazine. His Twitter profile includes a quote from \u201cThe Way We Live Now,\u201d an 1875 satire of greed in English society.\n\nOthers let their socialist tendencies emerge more slowly. At 50 years old with close-cropped dark hair, former Harvard rugby player Paul Ryan certainly looks like a lot of other investment bankers.\n\nEven Ryan\u2019s name evokes limited government and the profit motive. Last week, he received an errant email from his old acquaintance Ken Mehlman, the former Republican National Committee chairman-turned-Wall Street lawyer. Mehlman, who didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, had apparently intended it for the Republican congressman on the cusp of becoming the speaker of the House of Representatives. The actual recipient thought about responding, \u201cYou\u2019re talking to that other rat bastard Paul Ryan who stole my name,\u201d but settled on a more courteous reply.\n\nAnd when it comes to, say, the current Republican front-runner, Ryan, the managing partner of Hayfield Capital, certainly talks like other investment bankers: \u201cTrump is an old, well-known shithead in the business,\u201d says Ryan, adding that when he worked at Barclays\u2019 real estate group 25 years ago, his boss refused to deal with the developer on account of his \u201cslippery business practices.\u201d (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.) Ryan adds, with a hint of admiration, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to give a fuck.\u201d\n\nBut then Ryan starts to talk politics, and the words between the four-letter ones start to sound different. \u201cAnyone with any sophisticated understanding of what\u2019s going on takes that Republican free market bullshit and just calls it out,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody even knows what the fuck a socialist is anymore.\u201d\n\nRyan grew up in Buffalo, New York, and as an undergraduate at Harvard and banker at Barclays in the 1980s, he was sympathetic to Reagan\u2019s pro-market message that government had grown too big. In 1992, he voted for George H.W. Bush because Bill Clinton \u201cdidn\u2019t understand the economy.\u201d", "description": "Inside the \u2018socialist\u2019 senator\u2019s lonely Wall Street fan club.", "authors": ["Ben Schreckinger", "Michael Kruse"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/04/2d/822f12ed42fcafee73494e5ce637/20151007msmsanders830-web.jpg", "published_at": "2015-10-26"}
