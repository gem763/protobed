Josh Hawley at a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, May 23, 2019. (James Lawler Duggan/Reuters)\n\nSenate Republican and big-tech critic Josh Hawley joined forces with Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Richard Blumenthal on Tuesday to introduce legislation designed to increase competition among social media platforms.\n\nTitled \u201cThe Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act,\u201d the bill aims to force platforms to make user data portable, giving consumers the power to transfer their data \u2014 like friends lists and profile information \u2014 across platforms with a simple tool, as well as let third parties update and manage account and privacy settings.\n\nLarge platforms, such as Facebook, YouTube, and others would also have to allow potential competitors access to their user faces, by making key services interoperable.\n\n\u201cYour data is your property. Period. Consumers should have the flexibility to choose new online platforms without artificial barriers to entry,\u201d Hawley said in a statement. \u201cThis bill creates long-overdue requirements that will boost competition and give consumers the power to move their data from one service to another.\u201d", "description": "Senate Republican and big-tech critic Josh Hawley joined forces to introduce legislation designed to increase competition among social media platforms.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
