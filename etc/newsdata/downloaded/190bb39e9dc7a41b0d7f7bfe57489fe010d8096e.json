Trump framed his decision as one that would hand the responsibility of containing IS to the Turks.\n\nAnd late Wednesday, he defended his decision to allow the Turkish offensive by saying the Kurds did not help the U.S. during World War II.\n\nGround fighting since 2014 against the extremist group was spearheaded by Kurdish forces that made up the bulk of the Syrian Democratic Forces, a U.S.-backed organization now tasked with governance of the area and containment of resurgent IS fighters and overcrowded IS prisons. In particular instances, when asked for help in the anti-IS fight, Turkey refused to help the Kurdish forces, which it sees as allies to dissident Kurds in his country.\n\nErdogan has pledged to clear the area of \"terrorists,\" and says his aim is to allow a path for the return of Syrian refugees in Turkey to go back home. Numerous U.S. officials have cast doubt on that promise.\n\nAnkara has long vowed to wipe out the Kurdish militia presence along its border in northern Syria, which it views as a security threat and indistinguishable from a separate Kurdish terrorist group that is waging a counterinsurgency inside Turkey.", "description": "\"We will open the gates and send 3.6 million refugees your way,\" Erdogan says in a speech.", "authors": ["Natasha Turak"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106174545-1570713869917gettyimages-1174964264.jpeg?v=1570713922", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
