It wasn\u2019t. The New York Times reports that National Security Council Ukraine expert Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, who listened in on the call, testified that the \u201ctranscript\u201d was abridged. This explosive report has two important ramifications: First, the call was even worse than the published record lets on, and second, that some officials undertook a cover-up to hide damaging information it contained.\n\nAt the beginning of the month, the Washington Post published a detailed, highly persuasive yet generally-overlooked report summarizing the evidence that the \u201crough transcript\u201d had been abridged. It contains ellipses in several places, which call summaries with foreign leaders usually do not. The word count does not match the reported length of the conversation: It takes about 10 minutes to read the White House-released summary, whereas the conversation took three times that long. It has half the number of words per minute as transcripts of other calls Trump has had with foreign leaders. The supposed rough transcript \u201cis unusual for lacking a tracking number that would normally indicate it had been circulated to senior subject experts and the national security adviser\u2019s office for review and edits,\u201d and \u201ccarries classification markings that Situation Room staffers do not normally add when they create a word-for-word transcript.\u201d\n\nDespite the extensive evidence amassed by the Post, however, there was no proof. Media reports have described the White House-released document as a \u201crough transcript\u201d of the call, a phrase that implies something at least close to a complete record of the conversation. It was not until Vindman\u2019s testimony that Congress had direct firsthand testimony. Vindman testified (under oath, naturally) that he objected to the edits, and pushed for some of the redacted lines to be reinserted, though others were kept out.\n\nThe Times does not have a full account of the expunged conversation. The \u201crough transcript\u201d has three ellipses where Trump is speaking. Vindman testified that the third ellipsis omits Trump asserting there were recordings of Joe Biden discussing corruption in Ukraine. The Times does not know what Trump comments the other two sets of ellipses hide, but reports \u201cthe [missing] phrases do not fundamentally change lawmakers\u2019 understanding of the call,\u201d which is already quite damning.\n\nThe predictable yet staggering revelation might explain why Trump seemed so confident in advance the transcript would exonerate him, and why his allies in the administration consented to its release: Sure, the \u201crough transcript\u201d is bad, but it seems innocent in comparison with the actual call. Having absorbed the full culpability of the conservation, and shaved off some of the worst moments, the parts they released may have seemed relatively defensible.\n\nContrary to Republican spin, the July 25 phone call is merely one small piece of a sweeping array of evidence that Trump corrupted American foreign policy for political gain. Trump has told a series of lies-on-top-of-lies about the call: First, that the \u201crough transcript\u201d constitutes the entirety of the evidence against him, rather than a small piece; Second, that it was verbatim and complete; and Third, that the portion he did release was \u201cperfect\u201d and contains no untoward requests.\n\nVindman\u2019s bombshell opens an important new avenue for the impeachment inquiry. What officials were involved in the cover-up? Will one of them produce an original recording or full transcript?\n\nThe hoary phrase, \u201cit\u2019s the cover-up, not the crime,\u201d does not exactly apply here. The crime is worse. But the cover-up indicates Trump and his co-conspirators knew full well they had evidence of guilt to bury.", "description": "President Trump called the \u201crough transcript\u201d of his Zelensky call a \u201can exact word-for-word transcript of the conversation, taken by very talented stenographers.\u201d Lt.
