(Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhile their on-court success in recent years has exceeded the Lakers\u2019 by almost every measurable metric, the Clippers are still considered by many to be the little-brother franchise in Los Angeles, whether it\u2019s justified or not. To shake off that purple-and-gold shadow that has loomed over them for decades, they\u2019ll need to win an NBA title.\n\nThat finally feels like a realistic notion after what was undoubtedly the best offseason in franchise history. But acquiring both Paul George and Kawhi Leonard was no easy task \u2014 just ask Clippers Coach Doc Rivers, who in a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times revealed details of a meeting this summer in Malibu between him, Leonard and Clippers owner Steve Ballmer.\n\nIt includes Leonard\u2019s brutally honest admission that the Clippers roster, before adding George, simply wouldn\u2019t cut it.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I want to play for you,\u2019 and he pointed at me,\u201d Rivers told the Times. \u201cHe said, \u2018Mr. Ballmer, I love the things you do and what you stand for, but your team is not good enough and if you don\u2019t change your team, I\u2019m not coming.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers soon presented Leonard with a list of players to potentially pair him with, Rivers said \u2014 a bold move considering the team didn\u2019t know if any were realistically obtainable. According to the Times, the only player that piqued Leonard\u2019s interest was George, who had signed a four-year, $137 million extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder last year. Rivers claims he knew Oklahoma City \u201cwanted to break their team up\u201d and initiated a full-court press to obtain the star forward.\n\n[The Dwight Howard-Lakers reunion is a double-sided self-delusion]\n\nRivers told the Times the Thunder initially declined their trade offer, which included a league-record six draft picks in addition to rookie Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari. Lawrence Frank, president of basketball operations for the Clippers, actually texted Rivers on the day of the trade to tell him the deal was off.\n\nFor the head coach, the news stung. But imagining Leonard on the Lakers was simply unfathomable.\n\n\u201cI was at home in Malibu and Lawrence called me and told me, \u2018It looks like he\u2019s either going to Toronto or the Lakers.\u2019 The Lakers part just threw me over. I told him that can\u2019t happen. \u2026 I remember I kept telling him, \u2018We cannot allow that to happen!' \" Rivers recalled to the Times. \u201cI actually told Steve jokingly that if that happens, we\u2019re moving the team to Seattle. It was a joke, but I was actually serious about it. I really believed that.\u201d\n\nGeorge\u2019s July 6 trade to the Clippers sent shock waves throughout the league and delivered a devastating blow to the rival Lakers, who had traded for Anthony Davis two weeks prior with dreams of pairing him, Leonard and LeBron James. It also came as a surprise to fans of the Toronto Raptors, who sought to re-sign their Finals MVP after winning the NBA championship.\n\nThursday\u2019s report comes on the same day ESPN detailed the NBA\u2019s new anti-tampering proposal, which features harsher penalties such as increased fines and the potential revocation of teams\u2019 draft picks. The NBA will also conduct an annual \u201crandom auditing of five teams\u2019 communications with rival front offices and player agents,\u201d according to ESPN.\n\nNBA owners wanted Adam Silver to get tougher on tampering, clean up free agency and level playing field. The commissioner has a plan and a vote\u2019s on tap.
