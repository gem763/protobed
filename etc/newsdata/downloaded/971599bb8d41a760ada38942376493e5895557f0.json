The new rule was implemented as the new Supreme Court term began last week, CNN reported.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts stepped in and said the lawyer speaking could address Sotomayor\u2019s question later, according to CNN.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday in a case that would determine whether the state of Kansas infringed on federal law by prosecuting a migrant under state identity theft statute.\n\nKansas convicted Ramos Garcia for using someone else\u2019s Social Security number in order to get a job in a restaurant.\n\nHowever, Garcia has challenged the case, his attorney arguing that he could not be convicted under state law because it is preempted by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which establishes regulations of unauthorized employment.\n\nGenerally, federal immigration law supersedes state law to ensure consistent ruling across the country. Wednesday\u2019s arguments drew on the limitations placed on states in order to avoid getting in the way of federal law.\n\nThe Kansas Supreme Court ruled in Garcia\u2019s favor, stating that unauthorized employment among undocumented migrants is federal territory. Kansas argues that it was trying to apply its state identity theft law equally to everyone within its own borders, according to CNN.\n\nThe Trump administration has sided with Kansas in the case, with Solicitor General Noel Francisco arguing in court briefs that the lower court opinion \u201cproduced untenable results\u201d by blocking a state from enforcing its own identity theft rule, CNN reported.\n\nThe Trump administration has also argued that the federal and state laws at issue in the case can coexist, maintaining that the state could have continued its prosecution without relying on information from federal forms.", "description": "Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor broke a new rule for justices Wednesday as the court heard arguments in an immigration and employment case.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/justicesotomayor_100818gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
