And July sales were revised higher. The details of the report were strong as well: A measure excluding sales at motor vehicle dealers, gasoline stations, hardware stores and restaurants\u2014the so-called control group economists use to track gross domestic product\u2014rose 0.3% after surging 0.9% in July. Forecasting firm High Frequency Economics estimates that overall consumer spending is on pace to grow at a 3.7% annual rate in the third quarter.\n\nConsidering the drumbeat of upsetting news people were served up in August\u2014with the stock market roiled by escalating trade tensions\u2014the strength of consumer spending in August is somewhat surprising. It is even more so given that measures of consumer confidence from the University of Michigan, BofA Merrill Lynch, and Refinitiv and Ipsos all registered significant declines in August. Count it as a testament to the power of a good job market and easy financial conditions. People might be a bit bummed about the state of the world, but with money jingling in their pockets, it might just make them resort to a little retail therapy. Federal Reserve policy makers are still likely to cut rates when they meet next week, but with fresh evidence that consumers are doing well coming on top of a strong inflation reading earlier this week, they will have some explaining to do. At the same time, investors shouldn\u2019t take consumer strength for granted. While it is easy to discount confidence measures as meaningless, economists have found that they do, in fact, have forecasting value. Moreover, the sour mood appears to have persisted into this month. On Friday, the University of Michigan said the preliminary September reading on its consumer-sentiment index showed only a modest rebound after August\u2019s sharp downturn. The BofA Merrill and Refinitiv/Ipso measures have both registered further declines so far this month. The staying power of the U.S. consumer is remarkable. That doesn\u2019t mean it can hold out forever. Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
