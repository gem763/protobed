Enthusiasm is a significant predictor.\n\nMs. Warren was the first choice of 25 percent \u2014 up from 19 percent last time. Shouting Sen. Bernie Sanders was the only other candidate to break into double digits with 14 percent naming him their first choice, up a stunningly weak single percentage point from his July rating.\n\nDespite \u201cnews analyses\u201d and opinion columns claiming she\u2019s still in the running, Sen. Kamala D. Harris, 54, isn\u2019t clicking with Democratic voters after high visibility in three successive debates.\n\nThe senator and former California attorney general is the only other candidate besides the Biden-Warren-Sanders chart-topping trio who began the long march as a serious nomination possibility.\n\nSo again, Pocahontas remains the one to watch, though neither she, Joe, Bernie nor anyone else on stage in the latest debate may wind up as the nominee.\n\nKeep an eye peeled for some as-yet-unknown savior to enter stage left between now and November \u2014 when the earliest state filing deadlines kick in.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that the Democratic Party\u2019s moderate old bulls and practical politics moguls \u2014 its youngster billionaires tend to be Leninists \u2014 will not somehow find a savior who doesn\u2019t frighten the horses.\n\nWhich is to say someone moderate enough to win a general election and left-wing enough to keep the party\u2019s Warren-Sanders wing aboard.\n\nThe old bull and practical moguls are, however, wrong about who can win the presidency in an America that has already changed its nature \u2014 and not for the better. They are in mortal fear that a Warren or a Sanders or virtually any of the no-border, free-stuff-for-all candidates will do to the party next year what George McGovern did to it in 1972. He lost the whole shebang except for Massachusetts and D.C. to Richard M. Nixon.\n\nThat worry is not necessarily well-founded. A progressive with enough charisma and a convincingly honest-as-the-day-is-long persona probably can win a national election.\n\nSuch a progressive probably might find it hard to beat President Trump. But beat any other Republican? Yes, conceivably.\n\nThe left has so thoroughly taken over public K-through-12 and higher education as to produce an army of young voters who think socialism works and capitalism is as bad as, well, as white privilege.\n\nThat may in some part explain why some 70 percent of Democratic primary voters said they are \u201centhusiastic about or comfortable with\u201d Mrs. Warren.\n\nShe has said she\u2019s not a socialist and is a market-loving capitalist (though on policy and viewpoint, she sounds as far left as Bernie and the other far-outers.)\n\n\u201cI love what markets can do. \u2026 They are what make us rich, they are what create opportunity,\u201d she has said. \u201cBut only fair markets, markets with rules. Markets without rules are about the rich take it all, it\u2019s about the powerful get all of it. And that\u2019s what\u2019s gone wrong in America.\u201d\n\nThat line has a mighty appeal among young and white voters in this country.\n\nWhat about Old Joe? Compared to her 74 percent, only 64 percent said they were \u201centhusiastic about or comfortable with\u201d the man who was President Barrack Obama\u2019s No. 2.\n\nSo, yes, keep this in mind if you can, Mr. Biden: She\u2019s the one who in the end will have your scalp.\n\nAs for you, Ms. Warren, keep this in mind: Scalp does not equal nomination.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
