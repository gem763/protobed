They are willing, they feel no shame in breaking the law.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cThere is a pride that they get out of Fujian and have a chance of a good life with good money in places like Northern Ireland, England, Scotland where there are good benefits.\n\n\"Yes the journey is difficult, it is uncomfortable and it is frightening, but the gamble is normally worth it.\n\n\"The chances of a good life is worth the risk. In this case it didn\u2019t work. Something went wrong but the Snakeheads will just go again.\"\n\nWhile China's economy is booming as many as 30million people still live in abject poverty.\n\nAnd the snakehead gangs take full advantage of those who crave a better life.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHundreds of thousands of people are believed to have been smuggled out of China.\n\nA spokesman for the National Criminal Intelligence Service told The Observer : \"The top snakeheads control the facilitation process from end to end.\n\n\"They have contacts in China, the UK and at every stop along the route.\"\n\nDespite the terrifying conditions the migrants have to face to get to the UK, it is a price many are willing to pay.\n\nThe source close to the gang said: \"These customers get paid as little as \u00a3200 a month in China and live in horrible conditions.\n\n(Image: Humphrey Nemar)\n\n\"In the UK, they can get \u00a32,000 a month in a job with no responsibilities, get benefits, get married and live a decent life.\n\n\u201cThese people who died in this container had hopes of a future in a good country. Another group will be waiting for their chance to get on a lorry now somewhere in Europe.\n\n\u201cThis will not put them off. The plan normally works. The Snakeheads have contacts everywhere.\n\n\"They are \u00adpractical people, not emotional. They have lost \u00a31.2million in \u00adearnings in this. So they will go again.\u201d\n\nBefore this tragedy, the snakeheads gang was also linked to the deaths of 58 Chines people whose bodies were found in an airtight truck at Dover in 2000.\n\n(Image: Skty News)\n\nSister Ping's gang was believed to the thugs behind the tragedy.\n\nBorn into poverty in a poor farming village in her native China in 1949, Ping was still a baby when the People's Republic was created.\n\nWhen she was 15, Ping's father went to work in America as a merchant marine crewman, where he remained for 13 years, sending money home to his family in China.\n\nHe was deported after working a series of jobs as a dish washer and when he returned home, he started a people smuggling business, something his daughter would pick up just a few years later.\n\nAfter marrying, Ping moved to Hong King with her husband and had three sons.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nShe worked her way up the social ladder and became a successful businesswoman with her own factory in her native China.\n\nBut this was not enough for the ambitious mother and in 1981 she got a job as a nanny in New York.\n\nShe and her husband opened a shop which sold goods for homesick Chinese immigrants.\n\nBy the early 80s Ping realised there was money to be made smuggling people from their impoverished lives in China to wealthy America.\n\nInitially running her people smuggling firm as a one woman operation, she charged upwards of \u00a327,000 to transport people from China to the US.\n\n(Image: Humphrey Nemar)\n\nUsing commercial airlines and forged travel documents, the scheme was a huge success.\n\nAnd business really boomed after the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.\n\nHowever, Ping's horrific trading had caught the attention of the authorities and she was jailed for six months in that year following a police sting at Tornoto Airport.\n\nHer time in prison, where she was isolated from other inmates as she spoke little English, seemed to fuel her ambition and after her release she stepped up her vile trade.\n\nPing now had scores of people working for her around the world who would move her human cargo and then hold them hostage until her huge fees were paid and they could be released.\n\n(Image: New York Times / Redux / eyevine)\n\nEven if they managed to arrive safely in the US, more horror awaited the terrified migrants.\n\nPing, at barely 5ft tall, had paid for thugs for hire from the Fuk Ching, which was know as Chinatown's most brutal gang.\n\nHer reputation for brutality and the scale of her operation was immense, she was the world's most norotious snakehead as was known as the 'mother' of the organisation.\n\nBy 1997, using violence and threats, Ping had virtually no competition when it came to people smuggling.\n\nShe continued her vile business in Rotterdam, where her boyfriend was the feared head of the Triad gang in the city.\n\n(Image: New York Times / Redux / eyevine)\n\nIt meant she had access to the most vicious thugs imaginable, who would torture those who stood in her way.\n\nShe also treated rivals with utter brutality.\n\nWhen a fellow gang leader tried to muscle into her territory, she invited him to dinner before having him beaten with a hammer and shot in both legs.\n\nBy now, Ping's operation was vast.\n\nShe had a fleet of eight cars, seven safe houses and dozens of people on her payroll.\n\nVideo

fortune believed to be as high as \u00a340million.\n\nBut the net was closing in on what has been described by the US Justice Department as \"one of the first and ultimately, most successful, alien smugglers of all time\".\n\nFor five years the FBI were on her trail but as she was believed to now be living in China, which has no extradition treaty with the US, could not be arrested.\n\nFinally Interpol had the breakthrough they were waiting for in 2000.\n\nAfter constantly searching plane pasenger lists travelling between Hong Kong and New York, the came across Ping's son's name.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nOfficers were waiting at Hong Kong airport and took her into custody.\n\nPing fought extradition for three years but was finally sent to the US and put on trial in 2005.\n\nShe faced charges of conspiring to commit alien smuggling, hostage taking, money laundering and trafficking in ransom proceeds.\n\nPing was sentenced to 35 years in prison.\n\nTen years after she was first locked up, Ping said in an interview: \"Being locked up for over 10 years allowed me to think about my previous life, my heart calmed down and I started to feel that jail was the safest place for me.\n\n\"I keep telling myself not to think much about the future and live life by the moment.\"\n\nIn 2013 she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and her health was suffering during her time in prison.\n\nPing had high cholesterol and had lost more than a stone since she was first arrested.\n\nAged 65 she died on April 24, 2014, surrounded by her family at the Federal Medical Centre in Texas.\n\nBut her ruthless snakehead legacy lives on.", "description": "Chinese people smuggling gangs are thought to be behind the tragic deaths of 39 migrants found in a lorry at Waterglade Industrial Park in Essex",
