(Stacy Revere/Getty)\n\nIn a game the Lions appeared to have in hand following a fourth-quarter sack of Aaron Rodgers that came with about 10 minutes left and Detroit comfortably ahead 22-13, a pair of questionable penalty calls helped the Packers rally back and escape with a win.\n\nThe first penalty came on that sack when Trey Flowers was flagged for illegal hands-to-the-face on a third-and-10 play that should have resulted in a Green Bay punt. Instead, the penalty nullified the sack, gave Green Bay an automatic first down and led to Aaron Rodgers hitting Allen Lazard for a 35-yard touchdown that cut the Lions\u2019 lead to 22-20 three plays later.\n\nThe second was another call on Flowers for allegedly making illegal contact with tackle David Bhaktiari\u2019s neck or face. This one gave Green Bay a first down and allowed them to run the clock down before kicking a go-ahead field goal instead of kicking it earlier and leaving the Lions with enough time for a final possession.\n\nFlowers, who won the Super Bowl last season with Patriots, had never been whistled for hands-to-the-face fouls in his five-year NFL career.\n\nFollowing the second penalty and the clock being run down to two seconds, Mason Crosby kicked the game-winning 23-yarder to give Green Bay the 23-22 win and did his first Lambeau Leap.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think hands to the chest was a penalty,\u201d Flowers said postgame, according to The Detroit Free Press. \u201cI thought hands to the face, but I had him right here in the chest. The second time I changed it to right here (another spot on the chest). That\u2019s part of a move that I do and, yeah. So, nah, I don\u2019t think that was a penalty, but they did, so\u2026\n\nThanks to the loss, the Lions are now 2-2-1 in last place in the NFC North while the Packers improved to 5-1 to lead the ultra-competitive division.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.", "description": "A pair of questionable penalty calls helped the Packers rally back and escape with a one-point win over the Lions on \"Monday Night Football.\"", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1181111901-e1571140234161.jpg?fit=849%2C565", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
