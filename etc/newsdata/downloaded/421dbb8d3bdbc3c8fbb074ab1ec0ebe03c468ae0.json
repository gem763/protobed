I find it rude and lazy.\n\n(Image: Troels Graugaard/getty images)\n\n\"What people do at home is their own business, but I'm sick of hubby's friends coming over and leaving the seat up. Any tips on how to tackle it appreciated. Rant over!\"\n\nHer post divided fellow users and sparked a debate about toilet seat etiquette.\n\nMany people thought she was overreacting and one even told her to \"chill out\".\n\n\"You could chill out,\" they suggested. \"How come seat-down is the default anyway?\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAnother said: \"Leave it as I found it if I\u2019m using the toilet. If men have to put the seat down, women should have to put the seat up. Fair on everyone then.\"\n\nA third commented: \"I\u2019m a mum of three boys and then my partner I\u2019m the only female able to use the toilet I just have it up unless I\u2019m using it saves kids peeing over the seat.\n\n\n\n\"At least your friends have the decency to lift it in the first place. I wish my only worry was a toilet seat being left up.\"\n\nA different user simply asked: \"Is this a joke? COME ON LADY!!!\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHowever others agreed with the mum and were concerned about the germs that spread when the toilet was flushed with the seat up.\n\nSomeone else proclaimed: \"I always put it down as well as the lid before flushing. Flushing with the lid up means particles of the contents go flying round the room. Anything left out like towels can get bacteria landing on them, yuk.\"\n\nA second thought: \"This would really irritate me as well! It is simple etiquette, not being funny but the seat down is a big enough hole to aim for why do they even need to lift the seat anyway? I will tell you why it\u2019s because they p*** on the seat and can\u2019t be bothered to clean it but for some reason when they lift the seat this automatically gives them the ok to p*** all over the toilet without cleaning it!\"\n\nOthers suggested she buy a sign for her bathroom asking people to put the seat down if she was so bothered by it.", "description": "A mum has sparked debate about toilet seat etiquette after sharing a rant about guests using her bathroom", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Getty", "Troels Graugaard Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13584488.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Toilet-with-seat-up.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
