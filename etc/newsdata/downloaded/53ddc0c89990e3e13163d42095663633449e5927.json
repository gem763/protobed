It wasn\u2019t a good punch. Maybe it was a great punch? He\u2019s fine. So it wasn\u2019t that good of a punch. Unfortunately I have to pull out of my fight with \u201cShogun.\u201d It\u2019s heartbreaking. Hand breaking and heart breaking. It\u2019s a fight I\u2019ve wanted my whole career. He\u2019s just such an incredible athlete, such an incredible fighter. I was excited to share the octagon with him and I\u2019m so sorry \u201cShogun\u201d for you and your team. I don\u2019t mean to do this to you. Whoever they get to replace me I hope you win that fight then you and I can run it back. We\u2019ll make it a great one someday. Good luck on the rest of your camp. I\u2019m going to heal as fast as I can and I\u2019ll be back in that octagon as fast as I can be. Thank you for all your support.\n\nAlvey\u2019s withdrawal from UFC on ESPN+ 22 marks just the second time in his 18-fight UFC tenure that he\u2019s pulled out of a scheduled bout.
