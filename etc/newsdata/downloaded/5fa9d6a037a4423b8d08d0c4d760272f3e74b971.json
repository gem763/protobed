Airspace around all airports is restricted for public safety and security, and we take the flying of a drone within airspace used by passenger planes very seriously. Anyone caught flying a drone without permission must expect to be arrested and prosecuted.\u201d\n\nMr Taylor cited the chaos caused by drone sightings that shut down Gatwick airport before Christmas as an example of the disruption such a protest could cause.\n\n\u201cDrone use in restricted airspace has the capability to not only cause a significant safety risk, but also cause great disruption to the public at the airport being targeted and connecting airports internationally,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe police\u2019s job is to detect and stop criminal activity in a proportionate way, and there is a robust policing plan in place to ensure that we are in a position to deal with any illegal activity as quickly and efficiently as possible.\u201d\n\nHe urged air passengers to travel as normal on Friday, adding: \u201cI would urge people to come on Friday because we\u2019re going to do everything we can to prevent any disruption and I am confident we will be successful in that.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
