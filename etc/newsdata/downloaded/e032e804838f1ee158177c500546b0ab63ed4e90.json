It had 186 million users in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe number, a widely watched metric by investors and advertisers, was above analysts\u2019 average estimate of 206.6 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nSoon after it was launched in 2011, Snap became an instant hit with younger users because of its quirky visual effects that allows them to change their gender in photos or add a dog filter on their face.\n\nSnap Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel said in prepared remarks that the growth in businesses this year put the company \u201con a clear path to Q4 Adjusted EBITDA profitability.\u201d\n\nSpiegel said now that the new Android app has been rolled out, the company is working to create a better user experience in its international markets, helping to contribute to the growth in daily active users.\n\nSnap had rolled out a revised version of its Android app at the end of the first quarter in order to attract users in developing markets, where Android phones are more popular.\n\nSnap was able to attract users recently with its augmented reality filters in addition to launching mobile games within Snapchat by partnering with game developers such as Zynga Inc (ZNGA.O). The company also introduced dynamic advertising last week that automatically creates ads and targets audiences in real-time.\n\nRevenue, which the company generates from selling advertising on the app, jumped about 50% to $446.2 million and beat an average analyst estimate of $435.05 million.\n\nAverage revenue per user jumped 33% to $2.12 during the quarter from a year earlier.\n\nThe company\u2019s net loss narrowed to $227.4 million (\u00a3176.44 million), or 16 cents per share, from $325.1 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding items, Snap posted a loss of 4 cents per share in the quarter. Analysts were expecting a loss of 5 cents.\n\nSnap expects fourth quarter revenue in the range of $540 million to $560 million. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $555.4 million.", "description": "Snap Inc beat analysts' quarterly estimates for revenue on Tuesday as it added more users to its photo messaging app Snapchat, helped by new features such as games within the app.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443859470&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L1VE", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
