Others have confiscated their phones and forced them to delete their social media accounts.\n\nBut even these precautions have not saved several from being snatched up in the largest sweep of arrests in the country since president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took office in 2014.\n\nProtesters, prominent activists, journalists and politicians are among more than 3,000 people who have been detained since small rallies against Sisi, repression, corruption and Egypt\u2019s myriad economic woes, first kicked off on 20 September, according to the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedom (ECRF).\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAlso, according to rights groups and people I\u2019ve interviewed, among those haphazardly rounded up are children who were out buying school uniform, tourists holidaying in Cairo, human rights lawyers going to court to represent clients, confused bystanders, young men popping out for evening strolls, visiting foreign students and street vendors.\n\nAll are now swallowed up in Egypt\u2019s notoriously opaque justice system.\n\nThe protests were triggered in part by revelations of state corruption by former military contractor Mohamed Ali on YouTube but also a multitude of political and economic grievances in Arab world\u2019s most populous country, where a third of its citizens live under the poverty line.\n\nSince they kicked off, Egyptian riot police have patrolled downtown Cairo and other major cities like storm troopers, closing off the country\u2019s well-worn battlegrounds of dissent and the once-graffitied streets that lead onto them.\n\nSecurity forces are instigating stop and searches to look through people\u2019s mobiles. And are apparently even using WiFi hotspots to force people to re-download deleted apps, like Facebook and Twitter, so they can scroll through their feeds.\n\nEgyptian journalists, rights activists, academics, lawyers and opposition figures have been targeted by sophisticated cyberattacks traced to Egyptian government offices, according to a recent investigation this week by Check Point Software Technologies, one of the biggest cybersecurity companies in the world.\n\nMore recently, it appears someone has been hitting the Twitter accounts of well-known Egyptian activists and regime critics.\n\nThe latest victim was Ahdaf Soueif, a celebrated Egyptian author, political and cultural commentator and former British Museum trustee, whose Twitter account was temporarily suspended on Sunday morning.\n\nHer nephew Alaa Abdel-Fattah, a prominent rights activist who was one of the faces of the 2011 revolution, was recently re-arrested along with the human rights lawyer sent to defend him.\n\nAlaa, who has been arrested under every Egyptian regime in his lifetime, had only recently completed a five-year prison sentence on trumped up charges of protesting without a permit.\n\nThe ECRF, which is manning depressingly long spreadsheet count, said like Alaa, more than three-quarters of the 3,000 arrested, have appeared in front of a prosecutor.\n\nThey could only confirm 57 have been released without charge.\n\n100 people are still missing. Testimonies of alleged torture have started flooding in.\n\nAnd yet, no major western ally of Egypt has breathed a word.\n\nIn fact, the UK has done the exact opposite.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Indonesia is celebrating its 74th anniversary of independence from the Dutch colonial rule AP\n\nJust five days after Sisi launched his massive crackdown, Boris Johnson heaped praise on the Egyptian president at a bilateral meeting in New York and failed to mention the protests, the arrests or the crackdown.\n\nFive days before the rallies erupted, the UK's Middle East minister arrived in Egypt to discuss \u201cthe ever-growing economic partnership\u201d.\n\nBritain is Egypt\u2019s single largest investor.\n\nAs sir Geoffrey Adams, the British ambassador to Egypt, put it, the UK is one of \u201cEgypt\u2019s leading partners across a number of sectors including trade\u201d.\n\nLondon knows it can wield power to pressure the regime to behave itself.\n\nBut time and time again \u2013 at least publicly \u2013 it chooses not to.\n\nWe prefer to turn a blind eye to the behaviour of president Sisi\u2019s administration, fearful that without \u201cmoderate\u201d Egypt on board, one of the world\u2019s most unstable regions will somehow disintegrate.\n\nBut how stabilising is it to back a former military-chief who in 2013, before becoming president, presided over what rights groups have called the single largest massacre of unarmed protesters in modern history? Who has banned protests, the websites of hundreds of news and rights groups and several civil society organisations. Who has overseen the arrest tens of thousands of people in the past, and who has instigated this current crackdown.\n\nThis behaviour is clearly not going to change. And the pressure put on Egypt\u2019s 100 million-strong population will only bubble through the cracks in flare-ups like we just saw.\n\n\u201cThere is a misconception that Sisi is a partner in stability which allows governments, particularly in Europe, to turn a blind eye to his behaviour: as long he keeps buying weapons and submarines and power stations,\u201c Omar Robert Hamilton, a British-Egyptian filmmaker and author whose mother is Ahdaf and whose cousin is Alaa.\n\nHamilton said before his cousin was rearrested, Alaa was fighting to put \u201chis life back together again\u201d and to rebuild a relationship with his son, who was born while he was in jail in 2011.\n\nThe arrest of Alaa\u2019s lawyer, Mohamed Baqer, as he showed up to represent the activist, Hamilton believes, is \u201cunprecedented\u201c.\n\nAnd so Hamilton said it was concerning that for Egypt\u2019s western allies, like the UK, \u201ceven empty gestures of condemnation seem to have become a thing of the past\u201d.\n\nPresident Donald Trump earlier in September, infamously asked \u201cwhere\u2019s my favourite dictator?\u201d as he waited for a meeting with Sisi before saying \u201cI just want to let everyone know, in case there is any doubt, we are very much behind president Al-Sisi\u2026 we agree on so many things.\u201d\n\nHamilton added: \u201cPartnering with dictatorships while using the language of rights and legality at home only fuels the forces of reaction and suspicion that are collapsing Euro-American democracies from within. Straight-talking Trump who back-slappingly calls Sisi his \u2018favourite dictator\u2019 is all the proof we need.\u201d\n\n\u201cSisi killed 1,000 people in one day and he is allied with every powerful regime in the world.\u2019\n\n\u201cEgypt is not a national problem but a regional one,\u201d he added.\n\nFor now, the Egyptian government\u2019s strategy has worked, the rallies have been quashed.\n\nPresident Sisi has made some economic concessions like reinstating subsidies on food stables for nearly 2 million Egyptians who lost their subsidies for having salaries deemed too high.\n\nSisi wrote on his Facebook page that he will \u201cpersonally follow up on these procedures\u201d and that government is committed to \u201cprotecting the rights of humble citizens\u201d.\n\nBut critics have called these measures cosmetic. And thousands remain behind bars.", "description": "Some parents in Egypt started banning their children from leaving the house on Fridays fearing, even if they don\u2019t join anti-government rallies, they could risk of arrest.
