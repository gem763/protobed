It\u2019ll come out every week through Labor Day and offer ideas on things to do in the city each weekend. Another, Offsides, starting around June 9, will be a biweekly newsletter that delivers arguments and opinions on the social, political and economic issues around the World Cup. Two other recent temporary newsletters are Internetting with Amanda Hess, on offbeat internet culture; and Caliphate, which is an extension of the Times\u2019 new podcast series by the same name.\n\nThe Times decided to do more pop-up newsletters after seeing its \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d newsletter take off last year. Some 80,000 people subscribed to the eight-time newsletter, and the email had a 60 percent unique open rate.\n\nThese short-run newsletters are a small part of the 55 Times newsletters that as of May 2017 reached 13 million subscribers. (The Times said the subscriber count has grown since then, but wouldn\u2019t provide an updated figure.) But the Times sees pop-up newsletters as a good way to introduce people to the publication\u2019s breadth of coverage and help the Times reach specific audiences. Summer in the City was created with young people in mind, an audience the Times wants more of, for example.\n\n\u201cWe really want to make sure we become a habit for readers,\u201d said Elisabeth Goodridge, the Times\u2019 editorial director of email and messaging. She wouldn\u2019t break out figures for short-run newsletters specifically, but the Times has said newsletter subscribers are twice as likely as regular Times readers to become subscribers. In the case of the pop-up newsletters, the Times actively markets other newsletters to their subscribers. People who sign up for the World Cup newsletter will be prompted to sign up for Opinion Today or sports newsletters, for example.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about building the brand,\u201d Goodridge said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve noticed open rates and KPIs are extra powerful, so it\u2019s also about building up the relationship. People like signing up for them because it\u2019s a short-term commitment, and it\u2019s something they\u2019re passionate about right now.\u201d\n\nWith these recent pop-up newsletters, Goodridge leaned on lessons from the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d one: A limited run makes them appealing; they tap into a subject people are fervent about; they\u2019re written by experts and give people something they can\u2019t find elsewhere.\n\nSummer in the City, for example, will be written by two young staffers and have a distinct format. (Each newsletter will have two neighborhood itineraries, one tailored for a date night or an outing with friends, and the other to entertain parents and other out-of-town guests.)\n\nDigiday Publishing Summit Vail, CO Buy Passes An exclusive, inside look at what\u2019s actually happening in the video industry, including original reporting, analysis of important stories and interviews with interesting executives and other newsmakers. Sign Up\n\nOffsides is catering to soccer fans, but will focus on off-field action. \u201cIt\u2019s niche and aimed at fans of the sport, but will resonate with people who are interested in the opinion section,\u201d said Alexandra March, newsletter editor for opinion, a new role at the Times.\n\nAt 55 newsletters, the Times might seem to be at peak newsletter. But Goodridge, who oversees a staff of more than 15 and growing, said she hasn\u2019t seen evidence that the newsletters are cannibalizing existing ones. She\u2019s also considering newsletters that are for subscribers only, something The Washington Post has done.\n\n\u201cI feel like we could still launch more,\u201d she said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lucia Moses", "Max Willens", "Kayleigh Barber", "Deanna Ting"], "top_image": "https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GOT.jpg", "published_at": "2018-05-22"}
