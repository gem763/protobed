(AP Photo/Cavit Ozgul)\n\nCEYLANPINAR, Turkey (AP) \u2014 Russia moved to fill the void left by the United States in northern Syria on Tuesday, deploying troops to keep apart advancing Syrian government and Turkish forces. At the same time, tensions grew within NATO as Turkey defied growing condemnation of its invasion from its Western allies.\n\nNow in its seventh day, Turkey's offensive against the Kurds has upended alliances and is re-drawing the map of northern Syria for yet another time in the 8-year-old war.\n\nRussia moved quickly to further entrench its role as a power broker after President Donald Trump ordered the pullout of American forces in northeastern Syria. The American move effectively abandoned the Kurdish fighters who were allied with the U.S. and cleared the way for Turkey's invasion aimed at crushing them.\n\nDesperate for a new protector, the Kurdish administration struck a deal with the Russia-backed government of Syrian President Bashar Assad, whose forces on Sunday began moving into Kurdish-administered areas to shield them against Turkey.\n\nVideo by Russian journalists traveling with the troops showed what appeared to be an abandoned outpost where U.S. forces had been stationed in Manbij, a flashpoint town west of the Euphrates River that Turkey has long wanted to wrest from the Kurds. Syrian troops waved flags in the streets.\n\nA U.S. military spokesman, Col. Myles B. Caggins, confirmed American soldiers had pulled out of Manbij. U.S. troops have had outposts there since 2017, when they went in to avert a looming battle between Turkish and Kurdish fighters over the town.\n\nNow Russia was playing that role. Outside Manbij, Russian troops patrolled front lines between Turkish and Syrian army positions to keep them apart, Russia's Defense Ministry said.\n\n\"No one is interested\" in fighting between Syrian government troops and Turkish forces, Moscow's envoy for Syria Alexander Lavrentyev told Russian state news agencies. Russia \"is not going to allow it,\" he said.\n\nKurdish leaders and representatives of the Syrian government held talks at a Russian military base last week, Lavrentyev said, adding that he was unaware of any results.\n\nRussia has been a staunch ally of Assad for decades and entered the Syrian conflict in 2015, providing air cover that eventually turned the tide of the war in his favor. The Russian military has shipped weapons to Damascus, trained thousands of troops and put its advisers in key Syrian military units. Several hundred Russian contractors also have reportedly fought alongside Syrian government troops, but their role in Assad's offensives does not appear to be significant.\n\nIn the first week of the Turkish assault, at least 154 fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have been killed, as well as 128 fighters from Turkish-backed Syrian factions , according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitor of the war. It said at least 69 civilians have been killed in Syria. Turkey says six of its soldiers have died, as well as at least 20 Turkish civilians killed by Kurdish mortar fire across the border.\n\nTwo Turkish soldiers and seven others wounded in a mortar attack from Manbij, according to the Turkish Defense Ministry. The Turkish military retaliated with an assault that \"neutralized\" an estimated 15 Syrian Kurdish fighters, the ministry added.\n\nAn Associated Press team later saw up to 200 Turkish troops along with armored vehicles crossing into Syria by Jarablus, the border town closest to Manbij and Kobani, another Kurdish-held town that is not yet secured by Syrian forces.\n\nFarther east along the border, Kurdish fighters battled to retake Ras al-Ayn, a town captured by Turkish forces days earlier. An AP journalist reported heavy Turkish bombardment of targets in the countryside around it. The Syrian Observatory reported that Syrian Kurdish fighters had retaken the town, but it appeared it was still being contested.\n\nThe move by Russian and Syrian troops alongside the Kurdish forces came as Washington tried to restrain fellow NATO member Turkey.\n\nTrump on Monday announced sanctions aimed at Turkey's economy. The United States called on Turkey to stop the offensive and declare a cease-fire, while European Union countries moved to broaden an arms sale embargo against their easternmost ally.", "description": "Russia moved to fill the void left by the United States in northern Syria, deploying troops Tuesday to keep apart advancing Syrian government and Turkish forces.
