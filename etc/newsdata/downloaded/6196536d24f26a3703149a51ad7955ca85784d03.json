The CNN/New York Times Democratic presidential debate is scheduled to feature 12 leading 2020 hopefuls duking it out from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio -- but the latest batch of alleged undercover recordings could indicate which candidates are preferred by CNN brass.\n\nCNN'S BRIAN STELTER WIDELY RIDICULED AFTER BLAMING TECH ISSUES FOR BIZARRE ANTI-TRUMP SEGMENT\n\nFox News has not independently verified what Project Veritas says is a clandestine recording of CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker and members of his staff discussing their thoughts on the 2020 presidential race. The network has \u201calready picked its winners and losers,\u201d the Project Veritas narrator says.\n\n\u201cIt's incredible that CNN is holding the debate when it's not a neutral referee, it's an advocate for the most-radical leftist policies. The Project Veritas videos are showing CNN for what it has become, the TV headquarters of The Resistance,\u201d Media Research Center Vice President Dan Gainor told Fox News.\n\nCNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCNN HAS BAD WEEK AMID APRIL RYAN, CHRIS CUOMO AND DON LEMON NEWS: \u2018IT WAS QUITE EMBARRASSING\u2019\n\nCNN\u2019s previous Democratic debate, a two-night summer marathon, was criticized by both sides of the aisle. Viewers complained that CNN\u2019s format did not allow articulate answers because of time restrictions and that questions were specifically designed to create tension between candidates. \u201cIt was not CNN\u2019s finest hour,\u201d Poynter\u2019s Tom Jones wrote.\n\nCNN hosts Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper are set to moderate the follow-up event on Tuesday, along with New York Times editor Marc Lacey. But the debate comes amid another public relations headache for the network.\n\nA person identified as CNN\u2019s senior justice correspondent, Evan Perez, is claimed to be featured on a recording saying \u201cJoe Biden has a problem, because his son was trading in his name.\u201d Another CNN staffer is claimed to be heard saying the network is less fair to candidates Andrew Yang and Amy Klobuchar than other 2020 hopefuls.\n\nCNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER\n\n\u201cI think they like Warren a lot,\u201d a person identified as CNN Media Coordinator Christian Sierra says in the video. \u201cThey\u2019re pro-Warren for now.\u201d\n\nSierra is also claimed to have said, \u201cThey don\u2019t like Tulsi Gabbard\u201d and detailed Cooper\u2019s disdain for Trump. \u201cEvery day, he\u2019s always like mocking him and stuff.\u201d\n\nPROJECT VERITAS\u2019 ALLEGED CNN WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS NETWORK IS \u2018PUMPING OUT PROPAGANDA'\n\nThe Project Veritas videos feature now-former CNN satellite uplink technician Cary Poarch (he was fired after the first batch of recordings were released), who secretly recorded some of the network\u2019s morning editorial meetings. Poarch said he still considers himself a Democrat but, \u201cspent many sleepless night\u201d pondering the bias within CNN and hope to ensure a \u201cfree and fair\u201d election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very obvious. It's an unwritten rule that if you are center, center right, or heaven forbid, full-right Republican Trump supporter, then you are not welcome at CNN,\u201d Poarch said in the second installment of videos.\n\nZucker is also heard pushing coverage of Kamala Harris\u2019 demand for Twitter to suspend President Trump\u2019s account despite admitting it wasn\u2019t actually going to happen.\n\nTRUMP SAYS AMERICA WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT 'CNNs OF THE WORLD' AFTER FIERY NEWS CONFERENCE\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not gonna happen, but it\u2019s a good segment in the show, \u2018Should Trump\u2019s Twitter account be suspended?,\u2019 It\u2019s obviously what Kamala Harris has\u2026 others are talking about it. Not gonna happen, but it\u2019s a good talk, it\u2019s a good segment,\u201d Zucker said.\n\nMonday\u2019s initial release featured recordings made by Poarch capturing Zucker telling top news executives to focus solely on impeachment even at the expense of other important news.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about the MSNBC event, OK? I don\u2019t care about them. Let\u2019s just stay very focused on impeachment,\u201d a person identified as Zucker says in the recording on the day of an MSNBC town hall event. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t just pretend, oh, this is going one way. And so all of these moves are toward impeachment.\u201d\n\nPoarch said he decided to wear a hidden camera because of CNN's perceived bias, and said he secretly recorded Zucker\u2019s 9 a.m. rundown conference call because the network was \u201cpumping out propaganda.\u201d\n\nMAINSTREAM MEDIA SHREDS CNN DEMOCRATIC DEBATE: \u2018THE CLEAR INTENT WAS TO SPARK FIGHTS\u2019\n\n\u201cI noticed after\u2026 that there was a strong group-think that permeated through the halls and that everyone was onboard the \u2018I hate Trump Train,\u201d Poarch said.\n\nPoarch said on \u201cHannity\u201d during an exclusive interview on Monday night that he no longer works for CNN as a result of the secret recording.\n\nZucker, who began his career at NBC, rose from researcher all the way to president and CEO of NBC Universal. Along the way, he was responsible for increasing Donald Trump\u2019s fame when he greenlighted \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\n\nZucker and the president famously have feuded since Trump\u2019s foray into politics, with the president attacking the liberal network on a regular basis and accusing CNN of unfair coverage. CNN has filled its primetime lineup with anti-Trump opinion hosts and the network\u2019s White House correspondent, Jim Acosta, has made a name for himself by quarreling with members of the administration when they are available to the press.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIts employees have been opposing the president and pushing for his removal so much that it is obvious it's the corporate position of the network,\u201d Gainor said.\n\nProject Veritas, which frames itself as a conservative whistleblower watchdog group, has previously released what it claims to be hidden camera footage of network news producers, federal politicians and members of private political organizations making statements while unaware they were being recorded.", "description": "CNN\u2019s heavily promoted Democratic debate on Tuesday comes as a second batch of undercover recording puts an emphasis on the network\u2019s political bias.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
