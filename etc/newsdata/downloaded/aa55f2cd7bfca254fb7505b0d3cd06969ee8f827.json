The world is now a much safer place,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An aerial view of a site hit by helicopter gunfire near the north-western Syrian village of Barisha, where the US raid took place.

Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, said: \u201cThe death of Baghdadi is an important moment in our fight against terror but the battle against the evil of Daesh [Isis] is not yet over.\u201d\n\nTrump said US forces were engaged with \u201cmassive firepower\u201d as their helicopters arrived at the building where Baghdadi was sheltering with his family and associates.\n\n\u201cThe compound had to be cleared at this time, with people either surrendering or being shot and killed,\u201d he said. \u201cEleven young children were moved out of the house and are uninjured.\n\n\u201cThe only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel, and he had dragged three of his young children with him. They were led to a certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down.\n\n\u201c[Baghdadi] ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. Test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification. It was him.\u201d\n\nThe US president had presaged the news of Baghdadi\u2019s death in characteristic style, inviting speculation by tweeting at 9.23pm on Saturday in Washington DC: \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump in the White House situation room with the national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, far left, and others. Photograph: Shealah Craighead/AP\n\nIraqi officials told the Guardian the hunt for Baghdadi had intensified over the past month since they identified a Syrian man who had moved his family members and wives from Iraq to Syria.\n\nAn Iraqi intelligence official said the wives of Baghdadi\u2019s two brothers, Jumah and Ahmad, along with other family members, were monitored as they moved to the region. The information was passed to the CIA earlier this month, the officials said.\n\nProfile Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? Show Hide Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is thought to have been born in the central Iraqi city of Samarra in 1971. Though a weak student, whose poor eyesight disqualified him from joining the Iraqi military, he rose to command al-Qaeda\u2019s Iraqi division and then broke away to form Islamic State (Isis). In July 2014, shortly after Isis said it had established a caliphate in Iraq and Syria, Baghdadi delivered a sermon from a mosque in the captured Iraqi city of Mosul. Appearing unmasked for the first time, he declared himself to be the caliph: the political and religious leader of the global Muslim community. His declaration was roundly rejected by almost all Islamic religious authorities but his caliphate became a magnet for thousands of foreign fighters and women. The group attempted not just to hold territory but to administer it like a state, establishing a brutal justice system, collecting taxes and doling out public services. Baghdadi had been seen publicly on one other occasion, in an 18-minute video released in April this year. From 2016 he had a $25m bounty on his head. He had been reported to have suffered serious injuries in airstrikes over the years, and there had occasionally been speculation that he had been killed, but he continued to resurface in audio tapes and videos. He killed himself in October 2019, while under attack from US forces.

He also referenced Muath al-Kasasbeh, the Jordanian pilot the terrorist group burned to death.\n\nThe US national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, said the operation to kill the Isis leader had been named after Mueller, a humanitarian worker who was imprisoned by the group, tortured and repeatedly sexually abused by Baghdadi. She died in Isis confinement at the age of 26.\n\nTrump thanked the governments of Russia, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, as well as the Syrian Kurdish forces, for their assistance. US special forces reached the compound onboard eight helicopters that flew through Russian-controlled airspace with Moscow\u2019s permission, he said, while the Kurds provided intelligence.\n\nTrump said Baghdadi was \u201cthe biggest there is\u201d, casting the operation as the US\u2019s greatest counter-terrorism feat, greater even than the killing of the al-Qaida leader, Osama Bin Laden, under his predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cOsama bin Laden was big, but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country.\u201d\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s death is likely to be a significant fillip for Trump, who has faced withering criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike for withdrawing troops from north-eastern Syria, effectively allowing Turkey to move against the US\u2019s Kurdish allies in the region.\n\nTrump\u2019s critics have claimed the Syrian pullout would allow Isis to resurge in Syria and pose a renewed threat to US interests \u2013 arguments that could be blunted by the latest operation, even if the risk from remnants of the militant group remains.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A destroyed house near the village of Barisha in Idlib province, Syria, where the US military operation took place. Photograph: Ghaith Alsayed/AP\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s death is a devastating blow to a terror group that had run rampant across the region for five years from mid-2014, spawning gruesome terrorist attacks across the world, amplifying a mass refugee exodus and sparking a war to contain it that killed thousands of people and displaced millions more.\n\nThroughout, Baghdadi remained the face of Isis: a fearsome, implacable ideologue who eluded the world\u2019s intelligence agencies while continuing to incite a war of civilisations.\n\nThough long speculated to be a possible hideout, Idlib had been thought by many regional officials to be too risky a proposition for Baghdadi, who was more accustomed to the deserts of Iraq, where his organisation had risen.\n\nFor days, US officials had feared Isis would seek to capitalise on the upheaval in Syria. But they also saw a potential opportunity in which Isis leaders might break from more secretive routines to communicate with operatives, potentially creating a chance for the US and its allies to detect them.", "description": "Isis leader \u2018died like a dog\u2019 in special forces raid on his Syrian safe house, says president", "authors": ["Michael Safi", "Martin Chulov"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb5a71611a8ff8af8622d687369eca93dee7b0e1/0_16_2600_1560/master/2600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2340d33e8ca63dcf7f1dd64dbfd87def", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
