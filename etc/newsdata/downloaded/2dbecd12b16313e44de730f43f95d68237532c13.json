REUTERS/Kate Munsch\n\nThe meeting took place a day after WeWork\u2019s largest shareholder, SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), provided a $9.5 billion (\u00a37.37 billion) lifeline and took over the company, including payments to Neumann to give up control.\n\nIn response to a question from one WeWork employee, Claure said Neumann was like any shareholder of the company who deserved the right to sell his shares.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a level of gratefulness that we\u2019re going to have for Adam, because he\u2019s the one who built this business,\u201d Claure said.\n\nNeumann has the right to sell his stake in the company for as much as $970 million, sources previously told Reuters, as part of a tender offer in which SoftBank will buy up to $3 billion in WeWork shares from investors and employees. He currently owns a little over one fifth of WeWork.\n\nSoftBank has also agreed to extend him a $500 million loan to repay a credit line from JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), as well as pay him a $185 million fee for a four-year assignment as a consultant to WeWork, one of the sources said.\n\n\u2018SURREAL TO CRAZY\u2019\n\nWeWork cofounder Miguel McKelvey had kicked off the meeting by introducing Claure to the staff at the company\u2019s New York headquarters and addressed the tumultuous few weeks WeWork had experienced.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve run out of words to describe what\u2019s been going on from surreal to crazy to unbelievable to...bonkers,\u201d McKelvey said.\n\nIn August, WeWork filed for a splashy initial public offering. This week, it was struggling for survival as it has been quickly burning through the cash on its balance sheet.\n\nThe IPO was abandoned in September as investors balked at sky-high valuations - a deal in January had tagged its worth at $47 billion. The rescue by SoftBank now values it at just $8 billion.\n\nInvestors also questioned both whether its business model was sustainable given big losses it was suffering and the way that Neumann was running the company, triggering his resignation as CEO.\n\nClaure, who was previously CEO of U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp (S.N), set an upbeat tone during the hour-long meeting at which he encouraged questions.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to be part of one of the most amazing comebacks in history and to build jointly with you guys,\u201d said Claure, who is also the chief operating officer at SoftBank.\n\nClaure said that the new cash injection meant WeWork was not going to struggle to survive.\n\nHowever, it was going to focus very differently, he said. \u201cMake no mistake, the world has changed. The growth stories don\u2019t sell any more,\u201d he said. Adding that the challenge was to \u201cbuild a company that has an amazing product, that delights our customers, but also makes money.\u201d\n\nAnd that meant deciding which of the markets around the world \u201cmakes sense for us to be in, which market doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said. According to its website, WeWork has 856 office sites in 123 countries that are open or about to open.\n\nClaure said he did not know how many layoffs would take place as WeWork looks to \u201cgo back to basics.\u201d Sources close to the company have mentioned a range of figures for possible layoffs in recent weeks, from as few as 2,000 to as many as 5,000 out of its 12,500 employees.\n\nClaure said that despite the turmoil, WeWork\u2019s landlords were \u201ceager to find different models of working with us.\u201d\n\nWeWork had $18 billion in long-term lease obligations as of the end of June, according to its most recent public financial disclosure. It also had $1.3 billion in net debt.\n\nThe company is closing or selling a number of businesses outside of the main office-sharing operations. It recently announced it would close the WeGrow private school in New York City after the current school year.\n\nWeWork did not respond to requests for comment.", "description": "WeWork's new Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure on Wednesday defended huge payouts to the office-sharing company's founder Adam Neumann and said there is now \"zero risk of the company going bankrupt,\" according to an audio recording of a meeting he held with employees that was reviewed by Reuters.", "authors": ["Sheila", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444285332&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1XZ", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
