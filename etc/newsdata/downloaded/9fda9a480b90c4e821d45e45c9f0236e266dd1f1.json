That is not the only motivating factor for him - those scars are a witness of having survived.\n\n\"We have to acknowledge that we are not very diverse in Formula One and I have certainly learned through Lewis to accept that it is difficult to overcome discrimination from time to time.\"\n\nHamilton has been accused of hypocrisy after he came out in support of environmental causes, revealing he had sold his private plane and introduced a complete ban on plastics in his daily life.\n\n\"Exceptional personalities tend to polarise. He wears his heart on his sleeve, he has opinions and by expressing them you will always run the risk of polarising. That is human nature,\" said Wolff.\n\nHamilton, 34, will secure his sixth world title and third in successive years if he outscores Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas by 14 points on Sunday.", "description": "Formula One's world champion-elect Lewis Hamilton has been scarred for life by racist abuse that he experienced as a young driver.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6048/4889e1a4d71f4c418cd135fb9e25a6ff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
