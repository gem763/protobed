Insurgents attacked the base in February using mortars, but caused no casualties.\n\n\u201cThe security forces stopped this ultimately failed attack due to their alertness and swift response, not allowing the attackers to breach the outer defensive perimeters of the base,\u201d the U.S. embassy said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. military said that U.S. and partner forces had killed 10 militants and destroyed a vehicle after the attack..\n\nSomali state news agency SONNA reported that all the militants who took part in the assault had been killed.\n\n\u201cIn response to this attack and in self-defense, U.S. Africa Command conducted two airstrikes and used small arms fire targeting al Shabaab terrorists,\u201d a U.S. military statement said.\n\nThe military added that no U.S. or partner forces were injured in the al Shabaab attack.\n\nThe attack showed al Shabaab maintains a good intelligence network and can mount complex operations, said Hussein Sheikh-Ali, a former national security adviser and founder of the Mogadishu-based security think-tank the Hiraal Institute.\n\nThe attack hit a part of the base that houses U.S. special forces, who supervise Somali forces on operations, he said.\n\nItalian and Somali security forces are seen near armoured vehicles at the scene of an attack on an Italian military convoy in Mogadishu, Somalia September 30, 2019. REUTERS/Feisal Omar\n\n\u201cIt implies they have a high intelligence and a degree of capability just to get close to that place,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nThe base is also used to mount drone attacks.\n\nMonday\u2019s attacks follow a dip in U.S. airstrikes in Somalia. Africa Command has carried out four in the past two months, compared with 28 in the first three months of 2019.\n\nThe United States has carried out about 43 strikes against al Shabaab so far this year, against a total of 47 in 2018.\n\nLast year the Pentagon said it would withdraw hundreds of troops focused on counterterrorism operations in Africa, as the military increasingly focuses on China and Russia.\n\nThe Pentagon has already cut about 300 troops from the continent but the head of U.S. forces in Africa is undertaking a broad review on whether another 300 troops still need to be cut.\n\nCONVOY HIT\n\nAl Shabaab said its fighters had breached the base perimeter, though police denied that.\n\n\u201cIn the early hours of Monday morning, an elite unit of soldiers from Harakat Al-Shabaab Al Mujahideen\u2019s Martyrdom Brigade launched a daring raid on the U.S. military base,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAfter breaching the perimeters of the heavily fortified base, the mujahideen (holy warriors) stormed the military complex, engaging the crusaders in an intense firefight.\u201d\n\nAl Shabaab is fighting to overthrow the weak, U.N.-backed Somali government and enforce its own strict version of Islamic law in a country riven by civil war since 1991.\n\nIn a separate attack on Monday in Mogadishu, a roadside bomb targeted an Italian military convoy. A Reuters journalist saw a seriously damaged armored vehicle bearing a small Italian flag sticker. The Italians are part of a European Union mission training Somali forces.\n\nThe incidents follow several other major al Shabaab attacks.\n\nItalian security forces are seen near armoured vehicles at the scene of an attack on an Italian military convoy in Mogadishu, Somalia September 30, 2019. REUTERS/Feisal Omar\n\nOn Sept. 22, insurgents attacked a base in El Salini, southwest of Mogadishu, using a suicide car bomb and gunmen.\n\nA week earlier, al Shabaab said it killed 14 Burundian peacekeepers. The African Union said three Burundians were killed.
