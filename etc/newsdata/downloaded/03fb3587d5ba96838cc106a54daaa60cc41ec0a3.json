You don\u2019t need to do whatever\u201d.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutting their feud to bed, Liam added: \u2018And then we had a really long chat, and he\u2019s a really nice kid.\u2019\n\nWe\u2019re glad they worked everything out.\n\nAfter recently revealing there was little hope One Direction \u2013 also made up of Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horan \u2013 were going to get back together, after going on hiatus several years ago, he mentioned who he was close to in the group.\n\nAdmitting he hasn\u2019t spoken to Harry in a while, he said he\u2019s still super tight with Louis.\n\n\u2018I speak to Louis all the time, Louis is great. He\u2019s doing really well,\u2019 he said, following Louis\u2019 devastating loss of his mother and little sister in a few short years.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve always had a good connection in the way that we were both trying to manage the band together.\n\n\u2018And that\u2019s followed into life, and obviously he has been through a hell of a lot.\n\n\u2018So I\u2019ve tried to be there for him as much as possible, and so does he me.\u2019\n\nThe Strip That Down singer recently appeared on The Jonathan Ross Show, and was asked by the host whether Zayn, 26, would ever rejoin the group after quitting in March 2015.\n\nLiam said: \u2018No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll ever happen.\n\n\u2018When he left, it wasn\u2019t on great terms so I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a thing. If he didn\u2019t want to be here, he shouldn\u2019t be here. Which is fine.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u2018Like I say good for him, he\u2019s gone off and is doing his own thing and he\u2019s doing really well so I don\u2019t want to mess with his stuff\u2026 We did a whole stadium tour without him so I feel like it\u2019s fine.\u2019\n\nFollowing Zayn\u2019s departure One Direction went on to release their fifth album, Made In The AM, but went on hiatus in 2016.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
