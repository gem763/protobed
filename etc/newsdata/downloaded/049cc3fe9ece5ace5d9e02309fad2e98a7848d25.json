Instead of facing that reality and demanding change, those left wing suburbanites just ignore it.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Baltimore. The irony of today\u2019s Democrats is that they espouse values claiming to care for minority communities, but in reality the low-income communities they represent are mostly populated by minorities who have had their economic interests betrayed at every turn by the Democratic Party\u2019s dedication to fighting for open border policies.\n\nStudy after study has shown that native-born black men are the group that suffers most from mass, low-skilled immigration. The fact is that black people, particularly black men, on average have less education and fewer specialized skills than native-born Americans as a whole. This isn\u2019t simply a function of something wrong in their community; this is the result of something wrong with the leadership in their communities.\n\nOne study from leading economists at Harvard University, the University of Chicago, and the University of California-San Diego even found that immigration hurt the economic prospects of African American men even more than the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and \u201890s.\n\nConversely, when the strong immigration enforcement measures that President Trump advocates \u2014 and that Democrats continuously seek to obstruct \u2014 are actually implemented, black and Hispanic families in urban poverty are the first to benefit. In 2017, for example, a Chicagoland bakery was forced to stop employing hundreds of illegal alien workers, but it didn\u2019t go out of business. The owners were merely forced to give those jobs to Americans, between 80 and 90 percent of whom were black Americans.\n\nPerhaps the most important fact that gets lost in the liberal rush to yell \u201cracist\u201d is just how new this obsession with open borders is among the elected officials representing America\u2019s inner-cities.\n\nWhen the sanctuary city movement got started more than 30 years ago, it wasn\u2019t in downtown Baltimore or Philadelphia. The impetus did not come from black Democrats or people of color. Rather, it began with liberal white lawyers in rural Oregon filing lawsuits against immigration enforcement and liberal, mostly-white city officials in San Francisco and Berkeley, California and St. Paul, Minnesota passing the first major \u201csanctuary\u201d resolutions.\n\nAs recently as the 1990s, Rep. Barbara Jordan, a civil rights leader and former congresswoman representing inner-city Houston, represented the prevailing liberal view on illegal immigration. Appointed by President Bill Clinton to lead a landmark commission to study the problem of illegal immigration, Jordan\u2019s report was a scathing condemnation of the policies of non-enforcement then coming into vogue with white liberals, leading her to tell The Washington Post in 1994 that \u201cany nation worth its salt must control its borders.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Jordan made a point of highlighting the particular harm that illegal immigration does to the economic well-being of poor and low-skilled Americans.\n\n\u201cThe commission finds no national interest in continuing to import lesser-skilled and unskilled workers to compete in the most vulnerable parts of our labor force,\u201d Jordan explained in 1995. \u201cMany American workers do not have adequate job prospects. We should make their task easier to find employment, not harder.\u201d\n\nThe open borders rhetoric coming from the Democratic Party today fails to represent the economic interests of black Americans. It is a reflection of mostly white, bleeding heart liberal priorities \u2014 bolstered by corporate America\u2019s desire for cheaper labor \u2014 and it has co-opted the voices of black Americans, whose votes the Democratic Party takes for granted.\n\nI was proud to see President Trump call out this sad state of affairs. While some complain about HOW he starts the conversation, he\u2019s the only one forcing the media to talk about these issues. While some may recoil at the tone he takes, it undeniably forces us to confront the issues America has ignored for too long.\n\nI, personally, have had enough. No longer could my wife and I pay enormous state tax bills that we knew weren\u2019t benefiting communities that deserved it. We couldn\u2019t in good faith stay to see our tax dollars fund universal free healthcare for illegal immigrants while homeless veterans rot on the streets, and we couldn\u2019t continue to watch the state education system turn schools into indoctrination centers for the Democratic Party agenda\u2026 So we left.\n\nDespite growing up in California and working in Hollywood, we had enough of it. Like so many in California, New York, Illinois, and other blue states, we moved to a red state. Most citizens in the inner-cities don\u2019t have the luxury of leaving like we did, though.\n\nRelated Articles There is no reason to change the name of John Wayne Airport: Ethan Wayne\n\nHow bill to help college athletes get paid could backfire: Susan Shelley\n\nSo much political absurdity, so little time: Ron Hart\n\nAfter 70 years of tyranny, where does China stand today?\n\nProtect independent\u2019 voters with SB696: Tom Umberg Instead, the only way their communities will improve is by disrupting the status quo. What\u2019s that old saying? \u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result.\u201d If you hit your head against the wall a hundred times it\u2019s going to keep hurting. If those communities keep voting for the Democratic Party, their communities will continue to hurt, too.\n\nIt\u2019s far past time to lift up our inner-cities, reduce the gap in quality education for kids born into those communities, and give those kids genuine opportunities to grow up into shining examples of the American dream. I only wish more in the liberal media took what President Trump said seriously, instead of reflexively adding to the chorus of baseless \u201cracism\u201d accusations that do nothing to improve the lives of inner-city Americans.\n\nIf you live in a city that has been failed by Democrats, I challenge you to ask yourself some simple questions: How long have Democrats controlled my city? What have they done to fix the problems we\u2019re facing? What have they done to help our young people achieve a more prosperous life than their parents? What have they done to reduce violence and homicide?\n\nIf you answer those questions honestly, you\u2019ll come to realize that you really have nothing to lose \u2014 but a lot to gain \u2014 by voting Republican in 2020.\n\nRobby Starbuck is a Cuban-American producer and director.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LDN-Z-COLISEUM-0816-10-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683"}
