I will seek to appeal and give no more interviews at this stage. \u2014 Freddy McConnell (@freddymcconnell) September 25, 2019\n\nRead More", "description": "A transgender man who gave birth with the help of fertility treatment lost his legal fight to be registered as the child's father, rather than its mother, in the UK High Court on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190925152622-freddy-mcconnell-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
