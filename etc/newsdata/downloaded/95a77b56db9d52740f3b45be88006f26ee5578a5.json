He believes gold prices will remain strong.\n\nHe explained that all the central banks have made efforts to bring interest rates down and thus are pumping money into the system. They hope to stimulate demand and provide an impetus to growth.\n\nThis is a response to the expectation of global economic recession. China\u2019s exports fell in August due to a slump in shipments to the U.S.; the future of the UK remains uncertain as its Prime Minister Boris Johnson is determined to push ahead with its Brexit plan; U.S. jobs growth slowed more than expected in August and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned that the trade conflict could take years to resolve.\n\nMobius also advised traders to hold gold especially if the U.S. dollar is weaker.\n\nCentral banks are also buying more gold. Data from the World Gold Council showed that central banks bought 374 metric tons of gold, the largest net increase for the first half of the year since 2000.\n\nThe 2019 Central Bank Gold Reserve survey also showed that 11% of emerging market and developing economy central banks showed intentions of increase their gold reserves over the next 12 months.", "description": "Gold prices rise amid lower interest rates", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA660DP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
