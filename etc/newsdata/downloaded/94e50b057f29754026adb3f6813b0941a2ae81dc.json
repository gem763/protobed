This fast-paced segment lets callers ask Jim about companies they are interested in like Boston Beer (SAM) : \" This one is terrific,\" said Cramer.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of SAM, below, we can see that prices bottomed in January and have trended higher since then with corrections along the way. The correction in September was deeper than the other pullbacks this year and got down near the rising 200-day moving average line. The 50-day moving average line is flat now but prices are trading above it and the longer they trade above it the sooner the slope turns positive.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line weakened in September with the price action but it has since turned to the upside suggesting the buyers are becoming more aggressive. The trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is now crossing the zero line from below for a new outright go long signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of SAM, below, we can see a strong advance over the past three years. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been in a strong uptrend to confirm the price gains and the MACD oscillator is turning back to the upside for another outright go long signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of SAM, below, we can see a potential upside price target of $445 being projected. If this level is reached it will refresh the uptrend and could precipitate further gains in the months ahead.\n\nBottom line strategy: I am not much of a beer drinker, but I would go long SAM on any shallow dip risking below $375 and looking for a rally to the $445 area for starters.", "description": "Let's check out some wicked charts of SAM....SAM", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Wicked Boston Beer Is Set To Rally To New Highs", "Let'S Check Out Some Wicked Charts Of Sam.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/d5208b13-ec27-11e9-848d-51e72b0cfa00.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
