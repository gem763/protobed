So other! So extraordinarily strange!\u201d So said Sue Perkins as she walked across Tokyo\u2019s most crowded zebra crossing in the opening sequence of her travelogue. But shouldn\u2019t this all be more familiar by now?\n\nThe 40 best TV shows coming this autumn Read more\n\nAfter all, BBC One\u2019s Japan With Sue Perkins, which aired last month, was only the latest in a long run of British TV programmes inviting us to boggle at the east Asian country. These shows always feature a shot of the aforementioned Shibuya Crossing, items on AI and sumo wrestling, and a concerned interview with an undersexed young man (sometimes called otaku) and/or an overexcited young woman (something to do with kawaii). Only rarely do they offer fresh insight.\n\nAt least the upcoming Queer Eye: We\u2019re in Japan! on Netflix and BBC Two\u2019s drama Giri/Haji have obeyed the most basic rule of making British TV about Japan: don\u2019t name it after that slightly racist 1980s hit about masturbation. That\u2019s where Channel 5\u2019s Justin Lee Collins: Turning Japanese went wrong. Or rather, it was the first of many wrong turns in which the since-disgraced comic\u2019s 2011 travelogue erred.\n\nTV\u2019s other orientalist missteps are less daft, but more common. The premise of Queer Eye \u2013 five sophisticates makeover a sad-sack \u2013 puts Karamo Brown in danger of doing an accidental \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d when he arrives in Tokyo. That is, updating the colonial yarn of the westerner who is eventually accepted by an alien community and then asserts his inherent superiority by embodying the culture better than the locals. Happily, Queer Eye has addressed that risk by including Kiko Mizuhara, a Japanese-American model and Tokyo resident as its guide.\n\nThe illuminating presence of Mizuhara is, however, unusual. \u201cBritish television programmes have a tendency to represent Japanese people as stereotypically odd or kooky, without explaining the cultural context,\u201d says Professor Perry R Hinton, an expert in intercultural communication.\n\nThis kind of othering reveals a narrow-mindedness. As Shinichi Adachi, the Japanese-British film-maker behind YouTube culinary series The Wagyu Show explains, Japanese culture isn\u2019t particularly strange, just more accepting of humanity\u2019s strangeness. \u201cThey respect people, even if they don\u2019t understand them. People don\u2019t really care if others have weird hobbies.\u201d\n\nAnother big contextual omission is Japanese self-awareness. A regular set-up in Perkins\u2019s show involves her making wry observations while her hosts look on, blank-faced from the edge of the frame, presumably excluded from the joke by the language barrier. She\u2019s not the only one. Similar interactions took place in No Sex Please, We\u2019re Japanese (BBC Two, 2013), Joanna Lumley\u2019s Japan (ITV, 2016), Adam and Joe Go Tokyo (BBC Three, 2003), and even in Jonathan Ross\u2019s generally respectful Japanorama series (BBC Choice/BBC Three, 2002-7).\n\nBut Japan is in on the joke. Indeed, they\u2019re the ones who cracked it in the first place. Hinton gives the gameshow Endurance as an example. First introduced to British audiences via Clive James on Television, then Tarrant on TV (1982-2006), it began a fascination with Japanese gameshows that has continued through Takeshi\u2019s Castle and the controversial E4 spoof Banzai, which Guy Aoki of the Media Action Network for Asian-Americans described as \u201can Asian minstrel show\u201d. Yet all this revelling in gameshow exotica was born out of a subtle mistranslation. Hinton points out that the word \u201cendurance\u201d has a particular connotation in Japanese culture, akin to \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d, with roots in the resilience required for post-second world war reconstruction. \u201cRather than Endurance representing Japanese otherness, it showed a confidence in being able to mock one\u2019s own national character, similar to Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus,\u201d says Hinton. The Japanese gameshow is as much an example of cultural similarity as it is of difference, but it\u2019s the latter that British TV producers choose to emphasise.\n\n\u201cTo attract viewers, it\u2019s understandable,\u201d says Chiho Aikman, of the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation in London, \u201cbut the reality of Japanese culture is quite different.\u201d She suggests architecture, regional cuisine (\u201cWe don\u2019t just eat sushi!\u201d) and the spread of hate speech as topics that don\u2019t get enough attention. Instead, shows about hikikomori (modern-day hermits) and 40-year-old virgins with huge hentai (manga/anime porn) collections give the impression that subcultures typify an entire nation. In truth, such selections often say more about the audience than they do about the subject. So, if anyone comes out of this looking like socially inadequate, culturally insular, sex-obsessed pervs, well, it\u2019s not the Japanese, is it?\n\nQueer Eye: We\u2019re in Japan! is available from Friday 1 November on Netflix", "description": "From travelogues to Banzai, there\u2019s a history of portraying the country as kooky and odd \u2013 saying more about its makers than its subject", "authors": ["Ellen E Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5accaf4dae89afa8bd1fc37c4b9b2a36a54980e6/0_0_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3beb6419f40ac4da38ccd7852c610c44", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
