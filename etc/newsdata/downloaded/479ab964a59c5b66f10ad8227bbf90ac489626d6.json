Entitled the Europa Conference League, its name has prompted a tsunami of amusing \u201cVauxhall\u201d and \u201cVanarama\u201d gags because of the c-word\u2019s low-rent connotations in English football parlance. It will serve as a third-tier Uefa club competition and give more clubs in more countries a chance to participate in Europe.\n\nAt least that was the party line when the tournament was unveiled by Uefa\u2019s president, Aleksander Ceferin, at the organisation\u2019s executive committee meeting in Ljubljana on Tuesday, although cynics might be excused for thinking it is little more than a sop to keep European football\u2019s also-rans happy while ensuring the wealthiest clubs continue to qualify for the Champions League.\n\nMK Dons v Liverpool, Manchester United v Rochdale: Carabao Cup \u2013 live! Read more\n\nConfirmed last December and ratified this week, the Europa Conference League will sit below the Champions League and Europa League in the hierarchy and will comprise 32 teams split into eight groups of four. Group winners will progress to the last 16, and an additional knockout round will be played before the last 16 between the second-placed teams and eight teams who drop from the Europa League. The winners of the Europa Conference League will enter the following season\u2019s Europa League. Matches will be played on Thursday with kick-offs at 5.45pm and 8pm UK time.\n\nIt will be left to national associations to decide the criteria for earning a place, with England, Spain, France, Italy and Germany getting one each. England\u2019s will go to the winners of next season\u2019s Carabao Cup, but if that team end up qualifying for Europe by other means, as Manchester City did last season, the recipients of the Europa Conference League will be determined by league position.\n\nIn a move that could have serious ramifications for Scottish clubs, Uefa has announced that the Europa League group stages are being reduced from 48 teams to 32 from 2021. From that point, only nations ranked 15th or higher in Uefa\u2019s coefficient table will be granted access to the Europa League. The league winners of countries with a lesser ranking will still enter Champions League qualifying but seem likely to go into the Europa Conference League should they fail to make the group stages. It should be stressed that the finer details regarding qualification have yet to be decided.\n\nWolves make poor start to group stage as Braga exploit sloppy defending Read more\n\nThe Scottish Premiership winners currently enter the Champions League qualifying rounds, while the teams that finish second, third and fourth compete in Europa League qualifying. Scotland are 19th in Uefa\u2019s coefficients, meaning all but the champions would automatically go into the new competition and presumably suffer financial consequences. Should Scotland improve their ranking to 15th place or higher, they could have as many as five representatives in Europe: two in Champions League qualifying and three elsewhere.\n\nIn England much has been made of the Premier League travails being endured by Wolves. Despite Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s pre-season assurances that his squad would be well equipped to maintain the league form that earned them qualification for this season\u2019s Europa League, all available evidence suggests escapades on the continent are having a predictably adverse effect on results at home.\n\nIn recent years teams from outside the Premier League\u2019s Big Six have suffered on the domestic front after clambering aboard the Thursday-Sunday Europa League treadmill. Between them, Burnley (14), Everton (12), Southampton (17) and West Ham (17) acquired 60 points fewer in the seasons immediately following European qualification. It does not take a genius to figure out why.\n\nQualifying for Europe\u2019s second-tier competition tends to hamstring any chance such clubs have of kicking on and qualifying for its main one. It is, one suspects, a state of affairs Uefa and those clubs at the top of the Premier League hierarchy find entirely agreeable in their insatiable quest for wealth.\n\nWolves fans should enjoy their foray into Europe but are entitled to view it as the distraction that will end any chance of gatecrashing the Premier League\u2019s top-four party in a season when the places of Tottenham, Manchester United and Chelsea seem under threat. The Europa Conference League will further jeopardise any small chance that ambitious middle-ranking top-flight teams from Europe\u2019s major leagues have of getting into Uefa\u2019s blue-riband event.\n\nAlthough this new competition will ensure more clubs than ever get to muddy their spats in European competition, it seems abundantly clear it will tighten the stranglehold of those rich grandees from the English, Spanish, French, Italian and Spanish leagues who consider their place among the continental elite not so much a privilege as a divine and inalienable right.", "description": "New competition starts in 2021 and could ensure the Champions League remains an ever-more elusive target for those outside the elite", "authors": ["Barry Glendenning"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75f2e9c8f377f57b0eb0bf9d3858ee776fce152e/0_146_3185_1911/master/3185.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=157f726f8281e173705385699a27993f", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
