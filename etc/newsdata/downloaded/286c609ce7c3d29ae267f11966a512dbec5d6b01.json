BA, +1.79% rose 1.2% in premarket trading Wednesday, after the aerospace and defense giant reported third-quarter profit that fell well below expectations while revenue beat, as lower 737 deliveries were partially offset by higher defense and services volume. Net income fell to $1.17 billion, or $2.05 a share, from $2.36 billion, or $4.07 a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share declined to $1.45 from $3.58, missing the FactSet consensus of $2.07. Revenue fell 21% to $19.98 billion, but topped the FactSet consensus of $19.61 billion. Commercial airplane deliveries fell 67% to 62, below the FactSet consensus of 65, while the segment's revenue declined 41% to $8.25 billion to beat expectations of $7.78 billion. Defense, space and security revenue grew 2% to $7.04 billion to beat expectations of $6.76 billion. The company said it assumes regulatory approval of the 737 Max's return to service will begin in the fourth quarter, and that it will gradually increase the 737 production rate to 57 per month from 42 per month by late 2020. The stock has shed 9.7% over the past three months through Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.15% has slipped 2.1%.", "description": "Shares of Boeing Co. rose 1.2% in premarket trading Wednesday, after the aerospace and defense giant reported third-quarter profit that fell well below...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
