Can you give us any insight into that? Because it was quite troubling.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Google bought this AI company called DeepMind,\u201d Vorhies replied. \u201cLet me just put it in plain language what that is, DeepMind was creating a god-like AI system that is able to ingest the available public information on the internet and make sense of it. Think of it like Amazon Alexa except much much much more intelligent. This AI system was moved out of the UK I believe and placed into China, and it\u2019s been dubbed the AI Manhattan Project.\u201d\n\nVorhies continued: \u201cPeter Thiel \u2014 he accused Google of acting in a treasonous way. This is how serious this project is. It\u2019s the most sophisticated and advanced AI project in the world made by an American company and placed in China.\u201d\n\nMansour noted that Google was placing this AI project in a country with numerous human rights violations and asked if this AI was going to be used for surveillance of citizens.\n\nVorhies stated: \u201cWhen people think of surveillance they usually think of country surveillance. This is planetary surveillance of all information that is available on the surface web and also any sources that it can get in the deep web and utilizing Google\u2019s extensive deep analysis of its book scanning stuff. So think of the Library of Alexandria of all available websites that you can search for and all that data gets fused together and a decision-making process gets formed because of that. This is essentially what the Google DeepMind project is all about.\u201d\n\nListen to the full interview here.\n\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM\u2019s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
