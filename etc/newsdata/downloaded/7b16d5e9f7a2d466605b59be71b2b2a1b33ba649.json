While the Amazon-owned company claims it is designed as an educational feature, a number of publishers are demanding that their books be excluded, saying these captions are \u201cunauthorized and brazen infringements of the rights of authors and publishers.\u201d\n\nOn its face, the idea seems useful, much in the same way that I turn on subtitles for things that I\u2019m watching on TV, but publishers have some reason to be concerned: it\u2019s possible that fewer people will buy distinct e-book or physical books if they can simply pick up an Audible audiobook and get the text for free, too.\n\nAnd Audible may not have the right to provide that text, anyhow.\n\nIn the publishing world, authors and their agents sign very specific contracts with publishers for their works: these contracts cover everything from when the manuscript needs to be delivered, how an author is paid, and what rights to the text a publisher might have, such as print or audio. As an audiobook publisher and retailer, Audible gets the rights to produce an audiobook based on a book, or to sell an audiobook that a publisher creates in its store. Publishers say that a feature that displays the text of what\u2019s being read \u2014 itself a reproduction from the original text \u2014 isn\u2019t one of those specific rights that publishers and authors have granted, and they don\u2019t want their books included in Audible\u2019s feature when it rolls out.\n\nBut Audible Captions aren\u2019t quite the same experience as reading an e-book, as you can see here:\n\nAudible tells The Verge that the captions are \u201csmall amounts of machine-generated text are displayed progressively a few lines at a time while audio is playing, and listeners cannot read at their own pace or flip through pages as in a print book or eBook.\u201d Audible wouldn\u2019t say which books would get the feature, only that \u201ctitles that can be transcribed at a sufficiently high confidence rate\u201d will be included. It\u2019s planning to release the feature in early September \u201cto roll out with the 2019 school year.\u201d\n\nPenguin Random House, one of the world\u2019s five biggest publishers, told The Verge that \u201cwe have reached out to Audible to express our strong copyright concerns with their recently announced Captions program, which is not authorized by our business terms,\u201d and that it expects the company to exclude its titles from the captions feature.\n\n\u2018an unauthorized and brazen infringements of the rights of authors and publishers\u2019\n\nOther publishers have followed suit. Simon & Schuster (disclosure: I\u2019m writing a book for one of its imprints, Saga Press), echos their sentiments, calling the feature \u201can unauthorized and brazen infringements of the rights of authors and publishers, and a clear violation of our terms of sale,\u201d and has also told Audible to \u201cnot include in Captions any titles for which Simon & Schuster holds audio or text rights.\u201d A Macmillan spokesperson said that \u201cthe initiative was not authorized by Macmillan, and we are currently looking into it.\u201d\n\nThe Authors Guild also released a statement, saying that \u201cexisting ACX and Audible agreements do not grant Audible the right to create text versions of audio books,\u201d and that the feature \u201cappears to be outright, willful copyright infringement, and it will inevitably lead to fewer ebook sales and lower royalties for authors for both their traditionally published and self-published books.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the feature squares up against the existing audio rights that are granted to it, an Audible spokesperson told The Verge that it does \u201cnot agree with this interpretation,\u201d but declined to comment further on whether or not the company actually has the right to go through with it. Audible refused to comment about whether or not it would honor publishers\u2019 requests, saying only that it was working with publishers to \u201chelp address some confusion about how Audible Captions works and what listeners will experience.\u201d\n\nThe Verge has reached out to other major publishers for comment, including Little, Brown and Company and Hachette, but did not hear back by publication of this post.\n\nDongWon Song, an agent from the Howard Morhaim Literary Agency, tells The Verge that there\u2019s two sets of issues at play, because Audible acts as both a publisher and as a retailer. \u201cIf Audible is producing a book as a sublicense from a publisher,\u201d he says \u201cthen they only have rights to the audio, or they have the right to create and sell an audio recording of the text, and that\u2019s all the rights that they\u2019re given: they\u2019re not given any text rights, they\u2019re not given any electronic rights, they\u2019re just given the right to distribute an audio edition.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a retailer, they have even less rights. As a retailer, they have no right to what\u2019s in the text, so if it\u2019s third party, whether Macmillan makes the audio or Random House or whatever, they make their own audio edition, and as a technology or sales platform, Audible only has the right to sell those things on the platform.\u201d\n\nAudible\u2019s feature is using machine learning to translate those audio recordings into text, and while the company denied that it\u2019s creating ebooks, that translation is \u201cnot a thing that is explicitly granted to them,\u201d Song says. \u201cI hear what they\u2019re saying on one level, but on another level, they are reproducing the full text of the book in print form. Full stop. It\u2019s not an excerpt, it\u2019s not a fair use argument, they\u2019re taking the entire text and reproducing that on your phone or on your device.\u201d\n\n\u2018they are reproducing the full text of the book in print form. Full stop.\u2019\n\nSong notes that while he sees some value in such a feature, \u201cit\u2019s depriving authors of a route for more income and to be paid for their work.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Amazon has come under fire for publishers when it comes to translating text to audio, or vice-versa. In 2009, the company backtracked on a text-to-speech feature on the Kindle, which allowed readers to listen to their book with machine-generated narrator. The Authors Guild argued that the feature deprived authors of their audio rights, and Amazon disabled it.", "description": "Amazon\u2019s Audible has announced that it will roll out a feature called Audible Captions later this fall, which will display machine-generated text while listeners listen to their audiobook. But several publishers say that the feature violates their agreements with the company, and have asked for their books to be excluded from the feature.", "authors": ["Andrew Liptak", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W9pj2-FH9V5dc_gnLd4ukyjoWOM=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18322065/acastro_190719_1777_audible_0002.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-19"}
