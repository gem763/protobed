The House of Representatives has not authorized it.\n\nHearings are being held in secret and transcripts of interviews are not being released. The minority party cannot ask questions, request evidence or subpoena witnesses, and witnesses have no due process.\n\nTrump administration officials cannot have department attorneys with them. And if the Trump administration does not surrender to their demands, they will consider the president guilty of obstruction.\n\nAre they serious?\n\nAn impeachment inquiry, in terms of House precedent, requires a full House vote. For the body to act as one-half of one-third of the government, it must vote. Mrs. Pelosi may be the speaker, but she does not individually speak for the entire House.\n\nConsider their predicament: Democrats want to closely control what information is released. They built a narrative by coordinating with a partisan Democratic whistleblower, fanned the flames with their media allies, and now are seeking witnesses and documents in service of their only real political goal: Removing President Trump from office and overturning the results of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nImpeachment is the most serious constitutional remedy made available to Congress. It has been attempted only three times before in our history. It should be reserved for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d not partisan efforts.\n\nIn the 1990s, more than 20 House Democrats voted in favor of the impeachment inquiry that Republicans sought against President Bill Clinton. The minority\u2019s rights were protected, and the full House weighed in on this constitutional remedy.\n\nThat precedent is not in place today.\n\nFor impeachment to work politically, the party that pushes it needs majority support and bipartisan agreement. There is zero evidence that Mrs. Pelosi has either.\n\nAfter dramatically launching, the impeachment effort has now wasted two valuable weeks.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 goal of resolving impeachment by Thanksgiving is off to a slow start.\n\nWill Democrats give up a little control in favor of due process? Will Mrs. Pelosi allow a floor vote on the impeachment inquiry?\n\nUntil now she has wanted to protect her most vulnerable members.\n\nBut this instinct has robbed her of the weight of an official House action. And without this vote, she likely will lose in court when House Republicans sue over access to witnesses and evidence.\n\nI believe the Democrats are pursuing this quixotic impeachment effort because their Democratic presidential candidates are flailing, the economy is roaring, Mr. Trump has a clear path to reelection, and investigations into the origin of the Russia collusion hoax are being vigorously investigated.\n\nDesperate times call for desperate measures.\n\nMrs. Pelosi is risking her majority over impeachment. She has now committed House Democrats not just to a sham impeachment inquiry, but to a vote on impeachment.\n\nI will predict right now that if an impeachment vote is held, more Democrats will vote against impeachment than Republicans will vote for it.\n\nHouse Democrats are trapped. They have riled up their base while risking their most vulnerable members. Now they must decide which side they will disappoint.\n\nThe president will never be removed from office in the Senate, with at least 20 Republican votes needed. This mathematical reality makes this entire charade pointless.\n\nIt is important to remember that Ukraine\u2019s president said he wasn\u2019t pressured on his July 25 phone call with Mr. Trump and that Ukraine did not know the military aid had been temporarily held back. These are crucial details that obliterate Democrats\u2019 case for impeachment.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are refusing to pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal, address rising prescription drug prices or work on a bipartisan infrastructure plan.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 partisan impeachment effort is losing altitude and now threatens Democrats far more than it does the White House.\n\n\u2022 Matt Mackowiak is president of Austin, Texas, and Washington-based Potomac Strategy Group.
