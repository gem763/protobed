And he\u2019s also never thrown a pick in a regular-season game.\n\nIn one of the more fascinating developments this season, Allen has thrived in place of an injured Cam Newton, as the Carolina Panthers beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at London\u2019s Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 37-26. The Panthers controlled the game from the start but failed to put it away until late.\n\nAllen looked sharp and in command, completing 20 of 32 passes for 227 yards and two TDs. The Dallas Cowboys\u2019 Dak Prescott holds the record for most pass attempts (177) prior to throwing an interception, setting that number in 2016, and the second-year Allen is closing in on that mark with 153 passes without a pick to date.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe same could not be said for the Bucs\u2019 Jameis Winston. He was intercepted five times \u2014 a career high \u2014 and lost one of his two fumbles in another tough performance in what has been an up-and-down pattern in his career. Winston kept fighting and had the Bucs within striking range late, but he threw his fourth pick with 2:23 remaining to seal it. The Bucs totaled seven turnovers on the day.\n\nThe Panthers are 4-2, matching the New Orleans Saints\u2019 win total prior to their game against the Jacksonville Jaguars later in Week 6. The Bucs have now dropped two straight and fell to 2-4.\n\nIs it possible this game signaled a change in the future QB direction of both franchises?\n\nCarolina Panthers QB Kyle Allen has yet to lose an NFL start. (Getty Images)\n\nStory continues\n\nNot long ago, it would have been considered ridiculous to suggest that the undrafted Allen \u2014 not the injured Newton \u2014 might be the future face of the Carolina franchise. But recent health worries, most recently Newton\u2019s foot injury, cloud that picture. Allen\u2019s terrific season raises the questions of what the Panthers might do in the future with Newton, who carries a $21.1 million salary-cap hit in the final year of his deal in 2020.\n\nWinston has some big games this season, and he came into Sunday with only two interceptions in his previous four games. But this was his second game of his season with three or more INTs and the fourth time in his 62-game career that he\u2019s had four or more interceptions in a game. Winston is in the final year of his contract and is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent after this season. Can Bruce Arians turn him around in the final 10 games of the season? Or are the Bucs destined to go a different direction next season?\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t all on Winston. Mike Evans failed to catch three passes, including one brutal drop. The Buccaneers also committed three straight penalties (they had nine in the game) prior to a punt. Execution errors abounded in this ugly game. Still, there has to be a serious debate about whether Winston can become a franchise QB for this team.\n\nWith the win, the Carolina Panthers are back over .500 for the first time since last November. Last year, the Panthers started 6-2 before crashing and finishing at 7-9. Allen started in Week 17 last season and now has strung together some quality performances. He has never thrown an interception in a regular-season game and the Panthers are 5-0 when he starts over the past two seasons.\n\nQuarterback victories is not a statistic with much merit, but the Panthers have lost eight straight with Newton starting. With the way Allen has played, is it possible that the Panthers will stick with the second-year QB over their former MVP? It\u2019s a fascinating debate.\n\nNewton is only 30 years old and might have some fantastic football ahead of him. But head coach Ron Rivera and GM Marty Hurney had to be feeling the heat when the Panthers fell to 0-2 to start the season with a new team owner in Dave Tepper possibly eyeing changes to the power structure. Now that the team is hot, Rivera likely is readying himself for a decision \u2014 Allen or Newton? \u2014 for after the Panthers\u2019 Week 7 bye.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Kyle Allen has led the Panthers to four straight wins.
