The decision affirms that the Supreme Court saw through the Trump administration\u2019s deceitful attempts to weaponize the census for partisan purposes and threaten the accuracy of the decennial count. These efforts were, as the Court said, \u2018contrived.\u2019 Now the Commerce Department must move forward to ensure a fair and accurate count and stop their efforts to add this unnecessary question.\n\n\u201cBut our work doesn\u2019t stop here. The specter of the question has heightened fear and mistrust in communities and discouraged some from participating in the census. All hands are on deck to ensure everyone is counted.\u201d\n\nThe Leadership Conference Education Fund builds public will for federal policies that promote and protect the civil and human rights of all persons in the United States.
