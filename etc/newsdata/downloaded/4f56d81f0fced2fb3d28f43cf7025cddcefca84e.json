The juicy sinker to pitcher Antonio Senzatela will stick with him.\n\n\u201cI got ahead of him and I made a really bad pitch,\u201d Matz said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it boils down to.\u201d\n\nSenzatela hit a tying, two-run single that ended a year-long 0-for-44 slide at the plate, and Story followed three pitches later with a three-run homer to cap a six-run fourth inning. The Colorado Rockies beat the Mets 9-4 Monday night to drop New York five games back for the second NL wild card with 12 games to play.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t really think about that too much,\u201d Matz said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in a hole in the season before, and we\u2019ve got to go and play our best baseball and let the standings take care of themselves.\u201d\n\nBrandon Nimmo, batting leadoff for the first time since May 17, opened the game with a home run off Senzatela (10-10). Starting their last road trip of the regular season, the Mets built a 4-1 lead on Jeff McNeil\u2019s two-run homer in the third that stopped an 0-for-13 slump and Amed Rosario\u2019s RBI double in the fourth.\n\nMatz, who allowed Ian Desmond\u2019s second-inning homer, needed 42 pitches to get through the fourth and dropped to 0-2 with a 10.15 ERA in three starts at Coors Field.\n\nCharlie Blackmon singled with one out, Ryan McMahon walked and Garrett Hampson hit an RBI single with two outs.\n\nNo. 8 hitter Drew Butera walked to bring up Senzatela, who had not gotten a hit since a two-run single off San Francisco\u2019s Dereck Rodriguez on Sept. 16 last year. With the count 1-2, Senzatela lined a sinker into left field.\n\n\u201cJust looking for something to hit, get a base hit,\u201d Senzatela said.\n\nStory followed with a drive into the left-field seats off Matz (10-9), who allowed seven runs, six hits and two walks in four innings.\n\n\u201cA pitch out over the plate and he got a base hit,\u201d Mets manager Mickey Callaway said. \u201cThat kind of opened up the floodgates.\n\nSenzatela gave up four runs and eight hits in six innings.\n\n\u201cI felt really good with the breaking ball today,\u201d he said.\n\nDesmond made a nice leaping catch near the top of the left-field wall against Nimmo in the fifth.\n\nHampson had three hits, including a run-scoring single in the seventh off Paul Sewald, and Nolan Arenado hit an RBI double in the eighth against Edwin D\u00edaz.\n\nMets rookie Pete Alonso ended a career-worst 0-for-21 slump with a fourth-inning single.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMets: RHP Robert Gsellman (right tricep tightness) could return before the end of the regular season, Callaway said. \u2026 Callaway said INF Dominic Smith (right shoulder) is in Florida and will begin baseball activities soon.\n\nRockies: LHP Kyle Freeland (left groin strain) is scheduled to throw a simulated game on Tuesday. Freeland, out since Aug. 21, hopes to return this season.\n\nHOMER HAPPY\n\nColorado has allowed 16 leadoff homers, tying the major league record set by the 2017 Seattle Mariners, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\n\nHITTING THE WALL\n\nMets LF J.D. Davis ran into the wall after snaring Story\u2019s drive in the eighth inning. He lay on the ground and was looked at by a trainer but stayed in the game.\n\nDavis was surprised to see Alonso run over from first base to check on him.\n\nI asked him, \u2018What are you doing out here?\u2019\u201d Davis said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to check out the Sun Bear.\u2019 I said, \u2018You\u2019re ridiculous, go back to first.\u2019 Sun Bear, I guess that\u2019s his new nickname for me.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNew York RHP Marcus Stroman (8-13, 3.35), making his ninth start since joining the Mets on July 28, will face Colorado RHP Tim Melville (2-2, 5.16) Tuesday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Steven Matz doesn't regret the 401-foot home run by Trevor Story.
