So naturally, it was only a matter of time before a politician came in and ruined our fun.\n\nWe\u2019re pretty sure Daniel Andrews is the first politician in Australia to jump on the Tik Tok bandwagon, and hopefully the last because this is the cringiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nHis extensive stream of content includes a video of him walking through parliament to the sound of \u2018500 Miles\u2019 by The Proclaimers, and a -reenactment of the viral cat dancing to \u2018Mr Sandman\u2019 video. Why? I don\u2019t know.\n\nAccording to a spokesman for the Premier, he\u2019s using it as a way to connect with new audiences, which seems a little weird considering that the platform is primarily used by people who aren\u2019t even old enough to vote.\n\n\u201cTik Tok is one of the fastest growing platforms in the world, so it was an easy decision for us to get on there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see it as a way of making the work of government more accessible, and have a bit of fun along the way.\u201d\n\nMelbourne University Digital marketing expert BrentCoker told ABC that the Premier was using Tik Tok to seem more relatable and to build association with him.\n\n\u201cUltimately what they want is the voters to think, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re kinda like me\u2019.\u201d\n\nWell, I\u2019m no expert, but I don\u2019t think *the kids* can really relate to his whale videos and use of classic dad music.\n\nIn a desperate effort to be relevant, the Premier even referenced Minecraft. That\u2019s what the kids are into these days, isn\u2019t it? Minecraft? Yeah. That sounds about right.\n\nOverall, Daniel Andrews isn\u2019t the worst politician in the world, but this isn\u2019t about his politics. This is about his cringe-inducing Tik Toks that make Reese Witherspoon embarrassing her son look like nothing.\n\nIf politicians could just stick to running the country and not making us watch videos of them walking around to The Proclaimers, that would be just dandy.", "description": "Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has made a Tik Tok account filled with truly cringe-worthy content in an attempt to make the government more accessible.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2017_07_13_at_1.jpg"}
