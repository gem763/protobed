This is despite both banks offering identical current account ranges and the same cash switch offers\n\nIndeed, an amalgamation of CASS data from personal finance site Moneycomms stated that since January 2014, NatWest has had just one positive quarter before this year when it comes to people switching either to it or away from it.\n\nMore than six million people have switched their current accounts using the service, with nearly a million of those coming over the past 12 months, CASS says.\n\nWhile NatWest's success is likely down to the \u00a3175 and \u00a3150 switch offers it ran from January to February, April to May and in September, offering customers bundles of cash is not always a guaranteed recipe for success.\n\nHSBC (which includes First Direct and M&S Bank) has persuaded nearly 74,000 people to switch since January by following a similar strategy, but NatWest's stablemate RBS, which has offered exactly the same switch bonuses as NatWest and often at the same time, has shed 25,438 accounts this year.\n\nIt means the high street giant has not had a single quarter since January 2014 in which it has seen a net gain of account holders switching through CASS.\n\nThe figures continue a fairly rough year for RBS; one of its recent switch offers was undermined by the fact its website crashed at the same time, and it was in August named as Britain's worst current account provider in a survey published by the Competition and Markets Authority.\n\nMeanwhile TSB's efforts to staunch the bleeding in the aftermath of its IT meltdown last year haven't been wholly successful, with the bank seeing more than 39,500 people switch accounts away this year.\n\nThe march of the digital banks continued unabated in the latest CASS figures, with Monzo and Starling combining for 20,000 new switchers between July and September\n\nHowever, it has at least reduced the losses every quarter, from 17,492, to 13,942, to 8,110.\n\nAnother trend which has continued is that digital challenger banks Monzo and Starling continue to siphon customers away from established high street names, with Monzo gaining a net 13,453 switchers in the last quarter, just a shade under the number who switched to HSBC and NatWest.\n\nStarling, which gained just over 6,600 accounts in the three months between July and September, meanwhile announced yesterday it raised \u00a330million in a funding round, with chief executive Anne Boden saying the bank was aiming to reach 'one million customers and \u00a31billion in deposits within weeks.'\n\nThe figures are encouraging for these challengers - they face a battle convincing people to switch their main bank account to them, including direct debits and salary payments, but this CASS data shows that more people are doing so.\n\nBut the biggest gainer once again was Nationwide Building Society. It gained 26,466 switchers between July to September.\n\nOverall, according to the Moneycomms research, the three biggest gainers by a considerable distance since the start of 2014 have been Nationwide, Santander and Halifax.\n\nHowever, Santander and Halifax saw switching numbers fall in this latest quarterly set of data, suggesting they face a task to start turning this into a positive figure once more.\n\nMeanwhile, Barclays trail at the bottom by a considerable distance. It - along with Lloyds Bank and RBS - has never had a quarter in which it has attracted a net inflow of switchers.\n\nBarclays has lost a net figure of nearly half a million current account switchers since CASS started recording the data.", "description": "A succession of juicy cash bribes has helped NatWest boost its number of bank account switchers by more than 37,500 over the first nine months of this year, new figures show.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
