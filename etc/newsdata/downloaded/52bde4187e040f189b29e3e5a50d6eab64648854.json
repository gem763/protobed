A national downtown revival trend is bringing interest from more affluent groups, including investors, to intown Atlanta.\n\nIt\u2019s a mostly welcome change but brings with it all the anxiety associated with gentrification.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing new people become interested in the community, and even though there has been a high rate of vacancy in the area, what you don\u2019t want to see is displacement,\u201d said Eloisa Klementich, president and CEO of Invest Atlanta. \u201cWe are doing all we can to keep our valued residents in the community. They should not be displaced, not on our watch.\u201d\n\n[Downsizing the American Dream: The new trend toward \u2018missing middle housing\u2019]\n\nAmong the city\u2019s responses is a ground-lease program designed to protect what Invest Atlanta describes as \u201clegacy residents\u201d who want a path to homeownership in their neighborhood but can\u2019t afford a mortgage.\n\nThrough the Atlanta Land Trust, home buyers using the ground-lease program purchase only the house itself, leasing land from the city at $1 annually on a 99-year ground lease. If the home is sold at a later date, the owners keep any appreciation on the structure, while the land remains in the city\u2019s hands in perpetuity.\n\nThe concept is under review in big cities such as Atlanta and metro Miami, plus small and mid-size areas, including Chesterfield County, Va.; Bend, Ore.; and Tacoma, Wash. Proponents say it lowers costs, increases neighborhood stability, creates pride of ownership and builds equity over time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about meeting people where they\u2019re at,\u201d Klementich said. \u201cSome people want to buy a home but are not quite there yet. If that\u2019s where you\u2019re at, this is a good option if you want to try out homeownership.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Habitat for Humanity home renovation project on Eggleston Street in Richmond, Va., will be sold through the Maggie Walker Community Land Trust. (Parker Michels-Boyce/For The Washington Post)\n\nIn Atlanta, one modular home has already been constructed on James P. Brawley Drive in English Avenue, with five more on the way. The home, featuring beige paint with white trim, a one-car garage and a small porch fronting a grass-covered yard, was delivered via truck and loaded into place by giant cranes. With a \u201cWe Love English Avenue\u201d sign perched out front, the house sits in a neighborhood with more than its share of abandoned properties, but also a small park and homes beginning to undergo renovation.\n\nIsaac Sanford, a 24-year-old bartender at the Moxy Atlanta Midtown hotel, lives at the Brawley Drive home. For now, he\u2019s just a renter, but hopes to own one of the ground-leased homes in the near future.\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite things about English Avenue is the access to the city and to midtown,\u201d said Sanford, an Atlanta native who has looked into traditional homeownership in the past but found it out of his reach. \u201cLiving in the actual house is great, too. It\u2019s not what people think of when they hear the word \u2018modular.\u2019 It feels like any other house.\u201d\n\nThe Invest Atlanta houses will have target price points from $135,000 to $160,000, significantly below the city\u2019s median home price of $275,000, according to the Atlanta Realtors Association.\n\n[The other housing crisis: Cities where home prices are low because people have left]\n\nIncluding down-payment assistance, the houses could be available to those earning between 60 and 80 percent area median income (AMI). According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, AMI in metro Atlanta was $74,800 for a family of four in 2018, so 60 percent AMI would be $44,880.\n\nNot only do residents purchasing ground-lease houses pay less in upfront and monthly costs, but they won\u2019t pay property taxes on the land and won\u2019t be subject to the price fluctuations that often accompany renting.\n\n\n\nTom Gillis stands in the backyard of the house that he purchased in 2018 through the Maggie Walker Community Land Trust. (Parker Michels-Boyce/For The Washington Post)\n\nGround leases have long been a common feature in commercial real estate. Vincent Yao, a Georgia State University Urban Studies Institute professor, points out that ground leases are also the norm in parts of Europe and Asia and that the added costs of land greatly increase the price of homeownership for Americans.\n\n\u201cWhen land is owned by a private individual, there\u2019s an open market to trade the land and these days, depending on where you are, buying land is not cheap,\u201d Yao said. \u201cLand typically accounts for a significant portion of the cost. In some places, the land costs more than the structure.\u201d\n\nWhile the number of units Invest Atlanta is creating may not have a major impact, Yao said ground leases can be an effective method of creating affordable units.\n\nGround leases aren\u2019t necessarily a new phenomenon with residential real estate in the United States either, but Atlanta is not alone in launching a program to try out the concept.\n\nChesterfield County, Va., near Richmond, has launched a program called the Maggie Walker Community Land Trust, which closed on its first home earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThe land trust was awarded a $500,000 grant to put nine houses under contract for homeownership,\u201d said Dan Cohen, director of the Chesterfield County Community Enhancement Department. \u201cThe land trust will sell the house to a resident, the resident has an equity interest in the house and can sell it when they want to go.\u201d\n\nChesterfield\u2019s program is the first in the Richmond area, population 1.2 million, and second in Virginia. AMI in metro Richmond is $67,633, and the ground-lease program targets buyers making 80 percent ($54,106) or below.\n\n\u201cThe market in Chesterfield is quite hot,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThe median home price is around $250,000, so to take that down $80,000 by removing land costs makes it much more reasonable for somebody to live here. . . . At 80 percent AMI, your target market becomes nurses, teachers, police folks.\u201d\n\nCohen said reaction from neighbors for or against the program has been muted, as most simply don\u2019t realize the involved houses are under a ground lease rather than a traditional fee simple model.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no visual identifier that this is a land-trust house,\u201d Cohen said.\n\n[One answer to the lack of affordable apartments might begin at home]\n\nThe land trust has already sold a few houses in Richmond proper, one of which is a two-bedroom, one-bathroom that went to \u00ad26-year-old architect Jeisson Apolo Armas for $145,000.\n\n\n\nAmeriCorps workers Courtney Grantham and Benjamin Veilleux pick up supplies at a Habitat for Humanity house. (Parker Michels-Boyce/For The Washington Post)\n\nA native of Ecuador who said he grew up in a low-income household, Armas moved to Richmond from New York City after college in hopes of finding cheaper land. But houses in Richmond were still out of his reach until he learned about the Maggie Walker Community Land Trust.\n\nThe house Armas purchased is older, built as a part of a streetcar suburb and recently renovated by Habitat for Humanity. He said he hopes to stay in it for roughly five years before trading in his equity and crossing the bridge to full homeownership.\n\n\u201cThey find people who are on the verge and can almost reach homeownership, and give them that extra boost,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is so helpful because buying a house is not always easy. We don\u2019t all have stocks, trust funds or savings accounts.\u201d\n\nThe central Oregon city of Bend, with a metro population of 175,000, last year introduced a ground-lease program called K\u00f4r Community Land Trust. The group plans to place fives houses under ground leases in its first round.\n\n\u201cA lot of the folks we\u2019re providing homeownership opportunities for are public service workers,\u201d said Amy Warren, co-founder and executive director of the land trust. \u201cWe depend on them to make our community and economy function. Allowing them an opportunity to put roots down through homeownership and stable housing is a lot different than putting a family in a rental unit.\u201d\n\nShe said K\u00f4r is helping provide homes for teachers, builders, servers and maintenance workers. Bend has a median household income of $52,471, with a median home cost near $450,000. Warren said she recently pulled income data for local school system employees, which is public record, and found that many would qualify for a home through the program.\n\nK\u00f4r will charge around $50 or $60 monthly to lease land for each home, plus a separate homeowners association fee. The long-term plan is to offer 25 percent of homes to those at or near AMI, and 75 percent to low or very low income earners.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to keep doing this as long as there\u2019s a need, which I don\u2019t see going away any time soon,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThe biggest challenge is the search for land, because land has such a high value.\u201d\n\nAs with Atlanta, Warren said she hopes the program will allow long-term residents to own a home and stay in town.\n\nIt\u2019s a battle Precious Muhammad, who lived in Atlanta\u2019s English Avenue for 10 years and owns a property in Vine City, knows well. She is a flight attendant who is also involved in the local real estate scene, and she said it\u2019s a challenge for long-term residents to stay in their homes.\n\n\u201cStabilization is what the community needs,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people have lost their property just because of the taxes. A ground lease allows people to maintain a budget month to month.\u201d", "description": "A ground-lease program can offer residents a more accessible path to homeownership.", "authors": ["Haisten Willis"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/c281AxJ971OLp8-xpUmNgR0q4rU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FTVE33WFZYI6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg"}
