I would always go for the latter option.'\n\nA Brexit deal that passes the Commons and delivers Brexit would seriously hamper the Brexit Party as it heard into the upcoming election, removing almost its entire reason for existing at a swipe.\n\nMr Farage has previously suggested the Tories enter an electoral pact with his party and he did so again today.\n\n'If withdrawal agreement four fails on Saturday, as I believe it will, I think then Boris Johnson as Prime Minister would drop the idea of this new treaty and there is a possibility of putting together a Leave alliance for the next general election,' he said.\n\n'I think there is an opportunity here for a Brexit alliance to fight the elections that would win a big majority in Parliament.'", "description": "The Brexit Party leader lashed out at the compromise hammered out by the Prime Minister with Brussels and claimed it would be thrown out by MPs.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/13/19836480-0-image-a-5_1571316313623.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
