Remember that day do ya? Crying like a little baby, I even think you wet yourself.\n\n\"We're finished Ben, finished. Do you understand me? My wife is coming home with my kids.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nHe then threatened to come after him if he caused him any more touble.\n\nLater on Ben too referenced the moment they shared back in the day, before getting Martin trapped in his world yet again.\n\nHe said: \"I do remember that day on the bridge obviously. Dangling a little kid with glasses and a hearing aid off a bridge... you must have really felt like the tough guy. Didn't have the guts to mess with someone your own size.\n\n\"I'm a bit bigger now and until I say so you work for me.\"\n\nEastEnders airs Mondays and Fridays at 8pm, and Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:30pm on BBC One .", "description": "EastEnders aired dramatic scenes on Friday night, as Ben Mitchell hinted the reason he was targeting Martin Fowler", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561753.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_EMB-18685203-high_res-eastenders-october-december-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
