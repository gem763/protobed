Radically industrial for its time, entrepreneur Gustave Eiffel\u2019s modern monument was written off as a monstrous gimmick for the impending World\u2019s Fair. When Chinese-US architect IM Pei set about creating his landmark Louvre Pyramid (1989), an enormous glass-and-steel sculpture that serves as the main entrance to the world\u2019s most visited museum, he couldn\u2019t have foreseen that his bold design would initially be labelled \u2018atrocious\u2019, that its structure would spark an enduring Satanic conspiracy theory or that the Louvre\u2019s then-director would resign in protest. And just earlier this year, French-Portuguese artist Joana Vasconcelos\u2019s revolving red heart sculpture Coeur de Paris, a permanent installation in the 18th arrondissement, outraged politicians and public alike due to its hefty price tag.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- The artists who \u2018spoke\u2019 to the dead\n\n- William Blake: The greatest visionary in 200 years\n\n- \u2018Disarmingly intimate\u2019 photos of women\n\nThe list of public artworks that have ruffled Parisians\u2019 feathers for one reason or another goes on. But with his divisive Bouquet of Tulips, unveiled in the gardens of the Petit Palais this weekend, scandal magnate Jeff Koons is now in a position to snatch the trophy from them all. Of course, the US artist is no stranger to controversy. The former Wall Street commodities broker turned neo-Pop sculptor carries a reputation as the preferred artist of the 0.01%: a former Goldman Sachs executive purchased his Rabbit statue for a record-setting $91.1 million (\u00a374.1m) in May. Koons\u2019 2008 Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles exhibition of balloon animals ignited the ire of protesters, who accused him of cheapening this sacred French site. And he has repeatedly (recently, even) been found guilty of plagiarism.\n\nStill, it could be argued that this polychromed bronze and stainless-steel sculpture is his most controversial artwork yet. Christened the \u201ctulips of discord\u201d by some of the French press, the artist has described the 12m and 33-tonne bouquet of an outstretched hand holding his signature balloon tulips as \u201ca symbol of remembrance, optimism and healing\u201d with the missing 12th tulip representing the victims of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. Inspired by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi\u2019s neoclassical Statue of Liberty (1886) \u2013 a gift from the citizens of France to the US \u2013 and Pablo Picasso\u2019s Bouquet de L\u2019Amiti\u00e9 (1958) lithograph, Koons \u2018donated\u2019 the \u20ac3.5m (\u00a33.1m) artwork (well, the idea for it, as the project was financed through private philanthropy and generous tax reliefs) to the city of Paris to \u201cexpress the painful context of the attacks into a symbolic work\u201d.\n\nBut not everyone has felt the love.\n\nWhat shocked me was the association being made between this type of \u2018gift\u2019 and the terrorist attacks, when it had nothing to do with them \u2013 Marie-Claude Beaud\n\nSince the project was unveiled in 2016, there has been considerable criticism: unforgiving online petitions condemning what they describe as a tasteless product placement; newspaper op-eds questioning the artist\u2019s ulterior motives; tense negotiations over the sculpture\u2019s eventual location. Marie-Claude Beaud, director of the Nouveau Mus\u00e9e National de Monaco, was among 23 French arts professionals (including filmmaker Olivier Assayas and former French culture minister Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand) who signed a 2018 letter in Lib\u00e9ration calling out what they saw as an \u201copportunistic and cynical\u201d project, given the artist\u2019s intent to install the sculpture between two prized contemporary arts institutions entirely unrelated to the tragedies. \u201cWhat shocked me was the association being made between this type of \u2018gift\u2019 and the terrorist attacks, when it had nothing to do with them,\u201d Beaud tells BBC Culture. \u201cAnd gifts should be free. Especially when your name is Jeff Koons and you\u2019re a billionaire.\u201d\n\nAccording to sociologist Kim M Babon, a specialist of cultural conflict in public art, people tend to be upset whenever the execution of a piece doesn\u2019t match their expectations. \u201cArt is an interesting lightning rod because it\u2019s arguably not an absolute need,\u201d she tells BBC Culture. \u201cWhat makes it controversial is that it becomes something we can question: \u2018Why does money need to be spent on it? Why this piece of art, there? And who gets to decide?\u2019\u201d\n\nMarie-Claude Beaud points to Les Deux Plateaux (1985-86) by French artist Daniel Buren as an example of a scandal-sparking contemporary installation she unequivocally championed at the time. Commissioned to replace an unsightly parking lot in the Palais Royal\u2019s inner courtyard, the initial response to its 260 black-and-white-striped columns of varying heights was one of general disdain, with many deeming it unsuitable for and incongruous with such a historic landmark, among other things. But 30 years later, Les Deux Plateaux is widely revered. \u201cI think Daniel is delighted to see so many people making it their own: taking selfies on the shorter stumps and sitting down to picnic there,\u201d says Beaud. Proof that public art is first and foremost about creating a dialogue with the audience.\n\nIf art doesn\u2019t elicit a response or reaction, it means it\u2019s not art \u2013 Christophe Girard\n\nFrom a plethora of pieces dismissing Koons as the \u201cWonder Bread of contemporary American art\u201d to letters in newspapers calling for Parisians to accept his gift, much conflicting ink has been spilled about the matter, which the Paris deputy mayor for culture finds reassuring. \u201cI think it\u2019s very healthy in a democracy for art to spark debate and controversy,\u201d Christophe Girard tells BBC Culture. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen petitions like this since the Eiffel Tower. If art doesn\u2019t elicit a response or reaction, it means it\u2019s not art. Those protecting Paris\u2019s incredibly rich heritage didn\u2019t want the artwork located on the esplanade of the Palais de Tokyo, and they were right. So we had to find an appropriate compromise.\u201d Its chosen setting near the US embassy, behind the Petit Palais, which also houses works by Koons favourite Gustave Courbet, resolved what Girard qualified as a \u201cmatter of cultural diplomacy\u201d.\n\nThe spectacle of commemoration\n\nUS art historian Erika Doss has extensively researched and written about public art memorials. She regards Bouquet of Tulips as symptomatic of a culture wherein the spectacle of commemoration becomes the event itself, more than the tragedy being commemorated. \u201cWe have a horrible trauma, and increasingly, we want to go to these sites in order to touch and feel the tragic events that happened there,\u201d she tells BBC Culture. \u201cWe still go to cemeteries and national memorials like the Washington Monument, but we increasingly go to places where shootings or bombings have occurred. This isn\u2019t particularly new; we just see more of it in the media. And I think more commemorative and memorial projects have been created around them. Bouquet of Tulips is a perfect example.\u201d\n\nFran\u00e7oise Monnin is an art historian and editor-in-chief at Artension magazine. She launched the very first petition against Bouquet of Tulips three years ago, suggesting that the city commission another artist to conjure up a monument to Paris\u2019s dead and wounded. \u201cThere are so many around the world, and they often carry a devastating sense of sadness. The Val de gr\u00e2ce (1977) by Jean-Robert Ipoust\u00e9guy, for instance, on display in the military hospital of the same name in Paris (after having ignited its own controversy for years) is an extraordinary bronze sculpture, which evokes death but also life and brotherhood.\u201d\n\nBack in the 1980s you had to produce a figure on a horse, a tall obelisk or something shooting up into the sky \u2013 Kim M Babon\n\nBut Girard is quick to mention that Bouquet of Tulips wasn\u2019t a public commission initiated by victims\u2019 associations, and that not a single penny of public money has been spent. \u201cThis is rather a present from the US with this artwork against violence, attacks, terrorism and hatred \u2013 in general,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cKoons will also donate all income generated from Bouquet\u2019s by-products to the 2015-2016 terrorist attack victims\u2019 associations and towards the sculpture\u2019s maintenance.\u201d\n\nWhile Bouquet of Tulips is not described as a memorial per se, sociologist Kim M Babon believes the debate around it is reminiscent of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington (1982), designed by Yale undergraduate Maya Lin, who\u2019d won a public design competition. While it initially sparked widespread anger at what some regarded as a less traditional, too subtle and even disrespectful memorial monument \u2013 low-lying, polished black granite walls etched with the names of all honoured servicemen \u2013 it\u2019s now appreciated, 30 years later. \u201cBack in the 1980s, and this is again about expectations \u2013 what was considered the proper way to memorialise people \u2013 you had to produce a figure on a horse, a tall obelisk or something shooting up into the sky,\u201d explains Babon. \u201cLin\u2019s approach to a memorial was unusual and atypical\u201d.\n\nThe dramatic shift in public response occurred \u201conce the lived experience of the monument came to invalidate people\u2019s previous expectations of what a memorial should be\u201d, according to Babon. By the same token, it\u2019ll be up to Parisians and tourists alike to make up their own minds about Bouquet of Tulips once the furore has fully died down and they just happen to walk past it.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Pyramid, Les Deux Plateaux and so many others have gone from problematic points of friction to celebrated landmarks. Building on that, Girard hopes Bouquet can become a \u201csymbol of friendship between two democracies, and a place of dreams, love, engagement and promise instead of rupture\u201d. Of course, as art historian Fran\u00e7oise Monnin rightfully argues, the points of view that ultimately matter will be those \u201cindependent of political courtesies of France to the US, and liberated from the pressures exerted by Koons\u2019 collectors and dealers\u201d. After all, public art only lives for as long as the public finds it meaningful.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.
