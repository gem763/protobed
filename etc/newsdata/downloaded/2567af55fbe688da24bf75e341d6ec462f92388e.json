If they do have the disease, they will be just the fifth patient to be diagnosed on European soil.\n\nIt comes just months after an Ebola outbreak in the Congo, deemed the second biggest in history, was declared an international emergency.\n\nThe death toll in the African nation soared past 2,000 and the number of cases has hit 3,000.\n\nIn January, another Swedish patient was feared to have been struck down with the virus.\n\nThe young man was kept in isolation at the University Hospital in Uppsala as medics scrambled to work out whether he was truly infected.\n\nEbola, a haemorrhagic fever, killed at least 11,000 across the world after it decimated West Africa and spread rapidly over the space of two years.\n\nIt was first spotted in regions close to the River Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which gave the disease its name.\n\nThat pandemic was officially declared over back in January 2016, when Liberia was announced to be Ebola-free by the WHO.\n\nThe Ebola death toll in the Democratic Republic of Congo tops 2,000 a year after the outbreak was declared, government data shows\n\nThe fever spread rapidly during an epidemic in 2014, with cases reported in 10 countries - including eight in the US.\n\nMany aid agencies volunteered to help stop it spreading, including British nurse Pauline Cafferkey, who was left critically ill by the deadly disease.\n\nShe became the first victim of the epidemic to be diagnosed on British soil and spent almost a month in an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in north-west London.\n\nMs Cafferkey was readmitted to hospitals with Ebola complications twice in 2016.\n\nA Spanish healthcare worker became the first person to catch Ebola outside of Africa in October 2014, after caring for a patient repatriated from Sierra Leone. She recovered after a month-long stay in hospital.\n\nThe virus was then detected on Italian soil in May, when a healthcare worker flew back to Rome after volunteering in Sierra Leone. He did not display symptoms for three days and was allowed home from hospital the following month.\n\nScientists believe Ebola is most often passed to humans by fruit bats, but antelope, porcupines, gorillas and chimpanzees could also be to blame.\n\nIt can be transmitted between humans through blood, secretions and other bodily fluids of people - and surfaces - that have been infected.", "description": "The patient was rushed to Skane University Hospital in Lund on Monday after suffering\u00a0symptoms linked to the killer virus.
