Trump\u2019s rationale? He promised to bring our soldiers home.\n\nThere could be another reason. Trump never divested from his real estate business, and the Trump Towers Istanbul is the Trump Organization\u2019s first and only office and residential building in Europe. Businesses linked to the Turkish government are also major patrons of the Trump Organization. Which may be why Trump has repeatedly sided with the Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who has been intent on eliminating the Kurds.\n\nBack home, Trump has separated families at the border, locked migrant children in cages and tried to ban Muslims from entering the country. He says he wants to protect America\u2019s borders.\n\nUnder Trump, thuggery has replaced diplomacy\n\nBut guarding America\u2019s geographic borders isn\u2019t nearly as important as guarding the integrity of American democracy, which Trump has repeatedly compromised for personal political gain. He did this on 25 July when he asked the president of Ukraine to do him a personal \u201cfavor\u201d by digging up dirt on Joe Biden, his most likely 2020 opponent.\n\nTrump justifies his trade war with China as protecting America from Chinese predation. But he asked China to start an investigation of Biden, and last week his adviser on China conceded he spoke with Chinese officials about the former vice-president.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, Trump publicly called on Russia to find Hillary Clinton\u2019s missing emails. Within hours, Russian agents sought to do just that by trying to break into her computer servers.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller found that Russia sought to help Trump get elected, and Trump\u2019s campaign welcomed the help.\n\nNow Trump is playing at being a double foreign agent \u2013 pushing the prime minister of Australia, among others, to gather information to discredit Mueller.\n\nRudy Giuliani is Trump\u2019s international thug, arranging deals with foreign powers. On Wednesday, two of Giuliani\u2019s business associates were arrested in connection with a criminal scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for office, including donations to a Super Pac formed to support Trump.\n\nUnder Trump, thuggery has replaced diplomacy. On Friday, in an opening statement for congressional impeachment investigators, Marie Yovanovitch, former US ambassador to Ukraine, said people associated with Giuliani \u201cmay well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine\u201d.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be an originalist to see the dangers when a president seeks personal favors from foreign governments\n\nMeanwhile, even as Trump spews conspiracy theories about the Biden family, his own children are openly profiting from foreign deals. Eric and Don Jr have projects in the works in Ireland, India, Indonesia, Uruguay, Turkey and the Philippines.\n\nTrump is pocketing money from foreign governments eager to curry favor by staying at his hotels. The practice has become so routine that during Trump\u2019s 25 July phone call, the Ukrainian president assured him that the \u201clast time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower\u201d.\n\nAccording to a former Trump Organization official, foreign governments spent more than a million dollars at Trump businesses in 2018, mostly at the Trump International hotel in Washington. Trump will make even more money if he carries out his plan to host next year\u2019s G7 meeting at his Doral golf resort, in Florida.\n\nAll of this is precisely what the founding fathers sought to prevent.\n\nWhen they gathered in Philadelphia 232 years ago to write a constitution, a major goal was to protect the new nation from what Alexander Hamilton called the \u201cdesire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils\u201d.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Ukraine call could get him impeached \u2013 but his Syria betrayal is worse | Jonathan Freedland\n\nTo ensure no president would \u201cbetray his trust to foreign powers\u201d, as James Madison put it, they included an emoluments clause \u2013 barring a president from accepting foreign payments.", "description": "The founding fathers said betraying America to foreign powers was an impeachable offense.
