Meanwhile, a Tigers defense that entered allowing 12.3 points per contest, held potent Louisville (4-3, 2-2) to 263 yards, recorded six sacks and forced three turnovers.\n\nNo. 5 Oklahoma 52, West Virginia 14\n\nJalen Hurts threw for three touchdowns and ran for two more as the Sooners blew out the Mountaineers in Norman, Okla., and improved to 7-0 for the first time since 2004.\n\nHurts completed all but one of his 17 pass attempts for 316 yards. He also ran for 75 yards. CeeDee Lamb and Charleston Rambo each had 71 receiving yards for Oklahoma (7-0, 4-0 Big 12), with Rambo finding the end zone.\n\nThe win spoiled the return of Austin Kendall, who spent the last three years at Oklahoma backing up Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray before transferring to West Virginia (3-4, 1-3) in the offseason.

He finished with 21 carries for a season-best 179 yards.\n\nThanks to the play of the defense, that would be more than enough for Georgia (6-1, 3-1 SEC) to secure the win as Kentucky (3-4, 1-4) managed just 177 total yards -- only 17 through the air. The Wildcats completed only two of 16 pass attempts.\n\nNo. 11 Auburn 51, Arkansas 10\n\nBo Nix passed for a season-high three touchdowns and ran for another as the Tigers beat the Razorbacks in Fayetteville, Ark., to improve to 9-0 after an open date under coach Gus Malzahn.\n\nAuburn (6-1, 3-1 SEC) ran for 298 yards in its first game without leading rusher JaTarvious Whitlow, out with a knee injury.

He has 3,264 career yards.\n\nTyler Huntley threw for 171 yards and an interception on 12-of-19 passing before exiting with a leg injury in the fourth quarter.

The conversion followed Kansas quarterback Carter Stanley's 22-yard touchdown to Stephon Robinson Jr.\n\nSam Ehlinger passed for 399 yards, four touchdowns and one interception for Texas (5-2, 3-1 Big 12), while Keaontay Ingram ran for 101 yards on 14 carries, including a 4-yard touchdown with 2:47 to play that gave the Longhorns a short-lived 47-40 lead.

The undefeated Mustangs have posted their best start since 1982, when Eric Dickerson and Craig James led them to an 11-0-1 season.\n\nRoberson finished with eight catches for 250 yards as SMU outgained the Owls 655-273. Anthony Russo passed for 171 yards and ran for a score to pace Temple (5-2, 2-1) in a matchup of AAC division co-leaders.\n\nNo. 20 Minnesota 42, Rutgers 7\n\nRodney Smith rushed for 111 yards and two touchdowns on 19 carries as the Golden Gophers improved to 7-0 for the first time since 1960 by beating host Rutgers 42-7 in Piscataway, N.J.\n\nAustin Winfield intercepted two passes, returning one for a touchdown, for Minnesota (4-0 Big Ten), which has won nine straight games dating to last season.
