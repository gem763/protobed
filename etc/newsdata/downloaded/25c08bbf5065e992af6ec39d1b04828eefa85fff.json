That was the lowest reading since March 2009. He believes the risk of recession is real and serious.\n\nTim Fiore, president of the Institute for Supply Management, told FOX Business on Tuesday that an ongoing strike at General Motors did not artificially suppress data on the manufacturing sector last month, which some had posited as a plausible explanation for the bad reading. Currently, the report \u201cpurely\u201d reflects a lack of demand and a lack of orders, Fiore said.\n\nMeanwhile, business investment in the second quarter declined at the fastest rate since the final quarter of 2015, and GDP in the second quarter grew at a rate of 2% \u2014 below the 2.6% seen throughout the first half of 2019.\n\nFOX Business\u2019 Jennifer Schonberger contributed to this report.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "It\u2019s not just dismal manufacturing numbers signaling the recession risk is real.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/iStock-payment.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
