With his right hand, he holds it high above his head, with his left he points me to the touchline. For a split second my mind goes blank, just unable to compute what I\u2019m seeing. Then a single thought goes through my head. Don\u2019t complain. Don\u2019t argue, don\u2019t remonstrate, don\u2019t protest.\u201d\n\nNearly eight years after being sent off in what was at the time the biggest match of his career, Sam Warburton reflects in his book Open Side about the infamous red card against France in the 2011 Rugby World Cup semi-final. Who\u2019d have thought that a month later, eight years and five days on from that fateful day, the story would be oh so similar.\n\nA red card, a second-half Welsh fightback and World Cup hopes on the line, only this time it wasn\u2019t Wales going home. This time, it wasn\u2019t the Wales captain sent-off, but the hero-to-villain French lock Sebastien Vahaamahina.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

A similar acceptance, but no doubt at all.\n\nThere are many similarities to 2011 but it\u2019s the differences that make this story a happy ending for Wales. Once again, the team that won did not deserve to, not by a country mile, and in an instant a red-card offence completely changed the outlook of the match. For Warburton\u2019s tip-tackle on Vincent Clerc, we can now read Vahaamahina\u2019s astonishing deliberate elbow on Aaron Wainwright \u2013 astonishing in that just how did he expect to get away with it?\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty Images 2/31 <b>Wales:</b> Liam Williams - 6 France did an excellent job of kicking away from him to limit his involvement, with few chances to show what he can do. Getty Images 3/31 George North - 6 Excellent tackle stopped Fickou early on, but was intercepted by Huget when Wales had a three-man overlap as they were desperately searching for the try. Didn\u2019t have a great game by all accounts, but then not many in red did. AFP via Getty Images 4/31 Owen Watkin - 5 Had big shoes to fill in Jonathan Davies\u2019s last-minute absence, but didn\u2019t show his best and showed what Wales lose without Davies in the side. Getty Images 5/31 Hadleigh Parkes - 5 Made no impact whatsoever with ball in hand and the fact that he was thumped backwards by Huget sums up the Welsh performance. Getty Images 6/31 Josh Adams - 6 Tried to come off his wing in an effort to get involved in the game but could not find anything come his way as he was starved of ball. World Rugby via Getty Images 7/31 Dan Biggar - 6 100 per cent record from the tee and his kicking from hand was average, if not good, but will need to work out how to get his back line firing again. At least he showed o signs of the recent concussions he\u2019s suffered. AFP via Getty Images 8/31 Gareth Davies - 5 Didn\u2019t look his normal lively self as France contained him around the fringe, and he made no impact off the defensive line in attempting his trademark interceptions. REUTERS 9/31 Wyn Jones - 5 Quiet in attack, quiet in defence, Just quiet, really. AP 10/31 Ken Owens - 6 Wales\u2019s most prominent defender as he led the tackling charts. Breathed a huge sigh of relief when his intercepted 25-metre pass was ruled inconsequential due to a knock-on advantage, as Guirado galloped over for what he thought was France\u2019s fourth try. REUTERS 11/31 Tomas Francis - 5 Conceded a penalty early on and struggled in the scrum, though contributed well in defence. REUTERS 12/31 Jake Ball - 6 Made one impactful tackle that sent the French into reverse, but his place is coming under threat from the returning Adam Beard. AFP via Getty Images 13/31 Alun Wyn Jones - 6 Got little change out of the French defence with the ball in hand, but his defensive effort was at the highest degree that we\u2019ve come to expect. REUTERS 14/31 Aaron Wainwright - 7 Sprung into life to snap up the loose ball and gallop away for his try that kicked Wales into life with a much-needed score to stem the flow. Was on the receiving end of Vahaamahina\u2019s disgraceful elbow in the second half, but on the whole it was another good showing from the youngster. AFP via Getty Images 15/31 Justin Tipuric - 6 Played a key role in the match-winning try by catching the rip and taking it to the line. Spent a lot of time out wide, which didn\u2019t always help his side. Getty Images 16/31 Josh Navidi - 5 Suffered a hamstring injury in the first half that forced him off. Replacement Ross Moriarty joined him minutes later when he was sent to the sin-bin, though he redeemed himself with the match-winning try. Getty Images 17/31 <b>France:</b> Maxime Medard - 7 Kicked smartly until his rash decision to attempt a drop-goal from halfway saw him grubber the ball instead. Part of a French back line that dazzled throughout the first half as he caused Wales all sorts of problems with his offloading in the tackle. AFP via Getty Images 18/31 Damian Penaud - 7 On another day he could have scored a hat-trick, but he did set up a beauty for Vakatawa as he split Biggar and Owens before offloading to the centre. He was guilty of dropping one with the line in front of him in the second half. AFP via Getty Images 19/31 Virimi Vakatawa - 8 Possibly his best performance in a France shirt. He caused all sorts of problems for the Welsh defence, scoring a try himself and knocking Biggar into next week with one emphatic charge. AFP via Getty Images 20/31 Gael Fickou - 8 Made a superb start to the match as he ran riot with Ntamack, cutting through the gaps left in the Welsh line. Could have scored early on had it now been for North\u2019s excellent tackle. EPA 21/31 Yoann Huget - 6 Made a thumping tackle on Parkes and intercepted North crucially when Wales had a three-man overlap, but otherwise he was strangely quiet. AFP via Getty Images 22/31 Romain Ntamack - 8 Ran the show throughout the first half with a stunning display of running rugby. Brought his outside backs into play beautifully that Wales simply could not contend with. Played a key role in Ollivon\u2019s try that will go down as one of the best at the tournament. AFP via Getty Images 23/31 Antoine Dupont - 7 Mixed up his play well with a blend of runs and kicks. Was on hand to take an offload from Ntamack and feed Ollivon to score the second try. AFP via Getty Images 24/31 Jefferson Poirot - 7 Won a penalty against Francis early on and made a strong contribution defensively. You could visibly see the role he\u2019s taken on within this team as he tried to lead the pack. PA 25/31 Guilhem Guirado - 6 Lost possession of the ball in contact with Ball that lead to Wainwright\u2019s breakaway try. Reliable in the lineout but disappointed slightly with his carrying. Decision to replace him straight after the red card was a puzzling one. AFP via Getty Images 26/31 Rabah Slimani - 7 Stood strong in the scrum, but needed to do more with the ball and missed two tackles. Getty Images 27/31 Bernard le Roux - 6 In the unfamiliar position of lock that stemmed his talents around the ruck. REUTERS 28/31 Sebastien Vahaamahina - 3 Got the ball rolling with the opening try of the game, only to go from hero to villain with a stupid deliberate elbow to the head of Wainwright that earned him a straight red card and swung the game in Wales\u2019s favour. AFP via Getty Images 29/31 Wenceslas Lauret - 6 Ran good support lines on occasion but could have done more defensively when the going got tough. AFP via Getty Images 30/31 Charles Ollivon - 7 On the shoulder of Dupont to inherit the ball and finish from range for the second try, and nearly found himself with another chance soon after in chasing a loose ball. A good showing. AFP via Getty Images 31/31 Gregory Alldritt - 7 Stood out with Ollivon in the back-row as he made important runs for his side.

AFP via Getty Images\n\nJacques Brunel had no complaints, the outgoing French head coach having been let down by someone he had returned to in order to give a struggling French pack a bit of bite. And so he did in the fifth minute when he bundled his way over the line to open the scoring in a rampant first half for Les Bleus.\n\nWarren Gatland, Brunel\u2019s counterpart, had sympathy for Vahaamahina, perhaps remembering the painful feeling of having a player of his own sent off on such a grand stage. \u201cUnfortunately that's what rugby is about now \u2013 it's heat of the moment stuff and he made an error of judgement,\u201d the Kiwi said.\n\nBut that understanding cast over the fact that on this performance, Wales deserved to go home. France were the better side by a long distance and it was nigh-on impossible to work out how they had not won the match: 157 more metres carried, 10 more defenders beaten 10 fewer missed tackle, 12 more offloads. Everything said that France would cause the upset of the quarter-finals that we were waiting for.\n\nOnly they snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, mistakes that Brunel criticised in what looks set to be his final post-match press conference not just as France boss but as a rugby coach at all. Brunel said: \u201cWe should have reacted differently. We didn\u2019t show enough character because we had opportunities maybe not to kill the match but stretch the lead beyond six, which is why in the outcome of the match it\u2019s difficult to accept.\u201d\n\nIt would be unfair to say this was karma for 2011. Warburton\u2019s tackle was illegal, and while the debate raged around whether it was fair, a penalty, yellow or red back then, nowadays it would result in the harshest form of sanction more often than not. Vahaamahina, however much testosterone was coursing through his veins \u2013 as Warren Gatland put it \u2013 would\u2019ve been red in any generation.\n\nYet the similarities from 2011 to 2018 are uncanny in what are now the only two World Cup meetings between these two nations, only this time Wales dug that little bit deeper to get out of trouble and find the answer to prolong their World Cup journey. That\u2019s the difference.", "description": "\u201cRolland reaches into his pocket and pulls out the red card.
