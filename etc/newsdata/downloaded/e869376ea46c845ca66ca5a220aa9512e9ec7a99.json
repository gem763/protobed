This is now the second occasion I've asked them to do my nails and been turned away.\n\n'I walked in and there were sitting down with other customers, but started looking over at my hands. I hadn't even had chance to speak before they said no.\n\n'I mentioned that it was fine and I'd just book for another day, but she said she couldn't do that either. She kept just saying no. They said 'it is too hard for me to do your twisted hands'.\n\n'I could have argued until I was blue in the face but I left. It was humiliating.'\n\nThe single mother had wanted to improve her 'body positivity' by getting her nails done while her young son was at school\n\nThe single mother had wanted to improve her 'body positivity' by getting her nails done while her young son was at school.\n\nMiss Phipps said: 'There are several nail bars [around here] and I've been to a number of them before.

We advised you that to do your nail due to the fact that we would not be able to position yourself safely, without causing you great discomfort,' the statement read\n\n'I had no issues getting into the shop or going up to the desk. There was no problems with access and I had my carer with me anyway.\n\n'I don't see why there would be any reason for them to turn me away.\n\n'Being body positive is a big part of my identity. A lot of people would stop going out for this kind of thing. I've had no response from them.

Symptoms are present at birth and contractures usually affect the legs or arms. Symptoms include contractures, abnormally slender or fragile long bones, cleft palate, abnormalities of the nervous system. There is no known reasons why AMC occurs. AMC affects 1 in 3,000 people and an equal number of males and females have the condition.
