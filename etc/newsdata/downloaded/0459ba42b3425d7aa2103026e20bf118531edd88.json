China reciprocated with new duties on U.S. crude oil.\n\nIn China, the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for August rose to a five-month high of 50.4 from 49.9 in July, beating a median market forecast and exceeding the 50-point level that separates contraction from growth on a monthly basis.\n\nThe reading followed Beijing\u2019s official PMI that showed factory activity shrank in August for the fourth month in a row, pointing to a further slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nIndia, another Asian economic power-house, saw the slowest expansion in its manufacturing sector in 15 months as demand and output grew at their weakest pace in a year.\n\nData on Friday showed India\u2019s economic growth hit a 6-year low in April-June, raising chances of the central bank cutting interest rates further at its next meeting.\n\nGLOOM MAY HIT SERVICES\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Japanese manufacturing activity fell for a fourth straight month in August, underlining a darkening outlook for the world\u2019s third-largest economy.\n\nWhile Japan\u2019s exports slipped for an eighth month in July due to slumping China-bound sales, the economy has so far enjoyed steady growth thanks to robust domestic demand.\n\nBut there are signs the economy may start to lose the support from consumption and capital expenditure.\n\nManufacturers surveyed in the PMI data said the end of a construction spike ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games and a scheduled sales tax hike in October are expected to hurt output volumes the coming months.\n\nAny further sign of weakness in domestic demand could add pressure on the Bank of Japan to ramp up stimulus at its rate review on Sept. 18-19, which follows the European Central Bank\u2019s rate decision and that of the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.-China trade war is escalating and we\u2019re also seeing tensions heighten between Washington and Europe,\u201d which could cause the global economy to falter, said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.\n\n\u201cJapan may slide into recession around the time the sales tax hike takes effect,\u201d he added.\n\nSouth Korean\u2019s factory activity also shrank as manufacturers felt the pinch not just from the U.S.-China trade war but an escalating diplomatic dispute with Japan.\n\nThe country\u2019s exports tumbled in August for a ninth straight month on sluggish demand from its biggest buyer, China, and depressed prices of computer chips globally.\n\nThe bleak data strengthened the case for additional policy easing by South Korea\u2019s central bank, following a surprise interest rate cut in July.\n\n\u201cThe simple message is number one, the U.S. and China are at logger heads, and China is already proactively responding and basically started to divorce itself from the regional supply chain,\u201d said Michael Every, senior Asia-Pacific strategist at Rabobank.\n\n\u201cEventually the service sector will be dragged down by the manufacturing sector.\u201d", "description": "The bitter trade war between China and the United States kept Asian factory activity mostly in decline in August, business surveys showed, strengthening the case for policymakers to unleash fresh stimulus to fend off recession risks.", "authors": ["Leika Kihara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425277044&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810CD"}
