Bargainers have met daily, including over the weekend, from early morning until evening. In a letter sent to UAW members Wednesday afternoon, Terry Dittes, vice president for the UAW's GM Department, said UAW negotiators have been working \"countless hours\" to reach a tentative contract with GM.\n\nBargainers broke off early Wednesday evening and were to resume talks Thursday morning.\n\nUAW workers on strike against General Motors and other supporters walk the picket line outside of General Motors Detroit-Hamtramck on Wednesday, September 25, 2019 while waiting for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders to arrive for a brief stop to the auto plant. More\n\n'Just in time'\n\nAt Motor City Buick GMC, Pitre said he has plenty of GM vehicles left to sell.\n\n\u201cThe pipeline of vehicles for us is about two weeks deep, so we haven\u2019t felt anything yet because everything that we\u2019ve ordered is still moving towards us,\" said Pitre.\n\nBut repair parts are often ordered on an as needed basis.\n\n\"We have lots of those that are en route and we have lots of vehicles that are in need of parts,\" Pitre said. He has about 50 vehicles awaiting parts for repairs, normally he has about 15.\n\n\u201cMost customers are being understanding,\" said Pitre. \"We\u2019re digging through other dealers\u2019 parts to get what we can and looking in the aftermarket. But there are things you can\u2019t get, especially for a newer vehicle.\"\n\nGeorge Matick Chevrolet in Redford, Michigan, said it, too, has \"a little bit of an issue\" with getting parts.\n\n\"We're feeling it with certain parts. It has to do mostly with special-order parts that are not in abundance in dealerships for trade,\" said dealer Paul Zimmerman of George Matick Chevrolet.\n\nA special-order part could be any braking system part for a Chevrolet Corvette, for example.\n\n\"But we've been OK for the standard stuff, you need a brake for an Equinox, that hasn't been a part of the issue,\" said Zimmerman.\n\nGM said the automaker is aware that dealers have a limited supply of parts, but \"we are supplementing customer needs with inventories from a group of more than 300 wholesale dealers and ACDelco distributors,\" said Jim Cain, GM spokesman.\n\nGM said it has also made arrangements to have many high- volume maintenance and repair service parts shipped directly from its suppliers to dealers.\n\n\"GM and our dealers are working hard to minimize any customer inconvenience due to the UAW strike and we have taken a number of steps to keep parts flowing to dealers,\" said Cain. \"If critical recall or warranty repairs are delayed because of parts availability, our dealers are pleased to offer complimentary courtesy transportation.\u201d\n\nGM strike: GM tells striking union members it will continue their health coverage\n\nIn terms of new car inventory, though, Zimmerman and Pitre say no problem. At Matick, Zimmerman's biggest sellers are the 2019 Chevrolet Equinox SUV and the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado pickup.\n\n\"Inventory, ours is pretty strong,\" said Zimmerman. \"We have over 1,100 cars on the ground and we have about 450 that are marked as in transit and most of those are still getting delivered. I haven\u2019t seen any interruption.\"\n\nBut he added: \"Right now we\u2019re in a good spot. But I hope it gets resolved quickly.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dealers and suppliers are feeling the impact of the UAW strike against GM.
