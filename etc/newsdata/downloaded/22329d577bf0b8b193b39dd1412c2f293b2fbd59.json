REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo\n\nText messages between U.S. diplomats, a whistleblower complaint and a series of public statements by Trump and other officials in recent days offer the clearest view yet of the extent to which the president has used the government to chase accusations that secret forces have been plotting against him.\n\nMuch of that evidence has surfaced because of an impeachment inquiry led by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nSome of the evidence that has emerged shows that:\n\n- State Department envoys in Europe offered Ukraine\u2019s president a White House visit if he promised to investigate a discredited theory suggesting Russia did not interfere in the 2016 election that put Trump in office. A whistleblower complaint by an intelligence officer suggested Trump also held back nearly $400 million in security aid to Ukraine as additional leverage, which Trump has denied doing.\n\n- The Justice Department is now investigating its own probe into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and allegations that Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Moscow. Attorney General William Barr and another senior department official travelled to Europe in recent months to investigate the theory that the FBI investigation, first launched during the presidential campaign in 2016, was actually a plot to stop Trump from becoming president.\n\nThe president\u2019s tendency to say untrue things, particularly on Twitter, has caused headaches for his administration before. Until now, however, the government had largely taken pains to distance itself from such statements.\n\nAs recently as last year, the Justice Department argued in a series of court cases that when it came to national security, the president did not necessarily know what he was tweeting about.\n\nHere are the three cases in which Trump has publicly advanced views of uncorroborated conspiracies behind episodes damaging his presidency. The White House declined to comment on the cases:\n\nA CROWDSTRIKE CONSPIRACY\n\nInvestigations by U.S. intelligence, law enforcement, Congress and outside researchers have all concluded that Russia\u2019s government was to blame for hacking Democratic Party organizations and leaking stolen emails at politically opportune moments in 2016. Russia has denied involvement, although U.S. investigators even named the Russian officers who were sitting at the keyboard during the breaches.\n\nBut another view has taken hold in on some right-wing websites. In that telling, the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which the DNC hired to investigate the hack, falsely accused Russia, and spirited the hacked email servers to Ukraine as part of a cover-up. As early as March 2017, an unnamed poster on the fringe website 4chan wrote that \u201cRussia could not have been the source of leaked Democrat emails released by WikiLeaks.\u201d Other posts incorrectly said CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is Ukrainian (he is a U.S. citizen born in Russia).\n\nTrump referenced that view during a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, mentioning CrowdStrike by name, and saying \u201cThe server they say Ukraine has it.\u201d Ahead of that call the U.S. special representative to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, suggested in a text message to a Zelenskiy aide that Zelenskiy might score a White House visit if he promised to \u201cget to the bottom of what happened\u201d in 2016, a reference to the election meddling.\n\nCrowdStrike said in a blog post that its finding of Russian involvement was supported by U.S. intelligence and that it never took possession of the hacked servers.\n\nTrump\u2019s former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, said officials in the administration tried to dissuade Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a conspiracy theory. It is completely debunked,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week With George Stephanopoulos\u201d last month.\n\nA MALTESE PROFESSOR\n\nRussian involvement in the 2016 election produced an investigation like few others in U.S. history, focused on whether Trump\u2019s campaign had colluded with the Kremlin to win.\n\nAnother theory, endorsed by Trump, holds that the probe was actually an elaborate effort by U.S. officials and foreign spies to deny him the presidency.\n\nThe FBI opened its Russia probe in 2016, after an Australian diplomat reported that a Trump campaign aide named George Papadopoulos had boasted that Russia had obtained email \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, weeks before the hack of the Democratic National Committee became public. Papadopoulos told the FBI that he learned that from a Maltese academic, Joseph Mifsud.\n\nPapadopoulos has alleged that Mifsud was actually a Western intelligence operative trying to frame him, and by extension, Trump. On Twitter, Trump has hinted at that theory, repeating messages asking why Mifsud was not charged with a crime, and quoting a television interview in which Papadopoulos said the \u201cwhole thing was a complete setup.\u201d\n\nNow Barr is investigating how the government opened an investigation - which went on to be led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller - that the president dismissed as a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d from the start. Barr told CBS News that official explanations for the FBI\u2019s investigation \u201cdon\u2019t hang together.\u201d He has not elaborated on what he is investigating or why, but told a Senate subcommittee this year that \u201cthere is a basis for my concern.\u201d\n\nBarr travelled to Italy seeking information about Mifsud, and to the United Kingdom to meet with its intelligence officials. He has tapped the lead federal prosecutor in Connecticut to lead the review.\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGATIONS\n\nTrump\u2019s efforts to pursue those conspiracies came to light in large part because an unnamed U.S. intelligence officer filed a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelenskiy.\n\nTrump has accused Democrats of secretly ghostwriting the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. He described the whistleblower\u2019s sources as \u201cspying on our own president,\u201d and said they deserve \u201cBig Consequences.\u201d\n\nHe also said on Wednesday that the Intelligence Committee Inspector General, who first reviewed the complaint and determined that it was credible and urgent, had presided over a \u201cscam.\u201d\n\nTrump also said his administration was \u201ctrying to find out\u201d the whistleblower\u2019s identity, and that he wanted to question his unnamed accuser.\n\nWhen the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers said a second official had also spoken to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, Trump said that person too was \u201ccoming in from the Deep State,\u201d a phrase that commonly refers to an alleged secret cabal within the U.S. government.\n\nOne of the initial whistleblower\u2019s lawyers, Mark Zaid, has said that Congress did not help the whistleblower prepare the nine-page set of allegations that touched off the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nNonetheless, Trump\u2019s allies in the House and his lawyers have taken up the accusation that the whistleblower worked in secret with the Democratic head of the House committee leading the impeachment inquiry, Adam Schiff.\n\nIn a letter Tuesday, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone cited this among the president\u2019s reasons for refusing to cooperate with the impeachment probe. The whistleblower\u2019s party leanings and his contact with Democrats \u201craises serious questions that must be investigated,\u201d he wrote.", "description": "President Donald Trump has enlisted parts of the U.S. government and key allies in the pursuit of unproven or disproven conspiracy theories, some incubated in the dark and anonymous corners of the internet.", "authors": ["Brad Heath", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439490911&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9920U", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
