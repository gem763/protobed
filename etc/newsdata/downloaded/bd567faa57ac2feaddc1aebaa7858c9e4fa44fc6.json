Satish. Photos of the students in cardboard boxes began circulating on social media. That was reportedly spotted by the state's deputy director for the department of pre-university education, S.C. Peerzade, who then halted the experiment.\n\nPeerzade told The Hindu: \"When I went to the college, most of the students had cartons over their heads. I sought an explanation from the administrator,\" he said. Peerzade added that the administrator had been inspired by a similar experiment at another college.\n\nThe administrator later apologized.\n\nSatish told the BBC on Saturday that the college had sought students' consent. \"There was no compulsion of any kind,\" he said. \"You can see in the photograph that some students were not wearing it. Some who wore it removed it after 15 minutes, some after 20 minutes and we ourselves asked them to remove it after one hour.\"", "description": "", "authors": ["Shona Ghosh"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dac2080cc4a0a579d5ef866?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
