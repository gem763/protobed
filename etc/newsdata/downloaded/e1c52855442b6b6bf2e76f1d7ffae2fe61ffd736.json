Leonard averaged 6.7 potential assists (passes that led to a shot that a teammate missed) last year, according to the NBA's stats site. He's averaging 11.0 potential assists to begin this year.\n\nIt's not that Leonard is an unwilling passer, but clearly, he has taken on a new role early with this Clippers team.\n\nMeet \"Point Kawhi\"\n\nIn two games, Leonard has acted as a pick-and-roll ball-handler on 50% of possessions, up from 26.8% last year.\n\nLeonard has already shown great chemistry with the Clippers bigs in the pick-and-roll, particularly with Montrezl Harrell.\n\nLeonard has always been capable of drawing the defense and finding the open man, but this year, he's shown an almost LeBron James-esque ability to draw a second defender, then sling the ball cross-court to a shooter.\n\nThe NBA world has taken notice of Leonard's improved playmaking.\n\nThe Clippers, despite owning perhaps the best, most well-rounded roster in the NBA, entered the season with some questions at point guard. Patrick Beverley, nominally a point guard, can handle the ball but doesn't create many plays for others. Lou Williams is an excellent ball-handler but primarily looks to score. He can create plays in a pick-and-roll but isn't the type to organize and set up an offense.\n\nA source with knowledge of the Clippers' thinking said in the offseason that the team was not worried about any holes at point guard. This source believed the Clippers had enough to get by and would not miss having a \"true point guard\" on the roster.\n\nIt appears having Leonard run more plays was in the game plan all along. Paul George, an underrated playmaker, will get turns when he is healthy, too. George is expected to return in November as he recovers from offseason shoulder surgery.\n\nTwo games is a very small sample size in an 82-game season. Yet to kick off the year, the Clippers look like everything the NBA world expected and more. The Clippers will only present more of a problem if their star players continue to add to their games, as Leonard has shown.", "description": "Kawhi Leonard's playmaking has made a leap with the Clippers this season, making the title favorites look even scarier.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db3162cdee0193668644586?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
