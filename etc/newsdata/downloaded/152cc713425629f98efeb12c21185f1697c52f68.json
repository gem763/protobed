Even today, she strives to understand not just valuation, but how businesses really work.\n\nQiao Ma will always back a founder-led business, as long as it's the right founder. Arsineh Houspian\n\n\"Nowadays the business school kids will all have, say, Excel spreadsheets to price options. But back then when I was at the University of Virginia, third-year college students had to derive Black Scholes by hand. We actually had to spend months understanding the mathematical theory behind it.\" (At Harvard Business School, one of her professors was Robert Merton, of the Black-Scholes-Merton model.)\n\nQiao is a portfolio manager at Cooper Investors' Asian equities fund. She reckons the best companies in Asia are five years ahead of the rest of the world.\n\n\"There are 6000 companies in Asia that I can invest in; I pick 40. So the bar is really high. We're talking about the 40 most ethical, capable founders.\"\n\nSome 80 per cent of the portfolio and watch list stocks are in four broad verticals: consumer, technology, health care and select financial services.\n\nThree weeks ago, she visited Huazhu Group in Shanghai. As the hotel industry is experiencing a cyclical downturn, Qiao asked what the company is doing to reduce expenses. The CEO replied that he was accelerating his expansion. \"They're opening hotels at a pace of three times what they're doing two years ago, and I said, 'why are you doing that?'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a downturn, Huazhu's competitive advantage versus independent hotels widens dramatically. It's a franchised hotel group and acting counter-cyclically enables it to cherry-pick the best properties.\n\n\"How difficult would it be to make this counter-cyclical decision if you have a 12-person board?\"\n\nFollow the founder\n\nThere's another reason she advocates for founder-led companies: in China, the competition tends to be composed of state-owned enterprises, where the head of the business is preoccupied with his political career more than commercial success, or mediocre salaried management.\n\nFounder-leaders \"have both the will and the ownership of the company to make swift changes\".\n\nQiao also owns WeChat's parent Tencent, whose founder Pony Ma she credits for the company's discipline and innovation.\n\n\"Whenever there's a big trend happening in China internet, Tencent's never the first with the trend. They always sit back, wait, and they're the second or third and somehow three years later when you look back, they've run away with 60 per cent of the market.\"\n\nBut understanding Tencent requires an investor to back its founder. \"Tencent has always been a company about optionality. If you take Tencent and start valuing the business as it is you will always miss out on Tencent,\" she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There are a couple of interesting trends happening in China, one is live broadcasting \u2013 and this is people holding up a phone and taking a video of what they're doing \u2013- and short videos, these 30- to 60-second videos. There are very big start-ups in each one of these newer verticals and people are saying, 'well, they're encroaching into Tencent's territory'.\n\n\"I belong to the camp of: `Give them a few years'.\"\n\nQiao experienced one of her biggest investment lessons in her previous career as a hedge fund manager in New York. She has worked at Jericho Capital and Coatue Management, a technology-focused firm founded by Philippe Laffont (who is ex-Tiger Management).\n\nShort lesson\n\n\"At some point, I held a short position in an American gaming company called Electronic Arts. We shorted the stock \u2013 this is painful to talk about even today \u2013 we shorted the stock at about $US20 and the thesis was the world was moving to mobile gaming, therefore the developers for the console gaming would lose relevance. Sounds smart?\n\n\"I would say some of the most dangerous mistakes that an investor can make all sound smart. The stock reported, and I remember management came out and announced the digital initiatives, the free-to-download games, and you have a lights-on moment when you realise not only is this not a company losing relevance, they're actually making their intellectual property so much more valuable.\"\n\nShe covered her short, at a loss, and the stock has tripled since then. The lesson was underestimating the determination of EA's management. \"Now I do not invest in a company until we meet the key decision-maker. Until that moment, it's all theory.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis necessitates 500 meetings in the region a year between her and her team.\n\nQiao initially worked in investment banking, joining Lehman Brothers in 2006-07. Aside from Wall Street's 24/7 culture, \"that whole episode really taught a lot of humility into every ex-Lehman person,\" she says. \"Any one of us could have run Lehman through our own models and realised immediately what the problem was, but we didn't.\"\n\n(Showing an early sell discipline, she sold her stock to pay for business school tuition a few months before the bankruptcy.)\n\nAfter leaving New York and settling in Melbourne, she was dissatisfied with the recruitment firm meant to help her find a job, so Qiao called her investor relations contacts in Asia and asked them to review their logs for Melbourne-based investment managers. That's how she ended up at Peter Cooper's $10 billion firm.\n\n\"We talk about value latency, not so much on valuation, which is a pure P/E capture. On value latency, the whole philosophy behind it is when you're backing the right team, the right founder, the right culture, there is a lot of optionality that comes out of just their endeavours. Maybe you don't see it today.\"\n\nBest of both worlds\n\nIt could be true of an Australian company, it could be Tencent or another one of her portfolio positions which is LVMH. The storied founder-led fashion group now earns 60 per cent of its growth from Asian shoppers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLVMH is, she says, the best of both worlds. The group can add brands, but retain the artistry of a house while escalating its efficiency. The consumer almost never knows.\n\n\"Celine is another [LVMH brand] that's been doing really well, and Dior. They have this unique style, they keep the touch and feel of the product intact \u2013 it's a completely original Dior feel \u2013 but the back-end: the digital, customer base, the operations, the procurement, the marketing campaign, everything is actually being managed in a very professional way.\"\n\nA newer idea is Huya, which is the equivalent of Amazon's gaming streaming platform Twitch. Huya and its rival DouYu now have a roughly equal market share after the industry over-capitalised at great expense.\n\nAs the race to secure gaming talent intensified, well-funded start-ups were paying out 70 per cent of total revenue in the form of revenue share to lure talent.\n\n\"Now the market has consolidated into two platforms,\" Qiao explains. Tencent has a stake in Huya, which itself was a spin-off of YY, a company she has followed for 10 years.\n\n\"I like companies that are in the ecosystem that we know,\" she says. \"Tencent has oversight on a lot of the data that goes in and out through Huya so we know the traffic is legit and the users are real and the money is also real. I always say, `it's easy to cheat investors, it's much harder to cheat Tencent'. That's probably one of the edgier ideas that we like.\"", "description": "The Cooper portfolio manager reckons Asia's best businesses are five years ahead of the rest of the world, and she's backing the Asian equivalent of Twitch, Huya.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2676%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_48%2C$y_267/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1ea51bfb594402b85a519b8ca57d88a1720a26df", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
