I don\u2019t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke. So many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, it can be a lot of negative that comes with it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 LeBron James believes Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey \"was either misinformed or not really educated on the situation\" and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/14/720c3b_china-nba-19902-los-angeles-lakers-lebron-james-in-action-brooklyn-nets-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
