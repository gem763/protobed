It's not my opinion. I was nowhere in the picture during all these days.\n\n\"My first selection committee meeting will be on the 24th. The coach will be there, but not the captain.\n\n\"What matters is what Dhoni wants. Maybe, there is clarity between Dhoni and the selectors, but I do not know of it as yet.\n\n\"Neither side has discussed anything with me. They'll decide on the way forward.\"\n\nWhen asked if he will speak to Dhoni, Ganguly said he might if he needs to. \"What he [Dhoni] wants to do, what he doesn't [want] to do.\"", "description": "New BCCI president Sourav Ganguly said he will need to meet with the national selectors to find out if MS Dhoni will be selected for India again.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1724/c1c5b79439c846e3af7410aa3592a365.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
