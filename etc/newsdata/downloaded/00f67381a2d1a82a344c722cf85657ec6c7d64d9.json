He funded and oversaw the Internet Research Agency, based in St. Petersburg, that inundated Facebook, Twitter and other social media with messages designed to help elect President Trump, discourage African Americans from voting and inflame U.S. political discourse, authorities have said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe African operations showed some similarities to that effort, including the willingness to promote messages on both sides of a political debate, but it also showed new tactics, such as the involvement of local partners in the Russian effort, said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy. He said that gives authorities at the national level more opportunities to detect and potentially shut down operations while also increasing the complexity for the Russians in building and maintaining their disinformation networks.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen Russian actors franchising their operations over to Africans \u2026 to amplify their messages,\u201d Gleicher said.\n\nHe added, \u201cPart of what we\u2019re seeing is these threat actors trying to evolve \u2026 but we\u2019re evolving a bit faster, and we\u2019re getting better at detecting them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFacebook\u2019s announcement underscored the increasingly global nature of disinformation campaigns and the extent to which Russian operatives have not been chastened by the U.S. response to the 2016 interference campaign.\n\nRather, the Russians appear to be advancing their tactics and relying on new means of deception, such as using messaging groups, including Facebook-owned WhatsApp, to deliver disinformation. The targets, according to Facebook, were in Madagascar, the Central African Republic, Mozambique, Congo, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Sudan and Libya.\n\nThe announcement also highlighted how disinformation is being carried out by quasi-private groups with shadowy links to nation-state actors. In this case, researchers said, the activity bore links to the Wagner Group, which experts have tied to Prigozhin. The Wagner Group has been characterized as a \u201csemi-state\u201d security organization. The rise of these opaque entities has accompanied Russia\u2019s effort to assert itself on the international stage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPrigozhin was indicted in 2018 by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who reported that the Internet Research Agency had an extensive network of paid human operatives, often called trolls, with ambitions to influence politics in many nations through social media. Efforts to reach Prigozhin through a Washington attorney representing his catering business were not successful.\n\nThe closing of the Russian-linked accounts \u2014 coming a week after Facebook also closed Instagram accounts targeting Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden \u2014 shows how the company is moving forcefully against foreign sources of disinformation at a time when some critics say it is not doing enough to curb domestic sources. The company has faced particularly withering attacks for a policy, announced last month, allowing U.S. politicians to lie on its platforms without consequence.\n\nAssisting Facebook in its investigation of the Russian disinformation networks were researchers from the Stanford Internet Observatory, headed by former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Stanford researchers said the disinformation network targeting Libyans appeared to be tied to Prigozhin and the Wagner Group. A key piece of evidence was communications about the effort originally collected by the Dossier Center, a project tracking Russian criminal activity that was founded by exiled business executive Mikhail Khodorkovsky.\n\nStanford researcher Shelby Grossman said the African disinformation operations that Facebook shut down resembled those of the Internet Research Agency in targeting U.S. audiences before and after the 2016 campaign. The messages were highly visual and shrewdly targeted, displaying a facility with issues designed to resonate locally.\n\nBut the tactics also showed evolution and a willingness to experiment with new methods for delivering messages and evading detection.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re definitely trying out more things,\u201d Grossman said.\n\nOne novel tactic, used in a page supporting Mozambique\u2019s ruling party, was a seemingly benign online contest asking Facebook users to post images of themselves doing good deeds, presumably to increase engagement with the page. \u201cThe photo that has the most likes and reposts will be painted on a canvas by a plastic artist, as a gift, and published on our page,\u201d said the post, written in Portuguese.\n\nMore familiar Russian disinformation tactics included the spreading of false and misleading reports, in some cases from accounts purporting to represent news organizations.\n\nOne Facebook page targeting Sudan, called Radio Africa, ran a post showing a picture of Putin below text reading, \u201cAmerican and British intelligence put together false information about Putin\u2019s inner circle. \u2026 A diplomatic military source said that American and British intelligence agencies are preparing to leak false information about people close to the president, Vladimir Putin, and the leadership of the Russian defense ministry.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe disinformation campaign in Sudan reposted stories from the Russian government\u2019s news outlet Sputnik. The one in Libya in some cases supported aspiring politicians, including the son of late Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi, who was deposed and killed in 2011.\n\nKimberly Marten, chair of the political science department at Barnard College and an expert on international security, cautioned against seeing the operations in Africa as pilot projects for interference in Western democracies. The best evidence dates the Wagner Group\u2019s presence on the continent to 2018, she said, meaning that its online activities may be inspired by Russia\u2019s success in interfering in U.S. and European elections, rather than jumping-off points for operations elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at what Prigozhin is doing \u2014 and presumably he\u2019s doing it under Putin\u2019s guidance \u2014 he\u2019s throwing spaghetti against the wall and seeing what sticks,\u201d Marten said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing so much in both the U.S. and Europe that they don\u2019t need to start in Africa to have an impact there. It\u2019s more likely they\u2019re taking techniques that have worked and seeing if they work in Africa.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMarten also said social media may not be as useful as a platform for disinformation in Africa as it is in other parts of the world because of lower literacy rates. What the Wagner Group seems to be doing in Africa, the security scholar said, is cultivating \u201cpersonal relationships with leaders in a neocolonial model,\u201d propping up their political endeavors with positive stories that may then travel via the rumor mill.\n\nThe best response from the United States, she said, would be to continue with multilateral engagement and \u201cnot take part in a great power scramble for Africa.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The man behind Russia's Internet Research Agency trolls that worked to elect Donald Trump has been active in Africa, too, according to Facebook, which took down more than 170 accounts with nearly 1 million followers overall.", "authors": ["Craig Timberg", "National Reporter Covering Technology", "Isaac Stanley-Becker", "National Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oUcV7AIFnVh9FV6Gbv0ONz3Xsxw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4GY6KFXDVMI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
