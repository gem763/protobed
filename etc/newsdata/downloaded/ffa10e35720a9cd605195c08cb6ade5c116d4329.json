(Photo: Courtesy of Equinor)\n\nNearly 5.7 million litres of oil have spilled since Hurricane Dorian destroyed an oil storage facility on Grand Bahama Island last month. The worst part? Equinor, the company that owns the oil facility, still isn\u2019t done cleaning up the mess, which means the final total will be higher than it is right now.\n\nErik Haaland, a press officer with Equinor, confirmed to Earther on Monday that the Norway-based company had recovered 35,000 barrels of oil as of Sunday. That amounts to 5,678,000 litres \u2014 and the company still hasn\u2019t released a final estimate of oil lost.\n\nThe number of barrels recovered thus far is nearly three times the amount the company said it had lost a week ago. The amount of lost oil stood at 12,000 barrels, Eskil Eriksen, another company press spokesperson, told Gizmodo last week.\n\nThe Equinor South Riding Point oil facility sits on the southern coast of Grand Bahama Island near the town of High Rock. It stored 284,000,000 litres of oil, Romauld Ferreira, the Bahamas\u2019 environment and housing minister, told local news. But it remains unclear how much of that oil has been spilled into the environment.\n\nEnough has spilled to paint the on-site containers and leave a pungent smell throughout the area, according to those who have visited. And he clean-up effort has required 250 people and heavy machinery (such as vacuum trucks) on the ground.\n\nAt more than three million litres, the Grand Bahama Island spill one of the more significant single spills in recent history. To compare, the 2017 Keystone Pipeline spill in South Dakota released 1,540,000L of oil. After Hurricane Katrina struck a Chevron oil facility in 2005, some 3.7 million litres of oil were discharged. The Gulf South, of course, is home to far more fossil fuel infrastructure than the Bahamas, so Katrina wound up causing some 50 oil spills throughout the region. One spill is more than enough to cause some serious damage, though.\n\nThe Hurricane Dorian spill\u2019s impact on the Bahamas is still a giant question mark. So far, authorities have noted that some birds and a goat were \u201cimpacted,\u201d as local news reported. The facility sits along the ocean, and the company had spotted some oil offshore, though it hasn\u2019t confirmed that the oil belongs to its facility.\n\nOil is no good for marine ecosystems, especially the coral reefs that exist along the island\u2019s coast. It\u2019s no good for terrestrial ecosystems, either. Oil is toxic as hell \u2014 for plants, animals, and people.\n\nMore than a month since Hurricane Dorian pummelled the Bahamas, oil still lingers. And the Atlantic hurricane season isn\u2019t even over yet.", "description": "Nearly 5.7 million litres of oil have spilled since Hurricane Dorian destroyed an oil storage facility on Grand Bahama Island last month.
