Where it has tried them, for instance in allowing a primary-style open election of party leaders, populist forces have risen. Where Britain has not yet followed, its institutions and norms have held.\n\nRank-and-file British lawmakers, for example, still win their party\u2019s nomination by being selected rather than running in a primary. So while Mr. Johnson can become party leader by appealing to its most fervently ideological members, his own coalition can more easily ignore those voters, as they have done in halting their leader\u2019s hard-line Brexit strategy.\n\nWhen Hardball Fails\n\nLegal scholars have a phrase for moves like Mr. Johnson\u2019s attempt to suspend Parliament: constitutional hardball.\n\nHe was technically within the rules of British democracy, which allow the prime minister to \u201cprorogue\u201d Parliament, suspending it with the monarch\u2019s ascent. But he was exploiting those rules for political advantage, excluding Parliament for much of a Brexit debate that he was likely to lose. And he did so at the expense of unwritten norms, which favor involving Parliament in a decision of that magnitude.\n\nConstitutional hardball of this sort has been a hallmark of the populist era. It is encouraged by political polarization, which leads supporters of one party to see their opponents as so dangerous that stopping them is more important than safeguarding democratic norms. It is favored by populist leaders who see strong-handed rule and smashing the system as upsides in their own right.\n\nBut it can be dangerous. It forces opposition parties to either fight back in kind, risking a tit-for-tat cycle that has led democracies to erode or collapse outright, or to show restraint at the cost of accepting a potentially permanent disadvantage.", "description": "Deep into an era of tear-it-all-down populism, democratic safeguards are, for once, working as intended.", "authors": ["Max Fisher"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/world/04brexitelection-2/04brexitelection-2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
