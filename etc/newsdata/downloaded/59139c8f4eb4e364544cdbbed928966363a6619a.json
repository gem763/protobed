The UN will not publicly identify those countries, but sources told AFP the main culprits are the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Iran.\n\nIn all, 64 countries owe money to the UN. Also on the list of budget delinquents are Venezuela, North Korea, South Korea, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe last country to have paid up is war-wracked Syria, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday at his daily press conference.\n\nIn a letter sent Monday to the 37,000 employees at the UN secretariat, which was obtained by AFP, Guterres said the UN had a deficit of $230 million as of the end of September.\n\nOn Tuesday, he indicated that if the world body had not taken the initiative to cut spending since the start of the year, the hole would have been even bigger in October \u2014 possibly $600 million \u2014 and could have affected last month\u2019s General Assembly attended by world leaders.\n\n\u2013 Travel cuts \u2013\n\nIn his statement on Tuesday, Guterres thanked the 129 member states who have paid up \u201cand urged those who have not paid to do so urgently and in full.\u201d\n\nTo limit expenditures from now until year\u2019s end, the UN chief has raised the possibility of postponing conferences and meetings, limiting all but essential official travel, and reducing services.\n\nA UN official speaking on condition of anonymity said Guterres had raised the budget issues with member states as early as this past spring, asking them to pay up, but they refused.\n\nNot including what it pays for peacekeeping operations, the UN\u2019s operating budget for 2018-2019 is close to $5.4 billion, with the United States contributing 22 percent.\n\nThe portion still owed? Nearly $1.4 billion.\n\nWashington is also the largest contributor to the UN peacekeeping tab.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration has taken a hard line on UN funding, cutting contributions and pushing for cost-saving reforms.", "description": "United Nations (United States) (AFP) \u2013 The United Nations has an overall annual operating budget of several billion dollars, covering everything", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/fa1ebc_us-president-donald-trump-is-addressing-un-assembly-in-september-2019-united-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
