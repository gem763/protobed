That's after a settlement was reached Monday between members of Jefferson's family.\n\nHer father, Marquis Jefferson, obtained a restraining order Friday to prevent a funeral scheduled for Saturday afternoon, forcing its postponement.\n\nBut at a hearing Monday in Dallas, Atatiana's mother and three siblings intervened, asking Probate Court Judge Brenda Hull Thompson to dismiss the father's complaint.\n\nThe Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports that after Thompson issued a gag order, all sides negotiated for seven hours before reaching an agreement.\n\nHer funeral was initially planned for Saturday at Potter's House Church in Dallas.\n\nBut her father Marquis sought the temporary restraining order to gain control over the funeral arrangements of his daughter from her aunt, Bonita Body.\n\nMarquis argued that he had been denied any involvement in the funeral planning. He said that as his daughter's sole legal heir, the duty of arranging the funeral is his.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nHer father, Marquis Jefferson (pictured), obtained a restraining order Friday to prevent a funeral scheduled for Saturday afternoon, forcing its postponement\n\nBut at a hearing Monday in Dallas, Atatiana's mother intervened, asking Probate Court Judge Brenda Hull Thompson to dismiss the father's complaint. Atatiana Jefferson died after she was shot by Fort Worth Police Office Aaron Dean (right), who has been charged with murder\n\nLee Merritt, Body's attorney, had said on Facebook that a 'celebration of life' would proceed Saturday, but he later tweeted that the funeral had been 'postponed' and that 'updated information concerning the reschedule will be provided as soon as it becomes available'.\n\nThe Rev Al Sharpton had been set to deliver remarks at Saturday's service.\n\nThe order temporarily blocked Body and the Golden Gate funeral home 'from exercising any activities related to the wake, funeral preparations and burial'.\n\nProsecutors will seek a murder indictment from a grand jury against the Fort Worth cop who fatally struck Atatiana, who was a pre-med graduate.\n\nDean, a white police officer, shot Atatiana through the window of her bedroom in the early hours of October 12.\n\nHe resigned two days later and police charged him with murder.\n\nDean, 34, and his partner went to Atatiana's home after a concerned neighbor called police to say her front door was open.\n\nFort Worth Police Department Chief Ed Kraus said Dean was dispatched to investigate an 'open structure call,' a situation which could mean a door left open by accident or a burglary in process.\n\nAtatiana was playing video games with her eight-year-old nephew Zion when Dean arrived and crept around the back of the home, gun drawn and unannounced, according to his arrest warrant and bodycam video.\n\nThe Rev Al Sharpton had been set to deliver remarks at Saturday's service for Atatiana (pictured) before it was canceled\n\nThe victim heard noises, pulled her handgun out of her purse and pointed it at a bedroom window, Zion told police, according to the warrant.\n\nDean shined his flashlight into the window and said: 'Put your hands up, show me your hands!'\n\nHe fired a split second later, without identifying himself as police, bodycam video showed.\n\nKraus said Dean violated a series of police policies and it was understandable that Atatiana would draw her gun in such a situation.\n\n'We have completed an initial review of the case, and based on the evidence we intend to ask the Grand Jury for an indictment of murder against Aaron Dean,' Tarrant County Criminal District Attorney Sharen Wilson said in a statement.\n\n'We will prosecute this case to the fullest extent of the law.'", "description": "The funeral for Atatiana Jefferson, who was shot in her home by former Texas cop, Aaron Dean, has been rescheduled after it was postponed by her dad (right).
