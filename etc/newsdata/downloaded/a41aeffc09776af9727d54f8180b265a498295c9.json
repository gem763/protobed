I doubt it. The under-30s, maybe under-40s, are underwhelmed by Biden, even angry that this honorable man has not chosen dignified retirement. He\u2019s the emblem of the permanent political class, the one that created the conditions for Trump, in an era that Trump\u2019s wild policy lurches and heresies and, yes, lies have now transformed.\n\nAmerica\u2019s restoration, after this trauma, will not be achieved by going back. What created Trump cannot oust Trump. It will demand a new politics, and a new integrity, such as the one Warren has set out and embodied with greater vigor, persuasiveness and coherence than anyone else. Biden, on whom Trump may have been seeking dirt in a July phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, can put an end to the president\u2019s sullying of the Oval Office. He can\u2019t, however, embody renewal.\n\nIs Warren too far left to win? Maybe. Does she worry some purple-district Democrats who did well in 2018? Yes. But she can adjust. As for \u201celectability,\u201d an overused word, well, Trump won, and may again, so all bets are off.\n\nI said Biden has come close to a blowup moment. The campaign is grueling. You don\u2019t have to be almost 77 to slip up. But he has demonstrated tone-deafness on race in a way that is disturbing.\n\nHis reference to a \u201crecord player\u201d in the last Democratic debate in the context of a question about reparations for slavery tied Biden to a bygone era, but that was far from the worst of it. Talking about black families \u2014 that is what the question was about \u2014 he actually said: \u201cWe bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help. They don\u2019t, they don\u2019t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the, the \u2014 \u2014 make sure the kids hear words.\u201d\n\nThey don\u2019t know what to do! Make sure the kids hear words! This is insulting toward African-Americans. It\u2019s of a piece with Biden\u2019s comment (quickly adjusted) in August that \u201cwe have this notion that somehow if you\u2019re poor, you cannot do it. Poor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a way, and a need, to talk about fundamental systemic racial injustice, but this is emphatically not it. Black does not equal poor and inept. The genius has left a void. Right now it\u2019s not his vice president who may just fill it enough, but Warren.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
