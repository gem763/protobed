They should be sued!\u201d\n\nPrior to the publication of the editors\u2019 note, some of Kavanaugh\u2019s detractors had criticized the Times report, which is branded online as \u201cNews Analysis\u201d and first mentioned Stier\u2019s new allegation several paragraphs into the essay.\n\nOn Monday night, the president broadened his attack on The Times in back-to-back tweets.\n\n\u201cI call for the Resignation of everybody at The New York Times involved in the Kavanaugh SMEAR story, and while you\u2019re at it, the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, which is just as phony!\u201c he wrote. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken the Old Grey Lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation... She can never recover, and will never return to Greatness, under current Management. The Times is DEAD, long live The New York Times!\u201c\n\nTrump also slammed the report several times over the weekend, charging that The Times was trying to use its coverage to influence Kavanaugh\u2019s decisions from the bench.\n\n\u201cNow the Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media, are after Brett Kavanaugh again, talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment,\u201d he tweeted on Sunday. \u201cHe is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!\u201d\n\nThe president also controversially asserted that Kavanaugh \u201cshould start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh has denied all charges of sexual misconduct, and did not speak to the Times reporters because the parties could not agree on terms for an interview.", "description": "\u201cThe one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh - Assaulted by lies and Fake News!\u201d the president tweeted.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/67/df/58fff5254030b750f8786755ead0/190916-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
