Taylor Jr. , a military officer and diplomat who has served his country for 50 years . Undaunted by White House pressure, he came forward to accuse the same president who sent him to Ukraine a few months ago of abusing his power to advance his own political interests.\n\nThe House impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to force Ukraine to investigate Democrats is the climax of a 33-month scorched-earth struggle between a president with no record of public service and the government he inherited but never trusted. If Mr. Trump is impeached by the House, it will be in part because of some of the same career professionals he has derided as \u201cabsolute scum\u201d or compared to Nazis.", "description": "The impeachment inquiry is in some ways the culmination of a battle between the president and the government institutions he distrusted and disparaged.", "authors": ["Peter Baker", "Lara Jakes", "Julian E.
