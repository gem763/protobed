Mitt Romney (R-UT) has been caught using the pseudonym \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d to defend his own honor on Twitter.\n\nEverything about this story says so much about Mitt Romney: his pettiness, his insecurity, his lack of character, honesty, and decency, starting with how it all unraveled: Romney doing business with the establishment media \u2014 in this case, the far-left Atlantic and activist-reporter, McKay Coppins, who was originally hired at BuzzFeed to destroy Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign.\n\nBack in 2011, Coppins was the affirmative-action hire of all affirmative-action hires. Determined to win Barack Obama a second term, BuzzFeed knew it needed a left-wing Mormon (or a \u201cmedia-approved Mormon,\u201d as I dubbed him at the time) on the team, someone who could trash Romney without being called a religious bigot. Before the race was over, among other things, Coppins accused Romney of ginning up a \u201crace war\u201d over his welfare reform proposals.\n\nMoreover, Coppins is not terribly bright. That might seem unfair, but how else to describe a man who assured the world Evan McMullin \u201cis on the verge of beating Trump and Clinton in deep-red Utah\u201d as he\u2019s \u201cliterally building a new party.\u201d Spoiler Alert: Trump won Utah by 18 points and McMullin is now a punchline. How else to describe a man who declared in 2014: \u201cTrump very badly wants to be taken seriously as a potential political candidate and not be written off as a man-boy who cried wolf. But, at the same time, he plainly has no interest in actually running for office.\u201d Spoiler Alert: Trump is the President of the United States.\n\nAnyway, like an abused spouse, Romney continues to cuddle up to his media abusers, people who treated him much worse than Trump ever has. It\u2019s a clinical condition known as McCain Syndrome, and there\u2019s no known cure.\n\nAnd so, because there is a God and He loves us, Romney\u2019s cuddling with his abuser on the pages of the Atlantic has ended in total humiliation after he attempted to brag about his social media savvy (emphasis added):\n\nWhen I met [Romney] in his office a couple of weeks later, I asked if [Trump\u2019s] Twitter insults bothered him. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of what he does,\u201d Romney said with a shrug, and then got up to retrieve an iPad from his desk. He explained that he uses a secret Twitter account\u2014\u201cWhat do they call me, a lurker?\u201d\u2014to keep tabs on the political conversation. \u201cI won\u2019t give you the name of it,\u201d he said, but \u201cI\u2019m following 668 people.\u201d Swiping at his tablet, he recited some of the accounts he follows, including journalists, late-night comedians (\u201cWhat\u2019s his name, the big redhead from Boston?\u201d), and athletes. Trump was not among them. \u201cHe tweets so much,\u201d Romney said, comparing the president to one of his nieces who overshares on Instagram. \u201cI love her, but it\u2019s like, Ah, it\u2019s too much.\n\nExcept\u2026\n\nWe now know it is not a \u201clurker\u201d account.\n\nOh no\u2026 it is so much more than that\u2026\n\nIt took a writer at Slate about fourteen seconds to discover that Mitt Romney, a sitting United States Senator, uses the name Pierre Delecto to run all around Twitter defending\u2026 Mitt Romney.\n\nAnd Romney has already been forced to confirm that \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d is indeed a fella named Willard.\n\nFirst off, \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d sounds like \u201cCarlo Danger\u2019s\u201d serial killing partner. But whereas disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner used the pseudonym \u201cCarlos Danger\u201d to troll for underage girls, Romney uses \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d to whimper like a Fredo for a little frikkin\u2019 respect.\n\nWell, not anymore. Now that he\u2019s become the laughingstock of the Internet, Willard has locked up \u201cPierre\u201d as a private account.\n\nThankfully, though, before he ran away and hid like a girl, we were able to discover just how much Mitt Romney loves him some Mitt Romney, and when Mitt Romney doesn\u2019t get his due, Mitt Romney is there to say something about the greatness of Mitt Romney.\n\nWhen Mitt Romney discovers his numero uno shrieking fangirl is disappointed in Mitt Romney, Mitt Romney is there to stand tall for Mitt Romney:\n\nGosh darn it, Mitt Romney does too have a moral compass.\n\nMitt Romney has principles, so says Mitt Romney, and so say we all\u2026\n\n\n\nBut look at what Romney\u2019s really doing, look at how pathetic this all is\u2026\n\nHe\u2019s so insecure and hungry for approval, but so cowardly and craven in not wanting to correct or criticize his abusers in the media directly, that he cowers in their mentions under the cloak of just another anonymous nobody.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t Romney use his verified Twitter account to makes these points, to set the record straight? Why doesn\u2019t he reach out directly to those in the media when he wants something corrected?\n\nI\u2019ll tell you why\u2026 because he\u2019s a whimpering, abused little quisling of a man \u2014 so intimidated and defeated by the corrupt media that when he\u2019s not kissing abuser ass on the pages of the Atlantic, he can only try and regain some of his pride by hiding in the dark and rebelling in a way that isn\u2019t even as nervy as ringing a doorbell and running.\n\nIf that\u2019s not bad enough, Romney is using the \u201clike\u201d button on his Pierre Delecto account to file away those tweets that make Mitt Romney\u2019s heart sing: tweets accusing Trump of swindling kids with cancer, about invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office, and attacking Newt Gingrich for impeaching Bill Clinton while cheating on his own wife.\n\nWhat a catty, cowardly, neurotic, little backstabbing gerbil Mitt Romney is\u2026\n\nBut we already knew that.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
