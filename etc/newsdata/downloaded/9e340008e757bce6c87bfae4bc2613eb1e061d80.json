Brewer III, a partner at Brewer, Attorneys & Counselors and counsel for the NRA, welcomed the development.\n\n\u201cThe memo serves as a clear concession and a well-deserved win for the First and Second Amendments of the United States Constitution,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt is unfortunate that in today\u2019s polarized times, some elected officials would rather silence opposing arguments than engage in good-faith debate. The NRA \u2014 America\u2019s oldest civil rights organization \u2014 won\u2019t stand for that.\u201d\n\nJohn Cote, spokesperson for City Attorney Dennis Herrera, disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe memo is not a concession,\u201d he said, the San Francisco Examiner reported. \u201cIt just explains what has always been true \u2014 the resolution does not change the law. If the NRA thinks this is a win, it\u2019s only because their lawsuit completely distorts what the resolution actually does.\u201d\n\nThe NRA\u2019s lawsuit states that the Board of Supervisors\u2019 infringed upon constitutional rights when it \u201cunanimously adopted a new government policy: blacklist anyone linked to the NRA.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
