Eintracht Frankfurt could move level on points with their opponents if they seal victory.\n\nThe hosts seem to be adjusting to life without attackers Luka Jovic, Sebastien Haller and Ante Rebic but Bayer Leverkusen will provide a tough test.\n\nPeter Bosz's side held title hopefuls RB Leipzig to a 1-1 draw prior to the international break.\n\nIn Kevin Volland they have a man who can put the ball in the back of the net. He has scored four league goals this season.\n\nLeverkusen are the bookmakers' favourites to come away from the Commerzbank-Arena with all three points but it it likely to be a tight encounter.\n\nIn Kevin Volland Bayer Leverkusen have a man who can put the ball in the back of the net\n\nSATURDAY\n\nUnion Berlin vs Freiburg\n\n2.30pm UK time\n\nThe home side's remarkable victory over Borussia Dormund has become a distant memory.\n\nUnion Berlin have failed to build on that win at the end of August and have lost their last four games.\n\nThe newly-promoted side have not been thrashed but getting points on the board is all that matters.\n\nOpponents Freiburg have sustained their good start to the 2019-20 campaign and held Dortmund to a draw before the break for international football.\n\nChristian Streich's team currently sit in fourth place in the league table, on the same number of points as reigning champions Bayern Munich and just two points behind leaders Borussia Monchengladbach.\n\nChristian Streich's Freiburg have sustained their good start to the 2019-20 campaign\n\nAugsburg vs Bayern Munich\n\n2.30pm UK time\n\nBoth these sides were beaten a fortnight ago and so will be keen to get a positive result this weekend.\n\nAugsburg have won just one game so far this season and if they were to get anything from Saturday's match against Niko Kovac's side it will be a shock.\n\nFlorian Niederlechner, who has averaged a league goal every 154 minutes this campaign, will be looking to prove he can find the net against a top European outfit.\n\nBayern suffered a surprise home defeat by Hoffenheim on October 5 and so will be eager to put things right.\n\nAugsburg have conceded the joint-most goals (19) in the Bundesliga this season, while Bayern have scored the most (20).\n\nRobert Lewandowski has been in fine form for the champions and he also netted a hat-trick for Poland during the break.\n\nRobert Lewandowski has been in fine form for the champions and he a hat-trick for Poland\n\nFortuna Dusseldorf vs Mainz\n\n2.30pm UK time\n\nThe hosts have not been victorious since their opening-day win at Werder Bremen while their opponents Mainz overcame Paderborn in their previous outing earlier this month.\n\nFortuna Dusseldorf can take positives from their narrow defeats by Freiburg and Monchengladbach last month as well as their 1-1 draw with Wolfsburg.\n\nThe home side have no trouble in taking the lead but they have given away that advantage in their past five matches.\n\nThe visitors can take heart from their head-to-head Bundesliga record with Fortuna Dusseldorf as they have won three out of their four clashes.\n\nFortuna Dusseldorf can take positives from their narrow defeat by Freiburg last month\n\nRB Leipzig vs Wolfsburg\n\n2.30pm UK time\n\nThis is set to be an exciting tussle as joint-fourth-placed RB Leipzig take on second-placed Wolfsburg.\n\nOne of the battles to keep an eye on will be between the two strikers - Leipzig's Timo Werner and Wolfsburg's Wout Weghorst.\n\nWerner has notched five league goals while Weghorst has four Bundesliga goals to his name as well as two assists.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann's side have not won this month following a defeat by Lyon in the Champions League and a draw with Bayer Leverkusen last time out.\n\nWolfsburg can put the pressure on leaders Monchengladbach and could move to the summit of the German top flight with victory - if only for a brief spell.\n\nWolfsburg's Wout Weghorst has four Bundesliga goals to his name as well as two assists\n\nWerder Bremen vs Hertha Berlin\n\n2.30pm UK time\n\nA distinctly mid-table affair at the Weser-Stadion between two teams in contrasting moments of form.\n\nHertha have all the momentum at present having won their last three matches, against Paderborn, Cologne and Fortuna Dusseldorf, having started the campaign with just one point from a possible 12.\n\nKey to the capital club's revival has been the former Manchester City academy player Javairo Dilrosun, who has scored twice and contributed two assists from his wide station during those three wins.\n\nThe last time Hertha won four Bundesliga matches on the spin came back when Lucien Favre was their manager in November 2008 so that - and a place in the top half - is their objective this weekend.\n\nThings were looking bright for Bremen in early September when back-to-back wins over Augsburg and Union Berlin appeared to have kick-started their season.\n\nA heavy home loss to RB Leipzig has since been followed by 2-2 draws away to Dortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt, both creditable results.\n\nThey also have a great record against Hertha, unbeaten in their last 11 meetings.\n\nHertha Berlin have all the momentum at present having won their last three matches\n\nBorussia Dortmund vs Borussia Monchengladbach\n\n5.30pm UK time; Live on BT Sport 2 and BT Sport Ultimate\n\nIn what is probably the pick of the week eight fixtures, surprise leaders Monchengladbach travel to the team we all expected to be leading the way, Borussia Dortmund.\n\nIt's been a terrific start for Marco Rose's Gladbach side, who moved clear at the top of the Bundesliga for the first time in 35 years with a 5-1 trouncing of Augsburg before the international break.\n\nTheir in-form front line of Alassane Plea, Marcus Thuram and Breel Embolo will be licking their lips against a Dortmund defence that has already shipped 11 goals this season - a good few of them late on in games.\n\nThey certainly don't seem to be missing Thorgan Hazard after Eden's younger brother made the move to Dortmund for \u00a322m over the summer.\n\nOne encouraging thing for Gladbach is their away record this season - they've won at Mainz, Cologne and Hoffenheim so far - though obviously a trip to the Westfalenstadion is a different proposition.\n\nIt would be folly to write off Dortmund's title chances so soon but there are undoubtedly psychological issues in the way they've repeatedly thrown away leads this season.\n\nTheir makeshift defence will certainly be tested on Saturday but, as we know, Dortmund can also be truly terrifying when their front line gets totally in sync.\n\nEden Hazard's younger brother Thorgan made the move to Borussia Dortmund for \u00a322million\n\nSUNDAY\n\nCologne vs Paderborn\n\n2.30pm UK time; Live on BT Sport 2\n\nThere's bound to be more than a whiff of panic in the air at the RheinEnergieSTADION as the Bundesliga's bottom two clubs meet on Sunday afternoon.\n\nCologne will be hoping their last-minute equaliser from Jonas Hector to earn a 1-1 draw at Schalke two weeks ago can provide them with a tiny bit of momentum.\n\nThat decent point followed demoralising 4-0 losses to Bayern Munich and Hertha Berlin, so there are certainly signs of spirit and character there.\n\nA series of winnable fixtures - first winless Paderborn and then other strugglers such as Mainz, Dusseldorf and Hoffenheim - offer the chance to get things back on track.\n\nPaderborn remain the only side not to have recorded a win so far this season and Steffen Baumgart's side, promoted last season, are finding the step up to the top tier exceedingly tough going.\n\nWeirdly, they seem to start games strongly - scoring a league-high five goals in the opening 15 minutes of games - only to then collapse.\n\nNewly-promoted Paderborn are finding the step up to the top tier exceedingly tough going\n\nHoffenheim vs Schalke 04\n\n5pm UK time; Live on BT Sport 2\n\nSargis Adamyan wrote his name into Hoffenheim history with two goals to earn their first-ever win over Bayern at the Allianz Arena before an international break that was ill-timed for them.\n\nThey seemed to catch a Bayern side still sky-high after their 7-2 drubbing of Tottenham in the Champions League on the hop.\n\nHaving gone four winless before that unexpected result, Hoffenheim will hope to pick up again with victory over resurgent Schalke.\n\nNew coach David Wagner has served as a breath of fresh air around the place and only a late Cologne equaliser last time out denied them a fifth consecutive win.\n\nTheir form saw Suat Serdar rewarded with his Germany debut in their friendly match against Argentina during the recent internationals.\n\nSchalke do have a poor record in Sinsheim - winning just once in their last 11 visits - but will start as favourites on Sunday.", "description": "Eden Hazard's younger brother Thorgan, who made the move to Borussia Dortmund for \u00a322million from Monchengladbach over the summer, is set to face his former side.", "authors": ["Kate Mcgreavy", "Adam Shergold For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/11/19879540-0-image-a-47_1571394159956.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
