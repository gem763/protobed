Sanders has held an average 5-point lead this year in the national polls, which is near his 6-point August edge. Warren\u2019s lead against Trump in the average national poll this year has been 2 points, similar to her 3-point August lead. Harris\u2019 edge has been 1 point in the average poll this year, which is nearly identical to her 2-point August advantage.\n\nAnd despite leaving the sidelines and reentering the political fray (often a bad thing for one\u2019s popularity), Biden\u2019s numbers are as good against Trump as they have been all year. Biden\u2019s current 10-point advantage over Trump is better than his average 8-point advantage this year and 8-point advantage in the polls taken this year before he declared his candidacy.\n\nBiden\u2019s numbers are holding up significantly better than Hillary Clinton\u2019s did four years ago. Like Biden, Clinton was a former member of Barack Obama\u2019s administration who decided to come out of civilian life to run for president. And like Biden, Clinton declared her candidacy in the April before the primary season.", "description": "", "authors": ["Harry Enten", "Cnn.Com Politics Joe-Biden-Wisconsin-Poll-Of-The-Week Index.Html"], "top_image": ""}
