Salazar, former coach to British runner Mo Farah, has been banned for four years\n\nPressure has also mounted on Black after British athletes failed to achieve their medal target\n\nBy giving Farah the green light to continue working with Salazar four years ago, despite a hugely damning Panorama documentary into the practises of the Nike Oregon Project, major questions have been asked of the judgement of both UKA and Black, who previously labelled Salazar a 'genius'.\n\nA bare 44-word statement from UKA to confirm Black's departure offered little detail, though it said Black would still work with Farah at the Chicago Marathon this weekend.\n\nIt read: 'UK Athletics have announced that Neil Black will leave his role as performance director at the end of October.\n\n'Neil will commence a detailed handover with performance staff until his departure and will fulfil his role supporting Mo Farah at this weekend's Chicago marathon.'\n\nThe decision, which came just 24 hours after Black's return from Doha, brings to an end Black's seven-year tenure. It is not yet clear how Barry Fudge, the head of endurance, who also had close links to Salazar, will fare in a UKA review into the US Anti-Doping Agency's findings on Salazar. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of Black, Fudge or Farah.\n\nBlack's departure comes just nine months before the Tokyo Olympics. Early figures with backing from different corners of the British athletics community include Stephen Maguire, the director of performance at Scottish Athletics, who stands as the early favourite.\n\nSalazar, who coached Farah between 2011 and 2017, was banned for four years last week\n\nOther names in the frame are Simon Nathan, who does the same role at Athletics Canada, as well as Jessica Ennis-Hill's former coach Toni Minichiello and Tommy Yule, who has admirers from his work in weightlifting. Steve Paulding, the director of the National Performance Institute at Loughborough, would also be popular with some.\n\nBlack will leave a mixed legacy having had serious detractors, particularly in the coaching community. The trained physio was seen as having favoured medals over a strong coaching infrastructure and a reliable platform for future growth. Athletes have also privately complained about elements of the medical set-up and certain funding decisions. While the latter is often a hostage to fortune, it was glaring in Doha that the best performing male sprinter, Adam Gemili, was not on individual funding.\n\nOther issues have been harder to understand, such as the logistics muddle that saw Nick Miller forced to train in Turkey rather than the Dubai holding camp because it lacked hammer facilities, as revealed by Sportsmail. The recent farce of a shot putter being accidentally named to run in the 4x400m relay at the European Team Championships also lent a touch of farce, while Black's rejection of IAAF invites for some athletes to the World Championship went down badly.\n\nUltimately, though, the position over Salazar made his position look untenable. By missing the medal target in Doha. Black evidently had nowhere to go but out.", "description": "Neil Black will leave his role as UK Athletics' performance director at the end of this month after being heavily criticised for backing Alberto Salazar.
