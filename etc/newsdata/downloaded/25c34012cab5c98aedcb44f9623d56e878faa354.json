The Governor\u2019s proposed 2020 budget recommendation will include a pay raise for more than 101,000 teachers in Florida by raising the minimum salary to $47,500.\n\nAccording to the National Education Association, Florida ranks 26th in the nation for starting teacher pay at $37,636. With this investment of over $600 million, raising the minimum salary to $47,500 will rank Florida 2nd in the nation for starting teacher pay.\n\n\u201cWe are experiencing a teacher shortage in Florida,\u201d said Governor DeSantis. \u201cWith a strong economy and plenty of jobs available in other fields, unfortunately too many college graduates are unwilling to enter the teaching profession. My proposal to increase the minimum salary for teachers to $47,500 will help alleviate this shortage and elevate the teaching profession to the level of appreciation it deserves. This is long overdue, and I look forward to working with the legislature to make this a reality.\u201d\n\nPhoto Credit: Governor\u2019s Press Office\n\n\u201cGetting a great teacher in front of every child is the number one proven way to get great outcomes for students,\u201d said Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran. \u201cToday, Governor Ron DeSantis is elevating Florida\u2019s teachers like never before and is making a statement nationally that Florida is the Education State and he is the Education Governor. Florida going from number 26 to number 2 in the nation in starting pay sends a clear signal to Florida\u2019s teachers and our entire education family that we are ready to celebrate our teachers and foster lifelong success for our students.\u201d\n\nGovernor DeSantis announced his proposal during a visit to Middleburg High School in Clay County, where he was joined by Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran and Senate Appropriations Chairman Rob Bradley. This afternoon, he will visit Bayview Elementary School in Broward County and Dunedin High School in Pinellas County.\n\nTeachers have made an incredibly positive impact on my life and the lives of my wife and kids,\u201d said Senator Rob Bradley. \u201cThis session, it\u2019s time to say thank you both in word and in deed. I\u2019m proud to stand with Governor Ron DeSantis as we fight for higher pay for Florida teachers.\u201d\n\nEducation has been a top priority of Governor DeSantis\u2019 administration. During the 2019 Legislative Session, the Governor worked with the Florida Legislature to secure historic achievements for Florida\u2019s students and families, including:\n\nThe highest ever per pupil spending at $7,672 per student.\n\nThe Creation of the Family Empowerment Scholarship Program, which expands education opportunities for children of families with limited financial resources.\n\nContinued legislative and funding support for the Schools of Hope Program and expanded the locations where the Schools of Hope Program can operate.\n\n$10 million in funding dedicated to career and technical education for the newly created Florida Pathways to Career Opportunities Grand Program.\n\nFunding for students on the waiting list for the Gardiner Scholarship and cleared the waitlist for the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship.\n\n$10 million to fund teacher professional development in computer science and reward those teachers for earning credentials to teach high quality computer science courses.\n\n###", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/State-Seal-full-color1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
