(TSE:CAE) Might Not Be A Great Investment", "language": "en", "text": "Today we'll look at CAE Inc. (TSE:CAE) and reflect on its potential as an investment. Specifically, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), since that will give us an insight into how efficiently the business can generate profits from the capital it requires.\n\nFirst up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. Finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities affect its ROCE.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?\n\nROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Generally speaking a higher ROCE is better. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?\n\nAnalysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\nOr for CAE:\n\n0.077 = CA$436m \u00f7 (CA$7.4b - CA$1.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)\n\nSo, CAE has an ROCE of 7.7%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for CAE\n\nDoes CAE Have A Good ROCE?\n\nROCE can be useful when making comparisons, such as between similar companies. Using our data, CAE's ROCE appears to be significantly below the 10% average in the Aerospace & Defense industry. This could be seen as a negative, as it suggests some competitors may be employing their capital more efficiently. Setting aside the industry comparison for now, CAE's ROCE is mediocre in absolute terms, considering the risk of investing in stocks versus the safety of a bank account.

ROCE can be misleading for companies in cyclical industries, with returns looking impressive during the boom times, but very weak during the busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nCAE's Current Liabilities And Their Impact On Its ROCE\n\nCurrent liabilities include invoices, such as supplier payments, short-term debt, or a tax bill, that need to be paid within 12 months. The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.\n\nCAE has total liabilities of CA$1.8b and total assets of CA$7.4b. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 24% of its total assets. This is a modest level of current liabilities, which would only have a small effect on ROCE.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From CAE's ROCE\n\nThat said, CAE's ROCE is mediocre, there may be more attractive investments around. Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than CAE.
