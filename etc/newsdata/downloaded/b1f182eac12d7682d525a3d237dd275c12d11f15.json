[Trump talks,] and the foreign leader is just a prop, who basically watches and tries to keep a straight face,\u201d Jussi Hanhimaki, a Finnish researcher focusing on transatlantic relations, told The Washington Post.\n\nDuring the combative news conference Wednesday, Trump lashed out at the media, accusing journalists of undermining U.S. democracy and being \u201ccorrupt people.\u201d Responding to questions about a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president that is at the center of an impeachment inquiry, Trump told a reporter: \u201cIt\u2019s a whole hoax, and you know who\u2019s playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country.\u201d\n\n[Trump rides a roller coaster of grievances, victimhood and braggadocio as Finland\u2019s leader looks on]\n\nMeanwhile, Niinisto largely looked on in silence. Photos of his bewildered face quickly circulated online. But when Trump began responding to a question addressed to Niinisto, the Finnish leader interrupted: \u201cI think the question is for me.\u201d\n\nIn what Finnish commentators suggested was a subtle dig at Trump, Niinisto at one point also said: \u201cMr. President, you have here a great democracy. Keep it going on.\u201d (Trump appeared to interpret that remark as praise.)\n\nBut to Finnish observers, Hanhimaki said, it was as far as any leader would \u201cgo in terms of implying something about the U.S. president.\u201d\n\nMikko Saikku, a professor of American studies at the University of Helsinki, said that Niinisto is known for such ambiguous statements and that it is not unusual for him to keep his cool in an uncomfortable setting.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t an easy place for him, with Trump raging about the investigation and impeachment and all that,\u201d Saikku said. \u201cHe was able to handle that quite well, and he was able to sweep in some of his trademark remarks.\u201d\n\nLaura Saarikoski, managing editor of Finland\u2019s leading daily newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, said, \u201cQuite a few people couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for Niinisto when he had to sit there and try not to look too awkward.\u201d\n\nAt one point, as the two sat together in the Oval Office, Trump leaned over and slapped Niinisto\u2019s knee. Niinisto responded by raising his hand in a move that was widely interpreted as him brushing Trump away.\n\nIt seemed as though Niinisto \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be seen as being on the same side or joining what Trump was saying,\u201d Saarikoski said. \"He didn\u2019t want to be impolite but didn\u2019t want Trump to hold his knee.\u201d\n\nSaarikoski, who was previously a U.S.-based correspondent for her newspaper and co-authored a book about Trump, said that even if Finns spent Thursday joking about it, there are \u201cserious undertones\u201d to his rhetoric.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a tactic from Trump that he always goes on these rages when he has a foreign head of state next to him,\u201d she said.\n\nIf Trump wants to address domestic concerns with American reporters, she said, \u201che could just hold a news conference and let out fumes while there with the U.S. press.\u201d\n\nFinnish observers also took issue with Trump\u2019s treatment of the media.\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump shouted less, reporters might hear better,\u201d the Helsingin Sanomat commented, in a reference to the president\u2019s frequent criticism of media outlets for allegedly misquoting him.\n\nThe Aamulehti paper reminded its readers that a \u201cclash between Niinisto and the media,\u201d akin to Trump\u2019s confrontations with journalists, \u201cseems like a very distant, almost impossible thought,\u201d given Finland\u2019s high level of press freedom.\n\nThe Ilta-Sanomat tabloid described Trump\u2019s performance as \u201cperplexing.\u201d Meanwhile, a body language expert interviewed by the paper to decipher the tumultuous news conference described Niinisto as \u201crelaxed compared to Trump,\u201d as he was listening to what the Iltalehti tabloid described as \u201cTrump\u2019s quirky monologue\u201d in the Oval Office, before the news conference.\n\nOther Finnish papers similarly applauded the Finnish president for handling his \u201crole of a bystander with honor,\u201d as Helsingin Sanomat wrote.\n\nBesides the possibility of getting drawn into the domestic U.S. debate over an impeachment inquiry, Niinisto faced the risk of triggering Trump\u2019s anger over trade ties between the United States and the European Union. Niinisto\u2019s visit to the White House on Wednesday coincided with a ruling by the World Trade Organization that Trump can impose tariffs on about $7.5 billion worth of European goods because the European Union was found to have illegally subsidized aircraft manufacturer Airbus in the past. The ruling played into Trump\u2019s narrative that Europe\u2019s trade policies disadvantage U.S. companies.\n\n\u201cNiinisto suddenly had to become the defender of the European Union, even though he was not expecting to be in that position,\u201d Hanhimaki said.\n\nWhile Trump did reiterate that \u201ccountries were ripping off the United States for many years,\u201d his continuous attacks on Europe over trade policies largely went unnoticed amid his diatribes against the media and his opponents.\n\nAnd there have been awkward moments between Trump and Niinisto before. In a 2017 joint news conference at the White House, Niinisto called on a Finnish journalist to offer her the chance to ask a question. Trump replied by suggesting that the Finnish leader was offering the same reporter a second chance at a question. \"Again?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give her \u2014 the same one?\u201d\n\nNiinisto gently clarified that this was a different woman than the one he had called on before. \u201cWe have a lot of blond women in Finland,\u201d the reporter quipped with a smile.\n\nThis time, Trump wrapped up the news conference by calling it \u201can honor\u201d to be with Niinisto.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a fantastic job. Very popular, beloved over in Finland,\" he said.\n\nAnd perhaps especially so after Wednesday, Finnish commentators suggested.\n\n\u201cNiinisto is pretty popular, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever looked quite as good as compared to Trump last night,\u201d Saarikoski said.\n\nAnd the Finnish leader himself suggested he enjoyed his stay in Washington, tweeting Thursday that in addition to meetings with Trump and Pence and a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, he visited three museums and roller-skated twice. Plus, the Washington Nationals baseball team won while he was in town.\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThanks Washington!\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump rides a roller coaster of grievances, victimhood and braggadocio as Finland\u2019s leader looks on\n\nOdd markings, ellipses fuel doubts about the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call\n\nTrump involved Pence in efforts to pressure Ukraine\u2019s leader, though officials say vice president was unaware of allegations in whistleblower complaint", "description": "Finnish newspapers applauded the country's president for handling his \u201crole of a bystander with honor.\u201d", "authors": ["Rick Noack", "Foreign Affairs Reporter Focusing On Europe", "International Security", "Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady", "Staff Writer", "Foreign Desk", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/C80a0lu3PSGEoaXcEZX3HPrG6jI=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-02-2019/t_a57fe131b0de4a33b588d179be6f297c_name_20191002_TRUMP_ANGRY_V2_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
