Duterte wore a rumpled suit and loose tie that made him look like he just got tossed through the swinging doors of a saloon. This prompted Russian journalist Pavel Vondra to observe that Duterte looked \u201ca bit unkempt\u201d for his meeting with Medvedev.\n\n\u201cThe Russian Internet is having a blast,\u201d Vondra said on Thursday. \u201c\u2018Did he drink all night? Did he just leave the pub? Do Filipinos know what protocol is?\u2019 people ask.\u201d\n\nPanelo responded that Duterte loosened his tie because \u201che feels suffocated and very uncomfortable,\u201d a not uncommon feeling among Russians, visitors to Russia, and even some people who leave Russia to live in other countries.\n\n\u201cPRRD dresses up for comfort, he is not particular on unsettling other people,\u201d Panelo stated.\n\nReuters noted that Duterte\u2019s relaxed dress and \u201cno-nonsense, man-of-the-people style\u201d have made him popular with Filipinos but often clash with \u201cthe pomp and protocol he encounters in the international political arena.\u201d", "description": "Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is criticized for his unkempt appearance during a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Duterte-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
