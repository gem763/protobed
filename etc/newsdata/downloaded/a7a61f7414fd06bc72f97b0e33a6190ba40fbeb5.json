The State Department has vehemently denied such a list existed.\n\nGiuliani, who has called Parnas one of his clients, has been a leading promoter of the unsubstantiated allegation that Biden, while vice president, pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor investigating the company in which his son was a director. The prosecutor has said the probe pre-dated Hunter Biden\u2019s role in the company.\n\nThe White House, State Department, Solomon, Toensing and DiGenova did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nBob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the materials provided by Linick appeared \u201cto contain long-debunked theories and false statements about the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and one of PresidentTrump\u2019s political opponents.\u201d\n\nHe demanded an explanation of Pompeo\u2019s role.\n\nBefore the meeting, congressional sources had told Reuters the session with Linick would focus on potential political retaliation against career State Department diplomats by the department\u2019s leadership.", "description": "Democrats, who are pursuing an impeachment probe of President Trump, received a package of documents from State Department Inspector General Steve Linick.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d954ac32100004a01f9ac87.jpeg?cache=pnmqbvya1z&ops=1778_1000"}
