I didn\u2019t\n\neven know a bluebird was a thrush. I knew\n\nand loved you, that was enough. These blues,\n\nas you called them, were yours: They seemed\n\nto fly in and out of your hands. The lake was one\n\nof those mirrorlike lakes. And the house was yours.", "description": "", "authors": ["Stanley Plumly"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/09/CULT_Poe_Bluebird/facebook.jpg?1567808700"}
