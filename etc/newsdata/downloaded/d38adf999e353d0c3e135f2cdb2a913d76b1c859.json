But I\u2019m not sure about you Joe, anyway bring it on Joe I\u2019m waiting.\u201d\n\nJoe admitted that he had had thoughts of contacting Shirley but hadn't taken the leap of faith.\n\nHe explained: \"I think ages ago we said, obviously there was two dances I didn\u2019t get to do, the Tango and the Rhumba and she said, \u2018I\u2019m the queen of Rhumba.\u2019\n\n(Image: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cAnd then I was like, \u2018We\u2019ve got to do a dance together,\u2019 you know like two boxers, they obviously want to fight each other, but it\u2019s just trying to get it sorted.\u201d\n\nJoe insisted that he would be in touch and has set a target for him to take to the dancefloor with Shirley.\n\nHe said: \"It needs to happen before the year is over!\"\n\nNo doubt his girlfriend, Strictly pro Dianne Buswell, can help him get off on the right foot with Shirley.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues Saturday at 6.40pm on BBC One.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
