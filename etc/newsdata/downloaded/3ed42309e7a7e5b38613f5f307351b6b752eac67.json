Its sprawling headquarters in Menlo Park, California, would then be buried under a blizzard of lawsuits.\n\nYet government action could also be the company\u2019s salvation. At 15 years old, Facebook is the world\u2019s most powerful adolescent. Like many teenagers, it could benefit if adults set some limits \u2014 in particular, by regulating the way it deals with politics. The alternative is for a company with 40,000 employees to continue trying to moderate the political debates of 2.7 billion people.\n\nIn its home market of the US, Facebook is under fierce attack from both sides of the political divide. The president has accused Facebook of being \u201calways anti-Trump\u201d, a charge echoed by prominent Republicans who claim that the company\u2019s algorithm downplays news from right-wing sources.\n\nFacebook\u2019s decision to de-platform some far-right commentators, such as the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, have also sparked accusations of bias.\n\nMeanwhile, the left accuses Facebook of blithe tolerance of lies and political manipulation \u2014 preferring to rake in profits and build user numbers than to face up to its political responsibilities.\n\nTo make this argument, the senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading contender for the Democratic nomination, has deliberately placed a misleading advertisement on Facebook \u2014 claiming that Mr Zuckerberg endorsed Mr Trump for re-election. Facebook has not risen to the bait by taking it down.\n\nLast week, Mr Zuckerberg argued, \u201cI don\u2019t think its right for a private company to censor politicians.\u201d This week, Facebook\u2019s boss will be back in Washington to testify before Congress on the company\u2019s ambitions for Libra, a digital currency, which, in the current anti-Facebook climate, is a tough sell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese American controversies are replicated all over the world. In the UK, many Remainers believe that ads on Facebook played a nefarious role in swinging the 2016 Brexit referendum, by targeting susceptible voters with fake news about immigration.\n\nUN investigators in Myanmar warned that Facebook was the primary means by which hatred and mass atrocities were sparked against Rohingya Muslims \u2014 hundreds of thousands of whom were forced to flee the country. AP\n\nIn Asia, the company faces even more serious allegations. UN investigators in Myanmar warned that Facebook was the primary means by which hatred and mass atrocities were sparked against Rohingya Muslims \u2014 hundreds of thousands of whom were forced to flee the country. In India, lynch mobs were allegedly mobilised using WhatsApp.\n\nFacebook is constantly having to adjust its policies and products to deal with this blizzard of complaints. It has limited the number of users to which WhatsApp messages can be forwarded, in an effort to prevent hysteria going viral.\n\nIt uses external fact-checkers, aided by artificial intelligence, to search out fake news \u2014 which is then labelled and given a lower ranking. It continues to ban advocates of terrorism and hate speech. It has deleted billions of fake accounts.\n\nBut the borderline between freedom of expression and incitement to violence \u2014 and between legitimate politicians and hate-mongers \u2014 is inevitably contested. To deal with disputes about what content Facebook should ban from its platform, the company is setting up an independent oversight board \u2014 which it rather grandly likens to the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe effort is interesting and serious. But it is surely beyond the capabilities of a single company to make nuanced judgments about political debate in hundreds of countries and languages. As a result, increasing intervention by governments is inevitable.\n\nChina \u2014 which does not believe in free speech \u2014 has simply banned Facebook. But there are less sweeping actions that can be taken. Facebook already adheres to Germany\u2019s laws on Holocaust-denial, for example, by geo-blocking that kind of content for Germany.\n\nIn the US, there is growing talk about breaking up the company. But while there might be an economic case for splitting it up, there would be no political justification to do so.\n\nThe social media age is here to stay, with all its complications. Shutting down Facebook would not change that.\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "It is surely beyond the capabilities of a single company to make nuanced judgments about political debate in hundreds of countries and languages.
