Can we still enjoy it?\n\nIn last week\u2019s article on Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day, I started with a silly but sweet bit of innuendo. It seemed a good way to introduce a book that is, for most of its 233 pages, a light, frothy delight and widely loved as a feelgood read, so much so that it was chosen as our \u201cfun\u201d book for September.\n\nI understand readers\u2019 affection; for the most part, I share it. But there\u2019s no getting around the feel-bad aspects of Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day, specifically \u2013 as a few of you have pointed out \u2013 some distinctly racist passages.\n\nWe might as well face them head-on:\n\n\u201cWell tell her not to be a damned fool and that I\u2019m the man for her and not that black-haired, oily, knife-throwing dago. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m blind.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not a dago,\u201d said Miss LaFosse furiously. \u201cIf the cap doesn\u2019t fit,\u201d said Michael blandly, \u201chow do you know who I\u2019m talking about?\u201d \u201cYou \u2026 you \u2026\u201d cried Miss LaFosse hotly and inadequately. \u201cHis great-great-grandfather was an Italian and blood will out. You can\u2019t fool me.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more, unfortunately:\n\nShe stared at him. He was dapper, neat, brisk, with brilliant, liquid brown eyes and dark hair. He had a jutting nose, a full-lipped mouth and a look about him that said he was not a man to play tricks with, yet a hint he could be pleasant enough if folks were pleasant with him. \u201cAnd yes,\u201d thought Miss Pettigrew; \u201csomewhere in his ancestry there has been a Jew.\u201d\n\nShe revisits this idea later:\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t advise marrying him,\u201d she tells her friend Miss LaFosse. \u201cI don\u2019t like to jump to conclusions but I think there was a little Jew in him. He wasn\u2019t quite English. And, well, I do think when it comes to marriage it\u2019s safer to stick to your own nationality.\u201d\n\nShorn of context, it\u2019s easy to see why these quotes cause offence. Even with context, they\u2019re hard to forgive, and I don\u2019t want to. This book was published in 1938. That kind of talk wasn\u2019t just morally poisonous. Jewish people were already being murdered and losing their rights in Nazi Germany, and refugees were being turned away at international borders.\n\nEnid Blyton had racist views. But I still read her | Sian Cain Read more\n\nThere\u2019s no point in pretending that antisemitism was not common in genteel prewar Britain, or in denying that the characters in a delightful novel would share those opinions. (The characters\u2019 beliefs as distinct from the author\u2019s.) These snatches of dialogue may upset us but also be accurate to their world. What are we to make of the fact that Watson was prepared to disfigure her otherwise beautiful creation with those lines quoted above? Should our political and moral objections to those passages alter our reading of the rest of the book?\n\nThese are perennial questions; they have been asked of Roald Dahl, HP Lovecraft, JRR Tolkien and most recently in the Guardian, Enid Blyton. My general conclusion is that you can call out racism in a book without consigning it to history. We don\u2019t have to like these things being said, but we should know about them.\n\nMiss Pettigrew Lives for a Day: has naughtiness ever been so nice? Read more\n\nAnd if you start blacklisting writers such as Winifred Watson for letting her characters say reprehensible things, where do you stop? I for one would miss reading Shakespeare and Charles Dickens and TS Eliot and just about everyone else who wasn\u2019t born in our apparently more enlightened times. Aristophanes regarded everyone who spoke in a foreign language as a barbarian (which is to say, people who said \u201cbababababa\u201d when they spoke). Do we also have to lose all of his daft knob gags as a result? What can we expect future generations to say about us? Would we be cancelled?\n\nSuch abstract arguments are very distant from the real hurt that those lines I\u2019ve quoted can cause. I still find them repulsive. But to accept that a book has imperfections is not the same as endorsing them. The world is complicated and so is literature \u2013 even when it\u2019s supposed to be fun.", "description": "Winifred Watson\u2019s daffy characters are inclined to cheerful antisemitism, at a time when Nazism was taking over Europe.
