Darcy was so kind and the memories I have are of her when she was thinking about other people.\n\n'We gave her some pocket money and told her she could spend it on anything she wanted, and she chose some little slippers for Bea.'\n\nNow Emily and her postman partner-of-five-years, Kristian D'Rosario, 30, of have launched a clothing brand - Love Darcy Clothing - in her memory, producing t-shirts, hoodies and bags with slogans such as 'brave at heart' and 'born to stand out' inspired by her.\n\nEmily, who has raised more than \u00a33,000 for Martin House Hospice for Children, in Wetherby, North Yorkshire, continued: 'The most devastating thing is that Darcy did not get to spend enough time with Bea, because that was the thing she was most excited about.

It's important that she knows all about her sister.\n\n'The house is full of pictures and it feels like there is a connection between them. If you put a picture of Darcy in front of Bea, she smiles like she knows who she is.\n\n'Darcy was like an old head on young shoulders, we would go for walks and ask her what she was doing and she would say things like 'just admiring the view'.'\n\nSix weeks after she was born, Darcy was diagnosed with VACTERL Association, a rare condition when a group of symptoms appear together more often than expected by chance.\n\nEmily, who has raised more than \u00a33000 for Martin House Hospice for Children, in Wetherby, North Yorkshire, continued: 'The most devastating thing is that Darcy did not get to spend enough time with Bea, because that was the thing she was most excited about.

Pictured with Bea\n\nShe also had a colostomy bag until she was three years old.\n\nKristian, who adored Darcy and had helped care for her since she was 18 months old, said: 'We spoke to her like an adult about her condition. We wanted to make sure she was comfortable and understood what was going on.\n\n'She was so calm about it. Whenever she was in hospital she knew it was because she needed looking after.\n\n'Even after having open heart surgery, within a few hours she wanted to get up and go to the playroom. That's what she was like.\n\n'The main problem was that it made her tired, because her heart was working harder than it should have been.\n\nKristian, who adored Darcy and had helped care for her since she was 18 months old, said: 'We spoke to her like an adult about her condition. We wanted to make sure she was comfortable and understood what was going on' Pictured: Bea in a hoodie from Love Darcy Clothing\n\n'She wasn't allowed to play as much as the other children, which was really hard for her.\n\n'If she overdid it, a few days later she would have no energy.\n\n'But, despite everything, we had been told that she would make it to adulthood. There was never any talk about her not getting to that stage.'\n\nDuring the final quarter of 2018, Darcy's health took a turn for the worst and, while she was waiting for heart surgery, her parents took her to A&E five times in two months, complaining of stomach pains.\n\nWith her immune system weakened, medics thought she probably had a urine infection or a virus.\n\nDuring the final quarter of 2018, Darcy's health took a turn for the worst and, while she was waiting for heart surgery, her parents took her to A&E five times in two months, complaining of stomach pains (Pictured in hospital)\n\nA post-mortem found Darcy (pictured) had died of a cardiac arrest, due to an infection that had got into her bloodstream, called a cardiobacterium. It can be present in the mouth, nose and throat, or heart valves\n\nBut on January 24, she blacked out while Kristian was getting her ready for school.\n\nTaking her first to the GP, they soon found themselves being taken by ambulance to York Hospital, where her condition was monitored.\n\nKristian recalled: 'She had no energy. We knew she was not well because she didn't eat much of her dinner, which was her favourite, macaroni cheese, and she offered her ice cream to Emily, which was not like her at all.\n\n'At about 4am the following day she woke up then sort of blacked out again. I ran to get the nurse and about 20 people came into the room.\n\n'She had become breathless and was struggling for air. She was essentially having a cardiac arrest.\n\nWhen Emily first told Darcy she was going to have a little sister, she was so excited she went straight to school and told all her teachers. Kristian said: 'Darcy had always wanted to be a big sister, all her friends at school had baby brothers and sisters.' Pictured: Bea visiting her grave\n\n'The medics tried to resuscitate her and worked on her for about 45 minutes, but she didn't make it.'\n\nShe was pronounced dead at 5am that morning, which was the same time Bea had been born in the same hospital five days earlier.\n\nEmily recalled: 'Darcy had been sat up talking to me about playing a few hours earlier. Then, in a flash, she was gone. I remember it clearly, I stepped back to let the medics work on her and she was very much aware of what was going on.\n\n'I remember she said, \"Where's my mummy?\" She wanted me to be in front of her. The moment she passed away she was looking right into my eyes, like she knew and didn't want to leave without seeing me.\n\nA note Darcy wrote about meeting Bea\n\n'She said right beforehand, \"I want to go home, Mummy.\" Kristian and I have spoken about that moment and whether she meant go home to her house, or that she wanted to go to heaven. We think maybe she had had enough. She'd had that many operations in her short life that maybe it took too much of a toll on her body.\n\n'Bea was in the room with us, so we were all with her.\n\n'It's so devastating to think that one moment Darcy was in hospital and we did not think she was as poorly as she was and the next, our lives had been turned upside down.'\n\nA post-mortem found Darcy had died of a cardiac arrest, due to an infection that had got into her bloodstream, called a cardiobacterium. It can be present in the mouth, nose and throat, or heart valves.\n\nThe bereavement team in the hospital directed the family to Martin House Hospice so they could spend more time with Darcy.\n\nEmily explained: 'When the hospice mentioned taking her there I was not sure if I could sit with her for five days. I didn't think I'd be able to do it, but as soon as we walked into the hospice, it felt so calm.\n\nKristian added: 'We were able to make artwork from her hands and feet.\n\nThe bereavement team in the hospital directed the family to Martin House Hospice for Children, where the couple were offered the chance to spend a few days with Darcy's body, which was in a temperature controlled bedroom downstairs, so they could say goodbye properly. Pictured: Darcy at school\n\n'Knowing she was in the same place as us was really comforting.'\n\nDarcy was buried at New Malton cemetery, just down the road from the family home, so they can visit her every day.\n\nWhen Emily first told Darcy she was going to have a little sister, she was so excited she went straight to school and told all her teachers.\n\nKristian said: 'Darcy had always wanted to be a big sister, all her friends at school had baby brothers and sisters.\n\n'She had given us strict instructions that we were not allowed to have a boy. She desperately wanted a sister, so it was a relief to us when we found out we were having a girl. Darcy came with us to the scan and her reaction when she found out was buzzing. She was so happy.'\n\nBea was born two weeks early on January 19 weighing 6lb 12oz.\n\nWhat is VACTERL Association? An 'association' in medical terms is a group of symptoms that appear together more often than would be expected by chance. VACTERL is an acronym made up of the first letters of the main symptoms that make up the condition: Vertebral defects\n\nAnorectal anomalies\n\nCardiac defects\n\nTracheo-oesphageal fistula/oesophageal atresia\n\nRenal abnormalities\n\nLimb abnormalities It's not known what causes VACTERL association, but usually all the symptoms happen very early in pregnancy. Doctors believe it's not genetic as most children born with VACTERL association do not have any close relatives with similar symptoms. It affects all races and males and females in equal numbers, affecting about 1 in 10,000 to 40,000 births. Vertebral defects affect between 60 and 80 per cent of babies born with VACTERL association to varying degrees. It means the vertebrae may be misshapen or fused or missing or there may be additional vertebrae in place. According to Great Ormond Street hospital, anorectal anomalies means that the anus has not formed properly and may be is either closed over or very narrow so faeces cannot be passed from the body in the usual way. This affects between 60 and 90 per cent of babies born with VACTERL association. Between 40 and 80 per cent of babies with VACTERL association will have a cardiac or heart defect. But the severity of the defect varies from child to child. A 'hole in the heart' are most commonly seen in VACTERL association, as well as a heart defect called Tetralogy of Fallot. Tracheo-oesophageal fistula/oesophageal atresia affect between 50 and 80 per cent of babies born with VACTERL association. This is where part of the oesophagus is joined to the trachea (windpipe) or where a short section at the top of the oesophagus (gullet or foodpipe) has not formed properly so is not connected to the stomach. This means food cannot pass from the throat to the stomach. Renal abnormalities can vary in severity and may include an absent kidney or kidneys that are formed abnormally such as a horseshoe kidney or cystic kidneys. This happens to around 50 to 80 per cent of babies born with VACTERL association. Limb abnormalities affects around 50 per cent of babies born with VACTERL association. It is often the thumb or the forearm and hand that are affected, which are missing or underdeveloped. Other abnormalities have been reported in babies born with VACTERL association \u2013 all babies are given a thorough physical examination to check for any other problems.

She wanted to be the only one to look after her.\n\n'Bea came with us when Darcy was admitted. She was really excited to have her baby sister there.
