Last season, or maybe a few seasons ago, we would have ended up drawing that game 2-2,\u201d said Wilson, who now has four goals this season.\n\nBournemouth reached 10 points from their first six matches of the campaign with 11th placed Southampton staying on seven.\n\n\u201cWe lost the game in the first half but after we changed our shape for the second half we won every second ball and we had 25 shots on goal,\u201d said Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuettl.\n\n\u201cBut the most important stat is the goals and there we lost by two.\u201d", "description": "Bournemouth climbed to third place in the Premier League as they won away at Southampton for the first time with a 3-1 triumph in Friday\u2019s south-coast derby.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432128886&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J258", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
