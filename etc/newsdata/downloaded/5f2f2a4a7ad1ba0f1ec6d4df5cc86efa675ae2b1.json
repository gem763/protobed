This dust covers the stars\u2019 light meaning the galaxies are hard or even impossible to see.\n\nStudy co-author Ivo Labb\u00e9, of the Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia, said: \u2018We figured out that the galaxy is actually a massive monster galaxy with as many stars as our Milky Way, but brimming with activity, forming new stars at 100 times the rate of our own galaxy.\u2019\n\nThe yetis could help to solve a long-standing mystery about galaxies which grew extremely quickly in the universe\u2019s earliest days.\n\n\u2018Recent studies found that some of the biggest galaxies in the young universe grew up and came of age extremely quickly, a result that is not understood theoretically,\u2019 Arizona University wrote in a statement.\n\n\u2018Massive mature galaxies are seen when the universe was only a cosmic toddler at 10% of its current age. Even more puzzling is that these mature galaxies appear to come out of nowhere: astronomers never seem to catch them while they are forming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Smaller galaxies have been seen in the early universe with the Hubble Space Telescope, but such creatures are not growing fast enough to solve the puzzle. Other monster galaxies have also been previously reported, but those sightings have been far too rare for a satisfying explanation.\u2019\n\nNow the yeti has been found, it\u2019s thought many more might be lurking out there.\n\n\u2018Our hidden monster galaxy has precisely the right ingredients to be that missing link because they are probably a lot more common,\u2019 Williams added.", "description": "But the beasts are nowhere near as scary as they sound...", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-23-at-15.21.15-045c_1571843199.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
