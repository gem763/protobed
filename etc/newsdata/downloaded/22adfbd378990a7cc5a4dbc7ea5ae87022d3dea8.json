As a professional sports person, you know you can have a balanced lifestyle, there can be a bit of both.\"\n\nThe sponsorship money was crucial to giving the women's sport a greater platform and allowing more women to go professional, she said.\n\nImage caption Sponsorship helps to support the women's game, says England international Kate Cross\n\nAsked about the gender pay gap, where men will earn up to \u00a3125,000 in the month-long tournament while women only earn up to \u00a315,000, she said it was still \"very desirable\" compared to other women's teams worldwide.\n\nA spokesman for KP Snacks said: \"We believe that snacks can be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise. We have partnered with The Hundred to help encourage families to get active through cricket.\"\n\nBut he said the company recognised \"we have a responsibility to provide people with healthier snacking choices\".\n\nSince 2005, KP has cut salt in Hula Hoops by 42% and in some McCoy's flavours by 25%, while 29 products in its range have 100 calories or fewer per pack, the spokesman said.", "description": "Health campaigners criticise The Hundred for targeting families and children with KP Snacks' brands.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17EC5/production/_109098979_gettyimages-1173369377.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
