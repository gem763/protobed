One day he\u2019s on Twitter announcing we need national rent control because, apparently, the Vermont senator walks around knowing the correct price of every housing unit in America. The next, he\u2019s declaring \u201cBillionaires Should Not Exist.\u201d\n\nAnd, hilariously, an aide to Sanders posted a video mocking Amazon.com AMZN, -0.83% founder Jeff Bezos for funding space exploration, saying \u201cwe\u2019ve got a better idea.\u201d\n\nBecause, in a fight over who should allocate American capital, bet against the guy who conjured $1 trillion out of a business plan that his wife at the time wrote in a car. And bet on the socialist crank who knew the proper price of every asset in America, all this time, and how to run Wall Street, insurance and health care (plus real estate), yet didn\u2019t make a million until age 75 and is defensive about it.\n\nSuuuurrre.\n\nCounterpoint: Billionaires haven\u2019t earned all their wealth\n\nLet\u2019s take on Sanders\u2019 idea about billionaires \u2014 which inspired the wealth-tax proposal that, along with Medicare for All, may be his most provocative policy idea. The idea is less that inherited or dynastic wealth stagnates the economy \u2014 not an unconventional thought \u2014 but that any great wealth accumulation bespeaks immorality.\n\nWho are the billionaires?\n\nI\u2019ll differ with both. And since America only has about 600 billionaires, it\u2019s a small sample to think about. (Since Rupert Murdoch controls the company NWS, -0.42% that owns MarketWatch, nothing here about him). Let\u2019s think, in broad strokes, about how they made their money and what the best of them do with it.\n\nThe picture\u2019s more flattering than Sanders thinks.\n\nMicrosoft MSFT, -1.30% co-founder Bill Gates, America\u2019s second-richest man behind Bezos, is on the verge of eradicating cholera. No. 3 Warren Buffett BRK.B, +0.27% , who knows what he\u2019s good at and what he\u2019s not, lets Gates manage his charitable money.\n\nNo. 10 Mike Bloomberg gave away $767 million last year, with much more to come. He\u2019s been campaigning for a decade to close coal-fired electricity plants, the most-concentrated source of global warming, and is now helping gun-control advocates outstrip the financial power of the National Rifle Association. When either climate or gun violence gets solved, Bloomberg will be a hero.\n\nIn all, about a third of American billionaires have signed the Giving Pledge, vowing to give away at least half of their fortunes.\n\nAnd of course, Donald Trump\u2019s foundation once gave $7 to his kid\u2019s Boy Scout troop.\n\nBezos hasn\u2019t given away much \u2014 his ex-wife signed the Giving Pledge, but he hasn\u2019t. Yet even he pledged $2 billion last year to homelessness and education causes (a drop in his bucket) and he bought the Washington Post. That may have saved the country from despotism \u2014 that is, from President Trump.\n\nNo great crime\n\nWhich brings us to the other point: The notion of billionaires as robber barons doesn\u2019t fit.\n\nThere\u2019s a cliche that behind every great fortune stands a great crime. But the crimes, if any, behind today\u2019s great fortunes look dinky alongside the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire.\n\nMicrosoft bundled a free Web browser with its Windows operating system. Horrors! Facebook sells ads, using data users give them. The humanity! And some Wall Street billionaires skate close to the edge on insider trading.\n\nHedge funds aside, look at the utility you get from relatively young companies founded by people who became billionaires.\n\nGoogle GOOG, -1.31% , of course. Amazon has cut prices of everything it touches, especially corporate computing. Netflix NFLX, -0.09% revolutionized Hollywood, streaming channels now make 500-plus scripted series yearly, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Apple AAPL, -0.49% invented the iPhone. Gilead Sciences GILD, -0.63% solved Hepatitis C \u2014 curing mine. And so on.\n\nYes, way down the list, you find people who spread vaping, and the opioid-enriched Sackler family, now being parted from their fortune by lawyers. But they\u2019re the exception.\n\nBillionaires acting on politics different than yours, from the Cathy family\u2019s promotion of anti-abortion groups with Chick-Fil-A dividends to Bloomberg\u2019s liberal agenda, are entitled to do so.\n\nSelf-made fortunes\n\nAbout 13% of the world\u2019s billionaires inherited their money, while 55% are self-made and 31% are a mix of both, according to wealth-management firm WealthX. The biggest shares come from finance and real estate (24%, says Forbes magazine), fashion and retail (11%), and technology (10%, including a third of newly minted billionaires).\n\nManufacturing and oil and gas combined \u2014 the dirty stuff \u2014 provided 13% of billionaires. And not a health-insurance mogul on the list.\n\nSanders, like his rival Elizabeth Warren, makes a good point that accumulated, stagnant wealth is bad.\n\nBut if we want higher working-class wages, push for higher minimum wages and more collective bargaining. If we want to finance government equitably, a wealth tax is as good an idea as voters decide it is. A $1 trillion deficit while domestic discretionary spending is the smallest share of the economy in decades means upper-bracket taxes are too low.\n\nBut saying wealth accumulation stagnates innovation bucks reality. The prospect of wealth is the antidote to economic stagnation, not its cause. Sitting still, betting on old ways lasting forever, causes stagnation.", "description": "Bernie Sanders is wrong when he says billionaires should be taxed.
