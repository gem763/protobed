After an action-packed day, attempting to make the shift to sleep was difficult for her to do. We were always on the search for ways to make this time of the day more enjoyable for her. My daughter is older now \u2014 beyond the target age for the new Disney Bedtime Adventure subscription box \u2014 but if she were still a wee one, I would sign up for this brand-new service in a heartbeat.\n\nThe Disney Bedtime Adventure box delivers a variety of kid-sized goods that inject a bit of fun into the nighttime routine. The boxes include a variety of items to make bedtime a positive experience and include tools to assist in easing children into sleepy time. This subscription box comes on the heels of the adult-targeted Disney Backstage Collection, which debuted at the beginning of September, and also joins Disney's other subscription box, the Deluxe Disney Princess Enchanted Collection.\n\nAbout the Disney Bedtime Adventure Box\n\nDisney\n\nDisney Bedtime Adventure is a themed experience that includes a variety of age-appropriate Disney merchandise in each shipment. The boxes are focused on various characters from both Disney cartoons and movies as well as Pixar. They even curate boxes to align with holidays such as Christmas.\n\nThere are two options for the Disney Bedtime Adventure experience. The basic Disney Bedtime Adventure Box (starting at $27.99 including shipping and handling) contains Disney pajamas, a storybook, story-inspired stickers, a reward chart for your kid's bedtime progress, plus a special offer that can be redeemed at shopDisney or in person at a Disney store. The Deluxe Disney Bedtime Adventure Box (starting $54.99 including shipping and handling) includes everything in the previously mentioned box along with two to three other items such as a stuffed animal, blanket, towel, or toy.\n\nThe boxes are available for ages/sizes ranging from 3 to 10. Thankfully, you can adjust the size as your child grows. When you sign up to subscribe, you'll be prompted to select a size, followed by what character your child would enjoy the most. Currently, the picks for the October shipment include a space-themed Mickey Mouse box, Minnie Mouse, Holiday Mickey Mouse, Holiday Minnie Mouse, Forky from \"Toy Story 4,\" and Bo Peep from \"Toy Story 4.\" Before the beginning of the next month, Disney will send an email and you can go in and make the next theme selection and change the sizing if need be.\n\nThe pricing\n\nThere is a price discount if you subscribe for an entire year. For example, for the regular box, if you sign up to receive one box monthly for the full year, you pay $27.99 per box. For a quarterly subscription (four boxes per year), the cost is $29.99 per box, and if you just want to commit to one box to start, you pay $32.99 (although keep in mind, it does auto-renew, so if you don't want to continue to receive the box, make sure to cancel in time).\n\nThe bottom line\n\nDisney\n\nThe Disney Bedtime Adventure box is a great way to lighten up the bedtime routine for Disney-loving kids. Things such as the reward chart are a handy tool for parents, while the toys and ephemera make it a joy for the little ones. Additionally, this subscription box makes for a thoughtful gift for any child in your life. Give the gift of Disney \u2026 and much-needed sleep!", "description": "Getting your kid to go to bed can be a challenge every night, but Disney's new subscription box is here to help.
