He also alleged it made false claims about active customer numbers in the prospectus for a proposed $17 million initial public offering which would have valued the business at about $74 million.\n\nIRExchange issued a supplementary prospectus after ASIC put an interim stop order on the original prospectus, but eventually pulled the plug on the IPO and refunded subscriptions.\n\nIn the prospectus, IRExchange claimed it had signed up more than 600 independent retailers \u2013 50 per cent of whom were trading on the platform regularly \u2013 and 70 food, grocery and liquor suppliers including Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser and Carlton & United Breweries.\n\nHow IRExchange works. Supplied\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company, which had raised more than $30 million from investors and spent at least $20 million on product and technology development, had also signed a memorandum of understanding with pharmacy wholesaler Sigma, which had taken an equity stake in the business.\n\nChaired by former Coca-Cola Amatil and Lion Dairy and Drinks executive Andrew Reeves, IRExchange aimed to achieve at least $4 billion in gross sales as retailers and suppliers shifted to its online portal to reduce costs.\n\nAccording to the last available accounts, it generated sales of $13 million in 2018 but lost $16.2 million, taking accumulated losses to $43 million.\n\nIt is understood Metcash, which has established an online supply portal known as indieDirect, is not interested in buying IRExchange.\n\nThe first meeting of creditors is expected to be held on October 29 or 30.", "description": "IRExchange, an online grocery wholesaler, has gone into administration after being sued by investors unhappy about a proposed recapitalisation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_386%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/23e017224ab7ae7501074cf759b09f5b4964a386", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
