Campaigning in California, he met with marijuana advocates in Los Angeles on Tuesday and planned to hold a similar meeting in Oakland on Thursday.\n\nIf elected, O\u2019Rourke pledged to use clemency power to release people now serving sentences for marijuana possession, and he called for expunging the records of those convicted of possession.\n\nHe also proposed removing cannabis-related charges as a grounds for deporting people or denying them citizenship.\n\nMore than a dozen candidates in the Democratic Party\u2019s sprawling primary field support legalizing marijuana, reflecting a significant shift in party politics in recent years.\n\nBut the issue has long been a cause of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s. As an El Paso councilman, he pressed in 2009 for a resolution encouraging the federal government to undertake an \u201copen, honest, national dialogue on ending the prohibition of narcotics,\u201d arguing that legalizing marijuana could stop drug trafficking at the U.S.-Mexico border. He co-wrote a book, \"Dealing Death and Drugs: The Big Business of Dope in the U.S. and Mexico,\" in 2011.\n\nIn his proposal Thursday, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign said proposed \"justice\" grants would be funded entirely by a tax on the marijuana industry and would go to former state and federal inmates for a period based on time served.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign said a federal tax on the industry would also fund treatment programs, re-entry services and programs in communities disproportionately affected by marijuana arrests. He also proposed tying federal criminal justice funding to a requirement that states and local governments waive licensing fees for marijuana-related businesses for low-income people who have been convicted of marijuana offenses.\n\n\u201cWe need to not only end the prohibition on marijuana, but also repair the damage done to the communities of color disproportionately locked up in our criminal justice system or locked out of opportunity because of the War on Drugs,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in a prepared statement. \u201cThese inequalities have compounded for decades, as predominantly white communities have been given the vast majority of lucrative business opportunities, while communities of color still face over-policing and criminalization. It\u2019s our responsibility to begin to remedy the injustices of the past and help the people and communities most impacted by this misguided war.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke's campaign said he would seek to regulate marijuana similarly to how alcohol is regulated, including limiting sales to adults and conducting advertising focused on deterring use by children and driving under the influence.\n\nO'Rourke proposed limiting smoking of marijuana to \u201cprivate residences and nonpublic spaces\u201d and keeping marijuana-related businesses apart from \u201cschools, daycares, churches and other incompatible land uses.\u201d\n\nNatalie Fertig and Mona Zhang contributed to this report", "description": "This early champion of marijuana legalization is trying to regain his footing in the Democratic presidential primary.", "authors": ["David Siders"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c4/cf/66c195084a53ad7ad601093b2a1e/190918-beto-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
