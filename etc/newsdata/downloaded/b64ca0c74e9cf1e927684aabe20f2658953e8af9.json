I like Nate Diaz\u2019s character. I\u2019m a fan of Nate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll be watching that fight and Nate always brings it.\n\n\u2018The fact they\u2019re making a belt for it is strange, almost WWE wrestling silliness.\n\n\u2018It is what it is. If we can just make our own belts, I\u2019d be fighting for a title in my next fight.\u2019\n\nThe BMF title has received a mixed reception from the MMA world, while Diaz\u2019s old rival Conor McGregor has taken credit for the creation of the belt.\n\nEither Masvidal or Diaz will take home a belt after their fight (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018I designed that \u2018Bad Motherf*****\u2019 belt,\u2019 McGregor said. \u2018I actually designed that. I signed off on the design of how they (UFC) are creating that belt.\u2019\n\nThe BMF title was almost scrapped last week when Diaz revealed on social media he had allegedly tested positive for a banned substance.\n\nDiaz, a vocal critic of doping, threatened to pull out of UFC 244 if his name was not cleared.\n\nThe UFC and US Anti-Doping Agency declared publicly Diaz\u2019s positive test was due to a contaminated vegan multivitamin he had taken and that the American was not guilty of any doping offence or facing a ban.\n\nMORE: Dana White says he \u2018100% knew\u2019 Nate Diaz was clean as he\u2019s cleared to fight Jorge Masvidal\n\nMORE: Nate Diaz \u2018out of UFC 244 fight with Jorge Masvidal due to elevated levels\u2019", "description": "Paul Daley has ridiculed the UFC's creation of a 'Bad Motherf*****' title for Nate Diaz's showdown with Jorge Masvidal.", "authors": ["Coral Barry"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175801674_1572281885.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
