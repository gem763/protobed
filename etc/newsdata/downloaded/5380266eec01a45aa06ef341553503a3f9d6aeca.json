Protesters have also thrown molotov cocktails at police, and vandalised and set public facilities on fire.\n\nBeijing's Hong Kong compromise is surely too little, too late Read more\n\nMany interviewed by the Guardian have said the escalating police brutality and the government\u2019s hostility towards ordinary people in past months have hurt them deeply and made it hard for them to trust the authorities again. Police have arrested nearly 1,200 people so far.\n\nOn Thursday, Lam again rejected protesters\u2019 demands to set up an independent body to investigate police use of force, and said it was impossible to give in to demands for an amnesty for those arrested, saying: \u201cThe government cannot do things that are against the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe protests, which started in early June, have morphed into a broader, and increasingly violent, anti-government movement, with animosity between police and protesters reaching boiling point.\n\nLam\u2019s comments indicate that the government will continue to use hardline measures to deal with protesters, but many protesters vowed to continue demonstrating so long as the government refuses to investigate police\u2019s abuse of power.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chief executive Carrie Lam Photograph: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Favre/EPA\n\nJust hours after Wednesday\u2019s bill withdrawal, dozens shouted slogans and set up makeshift barricades outside a police station in the Mong Kok district demanding Lam meet all of their political demands. On Thursday morning, students from several secondary schools formed human chains outside their schools to protest against recent police brutality.\n\nLam also refused to step down, reiterating that she had \u201ca sense of responsibility to help Hong Kong to \u2018zhibao zhiluan\u2019 (\u201cput a stop to violence and chaos\u201d)\u201d and to get back to normal.\n\nLam however sidestepped a reporter\u2019s question about whether the government would launch an emergency law with sweeping powers if protests did not stop. After Lam\u2019s announcement, a pro-Beijing politician suggested that if protests continued, the authorities should invoke the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, which enables the government to impose draconian measures, including censorship and suppression of publications and communications, to quell unrest.\n\nThe withdrawal, which marks a u-turn after months of vows not to back down to the protesters, comes less than a month before China celebrates its national, day on 1 October, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.", "description": "Leader refuses to resign and backs police handling of protests despite widespread claims of brutality", "authors": ["Verna Yu"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc48095da81543eb312b83255c2f92609e573a59/0_272_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f13e605be85cf93f77d880f35ebe9f43", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
