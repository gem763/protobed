I wish you were still alive,\" Angie, the daughter of US Army Master Sgt. Luis Deleon-Figueroa said during the service. \"It doesn't feel right without you. I want to thank you for being a great hero and a great daddy.\n\n\"I know you're in heaven now, daddy, with my grandma. But I miss you so much,\" Angie said. \"I miss our time together. I'll miss going to the beach and the movie theaters together. I miss your hugs and kisses. I will try to make you proud and behave like you always told me to.\"\n\nDeleon-Figueroa, a 31-year-old Puerto Rico native and a Chicopee, Massachusetts, resident, served in the US Army for over 13 years and was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne). He was killed by small arms fire during a joint raid with Afghan forces in the Faryab province of Afghanistan on August 22.\n\n\"You are forever my papi and know that my mom and family will take care of me. I used to be your angel and now, you're mine,\" Angie added.\n\nUS Army Master Sgt. Jose Gonzalez, 35, was also killed in the raid.\n\nDeleon-Figueroa served six deployments, including to Iraq and a previous deployment to Afghanistan, according to Stars and Stripes.\n\nFourteen service members have been killed in Afghanistan so far this year. A total of 13 troops were killed in Afghanistan the previous year.
