McCabe alleges in the suit filed Thursday that he was ousted \u201cfor his refusal to pledge allegiance to a single man\u201d\u2014President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIt was Trump\u2019s unconstitutional plan and scheme to discredit and remove DOJ and FBI employees who were deemed to be his partisan opponents because they were not politically loyal to him,\u201d the complaint alleges. \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s termination was a critical element of Trump\u2019s plan and scheme.\u201d\n\nMcCabe goes on to charge that \u201cTrump demanded Plaintiff\u2019s personal allegiance, he sought retaliation when Plaintiff refused to give it, and [former Attorney General Jeff] Sessions, [FBI Director Christopher] Wray, and others served as Trump\u2019s personal enforcers rather than the nation\u2019s highest law enforcement officials, catering to Trump\u2019s unlawful whims instead of honoring their oaths to uphold the Constitution.\u201d\n\nWray and Attorney General William Barr are named as co-defendants in the 48-page federal suit, which describes a chaotic, rushed effort to oust McCabe before he was eligible to collect his pension\u2014as Trump blasted him across social media.\n\nJust days before he was fired, a Justice Department official allegedly admitted to McCabe that the agency was not following established practices and procedures in connection with the disciplinary process, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re making it up as we go along.\u201d\n\nMcCabe has long been one of the president\u2019s top targets and clashed with him soon after Trump took office.\n\nAccording to the suit, in February 2017, Trump had his then chief of staff, Reince Priebus, ask McCabe\u2014then the deputy director\u2014to publicly refute a news story that made the new president look bad. When McCabe declined, \u201cPriebus said that Plaintiff and the FBI were \u2018not being good partners\u2019 to Trump,\u201d the suit says.\n\nAfter Trump fired James Comey as FBI director several months later, McCabe temporarily took his post, and the FBI\u2019s investigation into how the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 presidential election continued unhindered\u2014much to the president\u2019s chagrin. Trump homed in on McCabe as a bad actor, claiming that support from Clinton allies for his wife\u2019s unsuccessful bid for state office meant McCabe needed to recuse himself from the investigation.\n\nMcCabe didn\u2019t step back, though, and the president began sending dozens of tweets castigating him.\n\nThe situation only got worse. Barely a day before McCabe would have become eligible for his retirement pension, and late on a Friday, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired him from the post. Sessions said he did so because the FBI\u2019s inspector general found he shared information with the media without authorization and lacked candor when speaking under oath to internal investigators.\n\nBut among veterans of federal law enforcement community, the move was broadly seen as a political attack designed to punish McCabe for the FBI\u2019s investigation of the president. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, meanwhile, praised the firing and said he hoped Special Counsel Robert Mueller would be ousted next.\n\nA month later, the inspector general released a report saying McCabe engaged in misconduct and misled investigators\u2014findings McCabe strongly denied.\n\nAfter his firing, McCabe became a hero to Trump\u2019s many opponents. A GoFundMe page to cover his legal expenses raised more than $500,000, and his book topped bestseller lists.\n\nHe isn\u2019t the first Trump foil to take legal action against the Justice Department. Peter Strzok, a senior FBI counterintelligence agent who worked on the Russia probe, sued the FBI and the DOJ earlier this week for wrongful termination. He argues that the firing violated his rights under the First and Fifth Amendments. Strzok was removed from Mueller\u2019s team after the special counsel learned he and an FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, exchanged numerous texts criticizing Trump and his supporters. He was subsequently fired from the FBI.", "description": "McCabe was ousted barely a day before he would have become eligible for his retirement pension in a move widely seen as payback.", "authors": ["Betsy Woodruff", "Tracy Connor", "Political Reporter", "Executive Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_285/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1565286182/GettyImages-681974904_c30sau", "published_at": "2019-08-08"}
