The Center added tropical storm watches for Puerto Rico and both the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, saying they could be hit Tuesday with heavy rain, flash flooding and tropical-storm-force winds.\n\nThe Windward Islands are forecast to get as much as 8 inches of rain, while up to 6 inches could hit parts of Puerto Rico and the Virgin islands. The forecast for Karen didn\u2019t extend far enough out to show if it will eventually threaten the U.S. mainland. The Hurricane Center doesn\u2019t expect the storm to strengthen in the next two days. Karen formed during a busy time for extreme weather in the Atlantic. Jerry, another tropical storm to the north, could brush by Bermuda early this week as it heads northeast. Meanwhile, the Hurricane Center said there was a 90% chance that a disturbance off West Africa could become a tropical cyclone within 48 hours.
