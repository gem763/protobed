I Want to Strangle Them\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Detective Logan Hough got the call at about 9 a.m. on a sweltering late-August day in North Florida. Someone at the court clerk\u2019s office had opened a letter that he should see right away.\n\nThe letter had been intended for the Bradford County Sheriff\u2019s Office where he works, but it had gotten mixed up in the mail. Deliveries there get mixed up all the time. The address for the clerk\u2019s office begins with 945. The address for the sheriff\u2019s office is 945-B.\n\nWhat Hough found inside the envelope was unlike anything he had seen.\n\nIt read like the plans of a serial killer.\n\n\u201cEvery time I see young beautiful females, ages 15-30, I so badly wish to lure them to my van, take them to a remote location, and pleasure them,\u201d the handwritten letter said. \u201cWhen they are thoroughly pleasured, I want to strangle them, either with my hands or a ligature.\u201d\n\nThe letter went on in grisly detail about how the writer planned to dismember the bodies, cutting off the women\u2019s fingers and scattering them to \u201cincrease the size of the crime scene and throw off law enforcement.\u201d\n\nIt also included a list of things the writer planned to do to prepare for his crimes, including purchasing items like handcuffs, a hand saw, pruners, stretch wrap, latex gloves, \u201ccannabis product to relax the woman/girl,\u201d and, most chillingly, \u201cbags for transport of head and fingers.\u201d\n\nThe three-page letter carried no name, but it included a cipher at the end, taunting the recipients in a Zodiac-like fashion to figure out who sent it. \u201cI\u2019d sign but that would be too easy,\u201d it said.\n\nIt also bragged \u201cFingerprint Free!\u201d with a smiley face drawn next to the phrase.\n\n\u201cThat was part of his game that he was playing,\u201d Hough said in a recent interview with The Daily Beast. \u201cHe had all his plans laid out and a shopping list and everything. We definitely took it as a serious threat.\u201d\n\nThe FBI did too. Not long after receiving the letter, Hough got a call from a special agent in Colorado.\n\nThere were other letters, the agent told him. On the opposite side of the country, the Seattle Police Department had received a letter identical to the one sent to Florida. A television station in Denver, ABC affiliate KMGH, had received a single-page letter from the same writer.\n\n\u201cGet ready to cover a fun story. A game is commencing!\u201d the Denver letter said. \u201cPolice in Seattle PD and the Sheriff in Bradford County Florida are going to be trying to find a disturbed individual with plans to murder countless young women.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cgame,\u201d however, did not get far.\n\nOn Aug. 29, federal authorities arrested 33-year-old Daniel Alfred Gallegos of Grand Junction, Colorado, and accused him of sending the threatening letters. A federal judge has since ordered Gallegos held without bail, finding him to be a danger to the community.\n\nCourt documents describe how FBI Special Agent John Busch was able to crack the case without anyone getting hurt.\n\nIt all came down to the postage stamps.\n\nAffixed to the envelope for each letter was a stamp seemingly as generic as could be\u2014adorned with an American flag and the initials USA. But on the left side of each stamp was also a tiny barcode and serial number.\n\nWith the help of U.S. postal inspectors, Busch was able to track the three stamps back to a kiosk in a post office in Grand Junction. The kiosk also captured surveillance footage of the buyer as well as his credit-card info.\n\nThe card, according to court documents, was owned by Gallegos, and the face in the surveillance footage matched his picture from his driver\u2019s license.\n\nIt was enough for a judge to sign off on an arrest warrant and for Busch to make the collar the next day.\n\nNot much is publicly known about Gallegos, and the public defender assigned to his case declined to be interviewed for this article.\n\nHowever, court documents describe Gallegos as a drifter, possibly homeless and living out of his silver Chrysler minivan, with a recent history of run-ins with the law.\n\nIn October 2018, Grand Junction police responded to a call from Gallegos\u2019 wife, who said her husband was threatening to kill himself. When officers arrived, according to records, Gallegos said his medications were off and \u201cthat he felt like killing.\u201d He was taken to a nearby psychiatric hospital.\n\nAbout a month later, police were called again by Gallegos\u2019 wife. This time, Gallegos was armed with a knife and told officers \u201cabout being cannibalistic and that he was going to eat people.\u201d Again, he was taken to the same hospital.\n\nIn June, according to court records, Gallegos was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence against his wife in an incident that occurred inside his van. The details of that incident were not immediately available.\n\nDuring his investigation, Busch learned that Gallegos had lost his job in February after a mental-health provider notified his employer about his \u201chomicidal ideations.\u201d\n\nThe letters that were sent to Bradford County and Seattle specifically addressed multiple mental-health diagnoses.\n\n\u201cI have been admitted to a psychiatric hospital for homicidal ideation at which time I was misdiagnosed with OCD and MD,\u201d the letters said, likely using the abbreviations for obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depression. \u201cThis will prove to be a grave mistake. My urges are stronger than ever.\u201d\n\nIn a post-script, the writer of the letter mentioned another possible diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI may also be bipolar, which means I am prone to drastic actions during mania,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you think this is a joke, think again. Clock\u2019s ticking. My control wavers. Thought you deserved a head start. Sort of.\u201d\n\nIn the court documents, there was no evidence\u2014other than his say so\u2014that Gallegos had indeed been diagnosed with any specific mental illness. And it\u2019s important to note that research published by the American Psychological Association has shown that mental illness and crime are not generally linked.\n\nThe capture of Gallegos brought a sigh of relief for Hough, the Bradford County detective.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unusual for our area. We don\u2019t typically see or hear things like this,\u201d Hough said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of details, sounds like he\u2019s been thinking about this or planning this for a while.\u201d\n\nBradford County Sheriff\u2019s Major Brad Smith said the quick work was a testament to the kind of cross-country coordination that law enforcement can do these days. It\u2019s a result of lessons learned over decades of dealing with serial killers and mass shooters, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting better understanding that when they make these threats, they\u2019re not idle,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou have to follow up on them and you have to pursue them like it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d", "description": "This summer a series of letters shocked law enforcement across the country, detailing how a man planned to maim and murder women.", "authors": ["Nick R.
