If left unchecked, digital inaccessibility can also be expensive and harmful to your brand.\n\nLawsuits against companies with inaccessible sites are increasing and the US federal government has mandated (via the 21st Century IDEA Act) that all its sites and content must report on the status of their Section 508 accessibility compliance by the end of the year. Recent headlines aside, we often don\u2019t stop to consider accessibility from a dollars and cents perspective, but when we do, the results are eye-opening.\n\nMy team and I recently conducted a careful analysis to determine exactly how much accessibility issues are costing a typical enterprise within the sectors that are most impacted by accessibility complaints and lawsuits, including retail and e-commerce, travel and hospitality, entertainment, food service, banking/finance, and self-service.\n\nThe study is focused on the US market, but companies all around the world should be aware of the costs. Here\u2019s what we found, followed by suggestions on what organizations should be doing about it.\n\nThe costs of responding to a digital ADA complaint are staggering\n\nIf a user has been discriminated against because of their disability, they may file an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) complaint against your business. Discrimination manifests in many ways, but we\u2019re going to focus on digital inaccessibility.\n\nAn ADA complaint is a \u201cwarning shot\u201d for additional legal action to come. Fixing accessibility issues in reaction to an ADA complaint can be quite expensive. We\u2019ll talk about proactive accessibility testing looks like later in this post, but first, let\u2019s break down the reactive costs:\n\nUsing average compensation and labor timeframes gathered in the course of our work with Fortune 50 companies, we estimated that addressing of a single web accessibility complaint costs almost $10,000.\n\nHow did we arrive at that number? We calculated a combination of call center personnel and management, regulatory personnel, product management, developers, quality assurance and operations staff, in a blended rate of $120/hour x the number of individuals involved x total hours spent. I\u2019d highly encourage you to arrive at your own blended rate and reference the table below to calculate your own potential costs.\n\nThis means 100 such complaints per year will cost almost a million dollars.\n\nYou also can\u2019t forget the legal costs, which can be huge\n\nLawsuits against companies with inaccessible websites exploded 181 percent from 2017 to 2018. Since the beginning of 2019, several high-profile organizations found themselves in the crosshairs of digital accessibility lawsuits.\n\nOnce again relying on data from our experiences with Fortune 50 companies, we examined the costs associated with the litigation processes \u2014 including inside and potentially outside counsel \u2014 as well as court fees, documentation costs, and more.\n\nWhen all of these costs were added up \u2014 at the higher average worker cost of $225 per hour \u2014 we determined that a simple and quickly settled digital accessibility lawsuit would cost the defendant an estimated $350,000.\n\nYou need to also consider the lost market opportunity\n\nIt\u2019s a bit harder to specify a monetary amount for this one, but consider the following takeaways from \u201cThe Purchasing Power of Working-Age Adults With Disabilities\u201d and American Institutes for Research. The total after-tax disposable income for working-age Americans with disabilities is approximately $490 billion.\n\nThis is almost as big as the African American ($501 billion) and Hispanic ($582 billion) markets in the United States. People with disabilities represent 35 percent of working-age adults \u2013 that\u2019s 20 million people. If your website is not accessible, you are locking out huge market segments.\n\nWith costs so high, what can you do? The best defense is a good offense, and accessibility demands a pragmatic approach. Start with the following:\n\n1. Proactively address accessibility from the earliest possible stages of the development process\n\nFailure to identify exclusionary design is significantly more expensive and risky after the software goes into production. It also means fixes need to be implemented after you\u2019ve already deployed, potentially creating disruptions to your development process and loading up your backlog.\n\nAccessibility testing should be integrated into your early development process where we\u2019ve seen most developers catch 30 to 50 percent of all potential accessibility lapses. Ideally, accessibility should be considered as early as the design phase of your process.\n\nHowever, even the most accessible websites in the world will contain flaws, and organizations must continue to be diligent with accessibility testing after deployment, including regression testing (making sure code changes do not inadvertently introduce new accessibility issues).\n\n2. Start small and continuously build on successes\n\nAddressing accessibility for the first time can seem like an overwhelming process. The good news: you can start for free by utilizing some great automated testing tools or include accessibility tests into your existing testing environment with an accessibility rules libraries, which is open-sourced and continually enriched by actual developers.\n\nDon\u2019t focus on unrealistic perfection right out of the gate. Begin by incorporating basic best practices for the most critical issues \u2014 for example, adding captions to videos for users with hearing impairments; clear image descriptions (e.g. \u201cclick here to buy brown loafers\u201d) when someone who is visually impaired uses a screen reader \u2014 and then strive for constant improvement.\n\n3. Motivate and empower developers\n\nMotivating developers is key to a sustainable, impactful web accessibility initiative. A great way to foster your development team\u2019s enthusiasm for accessibility is to host empathy events where your team can learn and directly experience how people with disabilities use technology and how their disabilities and assistive technologies impact that experience.\n\nSome developers value participating in open source projects and communities, and today there are abundant opportunities to contribute to these projects supporting the Web, Android, iOS, and Windows platforms. Many of these projects are still nascent, so there are lots of opportunities to make valuable and meaningful contributions.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn our increasingly empathic society, accessibility \u2014 or the lack of it \u2014 is becoming a more visible issue. No longer a nice-to-have, it is quickly becoming a must-have. There is clear evidence among development teams that accessibility is becoming an ingrained part of their jobs.\n\n\n\nWe are fortunate to live in a society that encourages innovations that enable people with disabilities to navigate the internet independently. If your organization isn\u2019t keeping up with this wave of innovation and inclusion, you may be at risk for incurring large costs. Besides enriching the lives of millions of persons with disabilities, practicing accessibility proactively protects your brand and bottom line.", "description": "If left unchecked, digital inaccessibility can become incredibly expensive and harmful to your brand - so it's best to keep it in mind from the beginning.", "authors": ["Greg Williams", "September"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/podium?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F09%2FUntitled-design110.png&signature=392a99ef1efd0b7234eaa51775a9f3e6", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
