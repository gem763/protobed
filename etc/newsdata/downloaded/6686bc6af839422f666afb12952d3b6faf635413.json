These fetishes include supplying and personally administering dangerously large doses of narcotics to his victims.\u201d\n\nBuck, 65, is a retired entrepreneur who has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to political action groups and local and national politicians. He has long faced allegations of drugging young black men for sexual pleasure. Two of those men died of overdoses in his home in 2017 and 2018, but charges were never brought against him.\n\nThat changed Tuesday night when Buck was arrested on connection with the overdose of a third man who narrowly survived his encounter with the wealthy West Hollywood resident\u2014and a syringe of methamphetamine.\n\nAccording to court papers, the victim, identified only as Joe Doe, visited Buck\u2019s apartment on Sept. 4, where Buck gave him a large dose of methamphetamine.\n\nDemocratic Donor Ed Buck Accused of Human Trafficking and Revenge Porn: Court Docs\n\nFearing he was overdosing, the victim fled the apartment to get medical help. A week later, he returned to Buck\u2019s home, and Buck allegedly injected two doses this time\u2014and the man began to overdose again.\n\n\u201cBuck refused to render aid to Doe, but rather thwarted Doe\u2019s attempts to get help,\u201d prosecutors wrote. The man managed to leave and called 911 from a gas station they said.\n\n\u201cBuck is clearly a predator with no regard for human life. His behavior is malicious and beyond reckless,\u201d they said, adding that he preys on men who are drug abusers or homeless, using \u201cbait\u201d of narcotics, money or shelter.\n\nProsecutors revealed that police found hundreds of photographs of men in compromising positions when they searched Buck\u2019s home. \u201cIt is only a matter of time before another one of these vulnerable young men dies of an overdose,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThey are seeking $4 million bail for Buck, who was charged with battery causing serious injury, administering methamphetamine, and maintaining a drug house.\n\nBuck\u2019s attorney did not return calls for comment but in the past has denied that his client caused any harm.\n\nBuck is already facing a wrongful death lawsuit by the mother of Gemmel Moore, a 26-year-old black man who died in Buck\u2019s apartment on July 27, 2017, surrounded by drug paraphernalia, according to court papers.\n\nThe suit says Buck solicited Moore for sex and insisted he inject him with crystal meth. In Moore\u2019s last journal entry, dated Dec. 3, 2016, he wrote, \u201cIf it didn\u2019t hurt so bad, I\u2019d kill myself, but I\u2019ll let Ed Buck do it for now.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department opened an investigation into Moore\u2019s death, but District Attorney Jackie Lacey declined to file criminal charges, prompting Moore\u2019s family to name the DA as a co-defendant in the lawsuit.\n\nWealthy Democratic Donor Ed Buck Waited 15 Minutes to Call 911 for Man Who Died in His Home\n\nIn January, Timothy Dean, another gay black man, died at Buck\u2019s home\u2014on a mattress littered with drug paraphernalia and sex toys, according to a coroner\u2019s report.\n\nBuck claimed that Dean had been acting bizarrely before he left him to take a shower and that he was unconscious when he returned. He told investigators he performed CPR on Dean for 15 minutes before calling paramedics, the coroner\u2019s report said.\n\nIn their court filing, prosecutors said Buck\u2019s \u201caggressive and malevolent behavior\u201d led to Moore\u2019s and Dean\u2019s deaths but did not explain why he had never been charged with a crime for them.\n\nJasmyne Cannick, an activist who has been working with Moore\u2019s family, rushed to Buck\u2019s home when she heard the news of his arrest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit overwhelmed right now,\u201dshe tweeted from the scene. \u201cThis has been two years of my life fighting for this man to be arrested.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing able to call Gemmel\u2019s mother and Timothy\u2019s sister and tell them that Ed Buck had been arrested was such a great feeling.
