We\u2019re not the best team in the world yet but we\u2019ve got ourselves another week in the comp.\u201d\n\nBeaten at a World Cup for the first time since 2007, the All Blacks had no excuses, admitted they were outplayed by a superior opponent.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a good team so there\u2019s no shame in getting beat by them,\u201d New Zealand coachSteve Hansen said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of hurt.\u201d\n\nWhile last week\u2019s 24-point flogging against England was humiliating enough, it would have been even worse if the Poms played as well as they did against the All Blacks.\n\nRarely has a New Zealand team ever looked so rattled as the defending champions were against an English side that could have won by more if not for two disallowed tries, two missed penalties and a fluffed attempt at a drop goal.\n\nEngland cheers, All Blacks tears after momentous semi-final England fans were celebrating in Yokohama on Saturday night after their side reached the World Cup final with a 19-7 defeat of the defending champions New Zealand. Francesca Lynagh reports.\n\n.\n\nEngland did get one big lucky break when Henry Slade was allowed to stay on the field after he led with his shoulder in a tackle, an offence that might have earned him a red card earlier in the tournament when referees were clamping down on everything, but they fully deserved their win.\n\n\u201cThey played a tremendous game of footy,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cWe just weren't good enough so we have to take that on the chin.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that Jones has been involved in three of the biggest upsets in World Cup history: when the Wallabies beat New Zealand in the 2003 semis, when Japan stunned South Africa in the pool rounds four years ago and now in Yokohama.\n\nEach time, he\u2019s shown that the key to winning is to have a varied and adaptable game, a lesson the southern hemisphere teams may all have to relearn if the unthinkable happens and Wales beat South Africa to ensure the first all Northern Hemisphere final.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to pay the greatest compliment to New Zealand. They\u2019ve won two World Cups in a row and they have been a great team so we had to dig really deep to beat them,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cWe knew we had to come off the line hard and keep taking away time and space from them and we managed to do that.\n\nmedia_camera England's defence was brutal.\n\n\u201cI think World Cups are always about defence and our best form of attack is our defence.\u201d\n\nEngland served notice of their intent when they didn\u2019t stand in a single line to face the haka, and the writing was on the wall for the All Blacks after less than two minutes when Manu Tuilagi crashed over after a flawless series of phases from England.\n\nWhat happened next caught everyone by surprise.\n\nEngland didn\u2019t score any more tries but they didn\u2019t need to as the All Blacks contributed to their own defeat by losing their composure - just as they used at every World Cup after 1987 before ending their title drought in 2011.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s only try came gift wrapped from England hooker Jamie George when he overthrew a lineout close to his own line and lobbed the ball straight to Ardie Savea but their reign as world champions is now over.\n\n\"It was a big game. It was a World Cup semi-final against the All Blacks. It doesn\u2019t get any bigger at this stage,\u201d England captain Owen Farrell said.\n\n\u201cWe felt like we prepared well and we started the game well.\n\nmedia_camera England players Tom Curry (left) and Billy Vunipola enjoy the win\n\n\"In all these big games, teams get physical and go at each other from the off and we knew that was going to come our way. We wanted to make sure we were playing that way, too.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got a number of ways of playing. We\u2019ve got a big, powerful pack but they can use the ball as well. We play to play to space, and tonight we did that well.\n\n\"It\u2019s brilliant to get there. It\u2019s brilliant to be a part of. We\u2019ll enjoy this win first, but we\u2019ll make sure we prepare well (for the final.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand captain Kieran Read was shattered by the result.\n\nmedia_camera England's Anthony Watson, looks to fend off New Zealand's Angus Ta'avao\n\n\"It\u2019s hard to put into words what it means, but you\u2019ve got to give the English the credit. They started extremely well and we just couldn\u2019t get into our game,\u201d New Zealand captain Kieran Read said.\n\n\"We\u2019ll look at the game and there will be so many what-ifs and things we could have done a lot better. On days like this, you can\u2019t afford it.\"\n\nEngland\u2019s powerful lock Mari Itoje created endless problems for the All Blacks, both in the set pieces and the loose, but said it was all just part of his job.\n\n\"It was a proper test match. Fair play to the All Blacks, they were the best team in the world for a reason,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe really had to play for 80 minutes. I\u2019m thankful to my team-mates and the coaches. It was a good day at the office for us.\u201d\n\nENGLAND 19 (Manu Tuilagi try Owen Farrell con George Ford 4 pens) bt NEW ZEALAND 7 (Ardie Savea try Richie Mo\u2019unga con) at Nissan Stadium.
