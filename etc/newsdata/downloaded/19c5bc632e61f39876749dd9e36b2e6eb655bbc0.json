It committed an additional $9.5 billion to the roughly $10 billion SoftBank has already sunk into the startup.\n\nWeWork's new executive chairman Marcelo Claure addressed employee concerns at a sometimes tense meeting in the company's New York headquarters on Wednesday\n\nClaure addressed inevitable layoffs, founder Adam Neumann's (above) staggering $1.7 billion exit package, and employee fury over stock options that are now worthless\n\n'This is probably the largest bet ever made. That\u2019s because we believe in the mission of this company,' Claure said in a transcript of the meeting leaked to ReCode. 'Now that said, there\u2019s going to be some very difficult times ahead for all of us.'\n\nThe transcript corresponded to other partial leaks from the meeting, but could not be independently verified in its entirety by DailyMail.com. WeWork did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday morning.\n\nClaure says employees who are laid off will be 'taking one for the team'\n\nSources close to WeWork have mentioned a range of figures for possible layoffs in recent weeks, from as few as 2,000 to as many as 5,000.\n\nThe job cut will amount to just under a third of WeWork's global workforce, and about 1,000 of the cuts will hit employees such as janitorial staff, according to a source cited by the Financial Times.\n\n'Are there going to be layoffs? Yes. How many? I don\u2019t know,' Claure said in his opening remarks at the staff meeting, according to the transcript.\n\nClaure said that anyone who was laid off would 'leave with dignity'.\n\n'It\u2019s always painful. You know, they\u2019re never, it\u2019s never a day of joy, right?' he said later in response to an employee question.\n\n'But it\u2019s something that whoever is laid off, they\u2019re going to know that they\u2019re taking one for the team to make sure this company thrives in the future,' he continued.\n\nClaure is seen meeting with WeWork employees after the meeting. He pledged to be open with the company's staff and addressed topics like layoffs head-on\n\nLater in the meeting, an employee told Claure that WeWork's properties have 'a ton of defects'.\n\nThe employee said: 'So my question is, when you\u2019re doing these, you know, tough decisions for layoffs, will you be taking into account that we do need to keep a lot of people on to fix the defects?'\n\nClaure largely sidestepped the allegation that WeWork's buildings are filled with 'defects,' saying simply that 'we should eliminate defects as they come'.\n\nClaure insists that Neumann's $1.7B exit package has been misrepresented in the press\n\nAlthough Neumann resigned as CEO in September following the implosion of the company's planned IPO, he remained executive chairman and controlled the board through special voting rights.\n\nAs part of the SoftBank bailout, Neumann agreed to relinquish control in exchange for a lucrative deal valued at $1.7 billion.\n\nThe deal includes giving Neumann the right to sell his stake in the company for as much as $970 million as part of a tender offer, in which SoftBank will buy up to $3 billion in WeWork shares from investors and employees. He currently owns a little over one fifth of WeWork.\n\nSoftBank has also agreed to extend him a $500 million loan to repay a credit line from JPMorgan Chase & Co, as well as pay him a $185 million fee for a four-year assignment as a consultant to WeWork, sources said.\n\nAs part of the SoftBank bailout, Neumann (above) agreed to relinquish control in exchange for a lucrative deal valued at $1.7 billion\n\nClaure is seen with SoftBank Masayoshi Son, his boss and mentor. Son previously installed Claure as CEO of Sprint to oversee the company's turnaround\n\nAt the staff meeting, an infuriated employee grilled Claure on the deal, saying: 'We\u2019ve seen in the news, Adam\u2019s getting paid a billion dollars, right?'\n\n'I\u2019ve been here since April 2017 and basically every quarter we\u2019ve heard, \u201cTrust me, trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me\",' the employee went on. 'What is it that\u2019s going to change? We need to see change.'\n\nClaure insisted that Nuemann's package had been exaggerated by the press.\n\n'As a shareholder, he has the ability to sell his shares. He founded the company, he has a tremendous amount of shares. So nobody\u2019s paying Adam a billion dollars or $1.7 billion,' Claure said.\n\n'Two, Adam for whatever reason, borrowed money from JPMorgan,' Claure continued. 'So we made the decision to lend Adam a certain amount of money for him to pay his loan. But in exchange as he sells those shares, he needs to pay us right back.'\n\n'And then thirdly is we\u2019re paying him a consulting fee,' Claure said, explaining that the fee was in exchange for Neumann relinquishing his special voting rights, as well as for actual advice Nuemann may give Claure in the future.\n\nNotably, Claure stressed that Neumann would have no role in running the company in the future.\n\n'I do plan to use him, but he\u2019ll be Adam with me, and me with you. So Adam is not going to have any role in the company, he\u2019s not going to be in the board of directors, but I do plan to use some of his knowledge,' Claure said.\n\nClaure says WeWork will 'readjust' employee stock options that are worthless under the new valuation\n\nSoftBank's takeover deal valued the company at just $8 billion, a huge decline from the $47 billion valuation in WeWork's last funding round in January.\n\nAs part of the deal, SoftBank offered to purchase shares from existing investors and employees at $19.19 per share.\n\nThat is reportedly less than the exercise price of any employee stock options issued since January 2016, making any options issued since then worthless under the current valuation.\n\nNeumann's case is different, in that he owns his shares outright and can sell them at a profit even under the lower valuation.\n\nClaure greets employees at the meeting. He dealt with anxious questions about layoffs and stock options that are currently worthless under the new valuation\n\nEmployees who have seen their own dreams of a stock payout dashed were seething this week on the company's internal messaging system, some noting the irony of Neumann walking away with the spoils at a company called 'We'.\n\nIn the meeting, Claure admitted that options had been issued at 'crazy valuations' and pledged to look into 'readjusting' terms of employee stock compensation.\n\n'Give me a couple of weeks,' Claure said. 'I cannot commit to something where I don\u2019t know the entire, the potential financial implications, but if you have options that are underwater or that we know is going to take many years to get back, they\u2019re worthless and nobody should have a worthless options when we are, think of this as a day that\u2019s a new day, is a start over and I\u2019m going to look at the compensation that we have set up as a company.\n\n'I\u2019m going to work with the HR team to make sure that we do something in this standard.'", "description": "Marcelo Claure, a SoftBank executive who took the reins at WeWork this week as part of the Japanese investment firm's\u00a0bailout of the startup, made the remarks in a staff meeting Wednesday.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/16/20183100-0-image-a-2_1572015657216.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
