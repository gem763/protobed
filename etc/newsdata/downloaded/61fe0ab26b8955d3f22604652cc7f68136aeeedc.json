They settled for three points each time. And kicking a field goal instead of letting their star rookie quarterback Kyler Murray try to score a touchdown may have cost the Cardinals the game: They lost by six points.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to execute and tighten things up in the red zone,\u201d Arizona coach Kliff Kingsbury said.\n\nOr they have to change the way they think entirely. Football teams like to believe they\u2019re smarter than ever. In some ways, they are. They are throwing more, playing out of the shotgun and beginning to adopt some of the basic strategies that quants have grown hoarse yelling about.\n\nBut what happened this weekend, in both pro and college football, was only the latest evidence that there is still a gaping inefficiency when it comes to one of the sport\u2019s most crucial decisions. The coaches paid millions of dollars to succeed in a multibillion-dollar industry are still too conservative on fourth down.\n\nThis is one of the baffling things about modern sports. It has never been easier for coaches to behave rationally, and yet they still manage to be irrational.\n\nIt isn\u2019t weird that football coaches are obstinate. The weird part is that they should know by now that their obstinacy is costly. One study in the Journal of Sports Analytics found \u201cno obvious change over time\u201d in the rate of NFL teams going for it on fourth down between 2004 and 2016. This study also quantified just how much teams hurt themselves with their suboptimal decision-making. It suggested that the average team could add 0.4 win per year simply by being more aggressive.\n\nThat has finally begun to change in recent years. NFL teams between 2000 and 2017 went for it 32% of the time on fourth-and-1 or fourth-and-2. That rate skyrocketed to 45% last year. But the sudden increase had a strange effect. When more teams were beginning to do something smart, it became more jarring when other teams weren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t universal,\u201d said Michael Lopez, one of the study\u2019s authors and the NFL\u2019s director of data and analytics. \u201cThere are gaps in strategy between the teams.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals inadvertently became the poster child of this curious behavior on Sunday afternoon. They hired Kingsbury, who had recently been fired from his college job, precisely because he\u2019s a progressive thinker and innovative play-caller. And his offense worked against a vaunted Ravens defense. Murray, the No. 1 pick in last year\u2019s draft, finished with 349 yards on 40 passes, and even those numbers undersell how brilliantly he played at times.\n\nBut there was a reason all of that production resulted in only 17 points: The Cardinals were historically timid on fourth down. They were the first team in more than three decades to kick three field goals from inside the 5-yard-line while losing, according to Stats LLC.\n\nPart of what makes these risky decisions on short fourth downs so fascinating is how many ways there are to bungle them. The Pittsburgh Steelers exemplified another type of mistake not long after the Cardinals had their turn. Down by nine with less than six minutes left in their game against the Seattle Seahawks, they punted from near midfield, presumably believing they would get two more possessions.\n\nThey didn\u2019t. And that was because the Seahawks faced the same predicament and made the opposite decision.\n\nFalcons wide receiver Julio Jones scores the game-winning touchdown against the Eagles in the fourth quarter.

But the Steelers never got the ball again since the Seahawks were willing to do what they weren\u2019t. With two minutes left, the Seahawks went for it on fourth-and-1. They converted, and then they could bleed the clock to secure the win. \u201cWe all wanted to go for it,\u201d Russell Wilson said.\n\nThe Colts faced a similar predicament in an even dicier situation. Leading the Titans 19-17 with just over two minutes left on their own 35-yard-line, they also went for it. Jacoby Brissett\u2019s successful quarterback sneak drained another minute off the clock, forced Tennessee to burn its final two timeouts and led the Colts to their first win of the season without Andrew Luck.\n\nThe day was finally capped off by the Falcons, who went for it on fourth-and-3 from their own 46 late against the Eagles. Atlanta didn\u2019t just convert. Matt Ryan hit Julio Jones for a 54-yard touchdown that won the game.\n\nThis week was also a reminder of something else: simply deciding to go for it isn\u2019t enough. Teams can make the right decision and then make the wrong decision. The Panthers went for it on fourth-and-1 three times on Thursday night against Tampa Bay. They didn\u2019t run a quarterback sneak on any of the three. They turned it over on downs all three times.\n\nVernon Hargreaves III of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers forces Christian McCaffrey of the Carolina Panthers out-of-bounds short of the first down marker on fourth down.

That happened the day before when Pittsburgh went to Penn State. Pitt had a first-and-goal behind 17-10 with 5:50 left in the fourth quarter needing one yard for a touchdown that would tie the game and get the Panthers that much closer to an enormous upset. Three plays later, they were still at the 1-yard line with 4:54 remaining in the game, and Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi made a baffling call.\n\nHe sent his kicker onto the field.\n\nIt didn\u2019t make sense in the moment, and it wasn\u2019t any less confounding in retrospect. Pitt was down by a touchdown. Why settle for a field goal?\n\n\u201cBecause you need two scores to win the football game,\u201d Narduzzi said.\n\nPitt head coach Pat Narduzzi looks on against Penn State.

Pitt still had to score a touchdown to win. By settling for a field goal, however, they were forcing themselves to get a stop on defense and score another touchdown from somewhere that was almost certainly not the 1-yard line.\n\nBut the plan backfired before it could even get that far when Pitt\u2019s kicker missed the gimme field goal from 19 yards. The Panthers managed to get the ball back with 1:39 left still down by a touchdown, and their prayers for a successful Hail Mary as time expired were ignored by the football gods. You might think that Pitt\u2019s coach regretted the strategy afterward. But here\u2019s what he said he would\u2019ve changed about his decision: nothing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t question that call,\u201d Narduzzi said.\n\nWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com and Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "description": "There\u2019s more evidence than ever that teams should be aggressive on fourth down.
