Every time it beats, it forces blood through the arteries and capillaries and around the body.\n\nBlood pressure is the measurement of this force. Two figures are relevant.\n\nThe first - the higher figure - is when the heart contracts and forces blood through the arteries.\n\nThe second - the lower figure - is when the heart relaxes between beats.\n\nBlood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury, which is written down as: mmHg.\n\nSo, when you have your blood pressure measured, it is written down as two numbers, one over the other like a fraction - 140/90mmHg, for example.\n\nThe top number, the systolic pressure, shows the pressure in your arteries when your heart is forcing blood through them.\n\nThe bottom number, the diastolic pressure, shows the pressure in your arteries when your heart relaxes.\n\nThe top number can be anywhere from 90 to 200, and the bottom number can be anywhere from 60 to 140.\n\nThe higher your blood pressure rate, the harder your heart has to work, forcing the blood through arteries which may have narrowed or become stiff.\n\nThe strain of pumping the blood at this pressure can cause vessels to become clogged or to weaken, and this can lead to narrow blood vessels and clots which can damage the heart or brain (more rarely, it can lead to the blood vessels bursting). This is what doctors call essential hypertension.\n\nA small number of people have secondary hypertension, which means there is an underlying cause of their high blood pressure.\n\nFor example, some people develop high blood pressure if they have problems with their kidneys or adrenal glands (which sit above the kidneys).\n\nThese glands produce hormones that are important in controlling blood pressure.\n\nAs well as causing heart failure and stroke, high blood pressure can also cause the kidneys to fail.\n\nWho gets high blood pressure?\n\nHigh blood pressure can affect anyone, but there are high-risk groups:\n\nIf you have a family history of high blood pressure, stroke or heart attack, you are more likely to have high blood pressure.\n\nBlack and South-East Asian people are more likely to have high blood pressure, although the reasons are not fully understood.\n\nSome other conditions are also linked to high blood pressure, such as diabetes, kidney disease and heart disease.\n\nBlood pressure goes up as we get older. At least half of all people over the age of 75 have high blood pressure.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of high blood pressure?\n\nHigh blood pressure usually has no symptoms, which is why many people do not know that they have it. For this reason, it is sometimes called the silent killer.\n\nThe only way to know is to have it measured, using a machine with a cuff around your arm.\n\nHow can high blood pressure be treated?\n\nMost people in the UK are treated at their GP's surgery, either by the doctor or practice nurse.\n\nMany surgeries have specific clinics for people with high blood pressure. A few people may need to see someone more specialised in treating blood pressure.\n\nAs well as having your blood pressure measured several times, it may be necessary for you to have some simple tests.\n\nDoctors will usually ask you about your family and medical history, take a urine and blood test and may also ask you to have a recording of the electrical activity of your heart (ECG).\n\nSome people may also have blood pressure monitoring over a 24-hour period.\n\nTreatment will depend on how high your blood pressure is and on what other 'risk factors' you have for heart disease and stroke.\n\nIf your blood pressure is between 140/90 and 160/100mmHg, you will probably be asked to make some changes to your lifestyle. These will include.\n\nCutting down on the amount of salt in your diet.\n\nEating at least five portions of fruit and vegetables every day.\n\nTaking more exercise.\n\nLosing weight (if you are overweight).\n\nCutting down on the amount of alcohol you drink (if it is more than the recommended 21 units a week for men and 14 units for women).\n\nMost people will need to take tablets only if the lifestyle changes don't work; but some people may be prescribed medication straight away.\n\nThis is more likely if you are older or have other risk factors for heart disease and stroke, such as high cholesterol, you are a smoker, or have had a previous stroke or heart attack.\n\nMany doctors encourage patients to manage their own blood pressure by monitoring themselves on a regular basis, especially if they have had a high reading in the past.\n\nYou can buy machines for measuring your blood pressure. There is a wide range available, so ask your pharmacist or GP for help if you are unsure which to buy.", "description": "Scientists from the\u00a0University of Vigo in Spain found people who took the drugs before bed had a 44% reduced risk of a heart attack compared to those who took them in the morning.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/16/20040566-0-image-a-23_1571756401909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
