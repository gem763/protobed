Thirty-eight percent of respondents said that big technology companies are a competitive threat, and 32% say the same about fintech firms. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nBanks have three primary strategies they can deploy to stay abreast of their digital challengers:\n\nDesign proprietary digital features. By creating their own digital innovations, banks can end up with bespoke features designed specifically for their systems, ensuring ease of integration. For this strategy to succeed, however, banks need to have staff they can dedicate to building these solutions, making it most appropriate for mid-sized to large banks that have the IT budgets and staff to dedicate to it. Bank of America is a sterling example of this approach: It's among the top 10 holders of US banking-related patents and applications and has been building out its virtual assistant Erica with a slew of new features.\n\nPartner with fintechs to innovate. Partnerships and strategic investments by banks in digital upstarts can be a symbiotic way for both fintechs and banks to succeed. And because such partnerships don't require banks to reassign a lot of employees or spent significant capital in many cases, this strategy is feasible for banks of any size. Metro Bank \u2014 a young high street bank launched in 2010 \u2014 epitomizes this strategy with its recent partnerships with three different fintechs to bolster its small- and medium-sized banking (SMB) offerings.\n\nAcquire digital challengers outright. If a competing startup has developed strong technology and poses a serious threat, banks can consider absorbing it to eliminate the threat completely and better their own offerings. However, this strategy can require serious capital, especially if the company to be acquired has achieved a high valuation. For that reason, larger banks are most likely to use it. A recent example of this strategy is Capital One and its August acquisition of online wealth manager United Income, which enabled the bank to quickly elevate its wealth management offering by absorbing United Income's tool that blends both technological capabilities and human advice.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
