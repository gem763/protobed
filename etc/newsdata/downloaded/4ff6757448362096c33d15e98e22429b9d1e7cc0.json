Citywide protests were held against the anti-mask law that came into effect on Saturday.\n\nDefying mask ban, tens of thousands of Hongkongers hold demonstrations over the weekend\n\nIn a WhatsApp message sent by the bureau to secondary school principals, officials said head teachers should hand over the information this morning via WhatsApp or phone. The principals were asked to make a note of students who take \u201cabnormal leave\u201d, and record any \u201cspecial incidents\u201d at school.\n\nThese include students chanting slogans, staging sit-ins, and forming human chains.\n\nThe message also said if the bureau did not receive that information by 11am today, they would call schools for details.\n\nCourt rejects second attempt to overturn mask ban, but calls for urgent hearing into opposition lawmakers' judicial challenge\n\nLast month, just after the start of the new school year, the bureau asked secondary schools for details about students boycotting classes, a source said. But since there was a \u201ccalmer atmosphere\u201d back then, the officials did not make it mandatory for schools to supply that information, until now.\n\nResponding to Young Post\u2019s inquiries, the bureau said: \u201cSince the beginning of this new school term, the bureau has been in touch with schools on a daily basis to learn about their situations, including the class boycotts and other incidents.\u201d\n\nThe aim, according to the bureau, was to provide relevant support. It also emphasised that it never had, and never would, collect any personal information.", "description": "New face mask ban will do little to stop social unrest and disturbances, says psychologist group.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/21d47488-e8d4-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4imagehires175337.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
