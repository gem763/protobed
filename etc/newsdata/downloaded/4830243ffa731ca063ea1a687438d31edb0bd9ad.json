We\u2019ll start things off with the NL Wild Card game between the Nationals and Brewers this evening. Washington RHP Max Scherzer and company are listed at -170 home favorites while facing Milwaukee RHP Brandon Woodruff in this winner-take-all contest.\n\nWe\u2019ll highlight the top picks and best bargains to assemble a cash-inducing lineup. On top of that, the \u201cadditional notes\u201d section will feature several tournament selections while adding context to the rest of this slate.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nTuesday\u2019s single-game slate begins at 8:05 ET.\n\nTOP PLAYS\n\nJuan Soto - OF - Washington\n\nSoto tops the charts as potentially one of the best hitters of the night. He\u2019ll have to fend off teammates Trea Turner and Anthony Rendon for that award, but keep in mind that Soto has a marginally cheaper salary as well. The Nationals are favored at home tonight while facing the lesser of either starting pitcher in Milwaukee\u2019s Brandon Woodruff. If you are building cash lineups, Soto checks in as a strong contender for MVP consideration.\n\nTrea Turner - SS - Washington\n\nAs mentioned in the previous write-up, Turner and Anthony Rendon (3B - WAS) can be argued as top overall picks as well. Turner can post fantasy upside from literally every category, but he admittedly holds less power than Rendon or Soto \u2026 As for Rendon, he\u2019s expensive, but you won\u2019t have to worry about him falling into lefty/lefty draws from the bullpen, unlike Soto.\n\nNOTABLE BARGAINS\n\nStory continues\n\nEric Thames - 1B - Milwaukee\n\nEven though Nationals\u2019 RHP Max Scherzer steps in as a sizable favorite, he\u2019s not exactly bulletproof. The Washington ace has surrendered nine earned runs and four homers through 12.2 innings over his past two starts. There\u2019s a chance \u201cMad Max\u201d brings his best stuff in this win or go home scenario, but we have to identify the opening for Milwaukee\u2019s power hitters. Thames is a boom-or-bust option who could pay dividends if Scherzer's homerun struggles carry into this tilt.\n\nMatt Adams / Howie Kendrick - 1B - Washington\n\nWhoever gets the start for Washington makes for an interesting bargain filler to help make the rest of your lineup work. There\u2019s some concern with Adams struggling while dealing with a shoulder injury, but his rock-bottom salary accounts for that. It only takes one swing of the bat for him to deliver fantasy upside \u2026 As for Kendrick, he has been much better lately, racking up 16 hits over his past eight starts. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he gets the start based on that hot-streak.\n\nALSO CONSIDER\n\nAdam Eaton (OF - WAS) certainly deserve cash game looks while checking in as a cheaper pivot away from teammates Soto, Rendon, and Turner. While playing around with lineups, it seems like you can only fit two of those top three recommendations under the salary cap. That\u2019s where Eaton comes in.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the Brewers, as there are some sneaky-good pivots against Scherzer\u2019s deep-ball tendencies as of late. Mike Moustakas (3B - MIL) is an excellent tournament choice to jump on that, and he\u2019s borderline cash playable as well. Yasmani Grandal (C - MIL) falls into the same rationale. He\u2019ll probably carry a lower-than-deserved ownership rate, as it\u2019s taboo to roster catchers at FLEX positions. However, Grandal has the necessary power to deliver, and the fact that he\u2019s a switch-hitter doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\nRyan Braun (OF - MIL) is 0-14 in his career against Scherzer. That will translate to an extremely low ownership rate in tournaments, meaning we have a leverage opportunity with the Milwaukee veteran. As mentioned earlier, it only takes one swing of the bat, and Braun could deliver in the late innings against Washington\u2019s bullpen as well.", "description": "Spencer Limbach runs through the MLB DFS Single Game slate for the NL Wild Card between Washington and Milwaukee.
