Joe Biden had attempted to inject some sanity in the Democratic debate over gun control by noting that presidents don\u2019t have the authority in the Constitution to order seizures of firearms and banning guns. Harris, a former AG, literally laughed off that concern when ABC News anchor David Muir asked her about it:\n\nThe most depressing part about tonight's #DemocraticDebate is when @KamalaHarris replied to @JoeBiden's claim that her proposed exec order would be unconstitutional by *laughing* and blithely saying \"instead of saying no we can't, how about yes we can\" and listing Very Bad Things pic.twitter.com/32RboFItXL \u2014 Ari Cohn (@AriCohn) September 13, 2019\n\nMUIR: In recent days former Vice President Biden has said about executive orders, \u201cSome really talented people are seeking the nomination. They said \u2018I\u2019m going to issue an executive order.'\u201d Biden saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say \u2018I\u2019m going to eliminate assault weapons,'\u201d saying, \u201cyou can\u2019t do it by executive order any more than Trump can do things when he says he can do it by executive order.\u201d Does the vice president have a point there? BIDEN: Some things you can. Many things you can\u2019t. MUIR: Let\u2019s let the senator answer. HARRIS: Well, I mean, I would just say, hey, Joe, instead of saying, no, we can\u2019t, let\u2019s say yes, we can. BIDEN: Let\u2019s be constitutional. We\u2019ve got a Constitution.\n\nHow would Harris derive that power? Because she\u2019s seen autopsy photos and hugged mothers, which are other heretofore unknown clauses of the Constitution, it seems:\n\nHARRIS: And yes, we can, because I\u2019ll tell you something. The way that I think about this is, I\u2019ve seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you. I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you.\n\nPerhaps we should stop worrying about Biden\u2019s cognitive issues and start worrying about the rest of the field. At least Biden tried injecting some realism into the debate and attempted to stop his competitors from promising the impossible. In this exchange, Harris sounds like the kid running for student body president who promises to negotiate longer lunch periods and easier grades for everyone.\n\nThat\u2019s the more humorous take on this. More seriously, Harris is campaigning for a dictatorship rather than president. Democrats have screeched about Trump undermining the rule of law, and perhaps not without some justification, but here Harris scoffs at the very idea of limited powers and adherence to the core law of the US in the Constitution. Her personal privilege outweighs the law, Harris argues. And she\u2019s not the only one arguing that when it comes to gun control, either.\n\nHarris might laugh off the law. The rest of us can\u2019t afford to do so.", "description": "Laughable.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/biden-harris-warren.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
