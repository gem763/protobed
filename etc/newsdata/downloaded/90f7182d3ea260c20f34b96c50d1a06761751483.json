The pound had fallen precipitously Tuesday after alleged details of that phone called were published.\n\nJohnson will meet with his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, in Dublin Thursday. The British and Irish prime ministers remain wide apart on the potential for technological solutions that the U.K. side says will obviate the need for physical customs checks and border infrastructure on the dividing line between the Irish republic and the separate nation of Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom.", "description": "Germany's finance minister has said the EU and U.K. have a \"common responsibility\" to negotiate a settlement to govern Britain's departure from Europe.", "authors": ["Willem Marx"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106159952-1570014158910gettyimages-1173062887.jpeg?v=1570080350", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
