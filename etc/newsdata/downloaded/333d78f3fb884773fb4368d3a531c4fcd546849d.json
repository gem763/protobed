The new system includes multiple voice-activated microphones in the upper torso of the suit that automatically pick up their voices.\n\nThe suits will also be custom fitted to the astronauts. The future spacewalkers will undergo 3D scans to get measurements that will \"provide the most comfort and the broadest range of motion, while reducing the potential for skin irritation where the suit might press on the body.\"\n\nNASA IS READY TO TEST ITS FIRST ALL-ELECTRIC EXPERIMENTAL X-PLANE: 'A SIGNIFICANT EVENT'\n\nNews of the custom space suits comes after a suit-sizing flap that led to an embarrassing cancellation earlier this month.\n\nAnd should nature call, NASA has thought of that, too, with the new suits.\n\nAstronauts \"will still wear a diaper-like garment during spacewalks that is a combination of commercial products stitched together for maximum absorption,\" the space agency added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "NASA is making preparations for sending humans back to the Moon by 2024 and in doing so, has shown off the latest spacesuits that astronauts will wear on their return trip.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/nasa-new-spacesuit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
