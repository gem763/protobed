We lived a stable life in a two-bedroom flat which we owned, and we felt more than ready to start a loving family. We had spoken to other gay parents who had been through the lengthy process of adoption and so we were aware of the challenges ahead. We knew many children had suffered abuse and neglect; we understood that some had learning difficulties and behavioural problems. But our hearts were open to loving any child who was placed with us, no matter what their past life.\n\nDuring a two-hour home visit, the two social workers assigned to our case grilled us about why we wanted to be parents, delved into our family histories and probed us on our relationship. I explained how my brother was adopted, how he has a successful career and is happily married with two children of his own. I suggested he might be a good role model for our child. My husband recounted his own upbringing in Vietnam, recalling how after the war he was separated from his parents who passed away while fleeing the country. He then emigrated to Australia as a child with his grandparents. They treated him as their own son and provided a loving home. The experience taught him the importance of kindness and empathy for other adopted children.\n\nSurely all this valuable experience would be stand in our favour? Not in the slightest.\n\nEvery positive story we told of our lives was turned against us. During that terrible phone call, the social worker insisted I didn\u2019t understand my brother\u2019s trauma at being adopted. My husband in turn apparently hadn\u2019t come to terms with his own tumultuous childhood.\n\nBut the real sticking point? We didn\u2019t have any experience looking after children. Volunteer at a nursery, she suggested. Read a book, she urged. It sounded like a ludicrous reason to turn us down. After all, most new parents have had little or no experience raising children. That doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t.\n\nIt felt like excuses to cross us off a long list of hopefuls waiting to adopt. After all, we had been told at a local authority information evening that adoptive parents outnumbered children two to one. As I came to terms with the decision, I accept that give the numbers we really didn\u2019t stand much of a chance.\n\nSo I was shocked and angry to discover, this week, that the opposite is true: there are in fact twice as many children as parents to adopt. How could it be? We were applying in London, so perhaps the national statistics are not reflective of the capital\u2019s situation. However, the message from the adoption services at the time was loud and clear. If you want to adopt a child, you better get in line.\n\nWe were told over and over again how long and difficult the process will be, how we will be required to write an autobiography about our lives, listing every single trauma we experienced in detail. Then we were reminded of the types of children put up for adoption: babies born with brain damage as a result of their mother\u2019s drug addiction, or children simply neglected and abused. It is vital that prospective parents know the facts and what to expect should they choose this option, but there was so little emphasis on the positive. What joy and fulfilment will adopting a child bring? How will it change your life and the child\u2019s for the better?\n\nPerhaps they were trying to separate the wheat from the chaff. Find out who was really serious about the challenges of adopting. But I can\u2019t help feeling that in the process they were scaring away some potentially fantastic parents who could provide a loving home for a child in need.\n\nYes, parents should be educated about the challenges ahead but not so terrified by the mountain they will have to climb that never make it past base camp. Support and encouragement is what's needed to see more children in care moved safely into loving, adoptive homes, not scare tactics.\n\nPerhaps we were somewhat naive about the demands of raising an adopted child, but what I regret is that we were never given the chance to rise to that challenge. Snap judgements made based on very little evidence ended our adoption journey before it had really begun.\n\nOf course we could reapply after six months, but the experience had left us bruised and wounded. We couldn\u2019t face another round. Adoption wasn\u2019t going to be our path to parenthood, after all.\n\nTogether, my husband and I picked ourselves up and searched for other avenues. Now, three years later, we have two beautiful children through surrogacy \u2013 a three year old girl and a one year old boy. I\u2019ve rocked them to sleep, wiped the tears and their bottoms, and held their hands down the street like I always dreamed I would. Through the rough and the smooth, I\u2019ve never looked back.", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you don\u2019t have enough childcare experience to adopt\u201d.
