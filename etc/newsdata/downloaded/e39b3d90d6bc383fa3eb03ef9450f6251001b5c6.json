'We have not slept. And you know what she lost.'\n\nAlpha swiveled her head, snakelike, toward Carol, saying: 'I forgive you. Mother to mother.'\n\nThen she threw in a caveat, adding: 'This is my land now. You'd better run.'\n\nCarol fled with her fellow survivors to the woods, determined to kill 'that b****', but her addiction to pills was putting her in equally great danger.\n\nTaunting remark: Alpha taunted Carole and said Henry screamed her name before they took his head off\n\nThat night, Carol swore she saw Whisperers in the forest, believing they were out for blood.\n\nYet no one else saw them, and doubted the veracity of her story.\n\n'No sign of them anywhere,' Michonne relayed after searching for the invaders. 'No traces, no tracks, anything.'\n\nThe leader: The leader of the Whisperers punished the survivors for crossing the border\n\n'How long you been taking those pills for?' she asked Carol [Melissa McBride].\n\n'Since I got back,' Carol snapped. 'It's fine. They're like coffee.'\n\nIt would later turn out that she was right about the Whisperers, but the hallucinations remained nonetheless.\n\nNo sleep: The survivors were sleep deprived after fighting off walkers for more than 40 straight hours\n\nHaunted by Henry's death, Carol stayed awake for entire days, struggling with exhaustion, trauma and stress.\n\nIt was something she shared with the rest of the survivors in the season 10 episode, entitled Ghosts.\n\nAs day dawned at Alexandria, they fell under attack from steady streams of the undead.\n\nUnder attack: Walkers approached from different directions\n\nFor more than 30 hours, they fought back, defending their territory and trying to stay alive.\n\n'They keep coming from every direction of the border,' puzzled Aaron [Ross Marquand], who grappled with what to do. 'It's just constant, wave after wave.'\n\nWhisperer messenger Gamma [Thora Birch] approached them, and said to meet Alpha at the border.\n\nThe messenger: Gamma approached their camp and said to meet Alpha at the border\n\nNearly everyone thought Alpha orchestrated the attack, as they'd recently broached her boundaries while putting out a forest fire from a fallen satellite.\n\n'It wasn't her,' Alpha's daughter Lydia [Cassidy McClincy] countered. 'If she wanted you dead, she'd send the horde, all of it. Not a few waves at a time.'\n\n'If she sends that horde, that's it,' Michonne pointed out. 'Right now, all she wants to do is talk, and we are going to listen.'\n\nNot her: Alpha's daughter Lydia said her mother wasn't behind the walkers attacking\n\nMichonne posted Gabriel Stokes [Seth Gilliam] at the north gate, with Aaron to the south, where he was reluctantly paired with Negan [Jeffrey Dean Morgan].\n\nThat night, the seven chief survivors met with Alpha, laying down their weapons first.\n\n'There is one rule between our people,' Alpha intoned. 'Stay where you are.'\n\nWeapons down: Daryl Dixon and a group of survivor leaders dropped their weapons before meeting Alpha\n\nThe survivors had crossed her borders three times, she said, and that merited punishment.\n\nShe would forgo it if they retracted their border, ceding control of their hunting ground.\n\n'We don't have to stand here and listen to this bulls***,' said Carol, shooting at Alpha.\n\nSecret gun: Carol hid a gun and tried to shoot Alpha as Michonne moved to stop her\n\n'The bitch needs to die,' Carol told Michonne afterward, deep in the woods.\n\nTo Michonne, Daryl privately opined that Carol hadn't been 'right' for some time.\n\nIn the distance, Carol saw Whisperers creep by her, and shot at them.\n\nNo one else saw them, so the survivors holed up at a nearby school, where Michonne wondered if the pills made Carol hallucinate, and Daryl noted she was sleep-deprived.\n\nSeeing things: Carol was taking pills to stay awake and was starting to hallucinate\n\n'You stay up that long, you start seeing things,' he told Carol, explaining that the same thing once happened to his father, a truck driver.\n\nCarol took the last pill in her bottle and slept, dreaming of Henry calling for her.\n\nDaryl found her as she woke, worrying because she'd been gone for 30 minutes.\n\nCrazy dreams: The lack of sleep from taking pills was causing Carol to see things and when she did sleep she dreamed of Henry\n\nCarol replied that she was fine, that she wasn't like his dad, the truck driver.\n\n'My dad wasn't a truck driver,' he told her, looking at her strangely.\n\nCarol realized she'd never taken that last pill, and so took one, over Daryl's protests.\n\nAlone in the school's gym, she stepped into a trap and was flipped upside-down.\n\nWorried friend: Daryl told Michonne that he was worried about Carol taking pills\n\nAs she dangled, a throng of walkers descended, led by Gamma, whom she tried to stab.\n\nCarol then cut herself down, falling on a shard of glass, and massacred the undead.\n\nBack at camp, Siddiq [Avi Nash] patched her up and fought his own flashbacks of Alpha.\n\nOn watch: Carole took her last pill while on watch at the school\n\nSurprise attack: Walkers attacked Carol after she was caught in a trap\n\nPrivate struggle: Back at camp, Siddiq [Avi Nash] patched her up and fought his own flashbacks of Alpha\n\nChecking in: Michonne checked in on Siddiq\n\nNegan and Aaron were also out fighting, and squabbling, that day.\n\n'I did what I had to do back then,' said Negan, whose Saviors once killed Aaron's boyfriend.\n\n'Tell me why the love of my life had to die,' Aaron implored.\n\nIn charge: Aaron was in charge of protecting an area with Negan\n\n'Ok,' Negan acquiesced. 'One simple fact. One truth kept my people going: If you don't protect what belongs to you, sooner or later it belongs to someone else.'\n\n'That goes for your land, your wallet, your home, your country\u2014everything,' he added. 'It is your job as a man to protect it. That's the story of America\u2026 and ain't nothing changing it.'\n\n'Are you saying that Eric's death was my fault?' Aaron asked, swallowing hard. 'If I failed Eric, then you failed your wife. She died hating you. And you will never see her again.'\n\nConstant squabbling: Negan at one point appeared to challenge Aaron's authority, but later saved him from walkers\n\nWalkers suddenly attacked Aaron from behind, and he fought them off, stabbing one covered in hogweed, which temporarily blinded him.\n\nUnable to see, he stumbled after Negan, who was then forced to save Aaron from two new walkers, whacking them with a tire iron that Aaron had insisted he discard.\n\nEugene Porter [Josh McDermitt] and Rosita Espinosa [Christian Serratos] fought more walkers together.\n\nLooking out: Eugene Porter used binoculars to look for walkers\n\nLarge herd: Herds of walkers kept coming in waves\n\nWhen Eugene told Rosita he wanted to protect her and baby Coco, she went ballistic.\n\n'You and I are never going to happen,' she emphasized. 'You are not Coco's father. We are not together. I need you to hear that.'\n\nEugene reeled, waking up at last to what she'd been trying to tell him.\n\nNever happening: Rosita made it clear to Eugene that they were never going to be together\n\nHe admitted that he'd hoped he would someday change her mind.\n\nCoco's father, Siddiq, was off having a drink with fellow doctor Dante [Juan Javier Cardenas].\n\nDante, a former field medic in Iraq, had experience with war and trauma.\n\n'You go in one person, you come out different,' he related.\n\nDante recalled a 'broad-shouldered' Adonis he once knew, who lost his squad in Fallujah, and came back with 'the shakes, a thousand-mile stare, the flashbacks, going in and out of VAs.'\n\n'What happened to him?' Siddiq asked.\n\nWar story: Doctor Dante told Siddiq about his experience with war and trauma\n\n'You're looking at him,' Dante replied.\n\nUpstairs, recovering, Carol dreamed that Daryl cooked breakfast for her and Henry.\n\nWhen she awoke, she encountered Michonne, who asked her how she felt.\n\n'Hurts,' Carol said. 'Being back here hurts, too. And that's her fault,' she added, referring to Alpha. 'You shouldn't have stopped me.'\n\nStill hurting: Carol was still hurting after being rescued\n\n'There were seven of us out there,' Michonne explained. 'I had to think of them.'\n\n'I know,' Carol recognized. 'But I did see them.'\n\nMichonne looked at her sadly, saying, 'Only you did.'\n\nCarol walked outside and found Daryl, noting, 'She doesn't believe me. Do you?'\n\n'Yeah,' Daryl shared, as the camera tracked into the nearby forest and caught a Whisperer waking up.\n\nThe Walking Dead will return next week on AMC.", "description": "Carol Peletier tried to kill Alpha on Sunday night's episode of The Walking Dead as she sought revenge for the death of her adopted son, Henry.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/08/19979544-0-image-a-179_1571641512834.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
