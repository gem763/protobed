Along with free two-day shipping and an entertainment streaming service, the company is now offering another reward to members: free grocery delivery.\n\nStarting today, grocery delivery from Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods will now be included in the cost of the Prime membership. Previously, the service was an additional $14.99 per month on top of the Prime membership fee. \"Grocery delivery is one of the fastest-growing businesses at Amazon, and we think this will be one of the most-loved Prime benefits,\" says Stephenie Landry, vice president of Amazon grocery delivery, in a news release.\n\nSmith Collection, Gado, Getty Images\n\nThe e-grocery delivery service, which transports produce, meat, snacks, and basically everything you can find at a grocery store, is currently available in more than 2,000 cities and Amazon reveals it's planning to expand the service to more towns soon. The online retailer is also improving delivery speed by offering members one- and two-hour delivery windows in most cities.\n\nFor those already paying for grocery delivery, you'll be able to take advantage of the offer right away by going to Amazon's website or logging into the app. The company will no longer charge you for the service. However, if you currently don't have the option added to your membership, you'll need to request an invitation to use it. Although Amazon hasn't disclosed an expected timeline, the company said it will alert those individuals when it's available.\n\nRelated: You Can Now Pick a Delivery Day for Your Amazon Packages\u2014And Be Green While Doing It\n\nFast, free grocery delivery is always useful, but with the holidays quickly approaching, it could be a major helping hand. Instead of making multiple last-minute trips to the store (which seem inevitable no matter how much you plan), you can kick up your feet, relax, and watch your favorite holiday movie.", "description": "The service is currently available to more than 2,000 cities and will be expanding soon.", "authors": ["Jennifer Aldrich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sIl8ph3iLohHMQseEbeUAQ--~B/aD0xMjQ0O3c9MTk4MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/better_homes_gardens_articles_518/d9e607b9d69723855e1458a90f022cda", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
