But the new numbers suggest that fears of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown may be a more significant factor in the slippage.\n\nOverall, the number of uninsured in the U.S. rose by 1.9 million people in 2018, the agency report this past week. It was the first jump in nearly a decade. An estimated 27.5 million people, or 8.5% of the population, lacked coverage the entire year. Such increases are considered unusual in a strong economy.\n\nThe report showed that a drop in low-income people enrolled in Medicaid was the most significant factor behind the higher number of uninsured people.\n\nHispanics were the only major racial and ethnic category with a significant increase in their uninsured rate. It rose by 1.6 percentage points in 2018, with nearly 18% lacking coverage. There was no significant change in health insurance for non-Hispanic whites, blacks and Asians.\n\n\u201cSome of the biggest declines in coverage are coming among Latinos and noncitizens,\u201d said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, who tracks trends in health insurance coverage. \u201cThese declines in coverage are coming at a time when the Trump administration has tried to curb immigration and discourage immigrants from using public benefits like Medicaid.\u201d\n\nHealth care is the defining issue for Democrats vying for their party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination. Candidates wasted no time in Thursday\u2019s debate highlighting the split between progressives such as Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren , who favor a government-run system for all, including people without legal permission to be in the country, and moderates like former Vice President Joe Biden. He supports building on the Affordable Care Act and adding a new public plan option, open to U.S. citizens and legal residents.\n\nAlthough the candidates did not dwell on the uninsured rate, Democratic congressional leaders have said the census figures show the administration\u2019s \u201csabotage\u201d of the Obama health law.\n\nThe administration issued a statement blaming the law\u2019s high premiums, unaffordable for solid middle-class people who do not qualify for financial assistance. \u201cThe reality is we will continue to see the number of uninsured increase until we address the underlying issues in Obamacare that have failed the American people,\u201d the statement said.\n\nPatterns in the data indicate there\u2019s more to the story.\n\nHealth economist Richard Frank of Harvard Medical School said the data \u201csuggest that we are dealing with immigration \u2026 potentially in some unexpected ways.\u201d Frank was a high-ranking health policy adviser in the Obama administration.\n\nThe uninsured rate for foreign-born people, including those who have become U.S. citizens, also rose significantly, mirroring the shift among Hispanics.\n\nFrank noted that immigrant families often include foreign-born and native-born relatives, \u201cand you can imagine the new approach to immigration inhibiting these people from doing things that would make them more visible to public authorities,\u201d such as applying for government health care programs.\n\nImmigrants\u2019 fears may also be part of the reason for a significant increase in the number of uninsured children in 2018, said Katherine Hempstead, a senior health policy expert with the nonpartisan Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which works to expand coverage. Among immigrant children who have become citizens, the uninsured rate rose by 2.2 percentage points in 2018, to 8.6%. The increase was greater among kids who are not citizens.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of kids eligible for public coverage but not enrolled because of various things that make it less comfortable for people to enroll in public coverage,\u201d said Hempstead.\n\nThe administration\u2019s \u201cpublic charge\u201d regulation, which could deny green cards to migrants who use government benefits such as Medicaid was finalized this year. But other efforts to restrict immigration, including family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border, were occurring in the period covered by the report.\n\n\u201cPeople are interpreting \u2018public charge\u2019 broadly and even though their kids are eligible for Medicaid because they were born in this country, they are staying away,\u201d said Hempstead. Children\u2019s coverage often follows their parents\u2019 status.\n\nOther factors could also be affecting the numbers:\n\n-The report found a statistically significant increase in solid middle-class people who are uninsured. Health care researcher and consultant Brian Blase, who until recently served as a White House adviser, said it appears to reflect people who cannot afford high ACA premiums. Blase said Trump policies rolled out last year should provide better options for this group. The changes include short-term health insurance plans, health reimbursement accounts and association health plans.\n\n-Experts are debating the impact of a strong job market on the decline in Medicaid enrollment. It\u2019s possible that some Medicaid recipients took jobs that boosted their earnings, making them ineligible for benefits. But if those jobs did not provide health benefits, then the workers would become uninsured. The Census Bureau report showed no significant change in workplace coverage.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When the Census Bureau reported an increase in the number of people without health insurance in America, it sent political partisans reaching for talking points on the Obama-era health law and its travails.
