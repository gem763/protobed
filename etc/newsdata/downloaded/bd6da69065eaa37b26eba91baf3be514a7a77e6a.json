It said pre-production had already started and production on the series would begin in the city of Auckland over the coming months.\n\n\u201cAs we searched for the location in which we could bring to life the primordial beauty of the Second Age of Middle-earth, we knew we needed to find somewhere majestic, with pristine coasts, forests, and mountains,\u201d showrunners and executive producers J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay wrote in a statement.\n\nBut Amazon wouldn\u2019t reveal the extent of its plans for the series. It declined to say how much it plans to spend, how many seasons the show will run, or when it will debut.\n\nSome have speculated Amazon could spend more than $1 billion on the series as it looks to take on other streaming services like Netflix with its Prime Video service.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s Economic Development Minister Phil Twyford welcomed the news, saying the series would give a boost to the screen industry and create hundreds of new jobs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hugely significant piece of popular culture,\u201d Twyford said. \u201cAnd it now has a special place in New Zealanders hearts as well. We are part of Middle-earth.\u201d\n\nThe series will be eligible for a 20% screen grant rebate that will be funded by taxpayers. The conservative lobby group Taxpayers\u2019 Union said the rebate meant every New Zealand household could end up paying more than $100.\n\n\u201cWho would seriously name Amazon as the most deserving recipient of our hard-earned tax dollars?\u201d the group wrote in a release.\n\nBut Twyford said it will be money well spent.\n\n\u201cThis is not a charity issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about bringing jobs, investment, and economic development to New Zealand.\u201d\n\nThe series will be based on the fantasy novels by J.R.R. Tolkien. Amazon said it would explore new story lines that precede \u201cThe Fellowship of the Ring.\u201d\n\nThe show won\u2019t be connected with the New Line Cinema movies, although Jackson has previously said he\u2019d be interested in helping out. \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d movie trilogy and \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d movie trilogy combined grossed nearly $6 billion at the box office.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Amazon announced Wednesday it will film its upcoming television series \"The Lord of the Rings\" in New Zealand, marking a return of the orcs, elves and hobbits to the country they became synonymous with over the course of six movies directed by Peter Jackson.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Nick Perry"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
