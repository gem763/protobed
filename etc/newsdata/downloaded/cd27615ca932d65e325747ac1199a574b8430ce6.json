Good luck with that.", "language": "en", "text": "The request comes after Giuliani made his usual Sunday rounds to push Trump\u2019s interests. On ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d he defended his scandal-mongering on behalf of the president over Ukraine, the center of a full-blown scandal that crystallized over the past week. Giuliani has attempted to convince the country that when Joe Biden served as vice president, he sought and secured the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor \u2014 Viktor Shokin \u2014 who was pursuing a case against an energy company, Burisma Holdings, where his son Hunter Biden served on the board of directors. As the New York Times reported in May \u2014 and other outlets have confirmed \u2014 there\u2019s no evidence to that effect. In fact, the reporting points in the other direction \u2014 that Joe Biden was acting in accordance with an international consensus, not to mention a well-cemented position within the U.S. government and that Shokin wasn\u2019t actively pursuing Burisma at the time in any case.\n\nAs Giuliani put forth his arguments, ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos tried to confine him to the facts. That was hard. Example:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: OK, you -- you've gotten those charges out there. Let\u2019s talk about -- GIULIANI: No, no, I haven\u2019t gotten them out there. STEPHANOPOULOS: But you have gotten them out there. GIULIANI: No, I haven\u2019t.\n\nHuh? Giuliani has been all over cable news, all over the networks, all over The Hill and other outlets. In an insta-famous interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, Giuliani insta-contradicted himself, one moment saying that he didn\u2019t ask Ukraine to investigate Biden, then next moment affirming that he had indeed.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Cuomo or Stephanopoulos or CBS News\u2019s Margaret Brennan, all of Giuliani\u2019s interviewers prepare themselves for his tacks, his evasions, his falsehoods. On this front, the Biden campaign\u2019s letter credits the news organizations: \u201cWhile you have been aggressive in pushing back on him in real time, it is well known that the dedicated liar always has the advantage, pushing out outlandish falsehoods and disinformation in the knowledge that it is hard for the corrections to catch up,\u201d notes the letter from the Biden campaign.\n\nIn this vein, the Biden letter merges with a million pleas from social media users dating to the onset of the Trump presidential period. This crowd pleaded with cable-news networks, particularly CNN, to scale back live broadcasts of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign rallies; they spoke up again over Sean Spicer\u2019s lie-heavy White House briefings, as well as those of his successor, Sarah Sanders; they shouted down the falsehoods so routinely spouted by Trump surrogates wherever they popped up on television. And, of course, they spoke up about the president himself, whose penchant for lies and stray falsehoods outpaced the frantic efforts of well-meaning journalists scouring source documents.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNone of it has worked. The commitment of mainstream news outlets to shop for input from both sides \u2014 no matter the ethical failings of one \u2014 is decades old. Executives in TV news have grown gray swearing by this maxim, one that had never been meaningfully challenged before the accession of Trump. The perils of this approach, by contrast, are just a few years in the making. Though the Trump period feels old and tired and rote, its core challenge to journalism is still fresh.\n\nThe Biden campaign letter is a well-phrased appeal that will in all likelihood go nowhere. Interviews with Giuliani, after all, begin with viral potential that most segments don\u2019t pack. Cuomo\u2019s tete-a-tete with the Trump lawyer this month, for example, will fit nicely into his career highlights. Swearing off a guest of this sort won\u2019t happen just because he befouls your network\u2019s air. To take a quote from the Biden campaign letter: \u201cGiuliani is not enlightening your viewers in any way. He\u2019s not offering a unique or informed perspective.\u201d\n\nAs if those have ever been booking criteria for TV news outlets.\n\nRead more:\n\nHenry Olsen: Giuliani has got to go\n\nGreg Sargent: New revelations on Trump call and Giuliani make impeachment more likely\n\nJosh Rogin: The White House\u2019s Ukraine memo destroys Giuliani\u2019s attempts to frame the State Department\n\nAlexandra Petri: Rudy Giuliani defends other people\n\nAnn Telnaes: How far Rudy Giuliani has fallen\n\nAD", "description": "\"Giuliani is not enlightening your viewers in any way.
