The NNSA budgeted between $7.3 and $9.5 billion for B61 refurbishment. But the failure of the capacitor could cost both projects up to $1 billion combined, USNI reports. The W88 is used with Trident II D5 submarine-launched ballistic missile, and an inert B61-12 gravity bomb was dropped from a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber in March.\n\nInstead of using the $5 capacitor, the NNSA will use capacitors built to its requirements, which will cost $75 per unit.\n\nDespite the delays, Verdon believes that the entire upgrade program will come out in the balance, according to Defense News, because the program has a cushion of funding for delays, and the setbacks from the W88 and B61-12 upgrades will yield \"design simplifications\" for upcoming refurbishments to the 80-4 and W87-1, decreasing costs in the long run.\n\nBut in terms of readiness for near-term deployments, it's not clear how the forces will be affected by the delay. The US Strategic Command (STRATCOM) and the Navy are working together to determine the effect of the delay, USNI reports.\n\nInsider reached out to the Navy's strategic systems programs, as well as STRATCOM, regarding short-term mission readiness. The Navy did not respond to request for comment, and STRATCOM was unable to give answers to the questions by publication time. The NNSA was unable to furnish answers to Insider's questions on Thursday.", "description": "A $5 capacitor was tested for use in Navy and Air Force nuclear weapons, but it didn't offer a long-term fix.", "authors": ["Ellen Ioanes"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8d03252e22af660c383666-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
