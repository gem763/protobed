In a sworn statement, the family described the baby being forced to sleep on a \"filthy concrete floor\" in \"frigid temperatures\" during their first night in custody.\n\nThe family said they crossed the border accidentally on October 3, after making a \"very brief detour on an unmarked road to avoid an animal on the road\" that landed them in the United States.\n\nHowever, two senior US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials dispute that claim.\n\nOne senior official told CNN that by all appearances on the ground, the family was trying to get into the US undetected, despite their claims. The official also said the group had $16,000 in cash on them.\n\nRead More", "description": "A British family has filed a complaint with the the Department of Homeland Security over their detention by US immigration officials after crossing the US border while vacationing in British Columbia, Canada earlier this month, the family's lawyers said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Geneva Sands", "Carma Hassan", "Chuck Johnston", "Miguel Marquez", "Linh Tran", "Ivana Kottasov\u00e1"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190920163236-ice-officer-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
