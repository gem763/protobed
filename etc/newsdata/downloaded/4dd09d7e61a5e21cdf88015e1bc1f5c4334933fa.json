The problem I had was that I would drink a lot of beer through the pure boredom .\n\n\"During this period at home alone, I would have one beer and then two, then three and it escalated and it spiralled quickly.\n\n\"I did sleep rough as a generalisation. When drunk, I would miss the last train out of Charing Cross station and then sleep rough outside it infrequently.\n\n\"I look back now and that was very dangerous. I also once slipped over and cracked my head open.\"\n\n(Image: Rat Race)\n\nJames, who lives in Harrow, northwest London, became frustrated by his sudden loss of routine and downed up to 10 pints each day for around two years.\n\nHe added: \"I have always a big drinker socially. I have always had a problem in that most people will have four or five drinks with friends and say 'I feel a bit tipsy' and say 'that is enough' but for some reason my brain doesn't have that switch.\n\n\"Routine is incredibly important to me. Rugby gave me that routine. My week was geared towards that Saturday afternoon match, and then I'd train and eat healthily for the next match.\n\n\"Losing that routine as well as losing that camaraderie in going out with my rugby teammates afterwards was difficult.\"\n\n(Image: Rat Race)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nBut since his traumatic fight with addiction between the February 2013 accident and April 2015, James has transformed his life with simple goals.\n\nDespite being at his worst ebb, he was inspired to train for the 2017 London Marathon, conquered the test and has since reached the final of the gruelling SAS: Who Dares Wins challenge.\n\nJames, originally from Tonbridge, Kent, is this year running 2019km in various stints and has already exceeded 900km.\n\nHe said: \"Consultants told me not to continue [playing]. I was quite close to near paralysis because I had crushed discs between the vertebrae. I was lucky to walk away from the accident.\n\n\"But I was told by specialists and physios I was able to do the marathon and other challenges if I cared for my body and trained in moderation.\"\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nHe continued: \"I watched the 2016 London Marathon on TV and it just hit me. This was the jolt I needed to turn my life around, so to speak.\n\n\"I find it hard to motivate myself if I don't have specific goals in mind. So after two to three years drinking heavily, I saw these people pushing themselves to their limits, their incredible limits and thought 'I should do that'.\n\n\"Over the next year, I set myself manageable targets, that way you can break any goal down. That goal-orientated mentality is very important to me.\n\n\"Having broken my neck and everything else, I am very interested in how the body is very fragile but you can also achieve great things with it.\n\n\"I am still interested in pushing myself further. That is quite philosophical but interesting. I am aware of my body and to take care of my body.\"\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nAnd remarkably, James reached the last eight in the final of the Channel 4 SAS contest, in which ex-Special Forces soldier Ant Middleton pits contestants against harsh environments across the world that replicate gruelling tasks in military selection processes.\n\nHe also hasn't had any alcohol since April 2016 as he plans more endurance tests.\n\nBut the PR guru is one of millions of Brits who have admitted to \"self-medicating\" their mental health in the past.\n\nAlarming research released recently by LifeSearch shows 21% of over 16s in the UK are currently using alcohol or over-the-counter and illegal drugs to cope with mental health challenges.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nJames, who lives with his long-term girlfriend, continued: \"The SAS show involves the absolute pinnacle of military courses across the world.\n\n\"The SAS recruits are whittled down. They cull people at various points. I got down to one of the last eight on that final day.\n\n\"Fitness is incredibly good for your health, especially mental health, but doing the same routine every day can be boring and meticulous. The key is to vary it in my opinion.\n\n\"Addiction and vices are fascinating but in my opinion we are all addicted to something. It is only a problem when you are not being true to yourself. I became addicted to being sober. I still haven't drank since that day in 2016.\n\n\"This is corny but Winston Churchill once said 'If you are going through hell, keep going.' I believe in that.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: James Gwinnett, who lives in Harrow, northwest London, became dependent on alcohol for years after injuries from playing rugby \"changed his life\"", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Bruce Elliott Photography", "Rat Race", "Channel", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16632749.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_James-Gwinnett.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
