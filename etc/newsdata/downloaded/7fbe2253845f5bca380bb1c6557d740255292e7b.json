The Strategic Long-Range Cannon (SLRC), which could reach well over 1,000 miles, represents a key piece of the Pentagon\u2019s push for more advanced artillery capable of targeting enemy positions from distances that were once unimaginable.\n\nThe cannon, which the Army hopes to test by 2023, is part of the Pentagon\u2019s broader effort to install \u201clong-range precision fires\u201d in potential battlefields around the world. The technology behind the SLRC remains in development, but Army officials said bringing such weapons into the arsenal is critical as the military prepares for the next era of warfare.\n\nIn an ironic twist, the quest for a modern longer-range artillery piece also marks a return to an earlier era for today\u2019s modern militaries. \u201cSuper-guns\u201d were eagerly developed by the powers drawn into World War I, and Adolf Hitler pushed Nazi scientists (unsuccessfully) to develop a V-3 \u201cSuper Cannon\u201d to target London from bases across the English Channel.\n\n\u201cIf you look at doctrinally how the U.S. military uses long-range fires to shoot and then maneuver \u2026 it\u2019s one of the most important capabilities that we have as an entire Department of Defense,\u201d Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told The Washington Times in an interview last week.\n\nSuch weapons, he said, can \u201creverse the paradigm\u201d for potential adversaries who are now spending heavily on capabilities to deny U.S. forces access to key areas and battlefields and who may have control of the airspace above certain future battlefields, Mr. McCarthy said.\n\nIndeed, China has put a heavy priority on a strategy known in military circles as anti-access and area denial (A2AD). Such a policy \u2014 a combination of defensive systems, artillery, radar and other tools \u2014 seeks to deny an enemy the ability to occupy or move through a specific area of land, air or sea.\n\nThe strategy, specialists say, would be vital if Chinese forces mount a full-scale invasion of Taiwan and need to keep American forces from coming to the island\u2019s aid. If executed correctly, the A2AD approach could keep U.S. ships, planes, drones and ground forces away from the fight.\n\nArms race\n\nResearchers say China is trying to ramp up its A2AD strategy even further by incorporating Russian-made S-400 missile defense systems and other weapons that could slow down or even halt the U.S. ability to move planes and ships across the Pacific.\n\n\u201cChina continues to improve its area denial capabilities and reports speculate that the country plans to acquire improved S-400 air defense systems from Russia for deployment in the region,\u201d the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance says on its website. \u201cAnti-satellite weapons are also believed to be employed by China to maintain A2/AD in the Asia-Pacific, and would be used to disrupt or even completely deny U.S. satellite communication and GPS capabilities.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials say that\u2019s where long-range precision guns could play a huge role by providing a high-tech version of artillery-covering fire. They theoretically would be able to target areas that ships and planes simply couldn\u2019t reach, giving U.S. forces a relatively safe and effective way to fight back.\n\n\u201cThat integrated system challenges even our most sophisticated aircraft and challenges our most sophisticated ships to gain access to the area,\u201d Col. John Rafferty, director of the Army\u2019s long-range precision fires cross-functional team, told Defense News this month. \u201cThat layered enemy standoff at the strategic level was really the fundamental problem. One of the ways to solve that problem is to deliver surface-to-surface fires that can penetrate this [anti-access, area-denial] complex, disintegrate its network and create windows of opportunity for the joint force to exploit.\u201d\n\nCol. Rafferty last year suggested the SLRC could involve a scaling-up of the existing arsenal, perhaps the use of new, rocket-boosted shells that could be fired from the M109 howitzer.\n\nStill, the Army\u2019s long-range cannon program is years from delivering a prototype. In addition to the technological challenges of firing projectiles accurately at targets 1,000 miles away \u2014 roughly the distance from Washington, D.C., to Topeka, Kansas, the Pentagon also must ensure that the cost of the advanced weapon doesn\u2019t become prohibitive.\n\nOfficials said research is underway at the Center for Army Analysis and the Research and Analysis Center at White Sands Missile Range, key hubs for Army research and development.\n\nMr. McCarthy, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and a host of other top Pentagon officials have stressed the importance of long-range precision weaponry and how it is a critical piece of the nation\u2019s 21st-century security strategy.\n\nIf the long-range cannon comes to fruition, Mr. McCarthy said, it will represent a massive step forward.\n\n\u201cWe have run all the simulations that shows the feasibility we\u2019ve procured, the material to start this,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cThat capability, in particular championed by Gen. Milley personally, is one that we think \u2026 can yield the outcome [that] would be a game-changing technology for us.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
