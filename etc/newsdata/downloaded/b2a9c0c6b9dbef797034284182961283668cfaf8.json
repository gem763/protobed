And for good measure, it landed with global equity markets in freefall.\n\nMind you, the deal is rather more complicated than just price. To secure success, the Canadians had to satisfy the idiosyncratic ambitions of Webster\u2019s two big owners. Corrigan and Fitzsimons have developed something of an attachment to a rural commercial life, even if they manage it from a distance.\n\nSo the scheme arrangements with PSP include carving off a suite of assets, big and small, into a new entity to be called KoobaCo that, all things going to plan, will end up being 50.1 per cent owned by Corrigan and Fitzsimons.\n\nThe only caveat on this second step of the deal happening is that shareholders other than Corrigan and Fitzsimons must approve the flow-through transaction under the usual scheme thresholds.\n\nTo be clear on that, Corrigan and Fitzsimons can vote their shares with meaning at the approval meeting, but the KoobaCo deal happens only if 50 per cent of shareholders apart from them vote more than 75 per cent of shares other than theirs in favour of the proposal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKoobaCo will carry a value of $276 million and its assets will include the Kooba and Hay cotton properties and the water rights that support them, part of a stock grazing business and an apiary business that is too small to warrant mention in the company\u2019s annual report.\n\nThe carrying value of the assets implies that Corrigan's and Fitzsimons' share of their new KoobaCo domain will cost them $138.2 million. Given their investments are of equal size, that will require each to recycle $69 million of the value monetised in the PSP transaction.\n\nWheeling and dealing\n\nShould shareholders approve the headstock deal, Corrigan\u2019s 12.5 per cent of Websters, accumulated through the earlier part of his time with the business, will be worth $90 million. So after all the wheeling and dealing is done, he will walk away with $21 million. Exactly how much of that he will get to keep is hard to assess though, given the likelihood that there will be some level of capital gains tax generated by the exit.\n\nCorrigan built the larger part of his stake in Webster between 2009 and 2014, a period through which the shares traded as low as 38\u00a2 and under 50\u00a2 for considerable periods.\n\nGiven that potential complication, we wondered whether the PSP deal structuring was motivated by Corrigan\u2019s quite famous dislike of capital gains tax. Our interest earned classic Corrigan short shrift.\n\n\u201cCertainly not, no,\u201d he started. \u201cFrom my point of view, it has got nothing to do with capital gains tax. It is to do with \u2026. I mean I have been in this company now for 12 years. I first got into it in 2007.\n\n\"And I have sort of been chief executive for a few years [he was appointed executive chairman in 2016 and passed the baton to current CEO Maurice Felizzi late last year]. I have been chairing it for a bit longer. I have got to know the people and the business and I just wanted to retain an interest in it and retain a relationship with the company, or at least part of it,\u201d he responded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey [PSP] wanted mainly to have the nut business [Webster supplies 90 per cent of Australia\u2019s walnuts]. I said I would like to keep an interest in the cotton and some of the water side of it. I think it is a decent investment and I have enjoyed working with the people and I would like to keep that relationship.\"\n\nOver recent years Webster has refined its strategy and portfolio. Through those years, we were often pushed to imagine that Webster was more of a water trader than a typical agriculture business. Again, Corrigan bats away that idea abruptly. If anything, Webster had evolved into a more traditional farming business, he observed.\n\n\u201cWe own enough water to do the things we are doing in agriculture,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a better balanced business. Most companies don\u2019t own the water they need. They buy it on an annual basis. But we decided we wanted to own the water and do the agriculture the way they would have done it years ago, I suppose,\u201d he said.\n\nWebster years not wasted\n\nBelieve it or not, over many years we have discussed the agriculture value curve with Corrigan. His Webster years have not been wasted. Corrigan has worked with typical diligence to understand Webster and its wider sector. He once, for example, urged me to understand that nuts delivered the greatest value from every litre of water used to grow them and then went on to discuss the art of commercial tomato growing, offering theories on the best places in Australia to grow them.\n\nWe reminded Corrigan of that conversation on Thursday.\n\n\u201cNuts really do probably give you the best return per litre of water,\u201d he reiterated. \u201cBut they demand water every year. Whereas cotton you can make the decision whether you grow it or not grow it. So you can use what they call high security water on the nuts and you use general security or low reliability water on the cotton. So in a wet year, you grow cotton and in dry years you don\u2019t grow anything,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo we built this sort of reasonably balanced business, with water, with land and orchards. The problem is, it is very capital-intensive. And frankly, I don\u2019t think that it is that suitable for a listed company. It is hard to produce the returns every year that the listed market requires. You get a fair amount of variability in your earnings.\n\n\u201cLast year we made nothing. Probably next year will make nothing. It is quite a volatile earnings experience for a listed market. And so it is probably more suitable to pension funds and private investors,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd that, of course, is going to be the shape of Webster\u2019s future, given all goes to Canada\u2019s plan.", "description": "A bad back brings the waterfront wealth-creator home just in time to welcome Canada Inc's $724m bid for Australia's biggest walnut grower", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6395%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_145%2C$y_121/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3ce9f9ebef872474f9f814c1c678f3c3b625c020", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
