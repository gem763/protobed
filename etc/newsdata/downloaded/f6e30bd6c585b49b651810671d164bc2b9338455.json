REUTERS/Satish Kumar/File Photo\n\nTV Globo, Brazil\u2019s largest TV network, reported on Tuesday that just hours before the March 2018 murder, the suspect was said to have told a doorman he was going to Bolsonaro\u2019s house, gaining access to a gated community where he met instead with another former policeman accused of murdering the left-wing politician Marielle Franco.\n\nThe case led to widespread protests by Brazilians outraged to see a black, openly gay human rights advocate gunned down. Investigators arrested two former police officers, Ronnie Lessa and Elcio de Queiroz, nearly a year later and charged them with killing Franco in return for about $50,000. Their lawyers said they did not commit the crime.\n\nRio state prosecutors said later on Wednesday that the doorman had been mistaken. At a news conference, prosecutors said it was Lessa, who lived two doors down from Bolsonaro, who had answered the intercom and allowed Queiroz to enter.\n\nBolsonaro, who took office on Jan. 1, 2019, denied any connection to the case. He said he was in Brasilia the day of the murder voting in Congress, where he was then serving as a representative. TV Globo\u2019s report also said Bolsonaro was in Brasilia the day of Franco\u2019s murder.\n\nThe president accused the media and a former ally, Rio Governor Wilson Witzel, of conspiring to attack him and his family.\n\n\u201cThis is rotten, villainous journalism by TV Globo,\u201d an enraged Bolsonaro said in a live video on social media, recorded at 4 a.m. in a Riyadh hotel during an official visit to Saudi Arabia.\n\nBolsonaro went on to discuss the timeline for renewing the license of the network, which is part of Grupo Globo, the largest media group in Brazil and includes TV, publishing, internet content and music labels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk in 2022,\u201d Bolsonaro said. \u201cYou\u2019d better hope I\u2019m dead by then, because the renewal process won\u2019t be persecution, but ... there won\u2019t be any workarounds for you or anyone else.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s office said it would not comment on Bolsonaro\u2019s remarks about renewing Globo\u2019s license.\n\nIn a statement, Globo expressed regret about Bolsonaro\u2019s comments and said its aim was to inform the Brazilian public. Referring to its license renewal, it said that it had complied with its obligations during the past 54 years.\n\nTV Globo said the doorman to Bolsonaro\u2019s gated community in Rio told police that someone in the Bolsonaro residence identified as \u201cMr. Jair\u201d confirmed the visitor on the day of Franco\u2019s murder and then waved off the doorman\u2019s concern that the car had gone to a different house.\n\n\u201cIt looks like either the doorman lied or someone induced him to commit a false testimony,\u201d Bolsonaro said.\n\nHe accused Witzel of leaking details from a confidential investigation to the press to \u201cdestroy the Bolsonaro family\u201d before the 2022 presidential elections.\n\nWitzel denied any political interference with the investigation. \u201cI deeply regret the untimely reaction of President Jair Bolsonaro,\u201d the governor said in a statement.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s justice minister, Sergio Moro, asked Brazil\u2019s top public prosecutor Augusto Aras to investigate the doorman\u2019s allegation, saying he might have given false testimony, either in error or as part of a wider conspiracy to implicate the president, according to the request made public by the ministry.\n\nAras\u2019 office, known as the PGR, said federal prosecutors in Rio de Janeiro would investigate whether there was an obstruction of justice or false testimony in the information given by the doorman.\n\nThe PGR added that information allegedly linking Bolsonaro to the murder case had been filed but remained under judicial seal.\n\nBolsonaro has denied knowing Lessa, his neighbor in the gated community in Barra de Tijuca, an affluent beachside neighborhood in southern Rio de Janeiro.\n\nPolice accused Lessa of firing the 13 shots that killed the councilwoman and her driver in execution-style murders. Queiroz was accused of driving the hitman\u2019s car.\n\nIt is not the first time Bolsonaro has been linked with the suspects. Shortly after their arrests, a photo of Queiroz circulated on social media, wearing a police T-shirt, with his arm around Bolsonaro.\n\nBrazilian news outlets reported the photo was taken from Queiroz\u2019s Facebook profile. Reuters was unable to locate the profile or verify the authenticity of the photo. At the time, Bolsonaro told reporters he had taken photos with thousands of police officers as he campaigned for the presidency.", "description": "Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday deplored a TV network's report linking him with a former police officer accused of assassinating a Rio de Janeiro city councilwoman and threatened to cancel the broadcaster's license.", "authors": ["Anthony Boadle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446579075&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1FI", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
