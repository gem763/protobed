While the first book focused (mostly) on one summer and the romance between teenage intellectual Elio and graduate student Oliver, \u201cFind Me\u201d is more fragmentary, takes a longer view and places in counterpoint a wider range of relationships.\n\nMusic, so important to Elio, provides a metaphorical structure for the book, with Aciman assigning musical directions to each of its four chapter-movements. The first, \u201cTempo,\u201d establishes a new speed and voice; while Elio narrated the whole of the first book, this one begins with his father, Samuel, before reverting to Elio, and later, Oliver.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe know from wistful asides in \u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d that Samuel somewhat regretted his own life\u2019s course: \u201csome,\u201d he had said, \u201cfor fear of taking any turns, find themselves leading the wrong life all life long.\u201d Not wishing to see his errors repeated, his message to Elio was an encouraging carpe diem, boys. The first surprise in \u201cFind Me\u201d is that it\u2019s Samuel doing the carpe-ing. On a train to Rome, he is besotted by young photographer Miranda. Though half his age, she seems to prefer older men, and in the following days the two engage in mutual seduction. She\u2019s the new beginning he hadn\u2019t known to hope for.\n\nElio, in the book\u2019s second part, also finds intergenerational love, falling in with the dapper (older) Michel, whom he meets at a chamber music recital and who soon reveals a family secret concerning a musical manuscript that bears a suggestive inscription. This chapter \u2014 like its musical precedent, the cadenza \u2014 allows Aciman to reframe and develop the themes he\u2019s already established. Is there such a thing as fate? Can meaning be ascribed to the random meetings of kindred souls? Michel certainly thinks so: \u201cFate,\u201d he says, \u201cif it exists at all, has strange ways of teasing us with patterns that may not be patterns at all but that hint at a vestigial meaning still being worked out.\u201d\n\nThe last two chapters are shorter. In \u201cCapriccio,\u201d we catch up with Oliver and discover he hasn\u2019t moved on from Elio any more than Elio has him (though both have exercised a healthy interest in others, male and female, over the years). Then in \u201cDa Capo\u201d \u2014 musically, going back to the beginning \u2014 Aciman effects his own brand of return: a reunion, yes, but with an altered cast list, in a place haunted by the past, veiled by melancholy and uncertainty. As Samuel had earlier, readers may think of the ancient Greek verb \u201copsizo\u201d: \u201cto arrive too late to the feast, or just before last call, or to feast today with the weight of all the wasted yesteryears.\u201d\n\nAciman, a famous Proustian, is clearly interested in the diffusive action of time and the heartaches of temps perdu. His keen sense of what\u2019s lost or missing, even in a happy new relationship, allows \u201cFind Me\u201d to dodge, at least in part, the sentimental imperative that mars many sequels. Its bittersweetness is welcome.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUnfortunately, the diffuseness necessarily means it lacks the intensity of \u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d whose short-leased summer gave that book its particular kind of tragic suspense. In addition, what was charmingly grandiloquent in the adolescent Elio \u2014 a florid style; an expansive frame of reference \u2014 is cloying and ostentatious in a cast of adult narrators. After a glimpse of \u201ca small abstract painting in the style of Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl\u201d or a lake reminiscent of Corot, a family that reads aloud to one another from Chateaubriand\u2019s memoirs feels like too much cozy refinement. (That said, Farrar, Straus and Giroux is launching a perfume to accompany the book, which suggests it\u2019s banking on its upmarket target readers to be charmed rather than irritated by Aciman\u2019s precious style.)\n\nA certain preciousness has some benefits. Aciman\u2019s quiet, label-free presentation of bisexual life represents a minor triumph, respectfully embracing the mystery of the desires of others. Likewise, his refusal to offer easy resolution, which infuses the whole romantic enterprise with a kind of delicious melancholy. There are moments, particularly in the final chapter, that may have readers gazing tearfully into their fireplaces, real or imaginary, just like Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet at the end of Luca Guadagnino\u2019s superlative film of \u201cCall Me by Your Name.\u201d It can be hard to go home.\n\nCharles Arrowsmith is based in New York and writes about books, films and music.\n\nFind Me\n\nBy Andr\u00e9 Aciman\n\nFarrar, Straus and Giroux. 272 pp. $27\n\nAD", "description": "The novel assumes a different structure to probe the difficulties of going back.", "authors": ["Charles Arrowsmith"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VImeH2uZ8e48r6dAY0tG3TDfkf8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M2CGPXHUIYI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
