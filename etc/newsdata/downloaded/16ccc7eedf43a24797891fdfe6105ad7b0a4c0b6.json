The love letters, written from 1944 to 1946, were so absorbing \u2013 and the two friends stood there reading them for so long \u2013 that an employee came by and joined them, becoming equally enthralled.\n\n\u201cWe were sitting there for what felt like forever,\u201d says Grant, 24, of Clarksville, Tennessee. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t read them fast enough.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWolke and Grant purchased all 21 letters, at $4 (\u00a33) a piece, and hurried to the car to continue reading the love story of Elias Maxwell and Ilaine Murray. At the time, Elias, 18, was stationed in Hawaii and Japan on the USS Rankin, and Ilaine, 19, was back in their hometown of Blackwood, New Jersey, about 15 miles from Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cThe notes were just so beautifully written,\u201d says Wolke, 24, who also lives in Clarksville. \u201cReading them just made your heart melt. It was like reading a book.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was way better than any book I\u2019ve ever read,\u201d Grant says.\n\nThe missives, each several pages long, were filled with depictions of life at war and on the home front, and the two young letter writers clearly had great affection for each other.\n\n\u201cTo my Sweetheart in the Navy,\u201d Ilaine began one letter. \u201cHi ya honey. How are you? I received two letters today from you hon and you can just imagine how good I feel.\u201d She signed off with lines of X\u2019s for kisses and wrote: \u201cAll of these and millions more.\u201d\n\nIn another letter, Elias wrote to Ilaine: \u201cThe time now is 18:50 p.m. I\u2019ve been exactly 30 minutes writing this letter so far,\u201d and asked her if she liked the pillowcase he sent her from Geneva. He ended with, \u201cWell, honey, I guess I\u2019ll close for now, this is your Navy Sweetheart saying: So long & God Bless. Yours Forever. P.S. Please think of me while I am away.\u201d\n\nThe ending to the love story, however, was missing.\n\nWolke and Grant became so invested in the lives of Ilaine and Elias that they wanted to know what happened. Did they get married and live happily together? Was Elias killed at war? Did one of them fall in love with someone else? Grant and Wolke couldn\u2019t get it out of their minds.\n\nSo they turned to an ancestry website to try to find the couple.\n\nWolke and Grant were delighted to learn that, after the war, the young lovebirds had indeed married and had four children. But they also learned Elias and Ilaine passed away years ago.\n\nWolke did some sleuthing and found two of their children on Facebook. She sent them messages but neither replied.\n\nUndeterred, she then posted a photo of the letters on Weird Secondhand Finds that Just Need to Be Shared, a Facebook group dedicated to unique and odd items found while thrifting. The group has more than a million members, and Wolke\u2019s post amassed thousands of likes and comments. It also caught the eye of a friend of one of Elias and Ilaine\u2019s children.\n\nBarbara Murray, 65, of Clementon, New Jersey, one of the Maxwell children, had seen Wolke\u2019s message about the letters but dismissed it as spam. It wasn\u2019t until a friend sent Wolke\u2019s post from the Facebook group that Murray allowed herself to consider it could be real.\n\nThe sight of her mother\u2019s handwriting on the envelopes left her \u201cliterally shaking,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter messaging back-and-forth, Wolke reached Murray on the phone \u2013 a call that lasted nearly two hours.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They worked at a stocking mill together. Then, Elias went on to work as a machinist for Pennwalt and Ilaine went to work in a sweater mill.\n\nElias died in 1993, and Ilaine moved to a nursing home in 2010, which is when their house in Clementon, New Jersey \u2013 not far from their hometown of Blackwood \u2013 went into liquidation, and the bank sold much of her parents\u2019 possessions, Murray says.\n\nMurray had one letter saved from her parents\u2019 wartime correspondence, but neither she nor her siblings knew there were more of their parents\u2019 historic love dispatches. That\u2019s why they were in such shock that the letters turned up for sale years later, several states away.\n\nMurray says she was extremely moved that the two young women found them and were so determined to track her down.\n\n\u201cThere really are nice people still left in the world,\u201d Murray says.\n\nAfter the phone conversation, Wolke and Grant knew they needed to reunite the letters with the Maxwell family but couldn\u2019t imagine anyone else making the delivery from Tennessee to New Jersey.\n\n\u201cWe had such an attachment to these letters. We just loved them so much,\u201d Wolke says. \u201cI didn\u2019t trust the mail service to take them up there and keep them safe.\u201d\n\nOn 4 October, a month after their incredible discovery, Wolke and Grant jumped in Grant\u2019s car and drove 800 miles, overnighting in Washington, to return all 21 letters to their rightful owners.\n\nThe four Maxwell siblings and their new friends from Tennessee met at a restaurant in New Jersey on 6 October. There was laughter and a few tears, before the siblings took Wolke and Grant on a tour of Elias and Ilaine\u2019s hometown. Wolke and Grant wanted to see all the places mentioned in the letters and to hear more about the couple they\u2019d grown so fond of.\n\nThey visited the land that once belonged to Ilaine\u2019s family and the location of Elias\u2019s childhood home. They found out that Ilaine and Elias met as kids and saw where the two would walk together to school.\n\nThey heard stories about how Ilaine was shy and reserved, while Elias was outgoing. They were invited to take a look around the Maxwell family home. Several years after the bank took possession of it, Murray\u2019s daughter purchased it back. It\u2019s where the Maxwell children grew up \u2013 the same home where Elias would put a board out on the back patio for tap dancing. (\u201cHe tap danced at all our weddings. He was a bit of a character,\u201d Murray says.)\n\n\u201cStanding on that land and knowing Elias and Ilaine walked there, together, we felt a connection, like we were there with them,\u201d Wolke says. \u201cAnd being in the house they built and raised a family in, it was just incredible.\u201d\n\nGrant added: \u201cWe felt like we knew Ilaine and Elias, even before they had kids or got married. We just felt like we were meant to be there [in Blackwood].\u201d\n\nLeaving the letters in New Jersey was bittersweet for Wolke and Grant, but ultimately, the perfect ending to this story.\n\n\u201cI was just so happy these letters were wanted,\u201d Wolke says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t discarded. They were just lost from this family. They didn\u2019t even know the letters existed.\u201d\n\nMurray says she was grateful to experience her parents\u2019 young love in their own words \u2013 \u201cto have a piece of my parents \u2013 just to see what their life was like when they were young and in love\u201d.\n\nMurray took a moment to imagine how her parents would have reacted to this story of two strangers unearthing their heartfelt and personal letters.\n\n\u201cI think my mother would probably blush some,\u201d Murray says. \u201cMy dad would be like, \u2018Wow! This is great!\u2019 He might even do a little tap dance.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Washington Post\n\nThe Independent's Millennial Love group is the best place to discuss to the highs and lows of modern dating and relationships.
