He's also a millionaire and founder of BloomVentures, a company he started when he was just 15.\n\nAnd the money-making whizz kid is convinced that, while it might not be easy, anyone can follow in his footsteps.\n\nSo, to help budding entrepreneurs across the world, the Brisbane resident has put together his six key lessons for doing it yourself.\n\n\"It is my honest belief that if a 15-year-old with just $500 [\u00a3276] and the internet can start a business, anyone with a will can too whether you are 12 or 56,\" he wrote on LinkedIn .\n\n\"It's easy to make excuses for not launching your side-hustle, isn't it? I\u2019m too young, too old, too busy,\" Jack said.\n\n\"Well I'm here to tell you that every one of those excuses is nonsense. Anyone of any age can launch a successful side-hustle, and every single one of those businesses has the opportunity to grow into a multi-million-dollar company.\"\n\nThese are his top tips.\n\n(Image: @jackbloomfield /Instagram)\n\n1. Passion trumps profit\n\nIf you\u2019re launching a side-hustle just to make money, you\u2019re doomed to fail before you even begin.\n\nBecause the truth is that it won't always be easy. There will be challenges and obstacles you face along the way, and you\u2019ll usually be facing them after a long day at school or work, or late at night once the kids have gone to bed, and if you don\u2019t have passion driving you, it will all seem too hard.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to start a side-hustle but you\u2019re not passionate about what you\u2019re doing, then it feels like a second job, not a passion project. And as soon as you hit a roadblock or an obstacle, you\u2019ll be out of there.\n\n2. Know what you're in for\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nYes, the rewards can be great, but you need to be honest with yourself about exactly what lies ahead of you. Are you really willing to give it everything you\u2019ve got? To work outside work hours and weekends to make your dreams a reality?\n\nA side-hustle success story requires grit, determination and a hell of a lot of hard work. The goal should be to replace your full-time job with your new business, because if a side-hustle can grow to a point where it can replace your work income, and you followed step one, then you get to pursue that passion for the rest of your life.\n\nBut not everyone gets a kick out of working weekends and late nights, so you need to know what drives you, what keeps you motivated, because when times get tough - and they will - that\u2019s what will keep you moving forward.\n\n3. Begin at the end\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe first side-hustle you launch, or your first great idea, probably wont work. And your second one might not, either. But that\u2019s fine. Failure is a precursor to success.\n\nI started four or five businesses before I launched my e-commerce site that has been such a huge success. And through it all, I never lost sight of the end goal, and I never panicked.\n\nIt\u2019s why it is so important to have the finish line in mind, right from the beginning.\n\nI have a five-step action plan I use right from the start; five things I need to do to get me to that end point.\n\nNow sometime they\u2019ll change, because things do come up, and you\u2019ll have to adapt and make changes as you go, but never lose sight of the end goal.\n\n4. Take it seriously\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nWhen you start your side-hustle, you\u2019re running a business. You\u2019re a CEO, no matter how big or small your business is. And you\u2019re in charge.\n\nI launched one of my first businesses when I was 12 years old. The idea that a kid at 12 can be a CEO? A business owner? How cool is that? That\u2019s what the internet unlocks for everyone. Anyone can be a CEO, be their own boss, and be in charge of their own destiny.\n\nRemember, most people don't care if you succeed or fail (and it they\u2019re being honest, most would prefer to see you fall), so it\u2019s up to you and you alone to make sure you don\u2019t.\n\n5. No idea is bulletproof\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nFor most entrepreneurs, their first idea is never their best idea. And not all ideas are successful.\n\nSo forget what your family and friends think; they\u2019ll always tell you it\u2019s great - they don\u2019t want to hurt your feelings. The only person who is going to be 100 per cent honest is your customer, so take your idea to market and see if it works.\n\nI like to work on a 14-day schedule; so from an idea to market in two weeks, because it's the only way to know if the idea is good or not.\n\nAnd it\u2019s all well and good having the best idea in the world, but if you don\u2019t take action, then that idea is worthless. The foundation of any business is action: you can have the best business plan ever, but it's not worth the paper its printed on if you do nothing about it.\n\n6. Be unrealistic\n\n(Image: Dave Hodge)\n\nGoals and business targets are a fantastic way of growing your business, but too often people aim too low, celebrating mediocre results when they could have had so much more.\n\nInstead of saying you want to grow your revenue by two per cent, why not aim for 20 per cent? Sure, it sounds unobtainable, but even if you finish the year on 10 per cent growth, that\u2019s better than being satisfied with two per cent, right?\n\nThis is about setting goals that are bigger than your expectations. When your business starts firing, your very next step is to set massive goals and start working hard towards them. Because even if you miss them, landing close will be a huge win for your business.", "description": "Millionaire teen entrepreneur and founder of BloomVentures, Jack Bloomfield has shared his six secrets for turning a side project into something a bit special", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Jackbloomfield", "Instagram", "Getty", "Dave Hodge"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20560366.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Self-made-millionaire-17-shares-top-tips-for-staring-a-successful-side-hustle.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
