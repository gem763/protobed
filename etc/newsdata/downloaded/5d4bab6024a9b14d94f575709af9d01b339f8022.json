Correa and his fiance, former Miss Texas USA, Daniella Rodriguez, met 16-year-old Jalen Garcia Friday at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, CBS Houston reports.\n\nThe teen went viral last week after his high school football team traveled some 350 miles from Laredo, Texas to see him.\n\nGarcia was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma when he was in the 8th grade, forcing him to stop playing football, his mom told CBS News. However, the football team still treated him like a player.\n\nFootball team travels across Texas to visit teen battling cancer in hopsital MIRACLE MAN: This teen was diagnosed with cancer, but is still included in the football team.

After hearing about Garcia, she was compelled to visit him in Houston, too. She and Correa saw Garcia just hours before the MLB star battled the Yankees at Minute Maid Park.\n\n\"Nothing else in this world is as rewarding as this,\" Rodriguez wrote on Instagram, sharing several photos of herself and Correa with Garcia.\n\n\"As soon as I heard about Jalen being in Houston I made sure we did everything possible to meet him. You are our hero Jalen!
