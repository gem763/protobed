The latter is the longest postseason skid for one club against another in baseball history, topping Boston's dominance over the Angels from 1986-2008. Minnesota hasn't won a playoff game since Johan Santana bested the Yankees in their 2004 Division Series opener.\n\nCoaches and players on both sides have downplayed that history, most of which predates current rosters.
