Districts to host 30,000 people and the villages to host 5,000 people each. Initially, 10 districts and 140 villages will be settled. This is a draft plan, studies still under way.\n\nDevelopment project\n\nUnder a plan presented late last month by the Turkish presidency, 140 villages and 10 districts would be set up in the safe zone with a goal of accommodating at least one million Syrians.\n\nThe project includes the establishment of universities, schools, youth centres, hospitals, sports halls and 200,000 housing units.\n\nThe settlements would require 92.6 million square metres (996 million square feet) of land. Another 140 million square metres (1.5 billion square feet) would be needed for agricultural production.\n\nThe presidency says the project is expected to cost $26.4bn, seen as far beyond Turkey's financial means.\n\n\"With the help of international society, we're hoping to set the necessary terms for the return of Syrians,\" Fahrettin Altun, the Turkish presidency's communications director, told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe said the project might take a year to complete, depending on international cooperation, and predicted an immediate start of voluntary refugee returns if everything went as planned.\n\n'Humanitarian catastrophe risk'\n\nWhile the government says it is taking the lead in building an international coalition to fund the project, some have cast doubts about the plan's feasibility.\n\nIn an article in the opposition paper Sozcu, economist Ege Cansen called for clarity over the financial policies of the safe zone. He also raised questions about the makeup of the planned local administration, pointing to possible disagreements by current residents in relation to public works and the building of settlements.\n\nOn Monday, meanwhile, the United Nations warned against the further displacement of civilians in the event of a Turkish military operation in northeast Syria and expressed concern over the safe zone plan.\n\nEdiz Ekinci, a former Afghanistan adviser to the UN, said humanitarian issues were a priority for the Turkish armed forces.\n\n\"If there is the risk of a humanitarian catastrophe, that operational plan is either cancelled or updated by the military. Our forces have always won general approval by our NATO allies.\"\n\nWhile Turkey believes the military operation for a safe zone is essential for stability, voices within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that controls the northeastern region from east of the Euphrates River to the Iraq border have argued that by sending millions of Syrians back to this area Turkey seeks to change local demographics.\n\nAltun refuted these claims, saying those who fled those areas to Turkey were now afraid to return and accused the YPG of ethnic cleansing in the area.\n\n\"You can't mention it as a 'demographic change' when locals want to return after you seized the administration of a place by force and displaced local people,\" he said.\n\nAnkara views the YPG armed group as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is deemed a \"terrorist organisation\" by Ankara, the United States and the European Union.\n\nIn a 2014 report, Human Rights Watch documented a range of human rights abuses in areas controlled by the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), the political wing of the YPG, including arbitrary arrests, disappearances and killings, jurisdictional violations, arrests of political opponents, abuse of prisoners and the use of child soldiers.\n\nIn an October 2015 report, Amnesty International also documented civilians living in parts of northern Syria were subjected to serious abuses by the PYD, including forced displacement and home demolitions.\n\nIt said the instances of forced displacement and demolition and confiscation of civilian property constitute \"war crimes\".\n\nIn another report last year, Amnesty said residents in Afrin were enduring a wide range of violations, mostly at the hands of Syrian armed groups that have been equipped and armed by Turkey. The rights group accused Ankara of turning a blind eye to it.", "description": "Development projects planned for safe return of Syrian refugees, but critics raise questions about feasibility.", "authors": ["Sinem Koseoglu"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/669dfbeb4dc74654921f1f98a2dc903b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
