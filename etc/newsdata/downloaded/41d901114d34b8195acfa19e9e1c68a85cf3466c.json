Erdogan is the latest to take advantage of that.", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump is bragging that his decision last week to withdraw US troops from northern Syria \u2014 leaving America\u2019s allies, the Syrian Kurds, to fend for themselves against invading Turkish forces \u2014 was a \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d masterstroke. He also says the Syria ceasefire his administration agreed to with Turkey on Thursday amounted to \u201ca great day for civilization.\u201d\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t seem to know that he\u2019s played right into Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s hands \u2014 the latest horrifying example of how Trump gets taken advantage of by wily strongmen.\n\nThe ceasefire in Syria is already falling apart. Shelling and gunfire are ringing out in Ras al-Ayn, a town in Syria\u2019s north, as Turkish forces also target medical and aid organizations to stop the evacuation of injured civilians. Erdo\u011fan, however, falsely told reporters Friday that clashes between Turkish-backed troops and Syrian Kurds weren\u2019t happening. He seemingly relayed that same message to Trump during a recent phone call \u2014 and the president bought it.\n\n.....this thinking years ago. Instead, it was always held together with very weak bandaids, & in an artificial manner. There is good will on both sides & a really good chance for success. The U.S. has secured the Oil, & the ISIS Fighters are double secured by Kurds & Turkey.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s just embarrassing. Despite clear evidence that violence continues in northern Syria, all it took was Erdo\u011fan saying, \u201cNope, nothing to see here!\u201d to convince Trump the ceasefire was actually holding. Trump even backed Erdo\u011fan by saying that the Turkish president \u201cvery much wants the ceasefire, or pause, to work.\u201d\n\nTrump, announcing the ceasefire on Twitter Thursday, had thanked Erdo\u011fan for agreeing to it, saying, \u201cMillions of lives will be saved!\u201d Erdo\u011fan responded, tweeting: \u201cMr. President, many more lives will be saved when we defeat terrorism, which is humanity\u2019s arch enemy.\u201d\n\nThat may sound innocuous, but it\u2019s anything but. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s entire rationale for killing Kurds in Syria is that they are \u201cterrorists\u201d because they are closely aligned with the PKK, a Kurdish armed group that for decades has waged a violent insurgency inside Turkey to establish an independent Kurdish state.\n\nSo the message Erdo\u011fan was sending with his response was essentially: \u201cSure, this ceasefire of yours may save the lives of the Syrian Kurds, but it would save more lives if you\u2019d just let me kill them all because they\u2019re terrorists.\u201d It was a very grim, and defiant, message Erdo\u011fan was giving Trump.\n\nUnfortunately, that subtle message was apparently completely lost on Trump \u2014 because minutes after posting that earlier Twitter thread on Friday, he quoted Erdo\u011fan\u2019s message and added one of his own: \u201cDEFEAT TERRORISM!\u201d\n\nTrump completely missed that Erdogan was basically trolling him and instead boosted the Turkish president\u2019s anti-Syrian Kurd propaganda.\n\nIt would be funny if it weren\u2019t all so tragic. Despite having some of the world\u2019s greatest intelligence agencies at his disposal, Trump instead prefers to believe whatever a strongman tells him.\n\nEven more embarrassing, it\u2019s clear Erdo\u011fan doesn\u2019t reciprocate the admiration. Speaking to reporters Friday about the stunning letter Trump had sent him \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy! Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d part of it read \u2014 Erdo\u011fan said the letter \u201cwas not in line with diplomatic and political courtesy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not forget this lack of respect. This is not a priority for us,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said at a press conference in Istanbul. \u201cBut when the time comes we would like it to be known that we will take the necessary steps.\u201d\n\nAccording to the BBC, the Turkish leader threw the letter in the trash.\n\nIt\u2019d be one thing if world leaders just put up with Trump. It\u2019s another entirely that Trump allows them to take advantage of his unpreparedness and predilection for flattery to serve their needs instead of America\u2019s.\n\nTrump cows to strongmen time and time again\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering where foreign policy has gone wrong under Trump, look no further than his fawning over autocrats.\n\n\u201cThis all seems to result from Trump\u2019s somewhat bizarre but persistent belief that you can only trust the word of other strongmen \u2014 from China\u2019s Xi Jinping to North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un to Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin,\u201d Paul Musgrave, a US foreign policy expert at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, told me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can easily think of other times when this sort of personal trust in authoritarian leaders has so dictated US presidents\u2019 approaches,\u201d Musgrave added.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick trip down memory lane:\n\nTrump has repeatedly bought Putin\u2019s denials that Russia interfered in the 2016 election despite his own intelligence agencies and former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation clearly showing that it did.\n\nTrump has met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times due to the belief that the dictator will dismantle his nuclear weapons \u2014 despite the fact that nearly every North Korea expert and even former Trump officials say Kim has no intention of doing so anytime soon , and in fact has only increased his nuclear arsenal since diplomacy began last year.\n\n, and in fact has only increased his nuclear arsenal since diplomacy began last year. Trump for a long time backed off on criticizing China\u2019s treatment of Hong Kong because Xi made the president believe that Beijing wants to sign a trade deal imminently.\n\nTrump refuses to blame Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of US resident and Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, even though the CIA concluded the prince was behind the hit.\n\nThat\u2019s not all, but you get the idea. And why is Trump so easily entranced by these men? Partly because they have done a lot to flatter him.\n\nWhen Saudi Arabia hosted Trump in May 2017, for example, they projected a five-story image of his face onto the Ritz-Carlton hotel where he stayed.\n\nSaudi Royal's, in true royal style, project Trump's face on the Ritz Carlton he was staying inhttps://t.co/sMlbXzSsJy pic.twitter.com/wJcYs0YUw2 \u2014 DoubleTap (@DoubleTapDaily) May 23, 2017\n\nWhen Trump visited China for the first time as president later that year, Beijing delivered its own special reception for him, calling it a \u201cstate visit-plus.\u201d Among many lavish things, Trump and Xi dined in the Forbidden City, Beijing\u2019s ancient imperial palace for Chinese emperors. It\u2019s an honor that a US president hadn\u2019t been granted since the founding of modern China.\n\nKim has continually given Trump what he wants: recognition for doing something historic. Trump is now the first sitting president to meet with a North Korean leader, and even became the first to step inside the country this year.\n\nAnd while Turkey hasn\u2019t gone out of its way to praise Trump, Erdo\u011fan had to know the American president was an easy mark. They\u2019ve looked cozy together whenever they\u2019ve met, and he knew Trump spent years railing against US troop deployments to the Middle East. All he had to do, then, was play nice, flatter Trump, and he knew he\u2019d probably get what he wanted.\n\nThe troubles facing Syria \u2014 and troubles elsewhere \u2014 are therefore in large part caused not by America\u2019s inherent weakness, but by Trump\u2019s.", "description": "The troubles facing Syria are because Trump loves dictators like Turkey\u2019s Erdogan.", "authors": ["Alex Ward", "Emily Todd Vanderwerff", "Riley Beggin", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IvHd_daQvxVvDIaiNjFUSJH8SrM=/0x0:4500x2356/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19300029/996213214.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
