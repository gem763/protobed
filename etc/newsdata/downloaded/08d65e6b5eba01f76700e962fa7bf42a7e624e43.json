The Kurdish administration in north-eastern Syria puts the figure much higher, at more than 191,000.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from the area effectively triggered the Turkish incursion against the SDF - the main Western allies in the fight against IS.\n\nWhat did the Kurds say?\n\nFighting on the Syrian border with Turkey has prevented the SDF from securing IS detention camps in areas under its control, senior official Redur Xelil said in a televised statement on Saturday.\n\n\"Guarding IS prisons is no longer a priority. Whoever cares about the secure detention of the prisoners they are welcome to come and find a solution.\"\n\nInstead, he said, SDF forces would \"move to protect our cities and our people\".\n\nHe warned that the Turkish operation was opening the way for IS to regroup.\n\n\"It has revived it and activated its cells in Qamishli and Hassakeh,\" he said.\n\nWhat is IS doing in Syria?\n\nThe comments come after two deadly car bombs in both cities a day earlier, claimed by IS.\n\nFive IS members also escaped from a prison in Qamishli amid Turkish shelling on Friday, the SDF said.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption IS said it was behind a deadly car bomb attack in the Kurdish-majority city of Qamishli on Friday\n\nSeparately on Saturday, IS declared a new campaign in Syria, which it said was to avenge its members' detention in Kurdish-run prisons.\n\nThe SDF says it is currently holding more than 12,000 suspected IS members in seven prisons, and at least 4,000 of them are foreign nationals.
