Two protesters have also been shot and wounded during skirmishes with police.\n\nMany protesters have accused the police of using excessive force but police say they have shown restraint despite increased violence.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nA Hong Kong court granted an injunction earlier this week to ban anyone from blocking or damaging areas used to house married police officers and other disciplined services that have been targeted in the anti-government protests.\n\n\"Hong Kong City\" will be located in Zhaoqing, 200 kilometres or 1.5 hours by high-speed rail from Hong Kong, according to the letter. The first phase is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.\n\n\"(The city) aims to provide a high quality life with low cost,\" the association said, adding it would try to get a good price from Agile for its members.\n\nThe Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' Association was also involved in the collaboration, it said.\n\nAgile said it had entered into a letter of intent with the Zhaoqing municipal government to build a community featuring Hong Kong culture in a diversified project that is suitable for post-retirement living.
