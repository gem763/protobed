She had refused to help his efforts to persuade Ukrainian officials to hand over compromising information about Trump\u2019s potential rival for the presidency in 2020, Joe Biden.\n\nMcKinley is reported to have told the House committees he was appalled at Trump\u2019s dismissive references to Yovanovitch in a 25 July phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump called \u201cthe woman\u201d who was \u201cbad news\u201d and who would be \u201cgoing through some things\u201d.\n\nMcKinley\u2019s appeals were \u201cgreeted with silence\u201d CNN reported, prompting McKinley to resign last week. As a top adviser, McKinley was a fixture at Pompeo\u2019s side but the relationship between the two has soured dramatically. Pompeo did not even issue a statement thanking McKinley for his 37 years of service, as would have been customary for any departing veteran diplomat.\n\nYovanovitch testified last week that Trump had forced her out of her job, and there was a concerted campaign to smear her. She speculated that Giuliani had attacked her because he was representing \u201cprivate interests\u201d in Ukraine.\n\nTwo Soviet-born US businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who worked with Giuliani in his trawl for anti-Biden material, were arrested last week on charges of fraudulently funneling foreign money into the Trump campaign.\n\nPompeo had boasted he would bring \u201cswagger\u201d back to the state department which had become demoralised under his predecessor, Rex Tillerson. But congressional testimony in recent days has painted a picture of disillusion and disarray.\n\nOn Tuesday, George Kent, deputy assistant secretary in the bureau of European and Eurasian affairs, told the House committees he was sidelined on Ukraine policy and told to \u201clay low\u201d. Yovanovitch said that the state department had been \u201cattacked and hollowed out from within\u201d.\n\nWriting in the Foreign Affairs journal, William Burns, a former deputy secretary of state wrote that in three and a half decades of service: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen an attack on diplomacy as damaging, to both the state department as an institution and our international influence, as the one now underway.\u201d", "description": "Michael McKinley testified to Congress appeals to the secretary of state to stand up for Marie Yovanovitch were \u2018greeted with silence\u2019", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4fbaa36c99675523fbd6f8eb5d988673d1e33ae/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1fa78b3af3e30da6309bfed20d955410", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
