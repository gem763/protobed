(Remember, Kelly Kapoor is likely in jail!) In a new interview with Elle, though, Kaling relayed a story from her early years of working on the show, where the Television Academy tried to strip her of a producer\u2019s credit when The Office was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series. The Academy\u2019s reasoning, Kaling said, was that there were \u201ctoo many\u201d producers to be considered, but only cut her, the sole woman of color at the time, from the list. \u201cThey made me, not any of the other producers, fill out a whole form and write an essay about all my contributions as a writer and a producer,\u201d Kaling explained. \u201cI had to get letters from all the other male, white producers saying that I had contributed, when my actual record stood for itself.\u201d Her name was ultimately included on the list, but the show lost to 30 Rock that year.\n\nIn a Twitter thread written after the interview was published, Kaling said that she was reluctant to finally discuss the incident in public, because \u201cThe Office was one of the greatest creative experiences of my life.\u201d She also disputed the Television Academy\u2019s statement to the Los Angeles Times, which said \u201cno one person was singled out\u201d from consideration at the time. \u201cRespectfully, the Academy\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Kaling added. \u201cI was singled out. There were other Office writer-performer-producers who were not cut from the list. Just me. The most junior person, and woman of color. Easiest to dismiss. Just sayin\u2019.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve never wanted to bring up that incident because The Office was one of the greatest creative experiences of my life, and who would want to have an adversarial relationship with the Academy, who has the ongoing power to enhance our careers with awards?

I had written so many episodes, put in so much time in the editing room, just to have the Academy discard it because they couldn\u2019t fathom I was capable of doing it all. Thankfully I was rescued by my friends, the other producers. \u2014 Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) October 9, 2019\n\n(3) The point is, we shouldn\u2019t have be bailed out because of the kindness our more powerful white male colleagues. Not mentioning it seemed like glossing over my story. This was like ten years ago. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t happen now. But it happened to me. \u2014 Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) October 9, 2019\n\nRespectfully, the Academy\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t make any sense. I *was* singled out. There were other Office writer-performer-producers who were NOT cut from the list. Just me. The most junior person, and woman of color. Easiest to dismiss. Just sayin\u2019. https://t.co/frT2pQUfLF \u2014 Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) October 9, 2019\n\nKaling would go on to write (or co-write) 18 episodes for The Office, which included fan favorites such as \u201cBen Frankin,\u201d \u201cHot Girl,\u201d and \u201cThe Dundies.\u201d", "description": "Mindy Kaling says the TV Academy, which overseas the Emmys, tried to strip her of a producers credit while she was a writer of the Office.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/09/09-mindy-kaling-the-office.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
