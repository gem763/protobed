Experts say that what comes next could be restructuring, layoffs, and maybe even a big sale to a competitor.", "language": "en", "text": "Tuesday might go down as a turning point for the cloud-storage company Box.\n\nAccording to a regulatory filing, the activist hedge fund Starboard Value purchased 11 million shares of the company, giving it a 7.5% stake. That makes Starboard the third-largest stakeholder in Box, behind Vanguard Group and BlackRock.\n\nStarboard's involvement is poised to put Box's cofounder and CEO, Aaron Levie, in a predicament, several reports note, because the hedge fund has a track record of waging intense proxy battles for company ownership, ousting existing management, and spearheading major acquisitions.\n\nPerhaps most notably, Starboard is credited with helping make it possible for Verizon to acquire Yahoo in 2016, after it successfully negotiated control of four board seats.\n\nRead more: Peloton's CEO once bragged on TV that the company was 'weirdly profitable,' but the startup's IPO filing reveals years of losses\n\nIn the filing disclosing its stake, Starboard said only that Box was \"undervalued and represented an attractive investment opportunity.\"\n\nLevie seconded that sentiment Thursday. \"In the case of Starboard and many of our investors, there's a belief we're undervalued right now and there's an opportunity to grow that value,\" he said onstage at the TechCrunch Sessions Enterprise event in San Francisco.\n\nTo that end, Business Insider spoke with several analysts, and the consensus appears to be that Starboard's most likely play is to pressure management into improving the company's profit margins. That could force Box to cut costs \u2014 which could mean layoffs. Besides that, the analysts said, Box could well end up getting gobbled up by a larger tech company.\n\n\"Starboard, as a more value-oriented activist, saw a very good product here and a company that was, let's say, still trying to figure it out and maybe hasn't fully adapted to the fact that the growth rate of the business is a lot lower than they expected it to be a couple of years ago,\" Jason Ader, a cohead of technology equity research for the analyst firm William Blair, told Business Insider.\n\nAmid all of this, Box has had a difficult year on the public markets, even as it continues to compete with cloud behemoths like Google and Microsoft in enterprise cloud storage. At the time of writing, it was trading at about $17 a share. That's up from the $15 or so it was trading at before Starboard announced its stake but well below its 52-week high of about $25.\n\n\"The company is in this purgatory between growth investors and value investors right now, which presents interesting opportunities for activism,\" Ader said. \"An activist could really accelerate growth and attract growth investors, or try to accelerate profitability to attract value investors, but I would think it's more the latter with Starboard.\"\n\n\"While we do not comment on interactions with our investors, Box is committed to maintaining an active and engaged dialogue with stockholders,\" a Box spokeswoman told Business Insider. \"The Board of Directors and management team are focused on delivering growth and profitability to drive long-term stockholder value as we continue to pioneer the Cloud Content Management market.\"\n\nThat, too, echoes Levie's comments on Tuesday.\n\n\"We're extremely focused on accelerating our growth rate,\" Levie said. \"With Starboard or any other investor, that's what we tend to be focused on.\"\n\nHere's what we know about Starboard and what its investment may mean for Box's future.\n\nRosalie Chan contributed reporting to this story.", "description": "Starboard Value revealed it purchased 7.5% of the cloud storage company in a filing Tuesday.
