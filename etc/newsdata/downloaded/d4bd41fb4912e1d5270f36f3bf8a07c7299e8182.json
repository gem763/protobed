In 2020, it will introduce swappable battery kiosks in cities, which will allowriders, drivers and couriers to exchange batteries on Jump-branded vehicles.\n\nLike all bike and scooter companies, Uber faces significant costs to charge and maintain its fleet. The company has increased rental prices this year. It's expensive to hire workers to travel around cities replacing dead batteries, so having riders swap batteries could reduce how many people Uber needs to pay.\n\n\"We're focused on ensuring this becomes an economically viable business over the long term,\" Rachel Holt, who leads new mobility at Uber, told CNN Business ahead of the event. \"We've seen tremendous improvements over the course of this year in that regard and a ton of efforts underway that will continue to improve that over next year.\"\n\nUber made the announcements at an event in San Francisco, which included updates on its ridesharing, food delivery, freight hauling businesses and some incremental safety features.", "description": "Uber announced a number of changes to its bike and scooter business Thursday as the company faces pressure to become profitable.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190926134658-01-uber-bikes-jump-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
