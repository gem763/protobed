Safe Zone created! Ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended. Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us. Captured ISIS prisoners secured. I will be making a statement at 11:00 A.M. from the White House. Thank you!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nBig success on the Turkey/Syria Border. Safe Zone created!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2019\n\nPablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\nThe president's tweet comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced they had reached a separate deal on how to divide up and control northeastern Syria -- from which U.S. forces recently withdrew.\n\nAzad Lashkari/Reuters\n\nThe deal came just before the U.S.-Turkish halt in hostilities reached its deadline, with a senior Trump administration official touting it as \"one of the best ceasefires I've ever seen.\"\n\nBut as the remaining 1,000 U.S. troops withdraw from northeast Syria at President Donald Trump's command, critics have blasted Trump and his administration for ceding this territory to Turkey, Russia and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has overseen a brutal war against his own people, and giving up leverage to accomplish U.S. goals in the region, including ensuring the defeat of the Islamic State and expelling Iranian forces from Syria that threaten U.S. allies, especially Israel.\n\nAfter the announcement, the U.S. special envoy for Syria told the Senate Tuesday that Putin took \"a page from what we have done\" and came up with a \"similar ceasefire in many regards for the rest of northeast Syria, except the Turks got even less\" -- meaning Russia got more out of its negotiations with Turkey than the U.S. team.\n\nThe deal between Erdogan and Putin calls for Syrian Kurdish forces and their weapons to be removed from a buffer zone the length of the border in northeastern Syria -- an expansive area where these forces live now that extends 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) in from the border. Turkey would maintain control of the portion it now has, thanks to its agreement with the U.S., while Assad's forces, backed by Russia, would secure the rest of it.\n\nThis is a developing story.
