During his speech, the president enthusiastically smeared Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), as he has done before. He exaggerated and misinterpreted comments made by Omar to portray her as broadly anti-Semitic and anti-American.\n\nOmar is a naturalized citizen who was born in Somalia and came to the United States as a refugee during Somalia\u2019s civil war. She\u2019s one of thousands of natives of Somalia who live in and around Minneapolis; support from Somali Americans is a key reason she won election to Congress in the very district where Trump was holding his rally.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKnowing his supporters \u2014 if not the sentiment in the surrounding community \u2014 Trump on Thursday extended his disparagement of Omar as an individual to a criticism of Somali refugees and immigrants at large as unwanted.\n\n\u201cAs you know, for many years, leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia,\u201d he said to boos from the audience, \u201cwithout considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers. I promised you that as president, I would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls\u201d \u2014 applause \u2014 \u201cand I\u2019ve done that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince coming into office, I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85 percent,\u201d he added to cheers.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s true that Trump has dramatically curtailed the number of refugees coming to the United States since his inauguration. From fiscal years 2013 to 2016, the country admitted an average of 74,000 refugees a year. In fiscal year 2017, which began while Barack Obama was still president, the annual cap was lifted to 110,000, a recognition of the ongoing conflicts in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.\n\nWhen Trump took over in the middle of that fiscal year, refugee resettlements dropped significantly. (From October to December 2016, 10,000 refugees were admitted \u2014 about the same number admitted from January to September 2017.) For fiscal years 2018 and 2019, the Trump administration dramatically cut the maximum number of refugees allowed to come to the country.\n\nThe number of Somalis in particular dropped, due in part to the country being a focus of Trump\u2019s entry ban. In fiscal year 2016, 9,000 Somali refugees came to the United States. In the first three months of fiscal year 2017 \u2014 until Trump was inaugurated \u2014 another 3,500 did. Since then, about 3,000 have been admitted, including fewer than 500 in the past two fiscal years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis policy was public, if quiet. There were moments when Trump\u2019s hostility to refugees would break to the surface, as when he referred to Haiti, El Salvador and African nations as \u201cshithole countries\u201d from which migrants were unwelcome. But generally, Trump\u2019s anti-refugee sentiment was just a quiet policy change within his administration.\n\nThat was before the 2020 presidential election began to gear up. In his speech on Thursday, Trump offered a stark, hyperbolic warning to the audience.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats were ever to seize power, they would open the floodgates to unvetted, uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s bad now? You would never have seen anything like what they want to do, but in the Trump administration we will always protect American families first, and that has not been done in Minnesota.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAgain, the question is how much of the enthusiasm that met his comments came from Minnesotans or residents of Omar\u2019s district. It\u2019s unquestionable, though, that there is a strain of resentment in the area, targeting refugees and migrants.\n\nIn June, the New York Times\u2019s Astead Herndon went to Minnesota to evaluate the extent of resentment among residents. He spoke with a number of Republicans in the area, including a member of the city council in St. Cloud.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re becoming American citizens,\u201d Paul Brandmire said. \u201cAnd they have every right to, but this is killing us. This is the Hatfields and McCoys.\u201d\n\nA radio host named Bob Carrillo was less discreet, putting a picture of his grandchildren on the table while speaking with Herndon to emphasize the purported threat.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re 2 percent of the population right now, and in 5 to 10 years they\u2019ll be at 5 percent. At that point, we\u2019re done for,\u201d he told Herndon.\n\nAD\n\nIn Minnesota broadly, though, such sentiments are the minority. A poll conducted last October found that most Minnesotans disagree with Trump\u2019s immigration policies, including two-thirds of those near Minneapolis. Half of those in the state\u2019s capital said that the number of refugees allowed to come to Minnesota should return to pre-Trump levels \u2014 or be increased. Statewide, a quarter of respondents wanted to halt refugee immigration.\n\nThis is the ongoing tension of Trump\u2019s politics. His rhetoric resonates with and energizes a number of often-vocal Americans even while a majority opposes what he\u2019s doing. In 2016, the passion of the pro-Trump minority was enough for him to carry states such as Wisconsin and Michigan. His presidency and his 2020 campaign are predicated on the idea that invigorating that minority again will assure his reelection.\n\nSo, in Minnesota, the undercurrent of hostility to migrants again resurfaces. Maybe the people who were cheering him on weren\u2019t from Minneapolis or even Minnesota, but they\u2019re definitely going to vote Trump in 2020.\n\nAD", "description": "Speaking in Minnesota, Trump stoked local resentment with his supporters.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/c0Ygph1ISZqrm-KorIHHJC4JvMA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XJ3GBDHMEMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
