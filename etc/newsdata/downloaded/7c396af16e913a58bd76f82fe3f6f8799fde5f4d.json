Susceptibility to soft scald injury, a skin problem that can develop during cold storage, and bitter pit disorder linked to calcium deficiency make the fruit problematic.\n\nDevelopers in Washington note that the new Cosmic Crisp is more robust and easier to harvest, and can be stored for up to a year.\n\nLarge crunch\n\nGrowers and horticulturalists hope apple lovers will take to the new apple.\n\n\u201cThe Cosmic Crisp is extremely juicy and crispy with a large crunch where the texture fractures in your mouth,\u201d said Kathryn Grandy, director of marketing and operations at Proprietary Variety Management, a fruit marketing company.\n\n\u201cPeople talk about sweet or tart, but the Cosmic Crisp has high level of sugar and equally high level of tartness, which gives it a more interesting, complex flavor,\u201d Grandy said.\n\nThe apple\u2019s acidity makes it slower to brown when sliced, which makes it a good apple for cooking or eating raw, she said.\n\nThe apple\u2019s official name is WA 38, but focus groups brainstormed the name \u201cCosmic Crisp\u201d after observing how the apple\u2019s white lenticels, or pores, contrasted with its deep-red skin and \u201clook like the night sky,\u201d Grandy said.\n\nCosmic Crisp\u2019s $10 million marketing campaign budget over five years is like a Supernova compared to other apple rollouts. Marketing includes high-budget videos, celebrity baking demonstrations, social media marketing and trademarked slogans like \u201cthe Apple of Big Dreams.\u201d\n\nFor example, to cultivate the school lunchbox crowd, Cosmic Crisp is sponsoring the Missoula Children\u2019s Theater\u2019s traveling production of the historic American story of Johnny Appleseed. Schoolchildren and parents munch on prepackaged apple slices at performances.\n\nAnd in late August, the program brought aboard six influencers, including retired astronaut and International Space Station commander Leroy Chiao, to tour the country and visit private events to publicize the new apple. They also will promote Cosmic Crisp via social media.\n\nAbout 450,000 boxes of Cosmic Crisp apples will ship to big grocery retailers such as Walmart, Kroger and Costco starting in December, Proprietary Variety Management said.\n\nProducers plan to ramp up to 5.6 million boxes in 2021 and 21.4 million boxes by 2026.\n\nToo many choices\n\nCosmic Crisp\u2019s marketers say consumer confusion exists over the many apple choices, and this new campaign will develop a consumer \u201crelationship\u201d with Cosmic Crisp.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make this a global brand,\u201d said Lynnell Brandt, president of Proprietary Variety Management and Brandt\u2019s Fruit Trees in Yakima, Wash.\n\nSome 40 new types of apple compete in the marketplace \u2014 a number that is overloading consumers, he said.\n\nIndeed, others have tried to improve the Honeycrisp over the years.\n\nNew York-based Snapdragon and RubyFrost apples, both bred from Honeycrisps, were introduced in about seven years ago. Developed by horticulturalists at Cornell University, they are licensed in New York state to growers for a $1-per-tree royalty.\n\nThe Midwest Apple Improvement Association rolled out EverCrisp apples, another Honeycrisp hybrid, in 2016. Producers hope to plant 1 million trees in the next few years.\n\nThe University of Minnesota helped develop SweeTango apples, which are marketed by a collective of family-owned growers.\n\n\u201cIt used to take up to 40 years to develop a new variety of apple,\u201d said Susan Brown, the Cornell horticulturalist who developed Snapdragon and RubyFrost. Now a new variety can be developed in 15 to 20 years, she said.\n\nBrown also is writing a history of the American apple.\n\n\u201cThere has to be marketing because every time a grower is promoting variety, he\u2019s got a lot of invested in the land and trellises and trees. Growers don\u2019t want to put years of growing time into an apple that no one knows anything about,\u201d Brown said.\n\nWord of mouth\n\nThe Honeycrisp, developed in 1991 by horticulturalists at University of Minnesota, was a specialty apple sold on farm stands in the Midwest, Brown said.\n\n\u201cIt was so much a unique situation because the crispness and texture really got consumers without a marketing push. Honeycrisp spread by word of mouth and rose to a giant contender within the industry,\u201d she said. Growers rushed to produce the fruit, which was not necessarily suited to growing seasons and climates across the United States, Brown said.\n\nNow, tree fruit engineers are trying to perfect the Honeycrisp.\n\nCosmic Crisp is vital to the state of Washington\u2019s apple growers because the state\u2019s flagship apple, the Red Delicious, is losing popularity, Proprietary Variety Management\u2019s Brandt said. Many consumers have rejected the thick-skinned, mealy Red Delicious in favor of more flavorful varieties,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the 1980s, 75 percent of Washington\u2019s apples grown were Red Delicious. As consumers turned away, the industry fell into crisis. In 2000, President Bill Clinton signed an emergency Washington apple-farmer bailout that gave each grower an average of $30,000 to save the industry.\n\nWashington is the top-producing apple state in the country, with four times as much orchard acreage as second-place New York, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Michigan is the third top-producer. Apple growing in Washington was a $2.4 billion industry in 2017, the agency said.\n\nWashington apple growers have gone all-in on the Cosmic Crunch, ripping out orchards of Golden Delicious and Red Delicious and planting almost 12 million of the Cosmic Crunch trees, which are patented and can be grown exclusively in Washington for 10 years.\n\nFarmers pay a $1 royalty to Washington State University per tree and 4.25 percent of sales per box over $20.\n\nFarmers are hope the Cosmic Crisp can maintain a high price as a premium apple, which can fetch between $50 and $60 per box, as opposed to commodity apples, which can sell for as low as $15 a box. Lower-priced apples that don\u2019t make the cut for grocery stores are used for juice or are processed for applesauce.\n\nTariffs cut apple exports\n\nAgricultural tariffs are exerting pressure on apple farmers this year. Thirty percent of Washington\u2019s apples were produced for export with a high percentage going to India, China and Mexico, Brandt said. India, until recently, still imported lots of Red Delicious apples. But India slapped a 70 percent tariff on apples this year.\n\nAlso hurting apple growers are agricultural reprisals from a trade war with China and reduced exports to Mexico.\n\nThat\u2019s all the more reason that Cosmic Crisps need to succeed to help Washington\u2019s farmers, Brandt said.\n\nBut apple growers in other parts of the country worry that Cosmic Crisp\u2019s massive entry into the market will create a meteor blast, causing the extinction of locally produced fruit.\n\n\u201cApple industries are going to be competing more than they ever have for shelf space and price space at the grocery store. I worry that small producers will take the brunt of this,\u201d Cornell\u2019s Brown said. More than 670 family-owned apple farms operate in New York, she said.\n\n\u201cWhen you think of the carbon footprint and you buy local apples, you\u2019re supporting our beautiful family farms, some of which are fourth- or fifth-generation,\u201d Brown said. She noted the the Red Delicious also rose to prominence in the mid-20th century after a nationwide marketing campaign.\n\n\u201cI wish Cosmic Crisp all the best, but I hope consumers will remember local apples are supporting an industry,\u201d she said.\n\nProprietary Variety Management\u2019s Brandt said Cosmic Crisp\u2019s expansion plan was not meant to drive out family-farm apple growers.\n\n\u201cWe are not there to chase everybody else out \u2014 that\u2019s not it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are there to be as successful as we can be.\u201d\n\nCosmic Crisp plans to spread marketing internationally to such areas as Europe, South Africa, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, China and Korea, Brandt said.\n\nBut ultimately in the United States, it will be apple lovers who decide the success of the Cosmic Crisp, an industry spokeswoman said.\n\n\u201cRight now, no one can see what is going to happen with Cosmic Crisp,\u201d said Tracy Grondine, director of communications for the U.S. Apple Association. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what consumers are going to like and where it goes from there.\u201d\u2018", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 Washington state, the largest apple producer in the United States, soon will introduce a new variety that developers believe could", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
