In addition, staffers who were pressured by King to leave would be allowed to return to work, employees would not be required to chauffeur King around in their personal vehicles without compensation and King\u2019s wife, 1199 SEIU employee Neva Shillingford-King, would be prohibited from conducting Council business.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nKing was the lone vote opposed to the resolution.\n\n\u201cAs for Council Member King, I deplore his cowardice and disdain with which he treated his staff, the committee and this entire body,\" Council Speaker Corey Johnson said on the floor of the chambers. \u201cThis conduct merits sanctions of the magnitude that we can be sure will serve as a significant deterrent, while fully protecting the staff that that been through so much, and that allows for the swift detection of any bad behavior that might occur which could result in even harsher sanctions.\"\n\nOn the floor Monday and following the vote, King denied the allegations in the report and said that he was not given adequate time to prepare a defense, echoing statements he made over the weekend. The lawmaker has filed a lawsuit, and has referred to the inquiry as an execution, a lynching and a crucifixion.\n\n\u201cI am so bothered that I am being put in this situation, and acting like I\u2019m some horrible individual,\" said King, who maintained that he treats staff with respect.\n\nKing urged his colleagues to vote against the measures. None of them did.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not being treated fairly. It\u2019s not right what\u2019s happening here. And I don\u2019t want people making emotional decisions when due process has been violated,\" he said. \"I\u2019m asking you for your support as someone who was duly elected as you are.\"\n\nCouncil members Inez Barron and I. Daneek Miller both abstained.\n\nIn the hours leading up to the vote, King\u2019s attorneys filed a lawsuit in Manhattan state court alleging that his due process rights were violated when the Committee on Standards and Ethics and the special prosecutor Carrie Cohen did not give the lawmaker and his attorneys adequate time to mount a defense.\n\n\u201cCouncil Member King hasn\u2019t had a chance to tell his side of the story. He hasn\u2019t had a chance to answer the allegations,\u201d his lawyer, Pamela Hayes, said Saturday at a press conference. \u201cAnd you just have to give a person due process. That is what New York is about.\u201d\n\nHowever, Council Member Steven Matteo, chair of the committee, said Monday that King\u2019s lawyers deliberately avoided coming in so they could argue later that his due process rights were denied.\n\n\"There are most definitely examples of due process being violated by individuals not being afforded a fair chance to defend themselves \u2014 this is unequivocally not one of those cases,\u201d Matteo said. \u201cCouncil Member King was afforded every opportunity to defend himself and present his side of the story, and squandered all of them.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, a former staffer, whose harassment claims were substantiated by the City Council during King's first turn in front of the committee in 2017, called for King's expulsion in an opinion piece, something that Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer had said last week.\n\nVan Bramer attempted to make good on his pledge by introducing a motion to expel King from the body during Monday's meeting of the full Council, sending the proceedings into a lengthy detour while the body voted. A handful of members joined Van Bramer, including several likely competitors in the Queens borough president race, but the motion was ultimately defeated.\n\nThe suite of punishments are set to take effect immediately. A monitor that will be funded by taxpayers for the remainder of King\u2019s term is scheduled to arrive at his office Tuesday and will be in charge of all hiring and firing decisions, will have access to the office\u2019s email accounts and attend staff meetings. None of those are to be held at King\u2019s house \u2014 a reference to some of the charges contained in the committee\u2019s 48-page report that was first obtained by POLITICO last week.\n\nIn it, the committee laid out a series of ethics violations that played out over a number of years. King\u2019s wife, for example, was allowed to direct Council staff and make hiring and firing decisions, in several instances brought friends and colleagues from her union into the office. King and his wife also used Council resources to carry out and support a retreat in the Virgin Islands that promoted the union and included the wedding of Shillingford-King\u2019s daughter.\n\nKing also allegedly allowed one of his staffers to physically intimidate others in the office. And during a June 2015 meeting, the report argues he compared a picture from the city\u2019s Pride Parade to child pornography.\n\nOnce the committee began investigating King, the Council found that he retaliated against staffers, at one point keeping them at a meeting in his house until those who had been cooperating with the probe revealed themselves. Three members admitted talking to investigators. And in response, they allegedly suffered a series of retributions.\n\n\u201cIt brought us to tears of what [King's staff] had to go through. Nobody should have to go through that. Nobody should have to get up in the morning and dread going to work because they were going to be ridiculed, punished, threatened, anything that could harm them,\u201d said Council Member Karen Koslowitz, who sits on the ethics committee.\n\n\u201cFor the next two years and two months, Andy King will remember what he did,\" she later added.\n\nWith the vote behind them, the fate of King now lies with a Manhattan judge, who could decide to bring the process to a halt while determining the question of whether King was afforded a fair chance to respond.", "description": "King was the lone vote opposed to the resolution.", "authors": ["Joe Anuta"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/df/0d/ae4ad6f443ae88edf869fad19f9c/gettyimages-king-900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
