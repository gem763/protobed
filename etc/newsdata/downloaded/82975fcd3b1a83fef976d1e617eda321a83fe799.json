Will Ian Brown be coming to his show?\n\nI\u2019m in an enormous, concrete, box-shaped space. Alone, but the noise of men working nearby \u2013 drilling, talking \u2013 reverberates around the room. Literally an echo chamber. On the walls rest huge, colourful paintings, ready to be hung. Figures that are lifelike but messed with, so that bits are in the wrong place, or the background appears within the boundaries of the figures, a jigsaw forced together the wrong way.\n\nThe artist, John Squire, comes in quietly (he does everything quietly, he used to be much louder) and explains how he did it. It starts with a photo \u2013 perhaps one he\u2019s found on Tumblr, or taken himself (this one is his wife, at the basin in the bathroom at home near Macclesfield) \u2013 which he then manipulates.\n\nDamien Hirst introduced him to the Snapchat collage tool and Squire became entranced with it, initially as an entertaining distraction, then as a way of creating art. These ones are done with photo editing software called Magic Eraser, but it\u2019s the same kind of idea. Then, when he likes what he\u2019s got on his smartphone, he paints it, in oil. Big. Hirst encouraged him to go big. The big space for Squire\u2019s show is Hirst\u2019s Newport Street Gallery in Vauxhall, South London. The show is called Disinformation. \u201cIt struck me while I was doing the show and watching the news, I saw there was a parallel between confusing the message figuratively and with regards to information,\u201d says Squire.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Strung along \u2026 One of Squire\u2019s paintings at his Disinformation show. Photograph: \u00a9 John Squire\n\nNow we\u2019re standing in front of a distorted, fragmented monochrome guitarist whose face has been obscured by geometric wallpaper. Squire is not certain who the original picture is of. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a famous person, I\u2019m pretty sure not,\u201d he says. \u201cIt reminded me of posing around with guitars or tennis rackets as a kid, imagining stardom.\u201d Stardom which became a reality.\n\nSquire used to play guitar in a band. Play guitar quite well, in quite a big band: the Stones Roses. You know how it went: friends since bonding over the Clash at school in Altrincham, Squire and Ian Brown spent much of the 80s messing with styles and lineups and everything else. They gained momentum and a following before bursting beyond Manchester with a debut that encapsulated 1989 in vinyl, which often tops lists of the greatest British albums and played a significant part in the youth of a generation. Then a big gap, fighting with record companies, with each other, babies, Second Coming, mixed reviews, more fighting, accusations and allegations, fallouts and walk-outs, the end, solo projects, art \u2026 until, after an even longer gap, the reformation in 2012, a tour, then another end.\n\nIs that really it for the Roses? \u201cYeah,\u201d he says.\n\nHow is it with Ian? They had a pact when they reformed not to talk about all that, he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to honour that.\u201d\n\nWill he be coming to the opening of the show? \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nIs he invited? \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nIs anyone? \u201cI invited Mani [bassist Gary Mounfield], I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nSquire isn\u2019t super eager to talk about the Roses. It\u2019s always the same when he is interview for a show, he says. He gets asked \u201ca couple of questions about the work, then they get down to the serious business of finding out what the scoop is on the band\u201d.\n\nGuilty as charged. But that\u2019s because of their extraordinary enduring appeal, and the pivotal part they played in the coming-of-age for pretty much an entire generation. How does he see it now, looking back through the filter of time? \u201cIt was quite a brief period that gets a lot of attention still,\u201d he says. \u201cI was surprised at the level of support we got when we got back on stage.\u201d\n\nIf it sounds awkward \u2026 well it is a bit. But it\u2019s never unbearably uncomfortable. We sit down on chairs in the corner, he pours water politely. Later he apologises when he drinks straight from the bottle without thinking. Without thinking is out of character for John Squire, I think.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Detail from The Way Things Aren\u2019t (2018) by John Squire. Photograph: \u00a9 John Squire\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be difficult,\u201d he says.\n\nFifty-six and still pretty lugubrious, he often pauses before saying something or answering a question. They can be quite long pauses, but they become less and less awkward. I\u2019m not getting that Stone Roses scoop, that\u2019s clear, but the subject isn\u2019t totally off-limits \u2013 music and art have been there throughout the years after all.\n\nThe painting came first. His mum kept a few things he did with felt tips as a kid: a polar bear, Greek soldiers, shields and spears. \u201cI didn\u2019t really become aware that art could be something enjoyed second hand until punk rock.\u201d\n\nRecord sleeves? \u201cYeah, and clothes. The paint drips, that was a stepping-stone to abstract expressionism, then \u2018who is Jackson Pollock?\u2019, and I can use this to make my own record sleeves.\u201d Which he did, spattering Stone Roses covers with Pollock\u2019s influence.\n\nSquire did art A-level at college. He failed it, \u201cbecause I wasn\u2019t at all interested in the written work, the art history. This idea that museums were filled with dark religious paintings with a high-gloss finish, it made me feel depressed, reminded me of being forced to go to Sunday school.\u201d\n\nMainly self-taught then, same as with the guitar, no? \u201cI did go to some lessons with a piano teacher. I took him the only sheet music I could find, which was Rich Kids by the Rich Kids. He tried to play it on the piano and it sounded nothing like the record. I think I had one lesson and realised it wasn\u2019t going to help me get anywhere. So yeah, I learnt from books.\u201d\n\nAnd became very good at it, particularly on the heavy extended riffs of Second Coming. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s flattering, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a very good guitar player, or a very good painter. I listen to my guitar playing, my songs, I look at my paintings, I tend to focus on the faults, things that I could\u2019ve done slightly better.\u201d He points to a couple of fingers on the manipulated woman in the third panel of the triptych behind us that he\u2019s not happy with. With more time he would have made those fingers better.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Squire beside one of his works. Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian\n\nWhether it\u2019s a song or a picture, the thrill for Squire is the initial impetus of an idea more than the finished result. With a record, \u201cthere\u2019s so much repetition \u2013 because of the recording process, mixing, mastering \u2013 the material wears thin by the time it\u2019s released.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t listen to any of the records he\u2019s made \u2013 Stone Roses, Seahorses, his solo stuff \u2013 but he hasn\u2019t given the music up. He takes breaks from the work in the studio at his farm in Cheshire and picks up his guitar, writes songs, records songs. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do with it; only his wife has heard them.\n\nDoes he like working alone? \u201cYeah, I find it very therapeutic. You\u2019re not part of a committee, there is purity to that. But sometimes sharing the workload can be a rewarding experience.\u201d\n\nAs well as the rows, it must have been a laugh as well, being in the Stone Roses. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t spend much time laughing while I paint.\u201d\n\nHis old band don\u2019t just live on for nostalgic fiftysomethings. Their sons \u2013 and daughters \u2013 are discovering them too. Squire\u2019s own 16-year-old daughter recently showed him a picture of her friend getting a tattoo of his own Stone Roses lemon motif. \u201cMy reaction wasn\u2019t \u2018yay!\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt guilty in a way because I knew they were the same age as Martha.\u201d\n\nSquire has six children, between seven and 26, some of whom have followed similar paths to their dad. His eldest daughter went to art school and now makes feminist comics. His eldest son is in a band. He\u2019s been to see them a few times. \u201cI should go more often, but it\u2019s too loud.\u201d", "description": "He helped create the fist-pumping soundtrack of a generation \u2013 now he\u2019s painting pictures he makes on Snapchat.
