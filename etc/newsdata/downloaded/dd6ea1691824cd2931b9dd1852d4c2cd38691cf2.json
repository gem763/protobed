Five people have been arrested since Thursday, mostly for trespassing. Meanwhile, thousands of others are celebrating their love of UFOs at a number of festivals in the Nevada desert.\n\nThe events have been mostly festive, with crowds numbering in the low thousands and few arrests, officials said. Several minor injuries were reported, and one man was treated for dehydration by festival medics in Rachel before returning to the party.\n\nWhile costumed space aliens were a common, dayglow, and sometimes hilarious sight, no one reported seeing actual extraterrestrials or UFOs.\n\n\"There's a great sense of community among everyone here,\" said John Derryberry, who drove with his girlfriend, Sarah Shore, from Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n\"It started as a joke and now people are getting to know each other,\" said Tracy Ferguson, 23, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He said the internet gave him the idea to drive to Nevada with his girlfriend, Jade Gore, 19, of Worthington, Minnesota.\n\nAlmost 100 people went at 3 a.m. Friday to the best-known \"back gate\" of the legendary former top-secret U.S. Air Force base, near the tiny town of Rachel, and another 40 made a more difficult trek to a lesser-known gate in Tikaboo Valley, Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee said.\n\nAbout 300 went to the Tikaboo gate during daylight, and another 800 people made the dusty 8-mile drive to the Rachel gate during the day, Lee said.\n\nA man reported missing Friday morning after heading Thursday from a festival campground in Hiko toward an Area 51 gate was found safe Friday evening, Lee said. Details weren't immediately made public, but his disappearance was not believed to have been an abduction.\n\nAlien-hunters gather near an entrance to the military facility near Rachel, Nevada on September 20, 2019.

Authorities were trying to determine how to tow their vehicle out of the rugged area.\n\nThe gates are marked by bright floodlights, watchful cameras and, at the Rachel gate, a squat tan bunker building with blackout windows \u2014 all surrounded by razor wire.\n\nThe sheriff in neighboring Nye County reported that about 40 people dispersed after \"heated warnings\" from officers about 3 a.m. Friday near a base gate not far from a conspicuously green \"Area 51 Alien Center\" about 90 minutes' drive west of Las Vegas.\n\nMatty Roberts, a 20-year-old from Bakersfield, California, who sparked the Area 51 phenomenon with a late-night Facebook post in June and then broke with Little A'Le'Inn owner Connie West overproduction of the Rachel event, hosted a Thursday evening event at an outdoor venue in downtown Las Vegas \u2014 also using the \"Alienstock\" name.\n\nAttendees listen to music during Alienstock festival on the \"Extraterrestrial Highway in Rachel, Nevada on September 20, 2019.

Business owner George Harris said he expected a crowd of 5,000, but Lee said the audience and nearby campers appeared to number in the hundreds.\n\nCyril Soudant, 25, of Lille, France, said at the Rachel gate that he was disappointed not to see more people.\n\nSoudant shot videos for his YouTube channel and said he would wait until Friday night to make a final assessment about the experience. \"We all know we can't cross the gate,\" Soudant said. \"But if tonight we get together, have some music, have some beers, that would be a success.\"", "description": "Thousands celebrated their love of UFOs at a number of festivals in the Nevada desert", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/20/04c45d1f-bf0c-4486-989c-4b72423bd730/thumbnail/1200x630/ece04397836df5c19d16e8280f224170/area-51-gettyimages-1169830898.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
