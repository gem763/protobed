Little Landon was not going to cash in today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut not if Curt could help it. He decided to write a \u2018verification\u2019 letter to the tooth fairy to appeal to her better nature.\n\nHe even cheekily reminded her about some money she owed him from 1987.\n\nLet\u2019s hope she replied (Picture: Beth Schultz)\n\nIn the letter addressed to the tooth fairy, Curt pulled out all the stops.\n\nMaking it as official as possible, he added the school\u2019s letterhead and signed it off.\n\nIn it, he wrote: \u2018Dear Tooth Fairy, today [Landon] lost a tooth while playing outside at recess.\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, it was lost in our ga-ga pit, and despite the valiant efforts of an intrepid search team, we were unable to recover the tooth.\n\n\u2018As a trained principal and hobby dentist, I can verify that there is definitely a gap in [Landon]\u2019s teeth that was not there this morning when he came in.\u2019\n\nHe continued: \u2018Please accept this letter as official verification of a lost tooth and provide the standard monetary exchange rate you normally use for a real tooth.\u2019\n\nCurt\u2019s postscript was also pretty hilarious as he wrote: \u2018I am still waiting for the money for my wisdom teeth from 1987. Please remit as soon as possible.\u2019\n\nCome to think of it, there may be some owed payment around the \u201995 era too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Headteacher writes children\u2019s books to fund her school after budget cuts\n\nMORE: Little boy with Down\u2019s Syndrome nicknamed \u2018Smiley Riley\u2019 lands work as a model\n\nMORE: Teacher writes sweet note to the tooth fairy to prove her student lost a tooth\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Principle Curt Angeli stepped in on behalf of the first-grader at Gillett Elementary in Wisconsin.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90860343_1571584861.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
