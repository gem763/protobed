Funds from the two-year grant, awarded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, will be used to establish a national education reporting team at USA TODAY that will collaborate with its NETWORK journalists across the country.\n\nOnce established, the team will provide national context to developments in primary, secondary and higher education. It will watchdog state-level education efforts and highlight success stories, connecting the dots for parents and policymakers.\n\nThe team\u2019s efforts will leverage the contributions of education reporters throughout the NETWORK with the goal of improving public discussion and debate on critical education issues. Those issues include improving student achievement, teacher development and training and transitioning students from K-12 to post-secondary education.\n\n\u201cUSA TODAY NETWORK is uniquely positioned to report on issues affecting students and parents across the country,\u201d said Randy Lovely, vice president for community news at USA TODAY NETWORK. \u201cWith reporters at the local level working with the enhanced national team made possible by the Gates Foundation grant, our reporting will provide an extensive view of the state of education in the U.S.\u201d\n\nThe work of the USA TODAY education reporting team will be conducted independently of the Gates Foundation; the foundation will not influence content or provide editorial input.\n\nLeading USA TODAY\u2019s education team is Chrissie Thompson, who is based in Spokane, Washington. Thompson is a veteran reporter and editor who covered politics for the Cincinnati Enquirer and the auto industry for the Detroit Free Press. She served as an editor on The Enquirer\u2019s \u201cSeven Days of Heroin\u201d project that won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting.\n\nThompson holds a master\u2019s degree in higher education administration from the University of Michigan and earned her undergraduate degree in media communication from Taylor University. The team will also include two reporting positions which will be funded with proceeds from the grant.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/pr/2018/11/15/usa-today-network-expand-coverage-education-issues/2011035002/", "description": "USA TODAY NETWORK will bolster coverage of education issues.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published A.M.
