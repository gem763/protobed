And now, Williams is apologizing for it.\n\n\u201cI was also born in a different era,\u201d Williams told GQ, \u201cwhere the rules of the matrix at that time allowed a lot of things that would never fly today. Advertisements that objectify women. Song content. Some of my old songs, I would never write or sing today. I get embarrassed by some of that stuff. It just took a lot of time and growth to get to that place.\u201d\n\nNow, Williams says that \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d led to a feminist epiphany.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get it at first. Because there were older white women who, when that song came on, they would behave in some of the most surprising ways ever. And I would be like, wow. They would have me blushing,\u201d the Grammy-winner said. \u201cSo, when there started to be an issue with it, lyrically, I was, like, What are you talking about? There are women who really like the song and connect to the energy that just gets you up. And I know you want it \u2014 women sing those kinds of lyrics all the time. So, it\u2019s like, What\u2019s rapey about that?\u201d\n\nWilliams claims that he understands that men use this language when they are abusing women.\n\n\u201cI realized that there are men who use that same language when taking advantage of a woman, and it doesn\u2019t matter that that\u2019s not my behavior. Or the way I think about things. It just matters how it affects women,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201cAnd I was like, Got it. I get it. Cool. My mind opened up to what was actually being said in the song and how it could make someone feel. Even though it wasn\u2019t the majority, it didn\u2019t matter,\u201d Williams insisted. \u201cI cared what they were feeling too. I realized that we live in a chauvinist culture in our country. Hadn\u2019t realized that. Didn\u2019t realize that some of my songs catered to that. So that blew my mind.\u201d\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Super-producer Pharrell Williams says he's changed his mind and is apologizing for the \"chauvinist\" masculinity and sexism in his hit 2013 song \"Blurred Lines.\"", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/pharrellwilliams1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
