The Mosaic actress looked youthful for Harper's Bazaar Spain 's November issue where she modeled several white outfits and talked about getting back to who she was before fame\n\n'I think Einstein was really bright about time - time is something we made up so we can find each other,' she began in the clip as she wore a Harper's Bazaar T-shirt.\n\n'We live in more than the three dimensions,' added the mother of three. 'And time moves in more than these ways... time is am ambiguous construct and an ephemeral construct.\n\n'What I am coming to understand as I get older is I am coming back to my core personality that I had - as a younger person - because that is more the truth of my personality.\n\n'The things that tried to be tamped down, like your anti social parts, are you great talents and great gifts,' said the cover girl.\n\n'It's just a mistake to blend and try to be like everyone else because it's the things that make us different that are our gifts. Life is like one giant puzzle and if you don't expand to the fullest of yourself you don't really click in to the puzzle piece that is waiting for you.'\n\nStone also discussed beauty.\n\n'We see beauty in so may ways in nature - we have to be willing to not fall to the commercialization of beauty as only one thing,' noted the star who has topped many Most Beautiful lists.\n\n'I love the way, especially now in fashion, we are starting to see women of all kinds of beauty.\n\n'We need to accept beauty in all of its forms.'\n\nShe added she feels 'blessed' and has been through a long period of change that 'has lasted almost a couple of decades' and she is coming out the other side of it, 'like a caterpillar, starting to get wings again.'\n\nSharon also talked about her life pre-stroke when she was in blockbuster movies like Sliver, Sphere and The Quick And The Deal.\n\n'It was hard for me to understand that the kind of butterfly that I was before was over,' she noted.\n\n'There is a great saying in Africa, with my hut burning down now I can see the stars.'\n\nDaring: In 1992 her film Basic Instinct with Michael Douglas came out and she shot to fame\n\nStone said she can now see clearly, she had made herself in to that other thing, she is now taking flight.'\n\nAnd Sharon shared that she is having 'tons of dreams' where she flies. 'It's been thrilling to be in this place where I feel so free and so happy and so healed.'\n\nThe star had one cover while former Bond girl Carole Bouquet, Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown actress Rossy de Palma and Mafalda also had covers for the Fabulous Women issue.\n\nBasic truth: Playing sexy but psychotic author Catherine Trammel shot her to fame instantly. The film was full of cocaine, nudity and sexiness. And Sharon thinks it could not be made today\n\n'November is presented differently, not only in terms of figures, this time there are four and not one of the covers of the publication, but also in content,' the magazine said.\n\n'Along with Sharon Stone are @rossydpalma, @mafalda and Carole Bouquet forming the so-called 'Fabulous Women', great style icons that have marked different generations and that claim the real beauty in this new issue.\n\n'And it is inevitable to talk about beauty and not name one of the icons of the last decades, @sharonstone, who at 61 years gives us this fantastic editorial.'\n\nAnother big hit: She won rave reviews for her work in the 1995 Martin Scorsese film Casino\n\nSharon thanked her team online: 'Photographer: @juankr_ Style: @kristeningersoll Hair: @giannandreahair Makeup: @missjobaker Hair Colorist: @brooklynstephen @oscardelarenta.'\n\nThis follows another eye-opening interview.\n\nIn Allure's November issue cover profile, the star talked with journalist Danielle Pargament about being happier than ever with her shape as she posed in a black bra and undies. 'I like my body so much more.... I'm so grateful to my body,' said the Casino star.\n\nThe Sliver star was so happy with the article she wrote on Instagram: 'Thank you to Allure and in particular to writer, Danielle Pergament, who was present for a real conversation.'\n\n'When I was younger, everybody was telling me what was wrong with my body \u2014 too this, too that.\n\n'When I got on Basic Instinct, they hired a makeup artist that put on pounds of makeup every day, and every day I went to my trailer and took the makeup off.\n\n'But I wasn't allowed to choose my makeup artist, nor was my name [above the title] on the poster.'\n\nBasic Instinct came out in 1992 and was a blockbuster. Her costar was Michael Douglas. a film industry vet.\n\nPlaying sexy but psychotic author Catherine Trammel shot her to fame instantly.\n\nThe movie was considered very risque as it was full of cocaine, nudity (that open legs shot during her interrogation made headlines) and sex.\n\nAnd Sharon thinks it would not be made today.\n\n'I think Basic Instinct was made at the exact right moment in history because it captured all our fears and doubts and the moment of change of power for women,' said the mother of three.\n\n'It's still an intriguing film, but could it be made now? I doubt that it would have any form of the sensationalism it had at the time,' added the Pennsylvania native.\n\n'When I began my career, there were only two ways we were allowed to sit: cross at the ankles or ankles under the chair,' she said.\n\nInterestingly, her favorite age was her 40s, not her 20s and 30s.\n\n'My 40s were so beautiful. I couldn't work because women, once they got to be 40, were not given jobs in Hollywood,' she said.\n\n'I was a mom with three beautiful little boys. I was recovering from a massive brain injury, and I was in custody court constantly over my oldest child.\n\n'But there was something wonderful in that period of all those challenges. And even though no one wanted to date me \u2014 no one would want a woman that had little children \u2014 it was a period of reconciliation and change, and understanding myself. It was my period of the biggest change, but the period where I thought I was the most beautiful.'\n\nShe also touched on her stroke in 2001 which changed her life: 'I've been unbelievably famous.\n\nDone with criticism: 'When I was younger, everybody was telling me what was wrong with my body \u2014 too this, too that,' said the siren\n\n'And to go from that to the complete obscurity of neurological ICU \u2014 people don't know what it's like to learn that lesson, and the falsehoods of false power.'\n\nAnd Stone also confesses that she was warned fame would not last, though she has obviously proven that is not true as at 61 she is busier in Hollywood than ever. Next is the film What About Love and she is in two TV series: The New Pope and Ratched.\n\n'I was very lucky. So many of the women who had been famous before me were so good to me,' she said.\n\n'Faye [Dunaway] and Shirley MacLaine \u2014 they told me it won't last forever, enjoy every minute of it.'\n\nAnd Stone admits she is still working on herself: 'I think when I was young, it was my ambition. It was so intense. Taking off the tough veneer and telling the truth has been my latest mission.'\n\nAnd she also shared some wisdom for her fans: 'When we're young and we're so driven by the follies of our youth, sometimes we can miss some of the great beauty and wonder of the simplicity of every day.'", "description": "In an accompanying video, the 61-year-old movie icon talked about how she is going back to the 'truth of my core personality' and is embracing the person she was before she became a glamorous movie star.", "authors": ["Heidi Parker For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/18/20391138-0-image-a-53_1572461275967.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
