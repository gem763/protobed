Guiffre says the pair groomed her and forced her to have sex with Epstein and others as part of an elaborate sex ring, from which she escaped in 2002.\n\nFor years, Giuffre told her harrowing story to authorities, but justice remained elusive.\n\nIn 2017, however, Giuffre spoke with Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown and videographer Emily Michot and spoke out about the abuse. The journalists also interviewed fellow Epstein survivors Courtney Wild, Michelle Licata and Jena-Lisa Jones.\n\nThe result was a bombshell three-part investigation published last year that led to Epstein\u2019s arrest and the resignation of several government officials. Epstein killed himself in prison last August while awaiting trial.\n\nRELATED: Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Cause of Death Confirmed, Officially Declared a Suicide\n\nThe five women \u2014 the three Epstein survivors and the two journalists \u2014 are honored in PEOPLE\u2019s annual Women Changing the World edition.\n\nIn an interview with PEOPLE, Giuffre recalls the moment she learned of Epstein\u2019s arrest.\n\n\u2022 For more on the women who helped bring Jeffrey Epstein to justice and other women changing the world, subscribe now to PEOPLE or pick up this week\u2019s issue, on newsstands Friday.\n\n\u201cI started screaming, \u2018No way.
