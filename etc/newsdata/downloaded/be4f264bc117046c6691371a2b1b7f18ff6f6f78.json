Rather than kick a field goal that would have made it a one-possession game, Pederson called for a passing play.\n\nCarson Wentz connected with Nelson Agholor for the score to cut Philadelphia\u2019s deficit to 17-12.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEagles gamble while playing catchup\n\nWhat did Pederson do from there? Keep his foot on the gas, of course. With the prospect of a two-point conversion cutting Atlanta\u2019s edge to a field goal, Pederson dialed up a two-point play.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nWentz kept the ball on the conversion and dove toward the end zone with the ball outstretched toward the goal line. Officials signaled a successful conversion.\n\nBut they reviewed the play that saw Wentz hit the ground around the same time he crossed the goal line. They overturned the call on the field, ruling that Wentz\u2019s knee was down before the ball crossed the goal line.\n\nWhy was Wentz\u2019s conversion overruled?\n\nHe wasn\u2019t touched before the ball crossed, however, drawing confusion over why he was ruled down.\n\nNFL officiating executive Al Riveron explained the play, noting that Wentz gave himself up on the play, and that by rule, he was down when his knee touched the turf.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn #PHIvsATL, Philadelphia QB Carson Wentz was ruled short of the goal line, here\u2019s why: pic.twitter.com/6XsrJzOEwr \u2014 NFL Officiating (@NFLOfficiating) September 16, 2019\n\nWas it the right call?\n\nThe ruling is clear, but the rule itself is drawing debate. Wentz clearly wasn\u2019t attempting to down himself, so should he be ruled down without contact in that situation?\n\nOr is it right that the rule cuts both ways? If a players dives, leaving his intent up to the officials\u2019 discretion opens up the call to obvious problems. Reading minds shouldn\u2019t be part of a referee\u2019s job description, even when the intent of a play is as obvious as it is in this situation.\n\nEagles fans are surely pondering the reversal of a two-point conversion after Sunday's loss to the Falcons. (Getty)\n\nCall could have impacted game\u2019s outcome\n\nThe Falcons went on to win the game, 24-20, and a successful two-point conversion here could have had an impact on the outcome.\n\nThe Eagles briefly took the lead in the fourth quarter with a Wentz touchdown sneak. They successfully converted a two-point conversion to take a 20-17 lead.\n\nHad the earlier conversion been successful and Philadelphia opted for a traditional extra point on the Wentz touchdown sneak, they would have taken a 21-17 lead.\n\nThat would have given them the option to attempt a game-tying field goal in the red zone in the game\u2019s final moments, where, instead, they came up short on a fourth-down play to turn the ball over on downs while trailing by four.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s a lot of ifs, ands and buts in the larger scheme of a football game.\n\nBut Eagles fans are surely pondering the ruling after watching their team fall to 1-1.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Eagles fans are surely pondering the reversal of a two-point conversion after Sunday's loss to the Falcons.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/LkfVsBEseEBVoqY1ARwKwQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MTMuODY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zxj7D.ab4PmyK6_2X7dr2Q--~B/aD0xOTkyO3c9MzEzMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/25101cb0-d835-11e9-aefb-00535d99aa54", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
