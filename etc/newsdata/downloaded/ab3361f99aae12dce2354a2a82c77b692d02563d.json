Mr Dolgintsev\u2019s lawyer, Dmitry Sotnikov, said he intended to run an experiment to find out if the cat was capable of drug running.\n\nMr Sotnikov wanted to \u201cput a collar on the cat with a load equal to the weight of the narcotics, and then observe how it reacts,\u201d Kommersant quoted him as saying. \u201cThen we would have needed to throw him over the fence and see if he delivered the drugs to his designation.\u201d", "description": "A Russian cat slated to serve as the key piece of evidence in an ongoing drug smuggling case has disappeared, local media reported Wednesday, potentially undermining an investigation that centers on the cat\u2019s role as an alleged narco mule for a prison inmate.", "authors": ["Matthew Bodner", "Allister Heath", "Sherelle Jacobs", "Stephen Bush"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000213218883-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq5Kqmtk4PE6fnbZOiTj4d98MNoW8L8nkHiA4PKgRi4i8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
