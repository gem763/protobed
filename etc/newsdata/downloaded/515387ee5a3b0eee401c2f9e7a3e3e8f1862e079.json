Carrapateena won't be cash positive next year,'' he told analysts on Wednesday morning.\n\nRBC analyst Paul Hissey said OZ should be able to achieve its goal of continuing to pay dividends through the period it was spending on development of Carrapateena.\n\n''On our estimates, OZ can continue funding the remaining development capital (about $280 million) from its existing and operating cash flows,'' he said on Wednesday.", "description": "OZ Minerals sold more copper than it produced in the past three months, easing concerns about customer deferrals in early 2019.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_941%2C$y_126/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/45e87ee64e21dff5890a6a96f7bbe248cd2dea69", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
