Multiple studies are underway for a human exploration lander.'\n\n'We have the plan in front of ministers. If they make the right decisions we will hopefully get the first Europeans on the Moon.\n\n'Europe can punch above its weight on a global scale.'\n\nDavid Parker, the agency's Director of Human and Robotic Exploration, made the comments during a space conference in Wales earlier this week\n\nLanding on the moon and constructing a base in its orbit will be a vital step in the longer-term vision of landing humans on Mars, Dr Parker said.\n\n'Building a rocket to go to Mars is the least difficult bit,' he noted.\n\n'It's how to support humans, how physically you protect them from radiation.\n\n'So the Moon is a great place to prepare for deep space.'\n\nEuropean Space Agency contributing states will send representative ministers to Seville, Spain, on November 26, where final approval for the mission will be granted and funding approved.\n\nBritain will remain a participant in the agency, even in the event of the country's departure from the European Union.\n\n'We still have many challenges if we want to get a human on Mars one day,' Dr Parker concluded.\n\n'Mars has been waiting for us for three and half billion years, we have to get there.'", "description": "David Parker, the agency's Director of Human and Robotic Exploration, made the comments during a space conference in Wales earlier this week.
