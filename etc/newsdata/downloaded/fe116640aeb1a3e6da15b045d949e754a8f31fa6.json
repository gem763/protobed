Redlining, making sure that we are in a position where \u2013 look, talk about education. I proposed that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title I schools, triple the amount of money we spend.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe teachers \u2026 have every problem coming to them,\u201d Mr Biden continued. \u201cWe have to make sure that every single child does, in fact, have three, four, and five-year-olds go to school \u2013 school, not daycare, school. We bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help. They don\u2019t know quite what to do. Play the radio. Make sure the television \u2013 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake sure the kids hear words. A kid coming from a very school \u2013 a very poor background \u2013 will hear four million fewer words by the time they get there,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThose statements appeared to imply \u201cthat black parents don\u2019t know how to raise their own children,\u201d according to some, including Anand Giridharadas, an editor-at-large for TIME Magazine.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden\u2019s answer on how to address the legacy of slavery was appalling \u2013 and disqualifying,\u201d he wrote in a tweet.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, Mr Giridharadas added: \"Asked about his past comments denying responsibility, as a white man, for America's sins, he gives an answer insinuating that black parents don't know how to raise kids.\u201d\n\nHere is my transcript of Joe Biden's record player moment.\n\n\n\nAsked about his past comments denying responsibility, as a white man, for America's sins, he gives an answer insinuating that black parents don't know how to raise kids. pic.twitter.com/Z39NtsiVkd \u2014 Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) September 13, 2019\n\nOthers said Mr Biden was employing \u201ca racist stereotype\u201d when answering the question.\n\n\u201cSo many problems with this,\u201d Ashley Nicole Black, a comedian and cast member of HBO\u2019s A Black Lady Sketch Show, wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cHe repeated a racist stereotype (using a debunked study). He still has a record player ... But the pettiest problem ... Does Joe Biden think black parents don't play their kids music?? Has he MET black people?\u201d\n\nMr Biden continued on with his comments, despite going past the speaking time he was allotted, moving on to discuss foreign policy and the crisis in Venezuela.\n\nRead more\n\nBiden goes on the offensive amid intense clashes in Houston\n\n\u201cHere's the deal. The deal is we've got this a little backwards and by the way, in Venezuela ... we should be allowing people to come here from Venezuela,\" he continued, before incorrectly referring to the country\u2019s president, Nicolas Maduro, as \u2018Madura\u2019.", "description": "Taking several turns and going down multiple tangents, Joe Biden could not seem to answer a simple question about the legacy of slavery during the third Democratic debates.The former vice president mentioned record players, discussed education and talked about bringing social workers into homes in low-income", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Vpqj_x1HXL03LnUxnDjnzw--~B/aD0zMjQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/77153f2a2f566ab132e40b4be7b01ca5", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
