Photo: Caroline Brehman/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nBen: President Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion to Ukraine\u2019s president that he investigate Joe Biden, and whether he dangled money in exchange for such an investigation, is such egregious and obvious misconduct that some Democrats who had been on the fence about impeachment seem to be coming around; even Nancy Pelosi is gesturing that she might get there eventually. We here at Intelligencer HQ have not exactly been gung ho on impeachment \u2014 Jon and I have been opposed, and Eric has been in the middle \u2014 compared with the majority of Democrats who are all-in, according to polls. Does this change your thinking?\n\nJon: I am unsure but starting to move closer to pro-impeachment, though my position is in part an axiomatic response to what Congress thinks \u2014 the more Congress supports impeachment, the better an idea it is in my view.\n\nThe worst outcome would be an impeachment resolution that fails. Next worst, a resolution that gets 218 votes. At minimum, you need close to all the Democrats, plus Justin Amash, the one Republican who has supported impeachment. When you get close to unanimity among Democrats, that\u2019s when the idea hits a threshold of being a good idea. (That\u2019s my view, not saying that\u2019s the only view \u2014 others disagree).\n\nEric: I\u2019ve been agnostic on impeachment, on the grounds that whether or not it\u2019s a good idea depends almost entirely on whether it helps or hurts Trump\u2019s reelection prospects. And there is some reason to believe it would perversely help Trump on the margins \u2014 polls suggest impeachment is unpopular, particularly with the very strange subset of the population that still isn\u2019t sure which team it\u2019s on; Republicans did extremely poorly in that one midterm after impeaching Clinton. On the other hand, forcing Susan Collins to cast a vote directly abetting Trump\u2019s lawlessness could help Dems secure a critical Senate seat. And there are some plausible arguments out there that impeachment would create a media environment that would ultimately undermine Trump. In my view, it seems impossible for anyone to know exactly how all this would play out.\n\nAs Trump\u2019s high crimes and misdemeanors grow more numerous and audacious, the moralistic case for erring on the side of \u201cdoing your constitutional duty\u201d does get harder for me to dismiss, though.\n\nJon: I am still annoyed by the moralistic case. To me, it\u2019s 100 percent practical: If you think the result will help Trump hold power, do not do it, full stop. Now, that is a debatable thing, as you say. But the fact that people keep asserting moralistically that we must do it makes me very distrustful of the whole crusade. They\u2019re broadcasting that they don\u2019t care what the outcome is or that they don\u2019t see how morality could override the practical impact. In what world is \u201cWe helped Trump win, but we did the right thing\u201d a sensible argument that people would make after the 2020 election?\n\nEric: Yeah, I guess it\u2019s not the moralism I find compelling so much as \u2026 the possibility that the moralists may actually be right that pursuing impeachment would have an inhibiting effect on Trump\u2019s transgressions \u2014 if only because it would commandeer his attention, leaving less free time for crimes.\n\nJon: I agree, that is very possible.\n\nBen: Both of your points get to the heart of why I\u2019m struggling with this question. Before this latest revelation, I was anti-impeachment because (1) the majority of voters were not in favor of doing it, and it would likely alienate some of them, at least to an extent; (2) Trump will certainly be acquitted and have his triumphant moment; and (3) it is unlikely to make him any more unpopular, in my opinion, despite what pro-impeachment voices think. Those three objections still hold water, I think, but to just sit there while he openly undermines an upcoming election may be a bridge too far for me. I do think voters will understand going to war over this more than they do relitigating obstruction in a Russia investigation they never cared much about. So the practical case is slightly better than it was, and the moral case (sorry, Jon) is getting to be overwhelming. And there\u2019s the fact that I was never fully confident that impeachment would actually hurt a Democrat\u2019s reelection chances \u2014 nobody really knows.\n\nJon: Morals! [Spits on ground] I think the main hurt is the 40 Democratic seat-flippers. The presidential nominee would be fine, I think, but House members could get hurt for voting to impeach, which is why I think the right move is to listen to them (which Pelosi is obviously doing).\n\nEric: As the ranks of secretly anti-Trump retiring House Republicans multiply, I do wonder if a couple of them can be won over to Team Amash. It would help the Democrats message this.\n\nBen: Another practical argument is that this would focus attention on Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the election, which are likely to grow more and more intense. I think there\u2019s a definite upside to that.\n\nJon: That would matter. I don\u2019t see how impeachment prevents Trump from undermining the election, though.\n\nEric: Matt Yglesias mentioned this over the weekend, I think, but opposition parties in states ruled by corrupt/proto-authoritarian regimes often mobilize mass protests and civil disobedience to check the incumbents\u2019 power. Not sure whether that would in fact be a means of imposing a cost on Trump\u2019s lawlessness without jeopardizing incumbent Dems (not hard to imagine a case for why it\u2019d do neither of those things). But I think it is worth considering mechanisms for resistance beyond those suggested by our shitty Constitution\n\nBen: Eric \u201cSmash the State\u201d Levitz.\n\nEric: Or at least the Trump-owned properties.\n\nJon: Impeachment is too radical; revolution is the answer. Seriously, though, protesting the Trump properties seems like a no-brainer. Why don\u2019t people do that? Is there no space? (There is in D.C.!) I visited the Trump hotel there with my family last winter. I couldn\u2019t understand why there aren\u2019t crowds out there 24/7 screaming that the people inside are criminals.\n\nBen: At least give it a bad Yelp review.\n\nEric: Yeah, I feel like \u201cMake it harder for Trump to profit off the presidency by protesting constantly outside his clearly marked profit centers\u201d seems like a sound strategy.\n\nSoros and Steyer can pay the protesters.\n\nJon: My friend once mistakenly walked into a place in Brooklyn and was looking at a group of obvious mobsters. One of them said, \u201cYou\u2019re in the wrong place.\u201d And he scooted. I felt like the Trump Hotel should be like that. It\u2019s this notorious center of criminal activity. But you can just walk right in there. It\u2019s weird.\n\nBen: All right, back to impeachment. To what extent do you think elevating this story might backfire for Democrats, or at least for Joe Biden? While there\u2019s no hint of actual illegality in the Bidens\u2019 involvement with Ukraine, it\u2019s true that Joe\u2019s son was being paid $50,000 a month by a sketchy oligarch for services that are unclear. It gives off the appearance of garden-variety influence peddling, which is not generally popular among voters.\n\nJon: It\u2019s definitely true that every time Trump or his surrogates are asked about it, they respond with a soundbite attacking Biden, and the media carry those soundbites. So certainly it hurts Biden more than any other Democrat.\n\nEric: Yeah. And given that Warren has staked out a leadership position on impeachment while Biden has not, such a push could hurt him in more ways than one.\n\nBen: What about the substantive charges there, that Biden\u2019s family shouldn\u2019t have been involved with this stuff in the first place? Did he mess up in that regard?\n\nJon: Reportedly, Hunter took that job without ever consulting his father and/or Hunter is definitely a screwup, the Don Jr. of the Biden family, a ne\u2019er-do-well who just trades on his dad\u2019s name. The good news is that by all appearances, he is fooling clients into believing he has pull, of which there\u2019s no evidence.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s inevitable that impeachment is going to happen at this point?\n\nJon: No, not at all. The clock is ticking, and once the campaign is underway I think it gets harder.\n\nBen: Of course we also don\u2019t have the full details of what really happened on this phone call, etc.\n\nJon: Thursday\u2019s hearing will be important.\n\nEric: Yeah, at this point, it\u2019s not clear that the news cycle won\u2019t digest this Ukraine thing in a week\u2019s time. When and if the news moves on, I imagine the impeachment talk will lose momentum. Remember when the fact that Saudi Arabia openly killed a Washington Post columnist was supposed to somehow change our relationship with its government?\n\nJon: The whistle-blower report is a hook. That keeps the story going. My guess is they release a transcript, possibly edited, and not the full report to see if it goes away.\n\nEric: Plausible.\n\nBen: I want to get you both on the record, right now, on Monday, September 23. Where exactly do you stand on impeachment?\n\nJon: Still opposed but now impeachment-curious.\n\nEric: \ud83e\udd37", "description": "Intelligencer staffers discuss whether the Ukraine scandal is reason enough to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Trump.", "authors": ["Jonathan Chait", "Benjamin Hart", "Eric Levitz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/23/23-nancy-pelosi.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
