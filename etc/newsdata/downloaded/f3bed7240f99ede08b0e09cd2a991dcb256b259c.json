This isn't quite a followup to our favorite Android phone of the year, the OnePlus 7 Pro, but it takes the same basic package and trims it down for a more mainstream audience.\n\nThe OnePlus 7T is $599, leaving only $70 of difference between it and the 7 Pro. Naturally, there aren't a lot of differences between the OnePlus 7 Pro and this new OnePlus 7T. As far the design goes, the 7 Pro's party trick pop-up camera has been swapped out for OnePlus' tried-and-true water drop notch. In the past, OnePlus' notch design has been one of the most compact and unobtrusive in the industry, and for the 7T, OnePlus says the notch is now 34 percent smaller than the OnePlus 6T's version. The back has gotten a design tweak, too, with the camera components now living in a big circle.\n\nThe display is a 6.55-inch, 2400\u00d71080 OLED panel. This is slightly less than the 6.67-inch, 1440p panel on the 7 Pro, and the 7T panel is also flat, instead of curved along the sides on the Pro. The new panel is still 90Hz, though, bringing the 7 Pro's best feature to an ever-so-slightly-smaller price point. The phone body is also a tiny bit smaller: 160.94mm \u00d7 74.4mm for the 7T compared to 162.6mm \u00d7 75.9mm for the 7 Pro.\n\nThe SoC gets an upgrade to Qualcomm's latest, the Snapdragon 855+, offering a small processor speed bump over the Pro's regular 855. The SoC is paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB of UFS 3.0 storage. There's still an in-screen fingerprint reader, a USB-C port on the bottom, and dual stereo speakers. Still missing are a headphone jack and wireless charging. OnePlus says the phone is still somewhat water-resistant, but it's not providing exact IPXX numbers that spell out how much water the device can handle.\n\nFor camera's, there's a 48MP main camera, a 8MP 2x telephoto, and a 16MP wide-angle, while the front gets a 16MP selfie cam. There is some new camera software to play with, though, like the inclusion of a new macro mode.\n\nThe 3800mAh battery is 200mAh smaller than the 7 Pro, but it charges 23 percent faster than the 7 Pro thanks to \"Warp Charge 30T.\" OnePlus says the battery will charge from zero to 70 percent in a half-hour now, thanks to a revamped battery structure. If you have an old Warp Charge 30 charger from the 7 Pro, it's actually forward compatible with the 7T, and will charge it at max speed.\n\nOnePlus recently updated the 7 and 7 Pro to Android 10 in just 18 days, making it one of the first third-party manufacturers (after Xiaomi and Essential) to do so. With the OnePlus 7T, it's now the first OEM to ship a phone with Android 10 out of the box. OnePlus will update the device with two years of major updates, and three years of bi-monthly security updates.\n\nIf you're comparing the 7T to the phone it's replacing in the US, last year's OnePlus 6T, be ready for OnePlus' yearly price increase. The 6T was $549, so OnePlus' entry phone went up another $50. We're still expecting the announcement of the OnePlus 7T Pro in a few days, (which might not even come to the US), but for now, OnePlus' lineup is an odd duck. The $70 price tiering doesn't leave a ton of differentiation between the two models, and it seems like OnePlus could have stuck with a single model and it would not have mattered much. The OnePlus 7 Pro is the best Android device on the market, though, so the 7T being very similar to it can't be a bad thing. We loved the 7 Pro, so we should love this phone, too; there just isn't a huge difference between the two of them.\n\nT-Mobile is the exclusive carrier partner in the US (the unlocked version works on most carriers), and the phone ships October 18.", "description": "The 7T is a slightly cheaper version of the OnePlus 7 Pro.", "authors": ["Ron Amadeo"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/6-2-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
