After today, that button will see a little less use. Sony announced that it\u2019s ending Facebook integration on the PlayStation 4.\n\n\u201cStarting on October 7th, Facebook integration will no longer be supported on PS4,\u201d Ask PlayStation, Sony\u2019s official support handle, said on Twitter. \u201cThis includes Facebook\u2019s share features and friend finder features.\u201d\n\nIn a blog post detailing the changes, Sony explained that the PS4\u2019s share features will largely remain the same, \u201cexcept Facebook will no longer be offered as a destination to share screenshots, videos, music, trophy details, or links to gameplay broadcasts.\u201d\n\nUsers will no longer be able to link their Facebook account to their PSN account, which also means they won\u2019t be able to share friends lists between the platforms. Pictures imported from Facebook will also disappear. \u201cWe recommend selecting a new picture for PlayStation friends to identify you,\u201d said the company.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch still has Facebook integration.\n\nSony did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "The share button will still capture screen shots and video, but you're now more limited on where you can post them.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9ba81d2209bb000a6fe811/lede/1570482563464-playstation-4-pro1.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
