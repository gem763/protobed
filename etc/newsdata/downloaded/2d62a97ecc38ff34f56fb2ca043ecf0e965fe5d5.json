The conductor told Egyptian news website Masrawy that he 'did nothing wrong and they are the ones who jumped'\n\nPeople have called Mr Eid a 'ticket martyr' and the #Ticket_Martyr hashtag was used more than 24,000 times on Twitter yesterday.\n\nOne Twitter user wrote: 'We don't know that the new system says to pay to die.'\n\nMr Wazir said it was the result of an 'individual mistake' and will not happen again, in an interview with Egyptian TV station Sada Al Balad.\n\nHe ordered an investigation which will 'punish employees if found guilty' before revealing 'psychological courses' for train ticket conductors on 'how to treat the public well' are being organised.\n\nHis ministry will offer \u00a34,817 compensation to Me Eid's family and \u00a3963 to Mr Mohamed's.\n\nIn recent months, Egyptian rail authorities toughened measures including fines against ticketless passengers.\n\nThe Transport Wazir was appointed by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi after a train crash at Cairo's central station killed 22 people in February (pictured). He wanted to introduce tougher fines\n\nFrom April, individuals were given a LE20 or LE30 fine for riding 'VIP' French and Spanish trains. Those riding ticketless on non-air-conditioned trains would be forced to pay a LE10 fine and LE5 for Alexandria\u2019s Abu Qir Suburbs trains.\n\nMeanwhile the percentage of Egyptian's living in extreme poverty has risen to 27.8 per cent in 2015 to 32.5 last year, according to government statistics.\n\nMr Wazir was appointed by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi after Hashim Arafat resigned. This came just after a train crash at Cairo's central station which killed 22 people and left 47 people injured.", "description": "Mohamed Eid was killed and Ahmed Mohamed lost his leg after jumping from a moving No.934 train from Alexandria to Luxor, Egypt, when they were found without tickets.
