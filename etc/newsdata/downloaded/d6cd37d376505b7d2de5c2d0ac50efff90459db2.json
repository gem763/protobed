The timing means the ban will be in place in time for the UK snap election.\n\njack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) We\u2019ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons\u2026\ud83e\uddf5\n\nTwitter had previously implemented rules and restrictions for political advertising.\n\nThe announcement comes as Facebook is embroiled in a controversy over its decision to exempt ads by politicians from third-party fact-checking and from a policy that bans false statements from paid advertisements.\n\nFacebook employees 'strongly object' to policy allowing false claims in political ads Read more\n\nDorsey explained the motivations behind the change in a lengthy Twitter thread that appeared to include several references and responses to the convoluted arguments that Facebook has put forward in recent weeks.\n\nThe organic spread of political messages online \u201cshould not be compromised by money\u201d, he wrote. The advanced state of digital advertising technology, including \u201cmachine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting\u201d and deepfakes \u2013 fake or manipulated videos that appear real \u2013 combined with the pollution of the online information ecosystem with misinformation, \u201cpresent entirely new challenges to civic discourse\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about free expression,\u201d he added, in a seeming riposte to the Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent defense of online political advertising in a speech billed as a \u201cstand for voice and free expression\u201d. \u201cThis is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address.\u201d\n\nDorsey tweeted another counter-argument to Facebook with an accompanying winking emoji, writing: \u201cIt\u2019s not credible for us to say: \u2018We\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad\u2026well...they can say whatever they want!\u2019\u201d\n\njack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) For instance, it\u2018s not credible for us to say: \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad\u2026well...they can say whatever they want! \ud83d\ude09\u201d\n\nThat argument appears to mock Facebook\u2019s recent attempts to justify its decisions to exempt posts by politicians from its third-party fact-checking program, and to exempt ads by politicians and from a policy banning false or misleading statements in advertising. Together, the policies have created a situation in which Facebook is simultaneously asserting its commitment to reducing misinformation while allowing incumbent politicians and political candidates to lie in paid campaign ads.\n\nDorsey called for \u201cforward-looking political ad regulation\u201d, noting that transparency requirements that have been proposed by US lawmakers are \u201cprogress but not enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe internet provides entirely new capabilities, and regulators need to think past the present day to ensure a level playing field,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, called Twitter\u2019s decision \u201canother attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives\u201d.", "description": "Social network\u2019s move comes as Facebook faces controversy over ads that promote misinformation", "authors": ["Julia Carrie Wong"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1ce1d5dae7fcf44315d8a8432a1a3df4c966506/0_45_4671_2802/master/4671.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1b114a359221fc261a12fa2926102be4", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
