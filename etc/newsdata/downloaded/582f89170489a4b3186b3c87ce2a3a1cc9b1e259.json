The horned fairy returned to the Moors with Aurora to be its protector, and the young princess was crowned queen of the magical realm. Maleficent had opened her heart to the humans, and the two worlds were coexisting in harmony.\n\nWe should have learned, however, from the first film that we mustn\u2019t be fooled by appearances. While we know full well that Maleficent was the one who woke Aurora from her death sleep, the people across the land in their world know a different story, and there is still a divide between humankind and the magic folk.\n\nWhen Prince Philip (Harris Dickinson) proposes to Aurora (Elle Fanning) and she accepts, the two see their wedding as the perfect opportunity to bridge the divide between the two kingdoms. Maleficent (Angelina Jolie), whom we learned from the first film was brutally betrayed by a man she fell in love with, sees no good coming from their union.\n\nVideo of Official Trailer: Disney's Maleficent: Mistress of Evil - In Theaters October 18!\n\nNevertheless, against her better judgement, Maleficent agrees to attend a dinner in Prince Philip\u2019s castle in the kingdom of Ulstead to meet his parents. The king (Robert Lindsay) seems happy enough to meet the horned fairy, while his wife, Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer), acts very warmly to Aurora.\n\nThough Phillip and Aurora fall for her sweet gestures, we are shown early on that the queen has an ulterior motive for supporting the marriage. Meanwhile, tensions rise between the humans and the magical creatures, and Maleficent and Aurora soon find themselves at opposite ends of an impending war.\n\nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil has a promising opening that is reminiscent of the director Joachim Ronning\u2019s last film, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. The film jumps straight into the action, but from there, the pace slows down and drags a bit until the final battle, which much of the story leads up to.\n\nJolie and Fanning, I think we can agree, were made for their roles, and reprise them with the same amount of vigour as in the first film. Pfeiffer steps into the role of the ruthless Queen Ingrith, but we\u2019re disappointed that her character had very little else to offer to the story than to serve as the evil villain from the beginning, especially when the whole point of the first film was to show that people (or fairies) are so much more than just good or evil.\n\nThe creators of the film clearly set out for it to be a CGI spectacle. The Moors is, as always, nothing less than enchanting, and the final battle scene does have its moments. However, the film lost a lot of the heart it had in the first film and focused less on the complicated inner psyches of the characters. By the end of the film we hardly get to learn much about any of the new characters.\n\nMaleficent\u2019s loyal companion Diaval (Sam Ridley) and the three pixies that \u201clooked after\u201d for Aurora when she was little, kept the film light-hearted, but the overall mood of the film is darker than the first. This was perhaps expected, but if you\u2019re looking for more than a mildly epic battle scene and some impressive displays of CGI prowess, you won\u2019t find it in this Disney sequel.", "description": "Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning are as perfect in their roles as before, but despite its promising beginning, this follow-up is comparatively soulless.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/4cd5a654-f0c5-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires181818.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
