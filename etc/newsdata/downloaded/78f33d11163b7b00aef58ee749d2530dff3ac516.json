REUTERS/Ben Brewer/File Photo\n\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will exempt some agricultural products from additional tariffs on U.S. goods, China\u2019s official Xinhua News Agency said Friday, in the latest sign of easing Sino-U.S. tensions before a new rounds of talks aimed at curbing a bruising trade war.\n\nThe United States and China have both made conciliatory gestures, with China renewing purchases of U.S. farm goods and U.S. President Donald Trump delaying a tariff increase on certain Chinese goods.\n\nChina had imposed additional tariffs of 25% on U.S. agricultural products including soybeans and pork in July 2018. It raised tariffs on soybeans by a further 5% and on pork by a further 10% on Sept. 1.\n\n\u201cChina supports relevant enterprises buying certain amounts of soybeans, pork and other agricultural products from today in accordance with market principles and WTO rules,\u201d Xinhua said, adding that the Customs Tariff Commission of China\u2019s State Council would exclude additional tariffs on those items.\n\nChina has \u201cbroad prospects\u201d for importing high-quality U.S. agricultural goods, Xinhua reported, citing unnamed authorities.\n\n\u201cIt is hoped that the U.S. will be true to its words and fulfill its promise to create favorable conditions for cooperation in agricultural areas between the two countries,\u201d the report said.\n\nBefore the announcement of additional tariff exemptions, Chinese firms bought at least 10 boatloads of U.S. soybeans on Thursday, the country\u2019s most significant purchases since at least June.\n\nLower-level U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to meet next week in Washington before talks between senior trade negotiators in early October.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said on Thursday he preferred a comprehensive trade deal with China but did not rule out the possibility of an interim pact.", "description": "China will exempt some agricultural products from additional tariffs on U.S. goods, China's official Xinhua News Agency said Friday, in the latest sign of easing Sino-U.S. tensions before a new rounds of talks aimed at curbing a bruising trade war.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429382057&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0PH", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
