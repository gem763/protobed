It started as a workplace affair, but we fell madly in love and knew we wanted to be together forever, which meant leaving our spouses. She went first, informing her husband their marriage was over. But she did not tell him about our affair. They agreed to separate and all was amicable. When I confessed, I was able to end my marriage, but not without difficulty and revenge acts. Neither of my children has spoken to me since, despite my efforts to reconcile. Three years later, my partner and I are still together. It\u2019s mostly very good. My problem is that she retains a strong relationship with her ex. I understand this is good for co-parenting, but it makes me uncomfortable. She hasn\u2019t divorced him or made any effort to \u2013 even though I made a point of getting a divorce to ensure a clean start. In contrast, my ex-wife and I have never been able to have a polite conversation. She is spiteful, vengeful and constantly asks for money. I appreciate my actions have had consequences. However, I struggle to manage my jealousy and fear my partner will return to her husband. It feels as if she is keeping her options open. Am I being irrational?\n\nMariella replies Just a touch. You do seem to be ignoring the obvious, which is that your partner\u2019s approach is netting positive results while yours has created only adversity. She\u2019s engineered a departure low in acrimony while yours is marred by misery. I\u2019d put money on your being one of those impetuous lovers who doesn\u2019t like to let detail get in the way of an increased pulse rate. There\u2019s certainly romance in the notion that the right two hearts would forever beat in unison and previous commitments were merely training for this, the real thing. It\u2019s also a pretty naive stance to take.\n\nRushing from one relationship to the next, swearing undying love and tying yourself up in hard to untangle commitments is beset with obvious flaws. It may play to your sense of insecurity to believe that your new partner is hedging her bets, but a better way to regard it would be with a degree of admiration for her superior wisdom. She\u2019s managed to elegantly detach herself from her marriage without causing undue emotional misery and excess pain. Now she\u2019s embarked on this relationship with you, but without the same determined disregard for past experience. Instead, she would appear to be carrying with her the lessons from her first foray that include the possibility, hard-earned, that wanting a relationship to last forever and achieving that goal are two separate and sometimes unreconcilable ambitions.\n\nYour new partner seems less impetuous, mindful of the pitfalls\n\nFor many, their first wide-eyed love affair will struggle to last the elongated journey that our increased lifespans now provide. Sticking together for up to 80 years is a tall order and we could all do with lowering our expectations. The mistake you\u2019re making, and it\u2019s a common one, is to plough on without a moment to digest the experience you\u2019ve just emerged from \u2013 which makes you the proverbial old dog! Your partner, on the other hand, seems to be proceeding far less impetuously, at the revised pace of one set on her path but mindful of the pitfalls. That does say something about her expectation of your relationship \u2013 not least that it\u2019s imbued with the wisdom of past experience.\n\nTying another individual up in public statements of intent and transforming irrational impulses into set expectations doesn\u2019t make it any easier to keep them on board \u2013 as both your exes have discovered to their emotional cost. The fact that you see your current partner making a similar commitment as the only way to feel secure about your hold over her deserves further scrutiny on your part. It suggests that what you are in pursuit of this time around is no more achievable than it was last time.\n\nI\u2019ve no doubt your wife was furious you were breaking promises that she felt were non-negotiable. You\u2019ve proved her wrong by leaving her and now you want your next partner to make those same unrequited promises all over again. Think about it \u2013 it really doesn\u2019t make sense. Embarking on a relationship preoccupied with how swiftly you can create an inescapable institution doesn\u2019t bode well for the success of the enterprise.\n\nMany of us will move on from relationships that aren\u2019t perfect or have lost their allure over time, but life is supposed to be a learning process. I appreciate that the world today may not encourage belief in that concept \u2013 and your determination to declare your current pairing a \u201ctogether forever\u201d situation when you\u2019ve already broken that promise once is just another indication that as a species, we still have a lot to learn. I suggest you enjoy what you\u2019ve got \u2013 and when you are content enough not to care whether she commits publicly or not is the perfect moment to get remarried.\n\nIf you have a dilemma, send a brief email to mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk.
