According to the story, Barkley was drunk and that has not been denied.\n\nLampard\u2019s response was appropriate and measured.\n\nChelsea midfielder Ross Barkley recently made the news pages for an incident on a night out\n\nFrank Lampard impressed with his response to the incident which saw Barkley spill his chips\n\n\u2018Those are little things that shouldn\u2019t happen,\u2019 he said calmly. \u2018What he has done is be naive. I like Ross but he has admitted making a mistake. I will take that at face value and we move on.\u2019\n\nLampard made some mistakes off the field during his own career. They were more serious than Barkley\u2019s indiscretion, too. Maybe they have given him perspective.\n\nUndoubtedly he learned from them and now Barkley must do the same. The Chelsea player will soon be 26, which is not old but does put him at that stage of his career where he should be somewhere near his peak.\n\nBarkley is not at his peak, though. He is still playing catch-up after a couple of seasons at Everton that were lost to injury, uncertainty about his future and the fact that one manager in particular \u2014 Ronald Koeman \u2014 did not rate him.\n\nBarkley is still playing catch-up after a couple of seasons at Everton that were lost to injury\n\nSo, this season at Chelsea should be important to him. Too important to be wasted littering the streets of Merseyside on a weekend.\n\nLampard is right. Barkley\u2019s conduct that night was low on the sliding scale of footballers behaving badly. The police, for example, have no record of it. But it was abysmally timed and that is the point. In Lampard\u2019s team, in Gareth Southgate\u2019s England squad again, these should be days for Barkley to keep his head up on the pitch \u2014 he has always been good at that \u2014 and down off it.\n\nA look at Southgate\u2019s group hints at opportunity. No Dele Alli, no Jesse Lingard. Two attacking players who started England\u2019s World Cup semi-final last year are not there. It\u2019s an open goal for Barkley and he must not miss it.\n\nI have always championed him, even during his difficult days. Barkley has lovely vision and can play off both feet. He has football intelligence that you cannot teach but you have to be smart off the field, too. Traps are everywhere if you are dumb enough to fall into them.\n\nThere is an opportunity for Barkley to establish himself at both Chelsea and England right now\n\nLast week Lampard bemoaned the age of the smartphone, a time when the public are too happy to snap photos of footballers in the street, in restaurants and, yes, in the back of taxis.\n\nPrivacy, such as it was, is no more.\n\nCrucially, though, Lampard did not offer this as an excuse. He simply said the onus was even more on the players to behave and in saying that he gave a reminder of a coach at Manchester City who once spoke to me about the club\u2019s players constantly being snapped fighting at training.\n\nBarkley wasn't just being naive during the night out in Liverpool \u2014 he was really stupid\n\nI suggested the club build a bigger fence around the training ground to counter the lenses and he replied: \u2018Yeah, we could. Alternatively, the players could stop fighting\u2019.\n\nAnd there, in a nutshell, we have it. The world is watching and as such the responsibility on footballers grows.\n\nWith that in mind, I would say Barkley wasn\u2019t just naive. He was really stupid.\n\nTwo or three years ago, Sir Alex Ferguson sat with former colleagues and rivals after a League Managers Association meeting and spoke about the difficulties of bringing young players through from the academy.\n\n\u2018It is getting harder but do we have one in the United system,\u2019 Ferguson said. \u2018We have one and he is going to be special.\u2019 The boy in question was only 15 at the time and his name is Mason Greenwood.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer will hope his old manager\u2019s judgment is still as sound as it always was.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson praised Manchester United youngster Mason Greenwood a few years ago\n\nStruggling Kieran Tierney's cry for help\n\nEverton's Seamus Coleman invites young players from the club to dinner with himself and wife Rachel.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not great, young players training and then going to their apartments and being bored,\u2019 he once told this newspaper. \u2018It shouldn\u2019t happen, but it does.\u2019\n\nThis sprang to mind when new Arsenal left back Kieran Tierney spoke about problems settling in London. At Celtic, Tierney lived with his parents. Now he is on his own and has not even ventured into the centre of the capital yet.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not been great,\u2019 he said. \u2018I need to cook and I am still learning.\u2019\n\nTierney is 22 and not a boy. Some may say he should just grow up. I would say he sounds like a young man struggling and it may be a while before we see the best of him on the field.\n\nKieran Tierney admitted he has not even ventured into central London since joining Arsenal\n\nGood week\n\nDEAN HENDERSON\n\nSheffield United boss Chris Wilder was a little hard on his goalkeeper after his gaffe against Liverpool. Henderson had let Georginio Wijnaldum\u2019s shot trickle under him. But Wilder got the response he wanted from the 22-year-old this weekend. That bodes well for a young player with obvious talent.\n\nBad week\n\nHamza Choudhury\n\nThe Leicester player says he doesn\u2019t want a reputation for reckless challenges. He says he is learning. His foul on Mohamed Salah on Saturday suggests he needs to fast forward that process.", "description": "IAN LADYMAN: One of the most impressive moments of Frank Lampard's early days as Chelsea manager came when addressing Ross Barkley's problems with a Liverpool taxi driver.", "authors": ["Ian Ladyman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/19/19367550-0-image-a-12_1570386298127.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
