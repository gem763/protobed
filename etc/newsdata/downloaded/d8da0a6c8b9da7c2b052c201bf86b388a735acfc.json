This number relates to the project that are under execution,\" he said.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has previously set a target to more than double the share of gas in India's energy mix to 15% by 2030.\n\nIndia's biggest gas utility Gail Ltd has said it was close to completing the 2,660 km (1,660 miles) Urja Ganga pipeline project, connecting the eastern states of Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha. The pipeline will have capacity for 16 million standard cubic metres per day (mscmd) of gas.\n\n\"The Urja Ganga project ... will be ready by the end of 2020,\" Pradhan said on the conference sidelines.\n\nIndia's overall gas consumption is about 166 mscmd.\n\nThe minister said the government had started building the northeast gas grid to connect eight states in northeastern India, a region bordering Bhutan, Myanmar, Bangladesh and China. He said the grid would be ready by 2023.\n\nHe added that, before the end of government's current term, \"India will be connected by a pipeline ring that will help transport gas from any corner of India to a demand centre.\"\n\nMost of India's liquefied (LNG) import terminals are in the west, making it difficult for the industry in the east and elsewhere to secure regular gas supplies.", "description": "India investing $60 bln on gas grid to link up nation by 2024", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/general-use-news-image3_800x533_L_1412758447.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
