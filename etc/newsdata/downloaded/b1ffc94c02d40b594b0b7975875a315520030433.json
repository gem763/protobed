Eight new regional hubs will be created each with its own director of cricket to oversee coaching, talent identification and supervise the creation of a semi-professional regional structure which will see eight regional teams play 50-over and Twenty20 cricket. This will be in addition to the women\u2019s Hundred which runs alongside the men\u2019s competition from next year and will be worth an extra \u00a38m of funding. The regions and location of the hubs will be confirmed in December.\n\nIn Australia there are more than 100 women playing the game professionally and the gap between the two nations was evident this summer when England lost the Ashes.", "description": "An ambitious action plan to transform women\u2019s cricket that will include an extra 40 professional contracts has been launched by the England & Wales Cricket Board in an effort to close the gap with Australia.", "authors": ["Nick Hoult", "Cricket News Correspondent", "Michael Vaughan", "Simon Heffer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000170826782-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq2GeyommrMNVwqkZdyIaJgwiWPPJj3RTaXWF1UIDDREk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
