He\u2019s in the middle of a nationwide club tour, road-testing new songs from his imminent debut album, Neon Icon, and he\u2019s got more errands on his docket than time to handle them: clean the Porsche, locate a flash drive stocked with important instrumentals, find an available studio to record a new song, and get to a club on the Sunset Strip in time to guest-rap during a friend\u2019s concert. Somewhere in there, he\u2019s got a meeting to discuss the lawsuit he\u2019s threatening to file against the people behind Spring Breakers, the movie in which James Franco portrayed a cornrow-coiffed, tattoo-covered, abstraction-spewing white rapper\u2014a categorical infringement, Riff Raff asserts, on his likeness. He only flew into Los Angeles two days ago, and he flies out again early tomorrow. \u201cThis is supposed to be a day off,\u201d Riff Raff says, \u201cbut all I\u2019ve been doing is stressing out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful late-summer afternoon, but he\u2019s in too sour a mood to enjoy it. He took the Panamera to a car wash a couple hours ago, but the line was long and he got fed up with waiting. Much of his anxiety stems, no doubt, from his arrest three days earlier in North Carolina, where police searched the vehicle he was riding in after a concert and charged him with possession of a Schedule 1 narcotic, misdemeanor possession of marijuana and misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia. (The Schedule 1 narcotic, he says, was mushrooms.) He spent a few hours behind bars before they let him out; he\u2019s got a court date next month. His wrath extends far beyond North Carolina, though. \u201cI hate Los Angeles,\u201d he says, scowling as he crunches his cereal. \u201cI hate traffic. I hate people. I can\u2019t do the shit I have to do because it\u2019s so many fucking people in the way.\u201d\n\nThe 50 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time\n\nThis is jarring to hear, because in his music, Riff Raff is all about fun. The Houston-born MC has become an internet sensation\u2014a kind of human meme\u2014thanks to the engrossingly odd videos he posts to YouTube and Vine at a relentless pace, which have racked up millions of views, and thanks to his music, where nursery-rhyme melodies and ingeniously daffy couplets combine into a happy, hallucinatory brand of hedonism. His forearms are tattooed with the name of a hardscrabble Houston neighborhood, Acres Homes, but he has no pretension to toughness. \u201cWho\u2019s the most gangsta, mass-murderer rapper you could think of?\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d rather hang out with Will Ferrell.\u201d\n\nRiff Raff commands a broad cult following and his boosters include some of hip-hop\u2019s biggest names\u2014Drake, Wiz Khalifa, Snoop Dogg, Chief Keef. His finest punch-lines, heavy on pop-culture references and absurdist verve, play like Family Guy cutaways: \u201cI done shot dice with Larry Bird in Barcelona\u201d is a typically loopy brag. Detractors see his flamboyant style and dismiss him as a buffoonish caricature, but they miss the point. Rapping and singing over trap beats, dubstep grinds, and the occasional country lick, he has awesomely scant regard for the boundaries of genre, the constraints of rhythm, and the strictures of authenticity. One of his favorite tricks is to call himself The Rap Game ____, filling in the blank with a carousel of far-fetched identities: Patrick Ewing, Picasso, Sleepless in Seattle. On Vine, where he boasts a half-million followers, he inhabits different voices and characters, sometimes speaking through a puppet model of himself.\n\nToday, he\u2019s wearing Escher-like cornrows. He stands six-foot-two, tattoos cover his skin, and a thin beard zigzags across his jaw like a liar\u2019s polygraph. The fluorescent hues and patterns of his outfit owe a sizable debt to Saved by the Bell\u2019s opening credits, and his home d\u00e9cor continues that motif, with an added pan-Asian twist. Hanging above his unmade king bed is a decorative indigo arc nearly the size of a surfboard, festooned with red triangles, undulating strips of aluminum, and a yellow crescent\u2014a piece salvaged, it seems, from the set of some 1994 Nickelodeon quiz show. On a bedside table, a clear Lucite ribbon spirals upward from a Lucite pedestal; Riff Raff, momentarily mustering the improvisational charm of his songs, identifies this as \u201can ice sculpture from Wimbledon, in the Netherlands.\u201d Across the room are three samurai swords. Numerous crud-caked bongs sit on his carpet and kitchen counter, which is cluttered with hairbrushes, a rubber-banded wad of hundred-dollar bills and a purple sculpture depicting three galloping stallions.\n\n\u201cThis place is shit,\u201d Riff Raff says. \u201cIt\u2019s too small. My neighbors complain that I\u2019m too loud, then they ask me for pictures in the hallway. I gotta move. When I\u2019m in Los Angeles, I just stay inside and do drugs.\u201d\n\nFive years ago, Riff Raff was splitting the rent on a two-bedroom apartment in southwest Houston, dreaming of his big break. In 2009, he was cast on an MTV reality show called From G\u2019s to Gents, and he steadily built that exposure into rampant viral success and, last year, a deal with Diplo\u2019s revered Mad Decent label. In February, he was invited to attend the Grammys, he took a picture of himself sitting beside Vin Diesel. \u201cI first saw him on the reality show and thought he was just some character,\u201d Wiz Khalifa, who is slated to appear on Neon Icon, says. \u201cThen I started hearing his songs, and I fuck with him. He\u2019s got great lines.\u201d After chasing mainstream stardom for years, Riff Raff\u2019s finally arrived at its precipice.\n\nThe 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time\n\nBut to hear him tell it, the precipice isn\u2019t nearly enough. He\u2019s tired of people stopping him for autographs at the gas station. Tired of \u201cchubby girls\u201d giving him attitude after his shows. \u201cI might have another interview next spring and I\u2019ll have a house with a basketball court and somebody serving you lemonade, but right now I\u2019m in an apartment where I have to take the elevator with people,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle. I\u2019m famous, but I\u2019m not as rich as Brad Pitt. I\u2019m not flying to the game in a helicopter like Kobe. When I got pulled over in North Carolina, I was in an SUV. If I\u2019d sold out Tarheels Arena and I had a fucking helicopter, man, nobody could get near me. I\u2019d have federal agents pushing everybody back!\u201d\n\nBecause Riff Raff\u2019s manner is so outlandish, because he\u2019s murky on the subject of his background, and because his rhymes contain boundless flights of fancy, some onlookers have wondered if he\u2019s a put-on\u2014the question that\u2019s dogged him, from comment-sections to big-deal radio interviews, has been, Is Riff Raff for real? Spend some time with him, though, as he fantasizes about servants and helicopters and federal agents at his command, and a different question arises: Is Riff Raff living in his own private reality?\n\nThis is an expanded version of a story from the October 24th, 2013 issue of Rolling Stone.\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe first tattoo you notice when you meet Riff Raff is the large MTV logo on his neck. He got it during From G\u2019s the Gents audition process: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t even officially cast yet,\u201d says Cris Abrego, a co-creator of the show. He has plenty of other tattoos, many of them similarly aspirational: the BET logo, because he wants his videos in rotation on 106 and Park; the NBA logo, because of hoop dreams he nursed as a kid. Below his left shoulder, however, is a tattoo that testifies to the person he actually is, or more accurately, to the person he used to be: A large gothic cross, framed by a prayer, rendered in cursive, that reads, Dear Jesus, Please Let Me In. Your Child, Horst Simco.\n\nHorst is a German name, given to him by his parents Ronald and Anita Simco when he was born, in January of 1982. Riff Raff tells interviewers his name is Jody; he doesn\u2019t like discussing his background, perhaps because doing so would puncture his zany mystique. But a little digging yields some biographical facts. In 1989, USA Today ran an article about family travel alongside a photograph of Anita and her brood, taken at O\u2019Hare airport. The caption identifies the kids as \u201cViktor, 1, Amber, 9, Horst, 7, and Claire, 2.\u201d Anita grew up in Ohio, descended from a family of German and Lithuanian Jews that includes several survivors, and victims, of the Holocaust. Despite this and the Jesus tattoo, Riff Raff, asked if he\u2019s religious, says no.\n\nThe 100 Best Albums of the 2000s\n\nAt some point in Horst\u2019s childhood, his parents split, and Ronald, a onetime cop, moved to Minnesota. Horst\u2019s little brother, Viktor, grew up largely near Duluth, and is now a professional snowboarder. \u201cI met Viktor once,\u201d says Simon Rex, an actor and musician who befriended Riff Raff a couple years ago and has collaborated with him on hip-hop under the moniker Dirt Nasty. \u201cHe\u2019s like a mountain-climbing hippie, and he looks exactly the same as Riff, without the tattoos.\u201d\n\nRiff Raff says he\u2019s always been an attention-getter: \u201cI\u2019ve been super-fresh since elementary school. I\u2019d lay out all my clothes, my Jordans right there, I know what cologne I\u2019m gonna wear, my boxers match my socks.\u201d He wore Z. Cavariccis, Zumba pants, Girbauds. As a shooting-guard for his high school basketball team, he clashed with the coach over his flashiness. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like me; he didn\u2019t like that I was dribbling all around. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t need you to tell me what to do \u2014 you put me in the top spot, I\u2019ll lock it in.\u201d He says he began wearing his hair crazy around senior year \u2014 \u201cI\u2019d have a fade with a panther coming out, or stars and a moon, with some moon earrings.\u201d The same year, his grades slipping, he says, he dropped out, got his GED, and moved to Minnesota to stay with his father. From 2001 to 2003 he attended Hibbing Community College, in a town most famous as the place where Bob Dylan, another pop shape-shifter, left Robert Zimmerman behind. Riff Raff majored in liberal arts but stopped short of graduation. He describes his stint in Minnesota as \u201ca cold time.\u201d He didn\u2019t mesh with people there: \u201cI distanced myself from everybody.\u201d\n\nAfter a couple years he moved back to Houston, bouncing between rental apartments, taking odd jobs for cash: factory work, furniture-schlepping, \u201csome illegal activities I can\u2019t speak on.\u201d (He was arrested and convicted in Houston in July of 2002 on charges of petty theft, but otherwise his criminal record is clean.) He poured his earnings into purchases that reflected his baller fantasies, like a 1998 Infiniti J30 with a custom tangerine paintjob, or a gold necklace upon which \u201cRIFF RAFF\u201d unfurled in glittering letters around a Bart Simpson figurine. He installed black-lights and luminescent decorations in his bedroom, turning it into a makeshift nightclub nicknamed the Pool Palace, where he and his roommate tried to get girls to come hang out: Gatsby\u2019s West Egg dream pad, on a severely strapped budget.\n\nIn 2005, Riff Raff began recording rhymes over other rapper\u2019s beats, peddling homemade CDs at local malls like Sharpstown and Greenspoint. Humor was a part of his musical persona from the start, indebted to Houston stars like Devin the Dude and Paul Wall, and underground heroes like Big Tuck and A.D. Selling CDs, Riff Raff says, he needed no pitch beyond his extravagant appearance. \u201cI looked like something. Somebody\u2019s trying to sell you a Mercedes and he pulls up in a Civic with mustard stains on his shirt, dipping a pretzel in some cheese? Nobody wants to hear what you say unless you look like somebody.\u201d\n\nOG Ron C, a co-founder of Swishahouse, who briefly managed Riff Raff, recalls first noticing him some time around 2004: \u201cI\u2019d see him around the city at different events, just hanging out a car, rapping and freestyling. He looked more colorful than he looks now, loud beads hanging from his braids. He was the crazy white kid in the hood. It\u2019s not no joke. He\u2019s not putting on no act.\u201d Simon Rex agrees: \u201cWe were touring Texas together once, sharing a two-bed hotel room, and I was like, what\u2019s he gonna be like first thing in the morning? And from the moment he woke up, he jumped out of bed, dancing to no music, doing this crazy Riff Raff dance. I was like, Oh my god, this is him, this is genuine.\u201d\n\nThe Simco family seems supportive of Horst\u2019s transformation into Riff Raff. \u201cI met his mother and his younger sister at a show in February,\u201d Ron C says. \u201cThey were both there in the first row.\u201d Viktor has toured with him as a hype man. In a candid Simco Thanksgiving photo from 2007, Riff Raff is there, braids and all; the following year, he attended the wedding of his younger sister, Claire, wearing cornrows, a teal polo shirt and a black baseball cap, amid a sea of gowns and tuxes. Riff Raff\u2019s older sister, Amber, who holds a master\u2019s degree in National Security and Strategic Studies, maintains a family blog in which she refers to him as \u201cUncle Riffy\u201d and proudly links to his press clippings. This summer, she blogged that Horst has always been a ham: \u201cI thought all younger brothers were hysterical. But he never outgrew it, he just [got] bigger and sillier.\u201d She went on: \u201cEverybody keeps trying to figgur him out. Calm down\u2026He lives in the world like the entire place is his stage.\u201d\n\nWith Riff Raff, it\u2019s tough to separate blatant falsehoods from inspired inventions \u2014 and the latter are so compelling with him that it\u2019s hard to get riled up about the former. He fibs, for instance, about his age. Earlier this year he Instagrammed a photo captioned, \u201cRiFF RAFF 2005 AGE 19\u2033\u2014 even though he was 23 that year, and even though the guy next to him is wearing a shirt commemorating rapper Big H.A.W.K., who died in 2006. Riff Raff is slippery on the subject of provenance, too. In 2009 he told an interviewer, \u201cI\u2019m from Acres Homes.\u201d OG Ron C told me that Riff Raff \u201cstayed in Katy for a while, that\u2019s the suburbs, with his parents, but he got his swagger from Acres Homes.\u201d Property records from 2004 briefly place him in an apartment a few blocks west of Acres Homes, not within it. Last summer a Houston reporter named Peter Holley drove around Acres Homes for the Chronicle, trying to find residents who remembered Riff Raff. \u201cEverybody knows everybody there,\u201d Holley says. \u201cI went through a couple times and talked to people at liquor stores and basketball courts, and people were like, \u2018Oh, maybe I\u2019ve seen him,\u2019 but it wasn\u2019t, \u2018Definitely, he was here all the time, he grew up here.'\u201d\n\nInside \u2018Spring Breakers,\u2019 the Most Debauched Movie of the Year\n\nRonald Vaughns, an aspiring Houston rapper who performs as Freestyle Bully, lived with Riff Raff for several years on the city\u2019s southwest side, after Riff Raff returned from Minnesota. They sold CDs and went clubbing together. \u201cRiff used to only mess with black girls back then,\u201d Vaughns says. \u201cAfter he got on the TV show, white girls started.\u201d The roommates had applied to several reality shows, Vaughns says, including Making the Band. \u201cRiff always wanted to be on TV, to jump past the hurdles and groundwork you might have to put in as an independent artist,\u201d he says. Riff Raff wielded an indisputable marketing savvy: Before From G\u2019s to Gents aired, he posted freestyle videos online tagged with the show\u2019s title, so that people Googling it would find him. On the reality show, hosted by former Diddy manservant Fonzworth Bentley, a houseful of coarse-mannered goons competed to become proper gentlemen. (Riff Raff got voted off after two episodes.) Watching clips of him on the show, boisterous mugging shades occasionally into something resembling actual vulnerability. In one scene, Riff grew emotional, declaring, \u201cMy mama did drugs, you know what I\u2019m saying? I didn\u2019t have my dad or nothing.\u201d On another occasion, seemingly near tears, he told Bentley, \u201cYou here to help somebody who needs some help!\u201d\n\nAfter the episodes aired, Riff Raff grew accustomed to people recognizing him at malls, and the view count on his MySpace page shot up. But the buzz didn\u2019t translate to cash. The monthly rent on his apartment with Vaughns was $580, and Vaughns says he sometimes had to cover Riff Raff\u2019s share. \u201cThe Houston lane wasn\u2019t working as fast as we needed it to,\u201d says Ron C. \u201cHe was almost living out his car some times. I told him, stop trying to force it to people around here. They think you mocking them, they not taking you serious.\u201d The reality show, which had promised broader exposure, made Riff Raff\u2019s exuberant eccentricity seem like even more of a novelty. Today he refuses to speak about the show, calling it \u201cweak\u201d with venom in his voice.\n\nHe took to couch-surfing, pinballing among friends and relatives around the country. All the while, he uploaded videos of himself freestyling. In Los Angeles, Simon Rex and Andy Milonakis came across them, tracked down Riff Raff and eventually convinced him to move out west. \u201cHe stayed on my couch while he tried to find a place,\u201d Rex recalls. \u201cEvery time I came home, MTV Jams was blaring on the TV, and he was on the couch. His shit was everywhere. But you can\u2019t get mad at the guy. Any time I got mad, he\u2019d say something hilarious and defuse it. It was like a sitcom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are we talking about this past shit?\u201d Riff Raff says. \u201cYou\u2019re asking all these questions about old, negative shit I climbed out of, making me even more stressed.\u201d He\u2019s staring intensely at the corner of his bedroom, avoiding eye contact. \u201cYou ain\u2019t gonna know about me by talking about the past. Haters care about that. My fans, they care about where I\u2019m going.\u201d He becomes absorbed in his phone, and the conversation grows awkward. After a few minutes, he springs to his feet. \u201cCan you do me a favor? I\u2019m gonna get clean, get dressed. Can you get my car washed?\u201d He hands me the Panamera\u2019s matte-black fob. \u201cMake them clean the outside, quick vacuum inside, put the Armor All shit on the tires, and make sure they clean in between the rims. And I know how much money\u2019s in the console,\u201d he adds.\n\nIn the car, there is nothing in the console but a one-dollar bill and an empty condom wrapper. It\u2019s almost seven o\u2019clock. I visit five different car washes, but they\u2019ve all closed. After a while, I pick up Riff Raff and we head out to knock as many errands off his list as possible \u2014 he asks me to drive so he can catch up on text-messages.\n\nOur first stop is a restaurant in West Hollywood, where Milonakis has offered to introduce Riff Raff to a friend with purported legal expertise, to discuss the Spring Breakers lawsuit. \u201cI\u2019m gonna see if I have a case,\u201d Riff Raff tells me. In addition to the way James Franco\u2019s character dresses and speaks in the film, there are similarities in Spring Breakers between lines of dialogue and quotes that Riff Raff has given in the past. But both Franco and the film\u2019s director, Harmony Korine, have called Riff Raff simply one among several inspirations for Franco\u2019s character, and not a central inspiration at that. (Through their representatives, both Franco and Korine declined to speak for this story.) The restaurant where Milonakis and his friend are waiting is a tony, burnished-wood type of place, and assorted dining grayhairs lower their silverware and gawk as Riff Raff crosses the floor in a toxically green tank top and pink swim-shorts. Ordering a lobster entr\u00e9e, then quickly summoning the waiter to cancel it, Riff Raff asks Milonakis\u2019s friend, who turns out to be a high-stakes poker player, to estimate his chances of legal success.\n\nThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\n\nWhen Riff Raff has mentioned this lawsuit during interviews and on Twitter, it\u2019s seemed like a publicity stunt, much like when he appeared on One Life to Live earlier this year playing a shady art dealer named Jamie Franko \u2014 a brain-bending wink, devised by the people behind the soap, at Franco\u2019s own prankish turn on General Hospital. \u201cHe did some great ad-libbing,\u201d says Gary Donatelli, who directed Riff Raff\u2019s episode. \u201cWe don\u2019t normally ask people to improvise, but he was hilarious.\u201d \u201cIt was this meta-meta-meta joke,\u201d says Angelica Cob, a spokeswoman for the soap. \u201cWe knew casting Riff Raff would go viral, and it did.\u201d\n\nRiff Raff has neither filed suit yet nor retained a lawyer to do so, but while he asks that I keep the particulars of the dinner conversation off the record, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s genuinely angry about what he sees as pure theft, and that he genuinely desires legal recourse. Korine\u2019s and Franco\u2019s disavowals seem to sting most: If you devoted your entire life to the creation of an all-consuming, sui generis identity, how would you feel watching one of the planet\u2019s biggest movie stars crib from it, then deny doing so?\n\nAfter ten minutes of inconclusive ersatz-legalese, we leave. Milonakis has invited Riff Raff to pop up onstage at the Whiskey later on tonight, and he calls out, \u201cBe there at 11! Don\u2019t be late!\u201d It\u2019s about nine o\u2019clock now. Our next destination is the Mad Decent headquarters, across town in Atwater, where Riff Raff has managed to book studio time. As we head east, he plays songs from Neon Icon. Some feature trademark nonsequitur-riddled rhymes; on others he simply croons a single refrain over and over. The music is where he wants it to be, he says, but the sound isn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m about to spend $30,000 of my own money to get it mixed right,\u201d he says. \u201cI heard the label went to my homeboy and asked him to mix it. I\u2019m like, you\u2019re Diplo! Get Dr. Luke on my shit. Get whoever mixes Nicki Minaj to mix my shit.\u201d\n\nAt Mad Decent, Riff Raff dons a pair of headphones and an engineer named Derek cues up a beat built around four piercing notes. Riff Raff\u2019s friend and collaborator Lil Debbie sits in the corner, bopping her head. Riff Raff unfolds a piece of printer-paper scribbled with rhymes, amendments and cross-outs. He raps one or two lines at a time, then asks Derek to bring the beat back, picking up where he left off, rapping a line or so more, backtracking, and so on \u2014 an incredibly exacting way to make music that sounds so brazenly casual. There are some marvelous boasts \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m in east Texas giving Versace swimming lessons\u201d\u2014 but the dominant theme is privacy. \u201cGetting harassed at the airport! Damn I need a private plane,\u201d he raps, then warns: \u201cYou suckas is confused. Stop asking me all the damn questions less we doing a cover shoot.\u201d I get the faint sense I\u2019m hearing a diss track directed at me. \u201cSick,\u201d Derek says.\n\nRiff Raff grows more animated as he goes, swaying and swerving, throwing up his hands, tossing back his head. In eleven minutes and fifty-three seconds, he\u2019s got the hook, verse and ad-libs in the can. \u201cPlay that back, loud,\u201d he says. Derek drags his cursor back and lets the track bang. Riff Raff listens to himself rapping, and for what seems like the first time all day, he smiles.", "description": "Music, Film, TV and Political News Coverage", "authors": ["Jonah Weiner", "Jonah Weiner'S Most Recent Stories", "The Cosmic Healing Of Tame Impala", "Jenny Lewis Starts Over", "Billie Eilish S Teenage Truths", "View All"], "top_image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-12903-20131008-riff-raff-624x420-1381247794.jpg", "published_at": "2013-10-08"}
