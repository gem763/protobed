Only kick when the odds are in your favour. Get a kick marginally wrong and New Zealand will punish you.\n\nKick very long so an All Black has to turn to collect the ball. It is not easy, but this is what great teams can manipulate. Chase hard but in a controlled and organised fashion. They do have good back-three runners, but if they are under pressure running from deep in their own half even they will think twice about attacking.\n\nThese guys love to run and play very quickly from any subsequent rucks which we must try to nullify with intelligent kicking.\n\n2 Never give them bonus possession\n\nThis is fundamental and extends to all segments of the game.\n\nThe best way to play New Zealand is to ensure they have as little possession as possible.\n\nSo, firstly you pay full attention to securing your own ball at scrum, lineout and restarts. If in doubt at the lineout opt for the short, safe ball rather than a risky long ball.\n\nPossession is everything. And there is another aspect to this that all successful teams master. If New Zealand are pinned deep in their own 22 and they have a scrum do not give away a penalty, make them kick it out to regain possession.\n\nKeep that scrum legitimate, any scrum penalty just gives them an easy out. Ditto at lineouts.\n\nAttack the ball if you can safely but don't give a penalty away and lose field position.\n\nEngland need to protect and cherish the ball in the tackle in Saturday's semi-final\n\n3 Be on red alert if the ball is turned over\n\nEvery New Zealand team I have played against, coached against and watched is ignited by turnover ball \u2014 a dropped pass, knock forward, a steal at a ruck or maul.\n\nIt's like a jolt of electricity goes through them, they spark into action and start playing at extraordinary speed.\n\nSo protect and cherish the ball in the tackle and the first two or three men need to be there quicker than at any time of their lives.\n\nBe aware also that when New Zealand attack and go from breakdown to breakdown they don't always wait for their scrum-half to catch up.\n\nSometimes huge forwards like Brodie Retallick or Sam Whitelock get there first and move it on. Don't think you have got that extra second. You haven't.\n\n4 Concentrate on your own game\n\nDo not spend too much time analysing suspected New Zealand weaknesses.\n\nI've seen it mentioned that the two Kiwi wings are relatively inexperienced and we don't know how good they are under the high ball or turning to retrieve clever grubbers.\n\nIn my experience, New Zealand don't field wings with those weaknesses. We might not know that much about Sevu Reece and George Bridge but Steve Hansen has the choice of dozens of high-class wings down there so these two will be the cream of a pretty vintage crop.\n\nIf you do probe them too much with the wrong kicks and are just off the mark, that brings Beauden Barrett into play, sweeping up. And that's not a great idea!\n\nEngland need 15 players on the park, there is zero chance of winning if they get a red card\n\n5 Keep 15 players on the park\n\nYou have zero chance of beating New Zealand if you get a red card.\n\nEven 10 minutes down to 14 men with a yellow will result in at least one try, possibly two.\n\nNo team can afford to give New Zealand a 14-point start, so this is very important, and England have worked incredibly hard on it.\n\nFor me, England and Japan have been the best, fairest and most disciplined tacklers at the World Cup and have given referees no cause for concern.\n\nIt was also a seminal moment early on against Australia when Kyle Sinckler not only ignored a provocative pat on the head and a few choice words after one scrum but Maro Itoje \u2014 another fiery individual \u2014 stepped in and gently tugged him back. Keep that up.\n\n6 Never stop playing!\n\nThe match is never won against New Zealand.\n\nThey can score two tries in three minutes from nowhere, just as they did in their pool game against South Africa when they had been pinned down in their own 22 for much of the first quarter.\n\nIt's like that old cricket adage of adding two wickets to the score to get the real situation. If you find yourself 14 points up against New Zealand the score is effectively level. You have to keep going and accumulating points.\n\nTake every kickable penalty on offer, look for those drop goals I love so much. Keep ruthlessly building the score. England raced into a 15-0 lead against New Zealand last November but took the foot off the pedal and ended up losing 16-15. They are a much better team now and I hope they have learned that lesson.\n\nEngland raced in a 15-0 lead at Twickenham last November but then took the foot off the pedal\n\n7 Leave big guns on the pitch\n\nI have still not totally bought into the concept of 'starters and finishers' that England are using. I fully understand the importance of the bench at this level but playing against these guys in black in knockout rugby.\n\nI want my strongest team on the pitch in the last minute as well as the first.\n\nLook at the bench that may finish this game. Is it anywhere near as strong as the starting team? In 2003 even after extra time I had only put four out of seven replacements on the field.\n\nWe must keep our strongest team on for as long as possible and make changes based on injury and tactics \u2014 nothing else.\n\n8 Believe!\n\nEngland need to believe that they have just as many world-class players as New Zealand.\n\nMako Vunipola, Jamie George, Maro Itoje, Billy Vunipola, Tom Curry, Owen Farrell and Anthony Watson are world-class players in their pomp and I wouldn't swap them for anybody right now.\n\nEngland have the core of a World Cup-winning team and every player in the team can look at their opposite number and know they truly match up to them.\n\nAt this juncture I cannot resist my Will Greenwood quip. I was making this point on the eve of our 1999 World Cup game against New Zealand, that I wouldn't swap any of them for an All Black, when Will put his hand up and said: 'I think I am speaking on behalf of the team when I say we would in fact swap Austin Healey for Jonah Lomu!'", "description": "England face the All Blacks on Saturday as they bid to reach a fourth Rugby World Cup final.
