(Alice Martins/For The Washington Post)\n\nProtests ended in gunfire at a detention camp for internally displaced people in northeastern Syria on Monday, leaving four women injured, a medical aid group said.\n\nTens of thousands of Syrians, Iraqis and third-country nationals live in dire \u2014 and worsening \u2014 conditions at the al-Hol camp, which has recently seen an uptick in extremist behavior from its more hard-line residents, typically ardent supporters of the Islamic State.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said its team was providing routine medical care in an isolated part of the camp known as the Annex, where foreigners are held, when protests \u201cwere met with force from the security authorities that control the camp.\u201d The team took cover and treated four female patients, the group said in a statement, adding that its team was safe.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a clear picture on the total number of wounded,\u201d Robert Onus, Doctors Without Borders\u2019 Syria emergency manager, told The Washington Post in an email. \u201cWe treated four women in our clinic in the Annex until we could no longer continue working as the situation was unsafe.\u201d\n\nAl-Hol is operated and guarded by 400 U.S.-supported Kurdish troops.\n\n[At a sprawling tent camp in Syria, ISIS women impose a brutal rule]\n\nTwo members of another international nongovernmental organization said they had been forced to leave the camp early as a result of the flare-up in violence.\n\n\u201cIt was chaos. All we could hear were gunshots,\u201d said one, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to speak to the media. \u201cThe security situation felt so strained.\u201d\n\nEarlier Monday, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, the U.S.-backed Kurdish-dominated force that controls the area, said in a tweet, \u201cThe situation in al-Hawl camp is deteriorating sharply as Daesh militants have stepped up their regrouping efforts through women in the camp recently.\u201d Daesh is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be very \u00addangerous in future unless governments take responsibility for their citizens,\u201d Mustafa Bali \u00adadded.\n\n[ISIS leader Baghdadi urges followers to continue attacks, storm prisons in purported new recording]\n\nThe al-Hol camp holds almost 10,000 non-Syrians and non-Iraqis, Doctors Without Borders says, about a seventh of its population. The group has repeatedly pressed for the repatriation of foreign nationals, but many European countries refuse to take back nationals detained in the camp, fearing the risk that Islamic State followers may pose.\n\nIt remains unclear who was responsible for the women\u2019s injuries in the camp Monday.\n\nSince late 2018, about 70,000 people, mainly women and children, have arrived at al-Hol, fleeing violence in northeastern Syria during the dwindling days of the Islamic State\u2019s self-declared caliphate.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s events have already affected our presence in the camp as we were forced to close activities early to ensure the safety of our teams,\u201d said Onus, of Doctors Without Borders. \u201cNevertheless, we are still running our nutritional centre for severely malnourished children in the camp, as they require 24-hour supervision and care. We will evaluate the security situation tomorrow to decide whether we can restart our other activities or not.\u201d\n\nOnus added: \u201cWe are definitely concerned that today\u2019s violence might affect other organisations\u2019 willingness to work in the camp, further complicating access to humanitarian assistance for this vulnerable population.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe kidnapped Yazidi children who don\u2019t want to be rescued from ISIS\n\nToday's coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Doctors Without Borders said it treated four women for injuries in an area housing foreigners, mostly Islamic State followers.", "authors": ["Sarah Dadouch", "Correspondent Covering The Middle East", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MyKTZyty64GGxrhPpfbWKEGK_Rg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O73DHYGODYI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
