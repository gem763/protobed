Reefer Madness wasn\u2019t all wrong. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, fully 9 percent of people who consume marijuana develop a \u201ccannabis use disorder,\u201d even though the drug is widely understood not to be chemically addictive (at least not in the way nicotine, alcohol, or heroin leads to compulsive dependence).\n\nSimilarly, personal technologies are potentially addictive to some people, but like cannabis, not to everyone. By promoting the idea that technology is hijacking our brains and getting all of us addicted to our devices, techno-fearmongers promote the exception rather than the rule. They redirect the debate to the product instead of the underlying causes of addiction for the unfortunate few suffering from the pathology. The fact is, the vast majority of people are not and will never become addicted to their devices or their favorite social-media platforms just as almost no one gets addicted to alcohol from having a glass of wine with dinner or addicted to pot from toking up from time to time.\n\nClearly, the extreme use of pretty much anything can be harmful. However, for those who use marijuana or Facebook moderately, the negative effects are negligible. While headlines spread fears about addictive technology, the data show that almost nothing is happening. Earlier this year, Scientific American reported on a study of 350,000 adolescents that found that technology use had \u201ca nearly negligible effect on adolescent psychological well-being.\u201d The article added, \u201cEating potatoes is associated with nearly the same degree of effect and wearing glasses has a more negative impact on adolescent mental health.\u201d", "description": "By promoting the idea that technology is hijacking our brains and getting all of us addicted to our devices, techno-fearmongers elevate the exception rather than the rule.", "authors": ["Nir Eyal"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_572375079/facebook.jpg?1570652186", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
