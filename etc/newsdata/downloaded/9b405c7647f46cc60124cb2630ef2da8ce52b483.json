Pictured: A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 jet flies over Mesa, Arizona, March 2019\n\nIt is currently unknown what day the incident occurred on and where the plane was flying to.\n\nThe post was shared with USA TODAY by 51-year-old Mark Kaminski, a resident from Chicago, who said he got it from a friend of his.\n\nHe says both he and his friend are supporters of the president and that he was appalled by the flight attendant's behavior.\n\n'So this is how they treat passengers?' he wrote in a post on the airline's public Facebook page.\n\nHe then said the flight attendant was in the wrong for not 'giving his best to a customer because he hates the man's shirt and our president.'\n\n'My job is to do my job and go home,'' Kaminski told the newspaper. 'My job is not to be there and be ridiculing people, treating them like crap and having my opinion.'\n\nHe continued:''You can't just go out and lash out at people, just because that's the way you feel, at your job. Even as a human being you shouldn't do that. You should have a little bit of compassion.'\n\nKaminski tagged Southwest Airlines, and a representative replied with a pre-written social media response: 'We aim to provide outstanding service to all who travel with us and regret if we missed the mark. We appreciate you sharing your feedback.'\n\nComments soon flooded social media, with some praising the flight attendant and others calling for him to be fired.\n\nSome people even started commenting with the hashtag: #boycottSouthwest.\n\nSouthwest Airlines said the post was removed and that it has opened an investigation into the incident.\n\n'We aim to provide outstanding service to all who travel with us,'' spokesman Chris Mainzz said in a statement to The Hill.\n\n'The post in question does not reflect the inclusive environment we strive to provide for our customers and employees.'\n\nAccording to USA TODAY, the flight attendant removed his original Facebook post and has also changed his name on his account.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A Southwest Airlines flight attendant is being criticized after he posted a photo on Facebook that made fun of a male passenger that wrote a T-shirt supporting President Trump.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/20/19133550-0-image-a-2_1570218435219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
