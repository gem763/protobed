In only a few months, US prosecutors say the scheme consumed over $5 million in cloud computing power.\n\nCNET: Your VPN won't save you from these 3 things\n\nThe legitimate game developer's staff paid bills charged to their credit cards -- some reaching hundreds of thousands of dollars -- before the scheme was uncovered, but the main bulk of the charges remain unpaid.\n\n\"For a brief period, [Ho] was one of Amazon Web Services' (AWS) largest consumers of data usage by volume,\" prosecutors claim.\n\nThe DoJ also alleges that Ho created a fictitious game developer, \"Daniel Piers,\" who apparently was tied to a company recently acquired by the main developer that Ho was pretending to be.\n\nAs cryptocurrency was mined, the virtual coins Ho obtained were then transferred to wallets and exchanged for fiat currency on numerous exchanges.\n\nTechRepublic: 70% of businesses report Pass the Hash attacks directly impact operational costs\n\nThe unnamed game developer is not the only alleged victim. It is also claimed that Ho fraudulently used the identities of a Texas resident and Indian technology company founder to open accounts with AWS and Google Cloud.\n\nHo was taken into custody by the Singapore Police Force in September and is also being investigated locally. Under US law, he could face up to 20 years for wire fraud, 10 years for access device fraud, and two years for aggravated identity theft.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
