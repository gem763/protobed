A representative for the local NAACP chapter also told Yahoo Lifestyle last week that her family would be meeting with an attorney.\n\n\u201cThey put their hands on my back, they put their hand around my mouth, and they started to cut my hair,\u201d the girl told WJLA, adding that the boys had allegedly made disparaging comments about her dreadlocks.\n\nBut she has since recanted the allegations.\n\n\u201cWe can now confirm that the student who accused three of her classmates of assault has acknowledged that the allegations were false,\u201d reads a statement sent to Yahoo Lifestyle on behalf of Stephen Danish, the head of school at Immanuel. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful to the Fairfax County Police Department for their diligent work to investigate these allegations.\n\n\u201cWhile we are relieved to hear the truth and bring the events of the past few days to a close, we also feel tremendous pain for the victims and the hurt on both sides of this conflict. We recognize that we now enter what will be a long season of healing. This ordeal has revealed that we as a school family are not immune from the effects of deep racial wounds in our society. We view this incident as an opportunity to be part of a learning and healing process, and we will continue to support the students and families involved.\n\n\u201cWe will also continue teaching what we\u2019ve taught for more than 40 years: that the love of God is for all people, and as His children we should demonstrate that love equally to all people regardless of their background, what they believe or how they behave.\u201d\n\nThe statement also included an apology from the Allen family, who expressed remorse for \u201cbetraying\u201d the trust of those who supported them\n\n\u201cTo those young boys and their parents, we sincerely apologize for the pain and anxiety these allegations have caused,\u201d it reads. \u201cTo the administrators and families of Immanuel Christian School, we are sorry for the damage this incident has done to trust within the school family and the undue scorn it has brought to the school.\n\n\u201cTo the broader community, who rallied in such passionate support for our daughter, we apologize for betraying your trust.\n\n\u201cWe understand there will be consequences, and we\u2019re prepared to take responsibility for them. We know that it will take time to heal, and we hope and pray that the boys, their families, the school and the broader community will be able to forgive us in time.\u201d\n\nThe school, where second lady Karen Pence teaches art part-time, did not comment on whether or not Amari would face any formal punishment over the incident.\n\nThe Fairfax County NAACP chapter, meanwhile, has issued its own statement acknowledging the latest developments and asking for Amari\u2019s privacy to be respected.\n\n\u201cAmari is not a public figure,\u201d it reads. \u201cShe is a young girl who made a mistake, and we are asking everyone, supporters and critics alike, to please respect the family\u2019s privacy at this time.\u201d\n\nThe statement also urged the public to avoid using this instance to discount other \u201cracially motivated crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo often in these rare instances of fabricated hate crimes, critics use a broad brush to claim racially motivated crimes are virtually non-existent,\u201d it says. \u201cThis is demonstrably wrong. Data from numerous sources, including the Anti-Defamation League, the FBI and the Justice Department, shows bias motivated crimes are on the rise, year over year. The fact is that these type of fabrications are isolated incidents, but the public and media has a tendency to sensationalize falsifications over the thousands of real hate crimes reported every year.\u201d\n\nUpdate, 2:10 p.m.: This article has been updated to include the NAACP\u2019s response.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "\"We sincerely apologize for the pain and anxiety these allegations have caused,\" the girl's family said in a statement released by her school.", "authors": ["Erin Donnelly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VnQD3qrKXkvMxReJM2FCQA--~B/aD03Mzg7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/62dadec0-e3a9-11e9-a3bf-79a9555ad599", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
