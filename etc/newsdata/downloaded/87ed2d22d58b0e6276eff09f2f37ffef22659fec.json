SOCIAL MEDIA: The social media giants are stuck in a vise as both Democrats and the Trump campaign look for an edge by accusing the platforms of favoring the other side.\n\nOn one side are Democrats, who are demanding that Facebook and Twitter censor President Trump Donald John TrumpGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE and his campaign.\n\nThis week, Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala Devi HarrisPoll: Biden holds 24-point lead over Democratic field among black voters The Hill's Campaign Report: Warren, Sanders overtake Biden in third-quarter fundraising Yang calls out CNN, MSNBC for leaving him off of fundraising graphics MORE (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey demanding that Trump be suspended and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) ripped Facebook for refusing to fact check -- and remove -- Trump campaign ads it said are misleading.\n\nDemocrats are deeply worried that Trump will spend hundreds of millions of dollars and leverage his massive social media following to distort public perceptions, echoing concerns from 2016 when foreign agents used the platforms to promote misinformation.\n\nOn the other end are Trump and Republicans, who have long held that conservative voices are being suppressed by Silicon Valley liberals reacting to elite media outrage at the president and his supporters.\n\nUnderscoring the pressure on the social media giants -- this week, both Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSanders released from hospital after doctors say he had heart attack Saagar Enjeti claims media is protecting Biden Warren campaign fires senior official after allegations of 'inappropriate behavior' MORE (D-Mass.), a top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Donald Trump Jr. Donald (Don) John TrumpOcasio-Cortez says woman who suggested 'eating babies' was Trump supporter Ocasio-Cortez hits Trump after he calls her a 'wack job' Hillicon Valley: Barr targets Facebook's encryption plans | Social media platforms dragged into 2020 fight | EU court says Facebook can be ordered to remove content | FBI warns of 'high-impact' ransomware attacks MORE, a top surrogate for his father's reelection campaign -- renewed their calls for the government to dismantle the tech giants, albeit for very different reasons.\n\n\"The prevailing view from both sides now is that these companies have become so large and so important in political and social life that there needs to be some sort of government intervention,\" said Shannon McGregor, a professor of communications at the University of Utah. \"What that looks like could depend on the outcome of the election.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign's move to put $10 million behind ads alleging that former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE pushed for a Ukrainian prosecutor to be fired to protect his son Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company that was under investigation, was a tipping point for many Democrats.\n\nThe Obama administration has long said it wanted the prosecutor fired for not doing enough to root out corruption. There is no evidence that Biden acted to protect his son, although the appearance of a conflict of interest has become a drag on his campaign.\n\nDemocrats are furious over the ads, which are running across cable news and on Facebook, Google, YouTube, Spotify and Pandora.\n\nRead more here.\n\nPLEASE REMOVE: The European Union's highest court Thursday ruled that lower courts in Europe can order Facebook to remove user comments that have been declared illegal.\n\nThe ruling follows a case brought to an Austrian court by a former politician who demanded Facebook take down a post concerning her that the court said was harmful to her reputation and was public for any user to see.\n\n\"EU law does not preclude a host provider like Facebook from being ordered to remove identical and, in certain circumstances, equivalent comments previously declared to be illegal,\" the European Court of Justice said said in a statement.\n\n\"In addition, EU law does not preclude such an injunction from producing effects worldwide, within the framework of the relevant international law.\"\n\nThe court explained that host providers like Facebook are not liable for stored information if they are unaware of its illegal nature or if it swiftly removes it, but that that exemption does not prevent courts from ordering the host to take down or disable access to such posts.\n\nThe court's order also prohibits any requirement that a host monitor information it stores or actively seek out facts or circumstances \"indicating illegal activity.\"\n\nThe big picture: The enforcement of defamation, libel and privacy laws varies from country to country, underscoring the difficulty of creating universal standards in the EU. Critics warned before the court's decision that letting a single nation order a host to delete material could limit free speech and that implementing such a plan could require the use of automatic content filters.\n\nRead more here.\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT\n\nAmazon's most extreme delivery\n\nIn \"the land of high passes,\" the challenges are as vast as the landscape.

BUT FOR INSTAGRAM: Instagram on Thursday released Threads, a new stand-alone photo messaging app that builds on Instagram's \"close friends\" feature, BuzzFeed News reports.\n\nThe app reportedly functions in much the same way Snapchat does, without all of the fancy filters.\n\nWhen first opened, Threads is populated with everyone in the user's \"close friends\" list on Instagram, according to BuzzFeed. From there, the user can send pictures individually or to a larger group. If the recipient of the message isn't on the sender's \"close friends\" list or doesn't have Threads downloaded, then the message will be sent to the recipient's Instagram direct messages.\n\nOne reported feature that deviates from Instagram and is unique to Threads is that the user can set a status with an emoji to describe their current mood or activity. If a user doesn't want to constantly update what they're doing, then Threads' auto status can be turned on.\n\nUsing location information gathered by the user's phone, Threads can also show if you're on the road, at the gym or at a restaurant.\n\nRead more here.\n\nPSA: The FBI on Wednesday warned U.S. businesses and organizations of the increasing threat posed by ransomware cyberattacks, following several high-profile attacks on government offices and other public entities.\n\nThe agency said the attacks, which involve encrypting a computer before demanding money in return for unlocking it, are \"becoming more targeted, sophisticated, and costly.\"\n\n\"Since early 2018, the incidence of broad, indiscriminate ransomware campaigns has sharply declined, but the losses from ransomware attacks have increased significantly,\" the FBI wrote.\n\nThe agency has issued similar warnings of malicious actors trying to hack into websites seen as more \"secure\" and has warned of business email compromises, but this was the first in 2019 highlighting ransomware attacks.\n\nWednesday's warning follows attacks on more than 20 Texas small towns and other entities, and attacks on multiple school districts in Louisiana that led Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) to declare a statewide emergency.\n\nThe city governments of Baltimore and Atlanta have also been hit by ransomware attacks over the past year, with both cities refusing to pay the attackers and instead paying millions to recover from disruptions.\n\nThe FBI acknowledged the full scope of the ransomware attacks, writing that \"although state and local governments have been particularly visible targets for ransomware attacks, ransomware actors have also targeted health care organizations, industrial companies, and the transportation sector.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nHAND 'EM OVER: The House Judiciary Committee has requested Facebook files from a defunct startup that critics of the social media company say show it unfairly used its power to take out competing companies.\n\nThe committee is asking for all filings relating to the startup Six4Three's lawsuit against Facebook, including thousands of internal Facebook documents and emails, The Associated Press reported. The documents were previously sealed by a California judge.\n\nThe documents associated with Six4Three could bring new light to the debate about the social media mogul's competitive strategies and whether they are overreaching, according to the AP.\n\nCritics say the documents suggest that Facebook narrowed access to user data from certain apps that competed against the company.\n\nSeveral hundred pages of the documents have already been made public after British officials requested them from Six4Three Managing Director Ted Kramer.\n\nKramer claims that Facebook destroyed Six4Three's startup by limiting access to user data. The startup app called Pikinis found swimsuit photos from users' friends on Facebook, the AP reported.\n\nRead more here.\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT\n\nHow Amazon delivers products safer and faster\n\n5 things you don\u2019t know about safety in Amazon warehouses.
