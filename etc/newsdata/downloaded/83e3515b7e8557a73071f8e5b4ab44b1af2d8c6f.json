In addition to makeup, the models also wore vegetables. Several went out with thinly cut slivers of cucumber and radish placed across their forehead, cheeks, and chins. One received a trellis of cucumbers crawling up her neck, another a robust radish brow (stuck to the face using Grown Alchemist\u2019s Instant Smoothing Serum).\n\nBut are the cucumbers local? They are. The makeup look ties into the show\u2019s theme of sustainability. Showgoers were asked, \u201cWho are you in the farmers\u2019 market?\u201d and the backdrop featured imperfect and \u201cugly\u201d produce from Misfits Market, some of which the models carried as props.\n\nSome models even had gentle farmers\u2019 market tans \u2014 the light coloring you might get if you spend too long deliberating between Jonagold and Gala apples on Saturday morning. True to the brand\u2019s love of unexpected, exuberant coloring, some of them wore tiny clumps of neon lashes. And a few lucky models, like Ali Michael, were painted with \u201cnostril art.\u201d Makeup artists used three shades of eyeliner and traced around the holes to create a rainbow look that was on, in, and up the nose. Smith described it to Vogue.com as \u201cfresh, unexpected beauty.\u201d\n\nPhoto: WWD/Shutterstock", "description": "A description of the Collina Strada spring 2020 runway makeup beauty look, featuring cucumber face.", "authors": ["Kathleen Hou"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/09/09-collina-strada-cucmber.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
