The tech giant was forced to pull the plug on Tay less than 24 hours after its launch in America.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, within the first 24 hours of coming online, we became aware of a coordinated effort by some users to abuse Tay\u2019s commenting skills to have Tay respond in inappropriate ways,\u201d explained a Microsoft spokesperson at the time. \u201cAs a result, we have taken Tay offline and are making adjustments.\u201d\n\nWhen Smith was on vaction, he received a letter from a Beverly Hills law firm that said in part: We represent Taylor Swift, on whose behalf this is directed to you. ... the name \u2018Tay,\u2019 as I\u2019m sure you must know, is closely associated with our client.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer reportedly went on to argue that the use of the name Tay created a false and misleading association between the popular singer and the chatbot, and that it violated federal and state laws.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to Smith's book, the company decided not to fight Swift -- perhaps best for a singer rumored to hold grudges -- and quickly began discussing a new name for the chatbot.", "description": "Don't mess with Taylor Swift.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/Taylor-Swift_VMAs-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
