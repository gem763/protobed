So we\u2019ll monitor how he feels every day and be smart about the playing time.\u201d\n\nCano said he was 100 percent from an injury that had the potential to end his season. He returns with the Mets chasing an NL wild-card spot.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that I\u2019m surprised because I worked really hard,\u201d Cano said. \u201cI\u2019m just happy to be back right now.\u201d\n\nCano is hitting .252 with 10 home runs and 32 RBIs in his first season with the Mets after an offseason trade from Seattle. He was 2 for 7 with two RBIs during a two-game rehabilitation assignment with Class A Brooklyn before returning to the active roster.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The New York Mets have activated second baseman Robinson Cano from the injured list after he missed nearly a month with a torn left hamstring.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-assets.washtimes.com/images/favicon.30333d68dff6.ico"}
