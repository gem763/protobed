The industry is seeing its longest ever streak of sales decline.\n\n\u201cWe are preparing for best-case and worst-case scenarios ... worst case there will be more production and job cuts,\u201d said SIAM president Rajan Wadhera.\n\nCar and auto component makers have cut thousands of jobs and halted some production as the industry grapples with various challenges amid a broader economic slowdown.
