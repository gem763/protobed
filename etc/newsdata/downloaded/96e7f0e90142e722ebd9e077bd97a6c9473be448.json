Hardly!! I\u2019m an extremely open minded woman but this photo is lacking class,\" another person wrote on Instagram. \"Suzanne just doesn\u2019t look good anymore to flaunt herself in her old bday suit. Sorry Suzi but you\u2019re too old for this. Show some class (if you can find it) and put on a tshirt & jeans and then you will look hot.\"\n\n\u201cWhy...you are [too] old to be acting like this,\u201d one criticized.\n\nHowever, the naysayers of nudity were quickly put in their place by more supportive fans.\n\n\"She looks amazing and if you followed her on any social media you\u2019d know she\u2019s beautiful inside and out,\" one person snapped. \"Flaunt it if you\u2019ve got it! And she still has it big time!\"\n\n\"'Too old to be acting like this,' is what some people say,\" another wrote. \"Thankfully, she doesn't give a flying 'fig' what they think.\"\n\nOthers praised Somers for her confidence, adding that the posts may inspire others to embrace their own bodies.\n\n\"How about you! You are a role model to show people how to be confident and successful,\" one shared. Another added, \"You look amazing! Happy birthday and I hope you do this every year at any age as I know you\u2019ll always be beautiful.\"\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Suzanne Somers celebrated her 73rd birthday on Wednesday by sharing a photo on social media wearing nothing but her \"birthday suit.\"", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/W8_sLfaXsNGtGLachTZEqw--~B/aD0yNzM4O3c9MzUyMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/c03b5850-f052-11e9-b67d-6256218b84a1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
