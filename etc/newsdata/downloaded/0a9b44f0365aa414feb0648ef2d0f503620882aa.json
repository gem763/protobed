Another shows dead Kurdish fighters being cut with a knife as Arab combatants jeer.\n\nKurdish officials, along with the US special envoy for Syria , James Jeffrey, have condemned the videos, with the latter describing them as \u201cpotential war crimes\u201d while the Kurds insist they represent ethnic cleansing.\n\nUp to 170,000 Kurds have fled a battle zone along the Turkish border after a weeklong operation to push Kurds further into Syria.\n\nTurkey accused of using threats and deception to deport Syrian refugees Read more\n\nAnkara has openly stated that it aims to send up to a million Syrians, who are currently living in exile in Turkey, into the area it has since dubbed a safe zone. Where the newly displaced \u2013 most of whom are Kurds \u2013 will settle remains uncertain, as does whether the recent spate of ethnic violence can be contained.\n\n\u201cOne of our main challenges is to contain the emotional reaction,\u201d said a senior Kurdish official, Arshan Mizgen Ahmad. \u201cThose who killed here are not from this part of Syria. We are trying as an administration to calm them down.\n\n\u201cIt is not a blood dispute in the usual sense of the term. This has been a cultural move that has been prevailing for centuries. We are trying another approach. We have made great efforts not to see it as a blood dispute, but as a political manoeuver,\u201d she said.\n\nAnkara\u2019s proxies are comprised of Syrians who fought against the Assad regime, and other groups who have since been recruited as hired hands. They also include several extremist units, who were responsible for the execution of the Kurdish female politician, Hevrin Khalaf, who was hauled from her car two weeks ago and shot dead by a roadside along with her bodyguards.\n\nElizabeth Tsurkov, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute who has studied the Turkish proxies, said: \u201cThe factions fighting on Turkey\u2019s behalf are largely made up of young men displaced from their towns and villages from across Syria and particularly eastern Syria.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, it was clear to many Syrians that Turkey has altered its position regarding the Assad regime and will no longer attempt to topple it, and hence, those who joined this force after 2016 were often individuals willing to fight, in exchange for money, to advance Turkey\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\nUS to send 'mechanised forces' to Syrian oilfields Read more\n\nAnkara has denied sanctioning any atrocities in Syria amid reports it has used white phosphorus. Turkish military officials say they are investigating reports of executions.\n\n\u201cTurkey retains control over all strategic decision-making,\u201d said Tsurkov. \u201cIt decides when and where to start and end offensives. Turkey pays the salaries of these fighters, trains them in Turkey and in northern Aleppo, provides them free medical care when they are injured, and oversees all operations. Turkey is ultimately responsible for the conduct of these factions.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kurdish officials were struggling to make sense of Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he was sending US tanks to secure oil fields in Deir Azzour, in far eastern Syria. The surprise move came after his widely condemned decision to withdraw all US forces who were working alongside the Kurds on Turkey\u2019s border, ahead of the operation in early October.", "description": "Arab forces have allegedly been filmed torturing Kurdish fighters and mutilating bodies", "authors": ["Martin Chulov"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1f88da50e367f8778bdae7fe43e39782d7b4512/0_133_5343_3205/master/5343.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5667498855c07fe67e24171cc7d88356", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
