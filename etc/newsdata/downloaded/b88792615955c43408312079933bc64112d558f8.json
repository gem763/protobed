Jim Perry, a Republican from Lenoir County, was appointed to his seat only in January after Sen. Louis Pate resigned because of ill health, but the freshman senator has quickly taken on his party\u2019s most daunting challenge - trying to make the Republicans\u2019 irrational opposition to Medicaid expansion sound reasonable.\n\nPerry gets credit for making a new argument. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also the weakest. In a News & Observer op-ed last week, he said Medicaid expansion would be too much of a good thing. He said that\u2019s because \u201cadding hundreds of thousands of additional people to the Medicaid rolls will only further exacerbate the primary care shortage that already exists in the state.\u201d\n\nIn other words, for a half-million of North Carolina\u2019s newly insured working poor, there would be no room at the inn. Or rather, the doctor\u2019s office. The only reasonable course, presumably, is to leave those people uninsured while the Republicans continue to do nothing to ease the primary care shortage.\n\nFor support Perry tried some rhetorical jujutsu. He cited a researcher who has explained to the legislature why Medicaid expansion would greatly benefit North Carolina. Perry noted that Dr. Leighton Ku, a professor and director of the Center for Health Policy Research at The George Washington University, speculated in a 2011 article - three years before the Affordable Care Act took effect - that expanding Medicaid would \u201ccreate surging demand\u201d that \u201ccould affect access to care not only for newly eligible beneficiaries but also for others who depend on a state\u2019s existing supply of clinicians.\u201d\n\nBut now, with five years of data on what actually happened in expansion states, Ku says his worry did not materialize. He said last week, \u201cStudies repeatedly show that Medicaid expansion increased insurance coverage and improved access to care.\u201d\n\nPerry closes his piece by saying expansion\u2019s backers are misleading the public: \u201cIt is disingenuous to only focus on the positive aspects of expansion while ignoring the very real risks.\u201d\n\nThat would be true if there were \u201cvery real risks,\u201d but what are they? The 36 expansion states seem happy with their choice.\n\nPerry\u2019s argument follows a series of hollow Republican warnings about Medicaid expansion.\n\nFirst there was the rationale offered by then-Gov. Pat McCrory. He deemed North Carolina\u2019s Medicaid program \u201cbroken\u201d and said it would be irresponsible to add a half-million more people to the program. It turned out that the program is actually quite efficient compared to other states and has even come in under budget in recent years.\n\nNext came the claim that the state couldn\u2019t afford its 10 percent share of the cost of expansion. But under Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s budget proposal the state\u2019s share would be covered by the hospitals and health care plans that would benefit from the surge in insured patients.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the semi-conspiracy theory that the federal government might renege on its commitment to pay a minimum of 90 percent. Given that 36 states are now getting that level of payment, it\u2019s unlikely that their representatives in Congress would approve cutting it back.\n\nAs GOP lawmakers gird the state against a hypothetical Medicaid cutback, real money is flowing away. North Carolina has missed out on billions of federal Medicaid dollars that would have helped struggling rural hospitals, generated jobs and strengthened the state\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Republicans are out of excuses. It\u2019s time to expand Medicaid.\n\nOnline: https://www.charlotteobserver.com/ and https://www.newsobserver.com/\n\n___\n\nOct. 12\n\nThe Winston-Salem Journal on conflicts with an energy policy proposal by Gov. Roy Cooper:\n\nGov. Roy Cooper deserves the praise he\u2019s been getting for his enlightened energy policy.\n\nUnlike some other high-profile politicians in Washington and Raleigh, Cooper believes the threat from climate change is real, and he\u2019s trying to make North Carolina a leader in sensible clean-energy policy.\n\nToo bad his Department of Revenue doesn\u2019t seem to have gotten the memo.\n\nIn August, Cooper\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality released its draft Clean Energy Plan, spelling out how the state hopes to promote cleaner, alternative energy and help combat the threats from climate change. North Carolina has had plenty of first-hand experience with those threats recently: Just look at what happened across much of the state when Hurricane Florence struck last year, or at the catastrophic damage from Hurricane Dorian that Ocracoke Island is still struggling with.\n\nCooper is a strong supporter of alternative energy sources that can help reduce greenhouse gases, and in the last few years, solar and wind energy projects have flourished in the state.\n\nBut a policy of Cooper\u2019s Department of Revenue could have a chilling effect on that progress.\n\nFor about two decades, North Carolina used tax credits to encourage individuals and businesses to invest in renewable energy partnerships. Investors could get tax credits as high as 35 percent on money they invested in various clean energy projects. The credits had to be taken in five equal installments.\n\nThat particular program ended in 2016, but investors who had projects in progress could keep taking the credits until they had used them up. Some people involved in solar projects created partnerships not only with energy companies but also with banks, insurance companies and other institutions that essentially bought the tax credits.\n\nThen last fall, the Revenue Department said it wasn\u2019t going to allow the tax credits in some of those partnership deals that had been used to pay for solar energy projects.\n\nSuddenly, investors who been important in the development of the state\u2019s solar farms stood to lose as much as $500 million.\n\nCooper is known to be a strong supporter of alternative energy. That\u2019s good. But even as his Department of Environmental Quality is pushing an ambitious plan that will need the cooperation of business, industry and the state legislature, his Department of Revenue is taking a stance that\u2019s likely to scare away potential investors in future renewable energy projects.\n\nThe Revenue Department is relying on what critics call an extremely narrow interpretation of the law defining partnerships. The department said it follows the federal tax code, which doesn\u2019t allow the sort of \u201cpass through\u201d arrangement the solar farms had used to finance their projects.\n\nBut North Carolina\u2019s tax code can differ from the federal one when state laws differ from federal laws. By insisting on this narrow view, the Revenue Department is in effect making policy, a policy that\u2019s not that of the governor and that also seems to go against the intent of the General Assembly and a recent state Supreme Court ruling involving the IRS code.\n\nThe Revenue Department is also unfairly changing the rules on investors who acted in good faith, in a move that will make it tough for future clean-energy projects here to find financial backing.\n\nThe Revenue Department is a part of Cooper\u2019s administration just as surely as the Department of Environmental Quality is.\n\nCooper should do what it takes to get the Revenue Department on board with his ambitious clean energy proposals.\n\nOnline: https://www.journalnow.com/\n\n___\n\nOct. 11\n\nThe Henderson Times-News on efforts to halt the spread of e-cigarette use among young people in North Carolina:\n\nHenderson County should do everything possible to halt the spread of e-cigarette use that\u2019s endangering young people, The place to start is with parents and the community educating ourselves and kids about the dangers of products that were until recently seen as a \u201csafer\u201d alternative to smoking.\n\nThe Henderson County Board of Health is looking to get stricter policies in place to address what Board member Bill Lapsley described as an \u201curgent problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really freaking out that if we don\u2019t do something about this (quickly), we will be dealing with the next generation of substance abuse,\u201d said Lapsley, who also serves on the Henderson County Board of Commissioners. Commissioner Rebecca McCall also attended and expressed her concerns.\n\nState health officials say the best ways to combat the rising use of e-cigarettes, especially among younger populations, are 100% smoke-free policies, campaigns, price increases and cessation access.\n\nNearby counties including Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell and Watauga counties have 100 percent tobacco-free policies for government vehicles, government grounds, government-owned parks and recreation areas. Henderson County\u2019s current policy doesn\u2019t meet that standard because it allows for the county manager to make exceptions. Lapsley said he believes commissioners would vote to strengthen the policy.\n\nThat sounds like a good idea, but we should not kid ourselves to think it will be enough, as long as young people see vaping as a cool thing to do.\n\nReported cases of lung damage, illness and death have skyrocketed in recent months to more than 1,080 nationwide. That includes 42 cases and one death In North Carolina, according to Karen Caldwell, Regional Tobacco Control manager with the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Tobacco Prevention and Control Branch. \u2026\n\nTwo years ago, 37.4% of local ninth-graders reported having used e-cigarettes, and local high schoolers now use e-cigarettes more than all other tobacco products combined, Hope Rx Program Director Michelle Geiser reported. This is despite the fact Henderson County Public Schools already has a 100 percent ban on tobacco use, including vaping, for school properties and functions.\n\nMost middle school students try vaping in an attempt to fit in, test the waters and try to see what they can get away with, Flat Rock Middle School Principal Melanie Adams said. Those are the same reasons earlier generations tried and got hooked on smoking. With high levels of nicotine, E-cigarettes can be just as addictive.\n\nScary statistics, alarmist reactions and prohibitions won\u2019t be enough to stop young people from experimenting with vaping. Parents need to talk to their kids, and we all need to educate ourselves on the risks.\n\nIt took decades for our nation to fully address the dangers of smoking. For our kids\u2019 sake, we can\u2019t afford to make the same mistakes with vaping.\n\nOnline: https://www.blueridgenow.com/\n\n___\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Recent editorials from North Carolina newspapers:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
