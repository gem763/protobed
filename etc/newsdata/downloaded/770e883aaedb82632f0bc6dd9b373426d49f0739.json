Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on Tuesday. \u201cOnce the House impeaches, the House has impeached the president and then that hearing goes to the Senate. If they want to fail it, then I want to see every Republican go on the record and knowingly vote against impeachment of this president, knowing his corruption, having it on the record so that they can have that stain on their careers for the rest of their lives because this is outrageous to protect the amount of lawlessness and corruption coming out of this presidency.\n\n\u201cThis president will not last,\u201d added Ocasio-Cortez, \u201cwhether he\u2019s voted out next year or whether he serves another term, this president will not last, but those members in the Senate need to carry that legacy and they need to go to bat for what they\u2019re doing. The corruption of this president knows no bounds, and in order to protect our democracy we have to impeach him.\u201d\n\nTrump isn\u2019t accepting the possibility gracefully. \u201cTo me it\u2019s a dirty word, the word \u2018impeach,\u2019\u201d he said in May. \u201cA dirty, filthy, disgusting word.\u201d\n\nOne argument offered by some anti-impeachment Democrats is that there\u2019s little chance the Republican-controlled Senate would reach the two-thirds majority needed to remove Trump from office, enabling him to claim vindication as he runs for reelection. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s argument is the counterpoint: In addition to fulfilling the legislative branch\u2019s constitutional duty to provide a check on the executive, impeachment would saddle Republicans with a standard bearer whose approval rating has slipped below 40 percent in some polls.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., has proposed procedures for an impeachment inquiry, including a larger role for staffers in questioning witnesses, which the committee will vote on Thursday. Nadler made his intentions clear on Tuesday morning, although some confusion remains about where the process actually stands.\n\n\u201cWe are holding hearings \u2014 a series of hearings \u2014 to consider the possibility of reporting to the floor articles of impeachment,\u201d said Nadler. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. There\u2019s no ambiguity about it.\u201d\n\nAfter the report by special counsel Robert Mueller, it was widely believed the numerous instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president would be the focus of an impeachment inquiry. Democrats have also raised the possibility of investigating allegations of insurance fraud, dubious tax schemes and money laundering by Trump\u2019s businesses. But some legislators have come to the view that Trump\u2019s use of the presidency to promote his own businesses \u2014 and have taxpayers pick up the tab for officials who stay at his hotels \u2014 would be the easiest case to make to voters, and the clearest violation of the Constitution.\n\nTrump has denied directing government business to his properties.\n\n\u201cPeople understand what it means for the president to be spending millions of dollars in federal government tax dollars at his own business properties,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a Judiciary Committee member who supports impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe Mueller report has clearly been muddled, and I\u2019m not sure that the public really has much of a concept of what that showed,\u201d said Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky. \u201cAnd corruption is pretty easy to understand.\u201d\n\nRoughly 134 Democrats, over half the caucus, have come out in favor of beginning impeachment proceedings. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet endorsed the idea, even as committee chairs like Nadler and other members of leadership begin to throw their support behind it.\n\nBeginning an inquiry would not necessarily lead to impeachment, which is analogous to a criminal indictment and, if approved by the House, would lead to a trial in the Senate. The House would first investigate whether there was sufficient evidence that the president had met the standard in the Constitution of \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nIf an impeachment resolution is brought to the floor the full House, Democrats and Republicans, would vote on articles of impeachment. If they approve one or more of them by a simple majority, the president would officially be impeached, but not removed from office.", "description": "With Congress returning to work after the August recess, some House Democrats are renewing their call to begin impeachment proceedings \u2014 even if just to get Republicans on the record voting in support of President Trump.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9HurpnHG2yX3wF5.pLbLyg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/a74b5400-d3f9-11e9-a3f7-84f6c25e61ea", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
