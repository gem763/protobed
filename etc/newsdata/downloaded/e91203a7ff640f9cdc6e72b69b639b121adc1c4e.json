And as bizarre as this may sound to someone who isn\u2019t well-versed with Indian traditions, what\u2019s equally strange is a bunch of women from a UP village believing that fasting for their husbands will kill them.\n\nYes, it does happen only in India.\n\nAccording to reports, women from Vijau Village in Surir town of Uttar Pradesh resist fasting on Karwa Chauth because they believe it will endanger the lives of their husbands. This belief stems from a 200-year-old story about a newly-married Brahmin man and woman, some stolen bulls, and a deadly curse. Sounds like the plot of a bad Indian TV show, right? Wait till you hear the rest.\n\nIndia TV reported a local resident, Kishori Lal Chaturvedi, saying this: \u201cSince the past 200 years, this village has been under a curse and anyone who observes a fast on Karva Chauth, loses her husband. The curse was given by a Brahmin woman, whose husband was beaten to death by villagers here on Karwa Chauth.\u201d According to NewsJizz (no, really, that\u2019s the name), the woman committed suicide by jumping onto her husband\u2019s funeral pyre. But she did make sure she cursed the villagers before she did. In other reports, the villagers claim the Brahmin man was beaten to death because he was accused of stealing a villager\u2019s bulls -- and you thought we\u2019re more intolerant now.\n\nStrengthening belief in the curse were some stray cases of male deaths that coincidentally occurred when women decided to defy tradition and fast on Karwa Chauth. So terrified are women in the village of causing their husbands\u2019 deaths, that they don\u2019t buy any wedding-related paraphernalia from the local village vendors. National Herald reported that the women in Vijau don\u2019t even buy sindoor from the village. They use sindoor brought from their own respective villages to signify that they\u2019re married -- you know, wrath of the scorned (and dead) Brahmin woman and all.\n\nInstead of fasting for the long lives of their husbands, the women of Vijau pray at a \u201cSati\u201d temple instead, Sati being the largely historical practise of a woman sacrificing her life by sitting atop her husband\u2019s funeral pyre. If you\u2019re not finding this entire piece of news ironic (the practice of one historical tradition to avoid another), we\u2019re not sure you get irony at all.", "description": "Women from Vijau village in Mathura do not fast on Karwa Chauth because, according to a local tale, it will endanger the lives of their husbands", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://im.idiva.com/content/2019/Oct/iDiva_No-Karwa-Chauth-Fast-For-Women-In-This-UP-Village-Cause-It-Kills-Husbands_Social_5da83736920d5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
