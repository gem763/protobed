Investors never even have to see the property. To build trust with remote buyers, the company provides a 30-day money back guarantee, said Beasley.\n\nSome 93% of Roofstock\u2019s customers buy from out-of-state, with most buyers coming from expensive coastal markets. The popular markets where customers buy are lower-priced with an established rental market, he said, with top markets including Atlanta, Indianapolis, Birmingham, Houston and San Antonio.\n\n\u201cYou could actually get on the investment bandwagon in other parts of the country where you could actually afford to buy,\u201d said Beasley. \u201cPeople looking for more flexibility and optionality in their investment strategy and where they live.\u201d\n\nBeasley said that its typical buyers finance 70% of the purchase through government-subsidized loans through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \u201cYou can build a nice portfolio using that government-backed financing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite attractive.\u201d\n\nRoofstock has closed $2 billion worth of transactions since it was founded less than four years ago.\n\nSarah Paynter is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
