Australian investors pay around $1 billion each year for registry services.\n\nA document prepared for the new group says its members have \"evidence-based concerns that the replacement project\u2019s primary beneficiary is the ASX, rather than the issuers, investors and participants the project is purported to benefit\".\n\nThe founding members are three registry companies (Computershare, Link Group and BoardRoom), three industry groups (Australian Investor Relations Association, Governance Institute of Australia, and SAFAA) and consumer group the Australian Shareholders Association (ASA).\n\nMr Stevens told The Australian Financial Review's Chanticleer column that the ASX has consulted widely with relevant stakeholders and that the new system could help to reduce the $23 billion it costs to run the superannuation system each year.\n\nHe said there are no structural impediments to competition in the settlement and clearing space, and predicted a challenger could emerge.\n\nBut members of the new lobby group say the project could entrench the ASX's market power and that the prospects of a competitive market are diminished unless potential competitors gain access to more information.\n\nFiona Balzer, policy manager at the ASA and a former infrastructure sector analyst at Westpac, said Australia\u2019s equity settlement and clearing system is effectively a piece of critical national infrastructure and should be subject to the same conditions and regulatory settings as other big infrastructure projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou need a third-party access regime and you need the competition authority\u2019s oversight,\u201d she said. \u201cThe power of a regulated company which trades on the market it manages itself is just a whole bunch of conflicts stuck in one place.\u201d\n\nThe stakeholder group is calling on the federal government to mandate that the ASX provide access to its intellectual property to third parties, such as fintech start-ups, which could potentially help develop rival offerings.\n\n\u201cA third-party access regime would actually facilitate the ability for disrupters to take a look at this technology and actually be able to innovate,\u201d Ms Balzer said.\n\nShe suggested there is no shortage of \"financial minds\" in Australia who can benefit from participation in an access regime and come up with competitive solutions, including existing share registry providers.\n\n'Creative destruction'\n\nJudith Fox, chief executive of the SAFAA, said her organisation supports the overall move to a more technologically advanced settlement and clearing system, but is fearful about the ASX\u2019s conflicted role in operating it.\n\n\u201cWe are not anti-innovation. I know it\u2019s easy to portray us as luddites, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on here,\u201d Ms Fox said. \u201cThe idea of a distributed ledger technology platform is a really sound one and we support that and we support innovation.\n\n\"The concern is primarily around competition because ASX is a publicly listed, for-profit company, and is positioning itself to effectively monopolise what will be a valuable piece of national infrastructure.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only founding member of the stakeholder group solely representing the interests of investors \u2013 the ASA \u2013 is not motivated by the survival of share registries, but it does believe they play an important role in holding the ASX to account.\n\n\u201cWe would be concerned about these organisations being disrupted and taken out of the market if it wasn\u2019t a contested market,\u201d said Ms Balzer.\n\n\u201cBeing disrupted and then replaced by something equally strong and competitive is different than being taken out and replaced by the ASX.\u201d\n\nMs Balzer said the share registries had lifted their game in recent years through investing in online portals, following criticism from retail investors.\n\nComputershare reported total revenue in the last financial year of $2.4 billion, with 10 per cent of this earned in Australia. Link, meanwhile, reported $1.4 billion in revenue, with $700 million made in Australia.\n\nThe three share registry founding members declined to comment, instead referring The Australian Financial Review to fellow members, the Governance Institute and AIRA.\n\nComputershare said in its recent annual report that the \u201cultimate market structure implications [from blockchain] are not yet known\u201d.\n\nYet it said it is adopting a \u201cmeasured and considered approach\u201d to the technology, including \u201cpursing a dual-track approach in terms of assessing the commercial value of introducing innovative blockchain services in market adjacencies, while also rigorously defending our existing role and overall market positioning''.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMs Fox agreed that the share registries could potentially be disrupted, but rejected suggestions that their motivation in criticising the CHESS replacement project stems from self-interest entirely.\n\n\u201cCapitalism is creative destruction, businesses rise and fall \u2013 that\u2019s not the issue,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, the share registries might be thinking about their self-interest, but there is also that concern about competition. At the heart of the concern is the conflict of interest whereby the ASX is project manager, the future operator and a for-profit entity.\u201d\n\nSPPs and privacy\n\nASA had had \"a lot of meetings\" with ASX about the project, \"but we still can\u2019t get much detail out of [ASX],\" Ms Balzer said. \"They have very charming people and they give us lots of information, but they don\u2019t answer any specifics around the complexity.\u201d\n\nThe ASA is concerned that an unintended consequence of the CHESS replacement could be that retail investors get muscled out of the market for share purchase plans and other capital raising opportunities.\n\n\u201cThere is talk of the ASX putting all the potential take-up [for] an SPP [share purchase plan] on to the system, and even if it was one cent for each potential take-up, it could make companies think twice about offering up SPPs to all shareholders,\u201d Ms Balzer said.\n\nThey have very charming people and they give us lots of information, but they don\u2019t answer any specifics around the complexity. \u2014 Fiona Balzer, ASA\n\n\u201cThat might mean that shareholders who rely on those sorts of capital offers to not be diluted by the big end of town will not be offered those sorts of catch-ups in the future.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe common practice in the market is that brokers will only register investors who are actively participating in the offer in CHESS, Ms Balzer said, meaning that the administrative costs for issuers are reduced.\n\nThe fear around prospective investors being registered in CHESS without actively participating in an offer also raises privacy risks, she said.\n\nUnder the incumbent system, brokers often do not enter bank account and other private information into CHESS because there is no requirement to do so and there are costs associated with updating data.\n\n\u201cSometimes that can be annoying but retail shareholders own that data and should decide who can get access to that data,\u201d Ms Balzer said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want data accessed willy-nilly.\u201d\n\nA working paper compiled by Deloitte on behalf of the stakeholder group raises a number of other privacy and data concerns.\n\n\u201cThe replacement project will drive functional changes resulting in an expansion in the scope of consumer data shared,\u201d the working paper said.\n\n\u201cIt will also change how/where data is stored, and who will have access to it. This raises not only privacy concerns, but also questions as to the purpose of a market operator moving into a data holder role.\u201d\n\nThe ASX disputes such concerns about data. Mr Stevens said the ASX had no intention of taking more data or charging investors \u201cany more money\u201d, but instead was focused on building a technology system for the next 20 or 30 years.", "description": "The ASX's new settlement and clearing system should be classified as critical national infrastructure and opened up to fintech challengers, say stakeholders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2606%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/eddd32df1694a4ed964f782906ff08faeeeccd86", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
