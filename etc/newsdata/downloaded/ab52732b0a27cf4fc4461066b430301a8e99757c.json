William McRaven, who became famous for urging University of Texas graduates to get up early and make their beds during a commencement address, called Trump a threat to the Republic and urged that he be removed from office.\n\nRetired general and former Secretary of Defense James Mattis James Norman MattisJohn Feehery: Mutiny on the Bounty Amash rips Trump over move to send troops from Syria to Iraq Defense chief says US troops leaving Syria will go to western Iraq MORE was more subtle in his condemnation of the current occupant of the White House, \u201cI earned my spurs on the battlefield ... Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor.\u201d\n\nThe military is by far the most respected institution in America, perhaps the only respected institution left. And that gives former members of our armed forces a big platform from which they can spout their views.\n\nBecause this is America, and because we have a Constitution, they have the right to say whatever they want, especially now that they are outside the chain of command.\n\nBut it is not the military or former members of the military who should be deciding these things or indeed who should be opining on them.\n\nCalling for the removal of the president because you disagree with his policy decisions in places like Syria is not wise and yes, more than a little bit dangerous.\n\nI may not like everything that this president says or does, but I do respect that he won the White House, fair and square, and that he campaigned on many of the same things that he is attempting to do today.\n\nHe wants to pull our troops out of places like Afghanistan and Syria. This is no secret. He has long made it known that he is not happy with our troops fighting endless wars in faraway places with no exit plan and no possibility for a total victory.\n\nI don\u2019t think the president\u2019s views are uniquely held by him. Sure, pulling out of Kurdish-held Syria precipitously was perhaps not the greatest look for the Trump administration or for America in general, but since when is it our job to mediate a centuries-long beef between the Kurds and the Turks, especially since we have an actual signed alliance with Turkey?\n\nMcRaven also doesn\u2019t like the content of the president\u2019s character, nor his language, nor his decisionmaking process, nor his obvious lack of historic knowledge and he has made clear those concerns in a series of columns.\n\nBut once again, none of this is a secret. It was well-played out during an exhaustive Republican primary and during a heated general election.\n\nTrump is not some sort of Manchurian candidate who dramatically changed once he got into office. I daresay he hasn\u2019t changed all that much in his approach or in his promises.\n\nCalling for the president to be deposed sooner rather than later is ill-considered and anti-democratic. In America, we have elections if we don\u2019t like what our leaders are doing.\n\nMcRaven might be a great guy and he might have a sterling record, but if he doesn\u2019t like Trump, he should throw his hat in the ring and run.\n\nHis comments are like Mutiny on the Bounty, except without the exotic Polynesian women.", "description": "Donald Trump is a combination of Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney and Charles Laughton.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_100819getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
