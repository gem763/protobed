But she said she has asked acting SSA Director-General Loyiso Jafta to look into the matter, \"to determine what needs to be done\".\n\nREAD | Top spy Thulani Dlomo still AWOL eight months after being recalled to the SSA\n\nDlodlo said she could not discuss the details of Dlomo\u2019s circumstances as this would be unlawful in terms of labour law.\n\nThe minister said that she had not personally seen Dlomo at work, but pointed out that he did not report to her, so this might not be significant. As Dlomo reports to Jafta, Dlodlo said the director-general would be best placed to update her on the issue.\n\nDlodlo said that she would then be in a position to determine whether action should be taken against Dlomo in terms of the Labour Relations Act and the SSA\u2019s own internal policies.\n\nShe said that public servants typically were considered AWOL if they had not been at work for 30 days, but the rules were stricter for SSA employees, who are not employed in terms of the Public Service Act like other government employees. Dlodlo said Dlomo\u2019s seniority would also be a factor in terms of how long he can miss work before being considered \"AWOL\", if this was found to be the case.\n\nNews24 reported on Wednesday that Dlomo had not been to the SSA\u2019s headquarters in Pretoria, known as \"The Farm\", since his return from Japan. This is according to an impeccable source in the intelligence community.\n\nVrye Weekblad also reported in April that Dlomo had all but disappeared.\n\nDlomo\u2019s appointment to the SSA in 2017 by former president Jacob Zuma was controversial, because he was allegedly implicated in a tender scandal while employed by the KwaZulu-Natal government.\n\nThe SO unit he had headed before his Japan posting received searing criticism from the High Level Panel on the State Security Agency, which released a report earlier this year into failings at the intelligence agency.\n\nThe report referred to the unit as a \"law unto itself and directly served the political interests of the executive\".\n\nThe panel named a number of \"illegal\" activities undertaken by the unit under Dlomo's watch. It said that the SO became a \"parallel intelligence structure serving a faction of the ruling party and, in particular, the personal political interests of the sitting president of the party and the country. This is in direct breach of the Constitution, the White Paper, the relevant legislation and plain good government intelligence functioning\".\n\nThe panel further recommended: \"The findings of the panel and of the current investigation of the (inspector general) and the SO and related matters should form the basis for serious consequences and for those involved in illegal activity, including, where appropriate, disciplinary and/or criminal prosecution.\"", "description": "Intelligence Minister Ayanda Dlodlo has tasked her most senior official to investigate the whereabouts of top spy, Thulani Dlomo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9131/d493dc2558694c859fdd15526b852c2f.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
