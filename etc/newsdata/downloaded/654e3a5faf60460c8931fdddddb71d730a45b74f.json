You just can't disappear without a trace,' Ms Bowen told Nine News.\n\nThe Adelaide grandmother was overseas with her husband Frank visiting her dying 101-year-old mother.\n\nThe Adelaide grandmother was abroad with her husband Frank (pictured together) visiting her 101-year-old mother who was extremely ill\n\nShe went to the dentist - something she typically did while in Malayisa - before getting in an Uber to visit her mother.\n\nMs Bowen said her mother is believed to have asked the Uber driver to pull over halfway through the trip and she got out of the car outside an orphanage in Penang.\n\n'And that's it, that's all we know,' she said.\n\nThat is the last time Mrs Jenkins was seen.\n\nHer family has repeatedly travelled to Malaysia, printed 12,000 posters and hired a private security team in a bid to find her.\n\nThe family were given hope last year after they spotted a woman who looked strikingly similar to Mrs Jenkins.\n\nJen Bowen (pictured) has hopes that her mother is OK despite being missing for two years\n\nThe woman looked so alike to Mrs Jenkins that from a distance even Ms Bowen thought the search was over.\n\nEarlier this year Ms Bowen said there had been 20 reported sightings of Mrs Jenkins - all of which Malaysian authorities had been given to investigate.\n\n'We're in Australia. We feel so much more helpless being over here.
