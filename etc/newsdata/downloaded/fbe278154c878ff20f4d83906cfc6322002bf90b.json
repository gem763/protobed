Ireland doesn\u2019t have any bulk commercial mill at all and imports the rest of its flour from the UK,\u201d said Michael Bell, the executive director of Northern Ireland\u2019s Food and Drink Association.\n\nUnder a no-deal Brexit, flour would be subject to a tariff of \u20ac172 a tonne, which could add around 15 cents to the price of a humble sliced loaf.\n\nHow a no-deal Brexit threatens your weekly food shop Read more\n\n\u201cWe are not talking about there being no bread on the shelves, but that it is just going to be more expensive and depending on your income that will be more or less significant,\u201d said Alex Waugh, the director general of the National Association of British and Irish Millers (Nabim).\n\nIn a no-deal scenario, EU tariffs will be applicable on a range of food items coming into Ireland from the UK.\n\nThe tariffs on flour will hit bread, biscuits, cakes, confectionary and commercially produced frozen pizza assembled in factories outside Dublin but destined for the massive UK market.\n\nFor Irish bakers, the choices are to absorb the cost, pass it on to the consumer or source flour in France, Germany or Lithuania.\n\n\u201cCan you source the flour in France? No,\u201d said Bell. \u201cTheir mill structure is different and their flour has a different protein content which is good for baguettes but not for high-rise bread.\u201d\n\nBakers have looked at getting flour further afield, in Germany or Lithuania, said Waugh but the cost of getting it back to Ireland added significant overheads and logistical challenges.\n\nCurrently, Ireland imports about 150-170 28-tonne tankers of flour a week from UK, with one third from Northern Ireland and two-thirds from Britain.\n\n'No deal will be a total disaster': Irish agri-food sector on high alert Read more\n\nBakers south of the border are looking at stockpiling flour but that is not considered a sustainable solution.\n\n\u201cIt is the thing that people often forget in this debate, that tariffs are a tax and they are a tax on consumers because there just isn\u2019t sufficient margin in the supply chain to fully absorb so the costs will be passed on,\u201d says Paul Kelly, director of the Food and Drink Industry Ireland.\n\nHe sees a no-deal Brexit as a disastrous misapplication of tariffs, which are designed as a tool to protect European farmers and food production for social reasons.\n\n\u201cThe social contract operating here is that farmers have a high cost base because of the high cost of living in the EU, high standards of regulation and safety that they have to adhere to,\u201d he says.\n\nBell thinks the British government simply doesn\u2019t consider food production seriously enough or understand that the supply chains on the two islands are so interconnected because of the efficiencies needed to keep prices down.\n\n\u201cSome supermarkets have said: \u2018Tariffs are not our problem, it\u2019s the suppliers\u2019 problem.\u2019 Suppliers are saying: \u2018We beg to differ.\u2019 They are saying they are not going to take it at all, which means suppliers will end up having to break contracts because they won\u2019t be able to supply at below cost,\u201d says Bell.", "description": "Flour from UK would be subject to tariff of \u20ac172 a tonne - adding 15 cents to the price of loaf", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/824d27a72e98a55acca3cdaf054de8409b19d6fa/0_248_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=59c13f49de98b0ec1dc4e12f81ec0d3b", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
