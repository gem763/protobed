But now I feel deeply connected to this place and to Africa.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry makes touching tribute to late mom Princess Diana on a solo trip to Botswana. @MaggieRulli has the latest. https://t.co/5jSKcvApgUpic.twitter.com/hZfO1t7FrD \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) September 26, 2019\n\nPrincess Diana passed away in August 1997 when Harry was just 12 years old. Harry also used a large center diamond from Botswana on Meghan\u2019s engagement ring, which was flanked by two diamonds from his mother's private collection.\n\nThe next solo stop for Harry on his tour is Angola, a country which also had special meaning for the Princess of Wales. Harry will be visiting the same locations that his mom did in 1997, just months before her death.\n\nDiana\u2019s work with landmines changed the nation for the better.\n\nOn Thursday, Harry had a message of conservation for reporters, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone that\u2019s not involved in conservation that shouldn\u2019t be involved in conservation somehow.\u201d\n\nFor more from the royal tour of Africa, watch the clip below:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nMeghan Markle Has the Cutest Nickname for Son Archie\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry Bring Archie to Meet Archbishop Desmond Tutu\n\nInside Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's Royal Tour of Africa and Their Special Tribute to Princess Diana\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "He visited the country in the late \u201890s following the untimely death of his mother.", "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NKTtYoDUBNOHdarmDTIt_w--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/2c4fda5a527cdf6a806b7f2c17138b89", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
