(Reuters; AP/Left: Reuters; Right: AP)\n\nWhen you think about it now, it\u2019s sort of amazing that people gossiped and speculated about the identity of Deep Throat \u2014 the source Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein relied on during Watergate \u2014 for 30 years without the use of Twitter.\n\nThis week, the Twitter sleuths were out in full force, trying to figure out the identity of the whistleblower whose complaint about President Trump\u2019s conduct has fueled an impeachment push. On Thursday, acting national intelligence chief Joseph Maguire said he did not know who the whistleblower is, but kept referring to him using male pronouns. The New York Times published a report identifying him as a CIA officer who had once worked at the White House, drawing condemnation from readers who said the Times was endangering his safety.\n\n[Whistleblower, working in stealth, almost single-handedly set impeachment in motion]\n\nAnd a former CIA official wrote in the New York Post that the whistleblower had to be a law professor and not an intelligence official because \u2014 wait for it \u2014 the complaint included \u201cdetailed footnotes.\u201d\n\nNo one expects his anonymity to last as long as Deep Throat\u2019s did.\n\nRichard Nixon became the only president in American history to resign in 1974. It wasn\u2019t until 2005 that W. Mark Felt, the associate director of the FBI during Watergate, revealed he was the one who provided crucial information to Washington Post reporters Woodward and Bernstein during their investigation into the Watergate break-in and coverup.\n\nThus ended decades of speculation in bars, law schools and late-night tabloid shows, where Deep Throat was fingered as Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist; Secretary of State Henry Kissinger; Nixon speechwriter Pat Buchanan; a composite of several people; and even journalist Diane Sawyer, who was once an assistant in Nixon\u2019s White House press office.\n\nPerhaps if Twitter had existed in those years, the matter would have been resolved sooner, because there was someone who knew who Deep Throat was, and that someone was a) a master of brevity and wit, b) married to Bernstein for a time and c) eager to blab to anyone who would listen about Felt.\n\nBut no one believed her.\n\nThat someone was Nora Ephron, the filmmaker behind classic romantic comedies like \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally,\u201d \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail.\u201d\n\nBefore she became beloved by witty women the world over, Ephron was married to Bernstein for four years, from 1976 to 1980. As she recounted later, Bernstein refused to reveal Deep Throat\u2019s identity to her. But she learned that before The Post\u2019s managing editor Howard Simons gave the source the pornographic moniker \u201cDeep Throat,\u201d Woodward had referred to the source as \u201cM.F.\u201d in his notes.\n\nWoodward always insisted that stood for \u201cMy Friend,\u201d but Ephron didn\u2019t believe him, correctly guessing the initials stood for \u201cMark Felt.\u201d When she confronted Bernstein with her conclusion, he denied it.\n\nYears later, Woodward admitted to NBC News that using \u201cM.F.\u201d was \u201cnot very good trade craft on my part.\u201d\n\n\n\nScreenwriter Nora Ephron, right, is shown with her then-husband, journalist and author Carl Bernstein, and poet Rose Burgunder in New York on Feb. 22, 1978. (Richard Drew/AP)\n\nIn fact, as Woodward explained later, he had met Felt by chance before he was even a journalist. Both men had ended up in a White House waiting room when Felt was lower on the chain in the FBI and Woodward was a Navy courier. Woodward struck up a conversation and, over the years, asked Felt for career advice. Eventually, the mentor-mentee relationship changed when Felt came to Woodward to leak information about Watergate.\n\nIn 1979, while Ephron was pregnant with her and Bernstein\u2019s second child, she discovered her husband was having an affair with a mutual friend. The couple divorced. A few years later, Ephron wrote a fictionalized version of the split in the novel \u201cHeartburn\u201d; she later wrote the screenplay for a film based on the book.\n\n[\u2018I\u2019m a political prisoner\u2019: Mouthy Martha Mitchell was the George Conway of the Nixon era]\n\nOver the years, as Ephron\u2019s reputation for great movies and bluntness grew, she told hundreds of people the truth: her kids, her friends, rooms full of adoring fans.\n\n\u201cIf I gave a speech with 500 people, and [someone] asked me, I told them,\u201d she told NPR in 2006. \u201cI told everyone. But no one listened to me. It was very, very, very frustrating \u2026 I was like a tree falling in the forest that no one hears.\u201d\n\nAt times, she later wrote, she suffered in non-silence as \u201cunbelievably idiotic ideas of who Deep Throat was were floated by otherwise intelligent people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy these people with these ludicrous theories didn\u2019t call me I cannot imagine,\u201d she joked. \u201cI am listed\u201d in the phone book.\n\nEphron\u2019s son Jacob Bernstein, apparently inheriting his mother\u2019s propensity for indiscretion, also told classmates in grade school what he had overheard from his mom. In 1999, the Hartford Courant ran an article about a 19-year-old college student who claimed Jacob had told him Felt was Deep Throat when the two attended a day camp together a decade earlier.\n\nWhen the Courant contacted Bernstein, he laughed off his son\u2019s claim, saying he \u201chas not a clue as to the identity of Deep Throat.\u201d\n\nThere was also someone else who denied it: 86-year-old Mark Felt.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not me,\u201d Felt fibbed to the Courant. \u201cI would have done better. I would have been more effective. Deep Throat didn\u2019t exactly bring the White House crashing down, did he?\u201d\n\n(Felt also denied it to the Wall Street Journal in 1974, cryptically adding that if he were Deep Throat, he obviously wouldn\u2019t admit it.)\n\nBut by 2005, he had changed his mind, and revealed all to Vanity Fair.\n\nFortunately, Ephron, who died of complications from cancer in 2012, lived long enough to be vindicated and to gloat about it in the way only she could.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that this is a huge load off my mind. Mark Felt is Deep Throat,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t try to tell you.\u201d\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nHow the Founding Fathers saw impeachment and \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors\u2019\n\nThat time Nixon released doctored transcripts during Watergate\n\nReagan called President Nixon to slur Africans as \u2018monkeys.\u2019 Of course there are tapes.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a political prisoner\u2019: Mouthy Martha Mitchell was the George Conway of the Nixon era", "description": "Nobody expects the Trump whistleblower\u2019s anonymity to last as long as Mark Felt\u2019s did.
