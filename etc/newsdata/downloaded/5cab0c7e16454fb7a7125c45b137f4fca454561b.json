Some of the fires were reportedly started by protesting Afghan locals, angry at being caught in the middle of the conflict.\n\nThe spokesman, Nasrat Rahimi, said some 400 foreigners had been rescued in the wake of the attack.\n\nThe Green Village was previously hit by a suicide car bomber in January. That attack also coincided with a development regarding America's role in the country, as the US envoy was visiting the capital to brief the Afghan government on his negotiations with the Taliban on ending America's longest war.\n\nHours before Monday's attack, Zalmay Khalilzad showed a draft deal to the Afghan president after declaring that they are \"at the threshold of an agreement\" following the end of the ninth round of US-Taliban talks in Qatar.\n\nThe agreement still needs President Donald Trump's approval.\n\nShaken Kabul residents question whether any agreement with the Taliban can be trusted, especially as foreign troops withdraw.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why the Taliban would continue to carry out such attacks when the militant group appears to be getting what it wants in a deal with the US \u2014 a troop withdrawal. The group wants all of the some 20,000 US and NATO troops out of Afghanistan immediately, while the US seeks a withdrawal in phases that would depend on the Taliban meeting certain conditions such as a reduction in violence.\n\nAttacks have surged in recent months, including Taliban assaults on two provincial capitals over the weekend, as the group seeks to strengthen its negotiating position not only with the US but with the Afghan government in the even more challenging intra-Afghan talks that are meant to follow a US-Taliban deal on Afghanistan's future.\n\nSome analysts have warned that some factions of the Taliban might be expressing displeasure with the US deal, though Taliban political leaders at the talks in Qatar have insisted that their tens of thousands of fighters would respect whatever agreement is reached.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\nRead more\n\nIt\u2019ll take more than the US-Taliban deal to keep extremist groups away\n\nTaliban take patients hostage in \u2018massive attack\u2019 on Afghan city\n\nKabul wedding suicide bombing highlights Afghanistan tensions\n\nAfghanistan wedding suicide bombing kills at least 63 people in Kabul", "description": "A major Taliban suicide attack on an affluent area of Kabul has killed at least 16 people and injured more than 100 others.The attack came just hours after the US said it had agreed a deal \"in principle\" with the Taliban for the withdrawal of around 5,000 troops from Afghanistan.", "authors": ["Adam Withnall"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BIHhKXfOP9JNGflyaKdyew--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/00ac89a3b2d4464236846b1e4a89d5cc"}
