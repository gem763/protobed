The most surprising element in FB's rally is that this upward move has survived regulatory probes, fines, and general mistrust about this social media platform.\n\nFacebook's shares have surged more than 40% this year, to close on Friday at $185.67. This strong rebound comes after a tumultuous 2018, during which the shares plunged 26%, sapping investor confidence with a variety of high-profile setbacks, including data breaches, user privacy concerns and the political manipulation of its platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook price chart\n\nThough its stock is still trading below 14% from the all-time high that it hit last summer, the powerful move this year defies a doomsday scenario where bears predicted a collapse in sales. For the that ended on June 30, Facebook reported a 28% gain in sales, beating analysts\u2019 consensus forecast.\n\nGoing forward, there is no guarantee that the challenges will go away for the world\u2019s largest social media platform. In the latest conference call with analysts in July, the company\u2019s chief financial officer warned that Facebook\u2019s slowdown in revenue growth could extend beyond this year, as growing limitations on how much personal data Facebook can collect and use for ads will make it tough to make money through advertising sales.\n\nThere is no doubt that the regulatory oversight and antitrust probes will continue to pose a major challenge to social media companies\u2019 future growth as politicians and regulators try to put together a set of rules to control and stem misuse. But when it comes to Facebook, investors are becoming more confident about CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s ability to produce market-beating returns and downplaying the company\u2019s conservative tone.\n\nHere are the two main reasons behind this optimism:\n\n1. User Growth\n\nOne of the key metrics that is life and death for any social media company is its user- engagement. Over the past several quarters, there has been a clear trend emerging when it comes to Facebook\u2019s main app. The growth in the platforms main revenue-generation regions \u2014 North America and Europe \u2014 is stagnating.\n\nThe number of daily users of the Facebook social network and the company\u2019s Messenger app rose to 1.6 billion people in the second quarter, with a growth rate of 8% from a year ago \u2014 the second-slowest in the company\u2019s history.\n\nWhile growth at the main Facebook app has slowed, the company is still adding users quickly on other properties. A total of 2.7 billion people use at least one Facebook-owned app \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or FB Messenger \u2014 every month, making its the world\u2019s largest social network.\n\n2. New Growth Drivers\n\nWhat\u2019s keeping investors excited about Facebook\u2019s prospects is its ability to continue attracting ad dollars with its 2.7 billion users on different platforms. A key growth area is the company\u2019s Stories features, which are full-screen photos and videos users can post on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.\n\nFacebook\u2019s move into e-commerce via its Instagram and What\u2019sApp apps could add billions of dollars to its revenue within a few years. The Instagram photo-sharing app, which has ads in its photo feed and recently added e-commerce tools, is becoming a more significant part of the business.\n\nTo deal with a possible slowdown in its advertising business, Facebook is pushing into new areas, including payments and e-commerce. Zuckerberg said that now that Facebook users are linked to large networks of people and organizations, his next step is to help them derive value from those connections.\n\nIn June, Facebook said it is expanding its video-on-demand service, Watch, and has teamed up with global publishers to bring their content to the Watch platform. Deutsche Bank analysts believe that Watch could contribute $5 billion in revenues by 2021.\n\nThese growth initiatives are in addition to the company\u2019s controversial cryptocurrency project, Libra, which is facing global resistance since it was announced in June. According to Facebook, the main purpose of Libra is to enable people to use and transfer money around the globe more cheaply than current options allow, and that adding Libra would be most useful in countries where banking options are scant and the home currency is volatile.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAfter a powerful rally this year, Facebook shares are weathering the increased volatility in markets much better than other tech stocks. FB\u2019s continued ability to drive engagement and monetization of its existing properties make its stock a solid long-term bet, despite the recent setbacks on the regulatory front.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: Apple Inc, Netflix Inc, Facebook Inc.
