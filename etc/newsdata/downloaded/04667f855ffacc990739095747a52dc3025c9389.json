REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nDeveloped by Eli Lilly and Co\u2019s (LLY.N) Loxo Oncology and marketed by German drugmaker Bayer (BAYGn.DE), it fights a rare genetic mutation that appears in less than 1% of solid tumors, regardless of where they appear in the body.\n\nFinding those patients will require widespread adoption of sophisticated tests that look for multiple genetic alterations that could be driving the cancer.\n\nSo far, progress has been slow.\n\nAdoption of so-called next-generation sequencing (NGS) tests has been stalled by lack of reimbursement from insurers over concerns that the evidence is not there yet to support widescale use, according to more than a dozen interviews with oncologists and pharmaceutical and diagnostic industry executives.\n\nAs a result, pharma companies from small biotech Blueprint Medicines Corp (BPMC.O) to larger rivals Lilly and Roche Holding AG (ROG.S) are taking matters into their own hands, bulking up staff to increase patient and physician awareness about testing and building up a gene testing infrastructure that for many community hospitals still does not exist.\n\nBayer executives told Reuters it plans to spend $70 million to increase patient and physician awareness of testing for rare mutations and to encourage regulatory approval of more tests. They expect that budget to expand as Vitrakvi continues to win approval in other countries.\n\nLilly told Reuters the company has signed an agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO.N) to develop a companion diagnostic test for its experimental drug, LOXO-292.\n\nThe deal adds RET mutations - the target of both Lilly\u2019s and Blueprint\u2019s drugs - to Thermo\u2019s Oncomine Dx Target Test, which local pathology labs can use to identify multiple genes linked with non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nThe agreement is aimed to help identify more lung and thyroid cancer patients who may benefit from the Lilly or Blueprint therapies. The Thermo test is already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration - a key standard for Medicare coverage, the companies said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Brian Alexander, chief medical officer of Roche\u2019s gene testing company Foundation Medicine, only about 15% of U.S. patients with advanced cancers get comprehensive genomic profiling. Another 25% get single-gene testing, he said, and a large proportion \u201care not getting any testing at all.\u201d\n\nAt MD Anderson, which sees 100,000 new cancer patients a year, only around 10,000 eventually have their tumors sequenced.\n\nFor a rare few, the tests are lifesaving.\n\nXin Zheng, 47, a mother of three in Michigan who was referred to Reuters by Blueprint, was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in 2016. After failing several treatments, she was out of options.\n\nHer husband, Zhigang Wei, asked for genetic sequencing, and the test turned up a RET mutation. After contacting multiple lung cancer experts, Zhigang found an early-stage clinical trial treating patients with Blueprint\u2019s experimental drug, BLU-677.\n\nNow, Xin is nearly back to normal.\n\n\u201cMy wife is lucky,\u201d he said, adding her quality of life is much better and she has hope for the future.\n\nFinding patients with such rare mutations is like \u201clooking for the needle in the haystack,\u201d said Stefan Oelrich, head of pharmaceuticals at Bayer.\n\nDr. David Hyman of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who tested Vitrakvi in clinical trials, said making these tests the norm for advanced cancer patients will require a huge shift in the way oncology is practiced.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s painful to know there are patients out there with these alterations who are dying without knowing about it and without getting any treatments,\u201d he said.\n\nNOT GETTING TESTED\n\nFor Bayer\u2019s Vitrakvi and Roche\u2019s Rozlytrek, along with similar drugs in development, genomic testing is critical to finding patients who can benefit from them.\n\nCancer patients and drug companies alike got a boost last year when the federal Medicare health program for the elderly and disabled said it would cover FDA-approved tests for advanced cancer patients that can identify hundreds of genetic mutations at once. A Medicare endorsement is generally followed by widespread coverage decisions by private insurers.\n\nBut the final regulations dropped a requirement that testmakers prove the tests are cost-effective and improve patient care. That created an \u201cevidence gap\u201d that has allowed some insurers, also known as third-party payers, to withhold coverage or demand more proof that they benefit patients, said Jeff Schreier of Diaceutics PLC (DXRX.L), a data analytics company that works with drugmakers to improve diagnostic testing.\n\n\u201cMore payers are coming around, but it\u2019s slow,\u201d he said.\n\nThe most recent coverage policy from CVS Health Corp\u2019s (CVS.N) Aetna approves many single-gene tests for specific cancers, but still largely considers multi-gene tests experimental. Anthem Inc\u2019s (ANTM.N) policy limits testing to \u201cmedically necessary\u201d use and states there\u2019s \u201cinsufficient published evidence\u201d to support widespread testing.\n\nAnd while Foundation Medicine\u2019s and Thermo Fisher\u2019s tests are getting reimbursed from Medicare, many hospitals such as MD Anderson, which have developed their own tests, are not guaranteed payment. \u201cReimbursement is still a driving force,\u201d MD Anderson\u2019s Kenna Shaw said of genomic testing, which costs an average of $5,000 per patient globally.\n\nLilly bought Loxo in January for $8 billion to profit from its targeted drugs in early-stage development. Bayer secured the rights to Loxo\u2019s two leading compounds in a 2017 alliance.\n\nDr. Anthony Sireci, Loxo\u2019s senior medical director, said the company has been working to \u201cdemocratize\u201d testing in the United States by increasing its use in local pathology labs, where most cancer testing has traditionally been done. The Thermo Fisher agreement will support those goals and expand patients\u2019 access to \u201chigh-quality genomic testing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTEST YOUR CANCER\u201d\n\nBayer has hired diagnostic experts to help its medical and sales staff assess the barriers to genomic testing and ensure that local pathology labs are including the genetic alterations targeted by its drugs when they profile tumors, the company\u2019s oncology strategic business chief Robert LaCaze said in an interview.\n\nBayer also launched a public awareness campaign called \u201cTest Your Cancer\u201d that urges patients to ask their doctors about genomic cancer testing. The company is working with testing providers to ensure test reports are easy to understand.\n\nBlueprint, which has six genomically-targeted drugs in development, told Reuters it plans to hire six diagnostics experts to increase awareness of the mutations their drugs target, especially in community medical practices, where 70% of cancers are treated.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Xin Zheng and Zhigang Wei are pictured on a family trip to Crater Lake, Oregon, U.S. in this July 2018 handout photo obtained by Reuters August 30, 2019. Zhigang Wei/Handout via REUTERS\n\nBayer sees signs of progress. Based on internal data, the company estimates average sequencing rates across tumors neared 30% last year, and the company saw a two-fold increase in the number of labs offering tests that carry the mutation targeted by Vitrakvi.\n\nBayer has not released sales figures for Vitrakvi.\n\nAsked for an update in the most recent earnings call in July, Bayer\u2019s Oelrich said uptake is going \u201caccording to plan,\u201d but declined to say how many patients are using the drug. LaCaze said with very rare cancers like the ones Vitrakvi targets, sales growth is \u201csomething that will build over time.\u201d", "description": "In the halls of MD Anderson Cancer Center, the drug Vitrakvi is known for having a \"Lazarus effect\" in some patients because it can reverse late-stage cancer that has defied all other treatment options.", "authors": ["Julie Steenhuysen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426800429&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850HK", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
