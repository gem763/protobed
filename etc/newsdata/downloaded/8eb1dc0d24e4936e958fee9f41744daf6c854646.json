According to a report by CNET, the company has sent an invite for an event scheduled for next month that hints towards a flip phone\u2019s launch.\n\nThe invite shows a device folding and unfolding with \u201cAn original, unlike any other\u201d tagline. CNET adds the invite says, \u201cYou\u2019re going to flip.\u201d\n\nSince the beginning of the year, we\u2019ve been hearing rumors of Motorola bringing the sexy back with a foldable Razr.\n\nWe\u2019ve even got a couple of glimpses of how the phone looks too. Unlike Google\u2019s overtly leaked Pixel, not much known about Moto\u2019s foldable. A report by XDA Developers from May noted the phone will be powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 710 processor, and will have a 6.2-inch foldable display. It might have 6 or 8GB of RAM, and 2,730 mAh battery.\n\nThis year has been disastrous for foldables. Samsung has been criticized for the Galaxy Fold\u2019s build quality, and Huawei hasn\u2019t gotten around to releasing its Mate X yet. If Motorola gets this upcoming crowd favorite wrong, you can expect fans to flip out.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F04%2Fnew-motorola-razr-2019-leaks-out-102.jpg&signature=01ad5d7c6de0127afb46208a0522c367", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
