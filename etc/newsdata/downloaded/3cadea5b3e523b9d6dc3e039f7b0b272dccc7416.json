They had been demonstrating against a recently signed state measure intended to crack down on fraudulent medical exemptions for vaccinations.\n\nAround 5:15 p.m., a woman in the group leaned over the railing and hurled the unidentified red liquid onto the unsuspecting lawmakers. Someone reportedly called out: \u201cThat\u2019s for the dead babies.\u201d\n\nThe Senate called a quick recess and law enforcement evacuated the chambers. A video posted to social media shows a woman, who walked out of the gallery into the hallway, saying, \u201cMy menstrual blood is all over the Senate floor\u2026 a representation of the blood of the dead babies,\u201d before she is then handcuffed.\n\nState Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat, posted on Twitter after the ordeal.\n\n\u201cA few minutes ago, the anti-vaxxer stalkers \u2013 who\u2019ve engaged in a harassment campaign all week \u2013 dropped a red substance onto the Senate floor from the elevated public gallery, dousing several of my colleagues,\u201d Wiener wrote. \u201cThese anti-vaxxers are engaging in criminal behavior. They\u2019ve now repeatedly assaulted senators and are engaging in harassing and intimidating behavior every single day, as we try to do the people\u2019s work. They\u2019re a cancer on the body politic and are attacking democracy.\u201d\n\nThe incident comes after Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed controversial legislation into law this week that places restrictions on medical vaccine exemptions for children. State Sen. Richard Pan, a Democrat representing Sacramento, authored the bill. He was shoved by a protester last week outside the Capitol.\n\n\u201cThis incident was incited by the violent rhetoric perpetuated by leaders of the antivaxx movement,\u201d Pan said in a statement to FOX 40 Sacramento. \u201cAs their rhetoric escalates, their incidents of violence does as well. This is an attack on the democratic process and an assault on all Californians and it must be met with strong condemnation by everyone.\u201d\n\nSenate Bill 276 and SB 714 intend to increase oversight on California\u2019s vaccine medical exemption system, according to the Sacramento Bee. Doctors in the state will be required to submit a form to the state Department of Public Health every time they issue a medical exemption. Public health officials will be alerted when doctors issue more than five exemptions a year and review each exemption case to evaluate if fraud is being committed. The system will also flag schools that fall below a 95 percent vaccination rate.\n\nSupporters argue the new legislation would protect children who are too sick or young to be vaccinated from being exposed to preventable diseases while at school, according to the Bee. Those in opposition to the new law say vaccines are not universally safe and that the measure would infringe on the patient-doctor relationship.\n\nProtesters camped outside the governor\u2019s office this week as others in opposition to the legislation crowded hallways in Sacramento\u2019s Capitol building and attempted to disrupt hearings and floor sessions, the Los Angeles Times reported. The group responsible for organizing the rally outside the Capitol denounced the woman\u2019s behavior Friday.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe strongly denounce this, it goes far beyond crossing a line,\u201d Jonathan Lockwood, executive director of Conscience Coalition, told the Sacramento Bee.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSenate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins said in a statement: \u201cCalifornia\u2019s legislative process, as well as our doors, should remain open to all who wish to observe or speak out on a variety of issues, but we cannot allow anyone to endanger others. The behavior that occurred in the Senate Chamber is unacceptable and has been dealt with by Capitol law enforcement. We will continue to do the people\u2019s important business.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A protester was taken into custody at the\u00a0California\u00a0Statehouse in Sacramento on Friday evening after she allegedly threw a feminine hygiene device containing \"what appeared to be blood\" onto the floor of the state Senate from a public viewing area, splashing the liquid onto\u00a0lawmakers working below.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/period-blood-on-paper.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
