That may have been the case when a misquoted Hillary Clinton remark about Tulsi Gabbard began a war of words with the Hawaii congresswoman, which led to rampant speculation that Gabbard would run for president as a third-party spoiler. When Gabbard announced on Friday that she was not running for reelection to the House next year, some nervous Democrats likely concluded she was thinking about becoming the next Jill Stein, as HRC had feared (on review, HRC said she thought Gabbard was being groomed by Republicans \u2014 not Russians, as was originally reported \u2014 for a third-party gig). But then word got out she had already foresworn the third-party scenario early this week:\n\nDon\u2019t worry, U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard says, she\u2019s still a Democrat and has no intention of running for president as a third-party candidate. Gabbard made the assertion in front of an audience of about 400 women, many of them business leaders and CEOs, who were gathered in downtown Washington, D.C., on Tuesday for Fortune\u2019s annual Most Powerful Women Summit.\n\nA questioner specifically mentioned Clinton\u2019s theories about Gabbard\u2019s plans, which didn\u2019t seem to make any difference to her. She did not repeat her earlier references to HRC as \u201cthe queen of warmongers\u201d and as \u201cthe personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long,\u201d but she did say this:\n\n\u201cI am calling out my own party and I am calling out what I have seen as a corrupted influence in our party that\u2019s taken it away from the party of the people that it needs to be,\u201d Gabbard said during Tuesday\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to run as a third party candidate. I\u2019m running for the Democratic nomination to lead the Democratic Party and take it back from those who have been advocating for waging more regime change wars and serving interests other than the interests of the people.\u201d\n\nSo why has she already foresworn a congressional reelection bid? She does not, after all, have much of a chance to win the presidential nomination, which may, in any event, be won by someone like Elizabeth Warren who isn\u2019t exactly a Clinton-style centrist.\n\nThe explanation is pretty uncomplicated: She was in some trouble back home, and would have probably had to abandon her presidential bid altogether to secure her seat, as Politico reports:\n\n[H]er path to winning a fifth term in 2020 was complicated by a formidable primary challenge from state Sen. Kai Kahele, as well as her thorny relationships with other Aloha State politicians.\n\nA trio of former Hawaii governors have backed Kahele\u2019s bid to unseat Gabbard, and she ignited a feud with Sen. Mazie Hirono after authoring an op-ed in January accusing Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee of \u201creligious bigotry\u201d in their questioning of a nominee for a district judgeship.\n\nHirono, a member of that panel who previously held Gabbard\u2019s House seat, criticized the congresswoman and called her assertions \u201ctotally unfounded\u201d during an interview in March.\n\nNow Gabbard can concentrate on being a gadfly in national Democratic politics.", "description": "After a misquoted Hillary Clinton remark about Tulsi Gabbard considering a third-party presidential bid caused a firestorm, the Hawaiian announced she\u2019s not running for reelection to Congress \u2014 but she won\u2019t go third-party, either.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/25/25-tulsi-gabbard.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
