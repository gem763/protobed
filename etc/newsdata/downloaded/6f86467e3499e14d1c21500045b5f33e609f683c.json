(it) is such a remote spot, in the middle of fields.\n\n\"You see it can happen anywhere. Not only in a big city but also in the countryside. And perhaps even more in the countryside, where you\n\ncan hide completely.\"\n\nVan Dijk said she and her husband had seen a man driving in and out of the property for years and doing construction work.\n\nHe always kept the gates closed and never socialised, she said.\n\n(Image: Hollandse Hoogte/REX)\n\nHer husband Sjon said he once asked to see how the renovations were coming along, but the man yelled \"no\" and sped off.\n\n\"We tried to make contact, my husband just last week, with the man in the car...(But) he drove on. He went through the gates and locked them again.\"\n\nAnother homeowner in the area said: \"We are quite perplexed about it all.\"\n\nThe siblings had reportedly lived in makeshift rooms inside the farm and survived partly on vegetables and animals from a secluded garden on the property.\n\n(Image: Hollandse Hoogte/REX)\n\nBut in a statement, police said they found the family in a \"small space in the house which could be locked\" and that it was unclear whether they were being held against their will.\n\n\"The man is still in custody and is being questioned,\" said a Drenthe police spokeswoman.\n\n\"A lot is still unclear and we are investigating exactly what happened there.\"", "description": "Police in Drenthe, Netherlands, have detained a 58-year-old over the incident at a remote farmhouse", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Wilbert Bijzitter Epa-Efe Rex", "Hollandse Hoogte Press Association Images", "Hollandse Hoogte Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586619.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Father-with-children-has-been-in-cellar-in-Drenthe-for-years-Ruinerwold-Netherlands-15-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
