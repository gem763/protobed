Vicky Pattison and Neil Ruddock had more chance of beating Greg Rutherford at long jump than they did of defeating him in the kitchen tonight\n\nPlus, of course, his culinary skills were obviously superior, even when the contest started.\n\nFinally, arguably most importantly, there was Rutherford\u2019s \u2018competitive spirit\u2019 (or sheer desire to win), which he had not so much learnt during his days competing for Great Britain as basically carried over in to Celebrity Masterchef.\n\nIf this seemed ridiculous or simplistic, Greg was at least good enough to connect the two himself.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t have the Olympics anymore. I have a Masterchef final,\u2019 he stated unequivocally, before taking it much further by claiming: \u2018And I\u2019m putting the same amount of effort that I put into winning an Olympic gold medal into trying to win the Masterchef trophy.\u2019\n\nTrying her best: Vicky Pattison also wanted to win but not in the same way. More in the opposite way: like someone who had never really won anything, at least based on talent\n\nThis clearly wasn\u2019t true as he acknowledged later, after he\u2019d won, sobbing: \u2018I didn\u2019t practice for 15 years to get to this point. I learnt it in 6 or 7 weeks.\u2019\n\nBut the fact he even compared them confirmed Greg was never going to let anyone else stop him taking home the trophy.\n\n\u2018Razor\u2019 Ruddock was also a former sportsman (a footballer for West Ham, amongst others). But despite making an analogy with the FA Cup and the league title, didn\u2019t quite have the same approach.\n\nIt in to win it! \u2018Razor\u2019 Ruddock sadly didn't do enough to beat out Rutherford\n\nHe wanted to win, he said, but was looking forward to \u2018going home and having a cuddle with the wife\u2019 just as much.\n\nGreg Rutherford meanwhile was still comparing Celebrity Masterchef to the Olympics.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been in scenarios before where you can almost taste a medal and sometimes it doesn\u2019t happen. And it really is gutting because you\u2019ve put so much effort into it.\u2019\n\nHosts: John Torode and Greg Wallace were of course on hand to judge their offerings\n\nGreg\u2019s menu was predictably spectacular: a starter of a Scotch egg wrapped in chorizo, \u2018which I\u2019m putting in a sort of rosti nest\u2019 (made of curried potato), with asparagus tips and spicy mayonnaise.\n\nRack of lamb with a herb crust for the main course, served with savoy cabbage, baby carrots, potatoes, and two purees (onion & garlic and mushroom). Then for dessert a dark chocolate crema, layered with raspberry mousse and Chantilly cream.\u2019\n\n\u2018For crying out loud!\u2019 cried Gregg Wallace (loudly). \u2018I knew Greg would go for it today. But I didn\u2019t realize just how ambitious.\u2019\n\nGreg Rutherford, predictably, agreed.\n\nYum! Greg\u2019s menu was predictably spectacular: a starter of a Scotch egg wrapped in chorizo, \u2018which I\u2019m putting in a sort of rosti nest\u2019 (made of curried potato), with asparagus tips and spicy mayonnaise\n\nTasty: Rack of lamb with a herb crust for the main course, served with savoy cabbage, baby carrots, potatoes, and two purees (onion & garlic and mushroom). Then for dessert a dark chocolate crema, layered with raspberry mousse and Chantilly cream'\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve given myself SO many things to do!\u2019 he lamented, hoping that he managed to make everything in the allotted time.\n\nIt seemed to think it would somehow be unfair if he didn\u2019t and it jeopardized his chances.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve worked incredibly hard to get to this point,\u2019 he stated flatly, even though he hadn\u2019t really.\n\nHe justified it though, on the grounds: \u2018I have a young family and I want to spent time with them. That does make something like this quite difficult.\u2019\n\nHopeful: Vicky admitted she had come a long way and hoped to win the show\n\nPoor Greg! But he bravely soldiered on.\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s been an incredible journey. I can\u2019t complain in any way, shape or form,\u2019 he said.\n\nEven though he just had.\n\nVicky Pattison also wanted to win but not in the same way. More in the opposite way: like someone who had never really won anything, at least based on talent.\n\nOverjoyed! Greg couldn't hide his delight as he celebrated his win\n\n\u2018When you\u2019re this close it\u2019s just agony not to take the crown innit? Agony!\u2019 she said before the final started, admitting openly: \u2018so yeah I want to win!\u2019\n\nOtherwise though it\u2019s safe to say Vicky Pattison\u2019s outlook was slightly different to Greg\u2019s.\n\n\u2018I am taking major proactive steps to make sure I do my best today!\u2019 she rambled at the beginning, adding: \u2018I\u2019ve worn two sports bras ! Two!\u2019\n\nShe didn\u2019t explain how this would help but still\u2026\n\nLater on, while she was making her dessert, there was further evidence that Vicky had perhaps had too much chocolate.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve allowed myself to imagine winning the trophy!\u2019 she explained. \u2018But I do believe in visualizing stuff so I\u2019m kind of torn. I don\u2019t want my sub-conscious to think I\u2019m cocky and the universe to be like \u2018ha-ha! Karma! You\u2019re not going to win.\u2019 But similarly I don\u2019t want to not envisage it then (the universe) would be like \u2018well we didn\u2019t know you wanted it because you didn\u2019t envisage it!\u2019 Do you know what I mean?\u2019\n\nNot really\u2026\n\n\u2018I\u2019m torn \u2013 universally. So to speak\u2026\u2019 she concluded.\n\nGregg Wallace posed probably the dumbest question of the evening, asking the former Geordie Shore star if her cooking had \u2018changed since you first came in here?\u2019\n\nFrom kebabs and toast, you mean?\n\nTo a starter of \u2018Asian tuna tartare on a wasabi avocado puree\u2019, a main course of pistachio-crust lamb with smoked baby potatoes and wild garlic salsa verde\u2019, and for dessert \u2018flourless chocolate tart, Chantilly cream, and raspberries.\u2019\n\nAgain, you had to admire and enjoy Vicky\u2019s attitude as she confessed: \u2018I just think if it hasn\u2019t got chocolate in it it\u2019s not a dessert. So I\u2019m doing a nice gooey cake. I put \u2018tart\u2019 but I don\u2019t really know what it means. I\u2019m just trying to sound fancy.\u2019\n\nEven more than this, she deserved to win for setting about her potatoes with a mini flame-thrower.\n\n\u2018She is smoking!\u2019 said John Torode, possibly talking about Vicky\u2019s rather than her technique.\n\n\u2018She has set fire to hay!\u2019 he added, more matter-of-factly, as she attempted to give the potatoes inside the hay a barbequed flavor, and inadvertently setting off the smoke alarm.\n\nUnfortunately the lamb itself had not quite been cooked long enough but, gushed Torode, \u2018underneath the lamb is this amazing, vivacious, vibrant, salsa verde that is absolutely delicious!\u2019\n\nEven more unfortunately, Gregg Wallace was uncharacteristically picky, grumbling: \u2018I don\u2019t get any smokiness from those potatoes AT ALL!\u2019\n\nThis prompted the wittiest quip of the night.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m fuming!\u2019 laughed Vicky, not entirely joking. \u2018I nearly blinded myself and lost an eyebrow and the potatoes didn\u2019t even taste like smoke!\u2019\n\nAt the end, the winner, Greg Rutherford, seemed only interested in feeding his ego and reiterating how \u2018special\u2019 his achievement was.\n\nVicky Pattison on the other hand seemed genuinely touched by the praise the judges gave her dessert in particular, and was sweet enough to tell Torode and Wallace: \u2018thank you so much for being so lovely!\u2019\n\nShe\u2019s had a certain amount of flack for her somewhat eccentric, excitable, behaviour during the series.\n\nBut showed a different side to herself when it was over: more complicated and sensitive than people might assume.\n\n\u2018It would have been fantastic to win but I feel like I\u2019ve won really. This gave us a creative outlet, something positive in my life. Through learning to cook and learning to love something else, I sort of learnt to love myself a bit again. I consider that a win, trophy or not\u2026\u2019\n\n\u2018I was doubting myself when I first got here. Now I have a real sense of self. I\u2019ve really loved learning something new and finding myself again.\u2019\n\nThis was surely more important and powerful than something akin to a gold medal.", "description": "JIM SHELLEY: Vicky Pattison and Neil Ruddock had more chance of beating Greg Rutherford at long jump than they did of defeating him in the kitchen tonight.", "authors": ["Jim Shelley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/00/19611622-0-image-a-95_1570836405546.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
