If one doesn't work, they simply adapt, improve and spam it out again, '' said Van Vlaanderen.\n\nTo help you protect yourself against such attacks, Van Vlaanderen shares seven tips:\n\n1. Think you\u2019re being phished? Look at the bait - Check who the email is from. Phishers may use a random email address that gives the game away. Does the address make sense? If any alarm bells start to ring, don\u2019t click.\n\n2. Think hard before opening an attachment - To a cyber criminal, nothing is sacred, said Van Vlaanderen. Wedding invitations, invoices and tax returns are all commonly used tactics. If you find the attachment suspicious, don't open it!\n\n3. Be careful of short URLs - You cannot take for granted that URL shortening services are redirecting you to trustworthy websites.\n\n4. Telephone numbers don't guarantee the validity of the email - The number may work, but you will be connected to a scammer instead of the company you\u2019re hoping to speak to \u2013 and they will attempt to fool you into handing over further details.\n\n5. Don't auto-load images - Set your email messages so your images aren\u2019t automatically downloaded. By turning on pictures in an email, your computer downloads the images from the spammer\u2019s servers, showing that you exist.\n\n6. Is SARS really calling? - Its doubtful SARS will be calling you. If you get weird emails or phone calls, ignore them or hang up.\n\n7. Encryption is the only way to go - If you file online, look for encrypted websites. Ensure that the website you visit has HTTPS in front of the URL. It will typically have a green lock indicating that its a secure connection.", "description": "An antivirus expert lists seven tips to help shield taxpayers from cyber crime attacks.", "authors": ["Compiled Allison Jeftha"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1622/6256fa94035d410cb795e93c9d1c6449.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-19"}
