In an apology, Trudeau admitted to wearing blackface while at high school. Hours later, Global News published a video appearing to show a separate incident with Trudeau wearing dark skin makeup on his face, arms and legs.\n\n", "description": "Justin Trudeau\u00a0has apologised for the second time in 24 hours for wearing blackface - but said he was unable to confirm whether there were further instances yet to come to light", "authors": ["Source"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/929cb8388c9e502d427e8e81032632603d78ef9e/533_79_2618_1571/master/2618.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=92196d2779f24a9a4a3d0650871ae4f7", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
