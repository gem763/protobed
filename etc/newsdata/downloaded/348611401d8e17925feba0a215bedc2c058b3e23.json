I wanted to write a song about it, and it\u2019s similar to other songs as well. I really like watching videos from NASA or watching space movies.\u201dSuch inspiration is visible in the lead track \u201cDear Love,\u201d a song taken from the idea of how molecules that split into two are still connected to each other through quantum entanglement and share their thoughts - something Lim likened to how love works. There may be a person out there who\u2019s connected to you even when you\u2019re halfway across the universe \u201cas if you were one from the beginning,\u201d said Lim.The other tracks also stemmed from Lim\u2019s musings about space. While the title track \u201cRendez-Vous\u201d was written while thinking about what it would actually be like to be in space, \u201cDocking\u201d expresses the beauty of a relationship by comparing it to two spaceships docking. Likewise, \u201cBlack\u201d was inspired by black holes and \u201cMoonlight\u201d by the revolving moon.\u201cI thought as a child when I was praying, I was actually sending a message to space,\u201d Lim said. \u201cSo if I prayed so hard and gave all my heart, then the universe answered by letting that happen. It sounds religious - it isn\u2019t. I just feel more fulfilled to think that something happens because I wanted it to happen.\u201cI even wanted aliens to kidnap me and give me just one superpower - to be able to teleport. I\u2019d like to go to space, Mars or Jupiter. Apparently, the Earth looks so beautiful from there. I\u2019d like to see that. And who knows? The songs might be a big hit on other planets.\u201dLim had already proven himself as a songwriter as a part of BtoB, birthing some of the group\u2019s biggest hits such as \u201cMissing You\u201d (2017), \u201cOnly One for Me\u201d (2018) and \u201cBeautiful Pain\u201d (2018). And for his very first EP, he pushed himself to write all the songs, lyrics and even take the lead in rearranging all of the songs by himself, which range from alternative rock, synth pop and ballad.\u201cI listen to diverse genres, and I like all of them,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t really think the idea of genres matters these days. Even with my songs, some people could think they\u2019re ballad-like, while others feel it close to rock. I did want to go with a [rock] band sound, but I think it\u2019s just nice to have the chance to express my own colors through my songs.\u201dBut this is just the beginning for the singer, with more ideas to come gradually in the future. He rates his EP seven out of 10 - not because he doesn\u2019t like his work, but because he has so much more to show.\u201cIt was hard to fill a whole song on my own, when I was used to having seven members with me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are songs that I haven\u2019t shown, and this is an EP. I\u2019d like to show more next time, perhaps with a full-length album. Maybe after I finish my military service? But I didn\u2019t want to rush anything this time.\u201dAccording to Lim, \u201cRendez-Vous\u201d isn\u2019t just a title about love, but also a phrase he\u2019d like to use to describe how he meets with fans as a new solo artist for the first time.\u201cI\u2019ve liked space since I was young - the idea of the universe and aliens. I\u2019ve always wanted to go there, which is why I came up with the question, \u2018What music would I like to listen to when I\u2019m in space?\u2019 I hope that people will listen to it when they\u2019re out there in space,\u201d Lim said.He added, \u201cBut before we get to do that, it will also be nice to listen to at night when you go for a drive, looking at a starry sky.\u201dBY YOON SO-YEON [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/13194537.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
