In RCP average of national polls, Biden lead Aug 1 was 15.6 points. Sept 1 13.5 points. Sept 15 9.7 points. Today: 2.2 points. https://t.co/5mxCW6b5Vb pic.twitter.com/132R97Kxpd \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 3, 2019\n\nFurther, news about the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine seems to be backfiring...and not on President Trump.

These revelations, or at least the way they were filtered through the media outlets used by different groups of voters, just served to confirm preexisting sentiment about the president on both sides,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.\n\nThis particular question is interesting:\n\nMeanwhile, the Biden campaign continues to lash out against any scrutiny of Hunter Biden's business dealings overseas and has been accusing President Trump of abusing his power.", "description": ".10/03/2019 19:23:06PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/cb6dab6e-e3c1-4399-a093-14bfc30b83ac.png"}
