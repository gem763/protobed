Anaheim also won its first three in 2006-07 and last season.\n\nJakob Silfverberg had a goal and an assist and Rickard Rakell also scored for the Ducks. John Gibson made 31 saves.\n\nFilip Hronek scored for Detroit, which lost for the first time this season. Jimmy Howard stopped 26 shots.\n\nAn apparent goal by the Red Wings' Dylan Larkin 8:06 into the third period was overturned because it was ruled the play went into the zone offside, and Ritchie scored on a rebound 1:04 later to give the Ducks a 2-1 lead. Silfverberg made it 3-1, beating Howard from the inside edge of the left circle off the rush, 47 seconds after that.\n\nRakell tied it at 1, 4:52 into the third, when Hampus Lindholm's shot bounced off Rakell, past Howard and into the net. Rakell's first goal followed a turnover by Detroit's Tyler Bertuzzi at his own blue line.\n\nHronek scored with 5 seconds left in the second period after hitting the goal post twice \u2014 one from each circle \u2014 during the previous 15 seconds or so.\n\nThe defenseman finally beat Gibson with a one-time slap shot from the left circle for his first goal of the season. It came with Howard out and Detroit playing 6-on-5, because a penalty was being called on the Ducks.\n\nLarkin also hit the goal post for the Red Wings a little less than five minutes into the middle period.\n\nNOTES: Detroit F Andreas Athanasiou made his season debut after missing the first two games with a lower-body injury. ... Anaheim C Sam Steel, who is out with a middle-body injury, skated on Tuesday morning but did not participate in line drills.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDucks: At Pittsburgh on Thursday.\n\nRed Wings: At Montreal on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
