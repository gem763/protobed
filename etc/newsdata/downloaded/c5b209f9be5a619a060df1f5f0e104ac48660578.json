However, Beacon shares slipped 2 per cent to $1.13.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Beacon Lighting remains closely aligned to the housing sector and anticipates improved housing sales volumes and renovation expenditure in the future to support sales and profit growth in the core business,\" CEO Glen Robinson said.\n\nSouthern Cross Media shares fell 23 per cent to their lowest level since 2014 after the company blamed the weak advertising market for an 8.5 per cent hit to revenue.\n\nSouthern Cross, which owns Australia's largest radio network and operates the Hit and Triple M radio stations, said ad spend had missed expectations for the first quarter and the weakness was felt across radio and television.\n\nAd bookings slowed\n\n\"We're seeing weaker ad markets across first quarter, which seems to be linked to a lower desire to invest and spend in advertising,\" said chief financial officer Nick McKechnie.\n\n\"We're seeing it as being broad in the market. SMI data is showing all sectors were back about 9 per cent. We think it's kind of broad based, linked to the level of consumer and business sentiment in the economy.\"\n\nThe company had predicted in August that ad spend would pick up in September and October, based on a higher number of earlier bookings than the previous year. Instead, the number of ad bookings slowed down.\n\nThe company said it was managing its cost base with \"extra discipline\" to minimise the impact on earnings.\n\n\"That means asking: if someone leaves business, does that role get replaced immediately? Or can we wait a few months? Do we need to spend [the] same amount on travel and other discretionary costs?\" Mr McKechnie said.\n\nNevertheless, UBS analysts cut their 2020 earnings (EBITDA) forecasts by about 7 per cent and earnings per share forecasts by 11 per cent.", "description": "Investors in stocks exposed to discretionary spending are bracing for a series of profit warnings amid growing evidence record low interest rates have not stimulated spending.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_398%2C$y_48/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0a0fe44a526d91fda1dde644bba7bd76e0e676c7", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
