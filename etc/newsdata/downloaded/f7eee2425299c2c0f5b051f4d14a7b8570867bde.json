Unclear yet if we get another \u201cbig drop\u201d across the board, but if we do, I\u2019m eyeing ~$140 to stack up a FAT long. If we break out and start trading above $190 again I\u2019ll long to new highs,\u201d he explained.\n\nThat mini-falling wedge played out on $ETH, looks like a larger one may be forming now.
