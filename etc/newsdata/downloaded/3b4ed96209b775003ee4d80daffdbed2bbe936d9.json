In order to receive updated press passes, more than 10,000 reporters and editors will have to pass a test.\n\nStarting next month, The South China Morning Post reports, journalists will began taking \"pilot tests\" through a state-run app called Xuexi Qiangguo. The app aggregates favorable articles, video clips, and documentaries that illustrate Xi's political philosophy.\n\nA notice issued in August from the Communist Party of China's media oversight office in the propaganda department says the pilot tests will occur before a nationwide exam. Of the five knowledge sections that will be on the test, at least two will be related to Xi's political philosophy, and one will be on Marxism.\n\nJournalists and residents gather around police van during a demonstration.

When the app first launched, journalists were required to download it and register accounts with their real names.\n\nRead more: China cancels plans to visit with US farmers next week\n\nAfter complaints, using the app \u2013 which roughly translates to \"Study Xi, Strong Nation\" \u2013 no longer became mandatory, but it is encouraged.
