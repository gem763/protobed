(Screenshot: Law & Crime)\n\nThe image in question depicts Hepp standing in a bodega wearing a low-cut shirt (stopping short of the standards defined in Pennsylvania\u2019s revenge porn laws).\n\nAs websites have significant liability protection from user-generated content under section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act, Hepp may face long odds against the named platforms, such as Facebook and Reddit, though it would be easier to find anyone who uploaded the photos to those platforms liable.\n\nAccording to Philly Mag, Hepp says she doesn\u2019t know where the photo was specifically taken \u2014 though believes someone took it without her permission in New York \u2014 and is asking for over $15 million as well as the immediate removal of the content:\n\nHepp says in the suit that she\u2019s not exactly sure where the photo in question came from, but the suit narrows it down to an unknown convenience store in New York City. The suit alleges that the photo was taken without her permission. She\u2019s asking that the court order the sites in question to immediately remove her photo. The suit also demands compensatory damages of more than $US10 ($15) million.\n\nHepp\u2019s legal team added in the documents that she \u201cmaintains an exclusive entitlement to control the commercial value of her name and/or likeness and to prevent others from exploiting it without permission\u201d and \u201cwould never have permitted any of the Defendants to use her image to promote prurient and base interests.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Philadelphia Inquirer, the defendants in the suit did not respond to a request for comment, while Fox 29 deferred all questions to Hepp\u2019s attorney, who declined to comment further.", "description": "A Philadelphia-area Fox 29 news anchor, Good Day Philadelphia co-host Karen Hepp, is suing Facebook, Reddit, and other platforms in a U.S. federal court after discovering that a photo of her taken in a convenience store was popping up in dating and erectile dysfunction ads, per the Verge....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Alyse Stanley"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/jzz00btpzl29er6zwvzi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
