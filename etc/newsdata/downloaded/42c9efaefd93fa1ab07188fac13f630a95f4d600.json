First of all, last month the same state court panel (North Carolina law directs such panels to try cases involving constitutional challenges) ruled a contemporaneous state legislative map a violation of state constitutional provisions guaranteeing \u201cfree elections\u201d and equal protection of the law (a very common provision around the country). The congressional map was adopted by the same legislative majority using the same kind of data for the same partisan purposes.\n\nSecond of all, the 2016 map was adopted in response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision invalidating the state\u2019s original 2011 map as representing an illegal racial gerrymander. So the Republicans that drew up the map currently in use went out of their way to advertise their partisan motives, believing they had under the available precedents a clear right to pursue a partisan gerrymander, as the New York Times explains:\n\nSeeking to avoid any appearance of bias, party leaders said publicly they would draw the new map using political rather than racial parameters, a strategy they said at the time was completely legal. One of the map\u2019s principal drafters boasted in 2016 that he had given Republicans a 10-to-3 edge in seats \u201cbecause I do not believe it\u2019s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats \u2026\n\nRepublicans defended the House map on the same grounds in a federal lawsuit, and won at the Supreme Court in June. But in the process, the three-judge panel noted, they left \u201ca detailed record of both the partisan intent and the intended partisan effect of the 2016 congressional districts.\u201d\n\nThat record was so extensive, the judges said, that it left little doubt that opponents of the map would be able to prove in a trial that it violated the State Constitution.\n\nThe state court panel basically told legislators they\u2019d better fix the maps posthaste, since they were going to be invalidated. In similar circumstances involving the state legislative maps, Republican leaders accepted the inevitable, didn\u2019t appeal the decision, and quickly hammered out a new and less partisan set of districts. It\u2019s a good guess they will do the same with the congressional maps now.\n\nThe bottom line is that the big victory Republicans thought they\u2019d won last summer when SCOTUS refused to do anything about North Carolina\u2019s (and Maryland\u2019s) partisan gerrymandering was Pyrrhic. State courts around the country now have two models (this one and Pennsylvania\u2019s in 2018) for using equality protections frequently appearing in state constitutions to stop partisan gerrymandering. And precisely because SCOTUS has pushed federal courts out of the whole business of dealing with this problem, some eager would-be gerrymanderers must now deal with possible state-constitutional limitations just before the next decennial round of redistricting begins in 2021.\n\nThe big picture is this: A Republican Party that has come to rely heavily on gerrymandering and other anti-democratic institutional shortcuts to enhance its power can no longer necessarily count on justifying race-conscious map-drawing by claiming it\u2019s really just normal partisan politics. But the extent to which they will face new limits will depend on a lot of litigation in a lot of states. It\u2019s significant that the current North Carolina case is part of a national effort to fight GOP gerrymandering:\n\nThe plaintiffs, North Carolina residents, were sponsored by the National Redistricting Foundation, an arm of a Democratic group led by former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. that is seeking to challenge Republican control of the next round of redistricting in 2021.\n\nSo more lawsuits will soon be in the pipeline. And in the meantime, Democratic prospects for hanging on to control of the U.S. House in 2020 may have just gotten a bit easier.", "description": "Last summer the U.S. Supreme Court told federal courts to stop regulating partisan gerrymandering.
