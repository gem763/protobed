I started going to the gym and would walk on the treadmill for 2km and excitedly call him. One day, I forgot the gym was shut and I went for a run anyway. I did 4km and was jumping with joy. He was so supportive. Then I did 21km and won! My first 42km was in Athens, my first full marathon. By the 39th kilometre, there were literally tears of joy.
