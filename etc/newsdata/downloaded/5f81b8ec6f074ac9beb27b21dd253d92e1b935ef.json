I only saw this through Chris Moukarbel\u2019s documentary and I didn\u2019t think I would enjoy it as much as I did. It was so much about the way people reacted to the art that was so fascinating: the guys who disassembled the brick sphinx and rebuilt it in their garage to sell on; the Banksy originals being sold in the market at the side of Central Park for a few dollars; and the locals charging money for photographs of the Banksy picture in their neighbourhood. It was a very accessible, broad look at how art affects us. I really enjoyed it.\n\nYayoi Kusama: Aftermath of Obliteration of Eternity (2009)\n\n\u2018An indelible stamp\u2019: SimonLegend\n\nIt qualifies as an indelible stamp upon a world that unfolds continually into a not so distant, but nonetheless certain, oblivion.\n\n\u2018I was completely overwhelmed\u2019: Lewis, 28, Bristol\n\nThe Coral Reef was one of the most affecting pieces of art I\u2019ve experienced. I found it completely by accident through a door I felt didn\u2019t belong there. From that point I was completely overwhelmed, passing through a series of rooms that were nondescript but oppressive. It was so disorienting that I couldn\u2019t find the way out, and for the most part I was completely alone so couldn\u2019t ask for help. The Coral Reef is a series of offices, waiting rooms and corridors that are grubby and used but feel unspecific and indistinct. For me it represents the mundane spaces that we inhabit every day; the off-licence, the open-plan office, the hotel corridor. They exist out of context with the place they\u2019re in and result in an uncanny feeling of loss of control. It was unsettling and bizarre. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It\u2019s the most beautiful art object I\u2019ve experienced in my life.\u2019 A still from Ragnar Kjartansson\u2019s The Visitors, 2012, which was our No 1. Photograph: Elisabet Davidsdottir\n\nOlafur Eliasson: The Weather Project (2003)\n\n\u2018Awesome\u2019: BenCaute\n\nSo glad I got to see The Weather Project when it opened. It was, in the old-fashioned sense of the word, awesome. What the little spiel doesn\u2019t mention is the use of mist and vapour to soften the air \u2013 you can see the general effect in the picture.\n\nFlop Lefebvre: Heureuses Lueurs (2005)\n\n\u2018Best art exhibition I\u2019ve seen for a long time\u2019: Alarming\n\nThis is the best art exhibition I\u2019ve seen for a long time. Lefebvre uses light projection, bits of wire, small mirrors, book illustrations, coloured gels, small motors and mundane objects, which are projected through lenses on to a wall in a darkened room. The contrast between the beautiful projected image of his coffee pot bubbling away on a flame and the way he has created it is wonderful.\n\nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re looking at a coffee pot for the first time \u2013 a bit like when painters in the middle ages first started using modelling, realistic light and shadow and naturalistic landscape. He doesn\u2019t work on the art gallery circuit (you\u2019ll find him in puppet/animation festivals, theatres or with a French performance company Groupe ZUR), he hasn\u2019t, as far as I know, worked in the UK so his work bypasses the critics.\n\nThe best art of the 21st century Read more\n\nRoni Horn \u2013 Pink Tons (2009)\n\n\u2018Absolutely mesmerising\u2019: Crawford_Montazano\n\nLooks like a big chunk of Turkish Delight, but is in fact 4.5 tons of solid cast glass. It\u2019s absolutely mesmerising.\n\nRagnar Kjartansson: The Visitors (2012)\n\n\u2018The most beautiful art object I\u2019ve experienced\u2019: fromtherooftops\n\nAgree with Kjartansson\u2019s The Visitors as No 1. It was shown here in Cardiff at the Artes Mundi festival a few years ago, in the tiny Turner Gallery in Penarth. I went back five times, various friends in tow, to try to drink in all the screens (it was set up 360 degrees, so you couldn\u2019t see it all at once). As it was shown on a continuous loop of 64 minutes, it slipped further out of kilter as the day wore on. We\u2019d listen downstairs for the aural signals of when to enter the \u201ccycle\u201d, so we\u2019d catch the end of one and then get through a full one. It\u2019s the most beautiful art object I\u2019ve experienced in my life.\n\n", "description": "After we published our chart of the best art since 2000, you sent in your thoughts and suggestions, from price-slash Banksys to Yayoi Kusama\u2019s oblivion", "authors": ["Guardian Readers"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/968dd8f5b4e6ad2bc690bfad9705113500b2eeca/0_138_3407_2044/master/3407.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=841ac67f6bb0cf9806808268b0561e87", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
