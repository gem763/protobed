Unlike past presidents, he has retained ownership of numerous business interests, including the hotel, while serving as president.\n\nSince his election, the hotel has become a favored lodging and event space for some foreign and state officials visiting the U.S. capital.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that, in failing to disengage from the hotel, Trump has made himself vulnerable to inducements by foreign governments seeking to curry favor, violating the Constitution.\n\nMaryland-based U.S. District Judge Peter Messitte, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, last year allowed the lawsuit to proceed, a ruling Trump appealed to the 4th Circuit.\n\nAll three of the judges who heard the initial appeal and sided with Trump were appointed by Republican presidents.\n\nTrump faces two other pending lawsuits making similar claims. One case was brought by a group of more than 200 Democratic Party lawmakers, while the other was brought by Washington-based advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics.\n\n(Reporting by Jan Wolfe; Editing by Bill Berkrot)", "description": "(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday said it would reconsider an earlier ruling that handed victory to U.S. President Donald Trump in a Democratic-backed lawsuit that accuses him of violating anti-corruption provisions of the U.S. Constitution with his Washington hotel.", "authors": ["Jan"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
