This meant a more senior nurse or doctor was not alerted to Mrs Bailey\u2019s condition.\n\nChristine, a human resources consultant, said: \u2018Bringing the case was never about money. Absolutely nothing could make up for losing my mum'\n\nAlthough blood tests were done, they were wrongly assessed as being normal and the mother of two \u2013 who worked as a catering assistant in the hospital canteen \u2013 was misdiagnosed as having a virus and sent home with paracetamol.\n\nMrs Bailey deteriorated overnight and she was admitted by ambulance about 18 hours later.\n\nDoctors battled to stabilise her condition, treating it with antibiotics, but the Jamaican-born divorcee died in intensive care on October 22, 2013. A serious incident investigation by the hospital revealed the A&E unit had been very busy when Mrs Bailey first arrived.\n\nIts observation ward was full of patients and it was struggling to cope because of staff shortages \u2013 three nurses and one doctor were absent.\n\nThe inquiry concluded that, had she been given oral antibiotics, the outcome may have been different.\n\nHer family decided to take legal action years later after watching a television news report about another sepsis death at the same hospital. Yesterday, it emerged that the hospital had agreed to pay a five-figure compensation settlement to Mrs Bailey\u2019s family after bosses admitted negligence.\n\nThe Jamaican-born divorcee died in intensive care on October 22, 2013. A serious incident investigation by the hospital revealed the A&E unit had been very busy when Mrs Bailey first arrived\n\nBut her daughter, Christine Hamilton, 52, a human resources consultant, said: \u2018Bringing the case was never about money. Absolutely nothing could make up for losing my mum.\n\n\u2018I needed to do something to try to stop any more families suffering as we have \u2013 to protect patients from appalling errors and to ensure this cannot happen again. I truly hope Lewisham Hospital have learnt from their dreadful mistakes and I will continue to raise awareness of the terrible impact that sepsis \u2013 and the delay in diagnosing it \u2013 can have on lives and families.\u2019 She added: \u2018The impact of my mother\u2019s death has been completely devastating. We were extremely close and everyone in the family loved her.\n\n\u2018My mother really believed in Lewisham Hospital. My brother Roger and I were born there. She had worked at the hospital for 25 years and everyone liked her.\u2019\n\nClaire Boardman, of JMW solicitors, who acted for the family, said: \u2018Lovetta was treated appallingly by hospital staff and her family will live with the consequences of this for the rest of their lives.\n\n\u2018It is vital that more is done by hospitals to ensure staff are aware of the signs of sepsis and patients receive the urgent treatment they require.\u2019\n\nThe Daily Mail has been campaigning to raise awareness of sepsis symptoms among patients and staff since January 2016.\n\nA spokesman for Lewisham Hospital accepted there were \u2018failings\u2019 in the care Mrs Bailey received and apologised to her family. He added: \u2018Several changes have been made to processes in the emergency department to prevent a similar incident occurring again.\u2019", "description": "Lovetta Bailey, 63, died in intensive care on October 22, 2013, at Lewisham Hospital in south-east London.
