But one man who was there to witness it all was Freddie\u2019s personal assistant, Peter \u2018Phoebe\u2019 Freestone.\n\nPeter worked for Queen and Freddie for 12 years, right up until the musician\u2019s death in 1991.\n\nAccording to the former PA, hanging out with two of the biggest superstars in the world didn\u2019t feel out of the ordinary.\n\nPeter told Metro.co.uk: \u2018You accept people how they are. For example, with Michael Jackson, Freddie and I went to his house to record for eight hours one day. This was back in 1983, and Freddie and Michael collaborated on three different tracks at that point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But Michael didn\u2019t treat me any differently than he treated Freddie. It was just the way people are. Michael and I played video games for half an hour while Freddie was outside smoking.\u2019\n\nFreddie\u2019s former PA had first-hand access to the Jackson recording sessions (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Peter, Michael later took him and Freddie on a tour of the house, situated on Encino\u2019s Hayvenhurst Avenue. When they got upstairs, Freddie couldn\u2019t believe his eyes when he saw a mattress on the middle of the floor of the king of pop\u2019s million-dollar mansion.\n\n\u2018Freddie just could not keep his mouth shut because right in the middle of the floor, was this big mattress made up as a bed,\u2019 Peter recalled.\n\n\u2018Freddie said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got money why don\u2019t you buy a bed?\u201d And Michael just said, \u201cI feel so much better when I\u2019m closer to the Earth\u201d. Freddie said, \u201cWell how much closer does not having a bed make you? We\u2019re upstairs\u201d.\u2019\n\nPeter added: \u2018That was the sort of thing that happened.\u2019\n\nNot many are privy to the inner workings of two music icons in the studio, and it\u2019s an experience Peter is able to recall in minute detail, even after all these years.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s actually amazing to see two amazing talents working off each other,\u2019 he revealed. \u2018Basically Michael had a track ready, which was called State of Shock, which he wanted Freddie to put his voice on, so he did.\u2019\n\nJackson recorded three songs with Freddie (Picture: WireImage)\n\n\u2018Then they worked on a track of Freddie\u2019s, which was There Must Be More To Life Than This, that he was working on for a Queen album.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But the thing is, there was hardly any words or anything. So a lot of the time Michael was ad-libbing putting his own words in. In fact, there was a third track. The combination of the two of them, but just being there while they were actually, they were feeding off each other.\u2019\n\nPeter continued: \u2018Each of them were just giving out everything they could to create something and to be present at that sort of thing is amazing. The same the same happened with David Bowie with Under Pressure for Queen.\n\n\u2018To be present when you have\u2026 it\u2019s almost like electricity. Then you feel tension in the air and there\u2019s that o-zone smell. It\u2019s almost like that.\u2019\n\nFans are able to enjoy Freddie\u2019s music with fresh insight thanks to the release of the Never Boring box set, which features a specially-curated selection of the singer\u2019s music, visuals and written and spoken words.\n\nIt includes three CDs with 32 tracks, a Blu-ray and DVD featuring 13 promo videos and an interview, a 120-page 10\u201dx10\u201d hardback book full of photos, and an introduction from Rami Malek himself.\n\nEarlier in October, the previously-banned music video for Freddie\u2019s song Living On My Own, was released for the first time completely remastered.\n\nThe visuals were shot at Freddie\u2019s 39th birthday party and basically, it was a raucous affair.\n\nRecalling the night it was shot, Peter said: \u2018The party was always meant to be filmed. It was going to be part of this video. So they set up a camera on a track going all around the room and everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018People knew it was going to be filmed.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018The thing is, it still didn\u2019t stop all the alcohol flowing.\n\n\u2018It really did get quite crazy at the end. I mean, I can remember more about staggering home at four o\u2019clock in the morning, than the three or four hours before that. It was a nonstop round of dancing, drinking. It just became totally crazy.\u2019\n\nFreddie Mercury\u2019s Never Before box set is available to buy now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
