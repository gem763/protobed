To use what is perhaps the lowest point of Trump\u2019s vulgarities, the left has not yet learned how to grab him by the pussy.\n\nTrump is not winning just by shamelessly bombarding us with messages which generate obscene enjoyment at how he dares to violate the elementary norms of decency. Through all his shocking vulgarities, he is providing his followers with a narrative which makes sense \u2013 a very limited and twisted sense, but nonetheless a sense which obviously does a better job than the left-liberal narrative. His shameless obscenities serve as signs of solidarity with so-called ordinary people (\u2018you see, I am the same as you, we are all red under our skin\u2019), and this solidarity also signals the point at which Trump\u2019s obscenity reaches its limit. Trump is not totally obscene: when he talks about the greatness of America, when he dismisses his opponents as enemies of the people, et cetera, he intends to be taken seriously, and his obscenities are meant to precisely emphasize by contrast the level at which he is serious: they are meant to function as an obscene display of his belief in the greatness of America.", "description": "", "authors": ["Slavoj \u017di\u017eek", "Spectator.Us Trump-Re-Elected-Left-Liberal-Stupidity"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
