It hit as low as $1.2850 in Asian trading before settling around $1.2920 in London, down 0.5% on the day.\n\nGoldman Sachs raised the probability of the United Kingdom leaving with a ratified deal to 70% from 65%, cut its view of the chances of a \"no-deal\" Brexit to 5% from 10% and left its view on no Brexit at all unchanged at 25%.\n\n\n\n\n\nBREXIT DELAY?\n\nThe EU, which has grappled with the tortuous Brexit crisis since Britons voted 52%-48% to leave in a 2016 referendum, was clearly bewildered by the contradictory signals from London.\n\nWith Brexit up in the air, the bloc's ambassadors decided on Sunday to play for time rather than rush to decide on Johnson's request.\n\nFrom the EU's point of view, extension options range from just an additional month until the end of November to half a year or longer.\n\n\"We're looking for more clarity towards the end of the week, hoping that by that time we will also see how things develop in London,\" one senior EU diplomat said.\n\nIt was unlikely that the EU's 27 remaining member states would refuse Britain's request to delay once again its departure, given the impact on all parties of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIn London, Johnson's ministers said they were confident they had the numbers to push a deal through parliament where opponents were plotting to derail the deal he had assured the EU that he could ratify.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party was planning changes to the deal that would make it unacceptable to swathes of Johnson's own party including a proposals for another referendum.\n\nJohnson's former allies, the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have indicated they could back a proposal for a customs union with the EU - a step that, if passed, would doom Johnson's deal, The Daily Telegraph reported.\n\n\"Foolish or mendacious members of parliament have continually moved the goalposts and taken away the compression of a deadline,\" hardline Brexit supporter Steve Baker said.\n\nIf Johnson's deal is wrecked just days before the United Kingdom's planned departure, it would leave Johnson a choice: leave without a deal or accept a delay.
