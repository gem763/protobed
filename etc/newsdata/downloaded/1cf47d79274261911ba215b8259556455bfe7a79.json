Still, he offered nothing but scorn for the few remaining Never Trump Republicans, whom he accused of being self-righteous and politically shortsighted. \u201cFor a lot of the purists, they would rather go down in flames than look at any political equation,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the people who supported George W. Bush when he did nothing for conservatives, and they don\u2019t have any leg to stand on when it comes to passing judgment on Trump.\u201d\n\nMr. Bozell has also discovered that there is a significant market for defending Mr. Trump against impeachment . Through the organization he founded, the Media Research Center, he has helped provide the Trump-friendly news media with a steady stream of videos and articles alleging bias in the mainstream news media\u2019s coverage of impeachment. He has also co-written a book this year on a similar theme: \u201cUnmasked: Big Media\u2019s War Against Trump.\u201d\n\nIn the Republican national security community, many still openly criticize Mr. Trump. But some of the most prominent signatories of the 2016 letter have taken a more charitable view of the president today, like Tom Ridge, the former Homeland Security secretary, and John Negroponte, the former director of national intelligence, who said earlier this year: \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think his presidency has been catastrophic.\u201d\n\nAnd at least one of those officials who signed the letter, James Jeffrey, now works for the Trump administration. He has a high-profile posting in the State Department as the special representative dealing with Syria.\n\nThe motivations for getting on board are considerable: a job, a bigger audience, a white knight-like belief that you can change things from the inside. \u201cSome of this is pure opportunism and careerism,\u201d said Eliot A. Cohen, a State Department official in the second Bush administration who signed the letter and also helped recruit like-minded Republicans to join an earlier anti-Trump letter that called the then-candidate \u201cfundamentally dishonest.\u201d", "description": "They signed open letters, dedicated a special magazine issue to criticism of him and swore he would tear at the fabric of this nation. Now they have become the president\u2019s strongest defenders.", "authors": ["Jeremy W.
