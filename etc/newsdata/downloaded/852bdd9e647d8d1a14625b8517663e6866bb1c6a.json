As they're one of the hosts of the next Euros, it's a great chance for us to experience playing there, as we work hard to qualify for the tournament.\n\n'Austria sit on top of the qualifying group alongside us and they're a good, well-organised team and an emerging nation, so hopefully it will be an entertaining and competitive game for our supporters watching in Milton Keynes.'", "description": "The pair both missed out on the last squad through injury, but have been named among the 23-strong group for games against Slovenia and Austria later this month.", "authors": ["Ben Nagle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/10/19291662-0-image-a-82_1570183099012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
