My favourite indie game is Mark Of The Ninja by Klei, originally on the Xbox 360, but as I have talked about that one before on the Inbox I will talk about some others. I really enjoyed The Sexy Brutale as it was very clever and it reminded me of a game I enjoyed on the PlayStation 2 called Gregory Horror Show. The Sexy Brutale had a very good story and ending and I enjoyed it so much that I got the Platinum for it, which I don\u2019t do for many games.\n\nI have also thoroughly enjoyed the Inside and Limbo games by Playdead and am looking forward to their next game as their games are so well polished and they keep you hooked on what is going to happen next to your character and what you are going to discover about the story and world the game is set in.\n\nOther games I have enjoyed are Celeste (brilliant and rewarding platformer), Steamworld Dig 1 and 2 (excellent games that you could think have been made by Nintendo but are not), Yoku\u2019s Island Express (brilliant pinball Metroidvania), Axiom Verge (amazing visuals and not as hard to complete as it looks because I have completed it and I am no gaming ninja), Forgotton Anne (very immersive Studio Ghibli style game), What Remains Of Edith Finch (fantastic story), Firewatch (very good walking simulator but the ending wasn\u2019t so great), Severed (played on PS Vita, highly recommended), King\u2019s Quest (on PlayStation 4, not sure if this is classed as an indie game or not but it was very good graphic adventure), Virginia (The X-Files style mystery drama), Everybody\u2019s Gone To The Rapture (very atmospheric walking simulator but not for everyone as some people may find it slow and boring, I didn\u2019t), Guacamelee! (fun but hard Metroidvania, got the sequel waiting to be played on my PlayStation 4), Valiant Hearts (nice story and interesting game with facts about World War I), Stick It To The Man (really good game that is very similar to Double Fine\u2019s games), Stealth Inc. (polite name of the original name), Thomas Was Alone (one of the first Indie games I played and by the creator of John Wick Hex), Costume Quest (really fun and short role-playing game set during trick or treat), Pony Island (not for everyone, but I enjoyed it), Gorogoa (amazing puzzles and artwork), Gone Home (one of the first indie games I played and enjoyed for the story), The Vanishing If Ethan Carter (really atmospheric and amazing visuals for an indie game) and Dear Esther\n\n(played recently in the past two years, very good but quite complicated story).\n\nI usually get indie games day one if they have reviewed well or wait for a price cut, so when games get given away with Games with Gold I have already bought and played them but that doesn\u2019t bother me as it gives some great games more exposure as some of my friends don\u2019t even touch indie games and only play the big physical releases. Which I like to play too.\n\nAndrew J.\n\nGC: King\u2019s Quest was published on Activision\u2019s short-lived indie label, so it sort of counts.", "description": "GameCentral readers name their favourite ever indie games, from Hotline Miami to Ori And The Blind Forest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/voidheart-84cc_1570231879.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
