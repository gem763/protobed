It usually doesn\u2019t require a second thought, just a half-wish whispered into the ether, echoed by kindred spirits through retweets and affirmative replies. Non-famouses and celebs alike send these tweets with nary a second thought. But, what if one of these horny tweets magically came true? That seems to be the case for Halsey, who was recently seen on what appeared to be a date with Evan Peters, the same guy she thirstily tweeted about seven years ago.\n\nAs the Daily Mail reports, Halsey and Peters were spotted \u201cgetting cozy\u201d at Six Flags Magic Mountain in LA, because there\u2019s nothing quite like \u201ccanoodling\u201d with your longtime crush on a rollercoaster. \u201cThey were smiling and laughing together and looking into each other\u2019s eyes as they were waiting for the ride to start,\u201d a source told the Daily Mail.\n\nStarting in 2012, Halsey tweeted about her attraction to Peters, then mostly known for his work in American Horror Story. Some of the tweets over the years included, \u201cSeriously Evan Peters stop making me attracted to alleged sociopaths and accused murderers\u2026.\u201d (probably referencing his character Tate, the teen killer, in American Horror Story: Murder House), and, \u201cI\u2019m a fucking liar I\u2019m so in love with Evan Peters I\u2019m so whipped I\u2019m whipped as fuck!\u201d, as well as, \u201cI just want cookies and Evan Peters,\u201d and finally, the spell she hath cast to success: \u201cPetition for Evan Peters to Date Me.\u201d\n\nPeters was with his AHS co-star, Emma Roberts, for seven years, before breaking up earlier this year, while Halsey dated rapper G-Eazy, and most recently, the singer Yungblud. Now, she\u2019s with the object of her horny tweeting affection. Halsey, your powers are strong. Get it, girl. May this be a lesson to us all!\n\nStay in touch.
