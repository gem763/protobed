With the passage of the first fiscal year 2020 \u201cminibus\u201d appropriations package, their fiscally reckless agenda became clear.\n\nThe massive $1 trillion spending bill passed today busts the Budget Control Act spending caps, ignores the mounting national debt crisis, and directs increased funding to inefficient, wasteful programs that the federal government has no business in.\n\nThankfully, the Senate is yet to pass a budget or begin debating spending bills. The Senate should adopt a budget resolution holding to the total Budget Control Act cap for 2020. It should then work with the House to develop appropriations bills prioritizing constitutional responsibilities, such as national defense, without increasing deficit spending.\n\nThe appropriations process is an opportunity for Congress to take steps toward restoring fiscal sanity. If lawmakers don\u2019t get serious now, every American will pay a heavy price.", "description": "Washington, D.C. \u2014\u00a0\u00a0Justin Bogie, Heritage Foundation senior policy analyst in fiscal affairs released the following response after the House passed its first fiscal year 2020 spending bill:", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
