A computer and electronic products manager told the institute that \u201ctariffs continue to be a strain on the supply chain and the economy over all.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s tariffs have affected many factory owners who depend on overseas suppliers for components and raw materials. And with Beijing imposing retaliatory tariffs on American goods, many manufacturers reliant on sales to China are feeling pain as well. All of this makes manufacturers more vulnerable to trade tensions than service-economy companies.\n\nAt RJM Music in Vista, Calif., tariffs on LCD screens from China have increased the cost of that component by 25 percent, prompting a co-owner, Sheri Menelli, to rethink growth plans. Her company makes foot pedals and controllers that help guitarists integrate effects while they play, gear that it sells to rock stars and ordinary musicians.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been eating it for the last two months,\u201d Ms. Menelli said. \u201cWe are trying to pass it on, but you end up reducing volume.\u201d\n\nBuying screens from another country isn\u2019t an option. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at every other LCD, but the ones we need come from China,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Menelli\u2019s company has three full-time employees and two part-timers. She had planned to hire a third part-time employee but has decided to hold off for now.\n\n\u201cWe keep hearing on TV that China is paying for the tariffs,\u201d she said, referring to a statement President Trump has made frequently. \u201cI can tell you that right now I\u2019m paying for the tariffs.\u201d", "description": "A key index fell to its lowest level since January 2016 as production managers said President Trump\u2019s trade war with China was straining supply chains.", "authors": ["Nelson D.
