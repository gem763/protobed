In Seattle, Microsoft and Amazon have announced initiatives. In the Bay Area, Google announced a $1 billion ten-year-plan just a few months ago, and now Facebook is doing the same.\n\nIn a blog post attributed to Facebook CFO David Wehner, the company announced that they\u2019ve set aside $1 billion to tackle affordable housing, and that they\u2019re hoping this initiative will lead to the creation of \u201cup to 20,000 new housing units.\u201d\n\nThis\u2013of course\u2013isn\u2019t going to be some lump sum check sent to the California government, it\u2019s divvied up into a few different initiatives\n\nCalifornia state: $250 million is being devoted to a partnership with the California state government to subsidize development on excess state-owned land \u201cwhere housing is scarce.\u201d\n\n$250 million is being devoted to a partnership with the California state government to subsidize development on excess state-owned land \u201cwhere housing is scarce.\u201d Bay Area: A $225 million chunk of the commitment is the value of Facebook-owned land that has been zoned for housing in Menlo Park.
