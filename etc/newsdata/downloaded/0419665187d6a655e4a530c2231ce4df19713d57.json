When I came out to New York, I was fresh from three years of reporting on Brexit: I\u2019d stood in the newsroom and watched the EU referendum results come out, and then, not long after, I\u2019d battled through the rain at 4am to get to the office and deal with the aftermath of the 2016 US election. To me, both seemed equally cataclysmic \u2014 but Brexit was painful on a personal level. I was glad to touch down on US soil and throw myself into covering the politics of the upcoming 2020 election and the Democratic debates; it felt like a reprieve.\n\nOver the last nine months that I\u2019ve been resident in the US, my home country has undergone huge political turmoil which I\u2019ve mostly learnt about through a barrage of panicked messages from friends and family at antisocial hours. When Boris Johnson became prime minister, I felt it like a dull thud. I remembered watching the shenanigans between him and Michael Gove play out a couple of years before and wondering whether it would all work out for him. The fact that it did, against all odds \u2014 and the fact that I cared, while US television rolled on, oblivious, and New Yorkers admitted they weren\u2019t sure who the British PM was half the time anyway \u2014 made the rolling news on my phone\u2019s BBC app feel like a niche political drama where I was one of its only ardent followers.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSo it was this week when the UK\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen to prorogue parliament for five weeks before the Brexit deadline was unlawful. Speaking to my UK colleagues, it was clear they took the news very seriously (right down to the type of brooch the ruling judge was wearing.) But few of my US friends had any idea what had happened. The news was buried in the middle of the broadsheet papers, and didn\u2019t warrant discussion on the breakfast shows. \u201cDoes this mean Brexit isn\u2019t happening?\u201d a couple of people asked me; then, when I said no, they shrugged and said, \u201cGet back to me when a real development happens.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s brutal, but it\u2019s an assessment of the situation I share. The ruling was big news for a small island, but it didn\u2019t have any international significance. Brexit, with its potential for global trade upheaval and its effects on the UK\u2019s currency, is interesting to North Americans (though being told to \u201cquickly summarize the situation\u201d over a beer with a couple of interested Canadians in Toronto left me a little blind-sided. When you\u2019ve covered the ins and outs of the thing for three years, how are you supposed to answer?) A ruling on the proroguing of parliament just isn\u2019t the same.\n\nHere in the US, as the UK Supreme Court ruling came through, we were working to respond to allegations against Donald Trump that he had effectively offered the Ukrainian president foreign aid in exchange for digging dirt up on the son of Trump\u2019s likely rival in 2020, Joe Biden. Later in the day, Nancy Pelosi announced that she was beginning impeachment procedures on behalf of the Democrats. Previously, moderate Dems \u2014 Pelosi included \u2014 have refused to utter the \"i word\", worrying that it might accrue them bad political karma for the next election. But how else can you respond when a whistleblower within the world\u2019s most respected intelligence service has expressed grave concerns about the leader of the country? In this kind of a news agenda, few people are worried about whether MPs will sit in the House of Commons in London and discuss Brexit with each other for a few extra weeks.\n\nLike me, Boris Johnson is currently in New York, currently attending the United Nations\u2019 General Assembly before flying back early to face urgent questions in parliament. He met with Trump on Tuesday morning, and I watched their joint press conference with interest. Trump referred to his British counterpart as \u201cmy friend Boris\u201d four times in seven minutes, and he made his usual bombastic remarks about \u201cquadrupling our trade\u201d and doing deals. It was clear that Boris, however, wanted to differentiate himself from the American president at a time when he\u2019s no doubt been advised to keep an eye on his personal PR. \u201cWe must always remember that the NHS is not for sale,\u201d he cut in, when Trump mentioned trade representatives from each country preparing for \u201clots of meetings\u201d. Each time The Donald referred to him as a personal friend, he smiled uncomfortably and awkwardly repositioned himself on his seat.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Although he said he \u201cdisagrees profoundly\u201d with what Lady Hale had to say, the first words out of his mouth were: \u201cWe respect the judiciary in our country\u201d and when Trump, in his buddy-buddy manner, said to Boris that he\u2019d had trouble with his own Supreme Court in the end but ultimately \u201cwon out, got the wall\u201d and managed to push through his own agenda \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s gonna happen for you,\u201d he added \u2014 Boris blustered about \u201cnot counting our chickens\u201d before getting back on message with: \u201cWe\u2019re going to respect the court\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, when Trump took offense to the resignation question on Johnson\u2019s behalf and said, \u201cThat was a very nasty question from an American reporter,\u201d Boris responded, \u201cI think he was asking a question, to be fair, that a lot of British reporters would have asked.\u201d It was clear that he was being mindful not to insult the US president, but also to differentiate himself from him publicly: he can\u2019t afford, at this moment in time, to join the anti-free press \u201cfake news\u201d circus or to be referred to any longer as \u201cthe British Trump\u201d. Next to the US president, who batted off a question about Ukraine as if it didn\u2019t matter, I hate to say it but Boris Johnson looked like a proper leader.\n\nThere was one moment when Trump did speak for the whole of his country, though. When asked how he reacted when he heard of the UK Supreme Court ruling, he shrugged and replied: \u201cI had no reaction.\u201d He then followed up with: \u201cI asked Boris, and he said it\u2019s just another day in the office.\u201d After months of seemingly endless twists and turns in the Brexit story, even something as seemingly dramatic as Supreme Court involvement is unlikely to get much reaction from any other American, either. This kind of chaos is what other countries now think of as business as usual for Britain. What that means for our future is a subject for another column entirely.", "description": "There\u2019s nothing like moving to America to make you realise how little your small, European country\u2019s politics matter.
