Maybe teams got better, or worse, but mostly the moves made sense.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Houston Texans, who seemed to be unanimously ruled a loser of a hectic Saturday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch NFL games on your phone for FREE with the Yahoo Sports app.]\n\nThe Texans have famously gone without a general manager since Brian Gaine was suddenly fired, and maybe that was a mistake. The feeling is that coach Bill O\u2019Brien is the main decision maker, though there is officially a committee operating as the Texans\u2019 GM.\n\nAnd they made moves that puzzled the NFL on Saturday.\n\nHouston Texans head coach Bill O'Brien and his team made many big moves Saturday. (AP)\n\nTexans made a flurry of moves\n\nWhere to start? The biggest move on Saturday might have been the Jadeveon Clowney trade to Seattle. There was a report that Clowney would have signed his franchise tag tender, but then found out the Texans were shopping him in a trade. After Houston botched that, and Clowney didn\u2019t like his visit to Miami, the Texans seemed to panic.\n\nClowney was scooped up from Seattle for a third-round pick, and edge defenders Barkevious Mingo and Jacob Martin, neither of whom are impact players. Even if Clowney plays one year for Seattle and leaves, the compensatory pick they\u2019ll get should match the third-round pick they gave up. Houston got very little in return for one of their superstars.\n\nIf Clowney wasn\u2019t the biggest move in the NFL on Saturday, it was the crazy trade with the Dolphins later in the afternoon.\n\nHouston at least got a left tackle\n\nStory continues\n\nHouston getting left tackle Laremy Tunsil from the Dolphins isn\u2019t bad. He\u2019s a good, young player and Deshaun Watson needs some protection. Receiver Kenny Stills seems a bit redundant with Will Fuller and Keke Coutee on the roster. And for Tunsil and Stills, the Texans gave up ... two first-round picks and a second-round pick. That\u2019s massive. Houston also got a fourth-round pick back, and the Dolphins got special teamer Johnson Bademosi and offensive tackle Julie\u2019n Davenport, per NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport.\n\nTo top things off the Texans traded offensive lineman Martinas Rankin for running back Carlos Hyde, who slid quickly down the depth chart in Kansas City and is now on his fifth team in less than two years. The Texans needed a running back after losing Pro Bowler Lamar Miller to a torn ACL in the third preseason game, though they had Duke Johnson (for whom they traded a fourth-round pick that can become a third) and Hyde is no sure thing. On Saturday, Houston also sent a sixth-round pick to the Patriots for cornerback Keion Crossen according to ESPN\u2019s Field Yates.\n\nIf the Texans were going to ship off so many picks, why trade Clowney for so little? Was the Dolphins trade worth it considering Stills\u2019 role might be hard to pinpoint? Is Hyde really going to fix Houston\u2019s running game?\n\nO\u2019Brien has won apparent power struggles against multiple general managers, but he also might be feeling some heat himself. The road to the AFC South is wide open with Andrew Luck\u2019s retirement. But if Houston did improve at all Saturday for this season \u2014 and considering they lost Clowney, it\u2019s hard to argue that \u2014 it came at a heavy price for the future.\n\nO\u2019Brien and the Texans\u2019 committee at general manager better be right about their Saturday moves. Nobody else seems to know what they\u2019re doing.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
