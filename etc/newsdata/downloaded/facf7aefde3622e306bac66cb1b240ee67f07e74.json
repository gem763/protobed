When Watson responded that he worked in journalism, the official began repeatedly badgering him into \u201cadmitting\u201d that he writes propaganda, Watson wrote of his experience.\n\n\u201cSo you write propaganda, right?\u201d Watson recalled the official asking, a question posed at least four times before the passport officer returned Watson\u2019s passport and allowed him to enter the country.\n\nWatson, who covers national security and homeland security, eventually told the official that the closest he came to writing propaganda was during his time as a public affairs officer for the U.S. Army. The official was, apparently, unamused. Watson finally told the officer that he wrote propaganda, \u201cfor the purposes of expediting this conversation,\u201d before being asked the question one more time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve honestly never had a human attempt to provoke me like this before in my life,\u201d Watson told his colleagues after the incident. \u201cThis behavior is totally normal now, I guess?\u201d\n\nIn response to questions from The Daily Beast about the incident, a CBP spokesperson said that the agency is aware of Watson\u2019s allegations and is investigating the incident.\n\n\u201cWe hold our employees accountable to our core values of vigilance, integrity and service to country, and do not tolerate inappropriate comments or behavior by our employees,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that travelers have the right to ask to speak with a supervisor to address concerns they have.\n\nHarassment of non-citizen reporters on visas by USCBP officials calling them \u201cfake news\u201d has been a persistent issue within the agency. In February, BuzzFeed News reporter David Mack, an Australian citizen, received a personal apology from then-USCBP Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs Andrew Meehan, after Mack was interrogated at John F. Kennedy International Airport for ten minutes about the outlet\u2019s coverage of Michael Cohen and the special counsel investigation into President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe immigration agent at JFK just saw that I work for BuzzFeed and just grilled me for 10 minutes about the Cohen story, which was fun given he gets to decide whether to let me back into the country,\u201d Mack tweeted at the time. (Disclosure: Mack is a personal friend of this reporter.)\n\nBritish journalist James Dyer, who writes about pop culture, tweeted in August that he was harassed as \u201cfake news\u201d by a USCBP official upon arriving at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to know if I\u2019d ever worked for CNN or MSNBC or other outlets that are \u2018spreading lies to the American people,\u2019\u201d Dyer said at the time, adding that he was only let go \u201cafter I said that I was just here to write about Star Wars, and would keep the fake news about that to a bare minimum.\u201d\n\nAfter Watson shared his story on Friday, TIME Washington Correspondent Vera Bergengruen shared a similar story.\n\n\u201cThis has happened to me coming back into the country too, last year,\u201d Bergengruen said. \u201cA pretty aggressive questioning about who I worked for and \u2018fake news.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter Dyer\u2019s experience, a USCBP spokesperson told The Daily Beast that \u201cunappropriated comments or behavior are not tolerated, and do not reflect our values of vigilance, integrity and professionalism.\u201d\n\nAfter the incident with Mack in February, USCBP said that the officer\u2019s comments \u201cdo not reflect CBP\u2019s commitment to integrity and professionalism of its workforce,\u201d and vowed to immediately review the event.\n\n\u201cI hope\u2014I can only hope that you treat this incident as incidental,\u201d said Meehan. \u201cIt does not reflect the agency, and certainly not the professionalism that its officers strive to maintain.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
