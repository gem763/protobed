As indicated in a footnote, that\u2019s a reference to the U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that Russia carried out a vast cybercampaign in an effort to help elect Donald Trump.\n\nNow Facebook is facing an intensifying backlash over its handling of various elements of the 2016 campaign. The latest crisis came on Monday night, when the New York Times and other outlets reported that Alex Stamos, Facebook\u2019s chief information security officer, is set to leave the company by August. Stamos is widely respected within the cybersecurity community, but that\u2019s not the sole reason that his expected departure is such a blow. It\u2019s also exposed a debate among Facebook executives over how to address attempts to misuse the platform, and how much to disclose following security breaches.\n\nAccording to the Times, there\u2019s been ongoing tension within Facebook\u2019s upper ranks between the security team, which tended to push for more public disclosures on misuse by Russia and other nations, and the legal and policy teams, which prioritized protecting the company\u2019s business interests. Stamos was said to be a key advocate for publicizing Russia\u2019s interference and working to combat it, even before the election. Per the Times:\n\nMr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.\n\nBy November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook \u2026\n\nIn the ensuing months, Facebook\u2019s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.\n\nIn early 2017, Stamos penned a memo describing Russia\u2019s activities on the site, but direct references to Russia were reportedly scrubbed from the report, resulting in the vague aforementioned document published in April 2017.\n\nHowever, efforts to avoid publicly discussing Russia\u2019s activities didn\u2019t make the controversy go away. Months after media reports shed more light on Russia\u2019s use of fake ads and user accounts, in September 2017 the company said it had uncovered a vast Russian campaign to spread propaganda on the site:\n\nIn reviewing the ads buys, we have found approximately $100,000 in ad spending from June of 2015 to May of 2017 \u2014 associated with roughly 3,000 ads \u2014 that was connected to about 470 inauthentic accounts and Pages in violation of our policies. Our analysis suggests these accounts and Pages were affiliated with one another and likely operated out of Russia.\n\nIn a statement on Facebook Live at the time, Zuckerberg said the company was cooperating with investigators, and taking steps to make political advertising more transparent. When representatives from Facebook, as well as several other top tech companies, testified before Congress in the fall, lawmakers still criticized them for being slow to address the problem.\n\nStamos pushed back against reports of his imminent departure on Monday night, tweeting that while his role at the company has changed, \u201cI\u2019m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook.\u201d He also denied that fellow executives hampered his efforts to investigate Russian election meddling (though he did not say whether there was resistance to disclosing those findings).\n\nTo be clear, the security team has never been prevented or discouraged from investigating any Russian activity by any executives. https://t.co/At2KSn8oXE \u2014 Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) March 20, 2018\n\nEven if Stamos stays put, Facebook has plenty of other crises to deal with. Over the weekend Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica, which ran data operations for Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, ahead of media expos\u00e9s on how it harvested data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles. Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic working with Cambridge Analytica, allegedly violated Facebook\u2019s terms of use by saying the data would be used for academic purposes, not political purposes.\n\nAided by the Trump connection, the stories drew attention to Facebook\u2019s loose rules for accessing users\u2019 data. Kogan\u2019s initial collection was no different from what thousands of developers \u2014 from Farmville to Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign \u2014 have done legitimately. (The rules have been tightened since 2015, and allowing third-party apps to access your information no longer gives them access to all your friends\u2019 data as well.)\n\nNow lawmakers in the U.S. and Europe are calling for probes into how Facebook and other social-media companies protect users\u2019 data from third-party companies. Several members of Congress demanded that Zuckerberg testify on Capitol Hill about how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data.\n\n\u201cFacebook, Google, and Twitter have amassed unprecedented amounts of personal data and use this data when selling advertising, including political advertisements,\u201d Senators Amy Klobuchar and John Kennedy wrote in a letter to Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cThe lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights.\u201d\n\nGrassley\u2019s spokesperson said he has not decided whether to hold a hearing, but the controversies are already having an impact on Facebook. Its stock fell 6.8 percent on Monday, its worst single-day drop in four years. The company lost more than $36 billion in market value, and Zuckerberg personally lost $6.06 billion.\n\nFacebook can certainly survive the loss of a top security chief and another grilling from lawmakers, but it\u2019s a company built on trust. What happens if the ongoing revelations about Facebook\u2019s failure to protect users from Russian disinformation and the inappropriate use of their profile data make people less interested in handing over their personal information?", "description": "The reported exit of security chief Alex Stamos sheds light on Facebook\u2019s approach to the Cambridge Analytica and Russian-disinformation scandals.", "authors": ["Margaret Hartmann"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2018/03/18/20-stamos.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2018-03-20"}
