They\u2019ve not won there since Steve Watson knocked Roy Evans\u2019s side out of the League Cup in 1995; they\u2019ve not tasted league victory there since Andrew Cole and Robert Lee secured a 2-0 win in 1994. It\u2019s been mainly defeats ever since, though they did get a point three years ago against a starting XI featuring Alberto Moreno, Connor Randall and Kevin Stewart. The Magpies won\u2019t be flying down the A1 with too much hope in their hearts, then. Liverpool are on a 13-match Premier League winning run, and Mo Salah and Sadio Man\u00e9 have had their feet up during the international break. SM\n\n2) \u2026 but their manager may have a workable plan\n\nBut here\u2019s a sliver of historical hope for the Toon! Steve Bruce has masterminded six wins from 24 over Liverpool during his managerial career, not a bad return for a journeyman usually working with modest resources. His 25% success rate might not sound super-promising, but look at it this way: a one-in-four shout is a big improvement on the bookies\u2019 odds of 14-1. It\u2019s also exactly the same win ratio against the Reds achieved by a certain Rafa Ben\u00edtez, and nobody would be writing off one of his sides completely. Some straw-clutching? Perhaps \u2026 but then no one thought Bruce\u2019s Birmingham would win at Anfield in 2004 either, and look what happened there. SM\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Bruce: Anfield miracle worker? Photograph: Michael Mayhew/Sportsphoto/Allstar\n\n3) Attack remains best form of defence for Norwich\n\nManchester City\u2019s visit to Carrow Road has the potential to make England 5-3 Kosovo feel like a study in catenaccio and the odds on another thriller can only have shortened in light of the Canaries\u2019 injury woes. Christoph Zimmermann has joined Timm Klose on the sidelines while doubts over Grant Hanley\u2019s fitness, leave them worryingly thin at centre-back. Max Aarons, the outstanding right-back, also looks likely to miss out after injuring his ankle on England Under-21 duty and the only blessing might be that defending hardly seems Norwich\u2019s priority at the best of times. Matches such as Saturday\u2019s assume free-hit status for Daniel Farke\u2019s side and the expectation is that they will look to exploit any City weaknesses \u2013 occasionally suggested by Brighton a fortnight ago \u2013 by playing their usual front-footed game. The danger is that they risk the kind of hiding they took at Liverpool, and a team can only take so many if they are to retain their sparkle. Perhaps Farke might have looked to tighten things up given a clean bill of health; in the event Norwich probably have no choice but to pour forward again.

Hell, it\u2019s never too early for a relegation six-pointer. Both Brighton and Burnley flew out of the traps on the opening day with three-goal wins, but since then it\u2019s been a bit of a struggle. Six matches between them have produced two points and three goals. The Clarets can point to a few caveats: they fought hard at Arsenal, nearly ground out a win at Wolves, and nobody gets much from Liverpool right now. The Seagulls by comparison couldn\u2019t be expected to get anything at Manchester City, it\u2019s true, but a supine loss at home to a stuttering Southampton was more of a worry. This might not be a classic \u2013 three of the last four matches between these sides have ended 0-0, 0-0 and 1-0 \u2013 so remember to thank us for tempting fate when it ends 3-3. SM\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tom Davies is a regular for England\u2019s under-21 side, but is struggling for game time at Everton. Photograph: Eddie Keogh for The FA/Shutterstock\n\n5) Davies running out of chances at Everton?\n\nEverton splashed out more than \u00a3115m this summer, signing three midfielders \u2013 Andr\u00e9 Gomes, Jean-Philippe Gbamin and Fabian Delph \u2013 and while new faces have undoubtedly helped reinvigorate his squad, it has created something of a roadblock for Tom Davies. Since 7 February the Liverpudlian, who joined the club as an 11-year-old, has played more minutes for the England Under-21s than he has Everton. On the face of it, the \u00a330m sale of Idrissa Gueye to PSG seemed to play into Davies\u2019s hands while Gbamin, a \u00a325m recruit from Mainz, is expected to be out until November with a thigh injury. First-team chances have remained hard to come by, with Morgan Schneiderlin\u2019s renaissance pushing him further down the pecking order. Another home-grown midfielder, Kieran Dowell, and the full-back Jonjoe Kenny departed on loan in search of game time and perhaps Davies will soon have to follow suit. BF\n\n6) The Premier League crisis baton, part one\n\nIt\u2019s way too early for any club to be in full-blown crisis mode. But you know how folk are, and a couple of slow-starting big clubs might find themselves under pressure should things not go their way this weekend. Unbeaten Leicester City are everyone\u2019s tip to break up the Champions League cartel, and midfield maestro James Maddison has had a fortnight conserving his energy on England\u2019s bench. The Foxes haven\u2019t won at Old Trafford since Tony Cottee scored a first-half winner in 1998, and with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side currently partying like it\u2019s 1962, they might not have a better chance to end that barren run for a while. Should they frustrate the hosts, expect the wholly unreasonable noise around Manchester United \u2013 a team right at the start of a rebuild \u2013 to get a little louder. SM\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will be keen to avoid another defeat at Old Trafford, following the loss to Crystal Palace. Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images\n\n7) The Premier League crisis baton, part two\n\nOr perhaps it will be Tottenham who\u2019ll feel the full force of some confected crisis instead. Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s side are understandably suffering from a little post-Madrid hangover, the disappointment of coming so close in the Champions League still very real. They should have enough to see off Crystal Palace \u2013 they\u2019ve won their past six league meetings, and were excellent while going two up at Arsenal a fortnight ago. On the other hand, they let that lead against the Gunners slip, went down in their last home match to Newcastle, and Palace are flying after their confidence-boosting smash-and-grab at Old Trafford three weeks ago. Should Palace take the lead \u2013 and remember how Spurs struggled in the main after falling behind against Aston Villa \u2013 Spurs could get a little agitated. Should Palace frustrate the hosts, here comes some more of that wholly unreasonable noise! SM\n\n8) Welbeck gamble could give Flores a glorious return\n\nMeet the new boss, same as the old boss? Well, up to a point. Watford being Watford, only six of the players Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores managed in his previous spell are still on the scene so it may take time before he is fully reacquainted with the place he describes as \u201cmy home\u201d. It was no surprise Watford\u2019s owners blinked at the first sign of trouble for Javi Gracia and it would take some bravery to predict Flores\u2019s return lasting longer than his previous 11-and-a-half-month tenure. He has a tough job and, given Manchester City await after Arsenal, things may deteriorate before he can steady the ship. Even if he is not familiar with most of his new charges yet, one of them knows Sunday\u2019s opponents especially well. Danny Welbeck was eased back by Gracia, having missed most of last season. But 90 minutes in last month\u2019s League Cup win over Coventry boded well and a fortnight\u2019s training over the international break cannot have hurt. Giving Welbeck his first start might be the early masterstroke Flores needs; if one ex has come back to help Watford, another could boost their cause by downing his former employers.

This will be their first of the season and perhaps it is the occasion for a timely reset. Europa League football has brought a gruelling schedule that, while productive on the continental front, has contributed to a below-par start domestically. They remain winless but it is not all bad news: performance levels have been reasonable and, in Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, they have a striker who cannot stop scoring. He will fancy his chances against a leaky Chelsea, exactly the kind of opponents Wolves have their eyes on leapfrogging before long. When the sides met last December, Jim\u00e9nez was on target in a victory that kickstarted Wolves\u2019 season while highlighting the flaws that would stall Chelsea\u2019s campaign. They would overtake them with a win this time and add fuel to the idea that the London club\u2019s claim to a top-six spot looks distinctly vulnerable. It looks a big game for both sides\u2019 directions of travel and Wolves hope a lack of Thursday interruption will help them rediscover their old edge. NA\n\n10) Wilder\u2019s side must ignore ownership wrangle\n\nFour years ago, on the pitch at Meadow Lane after Northampton Town won at Notts County, an exhausted and exasperated Chris Wilder made his frustration known. Internal politics and a protracted takeover threatened to endanger Wilder\u2019s extraordinary work, with the team third in League Two despite staff having gone six weeks unpaid. \u201cIt\u2019s tearing us all apart,\u201d he said. The same cannot be said for the situation at Sheffield United but the dispute between the club\u2019s co-owners is hardly helpful, with a High Court verdict looming on Monday. Kevin McCabe and Prince Abdullah, a member of the Saudi royal family, have been at loggerheads for almost two years with the pair, who each have a 50% stake, pushing for outright control. On the pitch Southampton, who released Wilder as a teenager, are next up. \u201cWe had a blockage in the system, so many players at the time, he didn\u2019t make it,\u201d Dave Merrington, Wilder\u2019s former youth-team manager says. \u201cBut Chris was a good lad; he listened, applied himself. He was very switched on and I\u2019m just delighted to see him go on and do so well.\u201d BF", "description": "Steve Bruce might have what it takes at Anfield, Spurs and Manchester United under pressure and a relegation six-pointer at the Amex?", "authors": ["Scott Murray", "Nick Ames", "Ben Fisher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/274a658fd947ee4301e32f851467a9b37f8881b5/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ba837382a0d1a17c58d107412a7257f8"}
