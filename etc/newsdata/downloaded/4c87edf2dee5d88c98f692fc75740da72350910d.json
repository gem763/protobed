The Astros beat New York 4-1 on Tuesday to take a 2-1 series lead.\n\nThe winner will face Washington and its well-rested, talented rotation starting in the AL city on Tuesday night.\n\nWith New York relying so heavily on its relievers this month, the starter-driven Astros may be at an advantage.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to win this series, our bullpen will still play a huge role, obviously,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to be able to get a little bit of distance out of our starters.\u201d\n\nHouston will pitch Zack Greinke on Thursday against the Yankees\u2019 Masahiro Tanaka in a rematch of Game 1, both on regular rest. Tanaka pitched six sterling innings as New York won 7-0.\n\nThe Astros also announced that Justin Verlander will start Game 5 on full rest. He threw two-run ball into the seventh inning in a 3-2, 11-inning victory in Game 2 on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt was an easy decision,\u201d Astros manager AJ Hinch said.\n\nNew York plans to counter Verlander with James Paxton. The left-hander was pulled after allowing a run over 2 1/3 rocky innings in Game 2, and concerns were raised that he was tipping his pitches.\n\nBoth clubs had planned to use openers Wednesday, and New York will almost certainly still use a bullpen day in the series, probably in Game 6. Boone has ridden his relievers hard, asking them to cover 15 1/3 out of 28 innings in the series \u2014 a tough enough task with October\u2019s built-in days off. The rainout leaves Aroldis Chapman, Zack Britton and the rest of that group without some valuable recovery time.\n\nTanaka has been New York\u2019s best bet for length this postseason. He needed just 68 pitches to cover six innings in the opener, improving to 5-2 with a 1.32 ERA in the postseason.\n\n\u201cAnytime the moment gets really big, he is good at slowing the game down himself and maybe taking even a little bit off of his pitches as opposed to powering through it,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see us have a more disciplined approach, but that\u2019s easier said than done with the stuff he has.\u201d\n\nGreinke, a 2009 Cy Young Award winner acquired from Arizona at the July 31 trade deadline, has struggled through two starts this postseason. He allowed six runs and couldn\u2019t finish the fourth inning against Tampa Bay in Game 3 of the AL Division Series, and the Yankees hammered two homers and scored three runs against him in six innings in the ALCS opener.\n\nThe Astros may also lean heavily on relievers in Game 6, if necessary, although their bullpen strategy will differ from New York\u2019s. While the Yankees probably wouldn\u2019t ask any one pitcher for more than two or three innings, Houston could stretch starter Jos\u00e9 Urquidy over four or five innings after an opener. That could keep the rest of the club\u2019s arms fresher during this four-day run.\n\n\u201cHow beneficial it is is probably easier to answer after I see how guys perform and how the pitching plays out,\u201d Hinch said of the rainout. \u201cBut like I said, it\u2019s kind of a wait and see.\u201d\n\nThe previous postseason game to be postponed was Game 4 of the 2017 NL Division Series between the Nationals and Cubs.\n\nSTANTON\u2019S STATUS\n\nBoone remained uncertain Wednesday if slugger Giancarlo Stanton would return to the lineup in Game 4. Stanton was held out of Games 2 and 3 after straining his right quad in the opener.\n\nStanton was set to receive treatment. Boone said he was available to pinch hit Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really close to making that decision yet,\u201d Boone said. \u201cThat will be something that we kind of work through today and possibly even into tomorrow.\u201d\n\nBoone said it was likely that Aaron Hicks will be in the lineup regardless. The center fielder made his first start Tuesday since Aug. 3 due to an elbow injury and went 0 for 2 with two walks.\n\nBoone also doubled down on his vote of confidence for struggling catcher Gary S\u00e1nchez, who is 2 for 21 this postseason. S\u00e1nchez was booed and criticized Tuesday when he couldn\u2019t block a wild fastball from Britton, allowing a run to score.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been excellent behind the plate from a game-calling standpoint, from a game-plan target, receiving,\u201d Boone said. \u201cA lot of people are making a lot of the block. There\u2019s a lot of 94 mph fastballs that guys don\u2019t block. Guys aren\u2019t always set up to block a fastball. That\u2019s kind of a 50/50 play.\u201d\n\nNEW CREW\n\nMike Everitt will replace Jeff Nelson as umpire crew chief for the remainder of the ALCS after Nelson was removed from Game 3 with a concussion. Nelson took two foul balls off his mask before Kerwin Danley swapped in behind home plate. Everitt was the plate umpire for the NL wild-card game this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A rainy day in the Bronx has left a most daunting October test for the New York Yankees vaunted bullpen: four games, four days and already", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/9ca0a5_alcs-astros-yankees-baseball-08881-houston-astros-baseman-jose-altuve-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
