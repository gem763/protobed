The city on Wednesday asked a federal judge to approve its plans for the independent review.\n\nBromwich was the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general from 1994 to 1999 and served as the nation\u2019s top offshore drilling regulator after BP\u2019s deadly Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. He was an attorney for Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers. Kavanaugh denied the accusation.\n\nEight members of the Gun Trace Task Force have been convicted of corruption charges and sentenced to prison. The plainclothes squad resold stolen drugs, conducted robberies and falsified evidence, prosecutors said.\n\nBromwich said Baltimore officials know he won\u2019t be bringing them \u201chappy or consoling news\u201d when he delivers a report on his findings. Bromwich said his team of investigators, most likely a mix of attorneys from his law enforcement consulting firm and outside experts, \u201cwill go where the facts lead us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will examine the questions of not only what happened but why and how,\u201d he said at a news conference.\n\nHarrison said it is \u201cvitally important\u201d to understand how the Gun Trace Task Force\u2019s corruption persisted for years.\n\n\u201cThose who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must, and we will, learn everything we can about the terrible chapter in the BPD\u2019s history and to ensure that it never happens again.\u201d\n\nLast month, Harrison told a state commission that his department hadn\u2019t done a \u201cdeep dive\u201d internally into the root causes of the scandal. But the chief said the matter recently came up during a hearing before U.S. District Judge James Bredar, who is overseeing a federal oversight program requiring sweeping police reforms in Baltimore.\n\nIn a court filing later Wednesday, the city asked the judge to approve its plan for a \u201ccomprehensive, independent, transparent investigation\u201d of the task force members\u2019 misconduct.\n\n\u201cWe can burn off the stink of this horrific scandal only through the use of the disinfectant of full disclosure,\u201d Baltimore City Solicitor Andre Davis said.\n\nBromwich said his team won\u2019t be bound by any time constraints.\n\n\u201cThis is an enormous job, and it will take awhile,\u201d he said.\n\nBaltimore Mayor Bernard \u201cJack\u201d Young said an independent investigation is \u201cessential\u201d to help rebuild trust between the police department and the public.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that the investigation be comprehensive and free from internal pressure,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Brian Witte in Annapolis, Maryland, contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A former federal prosecutor who represented one of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's accusers has been picked to lead an independent review of a corruption-plagued unit of the Baltimore Police Department, the department's chief announced Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Kunzelman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/23/baltimore_police_corruption_50773_c0-125-3000-1875_s1200x700.jpg?5df86175492ddcdc04d9d2b6261257b2d49617ee", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
