vital for Trump, lay low as scandal rages", "language": "en", "text": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Most Republicans in the US Senate have taken the path of least resistance \u2014 staying silent \u2014 as they grapple with President Donald Trump\u2019s swirling impeachment firestorm.\n\nIn a way they hold the key to Trump\u2019s political fortune: Should the president get impeached by the Democratic-led House of Representatives, he would then face a trial in the Senate, the Republican-held chamber he views as his firewall.\n\nWhile Democrats unite in outrage over the US leader\u2019s latest brazen move, a public call for China to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son, outright condemnation by Republicans was rare.\n\nRepublican senators\u2019 silence signaled to those in their home states that while many in Trump\u2019s party may be uncomfortable with his willingness to flout political norms and seek foreign help in the 2020 election, they were offering a form of quiet defense of the president.\n\nConstituent frustration appeared to catch some Republicans off guard, including Senator Joni Ernst, who seeks re-election in 2020.\n\n\u201cYou still stand there silent and your silence is supporting him,\u201d one person told Ernst at a town hall Thursday in her state of Iowa.\n\n\u201cWhere is the line?\u201d asked voter Amy Haskins. \u201cWhen are you guys going to say, \u2018Enough?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for him,\u201d parried Ernst.\n\n\u201cBut you can speak for yourself,\u201d Haskins interrupted.\n\nPressed for a reaction to Trump\u2019s bald suggestion Thursday that China, and earlier Ukraine, investigate his potential 2020 White House challenger, Ernst reverted to the unfounded White House talking point that the Bidens were involved in corruption in those countries.\n\n\u201cCorruption, no matter where it happens, must be fought everywhere,\u201d she said.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio downplayed the controversy, suggesting Trump might have even made the China comments in jest.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a real request or him just needling the press,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nWhile neutral reactions or indirect support of Trump have been common this week, full-throated backing is more elusive.\n\nLoyal ally Senator Lindsey Graham hesitated to defend Trump\u2019s call for China to investigate the Bidens, but he sought to explain the request.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the president pushing back,\u201d Graham told The Washington Post. \u201cHe feels like everyone is coming after him all the time and he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Wrong and appalling\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe president issued a barely veiled warning Friday to those who hold the majority in the Senate, where he would be tried if impeached by the House.\n\n\u201cWe have a great relationship in the Senate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have a 95 percent approval rating in the Republican Party,\u201d Trump added.\n\nWhile he has yet to speak to many senators on the issue, Trump said, \u201cI believe the senators look at this as a hoax.\u201d\n\nFew Senate Republicans are openly castigating him, and election politics is likely a significant reason why.\n\nTwenty-three Republican Senate seats are in play in 2020, compared to just 12 for Democrats, and those in the GOP standing for re-election are loath to cross a president who enjoys an extremely loyal base.\n\nBut some voices are rising up to challenge him.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cbrazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,\u201d tweeted prominent Senator Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012 and currently the party\u2019s most open critic of Trump.\n\nFellow Republican Ben Sasse, at greater risk because he is up for re-election next year, issued some of the harshest language yet attacking Trump\u2019s China comments.\n\n\u201cHold up: Americans don\u2019t look to Chinese commies for the truth,\u201d Sasse told the Omaha World-Herald.\n\n\u201cIf the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that\u2019s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps.\u201d\n\nThe fiery comments made headlines, but they may not move the needle.\n\nFor Trump to be ousted by the Senate, a unified Democratic caucus will need to at least 20 Republicans to defect to their side, a target that currently appears unlikely to be met.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Most Republicans in the US
