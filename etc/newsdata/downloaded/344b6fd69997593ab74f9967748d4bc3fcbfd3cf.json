But Mr. Trumka said his union members were not the deciding factor.\n\n\u201cShe had a 20% labor margin in Pennsylvania,\u201d Mr. Trumka said, adding that the low turnout among black voters for Mrs. Clinton in the state made the difference.\n\nStill, he said the labor movement had redoubled its efforts since then. He described the massive effort by union leadership to better connect with their members and better respond to their concerns.\n\nMr. Trump has boasted that union members are on his side, even if the union leadership opposes him.\n\nMr. Trumka, whose organization is the largest federation of labor unions in the U.S., refused to rank the field of Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nHe said they all had learned a lesson from 2016 and were more pointedly addressing workers\u2019 issues.\n\n\u201cI think the lesson these Democrats learned is that unless you talk about the economic issues that affect working people, you are not going to get elected,\u201d he said.\n\nLabor unions have been slow to endorse a presidential candidate in 2020 after criticism that they too quickly got behind Mrs. Clinton last time.\n\nMr. Trumka said decisions about endorsements would come from the membership or from the ground up. And he said the candidates were being closely scrutinized this time.\n\nThe labor movement \u201csets the bar higher than ever in the 2020 presidential election,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trumka announced that he was traveling to Mexico City to meet with Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to discuss the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which has become a thorny issue for Democrats in the 2020 elections.\n\nThe Trump administration negotiated the USMCA to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement that labor unions and Democrats long disparaged for sending U.S. manufacturing jobs to low-wage Mexico.\n\nMr. Trumka said he was seeking assurances from Mr. Lopez Obrador that his country could enforce the new agreement.\n\nIt was unclear how assurances from Mr. Lopez Obrador would impact the AFL-CIO\u2019s stance on ratifying the new trade deal.\n\n\u201cThe proposed new NAFTA is simply not enforceable,\u201d Mr. Trumka said. \u201cA trade deal without enforcement is a windfall for corporations and a disaster for workers.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s promise to renegotiate NAFTA was a big part of his appeal to blue-collar workers. He made good on the promise, though Congress has yet to ratify USMCA and hand Mr. Trump a trade victory to run on next year.\n\nAt the breakfast, Mr. Trumka was pressed by The Washington Times to name pro-worker accomplishments by Mr. Trump. He credited the president with having the guts to redo NAFTA, but he said it wasn\u2019t enough to win the labor vote in 2020.\n\nHe said it would be easy to convince union members that Mr. Trump was not on their side. He held up a six-page list of Trump administration actions that he said harmed workers, including weakening oversight of pension plans and defending laws that make it more difficult to unionize workplaces.\n\n\u201cWhen he opposed every increase to the minimum wage, you have to ask, \u2018Does he really care about workers?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Trumka said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
