As Trump declared to his adoring fans, without even a hint of humanity about the suffering this would cause to civilians, \u201cSometimes you have to let them fight like two kids. Then you pull them apart.\u201d\n\nThis follows Trump\u2019s comments on Wednesday, when he did his best to callously dispel humanitarian concerns many have voiced for the Kurds. First, Trump dismissively stated that the Kurds were \u201cno angels.\u201d He then did his best to dehumanize both sides in the battle, declaring that the Kurds and Turks have been fighting for \u201chundreds of years,\u201d which he explained in essence is just who these people are. I\u2019m not exaggerating, Trump stated that \u201cwarring\u201d and killing is \u201cunnatural for us, but its sorta natural for them.\u201d\n\nMany were stunned by Trump\u2019s comments, but not me. The why behind Trump\u2019s comments is simple. He was simply updating the old concept of \u201cKill them all, let God sort it out\u201d to \u201clet the Muslims slaughter each other and let Allah sort it out.\n\nWhat do I mean let the Muslims kill each other? Well, Turkey\u2019s population is 99 percent Muslim. While the Kurds, who number overall between 25 and 30 million, are overwhelmingly Muslim. In fact, I\u2019m named after one of the most famous Kurds ever, Saladin, who led the Muslim forces during the Crusades. (I\u2019m not Kurdish, but I am Muslim.)\n\nPence Just Ratified All of Turkey\u2019s War Aims in Syria\n\nThis is far from the first time a conservative has suggested that the U.S. should stay out of Syria and simply let the Muslims there slaughter each other. In 2013, Sarah Palin\u2014who at the time was still relevant in GOP circles\u2014articulated that very concept as she slammed President Obama for contemplating committing U.S. troops to end the civil war in Syria. Palin commented that in a situation with \u201cboth sides shouting \u2018Allah Akbar\u2019 at each other,\u201d we should just \u201clet Allah sort it out.\u201d\n\nPalin, who publicly defended Trump\u2019s despicable Muslim ban in 2015, was obviously playing on the idea of \u201cKill them all and let God sort it out,\u201d but instead used the word \u201cAllah,\u201d conceivably so it would play better with the rabidly anti-Muslim GOP base. (\u201cAllah\u201d simply means God in Arabic.)\n\nLegend has it that this expression, ironically, comes from the Crusades, when in the 13th century a Catholic monk named Arnaud Amalric was asked by the military commander how to differentiate between heretics and Christians shortly before they laid siege to the French city of Beziers. Amalric reportedly responded, \u201cKill them all, God will know his own.\u201d The result was these Christian soldiers slaughtered 20,000 people, including women and children.\n\nThe view that America should stay out of Syria and simply reap the benefits of Muslims killing each other was more recently expressed in a more \u201cintellectual\u201d way by right-wing \u201cscholar\u201d Daniel Pipes, a man with a long history of spewing anti-Muslim bigotry as documented by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nIn 2017, Pipes penned an article for National Review criticizing Trump\u2019s military strike against the ruling Assad regime in Syria for its use of chemical weapons against civilians that killed more than 80. Pipes wrote, \u201cI see this military action as an error. Nothing in the U.S. Constitution requires that American forces fight in every war around the world,\u201d adding, \u201cthis one should be sat out, letting enemies of the United States fight each other to exhaustion.\u201d\n\nPipes\u2019 words, \u201cletting enemies of the United States fight each other to exhaustion,\u201d are nothing more than let the Muslims kill each other. And that\u2019s exactly what Trump has done by greenlighting Turkey\u2019s military operation.\n\nThe only reason Trump pushed for the Thursday ceasefire was the vocal GOP criticism that resulted in 129 House Republicans voting for the resolution condemning his abandonment of the Kurds.\n\nTrump\u2019s defense of his decision to abandon the Kurds revealed his total lack of compassion for the Kurds and even more broadly, Muslims, as human beings.\n\nThis is not surprising given Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign call for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims from our country. And since then, Trump has drastically reduced the number of Muslim refugees admitted to our country, down from nearly 40,000 accepted in 2016 to 4,900 in fiscal year 2019.", "description": "Delil Douleiman/GettyOn Thursday night at his rally in Texas, Donald Trump finally admitted why he greenlit the Turkish military to cross the border into northern Syria to attack the Kurds: He wanted these two groups of Muslims to slaughter each other.
