This is meant to begin a dialogue and a discussion of moving a substantive drug-pricing bill forward,\u201d said Mike Strazzella, a health-care lobbyist at the firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney.\n\nPelosi and her colleagues talked up the need for getting support from Trump, who on Wednesday night reiterated his interest in reducing prices in a tweet.\n\n\u201cWe do hope to have White House buy-in, because that seems to be the route to getting any votes in the United States Senate,\u201d said Pelosi, the California Democrat, in a reference to how Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has blocked Democratic legislative efforts but also has followed Trump\u2019s lead. Her comments came at a news conference that also featured New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, head of the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\n\u201cAs the speaker said, the president is very much the key,\u201d Pallone said. \u201cIf he indicates support, or at least suggests this is a good idea that should be pursued, then hopefully we can get some of the Energy and Commerce Republicans to go along.\u201d\n\nTheir Lower Drug Costs Now Act would have the government each year negotiate the prices for at least 25 of the most expensive drugs in Medicare and the private market. Up to 250 medications could be subject to negotiation. The upper limit for prices would be 1.2 times an average international price, and a failure to reach a negotiated price would subject the manufacturer to a sizable penalty, starting at 65% of gross sales and ramping up to a maximum of 95%. In addition, the bill would set a $2,000 out-of-pocket limit on drugs for seniors on Medicare.\n\n\u201cIn the Grassley bill, there\u2019s a $3,100 cap,\u201d Pelosi said, referring to legislation co-sponsored by Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley that\u2019s among the array of proposals targeting drug prices. \u201cOur bill is better in that respect and many other respects, but we look forward to working in a bipartisan, bicameral way on this.\u201d\n\nGrassley and Pelosi\u2019s approaches are similar in aiming to modernize Medicare in a way that\u2019s beneficiary-friendly, said Kim Monk, an analyst and managing director at Capital Alpha Partners. Monk predicted that Pelosi\u2019s bill has no chance of becoming law, and she gave a chance of \u201cprobably less than 50%\u201d for Grassley\u2019s measure, the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act.\n\n\u201cI do think there will be drug pricing reforms \u2014 probably small-ball reforms,\u201d Monk added. She said there could be a deal that would include a revamp of Medicare\u2019s prescription drug benefit, but \u201cthat\u2019s very tricky, because Democrats want their direct negotiations and Republicans won\u2019t go there.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other House GOP leaders blasted Pelosi\u2019s proposal as a \u201csocialist approach\u201d on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe Pelosi plan is a step toward nationalizing the drug industry and opening the door to a one-size-fits all, government-controlled rationing of prescription drugs,\u201d McCarthy, the California Republican, and his House colleagues said in a statement. \u201cIt also includes an unprecedented 95% tax on companies, which will subsequently drive out competition and force drug makers to close their doors.\u201d McConnell reportedly offered similar criticisms, describing the Pelosi plan\u2019s provisions on Thursday as \u201csocialist price controls\u201d that will damage the health-care system.\n\nWashington is focused on drug prices after health care ranked as the most important issue for voters in the 2018 midterm election. As lawmakers aim to rein in soaring prices, the lobbying spending by seven key drugmakers and the industry\u2019s main trade group, PhRMA, climbed last year to about $70 million \u2014 a level topped only by the $87 million total for 2009, when Obamacare was beginning to shake up the health-care sector.\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi\u2019s radical plan would end the current market-based system that has made the United States the global leader in developing innovative, lifesaving treatments and cures,\u201d said Stephen Ubl, president and CEO of the PhRMA, in a statement. \u201cIt would fundamentally restructure how patients access medicines by giving the federal government unprecedented, sweeping authority to set medicine prices in public and private markets while importing price controls from other countries that restrict access to innovative medicines.\u201d\n\nPharma stocks, as tracked by the Invesco Dynamic Pharmaceuticals ETF PJP, +0.23% , closed 0.3% higher on Thursday, but they\u2019re down 21% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the broad S&P 500 index SPX, +0.00% was up 0.1% on Thursday and has gained 3% in the past 12 months.\n\nA subcommittee of Pallone\u2019s House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on Wednesday on the Lower Drug Costs Now Act and other pricing-related legislation.", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats on Thursday unveil a proposal aimed at lowering drug prices, setting the stage for negotiations on a hot...", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Money", "Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR678_pelosi_ZG_20190919152126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
