Wolfe and Garcia were being held in federal custody Friday and the authorities said Pratt had left the country and was considered a fugitive.\n\nPratt, Wolfe and Garcia are currently on trial in a civil case in San Diego Superior Court that mirrors the criminal filing. In that case, 22 women said they were tricked into performing in internet pornography.\n\nEd Chapin, the lead trial lawyer representing the 22 women, called the alleged scheme \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is despicable,\u201d he said, \u201cand I am glad that the feds are stepping up and that they\u2019ve seen it and are doing something about it.\u201d\n\nCorey D. Silverstein, a First Amendment lawyer based in Michigan whose practice is focused on issues of pornography and similar entertainment, said this was the first case he knew of in which a content producer was prosecuted under these types of charges.\n\n\u201cThe government has a pretty high burden,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to be able to show that someone knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored and patronized a person and then gained value from it.\u201d He said he was \u201cnot convinced the government has a case,\u201d adding, \u201cWas the line crossed from content production to sex trafficking?\u201d\n\nIn court filings, Pratt and Wolfe, who own the websites GirlsDoPorn and GirlsDoToys, said the women had signed contracts that stated the videos they appeared in could be \u201cused anywhere, anyhow, for any purpose.\u201d\n\nThe women also recorded videotaped statements stating that they consented to the videos being used in any way and were not under the influence of drugs or mind-altering substances, according to civil filings from the defendants.\n\nMary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami who is the president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, said many women in the pornography industry have lodged similar complaints of coercion but have not felt comfortable telling anyone. Or, she said, they were afraid that complaints would lead to their not working again.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a massive amount of fraud and coercion,\u201d said Franks, who coproduced a documentary about the world of amateur pornography. \u201cIt\u2019s a very welcome development that all porn companies will be put on notice that there is an appetite to investigate these cases.\u201d\n\nSignificant criminal charges have not been brought by federal authorities against pornography producers for more than a decade. In 2008, Paul F. Little was sentenced to 46 months in jail after being convicted on multiple obscenity charges.\n\nLast year, a federal law strengthened the policing of sex trafficking online.\n\nSouthern California, especially the San Fernando Valley, has historically been home to major pornography studios and producers, but the internet has made it possible for anyone with a cellphone camera to produce and upload explicit content. And the internet involves interstate commerce, which is regulated by the federal authorities.\n\n\u201cTraffickers use many ways to trick, coerce and manipulate,\u201d said Samantha Vardaman, vice president of Shared Hope International, a nonprofit organization that seeks to rescue victims of sex trafficking. \u201cThese brave women suffered exploitation and exposure but they are using the legal remedies to get control back. With the extraordinary abuses of the internet, we will surely see more criminal activity like this.\u201d", "description": "In a case that could test the online pornography industry, the owners and two employees of two popular pornographic websites were charged this week with sex trafficking and other crimes, accused of coercing several women to engage in sex videos that were posted on the internet.According to a criminal", "authors": ["Adeel Hassan", "Katie Van Syckle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5LatxtUn8rRIio0QeoBoVg--~B/aD0yNTgxO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/cb2987d0-edde-11e9-bfe9-563b36e1a5f6", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
