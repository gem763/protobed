Kamala Harris (D-CA) falsely claimed during the Democrat debate Tuesday night that \u201cwomen will die, poor women, women of color will die\u201d because Republican-led states have passed abortion restrictions.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris said during the segment of the debate on health care in Ohio that Republicans \u201chave passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare.\u201d\n\nShe added:\n\nAnd it is not an exaggeration to say, women will die, poor women, women of color will die because these Republican legislators in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with their bodies. Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women\u2019s bodies and let women make the decisions about healthcare issues in America today.\n\nHarris\u2019s statement is a deception that has been spread by Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry for years, but has reached feverish pitch since the pro-life Trump administration has now appointed two Supreme Court justices who intend to interpret the Constitution as it was originally written.\n\nThe fear for abortion rights supporters is that Roe v. Wade will ultimately be overturned. Proponents of abortion have increasingly made more claims that \u201cwomen will die\u201d if this happens, hoping to feed the narrative that a multitude of women died before the 1973 landmark Supreme Court ruling that invented a right to abortion.\n\n\u2018The consequence will be women\u2019s lives.\u2019 \u2014 @PPFA Pres. @DrLeanaWen is explaining the real, deadly results of banning abortion pic.twitter.com/cykbl4JjCA \u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) May 20, 2019\n\nPrior to her recent sudden termination from Planned Parenthood, Dr. Leana Wen, its former president, was a frequent guest on talk shows and posted to Twitter that, if her organization is defunded or abortion is banned, women\u2019s lives will be endangered.\n\n\u201cThousands of women died before Roe v. Wade,\u201d Wen told the Daily Show. \u201cThat could happen now.\u201d\n\nHowever, Planned Parenthood\u2019s own fact sheets tell a very different story.\n\nThe abortion industry giant states:\n\nIn 1965, when abortion was still illegal nationwide except in cases of life endangerment, at least 193 women died from illegal abortions, and illegal abortion accounted for nearly 17 percent of all deaths due to pregnancy and childbirth in that year (Gold, 1990; NCHS, 1967).\n\nThe pro-choice Guttmacher Institute also reported:\n\nBy 1950, illegal abortion deaths fell to \u201cjust over 300,\u201d likely \u201cbecause of the introduction of antibiotics in 1940s, which permitted more effective treatment of the infections frequently developed after illegal abortion.\u201d By 1965, \u201cthe number of deaths due to illegal abortion had fallen to just under 200.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 1972, the year before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe, 24 women died from legal induced abortion \u2013 legal in a handful of states in which abortion in some very limited cases was permitted \u2013 and 39 women died from illegal abortion.\n\nLet\u2019s not kid ourselves. Abortion restrictions work. They have large, rapid effects and save tens of thousands of lives from the cruelty of murder in the womb.https://t.co/zTx7jBWfEo \u2014 The Federalist (@FDRLST) May 20, 2019\n\nIn 1973, when the Supreme Court created a right to abortion, CDC reported 19 deaths from illegal abortions and 25 deaths from legal abortions.\n\nThough abortion reporting measures have not been consistent \u2013 leading to differing results \u2013 none of the reports gave the indication that \u201cthousands\u201d of women died in illegal abortions prior to Roe v. Wade.\n\nAs pro-life organization Live Action reported, NARAL founder and former abortionist Bernard Nathanson admitted he and others fabricated large numbers of deaths from illegal abortions prior to the high court\u2019s decision in Roe.\n\nAccording to the report, in his 1979 book, Aborting America, Nathanson called the \u201cthousands\u201d claim a \u201cnice, round, shocking figure.\u201d\n\nLife News reported Nathanson said of the fabrication, \u201c[I]n the \u2018morality\u2019 of our revolution, it was a useful figure, widely accepted so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics?\u201d\n\nWen and now other abortion industry leaders and their political allies, however, are still suggesting \u201cwomen will die\u201d if abortion is banned. The fact is, women still die during \u201clegal\u201d abortions and \u201cthousands\u201d of children die each year because abortion is not banned.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris especially claimed \u201cwomen of color\u201d will die. Ironically, Planned Parenthood aborts the lives of more than 300,000 children each year, and 18 million of the 59 million abortions that have been performed in this country since the Roe v. Wade decision have ended the lives of babies \u201cof color.\u201d\n\nHarris likely interjected the comments about abortion in the wake of complaints by Planned Parenthood and its allies that Democrats had failed to raise the issue of abortion rights during any of their debates thus far. Planned Parenthood responded favorably on Twitter to Harris\u2019s remarks:", "description": "Sen.
