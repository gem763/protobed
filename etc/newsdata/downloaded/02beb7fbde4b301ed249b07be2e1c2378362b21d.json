You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut Labour accused the government of being \u201chypocritical\u201d after years of cuts to policing budgets.\n\nThe new measures form part of a tough new approach to crime that includes recruiting 20,000 more police officers, increasing the use of tasers and lengthening sentences for sexual and violent crimes.\n\nMs Patel said: \u201cWe have been a soft touch on foreign criminals for too long. The sentence for breaching a deportation order is far too low at the moment and many criminals conclude that it\u2019s worth trying to get back in the country when all you get is a slap on the wrist.\n\n\u201cDeterring foreign criminals from re-entering the country and putting those that do behind bars for longer will make our country safer.\u201d\n\nUnder the plans, foreign national offenders who are deported but try to return to the UK will face much longer time in jail than the current six-month maximum. The government estimates that 40,000 people breach deportation orders each year, although it is not clear how many of them are criminals.\n\nAt the same time, a new law will give the police the power to arrest any suspect who is the subject of a Red Notice from Interpol. Currently, police must first apply for a warrant to carry out the arrest - a process which the government says typically takes at least six hours.\n\nHowever, only suspects wanted by a small number of UK allies, including the US, Australia and Canada, will be apprehended. EU countries are not included in the bill because the UK will remain part of the European Arrest Warrant, which gives police similar power, after Brexit.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

penalties, with ministers abolishing the most serious offenders an automatic release clause that allows them to be released halfway through their prison term. Instead, they will have to serve at least two-thirds of their sentence.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The law, which was introduced in the last parliamentary session, includes a new definition of domestic abuse making clear that abuse can be financial, emotional or coercive, as well as physical. It will also ensure that courts assume by default that domestic abuse victims should qualify for special measures, such as giving evidence via video link rather than in person.\n\nThe so-called Helen\u2019s Law, which will see murderers who refused to disclose information on their victims received longer sentences, will be one of the first bills introduced in the new parliamentary session, with draft legislation due to be tabled on Tuesday. It is named after Helen McCourt, who was murdered in 1988.\n\nResponding to the government\u2019s announcement, Labour\u2019s Diane Abbott said: \u201cIt is hypocritical for the Tories to set out these plans when they were the ones who imposed cuts and let crime soar in the first place. Everything was cut, from schools to the NHS, to the police to mental health services. They all had terrible consequences.\n\n\u201cThis Queen\u2019s Speech is farcical. It is just an uncosted wish list which the government has no intention and no means to deliver, and nothing more than a pre-election party political broadcast.\n\n\u201cThe Home Secretary is right that the Tories have been a soft touch for criminals, with policies that predictably led to more crime. We always argued that cuts have consequences, and now the Tories are trying to pretend the consequences have nothing to do with them. Labour in government will end austerity, and properly invest in our communities and transform society.\u201d", "description": "The government will promise a\u00a0hardline\u00a0new approach to crime and justice on Monday as ministers use the\u00a0Queen\u2019s Speech to announce a crackdown on foreign criminals.
