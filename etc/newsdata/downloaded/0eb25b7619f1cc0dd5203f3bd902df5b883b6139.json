I think that\u2019s what [the film] really meant for me.\u201d\n\nGonz\u00e1lez agreed, pointing to the issues the film deals with. \u201cI loved the script, it was smart, and it was different, and it was a movie I would\u2019ve liked to watch when I was a younger girl. It talks about real issues: about body shaming, society\u2019s pressure of looking a certain way. It also deals with this side of perfection that we have embedded as women from the moment we\u2019re born. It talks about human sexuality, anxiety, dieting, body types, oppressiveness, fear, indecisiveness of who you want to be and social economics. I thought it was a very subtle but beautifully-written movie.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Paradise Hills' Film Review: Emma Roberts Flourishes in Lush, Feminist Sci-Fi\n\nGonz\u00e1lez plays Amarna, a Mexican pop star who is sent to the island to learn to be more in line with what her managers want, and to also learn who she is as she confronts her sexuality. Of course, Gonz\u00e1lez, aside from her acting career, also has a few music albums under her belt.\n\n\u201cAmarna really resonated with me because I grew up in the public eye in Mexico and I was defining who I was as a human being at the time,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said about her character. \u201cI was going through my fair share of insecurities, feeling myself, not feeling myself, and discovering who I was. I think that\u2019s why I wanted to play her: She was an oath to the younger version of me when I was a pop star and had to be the perfect version of who I was when I was dealing with so many insecurities. And I want girls to know that even on that side, even when you\u2019re in the public eye, we are all going through struggles all the time, it doesn\u2019t matter what age you are.\u2019\n\nAwkwafina wanted to be a part of the movie because she loved the overall message and the uniqueness of the world Waddington had created. She plays Yu, young musician who needs to be refined because she is going to live with her wealthy relatives in mainland China. At the school, she just wants to be left alone.\n\n\u201cI think she represented someone who was very tormented as a result of being rejected by her own family and as a result, I think, turns to this kind of explosive anger and kind of has to shut out the part of her that is kind and that cares for people and in doing so, she loses herself,\u201d Awkwafina explained. \u201cBut then I think that, you know, towards the end she comes to her senses a little bit but I think she\u2019s someone who really feels thrown away.\u201d\n\n\u201cParadise Hills\u201d is about Uma (Roberts) who wakes up on an island called Paradise, where women get taught how to be proper. It\u2019s run by the Duchess (Milla Jovovich), and the institute prides itself on teaching women the ideals of being a female. However, nothing is as it seems and below the beautiful facade, something sinister lurks. Emma Roberts\u2019s character is sent to the school to prepare her to marry someone she isn\u2019t keen on. Danielle Macdonald\u2019s character is being forced to slim down. The film had its premiere at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nAlso Read: 'Paradise Hills' Director Alice Waddington on What She Hopes Young Women Will Learn From the Film (Video)\n\nAnother draw to the project for Gonz\u00e1lez was the amazing cast that had already joined, with whom she\u2019s formed wonderful friendships, and she said she also wanted to be part of \u201cParadise Hills\u201d because she wanted to work with a Latina director.\n\n\u201cI wanted to work a female, Spanish-speaking director,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cAs an actress and having the chance of being on this side of Hollywood, I really have to support my women and support my people and there are so many good, talented directors in Latin America and Spain that it\u2019s hard for me not to do it.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "Alice Waddington\u2019s \u201cParadise Hills\u201d is about an island where women get sent to get reformed, and stars Awkwafina and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez think that the entire fantastical movie comments about values society places on women \u2014 which is why it\u2019s important for young women to see the film.\u201cIt really was a movie", "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TNF16IHZfo8o9FjA4mv7YQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/ad17132f74f2b35b9d30bf36539d5d5b", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
