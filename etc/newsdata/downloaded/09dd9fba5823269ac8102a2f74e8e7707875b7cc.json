Many of these patients have \u201cunderlying issues that can be corrected,\u201d Khelemsky says. \u201cFor instance, if you have abdominal pain and gallstones, you can take the gallbladder out, and it gets better.\u201d That is called acute pain, and it usually resolves within six months.\n\nAnother group of people have what Khelemsky calls \u201cvague\u201d pain \u2014 when the source is unclear \u2014 that lasts more than six months. \u201cPerhaps chronic muscle, joint, back or knee pain,\u201d he says. It could be pain that continues after an illness has ended or an injury has healed, or it could involve conditions such as fibromyalgia, arthritis, neuropathy, back problems or irritable bowel syndrome. \u201cAmong this group, with some, we know what it is, and we can kind of fix it; some, we really can\u2019t fix it, or the treatments don\u2019t fix it a good proportion of the time. We see that much more often in our profession,\u201d Khelemsky says. \u201cThere just isn\u2019t a good permanent solution.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is chronic pain, and treating it requires more than the occasional appointment and prescription for medication or therapy. In recognition of that fact, the medical community is turning to other approaches, including increasing patient support and education and improving overall wellness, perhaps with alternative treatments.\n\nIncreased support\n\nOne factor researchers are looking at is continued care outside of office visits. A pilot study published in the Clinical Journal of Pain examined the impact of supportive text messages with guidance and encouragement, such as, \u201cMake plans to spend time with a friend or family member today by phone or video chat,\u201d or, \u201cYou are in control of your health and happiness. Don\u2019t let the small setbacks you experience discourage you.\u201d The researchers found these texts reduced patients\u2019 perception of their pain and decreased the extent to which it hindered their day-to-day life.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA 2019 study of 294 chronic pain patients examined how other out-of-office treatments might improve pain symptoms, as well as mood-related conditions such as depression and anxiety. In the research, the first group of patients were put on a Web-based self-management program with modules about coping with pain, pain medications, communicating with providers, cognitive strategies and more; the patients did regular self-reporting of symptoms and got reminders to complete their modules.\n\nThe second group was treated with the Web-based self-management program, but the patients were also monitored by a nurse who would contact them to add and adjust medications for pain and facilitate mental health referrals for depression and anxiety,\u201d according to study lead researcher Kurt Kroenke, professor of medicine at Indiana University and a research scientist at Regenstrief Institute. \u201cThe nurse had weekly care management meetings with the supervising physician to develop treatment plans for new patients as well as those who were not responding adequately to their current treatment regimens,\u201d he says.\n\nThe results of continued care were promising. \u201cBoth groups had moderate improvement in their pain and mood symptoms, and the improvement was superior what has historically been seen in primary care studies where the control arm simply received \u2018usual primary care,\u2019 \u201d Kroenke says. \u201cThe patient group that additionally received telecare from the nurse-physician team had further improvement beyond that experienced by the group that only received online self-management.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore providers and health systems are implementing digital methods of care, such as patient portals, so patients can reach their physicians to communicate progress. Using technology to bolster treatment and educate patients could prove especially helpful for those who have chronic conditions.\n\nKroenke says it\u2019s critical that patients with pain receive more than a single appointment with a doctor during a busy day. \u201cAll single treatments have, on average, modest effects in reducing pain, which means that changing, adjusting or combining treatments is often necessary to optimize outcomes,\u201d he says. That means \u201cfollowing up at regular intervals to monitor and adjust treatment.\u201d\n\nRichard W. Rosenquist, chairman of the department of pain management at the Cleveland Clinic, believes patients with chronic pain benefit from attending organized programs run by a variety of medical specialists to keep up with treatment and self-care options. \u201cWe have a program at Cleveland Clinic called Back on TREK ,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a chronic back pain program with psychologists, physical therapists, spine specialists and other physicians involved. Part of chronic-pain healing is the shared experience; people with back pain find out they\u2019re not alone in the world \u2014 there are other people with the same problem.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany of these programs exist across the country for other conditions. For instance, Dan Clauw, director of the Chronic Pain & Fatigue Research Clinic at the University of Michigan, holds regular seminars about living with and managing fibromyalgia.\n\nThere\u2019s promising research that patient education may relieve pain symptoms or improve physical functioning. In a study of people with low-back pain, receiving one-on-one counseling with a physiotherapist increased their ability to do a forward bend and straight leg raise. There\u2019s also evidence that public education on chronic pain, through means such as social media and education classes, can help people avoid risk factors and advocate for family members who are experiencing pain.\n\nBoosting overall wellness\n\nAnother factor in managing and preventing chronic pain is overall wellness. \u201cThe first thing is to stay physically fit and physically active,\u201d Khelemsky says. \u201cIf I could change one thing [it would be that] everyone would eat a proper diet and do some type of physical activity where you\u2019re using your muscles. It\u2019s not just good for the physical body, but it\u2019s good for the emotional state, as well.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMaintaining a healthy weight can also help long-term, so you are not stressing your joints. \u201cYou have to think of the downstream effect of the pain,\u201d Khelemsky says, noting that people tend to experience more of it as they get older. \u201cIf people set themselves up to deal with pain better, disability and suffering decreases.\u201d\n\nThere are also more doctors and hospitals with integrative programs, such as the Duke University Medical Center, the University of California at San Francisco and Mayo Clinic. This approach considers non-traditional therapies such as yoga, acupuncture, meditation and more as part of a holistic approach to treatment.\n\n\u201cIn our wellness institute, we have an integrative pain program that involves using tai chi, diet changes, therapy and other lifestyle changes,\u201d Rosenquist says. \u201cWe have a Functional Medicine Center led by Dr. Mark Hyman, which focuses on improving access to care, looking at the role of psychology, the diet and exercise in treating chronic pain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAll of these contribute to reducing overall levels of pain and are things that are actually important when looking at a long-term view,\u201d Rosenquist says.\u201d If you\u2019re smoking, overweight or sedentary, the likelihood of good long-term outlook goes down. It\u2019s important to talk about the lifestyle change.\u201d\n\nFunctional medicine physicians may look through a different lens than your primary care physician. Yeral Patel, a family medicine physician and integrative specialist in Newport Beach, Calif., says she sees lots of patients for chronic pain syndromes, injury recovery, back and neck pain, and carpal tunnel. \u201cFunctional medicine doctors try to dig deeper and look at the root causes of the pain,\u201d Patel says. \u201cWe try to identify the possible causes of inflammation, such as gut dysfunction, micronutrient deficiency, insulin resistance and inflammatory markers.\n\nAfter taking an extensive history and doing a battery of tests to look at smaller contributing factors that might be preventing recovery, you\u2019ll get an integrative plan \u201cthat utilizes nutrition, exercise and diet, supplements, and mediation for stress management,\u201d Patel says.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe has also found alternative therapies helpful. \u201cAcupuncture is great to add as an adjunctive therapy and helps release endorphins, the \u2018feel good\u2019 hormones that can help relieve pain and improve a patient\u2019s sense of well-being,\u201d Patel says. \u201cSupplements taken with a physician\u2019s guidance such as turmeric, omega-3, B vitamins, Quercetin and Boswellia are great for decreasing inflammation and alleviating pain.\u201d Always let your doctor know of current regular and pain medications you\u2019re taking before starting supplements, so they can check interactions.\n\nJenna Birch is a journalist, dating coach and author of \u201cThe Love Gap: A Radical Plan to Win in Life and Love.\u201d\n\nMore from Lifestyle:\n\nAD", "description": "This kind of pain can be especially challenging to treat.", "authors": ["Jenna Birch"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/g98FFBKZV9_zjDpIHfrLH4f4hms=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KN6LGRHMHUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
