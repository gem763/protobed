A developer has recreated this iconic analog experience for the digital age, so you can try it out straight from your browser \u2014 and it\u2019s glorious\u2026ly flawed.\n\nThere are a few differences between a real rotary dial and this browser-based replica. For one, the real thing will only let you push a digit until it reaches the end \u2014 this one, though, lets you go until you stop (or reach 0). So if you\u2019re determined to make it work, you might want to exercise some patience and try to be precise.\n\nOh, and you also absolutely need to stay within the lines, otherwise the rotary dial simply resets and makes you start over.\n\nEach digit that flashes red at the arrow gets registered in the field above the rotary dial. Click Clear when you want to enter another number.\n\n\u201cIt was supposed to be a gag, I made the whole thing in a few hours on my Saturday,\u201d creator Victor Ribeiro writes. \u201cMy dad used to fix telephones when I was growing up. I remember fiddling with them a lot. If you grab the disc and rotate it, even without the finger on the proper number hole, the number that would be recognized was the number on the \u2018recognition\u2019 area. I tried to put that on my code. If you let go of the disc going outside or inside of it, it will activate the spring back movement.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re curious to look under the hood, the developer has shared the code for the digital rotary dial on GitHub.\n\nNow give it your best shot at staying within the circle by clicking here. Just don\u2019t call me.\n\nCheck out more bored programmers doing bored programmer stuff:\n\n\u27a4 Bored programmers on Reddit are competing to tell the nerdiest coder joke\n\n\u27a4 Bored programmer trains AI to rename all of the UK\n\nRead next: China\u2019s social credit system isn\u2019t about scoring citizens \u2014 it\u2019s a massive API", "description": "One very bored programmer recreated a rotary dial in the browser \u2014 but good luck using it if you can't stay within the circle.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FAnnotation-2019-10-15-141141.png&signature=8cf5cb22b622777ee100e65b277e0700", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
