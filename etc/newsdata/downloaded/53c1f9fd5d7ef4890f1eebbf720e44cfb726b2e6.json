Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez loses her seat next year. She has raised more than $3.4 million, is better known than some presidential candidates and handily won a district that is among the bluest in the nation.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped people \u2014 lots of them \u2014 from trying to unseat her.\n\nSo far, eight Republicans and three Democrats have filed to run for Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s seat in the Bronx and Queens. Two of the Republicans have each raised more than $420,000, even though no Republican has represented the Bronx in Congress in at least 50 years.\n\nThe moonshot nature of these candidacies, and the fervor for them regardless \u2014 the candidates, in both parties, have made the rounds on Fox News and become darlings of conservative media \u2014 underscores the fame and rancor that have surrounded Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe campaigns also highlight a broader strategy by the Republican Party: turning voters\u2019 resentment toward Ocasio-Cortez into a conduit for the party\u2019s other electoral goals. By encouraging attacks on Ocasio-Cortez, Republicans hope to inspire a trickle-down effect onto lower-profile, but much more vulnerable, Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhen she\u2019s forced to explain what she stands for and what she has pushed the Democratic Party to embrace from a policy standpoint, that is an electoral boon for Republicans,\u201d said Michael McAdams, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nA spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment.\n\nThe chances of an upset remain slim, despite the national attention to the race.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, with her social media savvy and outspoken advocacy for left-wing policies, has cultivated 5.5 million Twitter followers and a worshipful base of supporters who donated $1.4 million to her reelection bid between July and September alone. She has $1.91 million on hand.\n\nProgressive candidates covet her political blessing; her decision to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for president in Queens on Saturday was seen as a major victory for his campaign.\n\nBut for the challengers, running \u2014 even with a near-guarantee of defeat \u2014 has few downsides. They can raise thousands off Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s name alone; earn exposure for future campaigns; and bask in the attention, even if only for a short time.\n\nFor her part, Ocasio-Cortez has used the swell of challengers as fundraising fodder.\n\nIn an email to supporters soon after the Republican candidates\u2019 contribution numbers were reported, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign announced an \u201cemergency goal\u201d of nearly $850,000 \u2014 the sum of the Republicans\u2019 hauls \u2014 for October. If met, Ocasio-Cortez would be on track to raise more than $2.5 million in the next quarter.\n\nBy contrast, in New York\u2019s 15th Congressional District, which borders Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s, only one candidate has raised more than $400,000 in a quarter, even though the race is considered competitive: The incumbent, Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano, a Democrat, has announced his retirement.\n\nIt is unclear how much support the challengers to Ocasio-Cortez will receive from their party establishments. Traditionally, state and local parties back incumbents, but Ocasio-Cortez has rankled fellow Democrats with her and her supporters\u2019 unabashed willingness to back primary challenges against longtime officeholders.\n\nIn a recent fundraising email, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s team wrote that ever since her victory, \u201ccorporate Democrats have been waiting for their chance to strike back.\u201d\n\nThe Queens County Democratic Party \u2014 the longtime power base of former Rep. Joe Crowley, whom Ocasio-Cortez defeated \u2014 did not return a request for comment on Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s primary challengers.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) arrives for a House Oversight Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., Feb. 27, 2019.
