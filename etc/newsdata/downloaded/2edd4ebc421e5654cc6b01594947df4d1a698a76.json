The pain was so intense that I was unable to sleep and I spent almost six months in hospital.\n\nThe burns eventually developed into scar tissue and it was then that I became self-conscious about my body \u2013 especially when exercising.\n\nUp until that point I had loved football, trampolining and general exercise, but what stopped me from participating again was the fear of being bullied my peers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI remember them not only mocking the bandages and pressure gloves I had to wear for medical reasons, but also bullying me over my less expensive trainers.\n\nOn top of that, I felt self conscious as my scars make me sweat a lot and the extra medical coverings like bandages didn\u2019t help that matter.\n\nWhat changed things for me was 50 Cent\u2019s In Da Club.\n\nGrowing up as a teenager in Hackney, I was inspired by 50 Cent\u2019s muscles and I thought the tattoos that covered his arms looked similar to the scars that covered mine.\n\nI assumed 50 Cent was a confident man \u2013 especially as he was constantly surrounded by women in music videos \u2013 and I wanted to feel like that.\n\nI started exercising indoors and bought myself dumbbells and a bench. While working out I would blast 50 Cent\u2019s music to give me extra motivation.\n\nWhat changed things for me was 50 Cent\u2019s In Da Club (Picture: Deji Yusuf)\n\nAfter about six months I started to see changes in my body and started to have more energy throughout the day.\n\nBut I also started re-gaining the body confidence I had lost. In the summer I started to wear white transparent shirts, or sometimes vests, so that people could see my new muscles.\n\nAlthough people would still stare, the feeling of being fit gave me an indescribable joy that kept me going.\n\nIt gave me the confidence to join a public gym in Hackney. I was a big boy and my scars did draw a lot of attention. Many would speak to me and applaud me for my bravery, while some perceived me to be a \u2018bad boy\u2019 or \u2018gangster\u2019. It earned me the nickname \u2018scars.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEither way I felt accepted, which is what I needed at the time, and I started going to the gym every day. Exercise and the gym community changed the way I felt about myself and the way I saw my body.\n\nI understand it is normal to look at people who look differently to you, but I would urge everyone to try and avoid staring at others \u2013 or drawing your friends\u2019 attention to look at them.\n\nIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve experienced and is part of the reason it took me so long to embrace my body.\n\nMost people living with scars are already hyper-aware of their surroundings, knowing that people could be looking at them.\n\nIf you do feel the need to know what happened to that person, maybe try and be their friend before just walking up and asking what happened.\n\nIt\u2019s something that always makes me feel uncomfortable and like it\u2019s the only thing the person asking can see when they look at me. I used to ask myself: \u2018can\u2019t they see that I am also a handsome man?\u2019\n\nI\u2019m so grateful that I got into exercise when I did as I truly believe how you feel about yourself can determine your success in life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would not have achieved a first class honours degree in biomedical science or have become a motivational speaker if I had not been working on my confidence.\n\nNow I help other people feel more comfortable with their bodies, and as a qualified social worker I also help children with low self-esteem.\n\nI never imagined I would be able to go to the gym, let alone feel how I do now. I know that my scars make me a star.\n\nYou can find out more about Deji and his Scars2Stars initiative here.\n\nMORE: How can social media have a less toxic effect on our body image and mental health?\n\nMORE: Woman who suffers with saggy skin due to health condition is now a body image influencer\n\nMORE: My Label and Me: I\u2019m scarred but not scared\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "At 14 I had sustained third degree burns to my upper body and I was scared of showing my arms in the gym.", "authors": ["Deji Yusuf"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Deji-bd67_1571398194.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
