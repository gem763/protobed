Similar crowds were reported in Brisbane and other state capitals.\n\nDanielle Porepilliasana, a Sydney high school student, had a blunt message for politicians like Australian Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, who told parliament on Thursday that students should stay in class.\n\n\"World leaders from everywhere are telling us that students need to be at school doing work,\" she said, wearing anti-coal earrings. \"I'd like to see them at their parliaments doing their jobs for once.\"\n\n'A good sign and not at all a nuisance,' Thai minister says\n\nThe UN summit brings together world leaders to discuss climate change mitigation strategies, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources from fossil fuels.\n\nThe issue is vital to low-lying Pacific islands, which have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels.\n\nPeople carry a giant globe with the inscription, 'There is no planet B' during a demonstration in Berlin.
