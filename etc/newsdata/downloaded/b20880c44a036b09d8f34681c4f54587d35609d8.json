It was not immediately possible to verify his account.\n\nWhile the institution told parents it was an Islamic teaching centre that would help straighten out wayward family members, the instructors instead brutally abused them and took away any food or money sent by relatives.\n\nPolice said they had arrested the owner of the facility and two teachers, and were tracking other suspects.\n\nThe more than 200 captives who escaped were still missing, Gambo said. Police were working to reunite the others with family members.\n\n\"The inmates are actually from different parts of the country - Kano, Taraba, Adamawa and Plateau States,\" he said. \"Some of them are not even Nigerians. They come from Niger, Chad and even Burkina Faso and other countries.\"\n\nIslamic schools, called Almajiris, are common in the mostly Muslim north of Nigeria. Muslim Rights Concern, a local organisation, estimates about 10 million children attend them.\n\nBuhari said the government planned to ban the schools eventually, but he has not yet commented on the Katsina school.
