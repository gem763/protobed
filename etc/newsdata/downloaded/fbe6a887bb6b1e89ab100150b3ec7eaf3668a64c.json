People (and professional smart home integrators) have used Connect:Amps in all sorts of wacky ways, from driving multiple sets of ceiling speakers in mono to hacking together TV speaker setups using a box that was never designed for that. The Connect:Amp is tremendously useful, but slightly underpowered at 55 watts per channel, and the basic hardware is getting fairly long in the tooth.\n\nSo Sonos is adding to the lineup with the new $599 Sonos Amp, which is a totally new design that offers unparalleled flexibility for a connected audio component. It is vastly more powerful than the Connect:Amp at 125 watts per channel, and vastly more capable, with AirPlay 2 support, HDMI input, and a huge variety of custom control settings and configurations.\n\nYou can use the Amp to drive a pair of bookshelf speakers. You can pair it with two more Sonos speakers and a subwoofer and build a 4.1 home theater around your TV. You can control it with Alexa (and eventually Google Assistant). You can run giant vintage speakers with it. You can rack mount it, if you are the sort of person with equipment racks in the basement. It does all of these things easily and with aplomb, and it firmly cements Sonos as the most flexible, powerful connected audio system available.\n\nOur review of Sonos Amp Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Powerful\n\nSounds great after you adjust it\n\nLooks super cool Bad Stuff A little bright-sounding out of the box\n\nExpensive\n\nNeeds different EQ presets for music and TV\n\nThe Sonos Amp is a sleek, minimal black square. There\u2019s a round depression on the top that adds a sense of high design, but also serves to make stacking multiple Amps easier. On the front, you\u2019ve got the usual Sonos interface elements of an LED and touch buttons for volume and play / pause, while the back has RCA and HDMI inputs, two Ethernet jacks, a subwoofer output, the power connector, the pairing button, and the speaker connections.\n\nLet me just say: I love the speaker connections on the Sonos Amp. The basic connectors are designed for banana plugs for a clean install, but if you\u2019re running bare speaker wire there\u2019s a very clever adapter that has standard screw terminals, which you then plug into the Amp. This sounds small, but it means you can fit the wires into the screw terminals without having to reach around the Amp itself \u2014 you connect the wires first and then just plug the adapter into the Amp. It\u2019s clever, and it makes connections in tight spots so much easier.\n\nI love the speaker connections on the Sonos Amp\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got everything plugged in, setup is the same as any other recent Sonos device: you open the app, open the new device setup process, and hit the pair button on the back. I was using my own speakers, as I suspect most people will do, but if you buy the special Sonos Architectural speakers made by Sonance, you can run the Trueplay tuning process. (Why can\u2019t TruePlay tune other speakers? Sonos says it can\u2019t predict what speakers you might be using and what their capabilities might be. I still think you should be allowed to try, though.)\n\nI tested the Amp with three speaker systems in my house, all of which are very different: the Klipsch Cornwall IIIs in my living room, which are gigantic 90-pound monsters designed in the \u201870s, a pair of Polk Atrium5 two-way outdoor speakers that hang over our deck, and the Monitor Audio Radius 270 home theater speakers in our media room.\n\nThe Polk outdoor speakers have always been connected to a Sonos Connect:Amp, and in short tests (it\u2019s cold outside!) I can\u2019t say I noticed a huge difference in sound quality. What I did notice was a difference in volume at different points on the volume slider: the Connect:Amp was plenty powerful for that application before, and it seemed to get louder faster than the Amp. According to Benji Rappoport, principal hardware product manager at Sonos, the increased power of the Amp is only noticeable when the volume slider is over halfway up, although the company is thinking about adjusting this in a future software update.\n\nI never really run my outdoor speakers at levels that high, so it wasn\u2019t a huge deal. If you\u2019ve got a setup with Connect:Amps and you\u2019re happy with it, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see enough improvement to justify an upgrade, unless you are ride-or-die for AirPlay 2 or you absolutely need more power.\n\nThe Klipsch setup was the real eye-opener. The Cornwall IIIs have a decades-old design, with massive 15-inch woofers and a powerful midrange horn. They\u2019re usually connected to a \u201870s vintage Kenwood solid-state amp that puts out around 100 watts, and the whole rig can get incredibly loud without losing any detail. (Fun fact: vintage amps often have less total harmonic distortion than modern ones!)\n\nThe older Connect:Amp wasn\u2019t powerful enough for these speakers, while the new Amp is definitely up to the task. But the sound out of the box is entirely too bright and precise, which is a criticism other reviewers have made as well. I had to spend some time dialing in the Amp\u2019s EQ settings in the app (which are surprisingly minimal) to get to something that sounded more suited to the speakers and the room. This is where I wish Sonos either offered Trueplay tuning for third-party speakers or had more granular controls in the app; the Amp can fit into a lot of situations, but it\u2019ll definitely need to be EQ\u2019d out of its defaults in many of them.\n\nThe Amp\u2019s sound will definitely need to be adjusted for your speakers and room\n\nOnce I had the Amp dialed in, it sounded great \u2014 clean, powerful, confident. I can\u2019t say I love it as much as my vintage amp, but that is probably as emotional as anything, since the Amp doesn\u2019t have VU meters or extremely satisfying switches and knobs to play with.\n\nThere was a time when we spent entire evenings picking out records and using the vintage system; that time went away when our baby was born last year. Having those speakers directly tied to Sonos without the delicate vintage amp in the middle meant that we used them a lot more, and spent more time listening to music \u2014 which ultimately makes up for the buttons and knobs, I think.\n\nOne thing the Amp does not have is a built-in microphone for a voice assistant, which makes sense: it\u2019s often tucked away in a cabinet or rack, and it wouldn\u2019t be able to hear you anyway. But it integrates with voice assistants the same as other Sonos products, and it was great to be able to say \u201cAlexa, play music in the living room\u201d and have our biggest and best speakers light up. Same with AirPlay 2, which worked seamlessly.\n\n(One thing to note if you are an insane purist: the Amp is a digital amplifier, so while you can plug a turntable into it, it will necessarily convert that audio to a digital signal. I couldn\u2019t really hear a difference, but if you really need an all-analog signal chain in your life, you\u2019ll have to look elsewhere. If you\u2019re reading this while streaming Spotify to your AirPods, you can really just move on.)\n\nSonos\u2019 user research around the Connect:Amp revealed that a surprising number of people use them with TVs \u2014 which required jumping through quite a few hoops to make work correctly with the old box. So the new Amp has the same HDMI ARC input system as the Sonos Beam soundbar, which means you can just plug a TV right into the Amp and get to a 2.1 system with a subwoofer. (Sonos also sells an optical-to-HDMI adapter in case you need to run optical from your TV; I tried this with the Beam and it introduced a slight delay, so I\u2019d test it thoroughly if that\u2019s your setup.)\n\nThe TV integration worked and sounded excellent in my testing, with the same sense that the Amp might be a little bright out of the box. I definitely missed my full Atmos surround setup, but you can pair two more Sonos speakers to fill out a basic surround experience. What I surprisingly didn\u2019t miss was my center channel speaker \u2014 dialogue sounded clear and well-placed using my two Monitor Audio towers in stereo. The only thing I\u2019d want is the ability to set different EQ settings for music and TV, which seems like a miss.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard for me to say how my experience will work for you \u2014 it\u2019s all down to what speakers you have and where they\u2019re located relative to your TV. I also can\u2019t say that it makes sense to buy a $599 high-end amp to run bookshelf speakers as TV speakers when you can buy a Sonos Beam for $200 less, but if you have ceiling speakers or you really want to consolidate your living room audio situation around some beloved bookshelf speakers, it becomes an attractive option.\n\nUnder new CEO Patrick Spence, Sonos has not only increased the pace of new product introductions, it\u2019s slowly expanded the breadth of ways it can deliver audio in your house. There\u2019s the regular set of Sonos standalone speakers and soundbars, like the Sonos One and Beam, but there\u2019s also new partnerships with traditional AV companies like Onkyo to let the Sonos Connect control receivers directly.\n\nAnd now there\u2019s the new Amp, which is designed to fill in virtually every other gap with the full set of Sonos\u2019 capabilities, whether that\u2019s running a set of hidden speakers in the ceiling, making your vintage speakers connect to a modern music platform, or just making your TV play nice with your audio setup in the living room. That breadth means the Sonos home audio ecosystem is still the one to beat, and the new Amp is the sort of audio product that none of the tech giants have ever really put out: competent, focused, and complete.", "description": "Sonos\u2019 new Amp is a $600 amplifier for your existing speakers that makes it easy to integrate them into a Sonos system.", "authors": ["Nilay Patel", "Mar", "Photography Amelia Holowaty Krales", "The Verge"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aylfryc4B5EBoObZkTNsXuBqWnA=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15945632/akrales_190306_3274_0069.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-07"}
