EU officials fear they may be \u201cled up the garden path\u201d by British negotiators, who had been visiting the EU capital frequently for talks, but with little sign of actual progress.\n\nThe admission is an about-face by the British government. Speaking alongside Angela Merkel in Berlin last month, Mr Johnson said he was \u201cmore than happy\u201d with the \u201cblistering timetable\u201d of finding a replacement for the backstop within 30 days.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We have now shared in written form a series of confidential technical non-papers which reflect the ideas the UK has been putting forward.\n\n\u201cWe will table formal written solutions when we are ready, not according to an artificial deadline, and when the EU is clear that it will engage constructively on them as a replacement to the backstop.\u201d\n\nThe December 2020 date named by Mr Barclay is the end of the transition period negotiated by Theresa May. The EU has consistently said that if the withdrawal agreement is not approved, there cannot be a transition period \u2013 and that without a Northern Ireland backstop, there cannot be a withdrawal agreement.\n\nMr Barclay\u2019s latest statement is essentially a request for the EU to drop any demand for a backstop in the withdrawal agreement, and let the UK have a transition period without a backstop in place.\n\nThe transition period can be extended by another two years beyond December 2020 with the agreement of both the EU and UK, though the prime minister said earlier this week he had no \u201cintention\u201d to do so.\n\nA European Commission spokesperson told reporters in Brussels on Thursday: \u201cWhat I can confirm is that we have received documents from the UK. On this basis we will have technical discussions today and tomorrow on some aspects of customs, manufactured goods, and sanitary and phytosanitary rules.\n\n\u201cThen the discussions will also take place at political level because Michel Barnier, the commission\u2019s chief negotiator, will meet Steve Barclay tomorrow, on Friday.\u201d", "description": "The EU has set Britain a test it \u201ccannot meet\u201d with its demands to see a replacement for the Irish backstop, the Brexit\u00a0secretary has said.
