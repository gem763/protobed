They were careful until the end, but perhaps not careful enough.\n\nNow, in light of the impeachment inquiry into president Donald Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings, a subtle change in the final version\u2014the work of a dishonest scrivener\u2014could arise in debates over interpretation of Article II, Section 4, the Constitution\u2019s impeachment clause.\n\nAfter months of argument and compromise, the constitutional delegates tasked a style committee with arranging a final draft of the Constitution. Pennsylvania delegate Gouverneur Morris, known as \u201cPenman of the Constitution,\u201d was a key player on the committee. He was also, it seems, a \u201cdishonest scrivener,\u201d according to William Treanor, dean of the Georgetown University Law Center and author of an epic paper outlining Morris\u2019s linguistic treachery and the effects of his textual changes on the law, a work totaling more than 100 pages.\n\nTreanor argues that Morris\u2019s secret handiwork led to 12 subtle but substantive changes to the convention\u2019s approved constitutional text that reflect what he fought for but lost on the debate floor. The textual changes advanced Morris\u2019s constitutional goals, including strengthening the national government, the executive, and the judiciary; protecting private property; and fighting the spread of slavery.\n\nTreanor\u2019s paper explains:\n\nWhile the mandate of the Committee of Style was limited, as drafter for the Committee Gouverneur Morris covertly challenged the results of the convention\u2019s prior proceedings and revised a striking number of fundamentally important constitutional provisions in order to advance his constitutional agenda. He wrote text that could be read to, among other things\u2026expand the range of the presidential impeachment clause.\n\nMorris changes his mind\n\nMorris didn\u2019t start out supporting presidential impeachment at all. Some scholars have argued that, given his positions on the constitutional debate floor, there is no way he would have made changes that make it easier to impeach an American president. But Treanor argues that these scholars ignore the Philadelphia delegate\u2019s changed views.\n\nIn a critical July 20 debate, Morris began by arguing against impeachment because \u201cit will render the Executive dependent on those who will impeach.\u201d But Treanor looks to statements made later that day, after Morris heard arguments for impeachment. The Philadelphia delegate shifted, first agreeing that \u201ccorruption & some other offenses\u2026ought to be impeachable\u201d and then went further, allowing that the executive should be impeachable for treachery, corrupting his electors, and incapacity, among other causes.\n\nMorris ended up making a change to the impeachment clause of the Constitution that Treanor argues is meant to allow for an expansive view of executive impeachment. The version of the clause from the proceedings on the convention referred to the style committee stated: \u201cHe shall be removed from his office on impeachment by the House of Representatives, and conviction by the Senate, for treason or bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors against the United States.\u201d\n\nBut the version the committee produced in the end and was ratified dropped \u201cagainst the United States.\u201d It ends with \u201cother high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d instead. The clause reads: \u201cThe President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nTreanor contends that Morris\u2019s final statement about impeachment, reflecting his changed views during that important July debate, suggests that his removal of \u201cagainst the United States\u201d wasn\u2019t because he thought the phrase was redundant. \u201cRather, he had a capacious view on when impeachment was appropriate, including circumstances like \u2018incapacity\u2019 and being in \u2018foreign pay\u2019 and the modification was consistent with that view,\u201d the dean writes.\n\nMorris went from an opponent of presidential impeachment, fearing it would weaken the leader, to a proponent of a law that would allow for sanctions of an array of unspecified offenses. By removing \u201cagainst the United States,\u201d Morris was arguably ensuring impeachment isn\u2019t just for offenses that betray the nation but also a leader\u2019s office or the people\u2019s trust. \u201cThe question whether this change was legally consequential played a central role in the debate about whether the impeachment of President Clinton was constitutionally permissible, and it has appeared in early debates about possible impeachment of President Trump,\u201d Treanor writes.\n\nThe people\u2019s version\n\nBy the end of the constitutional convention the delegates were exhausted and wanted to get home. They accepted the arrangement that the style committee presented and that\u2019s now the text of the Constitution. Treanor argues that, despite Morris\u2019s treachery, the right thing to do is to view the dishonest scrivener\u2019s version as final because that\u2019s the version \u201cthe people\u201d ratified via their states.\n\nBut in the few Supreme Court cases that have considered the committee\u2019s changes and their legal implications, justices have continually rejected its work as substantive and looked to the text of the proceedings on the constitutional convention instead. Only justice Clarence Thomas prefers turning to the final ratified text, the one Treanor says Morris doctored to advance an ambiguity that reflects his preference for an expansive view of executive impeachment.", "description": "What one framer's centuries-old deceptions could mean for a presidential impeachment.", "authors": ["Ephrat Livni"], "top_image": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gouverneur_Morris-2.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
