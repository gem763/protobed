And leaders of cultural institutions deemed insufficiently patriotic have been condemned or forced from their jobs.\n\nStill, Poland is not yet Hungary, much less Turkey or any other autocratic nation. For most people, life does not feel less free today than it did four years ago.\n\nEarly results, based on exit polls conducted by the research firm Ipsos, showed Law and Justice, which is known as PiS in Polish, with just over 43 per cent of the vote.\n\nThe main opposition bloc, Civic Coalition, had 27.4 per cent. The Left party, representing the country's more liberal wing, had 11.9 per cent. And the Polish People's Party, representing agricultural workers, had 9.6 per cent. The far-right extremist party, Confederation, also appeared to secure enough votes to take up seats in parliament.\n\nOfficial results are to be announced on Tuesday. If the preliminary numbers hold, Law and Justice will be able to form a government without having to assemble a coalition.\n\nThere has always been a certain paranoia at the heart of Law and Justice.\n\nOn Sunday night, Kaczynski was dressed in black. He has dressed in black every day for the past nine years to honour his twin brother, Lech, who died in a plane crash in Smolensk in 2010.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite multiple investigations finding that the crash was caused by bad weather and pilot error, Kaczynski has for years pushed a variety of conspiracy theories and built a cult of martyrdom around his brother that is at the centre of the party's mythology.\n\nEnemies, real and imagined, are a constant presence. In 2015, when the party came to power, migrants - few of whom were actually trying to enter Poland - were made targets. In the months before this election, gay men and lesbians have taken their place in the cross-hairs.\n\nThe two constants of the campaign have been reminders of the government's financial largesse and attacks on what the right-wing news media has labelled \"the rainbow dictatorship\".\n\nKaczynski, widely considered a compelling orator, stood before supporters in his black suit last week and offered a dark vision of the future. Only faith in the Roman Catholic Church could save Poland, he suggested.\n\n\"Everything that is good comes from Christianity,\" he said. Rejecting that truth, he said, would lead to the collapse of civilisation.\n\nThe opposition parties, divided on domestic issues, were not able to come up with a coherent domestic agenda that could compete with the government's sweeping attempts to reshape the economy.\n\nAlthough they mostly avoided infighting, in the months before the election, they largely failed to push a strong enough platform to counter the government's. Their main selling point: They were not Law and Justice.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The party secured its mandate, according to exit polls, by promoting a brand of aggrieved nationalism that resonated in the country's rural heartland and towns that have not kept pace with wealthier cities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4391%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_79%2C$y_66/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3b201b490dd2a122042cdd30383040340010c908", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
