Tottenham\u2019s Double-winning striker Les Allen was at its head.\n\nSon Clive was the PFA Footballer of the Year, while another son \u2014 Bradley \u2014 played at QPR and Grimsby. Their cousin Paul starred at West Ham and Spurs while another cousin, Martin, was at QPR and West Ham and managed Leicester and Barnet.\n\nBut, in a new book, Clive Allen reveals that \u2014 behind all the successes on the field \u2014 a bitter family feud tore them apart off the pitch and left his father Les a stranger to his grandchildren.\n\nClive Allen celebrates after scoring his side's first goal past Coventry in the 1987 FA Cup final\n\nI never thought I\u2019d lead the line at White Hart Lane one more time. About 50 former players and managers had been invited to walk onto the pitch at full-time and there was genuine confusion about how we would be organised.\n\nIt was Sunday, May 14, 2017. The last game at White Hart Lane. Tottenham had beaten Manchester United 2-1 and a farewell ceremony was taking place.\n\nThe booming PA took over: \u2018Please welcome our former players who graced this pitch.\n\n\u2018Our first man scored a record 49 goals in 1987, double footballer of the year \u2014 striker CLIVE ALLEN!\u2019\n\nUp Front by Clive Allen with James Olley will be available on Thursday, October 17 (\u00a320)\n\nThe crowd cheered as I made my way out onto the pitch, waving and smiling to all four corners. What a moment. I\u2019d barely taken 10 strides when the PA continued.\n\n\u2018Talented and industrious, 370 games over eight years, FA Cup winner in 1991, midfielder \u2014 PAUL ALLEN!\u2019\n\nI reached the centre as my cousin Paul took his applause and walked to the other side of a central plinth from which world-renowned tenor Wynne Evans would later sing.\n\n\u2018The scorer of the first goal in that legendary Double season of 1961, striker \u2014 LES ALLEN!\u2019\n\nWith a crutch under his right arm, Dad made his way across the grass as the roll-call continued.\n\nThe emotion of standing next to my Dad and my cousin while being described in those terms overwhelmed me. I looked across at Paul. He smiled back. I looked at Dad. Nothing.\n\nDad scored 27 goals in Spurs\u2019 Double-winning season of 1960-61 and played alongside the legendary Jimmy Greaves before moving to QPR in 1965. Bill Nicholson described Dad as his most dangerous player in the Double team.\n\nAs I began progressing through my teenage years, I became aware of how unique it was to be part of an extended football family.\n\nWhen representing district or county teams, I\u2019d hear people say \u2018Oh, he\u2019s an Allen\u2019 or \u2018His dad was a player\u2019. Carrying the family name became something to overcome. My cousins Paul and Martin had the same hurdle.\n\nClive Allen (far right) stands next to his father Les Allen after the final game at White Hart Lane\n\nAs a young player at QPR in the 1970s I certainly wasn\u2019t given any special favours because of my dad. In fact, I assumed I\u2019d have to work twice as hard for recognition and spent hours practising my finishing with coach Theo Foley.\n\nTheo wouldn\u2019t call me Clive. He preferred \u2018Son of Les\u2019, a phrase he used in my presence for years after I signed. Dad took more of a backseat at this point but we\u2019d already endured some difficult times.\n\nOur relationship was particularly strained when I was about 13 to 15, before I went to QPR as an apprentice. Dad treated me like a young professional and sometimes I came home in tears. My mum, Pat, would always ask me what was wrong and her sympathetic, calming influence was a counter-balance to my Dad\u2019s relentless cajoling.\n\n\u2018This is the way he is,\u2019 she\u2019d say. \u2018He is not being hard on you \u2014 he wants only the best for you.\u2019.\n\nSigning professional terms is a huge moment in anyone\u2019s life but I hadn\u2019t achieved a level he was happy with. After joining QPR, he told me: \u2018Right, it is now down to you.\u2019\n\nHe still watched my games, though, and if he thought I hadn\u2019t played well he wouldn\u2019t have to say anything. I knew. One look would say a thousand words.\n\nIn the back of my mind, my Dad\u2019s words drove me on \u2014 unless you push yourself every minute of every day, you will fail.\n\nYet, regardless of how many goals I scored in a game, Dad would remind me of the wasted chances.\n\nIt has always been complicated. I\u2019m grateful for his guidance but pained by his parenting. Whenever I pushed back or felt I was winning a particular argument, the same line would halt me in my tracks.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s better to be a has-been than a never-was.\u2019\n\nMy Dad\u2019s unrelenting ways caused us to fall out throughout my career. Often it was over the innocuous things. At Tottenham I was given two season tickets and two complimentary tickets for each game \u2014 which I gave to him.\n\nAlthough the seats were virtually the same, he felt he should have been given the season tickets, which my wife Lisa used. This stalemate should have ended around the time my goal-scoring form put me in the mix for the players\u2019 player of the year award. But the situation had grown into something of a stand-off.\n\nIn fact it was the point where my relationship with Mum and Dad began to deteriorate.\n\nClive Allen pictured in the dugout at White Hart during a spell at Spurs caretaker boss in 2007\n\nEven a decade later, after I had finished playing and launched a career in the media, relations were still strained. My older brother Andrew was having personal difficulties. Bradley wasn\u2019t speaking to him much at the time and neither was I.\n\nI\u2019d tried to help him but he\u2019d been pushing me away. Bradley is very black or white on things like this and he\u2019d chosen to give Andrew a wide berth. Living in Grimsby, where he was playing, only distanced him further from the situation.\n\nLisa had spoken to my mum about the domestic tensions and suggested getting everyone together at their house in September 1999 to celebrate Dad\u2019s birthday.\n\nLisa and I turned up with the kids. Andrew had his back to us and didn\u2019t even turn around when we arrived. Bradley and Hayley turned up shortly afterwards and he did the same to them. Bradley couldn\u2019t take it and started calling Andrew out on his behaviour. I backed up Bradley. It went completely pear-shaped after that.\n\nAnd all the while, Dad just let it happen. My son Olly was old enough to understand what happened and after we got the kids back home, he was very upset.\n\nAllen challenges Arsene Wenger during Tottenham's 3-3 draw with Arsenal in 2011\n\nOlly had been seriously ill over the previous two years with a swelling on his optic nerve. He had missed 22 months of school and had spent long periods visiting Great Ormond Street Hospital. I called Dad after this row and told him if Olly relapsed into illness over this, I\u2019d kill him. I didn\u2019t mean it, of course, but I was furious and extremely upset, too.\n\nAn attempt at a reconciliation at Christmas that year fell flat. Dad said he wouldn\u2019t come. Mum took the middle ground by stating she would pop up for a cup of tea but wouldn\u2019t come for lunch.\n\nShe did just that. My sister-in-law Hayley and Lisa had bought angel outfits for the two babies \u2014 our Lydia and Phoebe \u2014 and I think seeing them and chatting about our plans to celebrate the millennium with all our family and friends in a marquee in our garden brought the emotion of the family squabbling home to her.\n\nShe got upset and went to leave. I followed her out onto the driveway. \u2018What\u2019s the matter, Mum?\u2019 I asked. \u2018I\u2019m going to stick by my first love \u2014 and that\u2019s your father!\u2019 I think we both knew at that exact moment that a line in the sand was being drawn.\n\n\u2018Mum, whatever Dad decides, don\u2019t let it stop you coming here. You are always welcome here to see us and the children.\u2019\n\nA rainbow rises in north London as fans invade the White Hart Lane pitch for one last time\n\nFrom that day, Mum came to the odd party over the following few months but then she gradually stopped sending cards at Christmas and birthdays to us and the kids. They had no further contact with us, which is very sad.\n\nUntil that one day at White Hart Lane in 2017, the final match to be played at Tottenham\u2019s old ground.\n\nBefore the game, most of the former players were scattered throughout corporate hospitality having lunch, myself included. My parents were sitting on a table with the Double-winning team alongside Cliff Jones and several others.\n\nIt was an awkward situation as my parents and my children had not been in the same room for many years. I had to tell them.\n\n\u2018Nan and Grandad Allen are over there,\u2019 I said, pointing in their direction. \u2018Yeah, I know,\u2019 said my son Ed. \u2018We went over to say hello.\u2019\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe they had gone over off their own back like that, cutting through years of animosity.\n\n\u2018What happened?\u2019 \u2018Oh, nothing,\u2019 said Ed. \u2018We just said hello, gave them kisses, shook their hands and had a brief, polite conversation.\u2019\n\nI got up and went over to see Mum and Dad. Before I opened my mouth, Mum said: \u2018Who was that charming young man who just came over?\u2019 \u2018That was your grandson.\u2019 She paused, both of them looking confused. \u2018What do you mean?\u2019\n\n\u2018Mum, you know who that was.\u2019 She knew. Of course she knew. I just couldn\u2019t get it. She was in complete denial.\n\nAllen poses for a photo with Martin Allen and Barry Fry at the memorial service for Barry Fry\n\nThis was an opportunity to make a fuss of my kids \u2014 innocent parties in all this \u2014 and break down barriers but she acted as if she didn\u2019t know who they were. It upsets me to this day. The kids did it right. I was incredibly proud of them.\n\nAfter the game, I still exchanged pleasantries with Dad as we were in the tunnel waiting to go out. The crowd cheered as I made my way out onto the pitch, waving and smiling to all four corners. What a moment.\n\nThe applause faded. The current squad with manager Mauricio Pochettino came out to take their applause and Wynne Evans started singing \u2018Glory Glory Hallelujah\u2019.\n\nAs tickertape was fired into the crowd and cheers rang out, nature provided the best special effect of all \u2014 the rain had receded to be replaced by a beautifully bright rainbow over the skyline.\n\nI looked at Dad again. A sensation came over me: in the eye of the celebrations around us, on the pitch we had both played on alongside my cousin with thousands of people celebrating our contribution, I wanted family to come first over football.\n\n\u2018The pitch isn\u2019t bad is it?\u2019 I said. \u2018Yeah, it is beautiful,\u2019 he replied.\n\n\u2018Look at all this,\u2019 I said with a tear in my eye. \u2018We did it.\u2019\n\nDAY KEN BATES FOUGHT WITH DENNIS WISE\n\nPrice tags were never a concern of mine but in January 1992 Chelsea got me cheap at \u00a3250,000. There were big personalities in that dressing room: Andy Townsend, Vinnie Jones, Paul Elliott, Dave Beasant, Steve Clarke, Dennis Wise, Kerry Dixon \u2014 a mainstay striker for so many years.\n\nI was confident I could hit the ground running but the build-up to my first home game, against Manchester United, gave me a snapshot of what I\u2019d walked into.\n\nI was changing next to Kerry and roughly 45 minutes ahead of play, the dressing room door bowled open and in walked Ken [Bates] with his huge fur coat billowing along behind him.\n\nDennis Wise shares a joke with Ken Bates as the pair reunite at Leeds United in 2006\n\n\u2018Right lads\u2026\u2019 he said, before Wisey interrupted.\n\n\u2018What the f***ing hell have you got on?\u2019 he said. I had to remind myself this was the club captain talking to the chairman.\n\n\u2018You are just a little s**t,\u2019 Ken replied before adding: \u2018And I could still knock you out.\u2019\n\nWisey\u2019s eyes widened at that comment. \u2018Come on then, old man!\u2019\n\nAnd they went for each other. Wisey threw Ken on the floor in the middle of the dressing room. Water bottles went flying and as some of the lads were pushed back, a scrap ensued.\n\nI turned to Kerry. \u2018What the f*** is going on here? Do we break it up?\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, no,\u2019 Kerry replied. \u2018Every time he comes into the dressing room they have a wrestle or a fight.\u2019 Eventually one of the backroom staff got involved to break it up. Ken reorganised himself and caught his breath.\n\n\u2018You are still a little s**t,\u2019 he said to Wisey, before turning to leave. \u2018And the rest of you\u2026 you\u2019d better f***ing win today.\u2019\n\nChairmen often come into dressing rooms. That\u2019s commonplace. But a pre-match scrap? Yet Ken loved it. Ken just loved the banter.\n\nUp Front by Clive Allen with James Olley will be available on Thursday, October 17 (\u00a320).", "description": "The Allen family is one of the most celebrated in English football.
