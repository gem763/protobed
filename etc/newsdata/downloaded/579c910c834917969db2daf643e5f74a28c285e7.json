I don\u2019t really care to be honest,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only relevance is Saturday. That\u2019s pretty much about it, it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s had a week off, who\u2019s had a week on, who\u2019s been resting, who hasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll all come down to what happens on kick-off.\u201d\n\nCheika\u2019s Australia knocked England out of their own tournament the last time the two teams met at the World Cup in 2015 but this Wallabies side does not appear to have the same cohesion as the one that reached the final four years ago.\n\nThe laboured 27-8 win over Georgia followed a comeback 39-21 victory over Fiji, a 29-25 tight loss to Wales and a straightforward 45-10 win against lowly-ranked Uruguay.\n\nCheika has tried to make a virtue out of his constant tinkering with the team in Japan but appears no closer to identifying his starter in the key flyhalf position.\n\nChristian Lealiifano, Bernard Foley and Matt To\u2019omua have all had a go with the latter wearing the number 10 shirt against the Georgians.\n\n\u201cI thought he was solid, he gave good direction, it\u2019s his first time there since last year,\u201d Cheika said.\n\n\u201cI thought he gave good direction to the forwards, his chat was good. He was solid in difficult conditions.\n\n\u201cLike every week, I\u2019ll sit down with the selectors, look at the pros and cons of each player according to the team we\u2019re playing that week, and look at the best combination to do that.\u201d", "description": "Wallabies coach Michael Cheika, who has a poor record against England under Eddie Jones and an even poorer record in their off-field wrangles, lobbed the first jibe at his former club mate ahead of their expected World Cup quarter-final clash.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1439940358&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B05Z", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
