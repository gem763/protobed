Our initial focus has been on rebuilding the business and resuming production to secure its future and the livelihoods of the thousands of people we directly employ.\n\nFeronia\u2019s plantations produce crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO). CPO is part of the staple and traditional diet of the Congolese and, with our products sold locally in the DRC, we are well placed to help decrease reliance on imports and increase food security and quality.\n\nFeronia prides itself on being the guardian of our 108 year-old palm oil business and its employees, communities, and environment. We have a long term commitment to improve the living and working environment of our employees and their communities and are committed to sustainable agriculture, environmental protection and community inclusion. Feronia has in place an Environmental and Social Action Plan which is focused on implementing environmental and social best practice and improving social infrastructure.\n\nFeronia is implementing IFC/World Bank standards for environmental and social sustainability. Our oil palm replanting programme is brownfield in nature \u2013 replacing old palms with new \u2013 and it has no reliance on deforestation.\n\nFeronia\u2019s management team has extensive experience in managing both plantations and farming operations in emerging markets.\n\nFor more information please see www.feronia.com\n\nCautionary Notes\n\nExcept for statements of historical fact contained herein, the information in this press release constitutes \u201cforward-looking information\u201d within the meaning of Canadian securities law.
