If I'm not at work, there's no income. A number of people I know who have kids at private schools tell me it's the grandparents who are paying the fees,\" he said.\n\nHe recently took out a policy with School Fee Protect Insurance which opened for business last year as school-fee inflation entered its 10th year of running at twice the rate of wage growth.\n\n\"I am probably over insured but I am concerned. It's not just the fees, it's all the add-ons like laptops, tutors for final year exams. And then there's the way fees come in one hit. I've just been looking at one of my son's fee invoices for next term. It's $11,000,\" Dr Black said.\n\n\"A few years ago I thought I might pay one child's fees all at once. I went to the school and they said you can do that but we'll index right up to year 12 at 5 per cent annually.\"\n\nThe managing director of School Fee Protect Insurance, Johnny Marchant, said he's worked in insurance all his life but the idea to offer protection solely against the inability to pay fees came to him when he saw his own children's fees going through the roof.\n\nHe said the policy was like income insurance or life insurance, \"where you don't have to die to claim\".\n\nHe agreed the market is a small one but the business model was sound enough to be taken on by QBE as an underwriter and Steadfast Group as brokers \u2013 one of the biggest in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In most cases income insurance doesn't cover school fees, and fees are getting incredibly expensive. And we've paid enough claims to know there is job insecurity out there,\" Mr Marchant said.\n\n\"But for 1.3 million people, there is a burning obsession to get their kids through private education. Lots of parents sign up to school fees without any idea how they are going to do it. But they are obsessed.\n\n\"You start off \u2013 and this happened to me \u2013 with one child in year 10 and you're probably paying $10,000 to $15,000. And then the second one starts at school, and before you know where you are, you're up to $30,000 of net income, or $60,000 pre tax.\"\n\nBefore you know where you are, you're up to $30,000 of net income, or $60,000 pre tax. \u2014 Johnny Marchant, School Fee Protect Insurance managing director\n\nThe lumpiness of school fees affects lenders as well. Edstart, which finances school fees, said a lot of its business was smoothing out the peaks and troughs.\n\nChief executive Jack Stevens said borrowing for school fees was more common because of the large sums involved and given a decade of fee inflation runs at double the CPI.\n\nUntil recently, families financed the hit to savings and spread the load across the calendar year since there were few lenders willing to take on the erratic nature of education fees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Banks are not active in this space. School fees are an invoice a semester, to be paid in full. For one family, that might mean over 100 school-fee invoices over a 12-year lifetime. It doesn't fit the normal loan book,\" Mr Steven said.\n\nHe said the healthiest part of his business was allowing parents to pay in instalments, which most bursars did not permit. Some families were extending school-fee repayments up to five years after their child finished year 12.\n\nEdstart earns income from transaction fees on short-term loans and interest on time-extended loans.\n\nMr Marchant said people who pay for education need to have a different frame of reference to other types of spending and borrowing.\n\n\"If your sole reason for private education is to give your kids a good financial future, you're doing it for the wrong reason,\" he said.\n\n\"It has to be about giving them a good mental, physical and emotional education. I mean it has to be balanced.\"", "description": "Parents face hefty fees and not all jobs are secure,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5496%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_511%2C$y_20/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/61e4a9e5dcd4370de9b877ce61ee7f7b726994f5", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
