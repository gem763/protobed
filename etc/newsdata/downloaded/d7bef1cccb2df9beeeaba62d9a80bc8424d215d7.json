When all counted up, they totaled $7,000.\n\nPlatos Closet via WLS\n\nKimes' initial reaction? \"It just scared me,\" she said. \"It made me nervous.\"\n\nSo she immediately put the money in a safe spot in the register, then called her boss, Tammy Wendland.\n\n\"I'm saying to her, 'What did you say? What did you say?'\" Wendland recalled. \"And [she said], 'A very large sum of money.'\"\n\nWLS\n\nWendland contacted the jacket's owner and arranged to return the money to him. Wendland says he told her that he had hidden the money in the coat but forgot he had put it there.\n\n\"He was extremely grateful,\" Wendland said. Just extremely, overwhelmingly grateful.\"\n\nThere was no reward for returning the money, but Wendland said it just felt good to help someone else.\n\n\"Doing the right thing is rewarding intrinsically,\" she said. \"It makes you feel good inside to do the right thing, and there's really nothing as special as feeling good inside.\"\n\nAdded Kimes: \"It's just about integrity. So when you work with things like this, you just have to make sure that you're honest and you do the right thing.\"", "description": "An Indiana man has a clerk in a clothing store to thank for the return of several thousand dollars that he nearly lost in his jacket pocket.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/7k-found-cash2_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
