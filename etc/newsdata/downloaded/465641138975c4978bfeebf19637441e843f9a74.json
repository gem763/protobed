Momentum, in its current phase, is one supporting tool in our instrument box to make that happen.\"\n\nAirbus took a total of 208 million euros ($228 million) in first-half charges related to the Saudi contract, but has declined to put any numbers on the fallout to its cashflow.\n\nThe group is targeting a positive free cashflow before M&A and customer financing of approximately 4 billion euros in 2019 after an outflow of 3.981 billion euros in the first half blamed partly on higher inventories due to delayed jetliner deliveries.\n\nAirbus Defence and Space is the group's second largest division by sales and contributes some 17% of its revenue.\n\nThe division supplies aerial refuelling tankers, satellites and military transport planes, and contributes to the four-nation Eurofighter Typhoon combat jet. It has also partnered with France\u2019s Dassault Aviation (PA: ) to study a successor to the Eurofighter and the French Rafale.\n\nDivisional chief executive Dirk Hoke has urged Berlin to relax the Saudi export ban, saying it will not lead to far-reaching changes in the Gulf kingdom. But Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has said there is no reason to alter the moratorium which has been extended to March next year.", "description": "Exclusive: Airbus defence unit sees cash challenge, adopts efficiency plan", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF980K2_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
