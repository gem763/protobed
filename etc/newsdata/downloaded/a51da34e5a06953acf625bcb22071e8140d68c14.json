Is the team. That\u2019s going to go \u2026 all. The. Way. To the White House!\u201d\n\nYang breezily walked into the chamber building and got onto a packed elevator. To the county party chair squeezed into a corner, Yang excitedly passed along the results of the poll, listing in order the only people who were ahead of him\u2014a former vice president (Joe Biden) and three high-profile senators (Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris).\n\n\u201cAnd then me!\u201d he exclaimed, flashing a goofy, exaggerated smile.\n\nPerhaps you haven\u2019t noticed, but Andrew Yang is \u2026 surging? It sounds crazy, and who knows how long it lasts? But for now he is one of 10 candidates who have qualified through sufficiently robust polling and fundraising for this fall\u2019s third and fourth debates. The exhausting cluster of Oval Office aspirants, at least for these purposes, has been whittled to this: the aforementioned top four, two more senators, a mayor, a former member of Congress and \u2026 this guy. Yang is a 44-year-old entrepreneur from New York and a father of two young sons who\u2019s never run for any office of any kind before this, and whose campaign is fueled by a deeply dystopian view of the near future (trucker riots, anybody?), a pillar of a platform that can come off as a gimmick (a thousand bucks a month for every American adult!), and a zeitgeisty swirl of podcasts, GIFs, tweets and memes. Last week, as a successful governor from a major state dropped out and the bottom half of the bloated field continued to flounder, Yang passed the 200,000 mark for unique donors\u2014outpacing an array of name-known pols. He\u2019s gotten contributions, on average $24 a pop, from 88 percent of the ZIP codes in the country, and he\u2019s on track, he says, to raise twice as much money this quarter as he did last quarter.\n\nIt\u2019s a phenomenon hard to figure\u2014until you get up close and take in some strange political alchemy. At the heart of Yang\u2019s appeal is a paradox. In delivering his alarming, existentially unsettling message of automation and artificial intelligence wreaking havoc on America\u2019s economic, emotional and social well-being, he \u2026 cracks jokes. He laughs easily, and those around him, and who come to see him, end up laughing a lot, too. It\u2019s not that Yang\u2019s doing stump-speech stand-up. It\u2019s more a certain nonchalant whimsy that leavens what he says and does. Sometimes his jokes fall flat. He can be awkward, but he also pointedly doesn\u2019t appear to care. It\u2019s weird, and it\u2019s hard to describe, but I suspect that if Yang ever said something cringeworthy, as Jeb Bush did that time in 2016\u2014\u201cPlease clap\u201d\u2014the audience probably would respond with mirth, not pity. Critics ding his ambit of proposals as fanciful or zany (getting rid of the penny, empowering MMA fighters, lowering the voting age to 16) and question the viability of his \u201cFreedom Dividend,\u201d considering its sky-high price tag (\u201cexciting but not realistic,\u201d Hillary Clinton decided when she considered the general notion in the 2016 cycle). And his campaign coffers are chock-full of small-number contributors and even $1 donors. Still, at this angry, fractious time, and in this primary that\u2019s already an edgy, anxious slog, Yang and his campaign somehow radiate an ambient joviality. Of his party\u2019s presidential contestants, he\u2019s the cheerful doomsayer.\n\nHis most foolproof laugh line\u2014\u201cthe opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math\u201d\u2014suggests that his candidacy is premised on distinguishing himself from the president the same way as his fellow challengers. But it\u2019s not quite that simple. He\u2019s attracting support from an unorthodox jumble of citizens, from a host of top technologists, but from penitent Trump voters, too. He\u2019s one of only two Democrats (along with Sanders) who ticks 10 percent or higher when Trump voters are asked which of the Democrats they might go for\u2014a factoid Yang uses as evidence that he\u2019ll win \u201ceasy\u201d if he\u2019s the nominee come November of next year. Trump, of course, is the president, and Yang (let\u2019s not get carried away) remains a very long long shot to succeed him.\n\nBut to spend any time with Yang is to grapple with this unexpected Trump-Yang Venn diagram. While Yang talks in different, far less overtly divisive ways, identifies different scapegoats (robots, not immigrants) and offers different solutions (cash, not walls), he\u2019s zeroed in on the same elemental problem Trump did en route to his shock of a win in \u201916: A large portion of the populace is being left behind, and it\u2019s not remotely OK. Similarly, Yang\u2019s campaign packs an anti-Washington, convention-bucking, on-the-fly, filter-free vibe. There are four-letter hats\u2014not MAGA, but MATH (Make America Think Harder). And his Trump train? It\u2019s the Yang Gang. Yang is not the not Trump of the 2020 trail. \u201cYang is the new Trump,\u201d a traveling Trump-voter-turned-Yang-Gang-YouTuber told me.\n\nSupporters for Andrew Yang hold signs June 27 in Miami. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO\n\nThere are plenty of differences, too, of course. To wit: In the chamber building, after the elevator disgorged a floor up, a lobby was filled with the bouncy beats of line dancing emanating from a different room. One of his staffers joked that Yang should join in. And then \u2026 he did. Apparently unafraid of looking silly, or potentially creating an embarrassing, indelible, campaign-altering moment with the presence not just of me but also a state-based reporter from The Associated Press, Yang proceeded to team up with a handful of senior citizens for what most onlookers ultimately agreed was a quite credible, rhythm-keeping rendition of the catchy \u201cCupid Shuffle.\u201d\n\n\u201cDown, down, do your dance, do your dance,\u201d went the lyrics\u2014and Yang did.\n\n\u201cGet it, Andrew!\u201d the group leader called into her microphone. \u201cLookin\u2019 good!\u201d\n\nWhen it was over, Yang jogged around the room to hearty cheers, grinning and giving everybody high fives.\n\n\u201cThanks for letting me crash your class,\u201d he said to the head of Family Slide Dancers.\n\n\u201cThank you all!\u201d he said to the members of her class.\n\nBy the time we got back to the Suburban, my phone was buzzing nonstop in my pocket. A tweet of the video I shot was starting to zoom around the internet.\n\nSomething that just happened here is @AndrewYang did Jazzercise. pic.twitter.com/0p9LLebvTG \u2014 Michael Kruse (@michaelkruse) August 15, 2019\n\n***\n\n\u201cWe are basically fucked,\u201d Yang said, sitting in the Suburban, earlier in the day, not too long after we met, \u201cunless we un-fuck ourselves, systematically and collectively.\u201d\n\nThis blunt declaration didn\u2019t surprise me. That\u2019s because I\u2019d read his most recent book. It\u2019s one heck of a downer.\n\nIn The War on Normal People, which came out last year, Yang sketched a stark picture of \u201cbroken people\u201d and \u201cjobless zones\u201d and \u201cderelict buildings\u201d and \u201cwidespread despair\u201d and \u201chundreds of thousands of families and communities being pushed into oblivion\u201d and \u201ca society torn apart by ever-rising deprivation and disability\u201d and a \u201cbest-case scenario\u201d of \u201ca hyper-stratified society like something out of The Hunger Games.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that we may already be too defeated and opiated by the market to mount a revolution. We might just settle for making hateful comments online and watching endless YouTube videos with only the occasional flare-up of violence amid many quiet suicides,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThe group I worry about most is poor whites,\u201d he added. \u201cThere will be more random mass shootings in the months ahead as middle-aged white men self-destruct and feel that life has no meaning.\u201d\n\nMy copy of his book is littered with my disconsolate scribbles.\n\n\u201cYikes.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 bleak \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 hellscape.\u201d\n\nKnow what else, though, I penned into the margins?\n\n\u201cHa!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was 13,\u201d Yang wrote, for instance, \u201cI had to have four teeth pulled in preparation for wearing braces. I was actually kind of excited about it because I saw my dad\u2019s teeth and was like, \u2018whatever it takes, let\u2019s not have those.\u2019\u201d He said the answer for out-of-place workers was not a career as a home health care aide because \u201cformer truck drivers will not be excited to bathe grandma.\u201d\n\nAnd as we traveled around, a busy, six-stop day in this sweaty, marshy terrain\u2014from Bluffton to Okatie to Beaufort, from town halls to meet-and-greets with local Democratic clubs to a quiet, private stop at a shelter for abused women and children\u2014the laughter never stopped for long.\n\nNibbling on a belVita vanilla oat biscuit, he praised the company for marketing the product as a healthy option. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, you\u2019re clearly good for me,\u201d he said, \u201cand then it\u2019s a fucking cookie for breakfast!\u201d\n\nHe referred repeatedly to his $24 average donation. \u201cMy fans are cheaper than Bernie\u2019s!\u201d\n\nEntering a Mexican restaurant for a town hall, he said, \u201cThe best thing about running for president is I walk into a room and people clap!\u201d The crowd roared.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t always this way. His parents came to America from Taiwan. His mother was a computer services administrator before becoming a pastel artist. His father grew up poor on a peanut farm and got a Ph.D. in physics at the University of California at Berkeley and worked for General Electric and IBM in New York. Yang described him as a \u201cworkaholic\u201d and \u201ca brusque lab geek.\u201d Growing up in the suburbs of Westchester County, Yang as a kid was \u201cangsty,\u201d \u201cbrooding\u201d and \u201csad,\u201d he said. He read science fiction and fantasy and Herman Hesse and listened to Pearl Jam and Soundgarden and Sarah McLachlan and played piano and decent tennis and lots of Dungeons and Dragons. He was, for a time, a tad goth. He suffered racist slurs. At prep school at Phillips Exeter in New Hampshire, and then at college at Brown, where he majored in economics and political science, he began to come out of his shell. He started to lift weights, mostly to try to get dates, and was proud to be able to bench press 225 pounds eight to 10 times in a row.\n\nNow, here in the Suburban, as we crossed the Broad River, I brought up \u201cRex and Lex.\u201d That\u2019s what Yang named his pecs, \u201cRex\u201d for the right, \u201cLex\u201d for the left, when he was lifting all those weights. I knew about this because he wrote about in his other, earlier book, Smart People Should Build Things. He \u201ccould jostle them on command,\u201d he had written, \u201cto make them \u2018talk.\u2019\u201d Obviously, I wanted to hear more.\n\nYang obliged. Having shed his blue sport coat, he looked down at his chest, and he \u2026 channeled \u201cRex.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s, like, almost mute,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he\u2019s still like\u201d\u2014and here the candidate for president made his dad-bod-dormant pectoralis undulate under his checked, collared shirt and assumed a diminutive, sing-song cadence\u2014\u201c\u2018Andrew, I still have a little bit of voice left. You haven\u2019t fed me in a long time. You used to looooove meeeeeee.\u2019\u201d\n\nZach Graumann, Yang\u2019s 31-year-old campaign manager, looked some combination of mesmerized and mortified. \u201cYou\u2019re such a tool,\u201d he said.\n\nYang was undeterred. He was on a roll. He turned his attention to \u201cLex.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh man,\u201d he lamented, \u201cLex is wimpier than Rex!\u201d\n\nEverybody inside the Suburban laughed and laughed.\n\n\n\n***\n\nAt the town hall in Hilton Head\u2014a standing-room-only crowd of mainly older folks wearing boat shoes and flip-flops\u2014it was hard to miss the young guys in the pink hats.\n\nThey listened intently as Yang introduced himself. \u201cHello, everyone! I\u2019m Andrew Yang, and I\u2019m running for president! \u2026 I\u2019m going to be honest. I\u2019m the last person anyone thought was going to run for president, in terms of my high school, my upbringing. My parents were not like, \u2018You\u2019re gonna be president someday.\u2019\u201d This assertion drew laughs. After Brown and law school at Columbia and five unhappy months as a corporate attorney, he started a company (Stargiving.com) that failed, he said. He was the CEO of a company that succeeded. He launched a non-profit that did a little bit of both. Then Yang gave his political pitch, about truckers, and soon-to-be self-driving trucks, and so many other kinds of workers, and automation, and artificial intelligence, and the real reason he thinks Trump won\u2014millions of jobs automated away in the most important Midwest swing states\u2014and the coming \u201cbuzz saw\u201d and \u201cthe race to the bottom\u201d and \u201csuicides, drug overdoses, anxiety, depression,\u201d and how the average American life expectancy has declined for three straight years for the first time in a century, and how \u201cD.C. is not up to it at all,\u201d and about $1,000 a month for every adult.\n\n\u201cHow am I doing so well?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because Americans recognize the truth when they hear it.\u201d\n\nThe guys in the pink hats were impressed.\n\n\u201cHe nailed it,\u201d Mike Gallagher, 29, told me after Yang finished.\n\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d said Wayne Boyce, 28.\n\nThey had driven the hour or so up from Savannah, Georgia, and both of them said they had voted for Trump but would not be doing it again.\n\nDitto for their other friend. \u201cHe\u2019s an asshole,\u201d Jordan Snipes said of the president. \u201cAnd he hasn\u2019t done anything he said he was going to do.\u201d\n\nThey were members, they all said, of the Yang Gang now.\n\nI asked if there were others like them where they\u2019re from.\n\n\u201cMost of our friends,\u201d Snipes reported.\n\nAP Images\n\nA few hours later, at the Mexican restaurant, I met the Yang Gang YouTuber. Russell Peterson, 43, from Union County, North Carolina, was with his wife, Elasa, who was wearing a MATH shirt, and their toddler son, Zephaniah\u2014\u201ccountry folks,\u201d Peterson said, and \u201cformer Trump supporters.\u201d He had a lot to say.\n\n\u201cWe all saw a problem, and that\u2019s why we elected Donald Trump,\u201d he told me. \u201cBecause he was saying he was going to go in and he was going to drain the swamp. He was a larger-than-life figure, you know? We all knew that there was a problem. We just didn\u2019t know what that problem was. But then, when you listen to Andrew Yang, you realize: Oh, yeah, it is automation\u2014it\u2019s not immigrants. It\u2019s automation. We\u2019re all losing our jobs. We\u2019re all being phased out. I\u2019m an ex-landscaper. I just saw yesterday they\u2019ve got a mower that just goes and mows your yard, just like a Roomba, you know, does your house.\u201d\n\nAnd what\u2019s he do for work now?\n\n\u201cThis is what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe follow Andrew Yang full-time.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t work for the campaign, but \u2026\n\n\u201cThis has become my passion. There is nothing more important than getting this man elected,\u201d he said, breaking down his video equipment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of politicians. I don\u2019t want a politician. I want somebody who\u2019s going to tell me the fuckin\u2019 truth, tell me what\u2019s going on, and then provide something that\u2019s actually going to impact my life! Since I\u2019ve been an adult, there\u2019s not been one politician that has directly impacted my life, but I promise you that freedom dividend and putting $2,000 a month into my household would directly impact my life. I mean, game over.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t finished.\n\n\u201cPeople are so disillusioned,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump? He was the WWE superstar guy. You know, he was going to take his metal chair into Washington, and he was just going to use it on everybody. We were finally going to be working like we were supposed to be working\u2014and I\u2019ve only seen the country get more and more divided. And then when you have Trump acting like he\u2019s acting, I can\u2019t support that, bro\u2019. And then there\u2019s a lot of people in the center who are like me who are moving over to Andrew Yang because we don\u2019t like what we see. We don\u2019t like what Trump has done to the country. He\u2019s only divided us more and more. So now we actually have some solutions and a guy who\u2019s talking about solutions\u2014so, like, let\u2019s get this guy in, because he makes too much damn sense!\u201d\n\nAll day long, everywhere we went, Yang was asked about Trump. How was he going to handle him? How was he going to debate him? How was he going to beat him?\n\nHe said he \u201cwould make him seem ridiculous.\u201d He said he \u201cwould just diminish him by dismissing his arguments and making him seem like the buffoon and joke that he is.\u201d He said Trump was \u201cfire\u201d\u2014and he said he was \u201cice.\u201d He told people he was on the debate team in high school that went to the world championships in London. He said he would \u201cuse humor.\u201d\n\nAnd at the last stop of the day, here at the Grand Army of the Republic Hall, outside of which I spotted parked a red Ford F250 pickup truck with a bumper sticker that read TRUMP, the throng of a couple hundred that had gathered couldn\u2019t fit inside. They spilled out onto the lawn off to the side. \u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d Yang hollered. He had no microphone. \u201cLet\u2019s project!\u201d\n\nAnd at this last event the last question was about Trump.\n\n\u201cWhen you become the nominee,\u201d a woman asked, \u201chow will you stand up to that nastiness in the White House?\u201d\n\n\u201cVoters around the country have said to me they cannot wait to see me debate Donald Trump,\u201d Yang said. He was all about \u201clogic and reason and problem-solving\u201d while Trump was \u201call bluster, and Americans can tell the difference very quickly,\u201d he said, snapping his fingers. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason he hasn\u2019t touched me,\u201d Yang continued. \u201cBecause he knows I\u2019m the wrong person to touch. His supporters are all coming my way. \u2026 I\u2019m peeling off Trump supporters right and left.\u201d And one more thing: \u201cI\u2019m better at the internet than he is!\u201d\n\nMore laughter.\n\n\u201cOn that note \u2026\u201d\n\nA snaking line of people waited for pictures. The sun set. Through the buggy, muggy haze, a single orange orb of a streetlight glowed past clumps of spectral Spanish moss. Yang autographed MATH hats. Flashes from phones pulsed in the dark.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story gave an incorrect date of Andrew Yang\u2019s first appearance on a Sunday news program.
