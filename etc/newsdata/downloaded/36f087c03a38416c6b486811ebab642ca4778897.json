But a judge in London refused the request, telling Assange that the next preliminary hearing will take place as planned on December 19 with a full extradition hearing in February, the Guardian reported.\n\nWhen asked by the judge, Vanessa Baraitser, if he understood what was happening in court, Assange said: \u201cNot really.
