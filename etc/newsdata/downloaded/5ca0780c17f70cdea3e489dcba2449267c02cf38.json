Americans, he said, are already seeing the effects of speedy technological advancement.\n\n\u201cTheir Main Street stores are closing. They see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonalds, every grocery store, every CVS,\" he said at the debate in Ohio. \"Driving a truck is the most common job in 29 states, including this one; 3.5 million truck drivers in this country. And my friends in California are piloting self-driving trucks.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile some of Warren\u2019s plans acknowledge the role of automation, she has dismissed it as the primary driver of job loss.\n\n\u201cThe data show that we\u2019ve had a lot of problems with losing jobs, but the principal reason has been bad trade policy. The principal reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations who\u2019ve been calling the shots on trade,\u201d she said at the debate.\n\nWarren argues that empowering workers on both corporate boards and in trade negotiations would help alleviate those problems.\n\nFollowing the debate, The Associated Press issued a fact check siding with Yang, pointing to one study from Ball State University in 2015 that attributed some 88 percent of manufacturing job losses to automation.\n\n\u201cEconomists mostly blame those job losses on automation and robots, not trade deals. So the Massachusetts senator is off,\u201d the AP Fact Check wrote.\n\nWhile members of the \u201cYang Gang,\u201d Yang\u2019s devoted online supporters, expressed glee at the report, labor economists and experts took issue with the AP ruling, issuing their own fact checks on the news wire.\n\n\u201cThat fact check strikes me as incorrect,\u201d said Melissa S. Kearney, a University of Maryland economist who along with Katharine G. Abraham co-authored a comprehensive review of factors behind employment loss.\n\nThe paper, published last year with the National Bureau of Economic Research, found that two of the top factors affecting job loss were \u201cincreased import competition from China and the penetration of robots into the labor market,\u201d but found competition from China had more than double the effect of automation.\n\nNoah Smith, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, argued that the Ball State study cited by AP was \u201cof much lower quality than research showing a big impact from China.\u201d\n\n\u201cAP Fact Check got this one wrong,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nIn a statement to The Hill, the AP said it stood by its story.\n\nNobel Laureate Paul Krugman assailed both Yang\u2019s position and the AP fact check in a New York Times column, pleading with Democrats not to \u201cgo down the robot rabbit hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs it happens, Warren was more right than the supposed fact-checkers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs far as I can tell, [Yang is] offering an inadequate solution to an imaginary problem, which is in a way kind of impressive,\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKrugman argued that the effect of technological change on jobs is no different today than it has been at any other time in modern history, noting that similar anxieties existed about machines taking away farmers\u2019 jobs. While technology did cause the share of the jobs devoted to agriculture to drop precipitously in the last 80 years, he noted, better, higher-level jobs replaced them.\n\nIn response to criticism from Krugman on the same issue in June, Yang pointed to the low level of labor force participation.\n\nFormer Maryland Rep.

Innovation always displaces AND creates jobs, that's how progress works. What we need is massive public investment in workers and infrastructure to manage change,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nBut while the experts seemed to side more closely with Warren, they didn\u2019t let her off the hook completely either.\n\nThe primary culprit in trade-related job loss, they said, was China, which upended the global economic order when it began to open up its economy and joined the World Trade Organization in the 2001.\n\n\u201cI want to be clear that it\u2019s not to say that trade writ large is bad, but the experience of the last 20 years, with China in particular, has led to employment loss,\u201d said Kearney.\n\nRecent studies, she noted, have shown that the shock of China\u2019s economic boom and integration into the global economy has begun to recede.\n\nErnie Tedeschi, a managing director and policy economist for Evercore ISI, argues that although the U.S. lost some jobs to Mexico following the North American Free Trade Agreement, the deal actually helped prevent deeper job losses by giving U.S.-based companies a reason to stay put instead of relocating entirely to China.\n\nWhile there is still a robust academic debate, he said, research seems to indicate that automation has had more of an effect on wages than on the number of jobs.\n\n\u201cAutomation has probably allowed output and profits of firms to grow faster than pay has,\u201d he said.\n\nThe debate shows no signs of cooling off.\n\nZach Moller, deputy director of the economic program at Third Way, a think tank argued that policy-makers should instead focus on how to help workers, regardless of what\u2019s behind it, floating a new look at unemployment compensation and skills training.\n\n\u201cIf you ask the worker who lost their job, I don't think they care whether they lost the job from a robot or outsourcing,\u201d he said. \"They care how they will support their family.\"", "description": "Sen.
