Against the yen it was 0.1% lower at 106.84.\n\nHedge funds have added to their massive long dollar positions, which rose in the latest week to a nine-week high, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday..\n\n\n\n\n\nThe euro remains out of favour, the data showed, with bearish bets on the currency climbing sharply.\n\nThe latest data appeared to justify the pessimism, with German industrial orders falling more than expected in August on weaker domestic demand -- clear evidence that a manufacturing slump is pushing Europe's largest economy into recession.\n\nThe euro traded as low as $1.0964 but held off 2-1/2-year lows of $1.0879 last Tuesday.\n\nThe Chinese yuan fell 0.3% to 7.13 per dollar in offshore trade. There was no onshore trading as China is still on break for its national day. Gallo said the clouds over the dollar offered some support to the yuan.\n\n\"If things break down this week, I don't think you will see dollar/yuan above 7.20 on that headline,\" he added.\n\nOther trade-exposed currencies such as the Australian dollar and the Korean won also fell, with the former losing a quarter percent and the won down 0.4%.\n\nSterling slipped 0.2% to around $1.23, with only a few weeks until UK's scheduled exit from the European Union on Oct. 31.\n\n(Reporting by Sujata Rao; additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo and Tom Westbrook in Singapore; Editing by Kim Coghill)", "description": "The dollar edged up on Monday after four straight losses last week, while China's offshore yuan and the euro were undermined by fresh jitters on the trade war front and data that added to evidence of economic recession in Germany.
