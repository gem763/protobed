And as the clock ticks down to zero hour, it\u2019s becoming obvious to everyone that it won\u2019t be a hop, skip and a jump into the promised land of milk and honey, but rather a full on leap into the screaming void.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what the \u201cdeal\u201d the prime minister will bring home looks like yet, but we do know two things.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFirstly, the deal won\u2019t satisfy the Brexit extremists in the Conservative Party \u2013 the walking, talking dinosaurs that are holding their own prime minister and our country to ransom. Secondly, we know it is not what people thought they were voting for when they voted in the Brexit referendum two years ago.\n\nThe Brexit vote was a clear signal to the elites, to the failed political class, that something has been going badly wrong in this country. Years of austerity, of welfare sanctions, of public services and local government cut to the bone, and a growing divide between the political class and the rest of the country, have split us down the middle. Divided and angry, looking for something \u2013 anything \u2013 better than what we have.\n\nBut the Brexit the politicians are delivering will do nothing to solve those problem or heal the grievances people rightly feel. It\u2019s not a panacea \u2013 it\u2019s a looming disaster for our country. Nobody voted for a Brexit that would see the NHS cut staff, that would drive up the cost of living yet further, or would tear apart families, friends and neighbours.\n\nMeanwhile, the politicians are preparing the way they know best: Michael Gove is planning a Britain after Brexit where citizens are effectively encouraged to trawl through rubbish dumps looking for anything of value, while Liam Fox apparently wants us to be able to import food contaminated with rat faeces and crushed insects as the price to pay for doing a trade deal with Donald Trump.\n\nIt would be funny if it wasn\u2019t true.\n\nIf I wrote this stuff for TV, incredulous commissioning editors would laugh at me. But the zealots in government who want Brexit are putting their desire for a grip and grin in the Oval Office above the protections and benefits being a member of the EU provide us all.\n\nI\u2019m a Labour man, but even I feel a bit sorry for Theresa May. Torn between her desire to get a good deal, but having to satisfy the ideological cravings of a small political elite in her own party who read too much Ayn Rand at university and want to play out their fantasy politics in the sandbox of Britain, she is leading us down the path to a bad deal or no deal \u2013 a lose-lose for everyone.\n\nBrexit might be a big deal, but it\u2019s certainly not a done deal. The momentum is with the campaign for a Final Say.\n\nAll summer long, people have been coming to marches and rallies across the country. The trade unions, parts of the Labour Party and all manner of organisations and individuals have thrown their weight behind a People\u2019s Vote as the only viable solution to the self-harm of a botched Brexit.\n\nI support the people having a Final Say on Brexit through a People\u2019s Vote. More than 100,000 people marched through London in June calling for a People\u2019s Vote, and even more are expected this Saturday.\n\nAlong with many others, I\u2019ve paid for coaches to bring people from across the UK to London in what could be the biggest march in a generation. That democratic will \u2013 that public demand \u2013 cannot simply be ignored or written off.\n\nA People\u2019s Vote is not about ignoring the will of the people or downplaying the democratic decision of 2016. Democracy is ongoing, not a one-off event. But if it\u2019s a bad deal \u2013 if it harms our country, damages our economy or hurts working people \u2013 then we must have the opportunity to scrutinise that deal and make our voice heard.\n\nThis is too important for politicians alone to decide. That\u2019s why I support a People\u2019s Vote so the people have a final say on whatever Brexit deal Theresa May comes back with. Let\u2019s step back from the edge and not rush into the void. Let\u2019s decide our own future.\n\nSteve Coogan is an actor, screenwriter and comedian", "description": "Brexit Day is just over 150 days away.
