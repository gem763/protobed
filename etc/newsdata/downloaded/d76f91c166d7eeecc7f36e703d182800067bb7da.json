Presidential tickets needed at least 1.5 percent of the vote to make it to the first round on October 27. At that point, 45 percent is needed for an outright win, or 40 percent with a 10-point lead. Should neither occur, a runoff takes place November 24.\n\nWhich candidates make it to the first round?\n\nWith 47.7 percent of the vote, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and his running mate Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner of Everyone\u2019s Front coalition came out more than 15 points ahead of President Mauricio Macri and Miguel \u00c1ngel Pichetto of the Together for Change coalition. The latest polls prior to the PASO underestimated the difference, suggesting instead a single-digit win for Fern\u00e1ndez. Voter turnout hit 75 percent, similar to during the 2015 PASO election. As the chart below indicates, four tickets fell short of reaching the 1.5 percent minimum needed to proceed to the first round.\n\nWhich provinces held elections and what are the results?\n\nThree provinces also held gubernatorial primaries at the local level. In Buenos Aires province, Axel Kiciloff of Everyone\u2019s Front came in ahead of current Governor Mar\u00eda Eugenia Vidal of Together for Change, receiving 49.3 percent and 32.6 percent respectively. Meanwhile, in the City of Buenos Aires, current Mayor Horacio Rodr\u00edguez Larreta of Together for Change received 46.5 percent, ahead of his Everyone\u2019s Front opponent Mat\u00edas Lammens at 32.0 percent. In the northwestern province of Catamarca, Everyone\u2019s Front Ra\u00fal Jalil earned 59.2 percent, compared to 25.7 percent for Together for Change\u2019s Roberto G\u00f3mez 25.7 percent.\n\nA gubernatorial election took place in the southern province of Santa Cruz. Everyone\u2019s Front\u2019s Alicia Kirchner won reelection with over 58.6 percent of the vote, beating Eduardo Costa representing Together for Change with 32.1 percent.", "description": "Six tickets made it past the primary to vie for the presidency.
