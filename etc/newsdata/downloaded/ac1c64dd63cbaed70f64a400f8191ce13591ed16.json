And though fans haven\u2019t even watched the first episode of the celebrity singing competition\u2019s second season \u2014 \u2019cause we\u2019re not counting that sneak-peek special \u2014 the team behind the show is already looking ahead to the future, seeing as the smash-hit show was renewed for a third season back in May.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to prep for Season 3,\u201d executive producer Craig Plestis, who developed the South Korean game show into its U.S. format for Fox, told TheWrap. \u201cAnd you know, it\u2019s a lot of learning what we did on Season 2 and building on that and also having some really big, unexpected surprises, especially in the Super Bowl episode.\u201d\n\nYes, Season 3 premiere has landed the highly coveted post-Super Bowl slot at Fox on Sunday, Feb. 2.\n\nAlso Read: 'Masked Singer' Premiere: Ken Jeong Thinks Egg Is a 'Queer Eye' Star - Everyone Else Does Not (Exclusive Video)\n\n\u201cI think what we have right now will blow America away when that happens,\u201d Plestis added. \u201cAnd it will be an organic evolution of everything you see here on Season 2. So everything is a building block and everything is kind of mapped out like a good puzzle. We have a roadmap overall of how we want to change things and make it better and fun and different from anything you\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nPlestis\u2019 endgame in all of this is to create a global competition for the adaptations of \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d that have premiered or are being developed in other countries, including the OG in South Korea, as well as the UK, Australia, Mexico, Greece, South Africa, Thailand and more.\n\nAlso Read: Final 'Masked Singer' Season 2 Costume Revealed - Meet Ladybug (Photo)\n\n\u201cWhat I hope is three years from now we\u2019ll still be on the air, knock on wood, and all these other shows will pop up and be successful as well and that we\u2019ll eventually have a worldwide competition once a year a la \u2018Eurovision\u2019 of \u2018the Masked Singer,'\u201d Plestis told us. \u201cAnd every country can bring one of their own masks and we\u2019d make it gigantic and a world event once a year. But first we have to get through this couple seasons before we get to that (laughs).\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s in store for Season 2 then? Well, for one, Plestis says panelists Jenny McCarthy, Ken Jeong, Robin Thicke and Nicole Scherzinger have upped their guessing game.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a lot better,\u201d Plestis promised us. \u201cBut in truth, they have no clue at all. It\u2019s like a military camp, is how we try to keep it. We keep all the secrets from them, and trust me, they want to know. They don\u2019t want to look like fools to America. So trust me, they\u2019re trying really hard. But we\u2019re also trying really hard as producers to make it difficult for them to guess. And sometimes they do guess correctly, but there are many times that no one guessed at all.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Watch Homer Simpson Cross Over Onto 'The Masked Singer' in New Fox Promo (Exclusive Video)\n\n\u201cAnd that goes to the power of our performers making it really difficult with the way they sing,\u201d Plestis said. \u201cIt might be a very famous singer who is disguising their voice even when they\u2019re singing. So you have to pay really close attention this season. The Masked Singers have really upped their game, as well as everyone else.\u201d\n\nThe 16 contestants competing on Season 2 include The Egg, The Penguin, The Panda, The Butterfly, The Leopard, The Flamingo, The Skeleton, The Fox, The Eagle, The Ice Cream, The Tree, The Rottweiler, The Black Widow, The Flower, The Ladybug and Thingamajig.\n\nAccording to Fox, \u201ccollectively, all of the Season Two undercover celebrities have amassed 69 Emmy Award nominations, 42 Grammy Award nominations, 22 Broadway shows, three New York Times best-sellers and two have been named Time magazine\u2019s Most Influential People.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can say truly there are some unexpected names that did this show this season that I still think, \u2018I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re doing our show,'\u201d Plestis said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never been in another type of show like this ever and I could just never imagine them doing it. But it\u2019s because of this feel-good nature of the show and wanting to challenge themselves and just try something new and different that you wouldn\u2019t get from doing any kind of other reality show.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d Season 2 premieres with a two-hour episodes tonight, Wednesday, at 8/7c on Fox.\n\nRead original story \u2018Masked Singer\u2019 Producer Wants the Show to Do an Annual \u2018Eurovision\u2019-Style Worldwide Competition At TheWrap", "description": "\u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d returns to Fox with a supersized two-hour Season 2 premiere tonight.
