Bugatti says it is the first production auto manufacturer to make a car that has exceeded 300 miles per hour.\n\nChanges were made to the Chiron's body to improve its aerodynamcs for very high speeds.\n\nOnly 30 of these cars will be made and the price, considering that this is a record-setting Bugatti, is surprisingly low. The Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ will cost just $3.9 million. That's less than $1 million more than the standard Bugatti Chiron, which costs about $3.2 million. It's also much less than some of Bugatti's recent limited edition models, like the Divo, which costs $6 million, and the Centodieci , which goes for $9 million. Only 10 of the Centodieci will be made. There's also La Voiture Noire , of which only one will ever be made for a cost of $19 million, including taxes, making it the most expensive new car ever sold.\n\nThe 16-cylinder engine in the Super Sport 300+, although largely the same as the one in the Chiron, is tuned to produce 1600 horsepower, 100 more than the base car. (It's worth noting that these are European horsepower measurements. Horsepower figures, as calculated in the US, are slightly lower.)\n\nBugatti worked with the race car manufacturer Dallara to create a special version of the Chiron.\n\nTo optimize aerodynamics, the Super Sport 300+ has a longer body than the standard Chiron. The exhaust pipes have also been repositioned to improve air flow past the back of the car.\n\nRead More", "description": "You will soon be able to buy a car that can go over 300 miles an hour, assuming you can find somewhere safe to do that.", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190909103928-02-bugatti-chiron-super-sport-300-plus-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
