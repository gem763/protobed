I feel that sepsis was never considered as a diagnosis.\"\n\nThe advertising executive, who also has a nine-year-old son called Finnley, continued: \"I also feel that time was wasted in treating Shay from when he first time he arrived at Rotherham Hospital to before he was transferred to Sheffield Children's Hospital.\n\n\"I have to know whether the amount of insulin caused or contributed to his death, which I believe it did. He was in a compromised position and therefore was less likely to cope with the overdose.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n\"I feel incredibly letdown by the hospital by the manner in which they treated my son.\n\n\"The family have been left devastated, destroyed, heartbroken by the loss of Shay.\n\n\"We relive every moment of his death and it's left a huge void in our hearts. The amount of joy, love and laughter he brought us in five years is immeasurable.\n\n\"Now we are living in a nightmare we will never wake from. We are a shadow of our former selves.\"\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nShay was transferred to Sheffield Children's Hospital in March last year but his condition deteriorated rapidly.\n\nHis stomach became swollen and, after he underwent surgery to remove his bowels, a CT scan showed he had suffered the brain injury.\n\nLaura and husband Martyn, 29, a gas engineer, sat beside their 'happy\u201d boy and turned the machines off on April 3 \u2013 four days after he was first admitted.\n\nShay's autopsy report said he died from multiple organ failure from an unknown cause leading to a bowel infection and causing sepsis.\n\nGiving evidence, consultant forensic neuropathologist Dr Daniel du Plessis said Shay's brain injury was caused by a lack of blood and oxygen supply after admission to hospital but ruled out trauma.\n\nThe neuropathologist told an inquest that it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that Shay's brain damage was caused by the insulin over-dosage.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nDr du Plessis said it was difficult to pinpoint when the youngster's hypoxic brain injury developed but admitted that multiple organ failure \u201ccontributed substantially\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have no doubt that there was an excess of insulin given but it would appear that it was not long enough and severe enough to cause significant brain damage.\n\n\u201cThere was no evidence the brain damage was a result of an over-dosage of insulin.\u201d\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nGiving evidence, forensic pathologist Charles Wilson described the insulin over-dosage as a \u201cred herring\u201d and there was no evidence it significantly contributed to Shay's death.\n\nMr Wilson initially said Shay died from multiple organ failure due to shock from an unknown causation.\n\nBut after being asked again by the coroner, Mr Wilson said he could not argue that sepsis was the possible cause of the organ failure and that he would be happy to change the cause of death.\n\nAn inquest, which is likely to last five days, continues.", "description": "Shay Turner suffered a catastrophic brain injury after doctors at Rotherham General Hospital misdiagnosed him as a Type 1 diabetic", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Nathan Sandhu", "Image", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20533877.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_SHAY_INQUEST_008.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
