Gen. Darryl Williams, 60th superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy, said on Facebook, according to WNYW.\n\nNo cause of death was mentioned.\n\nThe search for Cadet Kurita covered 6,000 acres with students, school officials, and local, state, federal and military authorities attempting to find the 20-year-old student.\n\nDuring the search, West Point officials said Sunday that an M4 rifle had also disappeared, but they didn\u2019t believe Cadet Kurita had ammunition. They said there was no indication he was a danger to the public but were afraid he might hurt himself.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, West Point said it was focusing the search on school grounds as his cellphone and bank account had shown no activity since he went missing.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank the N.Y. State Police and the 23rd MP Company along with partners,\u201d Gen. Williams said. \u201cThey exhibited exceptional professionalism as demonstrated by their tremendous efforts in searching for Cadet Kurita.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
