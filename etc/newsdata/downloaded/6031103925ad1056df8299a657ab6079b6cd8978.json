The parade featured a number of formidable weapons systems that demonstrate the growing capability of the Chinese military, the erosion of U.S. military superiority, and the need for continued action by Washington and its partners.\n\nAs expected, the parade featured the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile (or \u201ccarrier killer\u201d) as well as the DF-26 missile. The latter is a ground mobile intermediate-range ballistic missile, which extends Beijing\u2019s near-precision strike capability as far as Guam. These systems enable Beijing to target ships and bases in the region, potentially creating no-go zones for the U.S. military and its partners. If successful in this effort, Beijing may conclude it could successfully undertake military aggression, for example against Taiwan.\n\nThis week\u2019s parade also included the debut of the DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). It is a ground-mobile ICBM with a maximum range of 9,300 miles, capable of carrying multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles. That range provides Beijing the means to target the mainland United States. China has also been developing maneuverable warheads, decoys, chaff, and jamming techniques that could make the DF-41 more difficult to intercept.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Drones, missiles and much more.", "authors": ["Bradley Bowman", "Andrew Gabel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/c4aka.H0p58XfPGniHJSVw--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/74a60f384e064484427c0ab68aa86ea4", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
