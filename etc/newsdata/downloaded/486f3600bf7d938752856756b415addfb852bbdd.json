But for 21-year-old Deandre Somerville the nightmare came after he actually overslept for jury service in a Florida courtroom. A judge later punished him with a 10 day jail sentence.\n\nA judge sentenced Somerville to the jail time, plus one year on probation and 150 hours of community service after he failed to serve on a jury Aug. 21. Somerville was released Sunday.\n\nSomerville, who works at afterschool programs for the city of West Palm Beach Parks and Recreation Department, received his first ever summons for jury duty over the summer. It was also his first time ever going to the courthouse and sitting in a courtroom. He described it as a little intimidating and a little boring. After a long day of sitting and waiting, Somerville said he was picked to serve as a juror on a civil case and was told to return the following day at 9 a.m.\n\nBut he missed his alarm and woke up around 11 or 11:30 a.m. It was almost time to head to his afternoon job so he didn\u2019t bother going to the courthouse or calling the bailiff. He just hoped it would all just work out.\n\nApril 2018: 4-year-old summoned for jury duty has preschool that day\n\nOpinion: I thought jury duty was for suckers \u2014 until I helped save an innocent man from conviction\n\n\u201cAt work, I was looking on my phone thinking, \u2018What\u2019s the worst case scenario that could happen?\u2019 I thought maybe I would get a fine or something like that,\u201d Somerville said in a phone interview.\n\nSomerville lives with his grandparents and helps care for his grandfather who recently had surgery and has trouble walking. Somerville helps him around the house and takes him to therapy and the grocery store while his grandmother is at work.\n\nHe was out playing basketball when his worried grandmother called to say there was a police officer at the door with a court summons.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather said, \u2018Just go in and be honest,\u2019\u201d said Somerville. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a criminal background, never been arrested, never been in handcuffs. The most I\u2019ve ever gotten was a traffic ticket so I was thinking it wouldn\u2019t be that bad.\u201d\n\nInside the courtroom, he said Judge John Kastrenakes explained that Somerville\u2019s negligence delayed the court by 45 minutes.\n\n\u201cThey handcuffed me in the courtroom after that,\u201d said Somerville, who spent the next 10 days in jail. He said his first jail experience wasn\u2019t scary, but he prayed daily and wrote in a notebook.\n\nWhen reached by phone Thursday, the judge said he\u2019s not allowed to comment on pending court matters.\n\nSomerville said his public defender will try to lessen his probation sentence, which he called \u201cexcessive,\u201d at Friday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cNow I have a record. I almost feel like a criminal now. Now, I have to explain this in every interview,\u201d said Somerville, who said he plans to go to school to become a firefighter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/05/florida-judge-sends-juror-jail-oversleeping-missing-court/3880498002/", "description": "Deandre Somerville said he didn\u2019t bother going to the courthouse or calling the bailiff after oversleeping.
