When he moved to Arizona to attend college, he developed a cocaine addiction, and would \u201cadvertise sex for money\u201d on a chat and personnels website to help pay for more drugs. His sex and drug problem was at its worst, Van Ness added, when he moved to Los Angeles for a career in hairstyling \u2014 he regularly dabbled in methamphetamine, and despite two trips to rehab, couldn\u2019t kick the habit. It was only when he was diagnosed with H.I.V. at the age of 25 that he began to \u201cclean up\u201d his life. \u201cThat day was just as devastating as you would think it would be,\u201d Van Ness said.
