Law and order will top the bill, including \u201cdrastically increased\u201d penalties for foreign nationals who breach deportation orders. No 10 hopes it will wrestle the spotlight from this week\u2019s delicate Brexit negotiations and set the stage for a general election that few in Westminster think will be long in coming.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to see how any speech, from the Queen or not, will divert from this week\u2019s political drama, with some EU capitals concluding over the weekend that it may now be impossible for the UK to leave the EU by 31 October with a deal. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told diplomats last night that Boris Johnson\u2019s Irish border proposals remained an \u201cuntested\u201d risk that the bloc could not countenance. A leaders\u2019 summit is due to take place on Thursday, when it may become clear if a deal is doable or not. On Saturday the PM will either present the Commons with an EU-backed Brexit deal or set out his next steps. If there\u2019s no deal he has until 11pm that night to request an extension.\n\nKurds strike a deal with Damascus \u2013 In a dramatic development overnight, the Kurdish forces in north-eastern Syria are reported to have struck a deal with Damascus to stave off the bloody Turkish assault. Kurdish forces will surrender the towns of Manbij and Kobane, in exchange for help fighting the Turkish assault. Syrian state media said army units were moving north to \u201cconfront Turkish aggression on Syrian territory\u201d. The deal came amid reports that more than 700 prisoners with links to Islamic State had escaped a detention centre in the area. A French spokesperson said it was not clear who had escaped, but \u201cit has been a worry for France since the beginning of this armed intervention\u201d.\n\n\u2018The system has to change\u2019 \u2013 The women who kick-started the global #MeToo movement two years ago have warned that the allegations against Harvey Weinstein are \u201conly the tip of the iceberg\u201d. The movie mogul\u2019s former assistant and theatre producer Zelda Perkins and the actor Rosanna Arquette, hailed a \u201cprofound transformation\u201d since they spoke out, but told the Guardian there were likely more revelations to come about high-profile men abusing their positions. \u201cThe real issue is that society and the system needs to change because currently the systems all work in favour of the powerful,\u201d said Perkins. According to Melissa Silverstein, the founder of Women and Hollywood, the #MeToo movement has been \u201cnothing short of revolutionary\u201d and \u201creshaped the film industry\u2019s DNA\u201d, but film festivals as institutions are still lagging behind.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rosanna Arquette on Weinstein: \u2018There are very very powerful men in our business who feel sorry for him and that he lost his career and continue to behind the scenes figure out a way to support him.\u2019 Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images\n\nCloser to home hundreds of callers have contacted a Westminster hotline set up to help advise people who have experienced inappropriate behaviour in parliament in the aftermath of the \u201cPestminster scandal\u201d. But Labour MP Jess Phillips says the \u201cculture hasn\u2019t changed\u201d. In the City, a recent tribunal case brought by banker Stacey Macken shows sexual discrimination remains a problem, despite winning her case over pay discrimination. Macken says she was subject to persistent harassment, crude stories and targeted by a prank that involved leaving a witch\u2019s hat on her desk.\n\nPregnancy risk from drinking \u2013 Alcohol firms and the bodies they fund are encouraging expectant mothers to drink \u2013 putting their unborn child in danger \u2013 by publishing false and misleading information about the risks involved. New research, published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol, claims it is part of a drive to \u201cnudge\u201d pregnant women into continuing to drink because young people are turning away from alcohol. It found industry bodies globally are promoting \u201clight drinking\u201d as safe. Some ignored, downplayed or sparked confusion about the scientific basis of official advice to abstain completely during pregnancy.\n\nHungary election shock \u2013 Prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has suffered his first electoral blow since coming to power in 2010, with an opposition-backed candidate recording a shock win in the Budapest mayoral race overnight. Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, a centre-left, pro-European candidate, said his win was \u201chistoric\u201d; before the vote he had compared it to Istanbul\u2019s landmark mayoral race in March, which was won by an opposition candidate, in a serious blow to Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Kar\u00e1csony\u2019s win in the Hungarian capital was repeated in many places across the country. Meanwhile in Poland, the rightwing Law and Justice party is set to win a majority in the country\u2019s parliament and secure another four-year term, after exit polls showed it won 43.6% of the vote, up from 37.6% in 2015.\n\nFortnite black hole \u2013 It might be the dream of many parents, but millions of gamers were horrified when they saw an asteroid that had been looming in the game, spark up and turn into a black hole. Within a short time, the asteroid had blown up the entire map of the online battleground. A lot of time and in some cases money has been invested in the international phenomenon that is Fortnite, particularly by the most hardcore players. But many were left wondering if this was the end of the game, or just an attention-grabbing space catastrophe to mark the start of a new season (a season lasts around 10 weeks). I\u2019ll leave you to be the judge.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: What is the truth about vaping?\n\nJamie Doward and Max Sanderson join Anushka Asthana to navigate a way through the haze of the debate around vaping.

Photograph: Richard Vogel/AP\n\nLunchtime read: \u2018I\u2019ve lost people before \u2026 this is different\u2019\n\nThe pioneering musician Tricky was raised among gangsters and tough women who taught him to survive. But nothing prepared him for his biggest loss in life: his daughter, Mazy. \u201cOne of the biggest problems with my daughter is that I\u2019ve never loved anybody that much before,\u201d he tells Tim Jonze of the 24-year-old, who passed away this year. His autobiography charts his unlikely rise from young Bristol tearaway to one of British music\u2019s most creative visionaries. His hushed style of rapping and ability to reconstruct soul, punk, reggae and hip-hop into strange new shapes has long left critics scrabbling for words to define him. From an uncommon childhood, where criminality was an accepted way of life, music was an escape route. But the spotlight didn\u2019t always suit him as Hell is Round the Corner sets out.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tricky\u2019s memoir, Hell is Round the Corner, is published on 31 October.

Ben Youngs has warned Australia that England have yet to show their hand and dismissed concerns they will be undercooked for the first quarter-final in eight years against the Wallabies this weekend. Brigid Kosgei delivered a dizzying head-twister of a performance to blow away Paula Radcliffe\u2019s world marathon record, but a miserable fortnight for Mo Farah took a sharp turn for the worse in Chicago as he trudged home more than four minutes behind the leaders in his worst ever marathon time. Wales\u2019 hopes of qualifying for Euro 2020 remain alive after Gareth Bale scored and they drew 1-1 with Croatia in Cardiff, while Scotland beat San Marino 6-0 at a sodden Hampden Park. Fifteen-year-old Coco Gauff continued her extraordinary breakthrough year by defeating Jelena Ostapenko to win her first WTA title in Linz. The Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, was full of praise for the depth and versatility of her team after ending the 11-game winning run of the Women\u2019s Super League champions, Arsenal. And in his first game for Guildford Phoenix ice hockey team, the Premier League and Champions League-winning goalkeeper Petr Cech was the hero of the evening, saving the crucial shot in the penalty shootout.\n\nBusiness\n\nThe number of shoppers heading to UK high streets, retail parks and shopping centres has fallen by 10% in the last seven years, according to research. Retail footfall dropped 1.7% last month compared with the same month last year, and 1.6% on a three-month basis. \u201cWith Brexit looming, many consumers are holding off from all but essential purchases,\u201d said the British Retail Consortium chief executive, Helen Dickinson.\n\nThe pound is buying \u20ac1.142 and $1.260.\n\nThe papers\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: The Guardian\n\nBrexit is unsurprisingly splashed across many of the front pages. The Times has \u201cEU tells Johnson to give more ground on Brexit\u201d. The Telegraph says: \u201cFury as EU demands more Brexit concessions\u201d. The i has \u201cJohnson\u2019s allies attack deal as EU prepares for delay\u201d. The FT\u2019s headline is: \u201cJohnson\u2019s hopes for swift Brexit deal dented as proposals baffle EU\u201d. The Guardian has \u201cBarnier\u2019s warning as Brexit talks stutter\u201d, but saves its splash for \u201cPM seeks to thrust law and order on to agenda in Queen\u2019s speech\u201d. The Mail also focuses on the speech, with \u201cCrackdown on foreign criminals who sneak back to UK\u201d, as does the Express: \u201cBoris blitz on crooks\u201d.\n\nThe Mirror and the Sun go down different paths. The former leads with \u201cHarry\u2019s mum: meet me face to face\u201d, about the mother of the British teenager who died in a road crash flying to the US to try to meet the American diplomat\u2019s wife who is suspected of involvement in the accident. The Sun leads on the battle between the wives of footballers Wayne Rooney and Jamie Vardy: \u201cI don\u2019t like Roo anymore: Jamie deletes Wayne on Instagram\u201d.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
