Because the newspapers don't think they have done anything wrong. They think this is about reporting about what is going on.\n\n\"Secondly, the monarchy is supposed to be a unifying force in this country, and yet a very significant chunk of it, Harry and Meghan, are being divisive. It runs against what the monarchy is doing in these already divisive times.\"\n\nOther experts are concerned about Meghan and Harry's future within the Royal Family.\n\nRoyal author Phil Dampier told MailOnline : \"I am told that the senior royals from the Queen down and courtiers are very worried about the direction Harry and Meghan are taking and it's very serious.\n\n\"I hope on their six week holiday they reflect very carefully on what they do next.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"They had turned a corner with the Africa trip but all the good works were overshadowed by this attack on the press. They are either being badly advised or ignoring advice.\"\n\nHarry spoke about his relationship during the hour-long special, admitting their relationship does have difficult times.\n\nSpeaking to ITV's Tom Bradby, he said: \u201cPart of this role and part of this job and this family being under the pressure that it\u2019s under \u00adinevitably, you know, stuff happens.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\n\u201cBut look, we\u2019re brothers.
