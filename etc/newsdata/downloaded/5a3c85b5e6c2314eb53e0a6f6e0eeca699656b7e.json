But we\u2019ve got to keep moving forward. We\u2019ve got the Mountain West conference play now and that\u2019s still our goal.\u201d\n\nWeaver served as a perfect spokesperson for the Broncos\u2019 business-like approach to playing an FCS school for only the third time since 2010. Instead of getting caught looking past the Vikings, Boise State was laser focused.\n\nBut as focused as Boise State was, it didn\u2019t lack for flashy and explosive plays.\n\nJohn Hightower returned a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown to get Boise State\u2019s scoring started. C.T. Thomas scored the first of two touchdowns on a one-handed snag after getting tipped by his defender. And Stefan Cobbs scored on his first ever catch, racing 44 yards to the end zone and losing his helmet on a hit after he had scored.\n\nThen there was Weaver wreaking havoc in the Vikings\u2019 backfield on just about every play in the second half.\n\n\u201cIf (Weaver) continues to stay humble and hungry, hopefully good things keep happening,\u201d Boise State coach Bryan Harsin said.\n\nGood things have been happening by the boatloads for the Broncos\u2019 defense in the second half.\n\nBoise State (3-0) has yet to allow any points in the second half this season, joining Wisconsin as the only two schools to still hold that distinction.\n\n\u201cProtection was a problem for us all night long,\u201d Portland State coach Bruce Barnum said. \u201cWe had some things work for us early and I was pleased with the start, but we couldn\u2019t get them off the field after that first quarter.\u201d\n\nPortland State (1-2), which played Arkansas tough in a 20-13 loss in the Vikings\u2019 season opener, racked up 159 yards in the first quarter but only 85 over the final three. Last week, Boise State allowed zero yards of total offense against Marshall.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about it as a team, so it\u2019s not a thing yet,\u201d Harsin said of his team\u2019s second-half shutout streak. \u201cFor the whole team, the question has been how do we come out ready to play? The defense was ready to play tonight. We\u2019re not a total second half team yet, but we\u2019d like to be a second half team together.\u201d\n\nBoise State used its big-play offense early to bury an outmatched Vikings squad. The Broncos had 11 plays from scrimmage go for 20 yards or more, including three touchdowns.\n\nHank Bachmeier was 16-of-25 passing for 238 yards with a pair of touchdowns and one interception.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nPortland State: The Vikings were picked to finish 10th in the Big Sky but three weeks into the season look as if they might be more competitive than previously believed in one of the toughest FCS conferences in the country.\n\nBoise State: As one of the top contenders from the Group of 5 teams vying for a New Year\u2019s Six bowl game, the Broncos have little margin for error. And after cracking the rankings after an opening week upset of Florida State, Boise State appears poised to fight for that spot all the way through the end of November and has learned it has a freshman signal caller more than capable of getting the team there.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nBoise State shouldn\u2019t fall any after manhandling Portland State. And with a couple of teams close to the Broncos in the polls, Michigan State and Maryland, suffering embarrassing losses, Boise State could continue to ascend in the rankings.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPortland State closes out its non-conference schedule by traveling to Eastern Oregon on Saturday.\n\nBoise State hosts Air Force on Friday in the Mountain West conference opener for both teams.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Defensive end Curtis Weaver shrugged and smiled wryly when asked about his record-tying performance in No. 22 Boise State's 45-10 victory over Portland State on Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jason Chatraw"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/portland_st_boise_st_football_24425_c0-83-2000-1249_s1770x1032.jpg?dc2de1c8909ff8deb251977349395aa0414518db", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
