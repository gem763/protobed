The country will now return to the polling stations for the second time within six months: an unprecedented event in Israeli history.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

There are two ways in Israel: right and left. People need to decide.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if there was any chance of the Likud parting ways with Mr Netanyahu in order to speed up coalition building, she forcefully replied: \u201cNot an option.\u201d\n\nMr Netanyahu as leader is a sticking point for many parties who are concerned over his likely indictment on graft charges.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Don\u2019t be complacent! On 17 September, vote Likud,\u201d the video said.\n\nProminent pollsters reiterated reports of low voter turnout and said that there was no way a coalition can be formed, once poll predictions and the statements released by parties are taken into account.\n\n\u201cAll the party leaders have made so many whacky coalition promises and statements that if you look at them all, they have all basically banned each other,\u201d Dahlia Scheindlin, a public opinion expert who has worked on seven campaigns in Israel, told The Independent.\n\n\u201cEither someone is lying, or someone has to break their promises if we are going to avoid a third election,\u201d she added.\n\nShe said because the country is so deeply divided, the defining factor of this election is that its outcome will not be determined by who people want but by what the party leaders negotiate behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cThis election is pure a politically elite decision. Everyone knows who the public will vote for. The politicians already know their vote, everyone is waiting for the decision of the leaders,\u201d she added.\n\nMr Netanyahu is fighting to secure a record fifth term in office as prime minister which critics have said would shield him should he be indicted on corruption charges across three cases in a hearing which is due to take place after the polls.\n\nIt has been a tumultuous year for the prime master, who is Israel\u2019s longest-serving premier\n\nHe was forced to initially call early elections last year after his defence minister Avigdor Lieberman resigned and pulled his party out of the ruling coalition, leaving Mr Netanyahu with an impossible one-seat knife-edge majority.\n\nAlthough the premier secured 35 seats in the April elections and was tapped by Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, to form the next government, he failed to get enough parties on side to secure the 61 seats needed to rule.\n\nMr Lieberman, whose right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party won five seats in the polls and could have tipped the balance, once again played kingmaker, or destroyer, by refusing to join Mr Netanyahu\u2019s coalition at the 11th hour. The Likud and its supporters voted for fresh elections.\n\nMr Lieberman has nominally said in Tuesday\u2019s elections he would side with Blue and White.\n\nThe Israeli leader has, however, secured some serious wins for the right.\n\nOver the last year and half, his close relationship with Donald Trump\u2019s administration has seen the US controversially recognise the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, affirm Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which was captured from Syria during the 1967 war, and slash funding to the Palestinians.\n\nLast Wednesday, in a seemingly desperate bid to win more votes, Mr Netanyahu promised to immediately annex the Jordan Valley and north Dead Sea area of the occupied West Bank should he be re-elected. He hinted he would have the support of Donald Trump, despite the action being illegal under international law and sparking condemnation from global leaders.\n\nAfter being accused by his hawkish rivals of being too lenient with militants in Gaza, he also began warning of an imminent war in the besieged strip during a number of pre-election interviews.\n\nLeft-leaning paper Haaretz revealed on Monday that Mr Netanyahu\u2019s security advisers were even preparing to delay the elections to launch a military operation there.\n\nThe same paper also reported Mr Netanyahu nearly ordered strikes on the strip after being embarrassingly forced off stage during a rally in Ashdod last week, when rockets rained down on the southern city.\n\nLikud spokesperson Rachel Broyde insisted that the warning of a war with Gaza was not merely pre-election posturing and added that the party\u2019s biggest fear was \u201cwaking up the day after the election with a left-wing coalition\u201d.\n\nThis election is pure a politically elite decision. Everyone knows who the public will vote for Dahlia Scheindlin, public opinion expert\n\nShe said the party was not interested in joining forces with Blue and White to form a centre-left-right-wing alliance.\n\nBlue and White parliamentarians meanwhile said their number-one promise was \u201cthe establishment of a secular unity government\u201d with Likud, on the condition that Mr Netanyahu was not part of the rotation of prime ministers because of his likely indictment.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t play the left and right game. And Netanyahu cannot be prime minister in case he is indicted,\u201d Asaf Zamir, a Blue and White member of the Knesset and former mayor of Tel Aviv, told The Independent.\n\nHe was sceptical of Mr Netanyahu\u2019s pre-election pledges.\n\n\u201cEvery campaign Netanyahu promises things and never does them. I think he is fighting for his freedom from jail and from that fight, he will promise anything. Nothing will surprise me,\u201d he added.\n\nIsrael\u2019s religious parties United Torah Judaism and Shas, who are predicted to win about seven seats each, remain fiercely loyal to Mr Netanyahu and are expected to be a core part of his base that could win him a fifth term in office.\n\nBarak Seri, an adviser to Aryeh Deri, a Shas member of the Knesset and the country\u2019s minister of interior, said the ultra-orthodox party would refuse to join Blue and White because of its promise to build a secular country.\n\n\u201cShas will do everything to crown Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister,\u201d he told The Independent.", "description": "Israel\u2019s embattled prime minister is fighting for his political survival as the last polls before a fraught general election show he and his main rival, the country\u2019s former army chief, are neck and neck.
