The options for food shouldn\u2019t just be Taco Bell,\u201d Newton told SWNS.\n\nNEBRASKA STRIP CLUB CAUSES CONTROVERSY WITH 'DISTASTEFUL' MESSAGE TO MOMS\n\nNewton originally got the idea for her business \u2014 which she now calls Meals 4 Heels \u2014 in December, after hearing of how her then-girlfriend, a stripper, would complain of having nowhere healthy to eat after her shift was over. Newton then began delivering meals to her friend at the strip club, and soon other dancers started showing interest, Newton said.\n\n\u201cShe mentioned that the other dancers were intrigued and impressed by what she was eating at night and that they wanted to eat something similar.\u201d\n\nIn January, Newton officially started her business \u2014 then called \u201cMeals 4 Six-Inch Heels\u201d \u2014 selling her food to Portland\u2019s strippers, bouncers and sex workers, Willamette Week reported.\n\n\u201cThe dancers can\u2019t leave the club to get food, and in some clubs they let the cook go early to save money. Nothing is geared towards the women who work there,\u201d Newton told SWNS.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nThe former chef added that the meals \u2014 which all start with a bed of massaged kale before being topped with vegan or vegetarian options \u2014 are very friendly to those who need their energy to \u201cclimb the pole.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf strippers eat my meals, they are not going to be left hungry,\u201d Newton told SWNS. \u201cThey will be able to work, climb the pole, swing around and not feel bloated or gassy.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nRight now, Meals 4 Heels is a one-woman show, with Newton cooking and delivering each of the 20-plus orders she gets weekly, although she says she\u2019s interested in expanding the operation to other states.\n\n\u201cIt is a black-owned, female-powered business. This is a one-woman army. I go to the farmer\u2019s market, cook and prepare the food and I deliver it,\u201d she said.\n\nNewton also hopes to one day be able to give a portion of her revenue back to the community to support the sex workers of Portland, which is often said to have the highest per-capita rate of strip clubs of any U.S. city, according to Time.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFor now, though, she\u2019s at least offering some much-appreciated nourishment in the early hours of the morning.\n\n\u201cWhen you are eating bad food, you really feel it,\u201d said Julia Flores, a dancer who spoke with SWNS. \u201cIt matters what you are putting into your body \u2014 this is a very physical job.\u201d", "description": "\u201cIf strippers eat my meals, they are not going to be left hungry,\u201d said Nikeisah Newton. \u201cThey will be able to work, climb the pole, swing around and not feel bloated or gassy.\u201d", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/meals-for-heels-407597.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
