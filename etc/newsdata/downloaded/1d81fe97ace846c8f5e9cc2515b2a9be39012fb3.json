The centrist Blue and White party led by ex-armed forces chief Gantz has a slight lead with nearly all votes counted.\n\nNo party drawn from the 21% Arab minority has ever been part of an Israeli government. But an increased turnout saw the Joint List win 13 seats, making it the third largest grouping.\n\nThis would provide an outlet to voice Arab complaints of discrimination in Israeli society and give a bigger platform to Arab parties which differ markedly with those drawn from the country\u2019s Jewish majority on many political issues.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring an end to the era of Netanyahu, so we recommend that Benny Gantz be the one to form the next government,\u201d party head Ayman Odeh told Rivlin on Sunday as part of consultations to form a new government coalition.\n\nJoint List\u2019s support does not mean it will sit in the governing coalition, but its backing gives Gantz\u2019s centre-left bloc 57 seats, compared to Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing bloc of 55.\n\nNetanyahu denounced the Arab party support of Gantz. He said it meant only two choices \u2014 \u201ca minority government that leans on those that reject Israel as a Jewish, democratic state,\u201d or a \u201cbroad national government\u201d.\n\nGantz has so far rebuffed Netanyahu\u2019s calls to join a unity government.\n\nNear-final results show Blue and White will be the largest single party in the new parliament with 33 of the 120 seats, while Likud has won 31 seats, three less than it had before.\n\nIn a meeting with Likud party leaders on Sunday, Rivlin said it was up to the \u201ctwo biggest parties, the first and second that are almost equal in size, to join forces ... so that you together manage and establish a system that brings a stable government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what the people want. None of us can ignore that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president\u2019s role is largely ceremonial, but it includes consulting with factions and choosing which party leader has the best chance at forming a coalition.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThere were only narrow differences in the two main parties\u2019 campaigns on many important issues during the campaign. An end to the Netanyahu era would be unlikely to bring significant changes in policy on relations with the United States, the regional struggle against Iran, or the Palestinian conflict.\n\nNetanyahu and Gantz are now seeking other potential coalition allies, prominent among whom is the far-right former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman. He secured eight seats for his Yisrael Beitenu party, making him a potential kingmaker.\n\nLieberman on Sunday reiterated his call for a unity government and said he would not recommend either candidate in his meeting with Rivlin.", "description": "Israel's Arab-dominated Joint List party moved on Sunday to back the centre-left bloc of Benny Gantz, who is challenging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing alliance, to form a new government.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432676942&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0MQ", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
