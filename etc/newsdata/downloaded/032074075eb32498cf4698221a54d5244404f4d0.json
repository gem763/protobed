Burry\u2019s posts were thoughtful, well-reasoned and showed deep research.\n\nThe sub-Reddit WallStreetBets, with the tagline \u201cLike 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal,\u201d is rarely any of those things.\n\nThe forum\u2019s 600,000 members dub satirical options-trade commentary over scenes from TV shows like \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\u201d and rant about a loss that caused a member to get their \u201cface ripped off.\u201d Toss in a smidge of casual racism and a whiff of locker-room misogyny, and WallStreetBets is a window into the back rooms of a seedy stock-market casino with no Burry to be found.\n\nThe chat does have Eddie Choi, however. Choi said WallStreetBets taught him how to trade options -- contracts that offer the right to buy or sell a security by a specific date. Choi became a rock star on the forum last month after sharing details of his own big short -- playing Roku Inc. options.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m naturally a risk-loving person,\u201d Choi said in an interview. \u201cWhen I see these people making a lot and losing a lot of money, it caught my attention.\u201d\n\nWhen the stock of Roku, a streaming-service provider whose shares tend to fluctuate, cratered 19% on Sept. 20, Choi\u2019s initial $766 investment in Roku puts -- a bet that the stock would decline -- ballooned to $50,553 overnight, a 6,500% gain. The profit was so meaty because the puts Choi bought were close to expiration and far out of the money. Bloomberg confirmed Choi\u2019s account via screen shots of his Robinhood Financial trading history.\n\nA few days later, lightning struck again. Choi doubled his Roku winnings by buying more puts, this time on the S&P 500 exchange-traded fund. When the SPY fell to $295.87 on Sept. 24 -- the first time it closed below $297 in more than two weeks -- his $297 puts that were set to expire on Sept. 25 went ka-ching.\n\nChoi credited luck -- and WallStreetBets.\n\n\u201cI use it to develop my watch list,\u201d Choi said. \u201cOf course, there are threads where people are just trolling, but you can find good entry points.\u201d\n\n\u200bTake, for example, a posting from joeyrb that offered an explanation of why the VIX Index hasn\u2019t spiked during the trade war:\n\nIn the movie, \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d Michael Burry was played by actor Christian Bale. Choi said he wants to avoid the spotlight, so he cashed out his much smaller big short rather than risk the ridicule of his online community.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really want to stop trading options and reading WallStreetBets because it\u2019s entertaining and funny,\u201d Choi said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want to be infamous on the forum for losing all my gains.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Brandon Kochkodin in New York at bkochkodin@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: David Gillen at dgillen3@bloomberg.net, Bob Ivry, Peter Eichenbaum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Before he became famous for the big short in the 2000s, Michael Burry discussed stock trades on online message boards.
