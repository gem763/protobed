John Kelly said Saturday that he warned President Donald Trump that he would get impeached if he hired a \u201cyes man\u201d to replace him.\n\n\u201cI said whatever you do, don\u2019t hire a \u2018yes man,\u2019 someone who won\u2019t tell you the truth \u2014 don\u2019t do that. Because if you do, I believe you will be impeached,\u201d Kelly said during an interview at a political conference hosted by the Washington Examiner.\n\nKelly admitted that he had \u201csecond thoughts\u201d about leaving, after watching the chaos take place in the White House in his absence.\n\n\u201cIt pains me to see what\u2019s going on because I believe if I was still there or someone like me was there, he would not be, kind of, all over the place,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite Kelly\u2019s attempt to rein in Trump\u2019s instincts, he ultimately resigned in December 2018 after a tumultuous period in the White House with warring political factions.\n\nA former Marine general, Kelly appeared to resent his job at the White House, describing it as \u201cbone-crushing hard\u201d after he left and \u201cthe least enjoyable job\u201d he ever had.\n\nThe general signaled disapproval with the way the White House was run in his absence under Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\n\u201cThe system that should be in place, clearly \u2014 the system of advising, bringing in experts in, having these discussions with the president so he can make an informed decision, that clearly is not in place,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I feel bad that I left.\u201d", "description": "Former White House Chief of Staff Gen.
