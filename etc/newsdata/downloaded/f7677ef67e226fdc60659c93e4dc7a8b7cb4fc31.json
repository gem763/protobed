There\u2019s never been a better moment. For it to come down to the last game... the Americans played great as well but for Suzann to get the winning putt is phenomenal,\u201d a breathless Matthew said.\n\n\u201cHalf-an-hour ago it looked like a draw would be a good result but those last three games were crucial. Just fantastic. I had faith in Pettersen all the time. This is the best moment, nothing tops this. There\u2019s going to be a party!\u201d\n\nPettersen, 38, was originally selected as a vice-captain after taking time out in November 2017 to have a baby but returned this year and was given the nod for her 10th Solheim Cup appearance.\n\nPettersen, who confirmed she was retiring from the game, did not even know her final putt was to win the trophy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all just a big blur,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I was just trying to make a birdie.\n\n\u201cIn your wildest dreams, I never thought I\u2019d do this again. But you\u2019ve got to grab the moment and trust that you are good enough.\n\n\u201cThis is just a fantastic win for the team. I didn\u2019t feel much pressure, I knew my team mates wanted me on the team.\n\n\u201cThis is the perfect end to my career.\u201d\n\nEUROPE\u2019S SPIRIT\n\nThroughout an afternoon of ebbs and flows it always looked as though the Americans would scrape home, even when Europe claimed three of the first four points of the afternoon with wins for Carlota Ciganda, Georgia Hall and Celine Boutier.\n\nHall\u2019s win typified Europe\u2019s spirit as she came back from a two-hole deficit against world number three Lexi Thompson to win 2&1 and deliver her fourth point \u2014 a feat matched by Boutier.\n\nThe scoreboard then began turning American red though as rookie Brittany Altomare completed a 5&4 rout over Jodi Ewart Shadoff and Angel Yin edged out Azahara Munoz 2&1.\n\nJessica Korda, whose sister Nelly had won a point earlier, edged the U.S. into a 12-11 lead when three birdies in five holes helped her to reel in Germany\u2019s Caroline Masson.\n\nMegan Khang won the 18th to halve with Charley Hull and the experienced Lizette Salas beat distraught Dutchwoman Anne van Dam on the 18th to put the Americans on 13.5 points.\n\nThey could not get over the line though as Europe won for the sixth time in 16 editions of the team competition.\n\nInkster, who will step down after her third captaincy, was gracious in defeat, saying women\u2019s golf was the winner.\n\n\u201cIt was great, great for women\u2019s golf. Look at these crowds, it was fabulous. I\u2019m proud of my team. I\u2019m looking forward to 2021 ... watching! Watching!
